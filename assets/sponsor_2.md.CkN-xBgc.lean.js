Founded by authors Richard Grossinger and Lindy Hough in Vermont, North Atlantic Books was named partly for the North Atlantic region where it began in 1974, as well as Alan Van Newkirk's Geographic Foundation of the North Atlantic, an early (1970) ecological center founded in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, by radicals from Detroit. The publisher also cites Edward Dorn's 1960's poem, \\"North Atlantic Turbine: A Theory of Truth\\", which very early described the dangers of global commoditization by the Western World, as an inspiration in the company's name. Genres published by North Atlantic Books include internal martial arts (through its imprint Blue Snake Books), somatics, homeopathic medicine, shamanism, Martian mysteries, alternative medicine, the history and philosophy of medicine, natural foods, New Science, Buddhism, parapsychology, Western esotericism, Sufism, deep ecology, gay and lesbian studies, conspiracy theories and Jungian psychology. In 1980, North Atlantic Books was incorporated within the Society for the Study of Native Arts and Sciences, a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization. They are a client of Random House distribution services. Io Magazine While Grossinger attended Amherst College and Hough at Smith College in Massachusetts, they founded North Atlantic Books' progenitor Io Magazine, an alternative college literary magazine in 1964, featuring work from Robert Kelly, Charles Stein, and Nels Richardson, among others. Over the next decade, Io became a counter-cultural journal mixing literature, science, and history, as it came out of Michigan, Maine, and Vermont with issues such as \\"Alchemy\\", \\"Doctrine of Signatures\\", \\"Ethnoastronomy\\", \\"Oecology\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Earth Geography\\", and \\"The Olson-Melville Sourcebooks\\". Io is credited with publishing early works by Stephen King (his poem, \\"Brooklyn August,\\" was featured in Io Issue #10), Jayne Anne Phillips, poets Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, Ed Sanders, Diane di Prima, as well as the work of writers including David Wilk, Rob Brezsny, and Phoebe Gloeckner. In 2009, North Atlantic books created the Io Poetry Series, featuring collections from under-recognized voices in American poetry. Featured poets include Gerrit Lansing, Kenneth Irby, Lindy Hough, and Lenore Kandel. In 2010, Kenneth Irby's Io Poetry Series book The Intent On received the Poetry Society of America's 2010 Shelley Memorial Award. In 2012, North Atlantic Books published Collected Poems of Lenore Kandel, which included several never-before-published poems by the Beat Generation writer and an introduction by poet Diane di Prima. In 2013, it released Catching Light, a collection featuring many never-before published poems by Joanna McClure and a foreword by Michael McClure. Notable titles and authors North Atlantic Books is the publisher of the first installment of the New York Times bestselling children's book Walter the Farting Dog by William Kotzwinkle and Glenn Murray, with a 10th anniversary edition of the book published in August 2011. The publisher is also credited with publishing the complete thirteen-volume series of short stories from Nebula Award-winning science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon. Other notable works from North Atlantic include Jon Klimos's Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources (1998, ), described by Newsweek as \\"the sacred text on channeling,\\" and Patrick Doud's The Winnitok Tales, a series the Midwest Book Review praised for \\"memorable characters, poetic language, and driving narrative to these timeless tales that recall the classic epic adventure stories.‚Äù Additionally, North Atlantic has published all four volumes of poetry by Pushcart Prize-winner BJ Ward. A major motion picture adaptation of When the Game Stands Tall (2003), starring Jim Caviezel, Laura Dern, Michael Chiklis and Alexander Ludwig was scheduled to be released in fall 2014. Many notable personalities such as Oliver Sacks, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Nancy Pelosi have contributed forewords to North Atlantic titles, and the publisher counts Thich Nhat Hanh, Noam Chomsky, and Howard Zinn among those who have endorsed titles. According to filmmaker, author, and performer Miranda July, Grossinger and Hough's daughter, she and her brother were part of the company's early operations, which included \\"packing Jiffy bags with books for shipment.\\" July claims her upbringing, North Atlantic Books' presence specifically, instilled in her a love of writing \\"that is at the basis of all the things that I do.\\" Bestselling author and writer Jonathan Lethem has also been tied to North Atlantic Books as the publisher's first paid employee, and later provided an introduction for Theodore Sturgeon's book The Man Who Lost the Sea.

They have a complex experimental metal sound often including use of dissonance, intricate tempo changes and avant-garde sensibilities. Starkweather helped pioneer the hardcore punk/heavy metal crossover sound that would later be known as \\"metalcore\\", as well as being a major influence on the mathcore subgenre. They have influenced many of today's top selling hardcore/metal bands such as Converge, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Mastodon and Coalesce among many others.[ Croatan review @ Allmusic] \\"Mastodon, The Red Chord, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Killswitch Engage, Losa, The Black Dahlia Murder, Coalesce, Strapping Young Lad ... but it is important to know that Starkweather have been around longer than any of the abovementioned bands and have influenced some of them (either directly or indirectly)\\"Biography @ The Gauntlet \\"they have been cited as influence to many of today's top selling metal/hardcore bands\\" The name Starkweather is taken from Charles Starkweather, a late-1950s spree killer. Biography After recording a demo at Why Me? Recording (Turning Point, Edgewise, Brody), the band was quickly signed to Harvcore Records and released the Crossbearer LP in 1992. Starkweather made an impression with a succession of 7\\" single releases. These were followed by their first EP, Starkweather, for Inner Rage Records (1993); the Crossbearer re-issue, for Too Damn Hype (1994); their second full-length effort, Into the Wire, on Edison Recordings (1995); and the 1996 Bitter Frost / Bee Stings and Posion Eggs split with Season to Risk through Supermodel Records. Starkweather released their third album, Croatoan, in late 2005. It was produced by Pierre Remillard (mainly known for producing canadian death metal bands Cryptopsy and Gorguts), and was released only on vinyl through Hypertension Records. In that year, the band went on their first international European tour, visiting the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, England and France. 2006 saw the CD release of Croatoan on Candlelight Records.Biography @ MusicMight Croatoan features session work from bass player Liam Wilson (The Dillinger Escape Plan and Burnside) and guitarist Jim Winters (Believer, Earth Crisis, Turmoil, and The Promise) and the cover art was done by artist Paul Romano, who also worked with Mastodon, The Red Chord, Trivium, Earth, and Godflesh. After a period of inactivity, Starkweather's fourth LP This Sheltering Night was released in 2010, followed by a split LP with french band Overmars in 2011. Both recordings were produced by Alap Momin (D√§lek). Following those releases the band had some line-up changes, with founding guitarist Todd Forkin and longtime drummer Harry Rosa leaving the band. The last recordings with Forkin and Rosa were released in 2018 as a split LP with portuguese band Concealment. Style and influences Starkweather songs don't follow traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. Songs tend to have \\"narrative or cinematic flow\\", the compositions tend to emphasize an ongoing development of themes and motifs. Alex Henderson of Allmusic has described their music as \\"dissonant, jagged, angular, and discordant as well as abrasive, noisy, violent, claustrophobic, and dense\\" and an \\"extreme sensory assault\\". The band has an unusual and eclectic panel of influences; tapping into the more experimental, angular sides of hardcore and metal spheres as well as other genres. Singer Rennie Resmini's main vocal influences are Sin√©ad O'Connor, Diamanda Galas, Bj√∂rk, Michael Gira (Swans), Nick Cave (The Birthday Party), Rob 'The Baron' Miller (Amebix), and Jaz Coleman (Killing Joke) among others. The band have acknowledged that some of their primary musical influences include Voivod, Celtic Frost, Gorguts, Articles of Faith, Watchtower, Metallica, Atheist, Minor Threat, Confessor, Morbid Angel, Prong, Fates Warning and Iron Maiden; and have also shown appreciation for avant-garde composers such as Krzysztof Penderecki. Along with bands like Rorschach, Earth Crisis and Integrity, Starkweather is often credited as an early pioneer of the metalcore genre; although the band members don't consider themselves a metalcore band and have showed discontentment with the term. In an interview with Noisecreep, guitarist Todd Forkin commented negatively on the genre, stating, \\"I've heard the tag on a number of occasions that we, along with a handful of other bands, are responsible for metalcore, but to me that's like being told you're responsible for spreading cancer. You just pray that it's not true.\\" Forkin continued in the interview that he doesn't hear \\"a direct take on what we've done\\" in modern metalcore bands. Some of Starkweather's contemporaries include proto-mathcore groups Rorschach, Deadguy, Bloodlet and Converge, who play a similarly angular and unusual style of metallic hardcore. In a review for Starkweather's This Sheltering Night, Cosmo Lee of Decibel wrote, \\"If one had to assign a context for Starkweather, it would be the late '80s/early '90s, where bands like Only Living Witness and Prong were smashing together metal and hardcore‚Äîbut not quite making 'metalcore.' 'Metalcore' now implies the worst of both worlds. We're talking about the best of both worlds.\\" Members Current members * Rennie Resmini ‚Äì vocals (1989-present) * Vincent Rosa ‚Äì bass guitar * Jim Winters ‚Äì guitar (2002-2005, 2014-present) * Drew Juergens-Soto ‚Äì drums * Sean Jacobs ‚Äì bass guitar * Bill Molchanow ‚Äì session lead guitar Former members * Todd Forkin ‚Äì guitar (1989-2014) * Harry Rosa ‚Äì drums (1990-2014) * Michelle Eddison ‚Äì bass guitar (1990‚Äì1999) * Sean Roberts ‚Äì guitar * Dan McGinnis ‚Äì guitar (1990) * Liam Wilson ‚Äì bass guitar * Leonard Emerick ‚Äì drums Discography * Crossbearer (LP) (1992) Harvcore Records * Starkweather (7\\" EP) (1993) Inner Rage Records, France * Philly Dust Krew compilation cd (1993) Too Damn Hype Records * Crossbearer (studio album, 1994) re-issue of vinyl with bonus tracks on Too Damn Hype Records * A Food Not Bombs Benefit compilation LP (1994) Inchworm Records * Into The Wire (studio album, 1995) Edison Records * Bitter Frost/Bee Stings and Posion Eggs (split with Season to Risk, 1996) * Definitely Not the Majors compilation CD (1997) Bush League * Croatoan (studio, 2005) vinyl by Hypertension CD released by Candlelight Records in 2006 * This Sheltering Night (studio, 2010) CD LP released by Deathwish Inc. * \\"Split\\" Starkweather & Overmars LP released by Deathwish Inc. * Starkweather / Concealment split (2018, Translation Loss Records) ReferencesExternal links * MySpace page * Category:Hardcore punk groups from Pennsylvania Category:Deathwish Inc. artists ","title":"Starkweather (band)"},{"id":"15040374","text":"Gmina Jedwabne is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in ≈Åom≈ºa County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

Schoolboy footballer Educated at De La Salle College, he played with Richmond Thirds (Under 19) whilst still at school, and whilst still also playing for his school side (he was the school's First XVIII captain and its best and fairest player in 1964). He made his senior debut in 1964 at the Punt Road Oval, against South Melbourne, on 25 July.1964 VFL season#Round 14). He played the next 33 consecutive games for Richmond's First XVIII, winning Richmond's Most Determined Trophy in 1966. Richmond Frank, who was very courageous and very skillful, developed into a very valuable member of the Richmond senior side. In the round 15 match against Collingwood, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 6 August 1966, Frank was chasing the ball somewhere between the forward-flank and centre-half forward, bent over, with his head down, concentrating on the ball, and his hands nearly at ground level, when Paddy Guinane, running at full tilt from full-forward, bounced off Mick Erwin, and smashed into Frank's head with one of his massive thighs at full force. It was obvious that, for some inexplicable reason, Guinane had not seen Frank; and because Guinane was having one of his intermittent bad days, it is most likely he was running to get to centre-half forward, and was looking up the ground into the distance.From the Games, The Age, (Monday, 8 August 1966), p.22. Guinane nearly killed him; Dimattina was very, very badly concussed, and had a broken nose. He was replaced by the 19th man, Kevin Bartlett; and, from that time (his 24 the senior game), Bartlett was never again selected as a reserve (Prior, 1995, p. 84). Dimattina played the next match as first rover, but was replaced during the match because of an injured knee, and did not play for the rest of the year. He played six senior games in 1967, and one in 1968; however, he was never able to regain his playing form and, in, particular, he never again displayed the fearless self-confidence and the well-balanced ball skills that had been so characteristic of his play prior to that collision. Richmond released him at the end of the 1968 season. After Richmond Frank went on to play two seasons (1969/1970) with North Melbourne Football Club, and he then spent four seasons with Brunswick Football Club in the Victorian Football Association, playing 64 games and scoring 94 goals. He was captain-coach of Sorrento Football Club in 1975. Record His football record is impressive: * 1963: Richmond Thirds (Under 19), 4 games (8 goals) * 1964-1968: Richmond Football Club Reserves, 30 games (45 goals) * 1964-1968: Richmond Football Club Seniors, 42 games (43 goals), Most Determined Trophy 1966. * 1969-1970: North Melbourne Football Club Reserves, 23 games (36 goals) * 1969-1970: North Melbourne Football Club Seniors, 14 games (16 goals) * 1971-1974: Brunswick Football Club, 64 games (94 goals) * 1975: Sorrento Football Club, captain-coach Post Football Following his football career, Frank was the Richmond Senior Team Manager from 1988 to 1990. He is the owner of several restaurants, the first being the Il Gambero restaurant in Lygon Street, Carlton. His son, Paul Dimattina played 131 games for Footscray.

Specifically, with respect to a fixed circle with center and radius the inverse of a point is the point for which lies on the ray and . The inverse of the curve is then the locus of as runs over . The point in this construction is called the center of inversion, the circle the circle of inversion, and the radius of inversion. An inversion applied twice is the identity transformation, so the inverse of an inverse curve with respect to the same circle is the original curve. Points on the circle of inversion are fixed by the inversion, so its inverse is itself. Equations The inverse of the point with respect to the unit circle is where :X = \\\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2},\\\\qquad Y=\\\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}, or equivalently :x = \\\\frac{X}{X^2+Y^2},\\\\qquad y=\\\\frac{Y}{X^2+Y^2}. So the inverse of the curve determined by with respect to the unit circle is :f\\\\left(\\\\frac{X}{X^2+Y^2}, \\\\frac{Y}{X^2+Y^2}\\\\right)=0. It is clear from this that inverting an algebraic curve of degree with respect to a circle produces an algebraic curve of degree at most . Similarly, the inverse of the curve defined parametrically by the equations :x = x(t),\\\\qquad y = y(t) with respect to the unit circle is given parametrically as :\\\\begin{align} X=X(t)&=\\\\frac{x(t)}{x(t)^2 + y(t)^2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y=Y(t)&=\\\\frac{y(t)}{x(t)^2 + y(t)^2}. \\\\end{align} This implies that the circular inverse of a rational curve is also rational. More generally, the inverse of the curve determined by with respect to the circle with center and radius is :f\\\\left(a+\\\\frac{k^2(X-a)}{(X-a)^2+(Y-b)^2}, b+\\\\frac{k^2(Y-b)}{(X-a)^2+(Y-b)^2}\\\\right)=0. The inverse of the curve defined parametrically by :x = x(t),\\\\qquad y = y(t) with respect to the same circle is given parametrically as :\\\\begin{align} X=X(t)&=a+\\\\frac{k^2\\\\bigl(x(t)-a\\\\bigr)}{\\\\bigl(x(t)-a\\\\bigr)^2 + \\\\bigl(y(t)-b\\\\bigr)^2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y=Y(t)&=b+\\\\frac{k^2\\\\bigl(y(t)-b\\\\bigr)}{\\\\bigl(x(t)-a\\\\bigr)^2 + \\\\bigl(y(t)-b\\\\bigr)^2}. \\\\end{align} In polar coordinates, the equations are simpler when the circle of inversion is the unit circle. The inverse of the point with respect to the unit circle is where :R = \\\\frac{1}{r},\\\\qquad \\\\Theta=\\\\theta. So the inverse of the curve is determined by and the inverse of the curve is . Degrees As noted above, the inverse with respect to a circle of a curve of degree has degree at most . The degree is exactly unless the original curve passes through the point of inversion or it is circular, meaning that it contains the circular points, , when considered as a curve in the complex projective plane. In general, inversion with respect to an arbitrary curve may produce an algebraic curve with proportionally larger degree. Specifically, if is -circular of degree , and if the center of inversion is a singularity of order on , then the inverse curve will be an -circular curve of degree and the center of inversion is a singularity of order on the inverse curve. Here if the curve does not contain the center of inversion and if the center of inversion is a nonsingular point on it; similarly the circular points, , are singularities of order on . The value can be eliminated from these relations to show that the set of -circular curves of degree , where may vary but is a fixed positive integer, is invariant under inversion. Examples Applying the above transformation to the lemniscate of Bernoulli :\\\\left(x^2 + y^2\\\\right)^2 = a^2 \\\\left(x^2 - y^2\\\\right) gives us :a^2\\\\left(u^2-v^2\\\\right) = 1, the equation of a hyperbola; since inversion is a birational transformation and the hyperbola is a rational curve, this shows the lemniscate is also a rational curve, which is to say a curve of genus zero. If we apply the transformation to the Fermat curve , where is odd, we obtain :\\\\left(u^2+v^2\\\\right)^n = u^n+v^n. Any rational point on the Fermat curve has a corresponding rational point on this curve, giving an equivalent formulation of Fermat's Last Theorem. Particular cases For simplicity, the circle of inversion in the following cases will be the unit circle. Results for other circles of inversion can be found by translation and magnification of the original curve. =Lines= For a line passing through the origin, the polar equation is where is fixed. This remains unchanged under the inversion. The polar equation for a line not passing through the origin is :r\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0\\\\right) = a and the equation of the inverse curve is :r = a\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0\\\\right) which defines a circle passing through the origin. Applying the inversion again shows that the inverse of a circle passing through the origin is a line. =Circles= In polar coordinates, the general equation for a circle that does not pass through the origin (the other cases having been covered) is :r^2 - 2r_0 r\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0\\\\right) + r_0^2 - a^2 = 0,\\\\qquad(a>0,\\\\ r>0,\\\\ a e r_0) where is the radius and are the polar coordinates of the center. The equation of the inverse curve is then :1 - 2r_0 r\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0\\\\right) + \\\\left(r_0^2 - a^2\\\\right)r^2 = 0, or :r^2 - \\\\frac{2r_0}{r_0^2 - a^2} r\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{r_0^2 - a^2} = 0. This is the equation of a circle with radius :A = \\\\frac{a}{\\\\leftr_0^2 - a^2\\\\right} and center whose polar coordinates are :\\\\left(R_0, \\\\Theta_0\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{r_0}{r_0^2 - a^2}, \\\\theta_0\\\\right). Note that may be negative. If the original circle intersects with the unit circle, then the centers of the two circles and a point of intersection form a triangle with sides this is a right triangle, i.e. the radii are at right angles, exactly when :r_0^2 = a^2 + 1. But from the equations above, the original circle is the same as the inverse circle exactly when :r_0^2 - a^2 = 1. So the inverse of a circle is the same circle if and only if it intersects the unit circle at right angles. To summarize and generalize this and the previous section: # The inverse of a line or a circle is a line or a circle. # If the original curve is a line then the inverse curve will pass through the center of inversion. If the original curve passes through the center of inversion then the inverted curve will be a line. # The inverted curve will be the same as the original exactly when the curve intersects the circle of inversion at right angles. =Parabolas with center of inversion at the vertex= The equation of a parabola is, up to similarity, translating so that the vertex is at the origin and rotating so that the axis is horizontal, . In polar coordinates this becomes :r=\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}. The inverse curve then has equation :r=\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{\\\\cos\\\\theta} = \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta which is the cissoid of Diocles. =Conic sections with center of inversion at a focus= The polar equation of a conic section with one focus at the origin is, up to similarity : r = \\\\frac{1}{1 + e \\\\cos \\\\theta}, where e is the eccentricity. The inverse of this curve will then be : r = 1 + e \\\\cos \\\\theta, which is the equation of a lima√ßon of Pascal. When this is the circle of inversion. When the original curve is an ellipse and the inverse is a simple closed curve with an acnode at the origin. When the original curve is a parabola and the inverse is the cardioid which has a cusp at the origin. When the original curve is a hyperbola and the inverse forms two loops with a crunode at the origin. =Ellipses and hyperbolas with center of inversion at a vertex= The general equation of an ellipse or hyperbola is :\\\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\\\pm\\\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1. Translating this so that the origin is one of the vertices gives :\\\\frac{(x-a)^2}{a^2}\\\\pm\\\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 and rearranging gives :\\\\frac{x^2}{2a}\\\\pm\\\\frac{ay^2}{2b^2}=x or, changing constants, :cx^2+dy^2=x. Note that parabola above now fits into this scheme by putting and . The equation of the inverse is :\\\\frac{cx^2}{\\\\left(x^2+y^2\\\\right)^2}+\\\\frac{dy^2}{\\\\left(x^2+y^2\\\\right)^2}=\\\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} or :x\\\\left(x^2+y^2\\\\right) = cx^2+dy^2. This equation describes a family of curves called the conchoids of de Sluze. This family includes, in addition to the cissoid of Diocles listed above, the trisectrix of Maclaurin () and the right strophoid (). =Ellipses and hyperbolas with center of inversion at the center= Inverting the equation of an ellipse or hyperbola :cx^2+dy^2=1 gives :\\\\left(x^2+y^2\\\\right)^2=cx^2+dy^2 which is the hippopede. When this is the lemniscate of Bernoulli. =Conics with arbitrary center of inversion= Applying the degree formula above, the inverse of a conic (other than a circle) is a circular cubic if the center of inversion is on the curve, and a bicircular quartic otherwise. Conics are rational so the inverse curves are rational as well. Conversely, any rational circular cubic or rational bicircular quartic is the inverse of a conic. In fact, any such curve must have a real singularity and taking this point as a center of inversion, the inverse curve will be a conic by the degree formula.\\"Cubique Circulaire Rationnelle\\" at Encyclop√©die des Formes Math√©matiques Remarquables\\"Quartique Bicirculaire Rationnelle\\" at Encyclop√©die des Formes Math√©matiques Remarquables Anallagmatic curves An anallagmatic curve is one which inverts into itself.

The Ming dynasty (23 January 1368 ‚Äì 25 April 1644), officially the Great Ming or Empire of the Great Ming, founded by the peasant rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang, known as the Hongwu Emperor, was an imperial dynasty of China. It was the successor to the Yuan dynasty and the predecessor of the short-lived Shun dynasty, which was in turn succeeded by the Qing dynasty. At its height, the Ming dynasty had a population of 160 million people,Fairbank, 128. while some assert the population could actually have been as large as 200 million. Ming rule saw the construction of a vast navy and a standing army of 1,000,000 troops.Ebrey et al., East Asia, 271. Although private maritime trade and official tribute missions from China took place in previous dynasties, the size of the tributary fleet under the Muslim eunuch admiral Zheng He in the 15th century surpassed all others in grandeur. There were enormous projects of construction, including the restoration of the Grand Canal, the restoration of the Great Wall as it is seen today, and the establishment of the Forbidden City in Beijing during the first quarter of the 15th century. The Ming dynasty is, for many reasons, generally known as a period of stable effective government. It had long seen the most secure and unchallenged ruling house that China had known up until that time. Its institutions were generally preserved by the following Qing dynasty. The civil service dominated government to an unprecedented degree at this time.Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W. Mote (The Cambridge History of China, Volume 8: The Ming Dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK: 1998) pg. 9 During the Ming dynasty, the territory of China expanded (and in some cases also retracted) greatly. For a brief period during the Ming dynasty northern Vietnam was included in the Ming dynasty's territory.Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W. Mote (The Cambridge History of China, Volume 8: The Ming Dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK: 1998) pg. 10 Other important developments include the moving of the capital from Nanjing to Beijing.Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W. Mote (The Cambridge History of China, Volume 8: The Ming Dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK: 1998) pg. 11 Outside of metropolitan areas, Ming China was divided into thirteen provinces for administrative purposes. These provinces were divided along traditional and to a degree also natural lines. These include Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Huguang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou.Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W. Mote (The Cambridge History of China, Volume 8: The Ming Dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK: 1998) pg. 12 These provinces were vast areas, each being at least as large as England.Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W. Mote (The Cambridge History of China, Volume 8: The Ming Dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK: 1998) pg. 14 The longest Ming reign was that of the Wanli Emperor, who ruled for forty eight years. (1572‚Äì1620). The shortest was his son's reign, the Taichang Emperor, who ruled for only one month (in 1620).Denis C Twitchett, Frederick W. Mote (The Cambridge History of China, Volume 8: The Ming Dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK: 1998) pg. 16 Founding of the dynasty=Revolt and rebel rivalry= The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1279‚Äì1368) ruled before the establishment of the Ming dynasty. Alongside institutionalized ethnic discrimination against Han Chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion, other explanations for the Yuan's demise included overtaxing areas hard-hit by crop failure, inflation, and massive flooding of the Yellow River as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects. Consequently, agriculture and the economy were in shambles and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dikes of the Yellow River.Gascoigne, 150. A cannon from the Huolongjing, compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen before the latter's death in 1375. A number of Han Chinese groups revolted, including the Red Turbans in 1351. The Red Turbans were affiliated with the Buddhist secret society of the White Lotus, which propagated Manichean beliefs in the struggle of good against evil and worship of the Maitreya Buddha.Ebrey, et al., East Asia, 270. Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352, but soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 190‚Äì191.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 190 In 1356 Zhu's rebel force captured the city of Nanjing,Gascoigne 151. which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming dynasty. Zhu enlisted the aid of many able advisors, including the artillery specialists Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen. Zhu cemented his power in the south by eliminating his arch rival and rebel leader Chen Youliang in the Battle of Lake Poyang in 1363. This battle was‚Äîin terms of personnel‚Äîone of the largest naval battles in history. After the dynastic head of the Red Turbans suspiciously died in 1367 while hosted as a guest of Zhu, the latter made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital in 1368.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 191. The last Yuan emperor fled north into Mongolia and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu (present-day Beijing) to the ground. Instead of the traditional way of naming a dynasty after the first ruler's home district, Zhu Yuanzhang's choice of 'Ming' or 'Brilliant' for his dynasty followed a Mongol precedent of an uplifting title. Zhu Yuanzhang also took 'Hongwu', or 'Vastly Martial' as his reign title. Although the White Lotus had fomented his rise to power, the emperor later denied that he had ever been a member of their organization and suppressed the religious movement after he became emperor.Wakeman, 207. Zhu Yuanzhang, founder of the Ming dynasty, drew on both past institutions and new approaches in order to create 'jiaohua' (meaning 'civilization') as an organic Chinese governing process. This included a building of schools at all levels and an increased study of the classics as well as books on morality. Also included was the distribution of Neo-Confucian ritual manuals and a new civil service examination system for recruitment into the bureaucracy.Sarah Shneewind, Community Schools and the State in Ming China (Stanford University Press, 2006) pg. 2 =Reign of the Hongwu Emperor= Portrait of the Hongwu Emperor (r. 1368‚Äì1398) The Hongwu Emperor immediately set to rebuilding state infrastructure. He built a long wall around Nanjing, as well as new palaces and government halls. The Ming Shi states that as early as 1364 Zhu Yuanzhang had begun drafting a new Confucian law code known as the Daming Lu, which was completed by 1397 and repeated certain clauses found in the old Tang Code of 653.Andrew & Rapp, 25. The Hongwu Emperor organized a military system known as the weisuo, which was similar to the fubing system of the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907). The goal was to have soldiers become self-reliant farmers in order to sustain themselves while not fighting or training.Fairbank, 129. This system was also similar to the Yuan dynasty military organization of a hereditary caste of soldiers and a hereditary nobility of commanders. The system of the self-sufficient agricultural soldier, however, was largely a farce; infrequent rations and awards were not enough to sustain the troops, and many deserted their ranks if they weren't located in the heavily supplied frontier. Although a Confucian, the Hongwu Emperor had a deep distrust for the scholar-officials of the gentry class and was not afraid to have them beaten in court for offenses.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 191‚Äì192. In favor of Confucian learning and the civil service, the emperor ordered every county magistrate to open a Confucian school in 1369‚Äîfollowing the tradition of a nationwide school system first established by Emperor Ping of Han (9 BC‚Äì5 AD).Brook, xix.Yuan, 193. However, he halted the civil service examinations in 1373 after complaining that the 120 scholar-officials who obtained a jinshi degree were incompetent ministers.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 192.Hucker, 13. After the examinations were reinstated in 1384, he had the chief examiner executed after it was discovered that he allowed only candidates from the south to be granted jinshi degrees. In 1380, the Hongwu Emperor had the Chancellor Hu Weiyong executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him; after that the emperor abolished the Chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 192Fairbank, 130. With a growing amount of suspicion for his ministers and subjects, the Hongwu Emperor established the Jinyiwei, a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard. They were partly responsible for the loss of 100,000 lives in several major purges over three decades of his rule.Fairbank, 129‚Äì130. =North-Western Frontier= Multiple conflicts arose with the Ming dynasty fighting against the Uyghur Kingdom of Turpan and Oirat Mongols on the Northwestern Border, near Gansu, Turpan, and Hami. The Ming dynasty took control of Hami (under a small kingdom called Qara Del) in 1404 and turned it into Hami Prefecture In 1406, the Ming dynasty defeated the ruler of Turpan., which would lead to a lengthy war. The Moghul ruler of Turpan Yunus Khan, also known as ·∏§ƒÅjjƒ´ \`Ali (ruled 1462‚Äì78), unified Moghulistan (roughly corresponding to today's Eastern Xinjiang) under his authority in 1472. Asserting his newfound power, ·∏§ƒÅjjƒ´ \`Ali sought redress of old grievances between the Turpanians and Ming China began over the restrictive tributary trade system. Tensions rose, and in 1473 he led a campaign east to confront China, even succeeding in capturing Hami from the Oirat Mongol ruler Henshen. Ali traded control of Hami with the Ming, then Henshen's Mongols, in numerous battles spanning the reigns of his son Ahmed and his grandson Mansur in a drawn-out and complex series of conflicts now known as the Ming‚ÄìTurpan conflict. =South-Western Frontier= The old south gate of Dali, Yunnan, which was established as a Chinese-style city in 1382 shortly after the Ming conquest of the region. In 1381, the Ming dynasty annexed the areas of the southwest that had once been part of the Kingdom of Dali, which was annihilated by the Mongols in the 1250s and became established as the Yunnan Province under Yuan dynasty later on. By the end of the 14th century, some 200,000 military colonists settled some 2,000,000 mu (350,000 acres) of land in what is now Yunnan and Guizhou.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 195. Roughly half a million more Chinese settlers came in later periods; these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic make-up of the region, since more than half of the roughly 3,000,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the Ming dynasty were non-Han peoples. In this region, the Ming government adopted a policy of dual administration. Areas with majority ethnic Chinese were governed according to Ming laws and policies; areas where native tribal groups dominated had their own set of laws while tribal chiefs promised to maintain order and send tribute to the Ming court in return for needed goods. From 1464 to 1466, the Miao and Yao people of Guangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou revolted against what they saw as oppressive government rule; in response, the Ming government sent an army of 30,000 troops (including 1,000 Mongols) to join the 160,000 local troops of Guangxi and crushed the rebellion.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 197. After the scholar and philosopher Wang Yangming (1472‚Äì1529) suppressed another rebellion in the region, he advocated joint administration of Chinese and local ethnic groups in order to bring about sinification in the local peoples' culture. =Relations with Tibet= A 17th-century Tibetan thangka of Guhyasamaja Akshobhyavajra; the Ming dynasty court gathered various tribute items which were native products of Tibet (such as thangkas),Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Testimony of History, 73. and in return granted Tibetan tribute-bearers with gifts.Wang Jiawei & Nyima Gyaincain, The Historical Status of China's Tibet (China Intercontinental Press, 1997), 39‚Äì41. The Mingshi‚Äî the official history of the Ming dynasty compiled later by the Qing court in 1739‚Äîstates that the Ming established itinerant commanderies overseeing Tibetan administration while also renewing titles of ex-Yuan dynasty officials from Tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of Tibet's Buddhist sects.Mingshi-Geography I \\"ÊòéÂè≤‚Ä¢Âú∞ÁêÜ‰∏Ä\\": Êù±Ëµ∑ÊúùÈÆÆÔºåË•øÊìöÂêêÁï™ÔºåÂçóÂåÖÂÆâÂçóÔºåÂåóË∑ùÂ§ßÁ£ß„ÄÇ; Geography III \\"ÊòéÂè≤‚Ä¢Âú∞ÁêÜ‰∏â\\": ‰∏ÉÂπ¥‰∏ÉÊúàÁΩÆË•øÂÆâË°åÈÉΩË°õÊñºÊ≠§ÔºåÈ†òÊ≤≥Â∑û„ÄÅÊúµÁîò„ÄÅÁÉèÊñØËóè„ÄÅ‰∏âË°õ„ÄÇ; Western territory III \\"ÊòéÂè≤‚Ä¢ÂàóÂÇ≥Á¨¨‰∫åÁôæÂçÅ‰∏ÉË•øÂüü‰∏â\\" However, Turrell V. Wylie states that censorship in the Mingshi in favor of bolstering the Ming emperor's prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming era. Modern scholars still debate on whether or not the Ming dynasty really had sovereignty over Tibet at all, as some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty which was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521‚Äì1567) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court.Wylie, 470.Wang & Nyima, 1‚Äì40.Laird, 106‚Äì107. Helmut Hoffman states that the Ming upheld the facade of rule over Tibet through periodic missions of \\"tribute emissaries\\" to the Ming court and by granting nominal titles to ruling lamas, but did not actually interfere in Tibetan governance.Hoffman, 65. Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain disagree, stating that Ming China had sovereignty over Tibetans who did not inherit Ming titles, but were forced to travel to Beijing to renew them.Wang & Nyima, 37. Melvyn C. Goldstein writes that the Ming had no real administrative authority over Tibet since the various titles given to Tibetan leaders already in power did not confer authority as earlier Mongol Yuan titles had; according to him, \\"the Ming emperors merely recognized political reality.\\"Goldstein, 4‚Äì5. Some scholars argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship.Norbu, 52.Kolmas, 32. Others underscore the commercial aspect of the relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's insufficient number of horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade with Tibet.Wang & Nyima, 39‚Äì40.Sperling, 474‚Äì475, 478.Perdue, 273.Kolmas, 28‚Äì29.Laird, 131 Scholars also debate on how much power and influence‚Äîif any‚Äîthe Ming dynasty court had over the de facto successive ruling families of Tibet, the Phagmodru (1354‚Äì1436), Rinbung (1436‚Äì1565), and Tsangpa (1565‚Äì1642).Kolmas, 29.Chan, 262.Norbu, 58.Wang & Nyima, 42.Dreyfus, 504. The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century, while at times the Tibetans also used successful armed resistance against Ming forays.Langlois, 139 & 161.Geiss, 417‚Äì418. Patricia Ebrey, Thomas Laird, Wang Jiawei, and Nyima Gyaincain all point out that the Ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in Tibet,Laird, 137.Ebrey (1999), 227.Wang & Nyima, 38. unlike the former Mongol Yuan dynasty. The Wanli Emperor (r. 1572‚Äì1620) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations in the wake of a Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578, the latter of which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Manchu Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) of China in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Yellow Hat sect.Kolmas, 30‚Äì31.Goldstein, 8.Laird, 143‚Äì144.The Ming Biographical History Project of the Association for Asian Studies, Dictionary of Ming Biography, 23. By the late 16th century, the Mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama after their increasing presence in the Amdo region, culminating in G√ºshi Khan's (1582‚Äì1655) conquest of Tibet in 1642.Kolmas, 34‚Äì35.Goldstein, 6‚Äì9.Laird, 152. The Hongwu Emperor's vision, commercialization, and reversing his policies=Fusion of the merchant and gentry classes= Pagoda of Famen Temple, built in 1579; the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to geomantic principles brought about auspicious events;Brook, 7. merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period. In the first half of the Ming era, scholar-officials would rarely mention the contribution of merchants in society while writing their local gazetteer;Brook, 73. officials were certainly capable of funding their own public works projects, a symbol of their virtuous political leadership.Brook, 6‚Äì7, 90‚Äì91. However, by the second half of the Ming era it became common for officials to solicit money from merchants in order to fund their various projects, such as building bridges or establishing new schools of Confucian learning for the betterment of the gentry.Brook, 90‚Äì93. From that point on the gazetteers began mentioning merchants and often in high esteem, since the wealth produced by their economic activity produced resources for the state as well as increased production of books needed for the education of the gentry.Brook, 90‚Äì93, 129‚Äì130, 151. Merchants began taking on the highly cultured, connoisseur's attitude and cultivated traits of the gentry class, blurring the lines between merchant and gentry and paving the way for merchant families to produce scholar-officials.Brook, 128‚Äì129, 134‚Äì138. The roots of this social transformation and class indistinction could be found in the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279),Gernet, 60‚Äì61, 68‚Äì69. but it became much more pronounced in the Ming. Writings of family instructions for lineage groups in the late Ming period display the fact that one no longer inherited his position in the categorization of the four occupations (in descending order): gentry, farmers, artisans, and merchants.Brook, 161. =Courier network and commercial growth= The Hongwu Emperor believed that only government couriers and lowly retail merchants should have the right to travel far outside their home town.Brook, 65‚Äì67. Despite his efforts to impose this view, his building of an efficient communication network for his military and official personnel strengthened and fomented the rise of a potential commercial network running parallel to the courier network.Brook, 10, 49‚Äì51, 56. The shipwrecked Korean Ch'oe Pu (1454‚Äì1504) remarked in 1488 how the locals along the eastern coasts of China did not know the exact distances between certain places, which was virtually exclusive knowledge of the Ministry of War and courier agents.Brook, 40‚Äì43. This was in stark contrast to the late Ming period, when merchants not only traveled further distances to convey their goods, but also bribed courier officials to use their routes and even had printed geographical guides of commercial routes that imitated the couriers' maps.Brook, 10, 118‚Äì119. =An open market, silver, and Deng Maoqi's rebellion= The only surviving piece of furniture from the \\"Orchard Factory\\" (the Imperial Lacquer Workshop) set up in Beijing in the early Ming dynasty. Decorated in dragons and phoenixes, it was made during the Xuande era (1426‚Äì1435). The imperial workshops in the Ming era were overseen by a eunuch bureau.Hucker, 25. (See closeup for detail) The scholar-officials' dependence upon the economic activities of the merchants became more than a trend when it was semi-institutionalized by the state in the mid Ming era. Qiu Jun (1420‚Äì1495), a scholar-official from Hainan, argued that the state should only mitigate market affairs during times of pending crisis and that merchants were the best gauge in determining the strength of a nation's riches in resources.Brook, 102. The government followed this guideline by the mid Ming era when it allowed merchants to take over the state monopoly of salt production. This was a gradual process where the state supplied northern frontier armies with enough grain by granting merchants licenses to trade in salt in return for their shipping services.Brook, 108. The state realized that merchants could buy salt licenses with silver and in turn boost state revenues to the point where buying grain was not an issue. Silver mining was increased dramatically during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (1402‚Äì1424); production of mined silver rose from 3007 kg (80,185 taels) in 1403 to 10,210 kg (272,262 taels) in 1409. The Hongxi Emperor (r. 1424‚Äì1425) attempted to scale back silver mining to restore the discredited paper currency, but this was a failure which his immediate successor, the Xuande Emperor (r. 1425‚Äì1435), remedied by continuing the Yongle Emperor's silver mining scheme. The governments of the Hongwu and Zhengtong (r. 1435‚Äì1449) emperors attempted to cut the flow of silver into the economy in favor of paper currency, yet mining the precious metal simply became a lucrative illegal pursuit practiced by many.Brook, 68‚Äì69, 81‚Äì83. golden crown from the Ming dynasty. The failure of these stern regulations against silver mining prompted ministers such as the censor Liu Hua (jinshi graduate in 1430) to support the baojia system of communal self-defense units to patrol areas and arrest 'mining bandits' (kuangzei).Brook 81‚Äì82. Deng Maoqi (died 1449), an overseer in this baojia defense units in Sha County of Fujian, abused local landlords who attempted to have him arrested; Deng responded by killing the local magistrate in 1447 and started a rebellion.Brook, 84. By 1448, Deng's forces took control of several counties and were besieging the prefectural capital. The mobilization of local baojia units against Deng was largely a failure; in the end it took 50,000 government troops (including later Mongol rebels who sided with Cao Qin's rebellion in 1461),Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 99. with food supplies supported by local wealthy elites, to put down Deng's rebellion and execute the so-called \\"King Who Eliminates Evil\\" in the spring of 1449. Many ministers blamed ministers such as Liu Hua for promoting the baojia system and thus allowing this disaster to occur. The historian Tanaka Masatoshi regarded \\"Deng's uprising as the first peasant rebellion that resisted the class relationship of rent rather than the depredations of officials, and therefore as the first genuinely class-based 'peasant warfare' in Chinese history.\\"Brook, 85. The Hongwu Emperor was unaware of economic inflation even as he continued to hand out multitudes of banknotes as awards; by 1425, paper currency was worth only 0.025% to 0.014% its original value in the 14th century.Fairbank, 134. The value of standard copper coinage dropped significantly as well due to counterfeit minting; by the 16th century, new maritime trade contacts with Europe provided massive amounts of imported silver, which increasingly became the common medium of exchange.Fairbank, 134‚Äì135. As far back as 1436, a portion of the southern grain tax was commuted to silver, known as the Gold Floral Silver (jinhuayin).Brook, xx. This was an effort to aid tax collection in counties where transportation of grain was made difficult by terrain, as well as provide tax relief to landowners.Brook 81. In 1581 the Single Whip Reform installed by Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (1525‚Äì1582) finally assessed taxes on the amount of land paid entirely in silver.Brook, xxi, 89. Reign of the Yongle Emperor Portrait of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402‚Äì1424). =Rise to power= The Hongwu Emperor's grandson, Zhu Yunwen, assumed the throne as the Jianwen Emperor (1398‚Äì1402) after the Hongwu Emperor's death in 1398. In a prelude to a three-year-long civil war beginning in 1399,Robinson (2000), 527. The Jianwen Emperor became engaged in a political showdown with his uncle Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan. The emperor was aware of the ambitions of his princely uncles, establishing measures to limit their authority. The militant Zhu Di, given charge over the area encompassing Beijing to watch the Mongols on the frontier, was the most feared of these princes. After the Jianwen Emperor arrested many of Zhu Di's associates, Zhu Di plotted a rebellion. Under the guise of rescuing the young Jianwen Emperor from corrupt officials, Zhu Di personally led forces in the revolt; the palace in Nanjing was burned to the ground, along with the Jianwen Emperor, his wife, mother, and courtiers. Zhu Di assumed the throne as the Yongle Emperor (1402‚Äì1424); his reign is universally viewed by scholars as a \\"second founding\\" of the Ming dynasty since he reversed many of his father's policies.Atwell (2002), 84. =A new capital and a restored canal= The Yongle Emperor demoted Nanjing as a secondary capital and in 1403 announced the new capital of China was to be at his power base in Beijing. Construction of a new city there lasted from 1407 to 1420, employing hundreds of thousands of workers daily. At the center was the political node of the Imperial City, and at the center of this was the Forbidden City, the palatial residence of the emperor and his family. By 1553, the Outer City was added to the south, which brought the overall size of Beijing to 4 by 4¬Ω miles.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 194. The Ming tombs located north of Beijing; the site was chosen by the Yongle Emperor. After lying dormant and dilapidated for decades, the Grand Canal was restored under the Yongle Emperor's rule from 1411‚Äì1415. The impetus for restoring the canal was to solve the perennial problem of shipping grain north to Beijing. Shipping the annual 4,000,000 shi (one shi is equal to 107 liters) was made difficult with an inefficient system of shipping grain through the East China Sea or by several different inland canals that necessitated the transferring of grain onto several different barge types in the process, including shallow and deep-water barges.Brook, 46‚Äì47. William Atwell quotes Ming dynasty sources that state the amount of collected tax grain was actually 30 million shi (93 million bushels),Atwell (2002), 86. much larger than what Brook notes. The Yongle Emperor commissioned some 165,000 workers to dredge the canal bed in western Shandong and built a series of fifteen canal locks.Brook, 47. The reopening of the Grand Canal had implications for Nanjing as well, as it was surpassed by the well-positioned city of Suzhou as the paramount commercial center of China.Brook, 74‚Äì75. Despite greater efficiency, there were still factors which the government could not control that limited the transportation of taxed grain; for example, in 1420 a widespread crop failure and poor harvest dramatically reduced the tax grain delivered to the central government.Atwell (2002), 84, footnote 2. Although the Yongle Emperor ordered episodes of bloody purges like his father‚Äîincluding the execution of Fang Xiaoru, who refused to draft the proclamation of his succession‚Äîthe emperor had a different attitude about the scholar-officials.Ebrey et al., East Asia, 272. He had a selection of texts compiled from the Cheng-Zhu school of Confucianism‚Äîor Neo-Confucianism‚Äîin order to assist those who studied for the civil service examinations. The Yongle Emperor commissioned two thousand scholars to create a 50-million-word (22,938-chapter) long encyclopedia‚Äîthe Yongle Encyclopedia‚Äîfrom seven thousand books. This surpassed all previous encyclopedias in scope and size, including the 11th-century compilation of the Four Great Books of Song. Yet the scholar-officials were not the only political group that the Yongle Emperor had to cooperate with and appease. Historian Michael Chang points out that the Yongle Emperor was an \\"emperor on horseback\\" who often traversed between two capitals like in the Mongol tradition and constantly led expeditions into Mongolia.Chang (2007), 66‚Äì67. This was opposed by the Confucian establishment while it served to bolster the importance of eunuchs and military officers whose power depended upon the emperor's favor. =The treasure fleet= A giraffe brought from Africa in the twelfth year of Yongle (1414); the Chinese associated the giraffe with the mythical qilin. Beginning in 1405, the Yongle Emperor entrusted his favored eunuch commander Zheng He (1371‚Äì1433) as the naval admiral for a gigantic new fleet of ships designated for international tributary missions. The Chinese had sent diplomatic missions over land and west since the Han dynasty (202 BC‚Äì220 AD) and had been engaged in private overseas trade leading all the way to East Africa for centuries‚Äîculminating in the Song and Yuan dynasties‚Äîbut no government-sponsored tributary mission of this grandeur size had ever been assembled before. To service seven different tributary missions abroad, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, which included the large Chinese treasure ships that measured 112 m (370 ft) to 134 m (440 ft) in length and 45 m (150 ft) to 54 m (180 ft) in width.Fairbank, 137. The first voyage from 1405 to 1407 contained 317 vessels with a staff of 70 eunuchs, 180 medical personnel, 5 astrologers, and 300 military officers commanding a total estimated force of 26,800 men.Fairbank, 137‚Äì138. The enormous tributary missions were discontinued after the death of Zheng He, yet his death was only one of many culminating factors which brought the missions to an end. The Ming Empire had conquered and annexed Vietnam in 1407, but Ming troops were pushed out in 1428 with significant costs to the Ming treasury; in 1431 the new L√™ dynasty of Vietnam was recognized as an independent tribute state.Fairbank, 138. There was also the threat and revival of Mongol power on the northern steppe which drew court attention away from other matters. The Yongle Emperor had staged enormous invasions deep into Mongol territory, competing with Korea for lands in Manchuria as well. To face the Mongol threat to the north, a massive amount of funds were used to build the Great Wall after 1474.Fairbank, 139. The Yongle Emperor's moving of the capital from Nanjing to Beijing was largely in response to the court's need of keeping a closer eye on the Mongol threat in the north.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 80. Scholar-officials also associated the lavish expense of the fleets with eunuch power at court, and so halted funding for these ventures as a means to curtail further eunuch influence.Fairbank, 138‚Äì139. The Tumu Crisis and the Ming Mongols=Succession crisis= The Oirat Mongol leader Esen Tayisi launched an invasion into Ming China in July 1449. The chief eunuch Wang Zhen encouraged the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435‚Äì1449) to personally lead a force to face the Mongols after a recent Ming defeat; marching off with 50,000 troops, the emperor left the capital and put his half-brother Zhu Qiyu in charge of affairs as temporary regent. In the battle that ensued, his force of 50,000 troops were decimated by Esen's army. On 3 September 1449, the Zhengtong Emperor was captured and held in captivity by the Mongols‚Äîan event known as the Tumu Crisis.Ebrey et al., East Asia. 273. After the Zhengtong Emperor's capture, Esen's forces plundered their way across the countryside and all the way to the suburbs of Beijing.Robinson, \\"Banditry and the Subversion of State Authority in China,\\" 533‚Äì534. Following this was another plundering of the Beijing suburbs in November of that year by local bandits and Ming dynasty soldiers of Mongol descent who dressed as invading Mongols.Robinson, \\"Banditry and the Subversion of State Authority in China,\\" 534. Many Han Chinese also took to brigandage soon after the Tumu incident.Yingzong Shilu, 184.17b, 185.5b.Robinson (1999), 85, footnote 18. The Zhengtong Emperor; after deposing his half-brother, the Jingtai Emperor, in 1457, he ascended the throne again as the Tianshun Emperor. The Mongols held the Zhengtong Emperor for ransom. However, this scheme was foiled once the emperor's younger brother assumed the throne as the Jingtai Emperor (r. 1449‚Äì1457); the Mongols were also repelled once the Jingtai Emperor's confidant and defense minister Yu Qian (1398‚Äì1457) gained control of the Ming armed forces. Holding the Zhengtong Emperor in captivity was a useless bargaining chip by the Mongols as long as another sat on his throne, so they released him back into Ming China. The Zhengtong Emperor was placed under house arrest in the palace until the coup against the Jingtai Emperor in 1457, which is known as the \\"Wresting the Gate Incident\\".Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China\\", 83. The Zhengtong Emperor retook the throne as the Tianshun Emperor (r. 1457‚Äì1464). =Relocation, migration, and northern raids= The Mongol threat to China was at its greatest level in the 15th century, although periodic raiding continued throughout the dynasty. Like in the Tumu Crisis, the Mongol leader Altan Khan (r. 1470‚Äì1582) invaded China and raided as far as the outskirts of Beijing.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China\\", 81.Laird, 141. The Ming employed troops of Mongol descent to fight back Altan Khan's invasion, as well as Mongol military officers against Cao Qin's abortive coup of 1461.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 83, 101. Mongol troops were also employed in the suppression of the Li people of Hainan in the early 16th century as well as the Liu Brothers and Tiger Yang in a 1510 rebellion. The Mongol incursions prompted the Ming authorities to construct the Great Wall from the late 15th century to the 16th century; John Fairbank notes that \\"it proved to be a futile military gesture but vividly expressed China's siege mentality.\\" Yet the Great Wall was not meant to be a purely defensive fortification; its towers functioned rather as a series of lit beacons and signalling stations to allow rapid warning to friendly units of advancing enemy troops.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 208. The Tianshun Emperor's reign was a troubled one and Mongol forces within the Ming military structure continued to be problematic. Mongols serving the Ming military also became increasingly circumspect as the Chinese began to heavily distrust their Mongol subjects after the Tumu Crisis.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 96‚Äì97. One method to ensure that Mongols could not band together in significant numbers in the north was a scheme of relocation and sending their troops on military missions to southern China.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 84‚Äì86. In January 1450, two thousand Mongol troops stationed in Nanjing were sent to Fujian in order to suppress a brigand army. The grand coordinator of Jiangxi, Yang Ning (1400‚Äì1458), suggested to the Jingtai Emperor that these Mongols be dispersed amongst the local battalions, a proposal that the emperor agreed to (the exact number of Mongols resettled in this fashion is unknown).Robinson, Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China, 87‚Äì88. Despite this, Mongols continued to migrate to Beijing. A massive drought in August 1457 forced over five hundred Mongol families living on the steppe to seek refuge in China, entering through the Piantou Pass of northwestern Shanxi.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China\\", 95. According to the official report by the chief military officer of Piantou Pass, all of these Mongol families populated Beijing, where they were granted lodging and stipends. In July 1461, after Mongols had staged raids in June into Ming territory along the northern tracts of the Yellow River, the Minister of War Ma Ang (1399‚Äì1476) and General Sun Tang (died 1471) were appointed to lead a force of 15,000 troops to bolster the defenses of Shaanxi.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 95‚Äì96. Historian David M. Robinson states that \\"these developments must also have fed suspicion about Mongols living in North China, which in turn exacerbated Mongol feelings of insecurity. However, no direct link can be found between the decision by the Ming Mongols in Beijing to join the [1461] coup and activities of steppe Mongols in the northwest.\\"Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 96. =The failed coup of 1461= The Great Wall of China; although the rammed earth walls of the ancient Warring States were combined into a unified wall under the Qin and Han dynasties, the vast majority of the brick and stone Great Wall as it is seen today is a product of the Ming dynasty. On 7 August 1461, the Chinese general Cao Qin (died 1461) and his Ming troops of Mongol descent staged a coup against the Tianshun Emperor out of fear of being next on his purge-list of those who aided him in the Wresting the Gate Incident.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 84‚Äì85. On the previous day, the emperor issued an edict telling his nobles and generals to be loyal to the throne; this was in effect a veiled threat to Cao Qin, after the latter had his associate in the Jinyiwei beaten to death to cover up crimes of illegal foreign transactions.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 97. Due to the earlier demise of General Shi Heng in 1459, in a similar warning involving an imperial edict, Cao Qin was to take no chances in allowing himself to be ruined in similar fashion.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 97‚Äì98. The loyalty of Cao's Mongol-officer clients was secure due to circumstances of thousands of military officers who had to accept demotions in 1457 because of earlier promotions in aiding the Jingtai Emperor's succession.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 100. Robinson states that \\"Mongol officers no doubt expected that if Cao fell from power, they would soon follow.\\" Cao either planned to kill Ma Ang and Sun Tang as they were to depart the capital with 15,000 troops to Shaanxi on the morning of 7 August, or he simply planned to take advantage of their leave.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 98‚Äì99. The conspirators are said to have planned to place their heir apparent on the throne and demote the Tianshun Emperor's position to \\"grand senior emperor\\", the title granted to him during the years of his house arrest. After a failed plot to have Grand Secretary Li Xian send a memorial to the throne to pardon Cao Qin for killing Lu Gao, head of the Jinyiwei who had been investigating him, Cao Qin began the assault on Dongan Gate, East Chang'an Gate, and West Chang'an Gate, setting fire to the western and eastern gates; these fires were extinguished later in the day by pouring rain.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 104‚Äì105. Ming troops poured into the area outside the Imperial City to counterattack.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force, and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 106‚Äì107. By midday, Sun Tang's forces had killed two of Cao Qin's brothers and severely wounded Cao in both his arms; his forces took up position in the Great Eastern Market and Lantern Market northeast of Dongan Gate, while Sun deployed artillery units against the rebels.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 107. Cao lost his third brother, Cao Duo, while attempting to flee out of Beijing by the Chaoyang Gate.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 108. Cao fled with his remaining forces to fortify his residential compound in Beijing; Ming troops stormed the residence and Cao Qin committed suicide by throwing himself down a well. As promised by Li Xian before they stormed the residence, imperial troops were allowed to confiscate the property of Cao Qin for themselves.Robinson, \\"Politics, Force and Ethnicity in Ming China,\\" 108‚Äì109. Isolation to globalization Ming rulers faced the challenge of balancing Central Asian trade and military threats against dangerous but profitable sea powers. The questions were cultural, political, and economic. The historian Arthur Waldron declares that the early rulers faced the question \\"Was the Ming to be essentially a Chinese version of the Yuan, or was it to be something new?\\" The Tang dynasty provided an example of cosmopolitan and culturally flexible rule, but the Song dynasty, which never controlled key areas of Central Asia, offered an example that was culturally Han Chinese. The dynasty was basically reshaped by it successes and frustrations in dealing with the two sides of the outside world. =Universal rulership= The early Ming emperors from the Hongwu Emperor to the Zhengde Emperor continued Yuan practices such as hereditary military institutions, demanding Korean and Muslim concubines and eunuchs, having Mongols serve in the Ming military, patronizing Tibetan Buddhism, with the early Ming Emperors seeking to project themselves as \\"universal rulers\\" to various peoples such as Central Asian Muslims, Tibetans, and Mongols. The Yongle Emperor cited Emperor Taizong of Tang as a model for being familiar with both China and the steppe people. The legacy of the Mongol Khan's as supporters of both Eastern and western religions, ruler ship over the plains and steppes, was claimed by the Ming such as patronizing Islam and using the Chinese, Persian, and Mongol languages in edicts on Islam which were also used by the Yuan to show the Ming were the heirs to this Yuan legacy. =Illegal trade, piracy, and war with Japan= Japanese pirate raids. In 1479, the vice president of the Ministry of War burned the court records documenting Zheng He's voyages; it was one of many events signalling China's shift to an inward foreign policy.Fairbank, 138. Shipbuilding laws were implemented that restricted vessels to a small size; the concurrent decline of the Ming navy allowed the growth of piracy along China's coasts. Japanese pirates‚Äîor wokou‚Äîbegan staging raids on Chinese ships and coastal communities, although much of the acts of piracy were carried out by native Chinese. Instead of mounting a counterattack, Ming authorities chose to shut down coastal facilities and starve the pirates out; all foreign trade was to be conducted by the state under the guise of formal tribute missions. These were known as the hai jin laws, a strict ban on private maritime activity until its formal abolishment in 1567. In this period government-managed overseas trade with Japan was carried out exclusively at the seaport of Ningbo, trade with the Philippines exclusively at Fuzhou, and trade with Indonesia exclusively at Guangzhou. Even then the Japanese were only allowed into port once every ten years and were allowed to bring a maximum of three hundred men on two ships; these laws encouraged many Chinese merchants to engage in widespread illegal trade and smuggling. The low point in relations between Ming China and Japan occurred during the rule of the great Japanese warlord Hideyoshi, who in 1592 announced he was going to conquer China. In two campaigns (now known collectively as the Imjin War) the Japanese fought with the Korean and Ming armies. Though initially successful, the Japanese forces were pushed back southward after the intervention of Ming China. With the combined strength of Ming and Korean forces on land, and the naval prowess of Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin at sea, the campaign ended in defeat for the Japanese and their armies were forced to withdraw from the Korean peninsula. However, the victory came at relatively large cost to the Ming government's treasury: some 26,000,000 ounces of silver.Ebrey et al., East Asia, 214. =Trade and contact with Europe= Timothy Brook's The Confusions of Pleasure. The History of Ming, compiled during the early Qing dynasty, describes how the Hongwu Emperor met with an alleged merchant of Fu lin (ÊãÇËèª; i.e. the Byzantine Empire) named \\"Nieh-ku-lun\\" (ÊçèÂè§ÂÄ´). In September 1371 he had this man sent back to his native country with a letter announcing the founding of the Ming dynasty to his ruler (i.e. John V Palaiologos). It is speculated that the merchant was actually a former bishop of Khanbaliq (Beijing) called Nicolaus de Bentra, sent by Pope John XXII to replace archbishop John of Montecorvino in 1333. The History of Ming goes on to explain that contacts between China and Fu lin ceased after this point, whereas diplomats and other people of the great western sea (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea) did not appear in China again until the 16th century, with the Italian Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci. Although Jorge √Ålvares was the first to land on Lintin Island in the Pearl River Delta in May 1513, it was Rafael Perestrello‚Äîa cousin of the famed Christopher Columbus‚Äîwho became the first known European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in Guangzhou in 1516, commanding a Portuguese vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from Malacca.Brook, 124. However, Chinese records maintain that a Roman embassy, perhaps only a group of Roman merchants, arrived at the Han capital city Luoyang by way of Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) in 166 AD, during the reigns of emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161‚Äì180 AD) and Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146‚Äì168 AD).; Although it could be coincidental, Antonine Roman golden medallions dated to the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his predecessor Antoninus Pius have been discovered at Oc Eo, Vietnam (among other Roman artefacts in the Mekong Delta), a site that is one of the suggested locations for the port city of \\"Cattigara\\" along the Magnus Sinus (i.e. Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea) in Ptolemy's Geography.; ; A much earlier Republican-era Roman glass bowl has been unearthed from a Western Han tomb of Guangzhou, along the South China Sea. The Portuguese sent a large subsequent expedition in 1517 to enter port at Guangzhou to trade with the Chinese merchants there. During this expedition the Portuguese attempted to send an inland delegation in the name of Manuel I of Portugal to the court of the Zhengde Emperor. Although Fern√£o Pires de Andrade was able to meet the Zhengde Emperor while the latter was touring Nanjing in May 1520, Pires de Andrade's mission waited in Beijing to meet the Zhengde Emperor once more, but the emperor died in 1521.Mote et al., The Cambridge History of China, 338. The new Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe rejected eunuch influence at court and rejected this new foreign embassy by the Portuguese once Malaccan ambassadors arrived in China damning the Portuguese for deposing their king; the Portuguese diplomatic mission languished in a Chinese prison where they died.Mote et al., The Cambridge History of China, 339. Sim√£o de Andrade, brother to ambassador Fern√£o Pires de Andrade, had also stirred Chinese speculation that the Portuguese were kidnapping Chinese children to cook and eat them; Sim√£o had purchased children as slaves who were later found by Portuguese authorities in Diu, India.Mote et al., The Cambridge History of China, 337‚Äì338. In 1521, Ming dynasty naval forces fought and repulsed Portuguese ships at Tuen Mun, where some of the first breech-loading culverins were introduced to China,Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 369. and again fought off the Portuguese in 1522. Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to Shangchuan Island. In the early 1550s, Leonel de Sousa‚Äîa later Governor of Macau‚Äîreestablished a positive image of Portuguese in the eyes of the Chinese and reopened relations with Ming officials.Mote et al., The Cambridge History of China, 343‚Äì344. The Portuguese friar Gaspar da Cruz (c. 1520 ‚Äì 5 February 1570) traveled to Guangzhou in 1556 and wrote the first book on China and the Ming dynasty that was published in Europe (fifteen days after his death); it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.Association for Asian Studies, 410‚Äì411. In 1557 the Portuguese managed to convince the Ming court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish Macau as a Portuguese trade colony on the coasts of the South China Sea. The Chinese found the Portuguese settlement useful in expelling hostile Japanese sailors, as well as a useful tool to control other aggressive European powers since the Portuguese repelled Dutch invasions of Macau in 1601, 1607, and 1622.Mote et al., The Cambridge History of China, 349‚Äì351. The Dutch had even blockaded Zhangzhou's Moon Harbor in 1623 in order to force local authorities there to allow them to trade, while local Chinese merchants sent urgent petitions to the provincial governor pleading for him to allow the Dutch entry into port.Brook, 208. China defeated the Dutch in the Sino‚ÄìDutch conflicts in 1622‚Äì1624 over the Penghu islands and again defeated the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633. Chinese trade relations with the Dutch began to improve after 1637 and in 1639 the Japanese cut off trade with the Portuguese due to the Shimabara Rebellion, thus impoverishing Macau and leading to its decline as a major port.Mote et al., The Cambridge History of China, 353. Map of Macau Peninsula in 1639, long after the first Portuguese settlement there and in the same year that the city began to decline due to halt of trade shipments from Japan. From China the major exports were silk and porcelain. The Dutch East India Company alone handled the trade of 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682. After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: > In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried > over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver > from Peruvian and Mexican mines, transported via Manila. Chinese merchants > were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as > the Philippines and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial > opportunities.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 211. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan.Spence, 19‚Äì20. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk. However, by 1573‚Äîafter the Spanish established a trading base in Manila‚Äîthe Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.Spence, 20.Brook, 205. Although it is unknown just how much silver flowed from the Philippines to China, it is known that the main port for the Mexican silver trade‚ÄîAcapulco‚Äîshipped between 150,000 and 345,000 kg (4 to 9 million taels) of silver annually from 1597 to 1602. Map of East Asia by the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci in 1602; Ricci (1552‚Äì1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City, taught the Chinese how to construct and play the spinet, translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate Xu Guangqi (1562‚Äì1633) on mathematical work. Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the Spanish Empire. This included sweet potatoes, maize, and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops‚Äîwheat, millet, and rice‚Äîcouldn't grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.Crosby, 198‚Äì201. In the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;Gernet, 136. after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.Crosby, 200. The beginning of relations between the Spanish and Chinese were much warmer than when the Portuguese were first given a reception in China. In the Philippines, the Spanish defeated the fleet of the infamous Chinese pirate Limahong in 1575, an act greatly appreciated by the Ming admiral who had been sent to capture Limahong.Douglas, 13. In fact, the Chinese admiral invited the Spanish to board his vessel and travel back to China, a trip which included two Spanish soldiers and two Christian friars eager to spread the faith. However, the friars returned to the Philippines after it became apparent that their preaching was unwelcome; Matteo Ricci would fare better in his trip of 1582. The Augustinian monk Juan Gonz√°les de Mendoza wrote an influential work on China in 1585, remarking that the Ming dynasty was the best-governed kingdom he was aware of in the known world. Displaying a multitude of items exported from China to the Spanish base at Manila, Brook quotes Antonio de Morga (1559‚Äì1636), president of the audencia of Manila, who precariously mentions porcelain only once, even though at this time it is becoming one of the greatest export items to Europe from China.Brook, 206. From his observation of textiles in the Manila inventory, the Spanish were buying: > ...raw silk in bundles...fine untwisted silk, white and of all > colors...quantities of velvets, some plain and some embroidered in all sorts > of figures, colors, and fashions, with body of gold and embroidered with > gold; woven stuff and brocades, of gold and silver upon silk of various > colors and patterns...damasks, satins, taffetas...Brook, 205. Other goods that Antonio de Morga mentioned included were: > ...musk, benzoin and ivory; many bed ornaments, hangings, coverlets and > tapestries of embroidered velvet...tablecloths, cushions, and carpets; > horse-trappings of the same stuffs, and embroidered with glass beads and > seed-pearls; also pearls and rubies, sapphires and crystals; metal basins, > copper kettles and other copper and cast-iron pots. . .wheat flour, > preserves made of orange, peach, pair, nutmeg and ginger, and other fruits > of China; salt pork and other salt meats; live fowl of good breed and many > fine capons...chestnuts, walnuts...little boxes and writing cases; beds, > tables, chairs, and gilded benches, painted in many figures and patterns. > They bring domestic buffaloes; geese that resemble swans; horses, some mules > and asses; even caged birds, some of which talk, while others sing, and they > make them play innumerable tricks...pepper and other spices.Brook, 205‚Äì206. Decline=Reign of the Wanli Emperor= The financial drain of the Imjin War in Korea against the Japanese was one of the many problems‚Äîfiscal or other‚Äîfacing Ming China during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572‚Äì1620). In the beginning of his reign, the emperor surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs. His Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (in office from 1572 to 1582) built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials.Hucker, 31. However, there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances; officials soon banded together in opposing political factions. Over time, the Wanli Emperor grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers, preferring to stay behind the walls of the Forbidden City and out of his officials' sight.Spence, 16. Officials aggravated the Wanli Emperor about which of his sons should succeed to the throne; he also grew equally disgusted with senior advisors constantly bickering about how to manage the state. There were rising factions at court and across the intellectual sphere of China stemming from the philosophical debate for or against the teaching of Wang Yangming (1472‚Äì1529), the latter of whom rejected some of the orthodox views of Neo-Confucianism.Ebrey et al., East Asia, 281‚Äì283.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 203‚Äì206, 213. Annoyed by all of this, the Wanli Emperor began neglecting his duties, remaining absent from court audiences to discuss politics, lost interest in studying the Confucian Classics, refused to read petitions and other state papers, and stopped filling the recurrent vacancies of vital upper level administrative posts. Scholar-officials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials; any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor.Spence, 17. =The role of eunuchs= Tianqi era teacups, from the Nantoy≈çs≈ç Collection in Japan; the Tianqi Emperor was heavily influenced and largely controlled by the eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568‚Äì1627). It was said that the Hongwu Emperor forbade eunuchs to learn how to read or engage in politics. Whether or not these restrictions were carried out with absolute success in his reign, eunuchs in the Yongle era and after managed huge imperial workshops, commanded armies, and participated in matters of appointment and promotion of officials. The eunuchs developed their own bureaucracy that was organized parallel to but was not subject to the civil service bureaucracy. Not all eunuchs worked inside the palace; Zheng He and Yishiha were admirals. Although there were several dictatorial eunuchs throughout the Ming, such as Wang Zhen, Wang Zhi, and Liu Jin, excessive tyrannical eunuch power did not become evident until the 1590s when the Wanli Emperor increased their rights over the civil bureaucracy and granted them power to collect provincial taxes.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 194‚Äì195.Spence, 17.Hucker, 11. Complaints about eunuchs abusing their powers of taxation, as well as tales of sexual predations and occult practices, surface in popular culture works such as Zhang Yingyu's \\"The Book of Swindles\\" (ca. 1617).\\"A Eunuch Cooks Boys to Make a Tonic of Male Essence,\\" in Zhang Yingyu, \\"The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection,\\" translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 138-141. The eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568‚Äì1627) dominated the court of the Tianqi Emperor (r. 1620‚Äì1627) and had his political rivals tortured to death, mostly the vocal critics from the faction of the \\"Donglin Society\\".Spence, 17‚Äì18. He ordered temples built in his honor throughout the Ming Empire, and built personal palaces created with funds allocated for building the previous emperor's tombs. His friends and family gained important positions without qualifications. Wei also published a historical work lambasting and belitting his political opponents. The instability at court came right as natural calamity, pestilence, rebellion, and foreign invasion came to a peak. Although the Chongzhen Emperor (r. 1627‚Äì1644) had Wei dismissed from court‚Äîwhich led to Wei's suicide shortly after‚Äîthe problem with court eunuchs persisted until the dynasty's collapse less than two decades later. =Economic breakdown= Spring morning in a Han palace, by Qiu Ying (1494‚Äì1552); excessive luxury and decadence were hallmarks of the late Ming period, spurred by the enormous state bullion of incoming silver and private transactions involving silver. During the last years of the Wanli Emperor's reign and those of his two successors, an economic crisis developed that was centered around a sudden widespread lack of the empire's chief medium of exchange: silver. The Protestant powers of the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England staged frequent raids and acts of piracy against the Catholic-based empires of Spain and Portugal in order to weaken their global economic power.Spence, 19. Meanwhile, Philip IV of Spain (r. 1621‚Äì1665) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from Mexico and Peru across the Pacific towards China, in favor of shipping American-mined silver directly from Spain to Manila. In 1639, the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, causing a halt of yet another source of silver coming into China. However, the greatest stunt to the flow of silver came from the Americas, while Japanese silver still came into China in limited amounts.Brook, 208. Some scholars even assert that the price of silver rose in the 17th century due to a falling demand for goods, not declining silver stocks.Brook, 289. These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces. People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it, forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline. In the 1630s, a string of one thousand copper coins was worth an ounce of silver; by 1640 this was reduced to the value of half an ounce; by 1643 it was worth roughly one-third of an ounce. For peasants this was an economic disaster, since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and selling their crops with copper coins.Spence, 20‚Äì21. =Natural disasters= In this early half of the 17th century, famines became common in northern China because of unusual dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season; these were effects of a larger ecological event now known as the Little Ice Age.Spence, 21. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government was starved of resources and could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing a large but unknown number of people.Spence, 22‚Äì24. The famine and drought in late 1620s and 1630s contributed to the rebellions that broke out in Shaanxi led by rebel leader such as Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong. Fall of the dynasty=Rise of the Manchu= Shanhaiguan along the Great Wall, the gate where the Manchus were repeatedly repelled before being finally let through by Wu Sangui in 1644. A remarkable tribal leader named Nurhaci (r. 1616‚Äì1626), starting with just a small tribe, rapidly gained control over all the Manchurian tribes. During the Imjin War he offered to lead his tribes in support of the Ming army. This offer was declined, but he was granted honorific Ming titles for his gesture.Spence, 27. Recognizing the weakness in the Ming authority north of their border, he took control over all of the other unrelated tribes surrounding his homeland. In 1610 he broke relations with the Ming court; in 1618 he demanded the Ming pay tribute to him to redress the seven grievances which he documented and sent to the Ming court. This was, in a very real sense, a declaration of war as the Ming were not about to pay money to the Manchu. Under the brilliant commander Yuan Chonghuan (1584‚Äì1630), the Ming were able to repeatedly fight off the Manchus, notably in 1626 at the Battle of Ningyuan and in 1628. Under Yuan's command the Ming had securely fortified the Shanhai Pass, thus blocking the Manchus from crossing the pass to attack the Liaodong Peninsula. Using European firearms acquired from his cook, he was able to stave off Nurhaci's advances along the Liao River. Although he was named field marshal of all the northeastern forces in 1628, he was executed in 1630 on trumped-up charges of colluding with the Manchus as they staged their raids.Spence, 24‚Äì25. Succeeding generals proved unable to eliminate the Manchu threat. Unable to attack the heart of Ming directly, the Manchu instead bided their time, developing their own artillery and gathering allies. They were able to enlist Ming government officials and generals as their strategic advisors. A large part of the Ming Army deserted to the Manchu banner. In 1632, they had conquered much of Inner Mongolia, resulting in a large scale recruitment of Mongol troops under the Manchu banner and the securing of an additional route into the Ming heartland. Han defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General Li Yongfang after he surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchu in 1618 and a mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and Hongtaiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.ed. Walthall 2008, p. 148.Wakeman 1977, p. 79. Jurchen (Manchu) women married most the Han Chinese defectors in Liaodong.Crossley, 2010, p. 95. Aisin Gioro women were married to the sons of the Han Chinese Generals Sun Sike, Geng Jimao, Shang Kexi, and Wu Sangui.eds. Watson, Ebrey 1991, pp. 179‚Äì180. Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under Shunzhi and marry Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's (Hong Taiji) granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong. Wakeman 1986, p. 1017. By 1636, the Manchu ruler Huang Taiji renamed his dynasty from the \\"Later Jin\\" to Great Qing at Shenyang, which had fallen to the Manchu in 1621 and was made their capital in 1625.Spence, 24.Spence, 28.Chang, 92. Huang Taiji also adopted the Chinese imperial title huangdi instead of khan, took the imperial title Chongde (\\"Revering Virtue\\"), and changed the ethnic name of his people from Jurchen to Manchu.Spence, 31. In 1638 the Manchu defeated and conquered Ming China's traditional ally Korea with an army of 100,000 troops in the Second Manchu invasion of Korea. Shortly after the Koreans renounced their long-held loyalty to the Ming dynasty. =Rebellion, invasion, collapse= The Shunzhi Emperor (1644‚Äì1661), proclaimed the ruler of China on November 8, 1644. A peasant soldier named Li Zicheng (1606‚Äì1644) mutinied with his fellow soldiers in western Shaanxi in the early 1630s after the government failed to ship much-needed supplies there. In 1634 he was captured by a Ming general and released only on the terms that he return to service.Spence, 21‚Äì22. The agreement soon broke down when a local magistrate had thirty-six of his fellow rebels executed; Li's troops retaliated by killing the officials and continued to lead a rebellion based in Rongyang, central Henan province by 1635.Spence, 22. By the 1640s, an ex-soldier and rival to Li‚ÄîZhang Xianzhong (1606‚Äì1647)‚Äîhad created a firm rebel base in Chengdu, Sichuan, while Li's center of power was in Hubei with extended influence over Shaanxi and Henan. In 1640, masses of Chinese peasants who were starving, unable to pay their taxes, and no longer in fear of the frequently defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels. The Chinese military, caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders from the north and huge peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially fell apart. Unpaid, unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng‚Äînow self-styled as the Prince of Shun‚Äîand deserted the capital without much of a fight. Li's forces were allowed into the city when the gates were treacherously opened from within. On 26 May 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng; during the turmoil, the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden right outside the Forbidden City.Spence, 25. Seizing opportunity, the Manchus crossed the Great Wall after the Ming border general Wu Sangui (1612‚Äì1678) opened the gates at Shanhai Pass. This occurred shortly after he learned about the fate of the capital and an army of Li Zicheng marching towards him; weighing his options of alliance, he decided to side with the Manchus.Spence, 32‚Äì33. The Manchu army under the Manchu Prince Dorgon (1612‚Äì1650) and Wu Sangui approached Beijing after the army sent by Li was destroyed at Shanhaiguan; the Prince of Shun's army fled the capital on the fourth of June.Spence, 33. On 6 June the Manchus and Wu entered the capital and proclaimed the young Shunzhi Emperor ruler of China. After being forced out of Xi'an by the Manchus, chased along the Han River to Wuchang, and finally along the northern border of Jiangxi province, Li Zicheng died there in the summer of 1645, thus ending the Shun dynasty. One report says his death was a suicide; another states that he was beaten to death by peasants after he was caught stealing their food. Zhang Xianzhong was killed in January 1647 when one of his own officers, Liu Jinzhong defected to the Qing and pointed Zhang out to a Manchu archer after he fled Chengdu and employed a scorched earth policy., p. 399.Spence, 34‚Äì35. The Qing differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Bannermen were made out of Han Chinese who defected to the Qing up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled up the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75%.Naquin 1987, p. 141.Fairbank, Goldman 2006, p. 2006.Summing up Naquin/Rawski, chapters 1&2 It was this multi-ethnic force in which Manchus were only a minority, which conquered China for the Qing.eds. Watson, Ebrey 1991, p. 175. 17th-century Dutch drawing of Koxinga's soldiers with plate armour. It was Han Chinese Bannermen who were responsible for the successful Qing conquest of China, they made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China after the conquest, stabilizing Qing rule.Spencer 1990, p. 41. Han Bannermen dominated the post of governor-general in the time of the Shunzhi and Kangxi emperors, and also the post of governors, largely excluding ordinary Han civilians from the posts.Spence 1988, pp. 4‚Äì5. The Qing showed that the Manchus valued military skills in propaganda targeted towards the Ming military to get them to defect to the Qing, since the Ming civilian political system discriminated against the military.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 6. The three Liaodong Han Bannermen officers who played a massive role in the conquest of southern China from the Ming were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde and they governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing after their conquests.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 7. Normally the Manchu Bannermen acted as only reserve forces while the Qing foremost used defected Han Chinese troops to fight as the vanguard during the entire conquest of China.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 9. Among the Banners, gunpowder weapons like muskets and artillery were specifically wielded by the Chinese Banners.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 23. To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from Shunzhi allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with.Wang 2004, pp. 215‚Äì216 & 219‚Äì221.Walthall 2008, p. 140‚Äì141. Scattered Ming remnants still existed after 1644, including those of Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) who established the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan (Formosa). Despite the loss of Beijing and the death of the Chongzhen Emperor, Ming power was by no means totally destroyed. Nanjing, Fujian, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Yunnan were all strongholds of Ming resistance. However, there were several pretenders for the Ming throne, and their forces were divided. Each bastion of resistance was individually defeated by the Qing until 1662, when the last southern Ming emperor died, the Yongli Emperor, Zhu Youlang. The last Ming princes to hold out were the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (Êú±ÂºòÊ°ì), son of Zhu Yihai, who stayed with Koxinga's Ming loyalists in the Kingdom of Tungning until 1683. Koxinga's grandson Zheng Keshuang surrendered to the Qing dynasty in 1683 and was rewarded by the Kangxi Emperor with the title \\"Duke of Haicheng\\" (Êµ∑ÊæÑÂÖ¨) and he and his soldiers were inducted into the Eight Banners, The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives.Manthorpe 2008, p. 108. Despite the Ming defeat, smaller loyalist movements continued until the proclamation of the Republic of China. In 1725, the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty bestowed the hereditary title of Marquis on a descendant of the Ming dynasty imperial family, Zhu Zhiliang, who received a salary from the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the Ming tombs, and was also inducted the Chinese Plain White Banner in the Eight Banners. Later the Qianlong Emperor bestowed the title Marquis of Extended Grace posthumously on Zhu Zhuliang in 1750, and the title passed on through twelve generations of Ming descendants until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The last Marquis of Extended Grance was Zhu Yuxun. In 1912, after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, some advocated that a Han be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace.

The game's title refers to the powerful player characters that battle for supremacy over various zones. The game is multiplayer-oriented and competitive in nature, though it also features a single-player mode against CPU commanded characters. A free demo featuring a multi-player option became available on July 30, 2009 with all gameplay modes unlocked. Gameplay There are two distinct types of Demigod: Assassins and Generals. Assassins rely on their varied combat abilities in a direct fight to kill other Demigods. Generals are a hybrid Demigod that create and support their own minions and other Demigods. Demigod launched with eight Demigods available, four for each type of Demigod, and added two additional Demigods after release.Demigodgame.com Development On April 9, 2009, GameStop began selling Demigod before its release date of 14 April. The game's servers were not yet launched thus not allowing preorder customers to have online play as originally intended. The issue was compounded by a cracked version of the game available for illegal download on torrent sites. In response, Stardock activated all pre-orders a day early from the planned release after returning to work on Monday April 13, 2009.Demigodgame.com The game also had technical problems during online play. Players experienced connectivity issues until June when a patch was released.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Gaming website 1UP.com summarized much of the negative and angered criticism the game received with the following quote: \\"If you're interested in throwing down cash for a beta and maybe getting in some practice before things get smoothed out, go ahead and bump that score up a letter grade. Anybody else should find something else to do until then.\\" GameSpot reviewed the game with a rating of 6.5/10, noting major online connectivity problems and the lack of tutorial or story based campaign as major problems. IGN Jason Ocampo gave the game a 7.5/10 citing bad multiplayer netcoding and stating \\"you'd best wait a while for the developers to get things working before you dive into Demigod\\"  References External links * Category:2009 video games Category:Games for Windows certified games Category:Lua (programming language)-scripted video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online battle arena games Category:Stardock games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Demigod (video game)"},{"id":"15040482","text":"Gmina Przytu≈Çy is a rural gmina (administrative district) in ≈Åom≈ºa County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

Main characters=Cadet/Off./Sgt. Carey Mahoney= Played by: Steve Guttenberg Cadet/Officer Mahoney is the lead character of the first four movies and the cartoon of the series. He is a troublemaking, womanizing cad with a heart of gold. His worst habit is retaliating against insults in bizarrely effective ways. For instance, the last straw before his police career was when he was a parking-lot attendant and was forced to park a car for an abusive customer in a full parking lot; he put the car into a side- wheelie, crashed it between two cars and proudly proclaimed, \\"It fits!\\". Since his father was a decorated police officer, Mahoney was given the choice of the police academy or jail by his father's former boss, Captain Reed, who did not want Mahoney's antics to reflect poorly on his father. He is best known for protecting Commandant Lassard and playing practical jokes on Capt Harris, Mauser, Proctor, Blankes and Copeland, as the five men view Mahoney to be unworthy of being a police officer due to his carefree attitude about life. Despite his womanizing and his habit of breaking the rules, Mahoney is portrayed as being a good and courageous person willing to help those in need, regardless of the consequences. The fact that he graduates with a decoration for bravery speaks to that personal valor. By the third movie, Mahoney's dedication and love for his job as a police officer comes out, as he continually stands up for his cadets, and even gives a speech highlighting how important the cadets are to the Academy and to his peers which inspires the cadets to work harder and achieve their potential. In 4, Mahoney successfully lobbies to have two skateboarders, Arnie and Kyle, placed in the Citizens on Patrol program as an alternative to jail time, reminiscent of how Mahoney himself started in the Academy and had his life turn around for the better. Mahoney is in the animated series, almost every time along with his partner Jones (when in action). He is absent from the last three films, a change that is unexplained. According to the producers, he was originally in the script for the fifth film, but Guttenberg declined the part, and so the character of Nick Lassard was created to fill-in. =Cadet/Off./Sgt./Lt./Capt. Moses Hightower= Played by: Bubba Smith Featured in all but the seventh film, Hightower was a florist before joining the academy. He is best known for his immense stature and superhuman strength. Hightower practices for his driving test by ripping the front seat out of a compact car (a 1977 Honda Civic owned by Copeland) and steering comfortably from the back seat. However, he is the most humble and soft-spoken of all the characters. Despite his gigantic size, Hightower has sometimes admitted that he lacks self-confidence, such as when he tells Mahoney that he has not driven a car since he was twelve years old, and fears that he will bilge out of the police academy if he flunks the driving test. His character often breaks things or uses force to threaten the bad guys. Other examples of him using his strength were when he lifted up the practice squad car with Copeland inside, who had insulted his friend Hooks by calling her a \\"dumb fat jiggaboo\\". He can also drop easily into good-cop mode, to gain the trust of crooks he is about to arrest. However, he too graduated from the academy with a decoration for bravery, and eventually made lieutenant after wrestling an alligator, a skill he learned growing up in the bayou, in order to save Harris' life. Hightower also uses German Shepherd police dogs in the 3rd and 4th films, suggesting he got certified as a dog handler. In the sixth movie, in pursuit of the Wilson Heights Gang, the only time he actually acknowledges himself being angry is when he is almost injured by the largest of the Wilson Heights Gang criminals. When he gets up after having construction-zone items fall on him, Hightower notices that his name pin was displaced and says to himself, \\"Now I'm mad.\\" Hightower is also in the series, along with Laverne Hooks. When last seen in the live-action series episode \\"Dr. Hightower\\", he has been promoted to the rank of captain, and is presented with the \\"Alumnus of the Year\\" award. =Cadet/Off./Sgt./Capt. Eugene Tackleberry= Played by: David Graf Eugene Tackleberry in Stockholm Tackleberry is in all seven films and is best known for his love of firearms, the military and direct action. He had been a veteran of the US military and a security guard prior to joining the police academy. He joined the police force to see more action but has a poor grasp of the difference between the military and civilian life. This paramilitary lifestyle was instilled into Tackleberry from home; in the first film, he mentions that his (signature) firearm was given to him by his mother (Harris: \\"Son, where did you get that gun?\\" Tackleberry: \\"My Mom gave it to me.\\"); in the 4th instalment, Tackleberry comments that weapons-loving senior citizen, Mrs. Lois Feldman, reminded him of his mother (hinting that his mother may already be dearly-departed by this point). Tackleberry is a bit trigger-happy; a tendency which would have had him court-martialed long ago had it not been for the fact that he actually has good aim. Tackleberry was also known for getting the job done, but with overkill and naivete; example being aiding a little old lady who lost her money in a pay phone by shooting it and making a bunch of money fall in his hands, \\"Can you identify your quarter, Ma'am\\". Tackleberry also plays the Saxophone, very well. In the second film, which he was assigned to work as a motorcycle policeman, it is revealed that, although Tackleberry exerts an image of toughness and masculinity, he was still a virgin at the age of 28-years-old. However, upon meeting his police partner, a beautiful and equally gun-obsessed woman, Sgt. Kathleen Kirkland (played by Colleen Camp), he falls in love with her. They get married, (driving off in a Bigfoot truck after their wedding), and have a son, Eugene Tackleberry Jr., (featured in the sixth film, played by Daniel Ben Wilson), who is every bit as enthusiastic about all of the same things as his parents. This leads to a series of gags involving the Kirkland family, featuring Eugene's father-in-law and brother- in-law, whose jibes and admonishments are usually punctuated by a good- natured-yet-brutal punch to the jaw; meanwhile, mother and daughter both see the sadistic horseplay as all in good fun. Tackleberry always carries the biggest side arm he can lay his hands on, usually a .44 Magnum, (his signature sidearm), and has a predilection for using excessively heavy equipment (like a chainsaw for cutting down a tree which a truant boy had fled onto); in the sixth movie, posing undercover as a taxi driver, he scares off a patron trying to hire his cab by brandishing a grenade. He uses military slang such as \\"affirmative\\" and \\"negative\\", and the military time system. His personal catchphrase is: \\"...NOW, Mister!\\" to scare people. In the fifth movie, he went so far as to wade into the ocean off Miami, draw his gun on an invading shark, and order, \\"Desist, and leave the swimming area NOW, Mister!\\". He is happiest weighing the benefits of penetration vs. stopping power. Tackleberry is at heart a benevolent person with a tough exterior. He wants to bury his heavy equipment in anyone he encounters; although he did get selfish when he was allowed to test out certain new firearms at the Annual Police Display in Miami, not wanting to share the guns with other officers. He only gave them up when Callahan coaxed him into handing them over, promising Tackleberry that she would \\"get some of his very own, just as soon as they get home.\\" In the animated series he used the bazooka, and is seen with Callahan. Tackleberry's bazooka was often used for comic violence rather than destruction, an example being on an undercover job as an ice cream salesman, then loading the ice cream into his bazooka to cover the escaping crooks in a mess. In the \\"Team Tack\\" episode of Police Academy: The Series, Tackleberry was a captain, and mentions his wife Kathleen was one as well. Jones and Tackleberry are the only characters to appear in all of the movies, the animated series and the television series. Also, he is the very first character seen in the first Police Academy film. In the live-action TV series, Tackleberry has 2 nephews, Cadets Dirk & Dean Tackleberry, who idolize him as their role model. =Cadet/Off./Sgt. Larvell Jones= Played by: Michael Winslow Jones was one of the key characters in the series and is famous for making sound effects with his voice. He is one of the characters often remembered from the films, as he uses his vocal ability to make noises to play pranks and deceive both criminals and authority figures. Jones met Mahoney when they were both arrested by cops. Mahoney pulls some strings with Captain Reid to bring Jones with him to the academy. Jones can imitate sounds such as a flat tire, a couple noisily eating fast food, gunfire, and, memorably, a badly-dubbed martial arts star. Jones has expertise in martial arts, which he continues to use throughout the series to great success, often mimicking kung fu voice- over, as he does so. Other times he uses his sound-effects ability solely to amuse himself, such as one time at the academy when he imagines himself playing a game of Space Invaders and makes all the known sound effects from that video game. In the sixth movie, he leapt onstage at a nightclub during a blackout (in uniform, declaring, \\"The Metropolitan Police Department proudly presents... me.\\"), and launched into a string of impressions, thus keeping the audience from rioting. He also has an ability to communicate with parrots, training them to call Captain Harris a \\"dork.\\" Jones and Tackleberry are the only characters to appear in all of the movies, the animated series and the television series. The character's vocal ability was an added trait by his actor Michael Winslow, who can make sounds and noises with his voice and mouth in real life. In the animated series he was partners with Mahoney and in the live action series where he usually visits the academy and help the new cadets out. =Cadet/Off. Carl Sweetchuck= Played by: Tim Kazurinsky Sweetchuck first appeared in the second film, as a shop owner terrorized by Zed and his gang. In the third film, Sweetchuck decides to join the police force; unfortunately, his former tormentor Zed joins at the same time and in the same class, and the two become mismatched roommates. A stereotypical nerd, Sweetchuck's diminutive size and geeky appearance provided many gags, usually in relation to his physical weakness or as a foil for fellow recruit Zed. After just a few days, Sweetchuck was unable to take any more of Zed's antics and attempted to leave the academy, but was convinced by Tackleberry to stay. He and Zed eventually got along better as time went on, though Sweetchuck still gets mad at Zed for one thing or the other. Sweetchuck is in the animated series (along with Zed). He has a brother named Doug. He also becomes Zed's partner in the animated series. Storefront windows in the first and second film bear the name \\"Sweedchuk\\" and \\"Schewchuk\\" respectively. Sweetchuck's name is based on that of Police Academy set decorator Steve Shewchuk. =Cadet/Off. Zed McGlunk= Played by: Bobcat Goldthwait In the second film, Zed was portrayed as a hyperactive, antisocial gang leader with odd mannerisms, appearance, and taste, but a basically good heart. Many gags are based around Zed's fondness for things that contrast with his wild-man image, such as Family Affair (actually crying at dramatic moments) and Mickey Mouse watches. Another example of his sophomoric behavior was reciting the playground rhyme \\"Gene, Gene, made a machine\\" at a formal poetry reading. Zed is almost like a child, admonishing his cronies to \\"act their age\\" while they trash a supermarket and thanking the cashier for the \\"great bargains\\" (as his gang trundle shopping carts full of food out of the store). When his gang disrupts an anti-crime street fair sponsored by the Mayor, he tells her, \\"I voted for you!\\" Zed is arrested at the end of the second film. In the third film, a reformed Zed (who explains his change of heart by saying, \\"I used to be a real jerk! But now I'm a people guy!\\") joins the police force. He often brings trouble to Sweetchuck, who was the subject of harassment during their civilian years. They become roommates while they are both training at the Police Academy, and they manage to get along (to an extent) with each other and in time become friends. Zed suffers from an inability to speak properly and often squeaks or swallows his words. It is also discovered he is immune to the effects of teargas, and apparently even enjoys it. His bad breath and screaming, potent enough to blow down a door, are far more potent weapons than any firearm. He falls in love in the fourth film with Laura, one of the Citizens on Patrol. Zed is in the animated series (along with Sweetchuck). Several family members make guest appearances: Auntie Bertha, the cousins Ed and Ned, and his hillbilly parents. His surname is McGlunk. In the second film Zed mentions his mother's name was Jughead after Mahoney (undercover) calls himself \\"Jughead\\" and says he belongs to a gang called the Archies. =Cadet/Off. Thomas \\"House\\" Conklin= Played by: Tab Thacker Conklin appeared in movies 4 and 5. He joined the academy first under the COP program in the fourth film, and later became a full-time cop at the start of the fifth film. He is tremendously overweight due to his love of food, and this at times is used as a source of jokes: on the flight to Miami, House changes seats and the plane begins to tilt. When he was a child, Hightower would babysit him and bounce him on his knee: but even the immensely strong Hightower could not recognize the giant House as the same child he once effortlessly lifted. Like Hightower, he is strong, but is not as focused upon it like Hightower. Conklin appears in the animated series, and he often has Zed and Sweetchuck as his partners. Other times he works with Hooks and Hightower, such as a beach assignment where they go undercover as a civilian family, with House playing the \\"son\\" and Hooks and Hightower as the \\"mom\\" and \\"dad\\". =Cadet/Off./Sgt. Laverne Hooks= Played by: Marion Ramsey Hooks is a diminutive, soft-spoken and unassertive woman with a very high-pitched voice, who often has trouble putting people in line. However, she is known for becoming aggressive and authoritative when frustrated or otherwise pushed to her limit, punching people out or pulling her service weapon, screeching the memorable phrase: \\"Don't move, dirtbag!\\" The word \\"dirtbag\\" is possibly something she inherited from her days in the Police Academy, under the training of then-Lieutenant Harris. In the third movie, Hooks became more confident in herself and is assertive in keeping people in line. She was the first one who quickly figured out that her former classmates, Blankes and Copeland are working with Mauser to shut down the Metropolitan Police Academy to humiliate Lassard, but kept it to herself. When they found out too late that Hooks knew the truth, she knocked Blankes and Copeland out and told Cadet Fackler (Debralee Scott) to inform Mahoney of the situation with the governor. In the fifth film, Hooks is also revealed to be a talented artist, employing this skill as a police sketch artist. In the 6th film, she proves her assertiveness by calling out the attorney for his infractions, including ignoring an officer of the law, tearing up a court summons and parking in a handicapped spot. Hooks proves her point by having his car towed to the impound lot and told the attorney he can have his car back as soon as he paid back the city for his infractions. She appears in the first six films of the franchise and in the animated series. She is seen working with Hightower in the 5th and the 6th films and in the animated series. =Sgt./Lt./Capt./D.A. Debbie Callahan= Played by: Leslie Easterbrook This character is best known for her pure sex appeal, specifically her large breasts, which provided the series with countless sight gags, and penchant for wearing tight fitting clothing. A more serious, grown-up, mature version of Tackleberry, Callahan is portrayed as a stoic, no-nonsense officer who is both physically and sexually aggressive. She along with Harris trained the cadets in the first film, but she does not show the outright hostility towards the cadets that Harris does. In her role as a teacher to the cadets, she usually gets into situations where after explaining or demonstrating the lesson, she is usually flanked by the male cadets volunteering to be her next test-subject. For example, in the first movie, where she demonstrates self- defense: Leslie Barbara is her test subject, whom she swiftly takes down and sits on his face. When she asks for volunteers, all the male cadets promptly and eagerly volunteer. Another example is in the fourth movie, she teaches a lesson about saving drowning victims, in which she plays the drowning victim: After she dives in the pool, swims to the middle, and surfaces with her breasts showing through her white T-shirt, she asks: \\"Now, who's going to save me?\\" Immediately, all the male cadets jump into the pool and swim after her, while she frantically swims away. She is an avid weightlifter and also knows martial arts and has a good singing voice. In the first film, she has a relationship with Cadet Martin; in the third and fourth film, she has a relationship with Japanese foreign-exchange cadet, Nogata. She is seen partnered with Tackleberry in the 4th and the 5th films, (keeping him and his gun obsession in line), and in the animated series. She appears in every film except the second, and is promoted to lieutenant and then captain. In the Police Academy: The Series episode \\"Dead Man Talking\\", Callahan has retired from the Police Force and has been elected District Attorney. =Sgt. Nick Lassard= Played by: Matt McCoy Nephew of Eric Lassard (and possibly the son of Capt. Pete Lassard), he appears in the fifth and sixth films. Nick is an officer in the Miami police department in the fifth film where he assumes the role of lead prankster and womanizer, the role held by Mahoney in the previous films. Again assuming this role in the sixth film, he is also portrayed as a skilled gymnast: at the end of Police Academy 6 he escapes injury by swinging on an overpass and landing in a speeding Bigfoot. When the Mastermind took the form of Commissioner Hurst, only Nick wasn't fooled by this and is able to point out the real Hurst from the fake with a Pinocchio test. Mahoney and Nick's characters are very similar, as much as Harris and Mauser, although Lassard shows some more professionalism in his duties, likely respectful of the Lassard family name in law enforcement. =Cmndt. Eric Lassard= Played by: George Gaynes Eric Lassard is Commandant, or head, of the Metropolitan Police Academy (sometimes also called the Midcity Police Academy). He is initially not into the politics of the police department. When Chief Hurst and Lieutenant Harris are denouncing the new female mayor's policy change to remove the barriers from academy admissions, he plays along with them and quickly dismisses their comments once they've left the room. A few years later, however, he will initiate a program known as Citizens on Patrol (COP), which is a community outreach course. Lassard featured in all seven films. He is often portrayed as benevolent yet clueless, fond of his pet goldfish and of making long-winded, optimistic speeches about the future of the academy. =Lt./Capt./Cmndt. Thaddeus Harris= Thaddeus Harris Played by: G.W. Bailey \\"Mister Nasty\\" of the police academy, he always attempts to discredit Lassard and his men, but ends up being the butt of most of the jokes. Starting with Police Academy 4, he inherits Proctor from Mauser. He generally seems to be success-driven, at the cost of Lassard and his men. Started as lieutenant in the first film but is promoted to captain in other films to come. His catchphrase is: \\"Move it! Move it! Move it!\\" He is also deathly afraid of heights, as evidenced in an undercover stakeout in the sixth film, in which his and Proctor's covers are window washers for a high-rise office tower. He derives pleasure from tormenting and belittling his subordinates - first the cadets he instructs at the academy, then Lassard's men whom he outranks. Although he is generally disliked by his colleagues because of his treatment of them, those same people end up rescuing him. Despite his role as antagonist, some scenes display Harris's genuine desire to see graduates become good cops. His initial dislike of Mahoney is based in part on his belief that he is disrupting the development of people, \\"who might make pretty good police officers\\". He heavily favors Blankes and Copeland and recruits them as squad leaders. An example of this is inn the first film, where, after Harris asks Blankes and Copeland to keep an eye on Mahoney, they ask Mahoney where they are going to get together later on, to which Mahoney tells them, and it ends up being a gay nightclub. Later, in the seventh movie, Harris and the rest of the team develop a 'peace' of sorts, with Harris joining them in the rescue attempt of Callahan and providing the team with the necessary equipment to track the criminals. He even demonstrates trust in Tackleberry by requesting he be the one to shoot a locator bullet into the bad guy's car, notably calling him by his nickname \\"Tack\\" when doing so. He works with Proctor in the fourth, fifth, and sixth films and the animated series. In the animated series Captain Harris is portrayed as gruff but not as sadistic as he was in the movies, and generally more competent. He also seems to take out his dislike of Mahoney through red tape rather than direct action. When Captain Harris was tasked with investigating a string of crimes at the beach, he is also responsible for getting all the officers undercover assignments, to which Mahoney and Jones are assigned to be sanitation workers picking up litter. While Jones accepts his assignment, Mahoney complains that Harris gave them this work to express his dislike of them. A reformed Mauser defends Mahoney and confronts Harris for his actions. He then belittles Harris for taking out his anger on his former cadets out of convenience, rather than disciplinary purposes. In the animated series episode Police Academy Blues, Harris finally achieves his long-awaited dream of becoming commandant when Lassard is forced to step down, due to the Professor's Supercar being stolen under Lassard's watch. However, Commandant Harris's crowning moment is short-lived, as Mahoney and crew track down and capture the Supercar robbers, ensuring Lassard's reinstatement as commandant, and Harris's demotion to the rank of captain once again. =Sgt./Lt./Capt./Acting Capt. Carl Proctor= Played by: Lance Kinsey Carl Proctor Lt. Carl Proctorhttp://geddes.net/sites/default/files/resume_107.pdf is a gullible sidekick to Mauser in Police Academy 2 and 3 and Harris in 4, 5 and 6. In his debut in the second movie, he is originally assertive and staunchly supports Mauser but is also a dimwit and in subsequent appearances portrayed even more so. He even disliked Mahoney and his friends and makes Harris or Mauser dis- credit them. That is why he was part of butt of Mahoney and his friends pranks on him. In 3, is the second-in-command of Mauser's police academy. Despite losing his job after Mauser's academy is shut down, he gets another job as Captain Harris' underling. Proctor seems to bear the brunt of some of the biggest pranks, such as being lifted by crane while he is inside an outhouse and placed onto the field of a sporting stadium. When Proctor hears the national anthem, he stands up immediately and shocks everyone in the audience. He is generally nicer than Harris or Mauser and is often just following orders, which he mostly manages to screw up. But that is just an act, just like Harris they both think Lassard's men are a joke and mostly he is usually Harris spy to dis-credit them and throw them off the force. Another aspect of Proctor is his childlike attitude in some adult situations, like when he thought the Blue Oyster Bar was a seafood joint or saying to a bartender, \\"Could I get a pink -- no make it a green -- umbrella?\\" before he introduces himself to a couple of bathing beauties in Florida. Although Proctor has been subject to pranks and slapstick stunts, unlike Harris, he does not appear to show a vicious attitude towards Mahoney and his friends, either because he is too stupid to realize Mahoney was behind the pranks or he is very forgiving. In Police Academy 5, it is revealed that he and Harris are related through the marriage of Proctor's sister and Harris' nephew. He also appears along with Harris in the animated series, in which Proctor is temporarily promoted to Acting Captain in one episode, due to Harris being hospitalized. =Lt./Capt./Cmndt./Sheriff Ernie Mauser= Played by: Art Metrano Mauser (or Meiser in the series; Bouser in the animated series) is a similar character to Harris, and his role in the movies is essentially the same. Playing a ruthless and demeaning, success-driven officer, Mauser is often the butt of many of the jokes played by Lassard's men. His lackey is Proctor. He appears in Police Academy 2 and 3. In Police Academy 2, he tricks his way into becoming Captain of the Precinct. In the end of the movie, he was demoted back to lieutenant and Pete Lassard was back as captain, since Pete, Mahoney and his friends finally put away Zed's vicious gang behind bars and Pete was reinstated as captain. In Police Academy 3, he is the Commandant of the rival police academy and took advantage of Blankes and Copeland's desire to seek revenge on Lassard for graduating at the bottom of their class. His police academy is eventually dismantled by the state government as his cadets prove to be far less responsive to actual emergencies than Lassard's men. However, in the animated series, Mauser becomes a good character and is head of the K9 Corps. His attitude towards Mahoney and the others improves drastically. Mauser's attitude towards Harris is similar to Hurst's (in the later films), in that he points out his flaws and belittles Harris for his behavior. Due to Art Metrano's accident in 1989 that left him partially paralyzed, Mauser, now a wheelchair-bound County Sheriff, makes his final appearance in the 1997 live- action series episode \\"Hoop Nightmares\\". In this episode, it is revealed that Mauser was once a good friend of Eric Lassard's successor, Stuart Hefilfinger, but Mauser apparently harbours some resentment towards Stuart for getting the position of Academy Commandant that Mauser wanted. This episode also finally answers the question of Mauser's first name - Ernie. Supporting characters=Cadet Leslie Barbara= Played by: Donovan Scott Leslie Barbara is an overweight guy that could not stand up for himself, and happens to have two girl names. For this he is constantly the victim of extreme practical jokes by a group of bullies who drive an old Mack Teskey truck. In the first part of the first film, he and the photo hut in which he works (which is in the shape of camera) are thrown off a bridge into a river. He declares revenge as he is joining the police academy. He has a dog named Princess, who was seen earlier humping Lassard's leg (due to her not being spayed) and causing the then Lt. Harris to confiscate the dog. However, at the academy, Barbara is still subject to some intimidation, mainly from Blankes and Copeland, who try to force Barbara into revealing that Mahoney is hosting a party without authorization. Mahoney senses he's being set up by both Blankes and Copeland and falsely tells him the party is at the Blue Oyster Bar. While at the academy, Barbara eventually learns how to stand up for himself and develops self-defense skills. This comes in handy twice. The first time was against two of his tormenters, Blankes and Copeland. Having enough of their misconduct towards Mahoney by taunting him into fighting them so they can give Harris a reason to expel him, Barbara stands up for him. He takes them by surprise in throwing the first punch by hitting Copeland in the face with a metal lunch tray. After he faints, Blankes got offended and punched Barbara in the face for foiling them, resulting in a fight between Blankes and Mahoney. The second time was during the city riot at the end of the film when he finally faces the bullies who tormented him before becoming a cop, who taunts him again and prepare to attack Barbara. However, he is able to fend them off and put them on their backs. After the fight, Barbara demands the gang return the furniture from the truck back into the house from which they were taking it from and leave. The ringleader soon tells him that the furniture is theirs and were actually moving away from town because of the riot. Barbara mutters, \\"Oh, sorry\\", leaves looking a little guilty, but then smiles, with a \\"sweet revenge\\" look in his eyes. He is last seen comforting Tackleberry for missing the action. =Cadet/Sgt. Kyle Blanks= Played by: Brant von Hoffman Along with Copeland, he is often the comic foil for Mahoney and the other officers. He only appears in the first and third films. He and Copeland are Harris' favorites and he designated them as squad leaders. It was implied that Blanks was also intimidated by Hightower and is seen walking away whistling as the more fearful Copeland got inside the squad car. Just like Proctor, he was Harris and Mauser spies and want to make sure they do whatever it takes to get rid of Lassard's men off the force and dis-credit them. Like Copeland, Blanks was tricked into going to the Blue Oyster Bar by Mahoney in order to keep them away from the party at the beach. He would wind up there a 2nd time by accident when he and Copeland were trying to avoid rioters after a dangerous thug stole their revolvers. Blanks and Copeland willingly helped Mauser to humiliate Lassard's academy as an attempt at revenge because they graduated at the bottom of their class. One of their schemes was to embarrass Hooks, who was on duty as dispatcher, to sabotage her GPS by turning it into a game of Paperboy. However, Hooks was no fool and she caught on to their scheme quickly. Realizing too late she pretended to be fooled, both Blanks and Copeland were knocked out with one double-punch by Hooks. =Cadet Kyle Connors= Played by: Charlie Schlatter A cadet whose acrophobia is well known, Kyle Connors only appears in Mission to Moscow. Due to not coming top in his class and failing in his training due to his acrophobia (despite his aspiration to follow in his father and grandfather's footsteps as a Police Officer), he cheated his way into Commandant Lassard's team when he learned it would be heading to Russia. He seems to have been intended as a replacement for Carey Mahoney and Nick Lassard as the lead womanizer, in spite of being somewhat younger than his predecessors. He does have excellent computer skills. =Cadet/Sgt. Chad Copeland= Played by: Scott Thomson Chad Copeland starts out as a cadet in the first film, and in his subsequent appearances moves further up the ranks. Upon meeting Hightower the first time at the academy, Copeland immediately is intimidated by him after an earlier (albeit racist) comment he made with Blankes. Initially chosen with Blankes as a cadet leader for Harris' team at the Academy to spy on Mahoney and his friends to get them off the force and dis-credit them. Copeland is portrayed as a bigot several times in the first movie. He makes a racial insult at Hooks for accidentally running over his feet by calling her \\"a dumb, fat jigaboo\\". His intimidation for Hightower grew when he comes down the steps offended by the racial insult enough to flip the car over with Copeland inside(despite Harris and Hooks' pleas to stop). He stays on with the Metropolitan Police, and (with Blankes again) attempts to sabotage Lassard's academy under the guidance of Commandant Mauser. Surprisingly, even though his antics of sabotage were found out by Sgt. Hooks and Cadet Fackler, he is still kept on the force. His attitude on the police beat is that of being overly strict, and tends to antagonize people akin to Captain Harris' attitude. Just like Proctor, he was Harris and Mauser spies and want to make sure they do whatever it takes to get rid of Lassard's men off the force and dis-credit them. He is often fooled into walking into the gay bar, The Blue Oyster. He appears in the first, third and fourth films, and makes a guest appearance in the animated series, as Proctor's assistant in the episode \\"Proctor, Call A Doctor\\", and makes a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Grads On Tour\\". Like Harris and Mauser, Copeland has also shown contempt for Mahoney, evident when he takes an off-beat approach to handle situations. Near the end of the first movie, Barbara took everyone by surprise and threw the first punch by hitting Copeland in the face with a lunch tray. He is bewildered and confused by Barbara's actions for a few seconds, before fainting. =Cadet/Off./Sgt. Douglas Fackler= Played by: Bruce Mahler Bespectacled, mild-mannered and accident-prone police officer, who unknowingly causes injury and havoc to just about everyone and everything in his path. In the first film, he unknowingly starts a chain reaction of events when he discards an apple which hits a biker, causing the biker to accuse a rival gang member (who is holding a bag of apples) of hitting him, which ignites a fight, then culminates into a riot. He appears in the first, second, third, and sixth movies. He is seen driving a station wagon to register at the police academy in the first film, where his wife, Violet climbs on the hood to discourage him, but he drives with her outside. In a parody of the scene with his wife's reluctance to let him be a policeman, he shows similar opposition to his wife joining the new recruits in the third film, by jumping on the hood of his squad car and riding it from their home to the police academy. He does not appear in the animated series. =Mrs./Cadet Violet Fackler= Played by: Debralee Scott She is the wife of Douglas Fackler and fiercely opposes her husband's plans to join the police force in the first movie, including attempting to stop his car going to the police academy in any way possible, but Douglas becomes a cop anyway. In the third film, Violet decides to join the academy and becomes a cadet, and now her husband tries to stop her from doing this. Like her husband, Violet doesn't appear in the animated series. =Police Chief/Comm./Cmndt. Henry J. Hurst= Played by: George R. Robertson Initially chief of police, Henry Hurst is later promoted to commissioner. Initially, he is opposed to the new rules from the mayor that the Police Academy should be open to all people, regardless of age, sex, physical ability, etc., sharing the same disgust as the then Lt. Harris. He comes up with a plan to make all cadets quit by weeding out those who are over the age, obese, too muscular, etc. and orders both Harris and Lassard (who is against it) to implement them. However, after the initial successes of Lassard's academy graduates, he grows to love and respect them, and goes around to special events to promote Lassard's academy and the Metropolitan Police. He is a fair man, but is usually annoyed by Harris or Mauser's antics and does not like to be taken for a ride. He sometimes appears concerned about Commandant Lassard's behavior. Over the course of the story, he develops from an attitude of intolerance to acceptance and wisdom. Because of his acquired wisdom, he can usually point out people whose actions are phony or genuine: In the case of Capts. Mauser and Harris, he usually points out what their intentions are and belittles them for their actions, mainly because both men like to kiss up to him (more prominent with Mauser, while Harris takes a more antagonistic approach). He does not appear in the animated series, but is substituted by another chief of police. In the live-action series episode, \\"Cadet of the Year\\", budget cuts force Commissioner Hurst to take over as commandant of the Police Academy. =Cadet/Officer Bud Kirkland= Played by: Andrew Paris Bud is Kathleen's younger brother who enjoys boxing and was on the high school championships. He continued boxing with his father, and they are constantly punching each other out. He appears as a high school graduate in the second film, a cadet in the third film, and an officer in the fourth film; here, he is against his father joining the C.O.P. (Citizens On Patrol) program, citing that, with 3 members of the family in the police force, it might look like favouritism if he joined too, albeit still a citizens; his father, however, believes that Bud's reluctance for him to join C.O.P. is because he thinks that his father cannot 'cut it'. Andrew Paris is the real- life son of actor-turned-director Jerry Paris, who directed the second and third films. =Off./Sgt./Lt./Capt. Kathleen Kirkland-Tackleberry= Played by: Colleen Camp Kathleen Tackleberry (n√©e Kirkland) is the female version of Eugene Tackleberry: She is a gun fanatic with authoritarian, militaristic manners. She and Tackleberry first meet in the second film, and she's his new partner in motorcycle duty; they first meet, fall in love, and eventually get married, all in the 2nd film. In the 4th film, they're seen attending dinner with her family. In the 6th film, Police Academy 6: City Under Siege, although she isn't seen, it's revealed that she and Eugene now have a son, Eugene Tackleberry, Jr., who's as weapons-happy as his parents (he has his very-own police baton). In Police Academy: The Series, Tackleberry mentions that he was promoted to captain alongside his wife. =Eugene Tackleberry, Jr.= Played by: Daniel Ben Wilson Eugene Tackleberry Jr. is the son of Eugene Tackleberry Sr. and Kathleen Tackleberry (n√©e Kirkland), and a gun fanatic/weapons-happy as his parents (he has his very-own police baton), just like his parents. He appears only in the sixth film, Police Academy 6: City Under Siege. =Capt. Pete Lassard= Played by: Howard Hesseman Captain Pete Lassard, brother of Cmndt. Eric Lassard (and possibly the father of Sgt. Nick Lassard), appears as the captain of the 16th Precinct from the second film. This precinct is where the new academy graduates are first posted. Like his brother he is very dedicated to his work and genuinely tries to make the city a safer place to live. After budget cuts and having to deal with old and tired squad members he requests aid from his brother and receives six of his best graduates to help out. He's not opposed to going bare-knuckle against hoodlums, but once got trapped and subsequently spray painted and given a new hairdo by Zed's gang. He hasn't carried live ammo since 1973 apparently. =Cadet George Martin= Played by: Andrew Rubin George Martin appears only in the first Police Academy movie. When the movie begins he seems to be a Hispanic heartthrob with a gift for attracting hordes of women. But later in the movie it is revealed that he is fourth generation American of a Spanish-speaking family and actually speaks in an American accent, but plays-up a Spanish accent and changes the pronunciation of his name, (he would pronounce his last name Mar-teen) to get girls. By the end of the first film he would be involved with Callahan. =Cadet/Officer Tomoko Nogata= Played by: Brian Tochi He is a Japanese cadet who features in the third and fourth films. \\"Tomoko\\" is normally a woman's name in Japanese. Initially a member of Mauser's cadets, he is sent to Lassard's academy almost immediately, due to his \\"oddities\\". Once there, he grows attracted to Sgt. Callahan, and the two enter into a relationship. In the fourth movie he appear as an officer of the Japanese police in a congress in London, and later goes with Commandant Lassard to the Academy, where again he gets involved with Callahan. =Officer Vinnie Schtulman= Played by: Peter Van Norden An easygoing, overweight policeman who is always eating, not even minding if a candy bar fell on the ground. Officer Schtulman owns a dog, Lou and a cat, which often accompanies him on duty. Schtulman also seems to think throwing a tennis ball to his dog in a busy traffic tunnel is the same as in open rural areas. He becomes Carey Mahoney's first partner in the second film. =Cadet Karen Thompson= Played by: Kim Cattrall She is a bored socialite who joins the police force to broaden her horizons and meet people \\"who aren't like her and her mother.\\" She tells Mahoney that she wants to be a cop because: \\"I like to dress like a man.\\" She appears only in the first movie. Thompson is best friends with Laverne Hooks and is the only one who understands the soft-spoken woman. She's also Mahoney's first love interest. Antagonists=Unnamed Main Antagonist/Axe Murderer= Played by: Doug Lennox The main antagonist of the first film who was seen in a leather jacket, a T-shirt that says Vassar, beanie and jeans. He was first seen at the end of the open gate, while Blankes and Copeland were busy antagonizing his gang of thugs. Once they got at the end, the man comes out and takes the revolvers out of their hands, forcing Blankes and Copeland on the run from him. The man and his thugs takes Lt. Harris hostage and Mahoney attempts a rescue. It goes awry and the man takes him as a 2nd hostage. He is foiled by Hightower when he fooled him into believing he is a tough thug wanting to help out his fellow criminal. After being knocked out, the man tries to kill Hightower by pulling his own revolver. However, he is easily apprehended by Hooks through a back door to the place Harris and Mahoney are being held hostage. Credited as \\"Axe Murderer\\" in the third film, he is also one of the suspects seen in the police line-up at the 16th Precinct. He is later shown to be the leader of the criminal gang responsible for Governor Neilson's kidnapping at the charity regatta. One of the members of his gang is his mother. He engages the Academy grads in a dramatic boat chase across the harbour, but gets put in his place by Hooks once again. =Mack Teskey Truck Gang= Played by Marco Bianco (ringleader), Ted Hanlan, F. Braun McAsh and Rob Watson The gang who are minor antagonists in the first film, but play a role in it. They first appeared in the Tesla Truck they drive in and bully Leslie Barbara due to him having two feminine names. They take him and the photo hut that is shaped like a camera and throw them overboard. They would meet up near the end of the film. Despite the gang's attempts to intimidate him again, Barbara stands up for himself and fights them off. After putting them on their backs, Barbara demanded that the gang return the furniture back in the apartment and leave. The ringleader reveals it's their furniture and were actually packing their own things to move away from town because of the riots. Barbara briefly apologizes and leaves the men on their backs. =Tony= Played by: Ren√© Auberjonois =Mouse= Played by: Archie Hahn =Sugar= Played by: Jerry Lazarus =Ace= Played by: Gerrit Graham Wilson Heights Gang Member: Ace is an ace when it comes to guns. He is the team's gun specialist opposite to Tackleberry. Ace seems to act like a ladies' man as he seems to acknowledge himself to his female hostages, for example during the bank robbery asking a female \\"where are you from originally?\\" Although skilled he is captured by Tackleberry after they both show skill in firearms. =Flash= Played by: Brian Seeman Flash is the team's martial artist and acrobat and possibly the team's demolitionist, such proof of him using dynamite and a remote bomb in the power plant. He fights Jones in hand-to-hand combat and proves to have equal skill and strength. Although he wins the fight he is defeated by the shock of Jones imitating a cyborg. Stunned due to this fear, he gets knocked out and apprehended by Jones. =Ox= Played by: Darwyn Swalve Ox is the team's muscle and not the most threatening of the team since he takes a calm approach in robberies even asking politely for either the keys or information. Although he is the least dangerous, he was a considerable opponent when he tried to stop Hightower. Due to the amazing strength of both men, they remain for a time in a standoff akin to Indian wrestling until he tells a childish knock-knock joke, to which Hightower replies he draws the line at bad puns and throws Ox to the ground. Hightower then restrains Ox by handcuffing him to a chain link fence, which Ox, despite his strength, does not attempt to break, arguably dismayed over losing the fight. =The Mayor / The Mastermind= Played by: Kenneth Mars The Mayor/Mastermind begins a string of crime waves to devalue a part of town that has a high value due to the businesses on that street. He hires three slightly dimwitted henchmen who have certain traits such as strength and agility. He creates plans for small-time robberies and hides his involvement in it. When he is first introduced as the Mayor, he is furious after the news article detailing the latest robbery done by the Wilson Heights gang. The mayor quickly reprimands Harris for his precinct's slow response and also Hurst for not being strict with the former. Despite trying to argue their case, he points out that because of both Harris and Hurst's slow response, everyone thinks he's incompetent with his job and are leaving town. Under threat by the governor with revocation if he doesn't stop the crime wave and bring the Wilson Heights gang into custody, the Mayor orders them to work with Commandant Lassard and his team to stop the crime wave. As the Mastermind, he detonates a power plant to send the city into chaos. During this time, crime in the blackout intensifies from local hoods to riots. Once discovered, he tries to eliminate Sgt. Lassard in his hideout before escaping. He commandeers a power utility truck equipped with a cherry picker which Lassard hops aboard to pursue Mastermind. During the chase through the darkened streets, Mastermind takes control of the Basket Override and tries to either kill Lassard or knock him off. During the bridge development Mastermind tries once more to kill Lassard by trying to knock his head off with the bridge, but fails due to Lassard's gymnastic skills. Once the chase ends, they head into a building which houses Hurst's office. In this scene, he takes the form of Hurst in order to fool his pursuers. However, Sgt. Lassard isn't fooled and is able to point out the real Hurst from the fake with a Pinocchio test. Once it is discovered that he was the mayor, he confesses to Harris' unwitting involvement as his informant and the billions of dollars he could've made from his scam. The Mayor's title is revoked and he is arrested along with his henchmen. Other characters=Professor= Voiced by: Howard Morris He is a genial scientist. He appears only in the animated series. =Auntie Bertha= She is Zed's aunt. She appears only in the animated series, along with the cousins Ed and Ned. In the episode \\"Little Zed & Big Bertha\\" they are criminals, but in the episode \\"Wheels of Fortune\\" they become cops. =Mr. Wig= Played by: Don Lake A rude and arrogant customer who wears a wig. When he pulls up to the parking lot where Mahoney formerly worked, the parking lot is full and he refuses to take no for an answer. Wig is humiliated when Mahoney screams out that he is wearing a wig, forcing the man to yell at him to be quiet. He and Mahoney's former boss were friends and Mr. Wig took advantage of that. Moments later, Mr. Wig is seen running with the boss to catch Mahoney wrecking his car. Wig only appears in the first movie. =Unnamed Nurse= Played by: Diana Bellamy A sadistic nurse whom was sent to the 16th precinct with two male orderlies to perform a body cavity search. Mahoney directs her to an unaware Lt. Mauser, leading her to order Mahoney and his friends to leave.

He resigned in 1930, refusing an order from the board of directors to support the United Empire Party; his last issue roundly condemned the new party, while the first after his departure wholly endorsed it. Barry and much of the staff set up the rival Week-End Review, which later merged with the New Statesman.\\"Barry, Sir Gerald\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography By the 1930s the Saturday Review was in decline and in 1933 was purchased by the eccentric Lucy, Lady Houston, with the intention of using it to promote her strongly nationalistic views on Britain and the Empire. Lady Houston was a hands-on proprietor who soon took over the editorship herself, despite the fact that she was in her late seventies. Running the paper from her home in Hampstead, or from her luxury yacht, the Liberty, she attacked the politicians whom she thought responsible for the country's weakness - mainly Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, and Anthony Eden. She also took a strong line against the Soviet Union, believing Bolshevik influence to be responsible for many of the ills of the country and British Empire. When Lady Houston died in December 1936 the paper was continued for some months by a group of people who had worked for her. However, she had given it the kiss of death.

It was introduced as a two-door fastback sedan, the first such design in the Japanese market. The series was discontinued in 1971, after the introduction of the company's Galant sedan but without a real replacement. Colt 800 The 800 was powered by a three-cylinder two-stroke engine of 843 cc capacity producing . This made it more powerful than the projected competitor, Toyota's 700 cc Publica. Equipped with a four-speed manual gearbox and weighing a scant 750 kg, top speed was . While it may have looked like a hatchback, the 800 was never available with a rear hatch. However, both a coupe utility version (\\"ute\\" in Australia, where many of these were sold) and a wagon (\\"Van\\" in Japanese parlance) were marketed. The Van was clearly based on the ute, with a horizontally split rear tailgate and workmanlike interior. Mitsubishi gave up on the two-stroke engine in 1968, pushing the new four-stroke Colt 1000F instead. Customers across the world were beginning to steer away from cars with these types of engines and new stricter emissions standards were looming. The similarly sized and-engined Suzuki Fronte 800 was discontinued without replacement around the same time; these were the last Japanese two-strokes bigger than a Kei car. In general, the 700-800 cc class was dying away in Japan at this time, being replaced by 1000 cc cars.  Colt 1000F  In September 1966 the two-stroke 800 engine was complemented by the larger four- stroke 977 cc pushrod powerplant (KE43) from the more traditional Colt 1000. 800 production ended in the last months of 1968, shortly after the introduction of the 1100. The engine in the Colt 1000F, \\"F\\" for \\"Fastback\\" to set it apart from its stodgier sedan counterpart, produced . In August 1967, the 1000F finally received the lifting tailgate that the car's design had always promised. The hatchback also had the added benefit of a larger rear window, as such a design would no longer encroach on the boot opening. There was also a Colt 1000F Van model, with round taillights and the same engine specifications as the sedan. The 1000F remained in production until May 1969, after which only 1.1-liter models were available. File:Mitsubishi- Colt1000F.JPGMitsubishi Colt 1000F File:Mitsubishi- Colt1000Frear.JPGMitsubishi Colt 1000F = Competition = The Colt 1000F became Mitsubishi's first ever rally car. The company which would go on to score multiple World Rally Championships and Dakar Rally wins began with an unexpected class victory, and fourth place overall, in the 1967 Southern Cross Rally in Australia with a 1000F fastback.  Colt 1100F/11-F  Mitsubishi Colt 1100F Sports at the Mitsubishi Motors Museum Colt 1100F three-door, rear view, showing the larger tailglass In August 1968, the Colt F received the engine from the Colt 1100 sedan and became the Colt 1100F. This also marked the introduction of a four-door version with a fastback styled rear but again without a tailgate. This four-door bodywork was only ever available with the 1.1-litre engine. Top speed was while the 400-meter sprint took 19.7 seconds. A , , twin-carb \\"Super Sport\\" version also appeared in October 1968, and was able to go one better than its Colt 1000 sibling: 1100Fs finished third overall (and first and second in class) at the 1968 Southern Cross Rally. In 1968 a Colt 1100F two-door was brought over to the United Kingdom for evaluation, and was also tested by Car Magazine. They praised the revvy engine and the sturdy suspension, but considered the car cramped and said that the ride was bouncy and inclined to pitch. The Colt also had a very quiet engine, with very little road and wind noise. In the end nothing came of it, and Mitsubishi (as the Colt Car Company) stayed out of the UK until 1974. In May 1969 the lineup was revamped and renamed the Colt 11-F (chassis code A82), as the one-litre models were dropped. The 11-F lost the peculiar top-hinged rear side windows, instead getting a single, large piece which opened by swinging out. The grille was also new. The \\"cooking\\" versions (Standard, DeLuxe, Super DeLuxe) came with a version of the pushrod KE44 engine, and was available with all five different bodystyles. The 11-F Super Sports (shortened to 11-F SS in October for the 1970 model year, a version which also gained front disc brakes) received the same 73 hp engine as the previous Super Sports, and was available only in the two-door body. There was also a Sports version, featuring most Super Sports options but with the less powerful engine. Top speed of the SS was , with the 400-meter sprint time being knocked down to 17.7 seconds. The Colt had drum brakes all around, with the fronts being of the twin-leading design. The vans and pickups continued in production and received similar updates as did the sedans, albeit usually a couple of months later. The working vehicles did not have the \\"F\\" in their name, since they were not fastbacks, and were instead called Colt 11-Van and Colt Truck. The price of the updated Colt 11 Van actually dropped by around one percent, while the pickup's price remained stationary.The Motor Monthly (August 1969), p. 121 The commercial models had the same 62 PS engine as did the regular Colts. Production of the Colt 11-F ended in March 1971 (with sales continuing into October) without any true replacement, although the compact Galant FTO can be said to have taken up the Super Sports' mantle. Rallying duties had in any case already been passed to the Colt 1500 Super Sports.

Built from 1963 until 1970, they were available in four bodystyles (2-dr/4-dr sedan, 2-dr van, and 4-dr wagon) and on two different wheelbases, with gradually increasing engine displacements 1000, 1100, 1200, and 1500. After a May 1968 facelift, they were marketed as the \\"New Colt\\". Along with the smaller, fastback Colts they formed the mainstay of Mitsubishi's passenger car lineup in the 1960s. With the late 1969 introduction of the new, larger Colt Galant, the outmoded Colt-series soon faded away, replaced by the Mitsubishi Lancer. The dimensions were kept small so as to provide Japanese buyers the ability to purchase a car that complied with Japanese Government dimension regulations and to keep the annual road tax obligation affordable.

Strapping points were visible in the rearmost side windows. Its top speed is slightly lower, at . In motorsport, Colt 1000-based touring cars took a clean sweep of the podium in their class at the 1964 Japanese Grand Prix, following the successes of the preceding Mitsubishi 500 and Colt 600s. The 1966 model year Colt 1000s, the last year before being replaced by the 1100, received an upgraded engine which later saw service in the smaller, fastback Colt 1000F. Colt (series A21) The Mitsubishi Colt 1100 succeeded the Colt 1000 from September 1966, receiving the A21 chassis code. The 1100 was powered by a four-cylinder pushrod engine of 1,088 cc capacity producing at 6,000 rpm, for a top speed of . Along with trim differences, such as a different grille without a dip in the lower middle part, bumper overriders meant that the 1100 was also longer than its predecessor. Somehow the weight dropped by 40 kilos, to . The 1100 was also available with a floor-mounted shifter, unlike the 1000 and later 1200. Originally available in Standard or DeLuxe trims, a Sporty DeLuxe version joined the lineup soon after its introduction. This also formed the basis for the Colt 1500 SS. The Colt 1100 was replaced by the \\"New Colt\\" 1200 in 1968. There was also an 1100 Van, in Standard or deLuxe form. It offered two-doors and a horizontally split tailgate, and a payload of (or 200 kg with five occupants). At , its body was a little longer, otherwise dimensions were the same.

Mitsubishi Colt 1100 Sedan (with after- market wheels) Colt (series A23) Along with a May 1968 facelift, whereby the Colt became the \\"New Colt\\", the engine was upgraded again: with the long- stroke 1189 cc and KE46 it became the Mitsubishi New Colt 1200, chassis code A23. \\"New Colts\\" are easily recognized by the large rectangular headlights rather than the earlier round ones, along with a lower front grille and more sloping tip of the hood. On the rear, wide slim rectangular taillamps replaced the earlier round ones. All New Colt sedans were built on the longer body of the Colt 1500, which received the same upgrades simultaneously. The price was marginally increased over the previous 1100, while the price of the Colt 1500 remained unchanged. Later on, the engine was upgraded to , which afforded a top speed of . Available as a two-door and four-door sedan, and also as a three-door wagon (\\"Van\\", still with the shorter wheelbase), the Colt 1200 could reach . An extremely rare five-door wagon, more luxuriously equipped than the Van and with entirely different rear bodywork was added somewhat later, and was aimed at private rather than commercial use. A four-speed, full-synchro, column shifted manual was standard, whether in Standard or Custom equipment levels. The Colt 1200 remained available alongside the new Galant for a brief period in late 1969 and early 1970, but not much customer interest remained. Colt 1500 The Mitsubishi Colt 1500 (A25) was a bigger engined version, joining the smaller Colt 1000 in November 1965. The engine was a bored-out, four-cylinder version of the new Debonair's six-cylinder KE64 engine. Unlike its lesser one-liter sibling, the 1500 received four canted headlights and sat on a 65 mm longer wheelbase (). Originally available as a four-door sedan and two-door wagon, it was powered by a 1,498 cc engine producing . The wagon (Colt 1500 Van) had a horizontally divided rear tailgate and used the shorter wheelbase body of the 1100; it was available in either Standard or DeLuxe trim. Equipped with a three-speed column-shifted manual, a four-speed model (Overtop, \\"OT\\") was available on sedans. The fourth gear raised the top speed from . The Van versions, lower geared for more load capacity, could only reach . Later, a now extremely rare four-door wagon aiming for private buyers (unlike the Van commercial vehicle) was added, as for the Colt 1200. This was more comfortably equipped than the Van version, sitting on the longer wheelbase, and with unique rear bodywork. The short- lived wagon was replaced by the all-new Mitsubishi Delica in 1968. Rear view of Colt 1500 (pre-facelift) Echoing the Sporty DeLuxe version of the 1100, the 1500 Sports Sedan appeared in December 1966, discernible by its blacked-out grille and single headlights. Actually, the 1500 SS used the entire shorter and lighter Colt 1100 body (thus weighing in at ) and its floor-mounted shifter. It also received a close ratio four-speed transmission and front disc brakes. Top speed remained unchanged, with the quartermile sprint requiring 19.0 seconds. =New Colt 1500= In May 1968 the 1500 became the New Colt, receiving the same body modifications as described in the Colt 1200 section, including the rectangular headlights. The chassis code became A27. Prices for the Colt 1500 remained unchanged while the 1200 was somewhat pricier than the preceding Colt 1100. New was a two-door sedan bodystyle, unusual in having roll-down rear windows while not having rear doors. The three-speed was discontinued, with all standard models now receiving the 3+OT transmission. Top speeds were 145 km/h for the sedan, 135 km/h for the Van (84 and 90 mph respectively).Mitsubishi New Colt 1500 and Mitsubishi New Colt 1500 Van brochures, nos. 1.1.140.04.27001 and 1.1.140.04.27101. Mitsubishi Motors, 1968. An , twin-SU carbureted \\"Super Sports\\" model was added in August 1968, and was popular in rallying. The Colt 1500 was discontinued in late 1969 upon the introduction of the company's Colt Galant sedan, although the smaller Colt 1200 remained available for a little longer yet. The four-door 1500 Estate Van also remained on sale into 1970, as the new Colt Galant Van had not yet been introduced.‰∏âËè±„ÅÆ‰πóÁî®Ëªä 1970 [Mitsubishi passenger cars], p. 5 See also * Mitsubishi Colt ReferencesExternal links * Colt 1000 Category:Rear- wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:1960s cars ","title":"Mitsubishi Colt 1000"},{"id":"15040542","text":"Gmina Mo≈Ñki is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Mo≈Ñki County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

It was founded in 1918 in Hy≈´ga, in the mountains of Miyazaki Prefecture in Ky≈´sh≈´, but in 1939 they were warned that much of their land was about to be submerged by the construction of a dam, so they searched for a new home and found 10 hectares in Moroyama, Iruma District, Saitama Prefecture. A few members remain at Hy≈´ga to this day, but they are still to a certain extent dependent on the Saitama community and support from \\"external members\\". Mushanok≈çji worked at the village for a while, but later found that he could help it more by working outside and supporting it with the income from his novels, plays and paintings. There has always been a strong artistic bent at the Mura (as distinct from other religious or political communes, or the well-known Israeli kibbutzim) and many well-known artists lived there or supported it externally. Although there is an art gallery which also produces some publications, and various members have at times worked as potters, for much of its existence, most of the community's income has come from agriculture, including battery-hen eggs (and fertilizer produced from their manure), shiitake, rice, organic vegetables, and to a lesser extent green tea, apricots, and bread. There used to be a nursery school. The income earned by activities in the village is pooled, and individual members receive only 'pocket money', but all other needs are met, including housing, food, medical care, and schooling. Members live in their own houses, in 'conventional' family units with private possessions, but most food is eaten in a communal dining area which also has a stage used for occasional plays and concerts. There are monthly meetings to decide any matters affecting the village, and in principle all decisions must be unanimous. Premature rumours of Atarashiki- mura's demise have existed for decades, but it is a fact that the population is ageing and there is a shortage of new entrants, while children born in the village tend to migrate outside, so its future is far from secure. Membership in 2007 was 21 people in 16 households, with approximately 200 external supporters; there were five members in three households at the Hy≈´ga site. By 2016 membership had declined further to 11 residents, many of whom were in their seventies. The surviving members are no longer young/fit enough to continue the egg business, and partly to offset the punitive effects of new tax regulations, large parts of the village land have been covered in solar panels, although the income from this is only guaranteed until around 2020, when the community is likely to face a financial crisis. Ideals The \\"spirit of Atarashiki-mura\\" is summed up in six lines written by Mushanok≈çji and reprinted on the back of each issue of the village's magazine. * Our ideal is that all the world's people should fulfil their own destinies, and that the individuality residing in each one of them should be allowed to grow fully. * One must not therefore allow the promotion of one's own individuality to infringe upon the individuality of others. * Hence one must promote one's own individuality in a correct manner. One must not harm the destiny or just demands of other people merely for the sake of one's own pleasure, happiness or freedom. * We will work so that all the world's people may share our ideals and choose the same style of life, and thereby walk along a path where they are able to fulfil their duties equally, enjoy freedom, lead correct lives and fulfil their destinies (including individuality). * Those who endeavour to live this way, who believe in the possibility of such a way of life and pray or hope fervently that all the world's people may put it into practice, such people are members of Atarashiki-mura and are our brothers and sisters. * We therefore believe that if all people embark upon a correct way of life, or endeavour to do so, and such people truly cooperate with each other, then the world we desire will come to be without struggle between nations nor between classes. We will do our utmost to achieve this goal. right Flag The village has a flag, consisting of four colours (representing the four races) surrounded by blue (representing the world in which they should co-exist peacefully).

Huron (left) and Pierre (right) issued rival maps that claimed each as the best place voters should choose for the new state capital in 1890. Early inhabitants Craven Canyon petroglyphs in the Black Hills. Human beings have lived in what is today South Dakota for at least several thousand years. Early hunters first entered North America at least 17,000 years ago via the Bering land bridge, which existed during the last ice age and connected Siberia with Alaska.Schell, p. 15. Early settlers in what would become South Dakota were nomadic hunter-gatherers, using primitive Stone Age technology to hunt large prehistoric mammals in the area such as mammoths, sloths, and camels. The Paleolithic culture of these people disappeared around 5000 BC, after the extinction of most of their prey species. Between AD 500 and 800, much of eastern South Dakota was inhabited by a people known as the 'Mound Builders'.Schell, p. 16. The Mound Builders were hunters who lived in temporary villages and were named for the low earthen burial mounds they constructed, many of which still exist. Their settlement seems to have been concentrated around the watershed of the Big Sioux River and Big Stone Lake, although other sites have been excavated throughout eastern South Dakota. Either assimilation or warfare led to the demise of the Mound Builders by the year 800. Between 1250 and 1400 an agricultural people, likely the ancestors of the modern Mandan of North Dakota, arrived from the east and settled in the central part of the state. In 1325, what has become known as the Crow Creek Massacre occurred near Chamberlain.Deloria and Neal (eds.), p. 161. An archeological excavation of the site has discovered 486 bodies buried in a mass grave within a type of fortification; many of the skeletal remains show evidence of scalping and decapitation. =Arikara= Karl Bodmer's portrait of an Arikara warrior, early 1840s. The Arikara, also known as the Ree, began arriving from the south in the 16th century.Ronda, p. 44. They spoke a Caddoan language similar to that of the Pawnee, and probably originated in what is now Kansas and Nebraska.Hasselstrom, p. 124. Although they would at times travel to hunt or trade, the Arikara were far less nomadic than many of their neighbors, and lived for the most part in permanent villages.Schell, p. 17. These villages usually consisted of a stockade enclosing a number of circular earthen lodges built on bluffs looking over the rivers. Each village had a semi-autonomous political structure, with the Arikara's various subtribes being connected in a loose alliance. In addition to hunting and growing crops such as corn, beans, pumpkin and other squash,Ronda, p. 46. the Arikara were also skilled traders, and would often serve as intermediaries between tribes to the north and south. It was probably through their trading connections that Spanish horses first reached the region around 1760.Schell, pp. 17‚Äì18.Hasselstrom, p. 125. The Arikara reached the height of their power in the 17th century, and may have included as many as 32 villages. Due both to disease as well as pressure from other tribes,Ronda, p. 45. the number of Arikara villages would decline to only two by the late 18th century, and the Arikara eventually merged entirely with the Mandan to the north.Schell, p. 18. The sister tribe of the Arikaras, the Pawnee, may have also had a small amount of land in the state. Both were Caddoan and were among the only known tribes in the continental U.S. to have committed human sacrifice, via a religious ritual that occurred once a year.Philip Duke, \\"THE MORNING STAR CEREMONY OF THE SKIRI PAWNEE AS DESCRIBED BY ALFRED C. HADDON\\", The Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 34, No. 125 (August 1989), pp. 193-203Weltfish 117 It is said that the U.S. government worked hard to halt this practice before their homelands came to be heavily settled, for fear that the general public might react harshly or refuse to move there. =Cheyenne= The Lakota Oral histories tell of them pushing the Algonquian ancestors of the Cheyenne from the Black Hills regions, south of the Platte River, in the 18th century.Walker, James R. & DeMallie, Raymond J. \\"Lakota Society\\" 1992. Before that, the Cheyenne say that they were, in fact, two tribes, which they call the Tsitsistas & Sutaio \\"Cheyenne, Southern.\\" Oklahoma History Center's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved 3 July 2013. After their defeat, much of their territory was contained to southeast Wyoming & western Nebraska. While they had been able to hold off the Sioux for quite some time, they were heavily damaged by a smallpox outbreak. They are also responsible for introducing the horse to the Lakota. =Gros Ventre= North of the Ioway were an Algonquian nation known as the A'ani, whose territory extended from southern Canada, through western Minnesota & eastern N. Dakota & may have extended as far south as northeast South Dakota.Pritzker 319 Many of the cultural traits among the Sioux that do not exist among other Siouan peoples‚Äîincluding hairdos‚Äîoriginated with the A'ani. One of the first to be driven off by the Sioux, they moved west & north, splitting into the tribes known as the Gros Ventre and the Arapaho. They are not to be confused with the Hidatsa, who were also called Gros Ventre by the French. =Ioway= The Ioway, or Iowa people, also inhabited the region where the modern states of South Dakota, Minnesota & Iowa meet, north of the Missouri River. They also had a sister nation, known as the Otoe who lived south of them. They were Chiwere speaking, a very old variation of Siouan language said to have originated amongst the ancestors of the Ho-Chunk of Wisconsin. They also would have had a fairly similar culture to that of the Dhegihan Sioux tribes of Nebraska & Kansas. =Sioux= By the 17th century, the Sioux, who would later come to dominate much of the state, had settled in what is today central and northern Minnesota.Schell, p. 19. The Sioux spoke a language of the Siouan language family, and were divided into two culture groups ‚Äì the Dakota & Nakota. By the early 18th century the Sioux would begin to move south and then west into the plains. This migration was due to several factors, including greater food availability to the west, as well as the fact that the rival Ojibwe & other related Algonquians had obtained rifles from the French at a time when the Sioux were still using the bow and arrow.Schell, pp. 19‚Äì20.Hasselstrom, p. 126.Lass, p. 43. Other tribes were also displaced during some sort of poorly understood conflict that occurred between Siouan & Algonquian peoples in the early 18th century. Map showing the general locations of the tribes and subtribes of the Sioux by the late 18th century; current reservations are shown in orange. In moving west into the prairies, the lifestyle of the Sioux would be greatly altered, coming to resemble that of a nomadic northern plains tribe much more so than a largely settled eastern woodlands one.Schell, p. 22.Lass, p. 45. Characteristics of this transformation include a greater dependence on the bison for food, a heavier reliance on the horse for transportation, and the adoption of the tipi for habitation, a dwelling more suited to the frequent movements of a nomadic people than their earlier semi-permanent lodges. Once on the plains, a schism caused the two subgroups of the Sioux to divide into three separate nations‚Äîthe Lakota, who migrated south, the Asiniboine who migrated back east to Minnesota & the remaining Sioux. It appears to be around this time that the Dakota people became more prominent over the Nakota & the entirety of the people came to call themselves as such. The Lakota, who crossed the Missouri around 1760 and reached the Black Hills by 1776, would come to settle largely in western South Dakota, northwestern Nebraska, and southwestern North Dakota.Schell, pp. 20‚Äì21.Lass, p. 40. The Yankton primarily settled in southeastern South Dakota, the Yanktonnais settled in northeastern South Dakota and southeastern North Dakota, and the Santee settled primarily in central and southern Minnesota. Due in large part to the Sioux migrations, a number of tribes would be driven from the area. The tribes in and around the Black Hills, most notably the Cheyenne, would be pushed to the west, the Arikara would move further north along the Missouri, and the Omaha would be driven out of southeastern South Dakota and into northeastern Nebraska.Hasselstrom, p. 127. Later, the Lakota & Assiniboine returned to the fold, forming a single confederacy known as the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven council fire. This was divided into four cultural groups‚Äîthe Lakota, Dakota, Nakota & Nagoda-- & seven distinct tribes, each with their own chief‚Äîthe Nakota Mdewakan (Note‚ÄîOlder attempts at Lakota language show a mistake in writing the sound 'bl' as 'md', such as summer, Bloketu, misprinted as mdoketu. Therefore, this word should be Blewakan.Hale, Horatio \\"Tutelo Tribe & Language\\" 1883. ) & Wahpeton, the Dakota Santee & Sisseton, the Nagoda Yankton & Yanktonai & the Lakota Teton. In this form, they were able to secure from the U.S. government a homeland, commonly referred to as Mni-Sota Makoce, or the Lakotah Republic.\\"Treaty of Fort Laramie - 1851\\". Retrieved 2008-01-02. However, conflicts increased between Sioux & American citizens in the decades leading up the Civil War & a poorly funded & organized Bureau of Indian Affairs had difficulty keeping peace between groups. This eventually resulted in the United States blaming the Sioux for the atrocities & rendering the treaty which recognized the nation of Lakotah null-in-void. The U.S., however, later recognized their fault in a Supreme Court case in the 1980s \\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 390 footnote 16. after several decades of failed lawsuits by the Sioux, yet little has been done to smooth the issue over to the best interests of both sides. European exploration=France= France was the first European nation to hold any real claim over what would become South Dakota. Its claims covered most of the modern state. However, at most a few French scouting parties may have entered eastern South Dakota.Schell, pp 24-26. In 1679 Daniel G. Duluth sent explorers west from Lake Mille Lacs, and they may have reached Big Stone Lake and the Coteau des Prairies. Pierre Le Sueur's traders entered the Big Sioux River Valley on multiple occasions. Evidence for these journeys is from a 1701 map by William De L'Isle that shows a trail to below the falls of the Big Sioux River from the Mississippi River. After 1713, France looked west to sustain its fur trade. The first Europeans to enter South Dakota from the north, the Verendrye brothers, began their expedition in 1743. The expedition started at Fort La Reine on Lake Manitoba, and was attempting to locate an all-water route to the Pacific Ocean. They buried a lead plate inscribed near Ft. Pierre; it was rediscovered by schoolchildren in 1913.Schell, pp. 27‚Äì29. =Spain= In 1762, France granted Spain all French territory west of the Mississippi River in the Treaty of Fontainebleau.Francis and Kaufman, p. 498. The agreement, which was signed in secret, was motivated by a French desire to convince Spain to come to terms with Britain and accept defeat in the Seven Years' War. In an attempt to defend against British expansion to the south and west, Spain adopted a policy for the upper Missouri which emphasized the development of closer trade relations with local tribes as well as greater exploration of the region, a primary focus of which would be a search for a water route to the Pacific Ocean.Schell, pp. 30‚Äì32. Although traders such as Jacques D'Eglise and Juan Munier had been active in the region for several years,Holder, p. 17. these men had been operating independently,Schell, pp. 31‚Äì32. and a determined effort to reach the Pacific and solidify Spanish control of the region had never been undertaken. In 1793, a group commonly known as the Missouri Company was formed in St. Louis, with the twin goals of trading and exploring on the upper Missouri.Schell, p. 32. The company sponsored several attempts to reach the Pacific Ocean, none of which made it further than the mouth of the Yellowstone. In 1794, Jean Truteau (also spelled Trudeau) built a cabin near the present-day location of Fort Randall,Schell, p. 33‚Äì34 and in 1795 the Mackay-Evans Expedition traveled up the Missouri as far as present-day North Dakota, where they expelled several British traders who had been active in the area.Schell, p. 35. In 1801, a post known as Fort aux Cedres was constructed by Registre Loisel of St. Louis, on Cedar Island on the Missouri about southeast of the present location of Pierre.Holder, p. 18.Schell, p. 36. This trading post was the major regional post until its destruction by fire in 1810. In 1800, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in the Treaty of San Ildefonso. American exploration Detail from a map drawn by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, showing much of what would become eastern and central South Dakota. In 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon for $11,000,000.Thompson (ed.), p. 57. The territory included most of the western half of the Mississippi watershed and covered nearly all of present-day South Dakota, except for a small portion in the northeast corner of the state. The region was still largely unexplored and unsettled, and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly referred to as the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the newly acquired region over a period of more than two years. The expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery, was tasked with following the route of the Missouri to its source, continuing on to the Pacific Ocean, establishing diplomatic relations with the various tribes in the area, and taking cartographic, geologic, and botanical surveys of the area.Thompson (ed.), pp. 56‚Äì57.Schell, p. 39. The expedition left St. Louis on May 14, 1804 with 45 men and 15 tons of supplies in three boats (one keelboat and two pirogues). The party progressed slowly against the Missouri's current, reaching what is today South Dakota on August 22.Thompson (ed.), p. 58. Near present-day Vermillion, the party hiked to the Spirit Mound after hearing local legends of the place being inhabited by \\"little spirits\\" (or \\"devils\\"). Shortly after this, a peaceful meeting took place with the Yankton Sioux,Thompson (ed.), p. 59. while an encounter with the Lakota Sioux further north was not as uneventful. The Lakota mistook the party as traders, at one point stealing a horse. Weapons were brandished on both sides after it appeared as though the Lakota were going to further delay or even halt the expedition, but they eventually stood down and allowed the party to continue up the river and out of their territory.Schell, pp. 41‚Äì42. In north central South Dakota, the expedition acted as mediators between the warring Arikara and Mandan.Schell, p. 42. After leaving the state on October 14, the party wintered with the Mandan in North Dakota before successfully reaching the Pacific Ocean and returning by the same route, safely reaching St. Louis in 1806.Thompson (ed.), pp. 60‚Äì61. On the return trip, the expedition spent only 15 days in South Dakota, traveling more swiftly with the Missouri's current.Schell, p. 43. Pittsburgh lawyer Henry Marie Brackenridge was South Dakota's first recorded tourist. In 1811 he was hosted by fur trader Manuel Lisa. Fur trading In 1817, an American fur trading post was set up at present-day Fort Pierre, beginning continuous American settlement of the area. During the 1830s, fur trading was the dominant economic activity for the few white people who lived in the area. More than one hundred fur-trading posts were in present-day South Dakota in the first half of the 19th century, and Fort Pierre was the center of activity. General William Henry Ashley, Andrew Henry, and Jedediah Smith of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and Manuel Lisa and Joshua Pilcher of the St. Louis Fur Company, trapped in that region. Pierre Chouteau, Jr. brought the steamship Yellowstone to Fort Tecumseh on the Missouri River in 1831. In 1832 the fort was replaced by Fort Pierre Chouteau, Jr.: today's town of Fort Pierre. Pierre bought the Western Department of John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company and renamed it Pratte, Chouteau and Company, and then Pierre Chouteau and Company. It operated in present-day South Dakota from 1834‚Äì1858. Most trappers and traders left the area after European demand for furs dwindled around 1840.Hasselstrom, p. 129. American settlement In 1855, the U.S. Army bought Fort Pierre but abandoned it the following year in favor of Fort Randall to the south. Settlement by Americans and Europeans was by this time increasing rapidly, and in 1858 the Yankton Sioux signed the 1858 Treaty, ceding most of present-day eastern South Dakota to the United States. Deadwood, like many other Black Hills towns, was founded after the discovery of gold. Land speculators founded two of eastern South Dakota's largest present-day cities: Sioux Falls in 1856 and Yankton in 1859. The Big Sioux River falls was the spot of an 1856 settlement established by a Dubuque, Iowa, company; that town was quickly removed by native residents. But in the following year, May 1857, the town was resettled and named Sioux Falls. That June, St. Paul, Minnesota's Dakota Land Company came to an adjacent , calling it Sioux Falls City. In June 1857, Flandreau and Medary, South Dakota, were established by the Dakota Land Company. Along with Yankton in 1859, Bon Homme, Elk Point, and Vermillion were among the new communities along the Missouri River or border with Minnesota. Settlers therein numbered about 5,000 in 1860. In 1861, Dakota Territory was established by the United States government (this initially included North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Montana and Wyoming). Settlers from Scandinavia, Germany, Ireland, Czechoslovakia and Russia, as well as elsewhere in Europe and from the eastern U.S. states increased from a trickle to a flood, especially after the completion of an eastern railway link to the territorial capital of Yankton in 1872, and the discovery of gold in the Black Hills in 1874 during a military expedition led by George A. Custer. An increasing population caused Dakota Territory to be divided in half and a bill for statehood for North Dakota and South Dakota (as well as Montana and Washington) titled the Enabling Act of 1889 was passed on February 22, 1889 during the Administration of Grover Cleveland. It was left to his successor, Benjamin Harrison, to sign proclamations formally admitting North and South Dakota to the Union on November 2, 1889. Harrison directed his Secretary of State James G. Blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded. Issues With statehood South Dakota was now in a position to make decisions on the major issues it confronted: prohibition, women's suffrage, the location of the state capital, the opening of the Sioux lands for settlement, and the cyclical issues of drought (severe in 1889) and low wheat prices (1893‚Äì1896).John E. Miller, \\"More than Statehood on Their Minds: South Dakota Joins the Union, 1889.\\" Great Plains Quarterly (1990) 10: 206-217 online. In early 1889 a prohibition bill passed the new state legislature, only to be vetoed by Governor Louis Church. Fierce opposition came from the wet German community, with financing from beer and liquor interests.Jon Lauck, et al. The Plains Political Tradition: Essays on South Dakota Political Tradition (South Dakota State Historical Society Press, 2011) pp 51-59. The Yankee women organized to demand suffrage, as well as prohibition. Neither party supported their cause, and the wet element counter- organized to block women's suffrage.Patricia O‚ÄôKeefe Easton, \\"Woman Suffrage in South Dakota: The Final Decade 1911-1920,\\" South Dakota History 13#3 (1983): 206-226 online Popular interest reached a peak in the debates over locating the state capital. Prestige, real estate values and government jobs were at stake, as well as the question of access in such a large geographical region with limited railroads. Huron was the temporary site, centrally located Pierre was the best organized contender, and three other towns were in the running. Real estate speculators had money to toss around. Pierre, population 3200, made the most generous case to the voters‚Äîits promoters truly believed it would be the next Denver and be the railway hub of the Dakotas. The North Western railroad came through but not the others it expected. In 1938 Pierre counted 4000 people and three small hotels.John Elmer Dalton, A history of the location of the state capital in South Dakota (No. 14. Governmental Research Bureau, University of South Dakota, 1945).Federal Writers' Project, A South Dakota Guide (1938, 1993) pp 130‚Äì137.The 1889 election results were Pierre 27,096; Huron 14,944; Watertown 11,970; Sioux Falls 11,763; Mitchell 7,516; and Chamberlain 2,414. Miller, p. 216. =Indian affairs= The national government continued to handle Indian affairs. The Army's 1874 Custer expedition took place despite the fact that the western half of present-day South Dakota had been granted to the Sioux by the Treaty of Fort Laramie as part of the Great Sioux Reservation. The Sioux declined to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and the Great Sioux War of 1876 broke out after the U.S. failed to stop white miners and settlers from entering the region. The Sioux were eventually defeated and settled on reservations within South Dakota and North Dakota. In 1889 Harrison sent general George Crook with a commission to persuade the Sioux to sell half their reservation land to the government. It was believed that the state would not be viable unless more land was made available to settlers. Crook used a number of dubious methods to secure agreement and obtain the land.Heather Cox Richardson, Wounded Knee: Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre (Basic Books, 2013), pp. 97-105, . On December 29, 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. It was the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Sioux Nation, the massacre resulted in the deaths of 300 Sioux, many of them women and children. In addition 25 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the episode. Railroads and western expansion Railroads played a central role in South Dakota transportation from the late 19th century until the 1930s, when they were surpassed by highways. The Milwaukee Road and the Chicago & North Western were the state's largest railroads, and the Milwaukee's east‚Äìwest transcontinental line traversed the northern tier of the state. About of railroad track were built in South Dakota during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, though only were active in 2007. The railroads sold land to prospective farmers at very low rates, expecting to make a profit by shipping farm products out and home goods in. They also set up small towns that would serve as shipping points and commercial centers, and attract businessmen and more farmers. The Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway (M&StL;) in 1905, under the leadership of vice president and general manager L. F. Day, added lines from Watertown to LeBeau and from Conde through Aberdeen to Leola. It developed town sites along the new lines and by 1910, the new lines served 35 small communities.Don L. Hofsommer, \\"Boosterism and Townsite Development Along the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad in South Dakota,\\" Journal of the West (2003) 42#4 pp 8-16. Not all of the new towns survived. The M&StL; situated LeBeau along the Missouri River on the eastern edge of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. The new town was a hub for the cattle and grain industries. Livestock valued at one million dollars were shipped out in 1908, and the rail company planned a bridge across the Missouri River. Allotment of the Cheyenne River Reservation in 1909 promised further growth. By the early 1920s, however, troubles multiplied, with the murder of a local rancher, a fire that destroyed the business district, and drought that ruined ranchers and farmers alike. LeBeau became a ghost town.Don L. Hofsommer, \\"A Promise Broken: LeBeau and the Railroad,\\" South Dakota History (2003) 33#1 pp 1-17. Most of the traffic was freight, but the main lines also offered passenger service. After the European immigrants settled, there never were many people moving about inside the state. Profits were slim. Automobiles and busses were much more popular, but there was an increase during World War II when gasoline was scarce. All passenger service was ended in the state by 1969.Don L. Hofsommer, \\"The Watertown Express and the 'Hog and Human': M & St. L Passenger Service In South Dakota, 1884-1960, South Dakota History (1973) 3#2 pp 127-155City of Sheridan v. United States, 303 F.Supp. 990 (D. Wyo. 1969)Jim Scribbins, \\"The Milwaukee Road Remembered,\\" p 53South Dakota State Railroad Museum, \\"South Dakota Railroad Timeline\\" http://www.sdsrm.org/uploads/4/8/5/4/48543011/sdrrtimeline.pdf Retail In the rural areas farmers and ranchers depended on local general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criteria was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying off the bill when crops or cattle were later sold; the owner's ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success.Lewis E. Atherton, The Frontier Merchant in Mid-America (University of Missouri Press, 1971) In the cities consumers had much more choice, and bought their dry goods and supplies at locally owned department stores. They had a much wider selection of goods than in the country general stores and price tags that gave the actual selling price. The department stores provided a very limited credit, and set up attractive displays and, after 1900, window displays as well. Their clerks‚Äîusually men before the 1940s‚Äîwere experienced salesmen whose knowledge of the products appealed to the better educated middle-class housewives who did most of the shopping. The keys to success were a large variety of high-quality brand-name merchandise, high turnover, reasonable prices, and frequent special sales. The larger stores sent their buyers to Denver, Minneapolis, and Chicago once or twice a year to evaluate the newest trends in merchandising and stock up on the latest fashions. By the 1920s and 1930s, large mail-order houses such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward provided serious competition, making the department stores rely even more on salesmanship and close integration with the community.Henry C. Klassen, \\"T.C. Power & Bro.: The Rise of a Small Western Department Store, 1870‚Äì1902,\\" Business History Review, Volume: 66. Issue: 4. 1992. pp 671+ in JSTORWilliam R. Leach, \\"Transformations in a Culture of Consumption: Women and Department Stores, 1890‚Äì1925,\\" Journal of American History 71 (Sept. 1984): 319-42 in JSTOR Many entrepreneurs built stores, shops, and offices along Main Street. The most handsome ones used pre-formed, sheet iron facades, especially those manufactured by the Mesker Brothers of St. Louis. These neoclassical, stylized facades added sophistication to brick or wood-frame buildings throughout the state.Arthur A. Hart, \\"Sheet Iron Elegance: Mail Order Architecture in Montana,\\" Montana Dec 1990, Vol. 40 Issue 4, pp 26‚Äì31 Dust bowl thumbA South Dakota farm during the Dust Bowl, 1936During the 1930s, several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and over- cultivation of farmland produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than seven percent between 1930 and 1940. World War II and the modern era Prosperity returned with the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war.Schell, pp. 317‚Äì320. Over 68,000 South Dakotans served in the armed forces during the war, of which over 2,200 were killed. =Dams= In 1944, the Pick-Sloan Plan was passed as part of the Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially located in South Dakota.Schell, pp. 323‚Äì325. Flood control, hydroelectricity and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs. On the night of June 9‚Äì10, 1972, heavy rainfall in the eastern Black Hills caused the Canyon Lake Dam on Rapid Creek to fail. The failure of the dam, combined with heavy runoff from the storm, turned the usually small creek into a massive torrent that washed through central Rapid City. The flood resulted in 238 deaths and destroyed 1,335 homes and around 5,000 automobiles. Damage from the flood totaled $160 million (the equivalent of $664 million today). On April 19, 1993, Governor George Mickelson was killed in a plane crash in Iowa while returning from a business meeting in Cincinnati.Saturday marks anniversary of deadly crash. Sioux City Journal. 18 April 2008. (accessed November 11, 2008) Several other state officials were also killed in the crash. Mickelson, who was in the middle of his second term as governor, was succeeded by Walter Dale Miller. Changing industries In recent decades, South Dakota has transformed from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since the completion of the interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills being especially impacted. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has since been followed by several other financial companies.Hetland, Cara. Sioux Falls 25 years after Citibank's arrival. Minnesota Public Radio. 24 February 2006. (accessed 23 March 2007) In 2007, the site of the recently closed Homestake gold mine near Lead was chosen as the location of a new underground research facility. Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states. The Cattleman's Blizzard of October 2013 killed tens of thousands of livestock in western South Dakota, and was one of the worst blizzards in the state's history.

Von Frankenberg studied under Inayat Khan, who first brought this mystical order of Islam to the West, before going on to found the first Sufi society in Australia. Early life Friedrich Elliot von Frankenberg und LudwigsdorfPossibly a descendant of Abraham von Franckenberg? was born in Germany on 2 January 1889, to an aristocratic and cultured family and raised mostly in Germany. His father, Friedrich von Frankenberg, was a German baron of independent means, while his mother, Jessie Elliot, was the daughter of a wealthy Australian industrialist family. Her family owned property in Algeria, where her father resided there for lengthy periods, and the young family spent some time in North Africa. This may be where Von Frankenberg first encountered Islam. He later became an Officer for the German Crown Prince, and developed an interest in collecting rare works on Eastern and Islamic literature. In 1925 and 1926 he attended the Sufi Movement Summer School, led annually by Inayat Khan at Suresnes, in France. He was accepted by Khan as a student (mureed), and given the Sufi name of Momin (meaning faithful), as well as instruction in spiritual practices. In 1927, Von Frankenberg immigrated to Australia. His mother had inherited a substantial estate from her father, but it had been frozen during World War I because Elliot and her son were German nationals. He seems to have initially travelled to Australia in order to settle his claim to the family property. In Australia, he married an Australian woman, Olive Pauline Ward Taylor. She was generally known as Stella, or by her Sufi name of Lila, was an accomplished concert pianist and member of a family in Sydney who ran a successful business. In the 1930s the Von Frankenbergs settled on a dairy farm called \\"Spring Hills\\" at Camden, on the outskirts of Sydney, where Von Frankenberg was known locally as \\"the Baron\\". From the 1930s to the end of his life Von Frankenberg worked to spread Sufism in Australia and established and led the first Sufi groups in Australia. During World War II, he came under suspicion from the Australian authorities, due mostly to his German background. He was questioned and his mail was monitored, but he was not interned. Death and legacy Von Frankenberg died in 1950 at the age of 61 and was buried in the Camden cemetery. He left his personal library, a collection of \\"many rare translations of Muslim, Eastern and other texts he collected in Europe between the 1890s and 1920s\\", as well as many early Australian editions of works by Inayat Khan, other pamphlets and ephemera that shed light on the early history of Sufism in Australia. After his death, the small movement that he had founded split, with some members following his student the Australian poet Francis Brabazon into becoming disciples of Meher Baba in Queensland and Dr Karel Frederik Rechlien Jansen (Murshid Sharif), later the National Representative for the Sufi Movement in Australia (SMIA), an affiliate of the International Sufi Movement. Avatar's Abode is a spiritual retreat about north of Brisbane, near Woombye, dedicated to Meher Baba, established by Brabazon after purchasing the land with money left to him by Von Frankenberg. Von Frankenberg's library was also willed to Brabazon, and which is included in the collection now kept at Avatar's Abode in the Francis Brabazon Library. Von Frankenberg was the founder of the first Sufi society in Australia, and had a major impact on the growth of the tradition.

In 1975 Freeman left the military and the couple eventually moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. On June 8, 1978 the First Presidency of the LDS Church announced that church president Spencer W. Kimball had received a revelation and that the Lord \\"has heard our prayers, and ... has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows there from, including the blessings of the temple ... without regard for race or color\\". On June 10, 1978, at a stake priesthood meeting, Freeman's name was presented and received unanimous approval for ordination to the Melchizedek priesthood. On June 11, 1978, three days after the announcement of the revelation, Freeman was ordained to the office of elder in the Melchizedek priesthood. The ordination was performed by his Bishop Jay Harold Swain. Typically men are ordained to the office of a priest in the Aaronic priesthood approximately one year prior to ordination as an elder in the Melchizedek priesthood. Due to his years of faithfulness and spiritual aptitude, Freeman's ecclesiastical leaders felt that it would be appropriate to ordain him to the office of elder without prior ordination to the Aaronic priesthood. Thus, unlike many men of black African descent who were ordained to the office of priest in the Aaronic priesthood that same day, Freeman is recognized as the first to be ordained an elder as a result of the revelation.Elijah Abel‚Äîgrandson of early Latter Day Saint Elijah Abel‚Äîreceived the Melchizedek priesthood and was ordained an elder on 29 September 1935, 99 years after his grandfather was also so ordained. On July 23, 1978, Freeman was sealed to his wife and their two sons, Alexander and Zechariah, in the Salt Lake Temple and thereby became one of the first men of black African descent to receive this ordinance. Thomas S. Monson, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, officiated at the ceremony. In 1986, Freeman moved to Denver, Colorado, where he was employed as the overseer of maintenance of the LDS Church's Denver Colorado Temple for 15 years. He moved back to Salt Lake City in 2001. In 1993, Freeman adopted his daughter's son J.J. Freeman. J.J. lived with Freeman for the next seven years. After 2001, Freeman moved to the Salt Lake Valley where he served for a time as an LDS Church bishop.

After the beginning of the 20th century, profits declined while Progressive reformers sought to curb capitalism. They imagined a civilized Nevada of universities, lofty idealism, and social reform. But an economic bust during the 1910s and disillusionment from failures at social reform and a population decline of nearly one-fourth meant that by 1920 Nevada had degenerated into a \\"beautiful desert of buried hopes.\\"Wilbur S..

The Paiute, Shoshone, Quoeech, Washoe, and Walapai tribes had inhabited Nevada for millennia before Euro-Americans arrived in the 18th century.GoodReads.com book review of: =PrehistoryExploration, New Spain, and Mexico= In the 1770s, Franciscan missionary Francisco Garc√©s, born in Morata del Conde, Aragon, Spain in 1738, was the first European in the area. Nevada was annexed as a part of the Spanish Empire in the northwestern territory of New Spain. Administratively, the area of Nevada was part of the Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Nevada became a part of Alta California (Upper California) province in 1804 when the Californias were split. With the Mexican War of Independence won in 1821, the province of Alta California became a territory‚Äînot a state‚Äîof Mexico, due to the small population. In later years, a desire for increased autonomy led to several attempts by the Alta Californians to gain independence from Mexico. Jedediah Smith entered the Las Vegas Valley in 1827, and Peter Skene Ogden traveled the Humboldt River in 1828. As a result of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico permanently lost Alta California in 1848. The new areas acquired by the United States continued to be administered as territories. As part of the Mexican Cession (1848) and the subsequent California Gold Rush that used Emigrant Trails through the area, the state's area evolved first as part of the Utah Territory, then the Nevada Territory (March 2, 1861; named for the Sierra Nevada). The capital is Carson City. =Territory= Nevada became part of the United States with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Mexico in 1848. Mexico had never established any control in Nevada, but American mountain men were in Washoe (the early name for Nevada) as early as 1827. A permanent American presence began in 1851 when the Mormons set up way stations en route to the California goldfields. In the absence of any governmental authority, some 50 Mormons and non-Mormon prospectors and cattle ranchers drew up the \\"Washoe code\\" to deal with land claims; its coverage eventually covered other governmental issues. There still was no federal presence in the area so religious tensions worsened and petitions of complaint went to Washington. Non-Mormons sought annexation to California. Utah Territory countered this by incorporating the area as a county. When Federal troops were sent to Utah in 1857, the Mormons left Washoe. The non-Mormons took over and launched a move for separate territorial status. The early 1860s saw the end of an Indian war, the great Comstock mining boom of 1859 in Virginia City and the coming of the Civil War. The provisional territorial government led to the creation of the Nevada Territory by Congress in 1861. The pragmatic attempts to establish workable frontier institutions had failed and the paternalistic territorial system was welcomed.Kent D. Richards, Rudimentary Government In Nevada,\\" Arizona and the West, 1969, Vol. 11#3 pp. 213‚Äì232 =Statehood= Statehood came in 1864 following a Carson City convention (July 4‚Äì28) and a public vote on September 7 (the population of 6,857 in 1860 increased to 42,941 in 1870), although Nevada had far fewer than the 60,000 people usually required. The University of Nevada was founded in Elko in 1874 and moved to Reno in 1885 (extension classes began at Las Vegas in 1951). =Water sources= The largest United States reservoir (Lake Mead) was created by the Hoover Dam on the state's 1867 Colorado River border (construction began in 1931). From 1930 to 2000, the Clark County population grew from 8,532 to 1,375,765; while the Reno population increased from 18,529 to 180,480. =Mining= Winnemucca Mountain The 1859 Comstock Lode discovery opened the era of silver mining in Nevada, and attracted thousands of miners‚Äîmost from California. It was discovered by James Finney in Carson County. Disputes over the legal limits of a claim soon went to court, as the Law of the Apex, used to determine those limits, was unworkable for the deep ore bodies in the Comstock. The legal and judicial system of Carson County was unprepared for the tremendous demands placed on it. Judges were underpaid and underqualified, bribery of witnesses and jurors was commonplace, vague record-keeping created nearly insurmountable difficulties with property titles, and evidence was often destroyed. Though workable mining laws still were needed, the resignation of the entire territorial supreme court in 1864 did cause litigation to stop and allowed mining work to resume.Bruce Alverson, \\"The Limits of Power: Comstock Litigation, 1859‚Äì1864,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, March 2000, Vol. 43#1 pp. 74‚Äì99 There was a gold rush that created Aurora in (1860). Located on the disputed border with California, at one time Aurora was the county seat of counties in California and Nevada until the boundary dispute was settled locating Aurora in Nevada. The 1867 expansion of the state's southern boundary was prompted by the discovery of gold in the area since officials thought Nevada would be better able to oversee the expected gold rush. By 1872, Nevada mining was an industry of speculation and immense wealth.Michael J. Makley, The Infamous King of the Comstock: William Sharon and the Gilded Age in the West (2006) After 1870, however, the mining industry went into eclipse, as the state's Silverite politicians worked to secure laws to require the federal government to purchase silver. The discovery of silver and gold in 1910 near Tonopah set off a boom that ended Nevada's Economic depression. The operators used the best available technology to recover gold and silver from ore, but by modern standards, there were many inefficiencies and chemical pollution. Methods included the use of the arrastra, the patio process, the Freiberg process, and the Washoe pan process. Estimates of value lost through recovery processes ran as high as 25%. Mine operators sought improved technology but were unwilling to wait years or decades for it to arrive. No one at the time understood the health problems such metals as mercury could cause.Eugene J. Michal, \\"Win Some, Lose Some: The Evolution of Milling Practice on the Comstock Lode,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, June 2005, Vol. 48#2 pp. 255‚Äì276 =Transportation= Although the transcontinental railroad crossed the state in 1869, most towns and mines were remote from it and required a network of wagon freight and stagecoaches. Numerous small companies supplied the horses, mules, and wagons for hauling borax and silver ore. Stagecoaches were notoriously uncomfortable across the roadless land, but were better than the alternatives and flourished until a railroad finally arrived. Hold-ups were rare and usually involved petty theft since armed guards were an effective deterrent. Mail contracts kept stage lines afloat and allowed the emergence of a class of entrepreneurs who won contracts and subcontracted the actual work., John F. Due, \\"Road Transport in Nevada: Wagon Freights and Stagecoaches 1860‚Äì895,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Dec 1999, Vol. 42#4 pp. 222‚Äì255 The Eureka and Palisade Railroad was a narrow-gauge railroad ninety miles long built-in 1875 to carry silver-lead ore from Eureka, Nevada, to the Southern Pacific Railroad trunk line that ran through Palisade. Nevertheless, despite the determined and colorful management style of John Sexton, the line succumbed to the effects of flood, fire, competing for road traffic, and dwindling amounts of ore extracted in Eureka. The rails and rolling stock of the last surviving narrow-gauge railroad in Nevada were removed in 1938.Jorja Muir, \\"Eureka and Palisade Railroad,\\" Northeastern Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Dec 1999, Vol. 99#4 pp. 92‚Äì107 Historic highways include the 1937 US 6 and 1919 US 50 (Lincoln Highway). The 1926 destination of the first airmail flight was Elko. Interstate 15 in Nevada was completed in 1974, while the Lovelock bypass was the last completed section of Interstate 80 in Nevada. =Mining towns= Golconda was a mining town in northern Nevada built when the discovery of copper, silver, gold, and lead brought entrepreneurs who opened mines and mills in the district. A diverse society of native-born Americans, French, Portuguese, Paiutes, Chinese, and other people came to Golconda to live and work. From 1898‚Äì1910, the town had a train depot, several hotels, a school, businesses, newspapers, and two brothels. Its population peaked at about six hundred in 1907‚Äì08. Although boosters predicted growth for Golconda, after 1910 the mines played out, leaving the region as an area of ranches and farms. Most of the town's buildings from its mining heyday are gone, and Golconda today is a minor stop on Interstate 80., John M. Gomes, \\"Golconda'S Glory Days, 1898‚Äì910,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, June 2007, Vol. 50#2 pp. 145‚Äî167 A burro-drawn wagon hauling lumber and supplies into Goldfield, Nevada, ca.1904. In 1903 only 36 people lived in the new town. By 1908 Goldfield was Nevada's largest city, with over 25,000 inhabitants. Tuscarora was founded in Elko County after an expedition by trader William Heath discovered gold. As miners flocked to the town in 1867‚Äì70, a fort was built to offer protection from Indian raids and a water ditch was created to supply the town with water. Many Chinese men who had been employed by the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) relocated to the town and began placer mining. A second boom began following the discovery of silver in 1876‚Äì77.\\"Tuscarora Mystery,\\" Northeastern Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, 2008, Issue 2, pp. 38‚Äì40 A strike at Tonopah (1900, silver) was followed by strikes in Goldfield (1902‚Äì1919, gold) and Rhyolite (1904‚Äì1911, gold). The strikes brought Nevada to the forefront of the nation again, just as the Comstock Lode in Virginia City, Nevada, had in the late 1800s. While the Comstock made dozens of owners rich, the gold in Goldfield and the stock sold on speculation made two people exceedingly rich. George S. Nixon and George Wingfield were worth $30 million after taking their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company public in 1906.Moe, Al W. The Roots of Reno, , 2008, p. 153 The partner's had a loss the following year and Nixon's Nye County Bank struggled. Wingfield, however, reaped an even greater fortune from real estate, especially after moving to Reno, Nevada. After gambling was legalized in 1931, Wingfield again had money coming in from his leases and a partnership in several casinos. As many Nevada towns went through the boom and bust cycle, gambling keep the state's economy strong. However, remnants of mining resulted in the 1989 designation of the Carson River Mercury (Superfund) Site Rio Tinto was developed after the discovery of copper in Northern Elko County's Cope Mining District. The town moved from mine to mine and it went from boom to bust in regular cycles. In 1919 Frank Hunt discovered copper in the area and later named his claim Rio Tinto. Once investors and big mining companies became interested in Hunt's copper, the town soon developed and filled with homes to house the miners. After all the copper was removed, Rio Tinto suffered the same fate as most boom towns and vanished.Dan Basa√±ez, \\"Copper in the Cope,\\" Northeastern Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, 2009, Issue 4, pp. 98-has‚Äì103 Homesteading Over 87% of the Nevada area is owned by the federal government, as homesteads of maximum in the arid state were generally too little land for a viable farm. Instead, early settlers would homestead land surrounding a water source, and then graze cattle on the adjacent public land, which is useless without access to water. The Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909, the establishment of a state dry-farming experiment station, and private promotional efforts stimulated dry farming within a fifty-mile radius of Wells, Nevada, but a combination of low precipitation, intense flash flooding, short summers, abundant jackrabbits, mediocre soil, and the faulty judgment of the settlers themselves virtually ended the ill- favored experiment after 1916.Marshall E. Bowen, \\"Bitter Times: The Summers of 1915 and 1916 on Northeast Nevada's Dry Farms,\\" Northeastern Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, March 1993, Vol. 93#1 pp. 2‚Äì26 Twentieth century The state was by far the smallest in terms of population. The 1930 census reported 91,000 people, with Reno the largest city at 19,000 and Las Vegas at 5,000. 62% of the people lived in towns with fewer than 2,500 people or in rural areas alongside the 340,000 cattle and 830,000 sheep. =Politics= The gold discovery in Tonopah in 1900 brought together a group of men who dominated Nevada politics for a half century. They included George Wingfield (mine owner, banker and behind-the-scenes player); George Nixon (banker, editor and cofounder of the Silver party); Key Pittman (U.S. Senator), Vail Pittman (Key Pittman's brother; governor); Pat McCarran (U.S. Senator) and George Thatcher (a leader of the state Democratic party)Driggs and Goodall, Nevada Politics ch 4 John Edward Jones and Reinhold Sadler, Silver Party governors of Nevada, during 1895‚Äì1903, shared like backgrounds and rose to political power by the same route. Each was a European immigrant who came to the state in its mining boom of the 1870s, prospered financially, and engaged in politics until the boom collapsed late in the 1870s. Then Jones and Sadler embraced bimetallism and a companion cure-all for Nevada's economic ills‚Äîreclamation of desert land in order to provide an economy based partly on agriculture.Mary Ellen Glass, \\"The Silver Governors: Immigrants in Nevada Politics,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Sept 1978, Vol. 21#3 pp. 170‚Äì188 =Religion and ethnicity= Because most of Nevada was sparsely populated and was subject to economic booms-and-busts accompanied by population fluctuations, Catholic churches faced difficulties in serving spiritually their scattered and mobile communicants. Nevada Catholic parish life until 1900 reflected the Irish heritage of its parish clergy and the bulk of their flocks. Slavic, Italian, and Basque Catholics moved to the state after 1900 and sometimes allied with native-born Americans so that the traditional dominance of Irish Catholics diminished markedly by the 1930s.James S. Olson, \\"Pioneer Catholicism in Eastern and Southern Nevada, 1864‚Äì1931,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Sep 1983, Vol. 26#3 pp. 159‚Äì171 Italian Americans worked in Nevada as miners, but, unlike many other immigrants, enough Italians stayed after the mining booms collapsed; they became the largest European ethnic groups by 1910. Many operated farms and ranches. Besides exercising significant economic clout, they have fundamentally influenced the Nevada social order in other ways, in part because of their persistent anticlericalism.Albin J. Cofone, \\"Themes in the Italian Settlement of Nevada,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, June 1982, Vol. 25#2 pp. 116130 =Gambling= Las Vegas area, where the population grew from 5 thousand in 1930 to 1.9 million in 2008. Because of hostility from miners and their sympathizers, Nevada's territorial and state antigambling laws were mostly unenforced from 1859 until the Comstock Lode mining booms collapsed in the 1870s. After 1881, the state attempted to restrict gambling through licensing and other statutory controls. Opponents of gambling and prostitution became organized and in the Progressive Era at last persuaded state legislators to prohibit gambling statewide in 1910 as part of a nationwide anti-gaming crusade.Phillip I. Earl, \\"Veiling the Tiger: The Crusade against Gambling, 1859‚Äì1910,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Dec 1985, Vol. 29#3 pp. 175‚Äì204 During the Great Depression in the United States, Nevada legalized gambling‚Äîterming it \\"gaming\\"‚Äîin 1931; (the Northern Club received the first license). At the time, the leading proponents of gambling expected that it would be a short term fix until the state's economic base widened to include less cyclical industries. However, re-outlawing gambling has never been seriously considered since, and the industry has become Nevada's primary source of revenue today. Gambling taxes account for 34% of state revenue. Also in 1931 the residence requirement for divorce was reduced to six weeks, making Reno a famous mecca for the quickie divorce and people from all over the country to \\"take the cure.\\" In the 1930s, Reno's Bank Club was the state's largest employer. It was also the largest casino in the world until Harold's Club surpassed it in the 1950s.Moe, Al W. Nevada's Golden Age of Gambling, Puget Sound Books, 2002, p. 68 The Second World War was very good to Reno as local bases and those in Northern California helped boost the economy. In the late 1940s \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel helped get Las Vegas on the map by first building the most expensive casino in the world, the Flamingo, and then by being gunned down in his Beverly Hills home. Las Vegas casinos of the 1950s were mostly low-rise building taking advantage of the wide-open spaces that Reno didn't offer in the downtown area of Virginia Street. However, Las Vegas boomed with new luxurious hotels in the 1960s and the city's gambling casinos drew players from all over the world, and away from Reno and Lake Tahoe. Gambling is what Nevada is famous for. The 1931 gambling law enabled the explosive growth of the Las Vegas area, where the population grew from 5 thousand in 1930 to 1.9 million in 2008. =Prostitution= Brothels have been tolerated in Nevada since the middle of the 19th century; one in Elko has been in business since 1902. In 1937, a law was enacted to require weekly health checks of all prostitutes. Reno and Las Vegas had red light districts, when the federal government prohibited all prostitution near military bases in 1942 (lifted in 1948). In 1951, both Reno and Las Vegas had closed their red light districts as public nuisances. In Clark County, prostitution is illegal.Albert, Alexa, \\"Brothel. Mustang Ranch and its Women\\". Random House 2001. Military activities Military and other government exploration of the territory included efforts by John C. Fr√©mont (1843), Lieutenant E. G. Beckwith (1854), and the Fortieth Parallel Survey (1867). During the American Civil War, the territory mustered infantry and cavalry, and skirmishes of the American Indian Wars occurred in Nevada during the Snake War (1864‚Äì1868). American Old West forts in Nevada included Fort Churchill, Fort Halleck, Fort McDermit, and Fort Schellbourne. The current Hawthorne Army Depot was established for munitions production in 1930. =World War II= Senator Pat McCarran and other Nevada officials campaigned successfully in Washington to open military installations in Nevada. It had vast lands, sunny weather and good rail connections. The Las Vegas Army Gunnery School, the Basic Magnesium plant, Nellis Air Force Base, and other facilities brought thousands of people to the area for training as well as workers to construct housing, air strips, and other military installations.Robert V. Nickel, \\"Dollars, Defense, and the Desert: Southern Nevada'S Military Economy and World War II,\\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Dec 2004, Vol. 47#4 pp. 303‚Äì327 Las Vegas Army Air Field and Tonopah AAF were created from existing airfields, and the United States Army Air Forces built four additional Nevada airfields in 1942, including Indian Springs AAF, Reno Army Air Base, and a facility near Fallon. Ranges and emergency strips included the Battle Mountain Flight Strip, the Black Rock Desert gunnery range (part of the Lovelock Aerial Gunnery Range during the Cold War), Churchill Flight Strip, and Owyhee Flight Strip. Both Tonopah AAF and Indian Springs AAF each had 5 auxiliary airstrips including Indian Springs' at Forty-Mile Canyon Field and Groom Lake Field. Camp Williston (1940‚Äì1944) at Boulder City provided security for Henderson's Basic Magnesium Plant (14,000 employees) and Hoover Dam (camp newspaper) (a concrete observation station still exists). =Nuclear tests= Nuclear testing began at the Nevada Proving Ground in 1951 with a 1 kiloton bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat. Over 1000 nuclear detonations were conducted until the site's last atmospheric detonation in 1962 and last underground detonation in 1992. In 2002, Congress approved the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository at the site. Notable military aircraft accidents in Nevada include the 1948 Lake Mead Boeing B-29 crash, the 1949 Stead AFB F-51 crash, and several USAF Thunderbird demonstration team crashes, including the 1982 Indian Springs AFAF formation that killed 4 pilots.

The USAF Red Flag combat exercise was first held in 1975 at the Nellis Air Force Range, and the United States Navy's TOPGUN school was moved to Naval Air Station Fallon in 1996.  Recent history  Nevada favors a highly individualistic political culture, giving it a libertarian‚Äìconservative political philosophy in an open society. Wealth from mining and gambling reinforced the individualistic ethic that early settlers brought with them. The libertarian ethic appears in the opposition of most Nevadans to big government, big labor, and big business. Labor unions, especially the SEIU which organizes hotel and casino workers, thrive among the minority workers in Las Vegas. Belief in limited government leads to an electorate that backs a pro-choice position on abortion while opposing the Equal Rights Amendment for women. The state's ongoing battles with the federal government involve the longstanding water rights dispute between Native Americans, backed by the federal government, and Nevada's ranchers; and the decade-long fight against the establishment of the nation's first permanent nuclear waste depository at Yucca Mountain.Don W.

The Carabineros was an armed carabiniers force of Spain under both the monarchy and the Second Republic. The formal mission of this paramilitary gendarmerie was to patrol the coasts and borders of the country, operating against fraud and smuggling. As such the Carabineros performed the dual roles of frontier guards and customs officials. The force was established in 1829 and lasted until 1940 when it was summarily disbanded and merged with the Guardia Civil.Real decreto organizando el Cuerpo de Carabineros de Costas y Fronteras para impedir el contrabando, 31 de marzo de 1829 - Gaceta de Madrid n¬∫39, p. 153Real decreto sobre la organizaci√≥n de Carabineros de Costas.

Commanders Among the notable commanders of the corps included Jos√© Olaguer Feli√∫ (1923‚Äì1927), Jos√© Mar√≠a Gal√°n and Gonzalo Queipo de Llano (1934‚Äì1936). History=First hundred years= The Carabineros Corps was established as the 'Royal Carabinier Corps of the Coasts and Borders' (Real Cuerpo de Carabineros de Costas y Fronteras) by a royal decree issued by King Fernando VII on 9 March 1829. It was led by Field Marshal Jos√© Ram√≥n Rodil at the time that Luis L√≥pez Ballesteros was Minister of Finance.Real decreto de organizaci√≥n del Cuerpo de Carabineros del Reino, 9 de diciembre 1842 - Gaceta de Madrid n¬∫2985 Shortly thereafter, in 1833, the corps was renamed as 'Carabiniers of the Royal Finance' (Carabineros de la Real Hacienda). Being placed under the Finance Ministry they went through a period of gradual neglect and by 1842 the Carabineros were almost dysfunctional as a corps and Field Marshal Mart√≠n Jos√© de Iriarte was entrusted with their reorganization. Thus the corps was reformed and re- organised as the 'Carabinier Corps of the Kingdom' (Cuerpo de Carabineros del Reino) in order to replace the former ineffective and discredited body. At the time of the Restoration the Carabineros and the Guardia Civil, the other paramilitary Spanish corps, were placed under the War Ministry, \\"for a better organization and discipline\\", being given a military character by means of a lawLey Adicional a la Constitutiva del Ej√©rcito de 19 de julio de 1889] that developed and modified certain aspects of the 1878 Constitutive Army Law (Ley Constitutiva del Ej√©rcito). The latter set the functions of the Armed Forces following the Spanish Constitution of 1876.Ram√≥n G√≥mez Mart√≠nez, El Estatuto Jur√≠dico-Constitucional del militar de carrera en Espa√±a.

N√∫m 209. 28 de julio de 1923, pp. 328 Despite this being a time of economic hardship, he was able to improve conditions of service within the corps; reducing the daily working hours to twelve. He also achieved the expansion and improvement of the Carabinier Corps' Schools ( Colegios del Cuerpo de Carabineros), where recruits were trained. General Olaguer Feliu was responsible for the construction of new quarters and repairing the existing ones; for the founding of schools for the sons and daughters of the Carabineros in certain locations. Finally Jos√© Olaguer Feli√∫ provided better schooling and conditions for orphans of Carabineros at the San Lorenzo de El Escorial Carabinier' Orphans School (Colegio de Hu√©rfanos de Carabineros de San Lorenzo del Escorial). In 1929, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the corps, a monument was built in recognition of the Carabineros, at San Lorenzo del Escorial. In addition the Great Cross of the Civil Order of Beneficence (Gran Cruz de la Orden Civil de Beneficencia) was awarded collectively to the members of the corps by King Alfonso XIII for deeds and services rendered by the Carabineros in fighting fires, floods and the rescuing of shipwrecked persons.Real decreto concediendo al Cuerpo de Carabineros la Gran Cruz de la Orden civil de Beneficencia, con distantivo negro y blanco, p. 1674, 10 de septiembre 1929 - Gaceta de Madrid n¬∫253 { - valign=\\"top\\" Royal Carabineros Seal; 1910.

With the regular army divided and the almost 50-50% split of the Civil Guard, the Republican government was heavily dependent on trained and properly equipped loyalist units such as the Carabineros and the Assault Guards to fight in the first crucial battles of the war. In mid-1936 there had been a total of about 16,096 men in the corps: 3 generals, 770 officers, 1,169 sub-officers and 14,154 Carabineros. Approximately a third were in the territories that fell to the rebel side (about 5‚Äì6,000 men) after the coup and the two-thirds that were in the areas controlled by the Republic (about 10,000) remained loyal to the established government.Alejandro de Quesada, The Spanish Civil War 1936‚Äì39 (2): Republican Forces, p. 36Henry Buckley & Paul Preston, The Life and Death of the Spanish Republic: A Witness to the Spanish Civil War, I.B.Tauris, 2013 As a professional force of generally proven loyalty to the Republic, the carabineros formed an elite unit, which was integrated into the mixed brigades of the Republican Army.Carlos Engel (1999); Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del Ej√©rcito Popular de la Rep√∫blica, p. 194, 221 and 225 The Carabinier corps was increased in strength to 40,000 men.

This measure was taken by the new regime as a reprisal for the majority of the carabinier units having remained loyal to the Republic during the rising of 1936. A law was passed on 15 March 1940 by which the Spanish Dictatorship terminated the Cuerpo de Carabineros, transferring its remaining personnel and assets to the Guardia Civil.Santiago √Ålvarez (1994); Negr√≠n personalidad Hist√≥rica, Volume 1, p√°g. 79 Article number 4 of the aforementioned law stated: Nine years after the end of Franco's dictatorship the Spanish Law 37/1984 of 22 October recognized the rights and services of those who had been part of the Armed Forces, Police and Carabiniers of the Spanish Republic (Reconocimiento de derechos y servicios prestados a quienes durante la Guerra Civil formaron parte de las Fuerzas Armadas, Fuerzas de Orden P√∫blico y Cuerpo de Carabineros de la Rep√∫blica).

When White explorers first entered the region, they encountered numerous American Indian tribes including the Arapaho, Bannock, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Crow, Gros Ventre, Kiowa, Nez Perce, Sioux, Shoshone and Ute. Early European observations Europeans may have ventured into the northern sections of the state in the century. Most of the southern part of modern-day Wyoming was nominally claimed by Spain and Mexico until the 1830s, but they had no presence. John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was probably the first American to enter the region in 1807. His reports of thermal activity in the Yellowstone area were considered at the time to be fictional. Robert Stuart and a party of five men returning from Astoria, Oregon discovered South Pass in 1812. The route was later followed by the Oregon Trail. In 1850, Jim Bridger located what is now known as Bridger Pass, which was later used by both the Union Pacific Railroad in 1868, and in the 20th century by Interstate 80. Bridger also explored the Yellowstone region and like Colter, most of his reports on that region of the state were considered at the time to be tall tales. During the early 19th century, fur trappers known as mountain men flocked to the mountains of western Wyoming in search of beaver. In 1824, the first mountain man rendezvous was held in Wyoming. The gatherings continued annually until 1840, with the majority of them held within Wyoming territory. Immigration trails 1859 map of route from Sioux City, Iowa, through Nebraska, to gold fields of Wyoming, partially following old Mormon trails. Independence Rock, a famous Wyoming landmark along the Oregon Trail The route later known as the Oregon Trail was already in regular use by traders and explorers in the early 1830s. The trail snakes across Wyoming, entering the state on the eastern border near the present day town of Torrington following the North Platte River to the current town of Casper. It then crosses South Pass, and exits on the western side of the state near Cokeville. In 1847, Mormon emigrants blazed the Mormon Trail, which mirrors the Oregon Trail, but splits off at South Pass and continues south to Fort Bridger and into Utah. Over 350,000 emigrants followed these trails to destinations in Utah, California and Oregon between 1840 and 1859. In 1859, gold was discovered in Montana, drawing miners north along the Bozeman and Bridger trails through the Powder River Country and Big Horn Basin respectively. Indian Wars A 12 pounder mountain howitzer on display at Fort Laramie in eastern Wyoming. The influx of emigrants and settlers into the state led to more encounters with the American Indian, resulting in an increase of military presence along the trails. Military posts such as Fort Laramie were established to maintain order in the area. In 1851, the first Treaty of Fort Laramie was signed between the United States and representatives of American Indian nations to ensure peace and the safety of settlers on the trails. The 1850s were subsequently quiet, but increased settler encroachment into lands promised to the tribes in the region caused tensions to rise again, especially after the Bozeman Trail was blazed in 1864 through the hunting grounds of the Powder River Country, which had been promised to the tribes in the 1851 treaty. As encounters between settlers and Indians grew more serious in 1865, Major General Grenville M. Dodge ordered the first Powder River Expedition to attempt to quell the violence. The expedition ended in a battle against the Arapaho in the Battle of the Tongue River. The next year the fighting escalated into Red Cloud's War which was the first major military conflict between the United States and the Wyoming Indian tribes. The second Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868 ended the war by closing the Powder River Country to whites. Violation of this treaty by miners in the Black Hills lead to the Black Hills War in 1876, which was fought mainly along the border of Wyoming and Montana. Cattle In 1866 Nelson Story, Sr. drove approximately 1000 head of Texas LonghornsSources on the actual number of cattle in the 1866 Nelson Story cattle drive vary widely. The most commonly seen numbers are 1000 and 3000.

The Wyoming Stock Growers Association is a historic American cattle organization created in 1873. The Association was started among Wyoming cattle ranchers to standardize and organize the cattle industry, but quickly grew into a political force that has been called \\"the de facto territorial government\\"Jackson, W. Turrentine. The Mississippi Valley Historical Review, Vol. 33, No. 4. (March 1947), pp. 571. of Wyoming's organization into early statehood, and wielded great influence throughout the Western United States.Homsher, Lola M. Archives of the Wyoming Stock Growers' Association The Mississippi Valley Historical Review, Vol. 33, No. 2. (September 1946), pp. 285. The association is still active to this day, but it is best known for its rich history and is perhaps most famous for its role in Wyoming's Johnson County War. In 1892 the Johnson County War, also known as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, took place in Johnson, Natrona and Converse County, Wyoming. It was fought between small settling ranchers against larger established ranchers in the Powder River Country and culminated in a lengthy shootout between local ranchers, a band of hired killers, and a sheriff's posse, eventually requiring the intervention of the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison. The events have since become a highly mythologized and symbolic story of the Wild West, and over the years variations of the storyline have come to include some of the west's most famous historical figures and gunslingers. The storyline and its variations have served as the basis for numerous popular novels, films, and television shows. Railroad In 1870, roughly three-eights of Wyoming's population was foreign born, coming primarily from Ireland, Germany and England.Wyoming: A Bicentennial History By Taft Alfred Larson pg. 82 The Union Pacific Railroad played a central role in the settlement of Wyoming. The land was good for cattle ranches, but without transportation it was too far for a cattle drive. The UP railroad companies had large land grants that were used to back the borrowings from New York and London that financed construction. UP was anxious to locate settlers upon the land as soon as possible, so there would be a steady outflow of cattle, and a steady inflow of manufactured items purchased by the ranchers. UP also built towns that were needed to service the railroad itself, with dining halls for passengers, construction crews, repair shops and housing for train crews. The towns attracted cattle drives and cowboys.David F Halass, Hell on Wheels: Wicked Towns Along the Union Pacific Railroad (2013)John C. Hudson, \\"Towns of the western railroads\\". Great Plains Quarterly 2#1 (1982): 41‚Äì54. online The UP reached the town of Cheyenne, which later became the state capital, in 1867. The railroad eventually spanned the entire state, boosting the population, and creating some of Wyoming's largest cities, such as Laramie, Rock Springs and Evanston.Robert G. Athearn, Union Pacific Country (1971). The railroad needed coal, which was discovered in quantity in the southwestern part of the state, especially around Rock Springs.David A. Wolff, Industrializing the Rockies: Growth, Competition, and Turmoil in the Coalfields of Colorado and Wyoming, 1868-1914 (2003). In 1885, a murderous riot known as the Rock Springs Massacre broke out when white miners drove out Chinese miners employed by the Union Pacific Coal Company in Rock Springs.Craig Storti, Incident at Bitter Creek: The Story of the Rock Springs Chinese Massacre (1991). Territory and statehood The name was used by Representative J. M. Ashley of Ohio, who introduced the Ashley Bill to Congress to provide a \\"temporary government for the territory of Wyoming\\". The name \\"Wyoming\\" was made famous by the 1809 poem Gertrude of Wyoming by Thomas Campbell.Pflieger, Pat \\"'Gertrude of Wyoming', by Thomas Campbell (1809)\\", merrycoz.org, Retrieved on July 3, 2008. The name is derived from the Delaware (Munsee) name xw√©:wam…ônk, meaning \\"at the big river flat\\", originally applied to the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania.Bright, William (2004). Native American Place Names of the United States. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576 historical coat of arms (illustrated, 1876). This territorial design was re-adopted at statehood (1890) until a complete redesign in 1893. After the arrival of the railroad, the population began to grow steadily in the Wyoming Territory, which was established on July 25, 1868. Unlike Colorado to the south, Wyoming never experienced a rapid population boom in the 19th century from any major mineral discoveries such as gold or silver. Inclusion of women's suffrage in the Wyoming constitution was debated in the constitutional convention, but ultimately accepted. The constitution was mostly borrowed from those of other states, but also included an article making all the water in Wyoming property of the state. Wyoming overcame the obstacles of low population and of being the only territory in the U.S. giving women the right to vote, and the United States admitted Wyoming into the Union as the 44th state on July 10, 1890. Suffrage In 1869, Wyoming territory granted women the right to vote, becoming the first U.S. state to extend suffrage to women. Wyoming was also the home of many other firsts for U.S. women in politics. The first time women served on a jury was in Wyoming (Laramie in 1870). Wyoming had the first female court bailiff (Mary Atkinson, Laramie, in 1870), and the country's first female justice of the peace (Esther Hobart Morris, South Pass City, in 1870). Wyoming became the first state in the Union to elect a female governor, Nellie Tayloe Ross, who was elected in 1924 and took office in January 1925. Yellowstone National Park The Hayden expedition in Wyoming as photographed by William Henry Jackson Following on the reports of men like Colter and Bridger, a number of organized expeditions were undertaken in northwestern Wyoming. The Cook‚ÄìFolsom‚ÄìPeterson Expedition in 1869 and the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition in 1870 confirmed the stories of the mountain men. In 1871, Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden led a formal geological survey of the area, the result of which ultimately convinced Congress to set aside the region. Yellowstone National Park became the world's first National Park in 1872. In August 1886, the U.S. Army was given administration of the park. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the new National Park Service. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites. Most of Yellowstone National Park is located in Wyoming.Yellowstone Park Foundation, The Yellowstone Park Foundation's Official Guide to Yellowstone National Park (2013)Aubrey L. Haines, The Yellowstone Story: A History of Our First National Park (2 vol. 1999) Wyoming is also home to the nation's first national monument (Devils Tower created in 1906), and the first national forest (Shoshone National Forest created in 1891). Settlers The Homestead Act of 1862 attracted many new farmers and ranchers to Wyoming, where they congregated along the fertile banks of the rivers. Most of the land in Wyoming in the 2nd half of the 19th century was in the public domain and so was open for both homesteading and open range for grazing cattle. As individual ranchers moved into the state, they became at odds with the larger ranches for control of the range and water sources. Tensions rose to a boiling point in April 1892 as an armed conflict known as the Johnson County War, fought between the large cattle operators and smaller ranchers and homesteaders. The increased number of settlers also brought with them merchants, as well as outlaws. A number of notable outlaws of the time started their careers in Wyoming, including Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, both of whom were incarcerated in Wyoming as young men. A remote area in Johnson County, Wyoming known as the Hole-in-the-Wall was a well known hideout for a loose association of outlaw gangs known as the Hole in the Wall Gang. It was used from the 1860s through the early 20th century by outlaws operating throughout Wyoming. Mining Precious metals were never discovered in great quantities, though a small amount of gold was discovered near South Pass prompting a small rush in the 1860s. Coal was discovered early and has been mined extensively through the state. Union Pacific Railroad ran several coal mines in the southern part of the state to supply the railroad. In 1885 tensions at a Union Pacific mine in Rock Springs resulted in the Rock Springs Massacre, one of the largest race riots in U.S. history. Oil is also plentiful throughout the state. In 1924, irregularities over the allocation of naval reserves near Casper resulted in the Teapot Dome Scandal. Natural gas, bentonite and uranium have also been mined through the state's history. One exception is the copper mines in Carbon County west of Encampment. The Ferris- Haggarty Mine Site supplied copper for the electrification of the world in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Historical memory After 1890 Wyoming pageants and parades, as well as school courses, increasingly told a nostalgic story of Wyoming as rooted in the frontier West. During the 1940s, Wyoming millionaire William R. Coe made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming. Coe wished to celebrate the values of the Western United States in order to meet the threat of communism.Liza Nicholas, \\"Wyoming as America: Celebrations, a Museum, and Yale\\", American Quarterly, Sept. 2002, 54#3 pp. 437‚Äì465 See also ;History of Wyoming *Bibliography of Wyoming history *Emigrant Trail in Wyoming *List of counties in Wyoming *List of ghost towns in Wyoming *List of governors of Wyoming *List of municipalities in Wyoming *Outline of Wyoming *Outline of Wyoming territorial evolution **Territory of Wyoming **State of Wyoming *Timeline of Wyoming history **Timeline of Cheyenne, Wyoming References Further reading * ; * * Cassity, Michael.

The species inhabits coastal waters in the Indo- Pacific, from Pakistan in the west to Japan and Australia in the east, often found over reefs. The razorbelly scad has a complex taxonomic history, and even recently has had its position in the genus Alepes challenged, but appears to be stable after a molecular phylogeny study supported its placement in Alepes. It is very similar to other scads in the same genus, but is readily identified by its unique teeth. Razorbelly scad are predatory fish, taking a variety of crustaceans and shrimps, and show a change in feeding intensity over the year. Reproduction and development has been extensively studied in India, where spawning occurs in a single event from January to September. The species is commonly taken in tropical fisheries, where it is marketed fresh or dried. Taxonomy and naming The razorbelly scad is classified in the scad genus Alepes, which is part of the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. Like a number of other members of Alepes, the razorbelly scad suffers from a complicated taxonomic history, in which the species has been described and named no less than seven times, and has had three of those names reassigned to different genera. The first person to describe and name the species was the German naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch in 1793, assigning the name Scomber kleinii putting the species in a genus of mackerel. This was later transferred to the jack genus Caranx and finally to the genus Alepes, which Swainson had created in 1839. This is the currently accepted name, as Bloch was the first to describe the fish, even though he put it in the wrong genus. In a marathon effort of synonymy, Georges Cuvier described the species under three separate names in 1833, of which two were reclassified into Alepes, forming the commonly used junior synonyms of Alepes para and Alepes kalla. The razorbelly scad was described and named three times after Cuvier's efforts by Bleeker, De Vis and Wakiya. In a 1942 review of Caranx kalla, Nichols tried to separate and rationalise a number of synonyms, even suggesting a subspecies of De Vis' Caranx queenslandiae be created. The type specimen of A. kleinii was collected from the Malabar Coast off India. Although commonly called razorbelly scad, and recognised as such by Fishbase, the species also is known as banded scad, goggle-eye scad and golden scad. The identity of the person honoured in the specific name is not knowv but it is almost certainly the German jurist, historian, botanist, zoologist and mathematician Jacob Theodor Klein (1685-1759), who was the author of a 5-volume history of fishes published in 1740-1749, who was also honoured by Bloch in the name Chaetodon kleinii. =Phylogeny= Although the species, including many of its synonyms, has been placed in the genus Alepes for some time, the nature of its teeth has made this placement controversial. Two authors have argued that the species should be reassigned to a new monotypic genus due to it having short conical teeth in comparison to the rest of Alepes' comblike teeth. This problem was addressed in a molecular phylogenetic study of the Carangidae in which A. kleinii and A. djedaba (Shrimp scad) were included. The results confirmed the placement of A. kleinii in Alepes, with the authors arguing the two species were too closely related to warrant placement in a new genus. Description The razorbelly scad has a series of bars on the upper bodyThe razorbelly scad is similar in body shape and profile to the rest of Alepes, possessing a strongly compressed ovate body. The dorsal profile of the body is definitively less convex than the ventral profile, giving the upper and lower parts of the body an asymmetry which is further heightened by the different sized lobes of the caudal fin. The head of the fish tapers to a pointed snout, with the large eye having a well-developed posterior adipose eyelid. The teeth of the fish are a major diagnostic feature of the species, with the upper jaw having two irregular rows of small conical teeth at the front of the mouth, transitioning to a paving of blunt teeth at the back. The lower jaw is similar, having two rows of short conical teeth in the front of the jaw changing to one row of blunter teeth further back. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first containing eight weak spines while the second consists of a single spine followed by 23 to 26 soft rays. The anal fin has two detached spines anterior to the main section, which consists of a single spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays. The upper caudal fin lobe is larger than the lower lobe, whilst the pelvic fin is quite small in comparison to those of other carangids. The lateral line is strongly arched anteriorally, with the arched and straight sections of the line intersecting below the fourth to sixth soft dorsal rays. The curved section of the line contains 32 to 46 scales and up to 2 scutes, while the straight section consists of 35 to 45 scutes and up to 2 scales. The species has 24 vertebrae and a total of 38 to 44 gill rakers. It is a fairly small fish compared to most carangids, only known to reach 16 cm in length. Whilst alive, the razorbelly scad is a bluish grey to greenish grey on the upper body, becoming lighter and more silvery ventrally. Dark vertical bands are sometimes present on the body above the lateral line, and a large black spot is present on the upper operculum and surrounding shoulder region. The fins are pale to hyaline with the exception of the caudal fin which is yellow to dusky in colour, with the upper lobe generally brighter and having a narrow dusky edge. Distribution and habitat The razorbelly scad is broadly distributed over the tropical Eastern Indo-West Pacific region, not as widely distributed as most of the genus Alepes. The species has been recorded from the Red Sea in the west, but is rarely found west of Pakistan. It is common along the Indian, Sri Lankan and South East Asian coasts, extending throughout Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan, reaching as far north as Japan and as far south as northern Australia. As Caranx kalla, the species was recorded at least once in the Mediterranean Sea, passing through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea as part of the Lessepsian migration. The species inhabits inshore coastal environments, especially reef habitats. Biology and fishery Illustration of the razorbelly scadThe razorbelly scad is a predatory fish, whose feeding activity changes, at least in some regions, over the course of a year. A 1988 study in Indian waters found that the species is an active feeder during February and March, showing only moderate activity for the rest of the year. Their main prey items were small crustaceans, particularly copepods and small or larval fish, with smaller amounts of Lucifer, prawns, amphipods and fish eggs taken. Reproduction and spawning in the species has been studied only in Indian waters, where razorbelly scad spawn in a single event from January to September, with peaks in February and in June to August. The eggs are pelagic, spherical and transparent, measuring 0.58 to 0.61 mm in diameter. Newly hatched larvae are 1.13 mm in diameter, and the developmental biology of the larvae has been well studied. The fecundity of the species has been shown to be correlated with total length and body weight. The growth of razorbelly scad was also studied off the Indian coast near Mangalore. It was found the species grows to 83‚Äì84 mm in its first year, 131 mm in the second and 143 mm in the third year of its life. From the data collected, the growth curve predicts a maximum size of 17.1 cm, although it would require a long lifespan. Each sex reaches sexual maturity at a different size, in males it is 128.5 mm and 126.5 mm in females. The species is commonly taken as part of a number of fisheries, although catch data is not available. It is taken by methods including hook and line, gill nets as well as other subsistence fishing gear. Razorbelly scad is marketed fresh and dried salted.

He played in the Australian New South Wales Rugby League premiership and also represented for NSW Country, New South Wales Origin and Australia. Dorahy later played and coached in the English Championship, and coached in the Super League. He began his playing career at and in later years moved into the s. As coach of Wigan, he is one of a select few to have a guided his club to the league championship and Challenge Cup 'double'. Playing career Starting out as a fullback for Wests Wollongong in 1971, Dorahy won the Illawarra competition in '71 and '72 and was selected to represent for NSW Country in '72 and '73 before moving to England. With his cousin, Tony, Dorahy had a year playing league in England with the Leigh club before returning to Australia and a contract with Western Suburbs Magpies in 1974. In 102 games with Wests from 1974 to 1979, Dorahy earned a reputation for his kick and chase and solid defence. He obtained his nickname Joe Cool due to his calm attitude under pressure. In 1980, Dorahy moved to Manly but was only able to play 26 matches over the two seasons due to knee and neck injuries. In 1982, a combined team from the South Coast was admitted to the New South Wales Rugby League premiership competition. Dorahy returned to Wollongong to captain the new team, the Illawarra Steelers, in its d√©but year. Over his four seasons with the club, Dorahy scored 463 points (taking the club record for most goals in a season with 76 1983), but despite a promising season for the club in 1984 under young coach Brian Smith, off the field financial realities of the times hit hard, with players seeking employment outside the Steel city and the Steelers finished with the wooden spoon in the 1985 competition. Dorahy returned to England at the end of the 1983 NSWRL season and played during the northern winter for Hull Kingston Rovers. He was a member of the Championship premiership winning side, defeating Castleford 18-10 in the final at Headingley Stadium. The Harry Sunderland Trophy was awarded to Dorahy as Man of the Match. Dorahy played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored 5-conversions in Hull Kingston Rovers' 22‚Äì18 victory over Castleford in the 1985 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1985‚Äì86 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Sunday 27 October 1985. Dorahy played left-, i.e. number 4, in Hull Kingston Rovers' 8‚Äì11 defeat by Wigan in the 1985‚Äì86 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1985‚Äì86 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 11 January 1986. Leaving Illawarra at the conclusion of their disappointing 1985 season, Dorahy spent a further two seasons with Hull Kingston Rovers. Dorahy played , and scored a conversion in Hull Kingston Rovers' 14‚Äì15 defeat by Castleford in the 1984 Challenge Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Wembley Stadium, London, on Saturday 3 May 1986, in front of a crowd of 82,134. In 1987, at an age when most players would be considering retirement, he returned to Australia and took up the fullback position at Norths, playing his first game with them in round 10. In 1989, Dorahy was on the move again, taking up a position as captain-coach of Halifax during the 1989-1990 season. It was his last season as a professional player and the beginning of his career in coaching. Dorahy played , and was captain in Halifax' 12‚Äì24 defeat by Wigan in the 1989‚Äì90 Regal Trophy Final during the 1989‚Äì90 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 13 January 1990. Dorahy did play again in 2004, as part of the Rugby League Sevens tournament's Men of League team, alongside other retirees including Brett Kenny, \\"Mary\\" McGregor, Allan Langer and Russell Fairfax in an exhibition match. Representative career In 1978 Dorahy was selected for the Australian national side for a two-test series against New Zealand but injury kept him out of the 1978 Kangaroo tour later in the year. In 1979, Dorahy was selected as a centre for two New South Wales matches, one against the touring Great Britain team. Dorahy landed four goals on that occasion but the Blues lost by 19-17 after leading 12-1 at half- time. When Country Origin fullback, Garry Jack, was suspended and pulled from the team in 1988, John Dorahy was called up to replace him. Dorahy's original Country selection had been in 1972, a span of sixteen years between games. Dorahy (along with Ricky Walford, 1990, and Chris Hicks, 2001) holds the record for points scored in a City vs Country Origin match, with fourteen points scored in the 1988 game. Coaching career Dorahy has had two appointments as head coach at first-grade level, both in England and both ending after a relatively short term. In June 1993, Dorahy took on his first head coach role after accepting the position at Wigan, succeeding John Monie. Dorahy was the coach in Wigan' 12‚Äì24 defeat by Castleford in the 1993‚Äì94 Regal Trophy Final during the 1993‚Äì94 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 22 January 1994. Despite supervising Wigan through to the Challenge Cup, Championship and the Premiership, Dorahy was dismissed in May 1994, only days after the club's return from Wembley. In a statement by the club, Dorahy was said to have been sacked for \\"gross misconduct\\". While describing his sacking as \\"diabolical\\", Dorahy admitted there were signs of unrest with rumours of his lack of popularity amongst the players and the appointment of Dean Bell, the club captain, to a coaching assistant's role the previous month. Dorahy's stint at Warrington in 1996-1997 was less successful, as far as match results were concerned, than at Wigan, with Warrington sitting on the bottom of the Super League ladder. Dorahy resigned in March 1997, before the end of the season. In Australia, Dorahy was an assistant coach at the Newcastle Knights from 1991-1993 under David Waite and at the Western Reds from 1995-1996 under Peter Mulholland. In December 2005, Dorahy was appointed coach of the Western Suburbs Magpies premier league team. Recognition In 2004, Dorahy was nominated for the Wests Magpies Team of the Century, finishing with a position on the bench next to Tom Raudonikis. The Illawarra Steelers announced the Team of Steel as part of their 25th anniversary celebrations in 2006 with Dorahy as captain and fullback. While he didn't make the final team, Dorahy was nominated for a position at centre in the Wests Tigers (combined Western Suburbs Magpies and Balmain Tigers teams) Team of the Century in 2007. Dorahy is the father of Dane Dorahy who is also a former professional rugby league footballer. Business career Dorahy has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Wests Illawarra Leagues Club since 2001. Dorahy has also been a director of Leagues Clubs Australia. Dorahy has been significantly involved in the poker machine and hotels industry. He has held positions from Sales Manager at Stargames to Business Development Director at Nanoptix and Aristocrat. He is currently Business Development Director at CashCode, a poker machine parts manufacturer. Political career On 31 October 2010, the NSW Liberal Party confirmed that Dorahy would be the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Keira at the March 2011 NSW State Election. He was unsuccessful. However, despite changing Keira from a safe ALP seat to a marginal ALP seat, Dorahy did not contest the seat again at the 2015 election. He also contested the September 2011 Wollongong City Council election, where he was elected to represent Wollongong's Ward 2, and was elected to be Deputy Lord Mayor for two terms (2012‚Äì13 and 2015‚Äì17). Dorahy was re-elected for a three-year term as a councillor for Ward 2 at the council election held on 9 September 2017.

He was living in London during 1815-1820 and 1823-1840. There he published The Inquisition unmasked (1816), translation of the book that had caused his exile from Spain. Biography Puigblanch was born in Matar√≥ (Barcelona, Spain) on February 3, 1775; son of Antoni Puig Bunyol and Cec√≠lia Blanch. Being a child he studied in the School of Santa Ana of the Escolapios (Matar√≥). Later, he was in the carthusian monastery of Montalegre, but for a short time. In 1799 he travelled to Madrid to continue his studies: Philosophy in the College of Santo Tom√°s de Aquino and ecclesiastic discipline in the Reales Estudios de San Isidro. In 1807 he won the post of professor of Hebrew in the University of Alcal√° de Henares. At this time he publishes Elementos de lengua hebrea (Elements of Hebrew language), where he gathers Francesc Orchell's theories. During the Spanish War of Independence against the French invasion (1808‚Äì1814) the representatives of the Spanish Government escaped to Seville and then to C√°diz. At this time Puigblanch stands out among the liberals, who take advantage of the exceptional circumstances to make political reforms. He defends strongly the abolition of the Inquisition, and he shows his arguments publishing La Inquisici√≥n sin m√°scara (C√°diz, 1811‚Äì1813). For this reason, after the return of the king Fernando VII, Puigblanch has to leave Spain in 1815. He establishes in London. There he publishes the English (revised) edition of his polemic book: The Inquisition Unmasked (1816). He begins to write a poem in Catalan about the fight for the freedom, personified in the Castilian War of the Communities (1520‚Äì1522), entitled Las Comunitats de Castella. By this Catalan poem, Puigblanch is recognized as the predecessor of the cultural movement called Renaixen√ßa. In 1820-1823 Puigblanch was again in Spain, thanks to the political circumstances (Trienio Liberal). He was member of the Spanish Parliament for Catalonia. In 1823 he returned to London for good, where he was employed at a press and at a pastry shop. In addition, he gave lessons of Spanish and French. In 1828 and 1834 he published Op√∫sculos gram√°tico-sat√≠ricos, in which among many other themes, he defends the possibility of constructing a federal Spanish State. He translated to Spanish the Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind by Thomas Brown, entitled Filosof√≠a del esp√≠ritu humano en cien lecciones (1828) and a selection of Sermons by Robert Hall (1764‚Äì1831) entitled Sermones entresacados de los que escribi√≥ en idioma ingl√©s el Rdo. Roberto Hall (1832). He left unfinished and unpublished the translation of the Histoire de Gil Blas de Santillane, by Alain-Ren√© Lesage.

Scarratt joined Shrewsbury Town from his hometown team Wellington Town, and was to play for Shrewsbury for eight seasons prior to World War I. Scarratt is credited as being the first ever goalscorer at Shrewsbury's former Gay Meadow home, scoring an own goal in the first ever known game, a practice match between the 'Reds' and the 'Whites' on 20 August 1910. He made amends for this shortly after on 10 September, in Shrewsbury Town's first match at Gay Meadow, versus Wolverhampton Wanderers Reserves. Whilst Shrewsbury lost 2‚Äì1, Scarratt scored in the right end and became the first Shrewsbury Town player to score at Gay Meadow. During his eight-season spell at Gay Meadow, Scarratt played in every position, including goalkeeper. His Shrewsbury career was ended by World War I, when he served in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. Having survived the war, he is not believed to have returned to football, instead he emigrated to New York City to find work as a builder. He returned to Shropshire in 1930 (possibly as a result of the Great Depression) and settled in his hometown of Wellington before dying in 1958, aged 80.

The anonymous author of the Muratorian canon considered spurious the letters claiming to have Paul as author, and that claim to be written to the Laodiceans and this one to the Alexandrians, which are specifically said to be \\"forged in Paul's name to [further] the heresy of Marcion.\\" Theologian Theodor Zahn believed himself to have found a fragment of the Epistle to the Alexandrians in the shape of a lesson ‚Äì a liturgical Epistle ‚Äì in the (eighth century) Sacramentary and Lectionary of Bobbio (Paris Bib cat., Lat. 13246). It is headed Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians, but it is not from that letter or any other known Pauline epistle. Other scholars consider that it is simply an alternative title to the Epistle to the Hebrews, but they have been unable to convince their colleagues. M. R. James argued that the word 'fincte' might be a scribal error, as many others in the Muratorian Fragment, and that it should be singular instead of plural, and so only the letter to the Alexandrians should be associated with the Marcionites, not the one to the Laodiceans. Joseph Lightfoot suggested there was hiatus after 'Pauli nomine', and that 'fincte' does not apply to the epistles to the Laodiceans nor the Alexandrians, but to mutilated epistles of Marcion, so that the author considered neither to be a forgery.

It is situated approximately to the north east of the city centre. It borders Courthouse Green to the north, Wyken to the east and Stoke to the south with its western edge demarcated by the A444. History and development The area merited no special mention in medieval records and seems to have been open country and grazing land held by the manors of Wyken and Caludon until the late 17th century. The civil parish of Stoke Heath, created out of in the west of Wyken in 1920, became part of Coventry in 1928. The city of Coventry's population expanded by 90,000 in 1928 due to significant boundary changes. Prior to that date, the district seems to have been referred to as 'Wyken Heath' or 'Wyken Knob'. A vague reference to a Stoke Common around 1700 being one of the first references.'The City of Coventry: The outlying parts of Coventry: Wyken and Caludon', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 8: The City of Coventry and Borough of Warwick (1969), pp. 119-124. Date accessed: 17 June 2009. Clay and sand for brickmaking were excavated in Stoke Heath in the early 19th century on sites close to the Coventry Canal. But the approaching First World War in 1914 would be a major catalyst in Stoke Heath's development. The district was built up between 1900 and 1920 and was closely tied into the need for munitions workers during the era of Anglo-German rivalry. During the First World War, Stoke Heath played host to a significant population of Belgian refugees. The area was dominated by the popular red brick Stoke Heath Junior & Infants School, built at the end of 1915. The school provided a central focus for the original 689 homes built by 1915. The school was demolished in the 1990s and a new school erected on the same site. The local parish church is St Albans, Church of England, situated in Mercer Avenue and built in 1929 by the architect Harry Bulkeley Creswell. The original street design for Stoke Heath included large numbers of elm trees, often lining the streets, such as Heath Crescent and Common Way. These became victims of the Dutch elm disease blight which plagued the UK at the end of the 1970s, although the pastoral beginnings of the district are retained in such street names as Blackberry Lane, Little Field, Watersmeet Road and Valley Road. The Morris Motors factory was the chief employer for many decades of the 20th century and at its height covered several acres in Blackberry Lane. The factory initially made copy Hotchkiss car engines, and then munitions during the second world war, before mass-producing engine components for the various incarnations of the Morris Motor Group and British Leyland. The factory met its demise during the recession of the early 1980s and was eventually demolished to make way for new housing at the end of the decade. Another notable landmark was the Barras Pub, well lit and standing back from Heath Crescent. It remained popular with local residents until it too made way for new housing at the turn of the millennium. Due to its proximity to the Morris Engines motor works and numerous factories in Foleshill and Stoke, the area was badly bombed during the Coventry Blitz in November 1940, with dozens of the city's 568 known victims of that air raid being killed in the Stoke Heath area. The last bombs to fall on Coventry during World War II fell on Stoke Heath on 3 August 1942. Anecdotal evidence supports the raid falling on an area stretching from Nuffield Road to upper Valley Road, again aimed at the Morris Engines motor works.Historic Coventry Date accessed 20 June 2009. Coventry Canal, Stoke Heath A small area of the district was home to the notorious \\"HMV\\" (Hillside, Meadway, Valley Road) area of housing owned by Whitefriars Housing Association, but this was demolished during 2003-04.Whitefriars Housing Group Retrieved on 3 June 2008. The notoriety generated by HMV often reflected poorly on the estate, which in most parts was quiet and residential. However, today much of the former site is completely revitalized and rebranded under the name \\"Liberty Park\\". Although in general categorized as an area of \\"struggling families and low income pensioners\\" by such geodemographic surveys as ACORN, the greater Stoke Heath area also contains quite a wide variety of \\"moderate means\\" housing. Areas of private housing increase generally towards Wyken and can also be found along Swancroft Road and off Blackberry Lane. The district is dominated by two large commons; Stoke Heath and Barras Heath. Stoke Heath Common in particular was a noted sports venue for many years with four full sized soccer pitches up to 2000. In the 1920s Stoke Heath, like many city parks became a 'war memorial park' with commemorative plaques inscribed with the names of fallen serviceman situated beneath each tree. These were gradually damaged or removed due to municipal developments. Both parks are now given over to general leisure activities. A memorial obelisk was erected in 1933 to commemorate the work of the conservators of the Stoke Commons who helped keep the areas free of development.Nicholson, Jean et al: The Obelisks of Warwickshire, page 66. Brewin Books, 2013 A canal boat wharf exists in Swan Lane, along the route of the Coventry Canal, with further development planned for the site in 2009/10. The A444 north-south road greatly improved commuting times between Stoke Heath and the city centre from 2000. The area has a popular community centre. Barras Heath and Courthouse Green Residents closer to Barras Heath Common, with its petrol garage, working men's club and high rise block 'Alpha House', can colloquially refer to the area as 'Barras Heath' or 'Barras Green'; although technically this is not a recognised sub-district of the city. A well known wholesale market once stood on the edge of Barras Heath until it made way for modern warehousing units. The route of Clay Lane, which emerges onto Barras Green road and then Mercer Avenue has medieval origins. At the other end of the district, in the Blackberry Lane area, another blurring of names can take place where the name Courthouse Green, a neighbouring estate, is often used interchangeably with Stoke Heath. Alpha House is a prominent 17 storey accommodation block also known as 'Jackblock flats'. Built in 1962 by Costain, it was the first example of advanced 'Jackblock' construction. Under the system, the ground-floor slab was cast first and acted as a casting bed for the 17 floors and the roof. Once contractors had completed each floor, they jacked them up a full storey in height at a speed of half a metre per hour.\\"Frank-Haslam-Milan-saves-one-of-Coventry's-last-jack-block-towers\\" Date accessed 20 June 2009.

Since the inception of the office, the GSOC had sent nine files to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), five of which the director decided not to proceed with prosecution. A decision on the other four were pending.Annual Report, 2007 Corrib gas controversy Because of the large number of complaints in 2007 from County Mayo, arising from protests linked to the Corrib gas controversy, the Commission wrote to then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Brian Lenihan requesting a review of how the protests were policed under section 106 of the Garda S√≠och√°na Act. The minister said he \\"did not feel it was appropriate to proceed\\".Irish Times, 16 May 2008 His successor Dermot Ahern gave a similar answer in the D√°il when the request was repeated by Sinn F√©in two months later. The GSOC recommended that disciplinary action be taken against an unnamed senior member of the Garda S√≠och√°na in relation to the handling of a Shell to Sea protest in north Mayo. The GSOC investigation was undertaken under section 95 of the Garda S√≠och√°na Act, 2005, after receipt of complaints over Garda handling of a protest at Pollathomas pier in June 2007. Some 20 civilians and two Garda√≠ were injured when a landowner objected to trespass on his property by contractors for Shell EP Ireland. Some 68 Garda√≠ were contacted by the GSOC, a move criticised by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. The GSOC had received up to October 2009 a total of 111 complaints in regard to policing of the protests, of which 78 were deemed admissible. The DPP was sent seven files but did not authorise criminal prosecution of Garda√≠ in any of the seven cases. =2008= In 2008, a total of 4,227 allegations arose from 2,681 complaints. Allegations of abuse of authority, neglect of duty and discourtesy constituted 75 per cent of complaints received. Assault accounted for 13 per cent. A total of 1,360 allegations were deemed inadmissible. The 2008 report revealed that 31 files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), identifying 44 potential defendants. The DPP gave 11 directions for prosecution. One Garda was convicted of dangerous driving, arising from a GSOC investigation of an incident in 2007. Ten others were awaiting court dates at the end of 2008, the report said. The DPP gave 30 directions for no prosecution. The GSOC received 129 referrals from the Garda Commissioner, in cases in which it appeared to the commissioner that the conduct of a Garda may have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, a person. =2011= In February 2011 the Commission rejected allegations by the Garda Representative Association that it behaved in an \\"excessive and oppressive\\" manner when gathering evidence in the case of a Garda who was charged with assault. =2012= In December 2012, the GSOC exercised its powers of arrest for the first time, detaining a County Galway Garda for questioning in relation to an allegation of sexual assault.\\"Garda watchdog makes its first arrest\\", The Irish News, 12 December 2012 =2014= In March 2014, the GSOC was reported to be investigating a case in which a mother-of-one, who was viciously assaulted in Galway, says a Garda lied to her about the scheduling of a number of court dates for the case. In May 2014, the GSOC was reported to be investigating the death of a teenager whose body was found in a stream close to the Sallybrook estate of garda superintendent Michael Leacy in Dungarvan, County Waterford. The boy, who was reported to have \\"received injuries\\", was described as \\"a quiet young lad\\" who \\"loved music and football, like any lad\\" and who was \\"doing a course in sports and recreation\\" at the time of his death. In May 2014, the GSOC was reported to be investigating a fatal car crash which occurred after Garda√≠ followed a car in Dublin. Surveillance controversy On Sunday 9 February 2014, the Irish edition of The Sunday Times led with a story written by journalist John Mooney. In it he outlined how the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission had suspected that it was under surveillance. Mooney explained how GSOC had hired the services of a UK counter-surveillance firm, Verrimus, to investigate. A briefing, given to Justice Minister Alan Shatter was subsequently leaked to the media, outlining the investigation. =2015= The chairman of GSOC, Simon O'Brien, resigned his job from 30 January to take up a position with the Pensions Ombudsman Service in the UK. There had been calls for his resignation by Alan Shatter and representatives of the 1,000 rank-and-file Garda√≠ based in Dublin's South Central Division over the Surveillance controversy. In March 2015, \\"based on the level of public disquiet it generated\\" it was announced that GSOC would investigate an incident whereby a homeless man was handcuffed, pepper sprayed and trampled on by a Garda on Henry Street. In November 2015, footage emerged of a civilian being attacked with a police baton in County Wexford. The matter was referred to GSOC. In the same month a young man died while in police custody at Dublin Airport. The matter was also referred to GSOC. =2016= In February 2016, it was reported that the wife of former garda press officer Superintendent David Taylor made a complaint to GSOC over a failure to preserve evidence. In May 2016, the Irish Examiner reported that GSOC queried the independence of the inquiry that produced the Guerin Report and attempted to have it extend its timeframe of investigation so as to complete its work more thoroughly.

Entrance requirements also became more stringent.Gosier, Chris, \\"Wright Tech changes postponed for a year\\", article, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, November 16, 2007, accessed via newsbank.com on January 4, 2008 A $41 million plan to renovate the school, including upgrading classrooms and improving technology, was postponed in 2007 because, state officials said, vocational schools in Groton and Norwich were found to be in more urgent need of the money. The renovation plans included upgrading all classrooms, installing air conditioning, and providing new technology for the culinary arts, auto repair and other programs. An expanded library and a new two-story atrium at the front entrance are also a part of the plan. =Proposal to change to a two-year training center= In November 2007, the state Board of Education was ready to transform the high school into a training center (or \\"career academy\\") where students would transfer as juniors or seniors for a year or two of training and receive their diplomas from their hometown high schools. The Bristol Technical Education Center is the only technical school in the state to follow that model, and state education officials pointed to increased enrollment at that school while enrollment is down at Wright Tech. High school graduates also attend the school for training, although most students there are still in high school.Gosier, Chris, \\"Wright Tech faces change: Task force looks to Bristol model\\", article, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, December 24, 2007, accessed via newsbank.com on January 4, 2008 A decision was postponed for a year after an outcry from backers of Wright Tech, including some state legislators, local business people, alumni, and Lt. Gov. Michael Fedele of Stamford. Some said they feared the change would be disastrous for the school because few teenagers would want to change from taking classes at high school to taking them at Wright Tech starting in the 11th grade. Wright Tech is expected to reopen as a traditional four-year technical high school, offering eight trades. Closure and Reopening Operations of the school were suspended in 2009 Connecticut Department of Education Suspends Operations at J.M. Wright Technical High School due to budgetary restrictions compounded by dismal enrollment and achievement figures. However, local and state lobbying efforts led a discussion to reopen the school. \\"We fought successfully to reopen Wright Tech and we continue to fight for increased funding to ensure its success,\\" said state Sen. Carlo Leone, D-27. Wright Tech was expected to reopen for the fall of 2014CTtech ‚Äì School Information following renovations and selection of new staff, new curricula, and new students, such that \\"This is effectively going to be the opening of a brand new school.\\" The school will open for ninth graders in 2014, and will add one new class each year until it includes grades nine through 12 by 2018. Trades related to automotive, health, culinary arts and science technologies offer the most popular programs chosen by incoming students. Along with new programs, Wright Tech will receive nearly $5 million in additional state funding from 2015 through 2016, which is expected to boost enrollment by over 300 students and fund 21 new full-time positions and five new part-time positions. Wright Tech has also created partnerships with Connecticut-based companies, which help support the learning process. Partners include WTNH Channel 8 for the school's digital media program and Stamford Hospital for its health technology trades. The goal of these partnerships is to provide students with mentoring, internships, curriculum development and some of the latest technology needed for their chosen fields.

It travels north to south, through the city, along of route.  Operation and Routes  The route has 23 stops, with a further two planned for the future. Two services run on the line: * A This , 21 station service runs from the Neuch√¢tel terminus in the northern Orgeval neighbourhood, to the southern terminus of H√¥pital Debr√©, passing through the city centre, past the railway station and the cathedral. The trams run with five to six minutes frequency. * B : This service follows nearly the same route as A, running from the Neuch√¢tel terminus, through the city centre. A short distance before the terminus of A, it turns 90 degrees and speeds up to reach the Champagne- Ardenne TGV station at Bezannes. The trams run an approximately 22 minute frequency.  Rolling stock  The 18 trams used on the line are Alstom Citadis 302. They consist of five body sections and have capacity for 205 passengers, with 56 seated. The line uses the APS third rail system for 1.9 km around Reims Cathedral, minimising visual intrusion in the historic city centre. This APS system, pioneered in Bordeaux, allows the trams to be powered by a ground level third rail instead of overhead power lines. The vehicle design evokes a Champagne flute, as Reims is the centre of the Champagne region. The livery is the work of famous designer Ruedi Baur and is based around the concept of colours. Each vehicle has its own pastel colour from a total selection of eight. The insides of the vehicles are coloured the same as the outsides.  History  Initial studies into the potential of a tramway began in 2003, as a consequence of an overcrowded bus network and the impacts this was having on the historic centre of Reims. In July 2006, financing, construction and management of the future line was delegated to a private concessionary consortium, called MARS (Mobility in the Agglomeration of ReimS). This ‚Ç¨1.4 billion public private partnership was unique in France at the time. This consortium is composed of the vehicles' builder Alstom, the network operator Transdev, five roadwork enterprises and three pension funds. Construction of the tramway began in May 2008, with the first tram arriving in March 2010, which allowed for testing and commissioning of the line in September 2010. The line opened on 16 April 2011, with a cost of ‚Ç¨305m.

It was involved in the management of sports venues, notably greyhound racing stadia. The GRA was responsible for introducing Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and was the largest racing operator for 70 years but diminished when trading as GRA Acquisition from 2005-2019. Despite its name, it was not involved in the administration of greyhound racing. History=Early racing history= The first meeting Greyhound racing was developed from coursing in 18th-century Britain. The first official coursing club was the Swaffham Coursing Society in Norfolk, England, which put on its first event in 1776. Modern greyhound racing was effectively developed by Owen Patrick Smith, the chamber of commerce director in Hot Springs, South Dakota in the early years of the 20th century. He had been involved in organising local coursing events but did not like the sport, which he felt was inhumane. He began to look for a way to make the sport less bloody by using an artificial lure. After much trial and error, Smith attracted investors and perfected an artificial lure system in 1912. His tracks allowed for six greyhounds to race at a time, and were circular instead of straight. Although it took some time for the concept to be fully developed and put into practice, by the 1920s, his greyhound racing tracks were spread across the USA and attracted thousands of visitors. =Formation of GRA= Alfred Critchley Modern greyhound racing was developed in England by the GRA. American businessman Charles A. Munn had secured the rights from Smith for artificial-lure racing in England in the early 1920s. With three others - Brigadier-General Alfred Critchley, a Canadian-born World War I flying veteran, Major L Lyne Dixson, a noted coursing judge; and Sir William Gentle, a retired chief constable - he formed the Greyhound Racing Association Trust Ltd in August 1925. Although Gentle was the first company chairman, it was Critchley who took control of the company as managing director, and provided the energy and vision to drive it forward. The other directors were Robert Grant Jr., Francis Steward Gentle, F A Lumley, Henry Haworth Hardman and Charles A Munn. The North West of England was chosen to introduce the sport to the country, most likely hoping that the area's coursing tradition would make it attractive to the local population. On 14 October 1925 the association took a seven-year lease on land at the northern end of Kirkmanshulme Lane (an old brickfield), Manchester at an annual rent of ¬£276, leased from the adjacent Belle Vue Zoological Gardens.The Guardian, Page 13, April 1st, 1926 With capital of ¬£22,000, ¬£8,000 of which was borrowed, Belle Vue Stadium was built on the land. The stadium opened on 27 July. Although the attendance at the first meeting was disappointing, by the end of the first season in October, thirty seven meetings had been held, with an average attendance of 11,000. =UK expansion= In 1927, Greyhound racing was taken to London with the acquisition of the near-derelict White City Stadium. GRA also moved its headquarters from Belle Vue to White City at the same time. The GRA financed its activities by employing the then sophisticated automatic totalisator betting system developed by the British-born but long time Australian resident (the concept of Australian citizenship does date earlier than from the 1970s) George Alfred Julius. The company's sophisticated commercial structure was quickly evident. From the earliest a complex set of subsidiaries and joint holdings characterised the company structure. The ownership of the Belle Vue track was actually in the hands of a subsidiary, Greyhound Racing Trust (Manchester) Ltd. In many cases Critchley and his co-directors owned a controlling or significant interest in these subsidiaries. By the end of 1927 the company had acquired an interest in 18 racing tracks.The Guardian, Page 15, November 21st, 1927 Its relationship to many of these tracks was affiliation, rather than full ownership.The Guardian, Page 16, November 16th, 1927 Nonetheless, in November 1927, just two years after the company was formed they were able to report that 4,500,000 people had passed through their turnstiles giving gross receipts of ¬£500,000. In the same month the company was approaching its shareholders with plans to take the company public. To effect this plan a new entity, The Greyhound Racing Trust Ltd, was formed. Whilst Critchley and Munn were still directors of this new company, Lyne Dixson no longer featured and Gentle had been replaced by Major General, the Lord Loch, as chairman. The new company issued its prospectus in December of the same year. Diversification also came quite early in the company's history as they quickly adapted their venues for use as speedway tracks. In 1936 it diversified further by acquiring land next to its stadium in Harringay, north London and building the short-lived Harringay Arena. The first major challenge for the company came with the 1934 Betting Act which stipulated that greyhound tracks must plan their programme a year in advance and hold no more than 104 meeting a year (two a week). It also required that tracks in the same neighbourhood must hold their meetings on the same evening. Nonetheless, given the novelty of the sport the GRA, and the industry in general, was able to weather both this and the disruption brought about by World War II. During 1942, Alfred Critchley became the Chairman in place of the late Edward Loch, 2nd Baron Loch. =Post-war development= The popularity of greyhound racing boomed in the post-war years, with 25 million people passing through the turnstiles nationwide each year.Business Observer, Page 12, February 15th, 1970. The sport peaked in 1946, with White City alone recording a turnover of ¬£17,576,190. The 1960 Betting and Gaming Act heralded the end of the sport's popularity. The Act allowed alternatives to track-betting including bingo halls, casinos and betting shops. The development of high street betting meant that people could now bet without having to visit tracks. The Act also subjected greyhound track operators and the Greyhound Tote to much higher tax rates than betting shops. By the end of the decade attendances had declined to 10 million visitors a year. Although this meant that greyhound racing was still the country's second most popular sport after football, it was a dramatic decline on attendances after the war. In 1957 Laddie Lucas became the Managing Director of replacing Francis Gentle who remained as Chairman of the company. Presaged by the sale of the Harringay Arena in 1958, the company soon moved to support it share price in the face of falling attendance by focusing the market on the value of its property portfolio. In 1965 John Sutton became Managing Director and the GRA extended its board by adding Major Percy Brown, John Cearns (son of WJ Cearns) and Charles Chandler Jr. to the directors but sold the Kingsfurze breeding establishment at Naas in County Kildare, the seven acre grounds had been breeding greyhounds for over 17 years. They then sold Upper Childown Farm and Fan Court Farm grounds in Longcross near Chertsey. The two properties were used as a nursery and rearing establishment by the GRA. Further cutbacks by the GRA included the sacking of two advertising executives and five trainers from the Hook Estate and Kennels. In the summer of 1969 it traded as the Greyhound Racing Property Trust. This move, together with a contemporaneous improvement of tax conditions for the industry by Chancellor Jim Callaghan, saw the GRA's share price improve dramatically. The GRA's strategy was to buy up tracks which raised the value of the company's stock and to sell when the price of property boomed. They sold six tracks from 1970-1974 (Charlton, Kings Heath, West Ham, Reading, Liverpool and Clapton) and had previously agreed the sale of their flagship track White City. Foreseeing that industry rationalisation would be required, the company embarked on a strategy that would allow them to control this phase, buying up competing tracks. As part of this spate of buying, in March 1972, GRA Property Trust acquired Wimbledon Stadium, later its flagship venue. Despite the track sales the company secured various loans and also began to apply for planning permission of some of its London sites to secure their development value. However, a slump in the property market caused shares in property companies to free-fall. At the beginning of 1975 GRA Property Trust was suspended from the Stock Exchange following news of debts said to be in the region of ¬£20 million. The management of the company during this period was inept, the assets were sold but they still accumulated debts of ¬£18.4 million. A scheme of arrangement was organised in 1976 in order to avoid liquidation. They then sold their third share in Walthamstow and their 23% stake in Coral. The company survived in part through 1980s sale of a number of leading GRA venues, including White City, Slough, Shawfield, Harringay, and Powderhall. In 1987 GRA was the subject of a ¬£68.5 million reverse takeover by Wembley Stadium. Wembley assumed control of GRA and in February 1988 the GRA Group was renamed Wembley plc.

One of the most prominent refuseniks in the Soviet Union, he was the 16th Speaker of the Knesset from 2013 until his resignation on 25 March 2020. Early life Yuli Edelstein was born in Chernivtsi in the Soviet Union (now Ukraine) to a Jewish family. His mother, Anita Edelstein, was Jewish, while his father, Yuri Edelstein, is the son of a Jewish father and Christian mother. Both converted to Christianity, and Yuri is now a Russian Orthodox priest in Karabanovo of Kostroma Oblast named Father Georgy. While his parents taught at universities in the countryside, Edelstein was raised by his maternal grandparents. His grandfather had taught himself Hebrew at the age of 70 and used to listen to the Voice of Israel on a shortwave radio. When Edelstein's grandfather died, Yuli began to study Hebrew and read books such as Exodus by Leon Uris, which inspired him. In 1977, during his second year of university, Edelstein applied for an exit visa to immigrate to Israel. Turned down, he began to associate with a small group of Hebrew teachers who held classes in their apartments. One of Edelstein's students was refusenik Alexander Smukler. In 1979, he was expelled from the university and suffered harassment by the KGB and local police. During this time, he found odd jobs as a street cleaner, security guard, and more. In 1984, he and other Hebrew teachers were arrested on fabricated charges, Edelstein himself being charged with possession of drugs,Encyclopaedia Judaica Year Book. 1986. p.366\\"When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone: The Epic Struggle to Save Soviet Jewry\\".

He was then sent to Siberian penal colonies and did hard labor, first in Buryatia and then in Novosibirsk. He broke several bones after falling from a construction tower. He was due to be transferred back to Buryatia, but his wife, Tanya, threatened to go on hunger strike if he was returned there. Edelstein was released in May 1987, on the eve of Israeli Independence Day, the next to last of the refuseniks to be freed. He then immigrated to Israel, moving to the West Bank settlement of Alon Shvut. He did his national service in the Israel Defense Forces, attaining the rank of Corporal.Particulars Knesset Political career Edelstein as Information Minister, briefing reporters at site of Hamas rocket attack, 2012 Initially a member of the National Religious Party and a vice-president of Zionist Forum, Edelstein founded the Yisrael BaAliyah party together with fellow Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky. He was elected to the Knesset in 1996, and was appointed Minister of Immigrant Absorption in Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud-led government. He was re-elected in 1999, and was appointed Deputy Immigrant Absorption Minister by Ariel Sharon in 2001. He retained his seat in the 2003 elections, shortly after which Yisrael BaAliyah merged into Likud. Although Edelstein lost his seat in the 2006 elections, in which Likud was reduced to 12 seats (Edelstein was 14th on the party's list), he re-entered the Knesset as a replacement for Dan Naveh in February 2007. He retained his seat in the 2009 elections after being placed twelfth on the party's list, and was appointed Minister of Information and Diaspora in the Netanyahu government. Following the 2013 elections, he became Speaker of the Knesset. On 25 March 2020, he stepped down as the Speaker.https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5701258,00.html Statements In December 2014, in an interview with The Jerusalem Post, Edelstein warned world leaders against creating a Palestinian state that he thought would go to war with Israel. In the same interview, Edelstein stated that he believes in Israeli-Palestinian coexistence. In 2014, he was one of several Members of the Knesset (MK) who submitted complaints against Arab- Israeli Haneen Zoabi for supporting Hamas, which led to her six-month suspension. \\"I have been in the Knesset for almost 19 years,\\" Edelstein said. \\"I remember Arab MKs joining me at the March of the Living and proposing social-oriented legislation with me. That is definitely not Zoabi. I believe in coexistence and fighting against those who harm it and I think that Zoabi‚Äôs words and actions hurt coexistence. People hear her and think all Arabs must hate us and want to kill us. That is unhealthy, and we have to put an end to it.‚Äù Edelstein criticized Jewish U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for saying that U.S. military aid to Israel should instead be diverted toward humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Edelstein said that Sanders should 'stop talking nonsense'. Personal life After leaving Alon Shvut, Edelstein moved to Neve Daniel, another West Bank settlement. He was married to Tatiana (Tanya) Edelstein, who was a Zionist activist, for 33 years. They met in the Soviet Union when she attended a Hebrew class he was teaching. After immigrating to Israel, she worked as a civil engineer at the Civil Aviation Authority. Tanya and Yuli Edelstein had two children together. In 2014, Tanya died of cancer at the age of 63. In June 2016, Edelstein married Irina Nevzlin, chair of the board of directors of The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot and President of the NADAV Foundation.  Criticism  The long-term project of subsidizing housing for elderly migrants prepared by Israel Ministry of Absorption under his supervision and cooperation with Ministry of Construction raised controversy over expenditures overrun incurred by the project. Edelstein claimed that the investigative commission found such claims unsubstantiated.–ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—å—é –≠–¥–µ–ª—å—à—Ç–µ–π–Ω–∞ –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–µ NEWSru.co.il:–ü–æ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞–º –¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –≠–¥–µ–ª—å—à—Ç–µ–π–Ω–∞, —Ä–∞–∑–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—ã –æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ä–∞—Å—Ö–æ–¥–µ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ –≥–æ–¥—ã, –Ω–æ –¥–≤–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä—è—é—â–∏–µ –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏–∏ –Ω–µ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∏ —ç—Ç–∏ —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, —Ö–æ—Ç—è —ç—Ç–∏ –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏–∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ ¬´–ú–∏–∫–±–∞—Ü–µ–π –¥–∏—é—Ä¬ª.

It was founded in 1865 by Alfred Nobel. Creation After the death of his younger brother Emil in an 1864 nitroglycerin explosion at the family's armaments factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Nobel founded Nitroglycerin AB in Vinterviken, Stockholm. A year later, having found some German business partners, he launched the Alfred Nobel & Company in Germany, building an isolated factory in the Kr√ºmmel hills of Geesthacht near Hamburg. This business exported a liquid combination of nitroglycerin and gunpowder known as \\"Blasting Oil\\", but it was extremely unstable and difficult to transport, as shown in numerous catastrophes. The buildings of the Kr√ºmmel factory itself were destroyed in 1866 and again in 1870. In April 1866, the company shipped three unmarked crates of nitroglycerin to California for the Central Pacific Railroad, who wished to experiment with its blasting capability to speed the construction of a tunnel through the Sierra Nevada for the First Transcontinental Railroad. One of the crates exploded, destroying a Wells Fargo office in San Francisco and killing fifteen people, leading to a complete ban on the transport of liquid nitroglycerin in California. Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere as well, and this finally led to Alfred Nobel & Company's development of dynamite in 1867, made by mixing the nitroglycerin with the diatomaceous earth (kieselguhr) found in the Kr√ºmmel hills. Competitors tried to mix nitroglycerin with other inert absorbents in many different combinations to get around Nobel's tightly controlled patents.

At the beginning, the company was manufacturing nitroglycerin explosives in the dynamite factory of Kr√ºmmel located in Geesthacht, near Hamburg. This factory was the first one to be located outside of Sweden. Alfred Nobel Nobel wanted to produce nitroglycerine on several sites in Europe because the transportation of explosives was very dangerous due to its well-known sensitivity to shocks. Because of the danger associated with handling nitroglycerine, Nobel started to develop a more secure explosive commonly known as dynamite. During the experimental stage, a very severe explosion occurred in 1866 within the Kr√ºmmel factory which was nearly destroyed. He was successful in mixing nitroglycerine with Kieselgur which made it less sensitive to shocks. In October 1867, Nobel filed a patent for this new explosive in Sweden, the United States of America and in the United Kingdom (the patent was not filed in Germany before 1877). The new explosive was marketed under the name of security powder. In 1874, in order to ensure a better supply of the main buyers, the mines of the region of Ruhr, the company took over the Schlebusch factory in Manfort (since 1930 a district of Leverkusen; Nobel was involved in its construction since 1872 and supervised the production on a temporary basis. In 1876, Nobel's company became a limited liability company and was renamed Dynamit AG, i.e. DAG). The company started manufacturing defense equipment, and soon afterwards became the biggest manufacturer of powder and ammunitions of the German Reich. In 1884, similar to other European countries, the biggest German powder manufacturers agreed to form a cartel known as named Deutsche Union (or \\"Interessensgemeinschaft\\") which was led by Dynamit Nobel for five years. All the largest manufacturers of powder of the German Reich abided by this union which prevented them from competing against each other due to their cooperation and agreement upon the export prices. In 1886, they approached the English powder cartel, the Nobel Dynamite Trust Co and managed to establish the General cartel made up of both the German and English powder factories. Due to the high demand for defense equipments for the First World War, the manufacturers of powder made very high profits, which were reinforced due to their cartel organization. Furthermore, during this period, the states strongly encouraged the development and production of weapons. In 1886, Dynamit Nobel opened a branch in Troisdorf and as from 1905 this factory also manufactured a plastic material based on nitrocellulose (an explosive product): known as celluloid. Until the start of the First World War, Dynamit Nobel grew by acquiring smaller competitor companies to become the biggest explosive manufacturer in Europe. During the war, it employed prisoners of war in its factory (namely Russian prisoners in the factory of D√∂mitz). Without descendants, Alfred Nobel, decided that after his death his fortune would be used to create the Nobel foundation. This was done in 1900. Each year this foundation awards the Nobel Prize. The fortune of Nobel which was converted into shares that finance the Nobel foundation. = From 1918 to 1945 = Share of the Dynamit AG, vorm. Alfred Nobel & Co., issue August 1928 The old administrative building of the Kr√ºmmel explosive factory. After the end of the war, parts of the factory's facilities were dismantled and after the enforcement of the Versailles treaty, companies were forbidden to manufacture defense equipment. As from then, the company manufactured mostly explosives destined to mines, detonators, ignition systems as well as ammunitions for hunting and sports. The end of the production of the highly profitable defense equipment caused the company to suffer from heavy financial losses. This caused the company to close down some factories while reducing the production capacities in others. In 1923, the company launched the manufacture of plastic parts made of nitrocellulose. Indeed, Dynamit Nobel aimed at reducing its dependence to the defense equipment in order to give more importance to the manufacture of chemical products. In 1925, the Lindener Z√ºndh√ºtchen- und Thoonwaarenfabrik of Empelde was taken over by the Chemische Werke Lothringen GmbH, which itself belonged to BASF. Production was stopped in 1928 and did not restart until the rearmament which occurred in 1938. During the 1920s, the company collaborated closely with the Siegener Dynamitfabrik AG and the Rheinisch-Westf√§lischen Sprengstoff-AG which belonged to I.G. Farben since 1931. In 1926, as a result of the fusion with K√∂ln- Rottweil AG which belonged to I.G. Farben, Dynamit Nobel was taken over by I.G. Farben. As from then, it formed a cartel with Westfalit AG (the forerunner of the WASAG, which was also taken over by I.G. Farben in 1945), which had a monopolistic position on the German powder market. In 1930, the Rheinische Spritzgu√ü-Werk GmbH (today the Dynamit Nobel Kunststoff GmbH) was founded in Cologne. After the national-socialists took lead of the German government, and wished to develop a strong German defense industry, the Wehrmacht explicitly requested bigger ammunition manufacturing capacities. In order to do so, the WASAG and Dynamit Nobel founded the Deutsche Sprengchemie GmbH in 1934. New factories manufacturing explosives and ammunitions were built on government lands and received help from a company which had been nationalized, the Verwertungsgesellschaft f√ºr Mountain-Industrie mbH. Afterwards, the Deutsche Sprengchemie GmbH became the only subsidiary of WASAG. Dynamit Nobel had the same activities in Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH (i.e. Verwertchemie). The latter ran more than 30 factories, namely in Liebenau, Empelde, and Stadtallendorf. At that time, Stadtallendorf was the largest place of ammunition production in Europe. During World War Two, more than people coming from camps managed by the SS were forced to work there. In 1938, a new factory manufacturing nitrocellulose was built in Aschau am Inn. After the war it became the property of WASAG due to the decartelization of I.G. Farben. = From 1945 to 1992 = After World War Two, Dynamit Nobel began manufacturing plastic equipment and ammunition in West Germany but was not able to keep the factories located in the areas occupied by the Soviets. These factories were partly dismembered. From 1953, Dynamit Nobel tried to develop intermediary organic products in order not to rely completely on the plastic equipment. After deciding the rearmament of Bundeswehr, the manufacture of ammunition was restarted in 1957, at first in the factory of Liebenau by the Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH which had survived the war. At the beginning of the 1960s, once again, the company became the leader of the military and civil powder market in Germany, namely due to the takeover of the manufacturer of ammunitions Gustav Genschow & Co. AG de Karlsruhe in 1963. At the same time, Dynamit Nobel took an increasing position in the mines market. Since 1958, around 3 million antitank mines, models DM-11 were manufactured in Liebenau under license of the Swedish company LIAB.Thomas K√ºchenmeister (1995), Deutscher Bundestag p. 30-31 Moreover, in collaboration with B√∂lkow and Dornier, Dynamit Nobel participated to the research projects of the Ministry of nuclear energy (today known as the Federal Ministry of education and research) for the possible supply of Germany with missiles. During the end of the 1950s, Friedrich Karl Flick, who was a board member of the supervisory board before the war, started to monopolize the company to the detriment of the minority shareholders, sometimes by brutal means. Supported by the Bremen speculator Hermann Krages and partly due to the collusive trading of actions with the Feldm√ºhle AG of which Flick was also a shareholder, he managed to obtain the majority of the shares of the company and became the president of the board of directors. As from then, Flick who already possessed 82% of the share capital,made use of the controversial Umwandlungssteuergesetzes (fiscal law regarding commercial companies) in order to squeeze out the minority shareholders of the company, in exchange of a compensation (this tool is comparable to the one used today in order to exclude minority shareholders out of a company). After several groups of shareholders protested against this law put into place under the third Reich, the Federal Constitutional Tribunal gave a judgement in favor of Flick. In 1959, Dynamit AG changed its name to Dynamit Nobel AG, in remembrance of its famous founder. As from 1962, due to the pressure which occurred during the conference, the company which belonged to Flick started to negotiate the compensation to be given to forced Jewish employees who worked in the factory of Troisdorf in 1944 and 1945. After an agreement was made, Friedrich Flick personally blocked the payment of five million Deutsche Mark and no sum of money was released until his death in 1972. In January 1970, Flick made a final statement and declared that he He affirmed that a payment would contradict his previous statements of innocence at the Flick trial and he was unwilling to make a payment to be considered as an admission of guilt. He also affirmed that the Swiss Dieter B√ºhrle (Oerlikon-B√ºhrle) was also a shareholder of Dynamit Nobel, being the owner of 18% of the shares. After Bundeswehr was fully equipped with antitank mines during the late 1960s, the factory of Liebenau was sold in 1977 to the Dutch ammunitions manufacturer Eurometaal, owned by Dynamit Nobel (33% of shares). As from then, the big mines projects were put into place in Troisdorf and in Burbach-W√ºrgendorf. In 1986, the Flick group was bought by Deutsche Bank for an approximate amount of 5.36 billions of DM. The latter restructured the group and sold parts of it while putting the rest of the group on the stock market. Deutsche Bank finally agreed to compensate the forced workers of Dynamit Nobel AG in respect of the conditions established in the 1960s. During the restructuring of Dynamit Nobel AG, a joint-venture was made with two of the companies of the Flick Group, namely Feldm√ºhle AG and Buderus AG and was renamed Feldm√ºhle Nobel AG. In 1986, the new group was introduced on the stock market. In 1988, the grand children of Friedrich Flick (Friedrich Christian Flick and his brother Gert Rudolf Flick) failed to gain control over the Feldm√ºhle Nobel AG. Indeed, in 1992, Metallgesellschaft AG (today known as the GEA Group) took over the company to fraction it again. Shares of Dynamit Nobel AG and Buderus remained the property of Metallgesellschaft, while the pulp and paper division (formerly known as Feldm√ºhle AG) was sold under the name of Feldm√ºhle Nobel AG to the Swedish company Stora (Stora Enso since 1998). As early as 1988, Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH, which had been managed as an affiliate, and Dynamit Nobel put into force an agreement regarding the consolidation and profit transfer In 1990, the subsidiary was merged with another subsidiary, Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff- und Systemtechnik GmbH. = Since 1992 = At the beginning of the 1990s, the company was present in the basic and intermediary chemical products, synthetic fibers, specific chemical products (such as silicon wafers) and the processing of plastic materials (in particular PVC). About one quarter of the turnover of the company originated from the traditional sector of explosives, as well as the ammunition technology which is closely linked to the equipment projects of the Bundeswehr. In 1992, the company took over Cerasiv GmbH and Chemetall GmbH, and in 1994 Sachtleben Chemie GmbH and Chemson GmbH were also taken over. In 1996, the company acquired CeramTec AG which belonged to Hoechst and merged with Cerasiv GmbH under the name of CeramTec Innovative Ceramic Engineering AG. In 1997, Dynamit Nobel took over Phoenix Kunststoff GmbH in order to reinforce its position in the plastic equipments market. In 1999, Dynamit Nobel and the chemical company Solvadis were united within the MG chemical group. The scope of chemical activities within Chemetall was optimized by the acquisition of Cyprus Foote (1998) and Brent (1999), followed by the sale of two subsidiaries namely, Chemson GmbH (1999) and Coventya GmbH (2000). In 2001, the industrial activities of Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff und Systemtechnik GmbH was taken over by Orica. In 2002, the Swiss group RUAG technology took over Dynamit Nobel Ammotec GmbH, which had been separated from Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff und Systemtechnik GmbH. In this company, the production was focused on the manufacture of ammunitions of small calibre. In 2004, MG technologies AG sold its chemical activities to emphasize the manufacture of equipment. Therefore, Dynamit Nobel AG was dismantled and taken over by several companies. The American company Rockwood Specialties Group Inc, the largest buyer, acquired Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Chemetall GmbH, CeramTec Innovative Ceramic Engineering AG and DNSC GmbH as of 31 July 2004 for 2.25 billions of euros through its Luxemburg subsidiary Knight Lux 1 S.A.R.L.. Part of DNSC GmbH remains in Leverkusen and is known as Dynamit Nobel GmbH ES. Rockwood is a chemical holding company that the financial investor company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co had acquired. Dynamit Nobel Kunststoff GmbH was taken over in 2004 by the Swedish company Plastal Holding AB for 915 million euros. The technical armament activity was reduced under the name of Dynamit Nobel Defence GmbH, with the registered office located in W√ºrgendorf (Burbach). The company was specialized in the manufacture of small calibers for the army, official authorities, hunters and shooting sports and was taken over by the Swiss group RUAG in 2002 and merged with its ammunitions branch. Therefore, the former companies Dynamit Nobel Marken RWS, Rottweil and Geco were named RUAG Ammotec GmbH (F√ºrth). The dismantlement of the Nobel group was made in close collaboration with the employees representatives, who were highly involved during the sales negotiations. Indisputably the employees' committee would have preferred that the chemical activity remains within MG technologies AG, but an agreement was reached as Rockwood Inc. certified that the long term interests of the company would be maintained and that all the German employees would keep their jobs.Sieger Reinhold: Wir hatten einen konstruktiven Dialog, \\"Interview du comit√© d'entreprise du groupe et du conseil de surveillance de MG technologies AG\\" from \\"Magazin Mitbestimmung\\" (April 2005), http://www.boeckler.de/163_32323.html  Defence projects since the Second World War  The Minenwurfsystem Skorpion. As from 1958, Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH/Verwertchemie, a subsidiary of Dynamit Nobel manufactured antitank mines of type DM-11 in Liebenau, under license of the Swedish company LIAB. The AT-2 antitank mines were created by Dynamit Nobel and approximately 1.3 millions were manufactured. The Bundeswehr ordered of them for the LARS (a system of light artillery with missiles) which was into place until 2000, about were manufactured for Minenwurfsystem Skorpion (a vehicle which installed mines) and for M270 (a multiple rocket launcher). Between 1981 and 1986, the Bundeswehr invested 564.7 millions of DM in mines projects. Besides the AT-2 antitank mines, Dynamit Nobel developed an antipersonnel mine AP-2, an anti- material mine, a signal mine and a shallow water mine. HK G11, a new assault rifle using an ammunition without casing was developed in collaboration with the weapons manufacturer Heckler & Koch between 1968 and 1990, whereas Dynamit Nobel developed the ammunitions without casing. The project was completed but the Bundeswehr declined it due to financial considerations. Ammunition project 2010: rocket launcher Panzerfaust 3. Dynamit Nobel marketed the Swedish antitank mine FFV 028SN of the company FFV and took charge of the transformation of 125 000 antipersonnel mines, model DM-31 which had been manufactured between 1962 and 1967 by Industriewerke Karlsruhe (today KUKA) which belonged to the Quandt group at the time, in order to enable them to conform to the antitank mines authorized by the Ottawa convention. However, the detonator was not sufficiently modified, and it could therefore be used against people, while it should only have been used against tanks. In respect of an agreement made in 1989, Dynamit Nobel was manufacturing blank cartridge bullets and figure targets in W√ºrgendorf. Dynamit Nobel also agreed to develop the Panzerfaust 3, in order to progressively deliver it to the Bundeswehr and other armies as the priority antitank defense mechanism in the infantry. In 2010, several different types are manufactured for the Bundeswehr.  Polyvinyl chloride poisoning in Troisdorf  Until the 1970s, Dynamit Nobel polymerised the monomer vinyl chloride into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the factory of Troisdorf. At this time, about 130 to 140 employees were regularly in touch with it. In total, about 3600 persons have worked within this division since the launching of the production in Troisdorf in the 1940s. Infringing the health and safety regulations in force at that time, the employees of Dynamit Nobel were exposed for years, with little protection, to this harmful substance which later turned out to be carcinogenic. Therefore, they were heavily contaminated by vinyl chloride gas or by cleaning up the autoclaves. At this time, most of the other manufacturers of PVC had already put into place systems of production, which were less dangerous for the health. The same had not been done at Dynamit Nobel because of financial considerations. Moreover, regular controls were not made, others were partially manipulated or the results were kept secret. Also, the company made an important contribution to the region, regularly obtained extensions of time to apply the regulations. Contamination due to vinyl chloride was so severe that for years in the company, the employees complained of damage relating to the liver, anemia, finger circulation disorder resulting in acro-osteolysis (necrosis of the first phalanxes), as well as headaches and dizziness. Cancers also resulted from the exposure. After the announcement of the first thirteen severe diseases during spring 1972, work inspectors from Bonn ordered Dynamit Nobel to take the appropriate measures in order to improve the health and safety conditions of work. But the company took a long time to put them into place. Afterwards, the 40 sick employees gathered together as Interessengemeinschaft der VC-Gesch√§digten in order to file a complaint for violation of duty against the Land of North-Rhine-Westphalia and asked for damage compensation, just like in the Contergan trial. The local committee of the DKP in Troisdorf filed a complaint for injury and involuntary homicides against the board of directors of Dynamit Nobel AG. Both complaints remained unsuccessful. After more details about the scandal were made public, employees and inhabitants of Troisdorf organized a series of demonstrations. In 1975, the company's board of directors decided to shut down PVC polymerisation workshop to escape the expensive costs related to modernization and security of the plant. Since the first announcement about the existing risks, the company has tried its best to keep things quiet. In that respect, it has put a lot of pressure on journalists and editors. During the following years, some employees were contaminated and died due to their disease without the company ever compensating them.

After his discharge, he returned to Rutgers and ultimately moved on to Temple University, where he completed both his undergraduate and law degrees.Urgo, Jacqueline L. \\"Joseph Lazarow, 84, dies; helped bring casinos to A.C.\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 5, 2008. Accessed January 5, 2008. He had been elected to the City Commission in 1972, and was selected by his peers to serve as mayor in 1976. As mayor, Lazarow was named chairman of the Committee to Rebuild Atlantic City, a group developed to support the passage of the 1976 statewide referendum that approved gambling in New Jersey. He unsuccessfully opposed construction of casinos on the city's four-mile (6 km) long Boardwalk, citing concerns that the area's residents, advocating that the hotels should be cited in unused wetlands on the city's outskirts.\\"ATLANTIC CITY PLAN FOR CASINO OPPOSED; Mayor Vows Fight to Stop Project That Would Displace Tenants Playboy International Rebuffed No Outside Aid Expected\\", The New York Times, July 25, 1978.Janson, Donald. \\"Atlantic City Mayor Warns State Not to Block Casinos on Wetlands\\", The New York Times, May 14, 1977.

Lazarow was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for a July 1977 publicity stunt, in which the mayor shook more than 11,000 hands in a single day, breaking the record previously held by Theodore Roosevelt, who had set the record with 8,513 handshakes at a White House reception on January 1, 1907. He had lived in the city's Lower Chelsea section since the mid-1950s, until the 1993 death of his wife, the former Fredlyn Pogach of Philadelphia. Lazarow moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1995. He died in St. Petersburg, Florida on January 3, 2008 at the age of 84.

Simak, originally published in 1944 in Astounding Science Fiction. It is one of several linked stories collected in City. \\"Huddling Place\\" was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. Plot summary The story is lightly plotted, and most of the text is devoted to setting the scene. In the distant future, man has colonized Mars and lives an apparently easy life, supported by efficient and intelligent robots. Intelligent Martians co-exist with the humans on that planet. The trend to suburbanization, first manifest in the mid-20th century, has continued, such that many (most?) humans on Earth live in isolated enclaves. Jerome Webster, the main character, is a human with expertise in Martian physiology, especially that of the brain. Like many other human adults, he suffers from progressive agoraphobia, which becomes extreme after his only son departs to spend time on Mars. Jenkins, the most senior family robot, explains to Webster that his father had been similarly afflicted. Webster contemplates writing a monograph on the subject. Before he can begin this project, he learns that Juwain, a Martian friend and brilliant philosopher, has contracted a terrible disease that only he can cure. This would require traveling to Mars, something his agoraphobia makes nearly impossible. Senior political figures make clear that Juwain's death would be a tragedy for which mankind would suffer for thousands of years, and Webster is pained by the thought of forsaking his friend. With great effort he packs for the trip, only to discover, in the last lines of the story, that the robot Jenkins, not understanding the stakes, had dismissed the spaceship that had arrived to transport Webster to Mars. The reader is made to understand that Webster probably could not steel himself again for departure, and so Juwain would die.  External links  * Category:Short stories by Clifford D.

Early life Hotzeas was born in Koroni, Messenia, Peloponnese, in a poor family. In 1941, his elder brothers are already organized in EPON, the youth organization of the National Liberation Front (EAM) fighting the Nazi occupation forces. In 1943 Hotzeas becomes a devoted and extremely active member of EPON in Athens. The next year, despite his very young age, Hotzeas became a member of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), according to an exceptional decision of the Party leadership. Persecutions Since 1944, Hotzeas took part in the fights against the Nazi forces and their collaborators. The liberation in December 1944 was followed by fights against the British Army that arrived in Athens and opposed the communist-led National Liberation Front forces. During the following two years Hotzeas was arrested and tortured several times, both by the local police and by the British. In 1947, while the Greek Civil War was raging, Hotzeas was arrested again and exiled to Makronisos and then in other islands. Despite the tortures, he refused to declare any repentance for his beliefs. For this reason he was kept in exile until 1958. Disagreements Already in exile, Hotzeas becomes a leading figure in the opposition of the communist rank-and-file to the \\"new line\\" promoted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after its 20th Congress. This line was imposed on the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) after a violent intervention of the Soviet Party in the internal affairs of KKE, which resulted to the unconstitutional replacement and persecution of its legitimate leadership and to the expulsion of thousands of its members. Returning from the exile, Hotzeas becomes one of the main poles of opposition to the changing and more \\"mild\\" policies of the Greek Left's new leadership. Building the Greek M-L movement In the early 1960s Hotzeas started to translate the documents of the international debate between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which marked the Sino-Soviet split. In 1964, he led the publication of the magazine Renaissance (), and then the creation and development of the Organisation of Marxists-Leninists of Greece (OMLE). 1967‚Äì1974 military dictatorship Right after the military coup of 21 April 1967 which established a Greek military junta, Hotzeas passed in clandestinity and continued leading the OMLE. He was arrested two years later and started a new period of life in exile, interrupted briefly during the \\"liberalisation\\" of the military regime in 1973. He was arrested and exiled once more after his participation in the anti-fascist popular uprising of 17 November 1973 (Athens Polytechnic uprising), and regained his freedom only after the fall of the military dictatorship in July 1974.

History Eastbury Secondary School was founded at Dawson Ave in 1931. After the implementation of the tripartite system, it became a secondary modern. It merged with South East Essex Secondary Technical School in 1970 and moved to Rosslyn Road to become Eastbury Comprehensive School when the scheme was abolished. The school has been renamed to Eastbury Community School because a new primary school has been built inside a secondary school, which took over almost half of the Eastbury's playground. The primary school could take more than 1 or 2 years to come to fruition. In addition, the student population is expected to rise to over 2000, making it of the biggest schools in Barking and Dagenham. Campus The school once covered two locations, a \\"lower\\" site in Rosslyn Road, accommodating Years 7-8 and, an \\"upper\\" site in Dawson Avenue, for Years 9-13. Eastbury merged the two sites so that it is now solely based in Rosslyn Road, alluding to extensions of the site, modernised buildings and facilities and a general 'revamp' of the premises. Eastbury also has a Sixth Form Centre. In 2006, Eastbury became a Secondary School specialising in Mathematics and Information Communication Technology. The lower site was used to film the BBC children's TV drama M.I. High. Use of technology The school's Sixth Form is the only one in London to have a Cisco Networking Academy. In 2010 the school was the first in Barking and Dagenham to introduce a cashless payment system using a contactless smart card. The Street Base Connect Card also gives access to youth, health, leisure and library services.

The club was a founding member of the Rugby Football Union and were at that time known as the Wimbledon Hornets. The first team currently play in London & South East Premier following their relegation from National League 2 South at the end of the 2017-18 season. History Wimbledon‚Äôs first recorded match was against Richmond F.C. in November 1865, making the club one of the oldest in the country, and one of just twelve surviving clubs that founded the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The club‚Äôs captain at this time was L J Maton who drafted the first laws of the game and went on to become the third president of the RFU in 1875. In the same year, two club members, J D and H J Graham, gained one and four caps respectively for England. In 1874 the club changed its name to Wimbledon RFC. It has been suggested that the change in name was due to the club's L J Maton becoming president of the Rugby Football Union, and in order to reflect their new-found gravitas they dispensed with the Hornets for a less whimsical name.Dick Tyson, London's Oldest Rugby Clubs, p159 (JJG Publishing), 2008 The club played on Wimbledon Common until World War I, using the Rose & Crown in Wimbledon Village as changing rooms and clubhouse. The club then went into suspended animation when the First World War started, and was only re-formed in 1927. It was at this time that the club changed colours from broad blue and white hooped jerseys, to maroon and Cambridge blue hooped jerseys.Dick Tyson, London's Oldest Rugby Clubs, p158 (JJG Publishing), 2008 The club's celebration of its centenary with a dinner held in February 1966, was demonstrative that it perceived itself a continuation of the original Wimbledon Hornets. The club moved to its current clubhouse on Barham Road, Wimbledon in the 1987‚Äì88 season, coinciding with the setting up of amateur league rugby in Britain.

Teams Wimbledon has four men's teams, a ladies team and a thriving youth & mini section. The men's teams Wimbledon currently has four men's teams. The 1st team play in London & South East Premier (Nat3SE), as a result of result of relegation from National League 2S in the 2017‚Äì18 season. The 2nd team play in the Zoo Sports Shield Division 1 having won consecutive promotions from Division 3 and 2 in the 2015‚Äì16/2016-17 seasons. The 3rds or Mavericks as they are fondly known and the 4ths Strollers (the Vets team) compete in the Surrey Leagues. The ladies team The ladies team was founded in the 1990‚Äì91 season by Tina and John Ambler, club stewards from 1989 to 1993. Their team mascot is Alderney, one of The Wombles. The first ladies match was against a selection of players from the men's teams. Due to a lack of playing experience the men emerged the victors.

Originating from research published by Robert J. Glushko and Tim McGrath, document engineering attempts to unify these different analysis and modeling perspectives and helps to specify, design, and implement documents and the processes that create and consume them. In the context of document engineering, document generally refers to ordered pieces of information used by computer applications or web services rather than directly by people. It has particular relevance in the areas of XML vocabulary design. The principles of document engineering were applied to the development of the OASIS Universal Business Language. From 2003 to 2007, the University of California, Berkeley operated a research center for document engineering, which has been subsumed by its program in Information and Service Design. The conventional discipline that most resembles document engineering is probably business informatics. However, document engineering emphasizes the need for conceptual modeling of documents and processes at an implementable granularity.

He initiated structural studies across orogenic belts in Tanzania-Zambia-Malawi (in the late 1960s), major studies across the Limpopo Belt and adjacent Archaean greenstone belts of Zimbabwe-Botswana-South Africa (in the 1970s) and projects across the orogenic systems of Egypt, Sudan and Kenya (in the early 1980s). Just prior to his death he was working on a detailed compilation of the Precambrian geology of East Africa. At the age of 75 he led a Royal Society geological traverse across Tibet, in collaboration with the Academica Sinica, Beijing. Born in Purley, Surrey, he was educated at the Quakers' Sidcot School in Somerset and the University of Liverpool, graduating BSc in geology with First Class Honours in 1930. He went on to research at Liverpool under P.G.H. Boswell on the geology of the Moel Hebog area of Snowdonia in North Wales (PhD 1934), then won a Beit Fellowship at Imperial College, London, 1932‚Äì1934. The next year he was appointed chief geologist to Whitehall Exploration Ltd in Fiji but returned to Imperial College as lecturer in geology in 1936. In 1940 he was appointed a geologist in the Mining and Geological Department of Kenya, as part of the wartime strategic planning programme. He surveyed widely throughout Kenya producing reports for the Geological Survey of Kenya on the areas of Malikisi, North Kavirondo, Nyeri, the Migori Gold Belt, and Nanyuki and Maralal. His studies extended into the geometry of the orogenic belts of East Africa and the volcanism that produced the Rift System. In 1942 the archaeologist Mary Leakey discovered prehistoric human artefacts at Olorgesailie, a lower Palaeolithic site southwest of Nairobi. In the mid-1940s she and Louis Leakey excavated the site, and Shackleton collaborated with the investigations, preparing geological maps of the area around the Olorgesailie site and the area between Olorgesailie and Ngong. Shackleton returned to Imperial College in 1945 and was offered a professorship there. However, he thought the department too unmanageable and in 1948 returned to Liverpool as the Herdman Professor of Geology. In his time in the Herdman chair, he re-organised the Liverpool geology department and put it at the forefront of geological research in Britain. In 1962, to increase his opportunities for research in Africa, he took up a chair in the University of Leeds and joined the staff of the Research Institute of African Geology (serving as director from 1965 until retirement). 1970‚Äì1971 he was Royal Society Leverhulme Visiting Professor of Geology at the Haile Selassie University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He formally retired in 1975 but was research fellow at the Open University from 1977 until his death and remained active in field geology. His achievements were recognised by the award of the Silver Medal of the Liverpool Geological Society (1957) and the Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London (1970), and his election to the Fellowship of the Royal Society (1971). His Royal Society citation recorded that he was \\"well-known for his contributions to the study of crystalline rocks, more particularly of rock deformation and large scale tectonics.\\" Of particular importance have been his work on Tertiary volcanics in Kenya, his understanding of the Pre-Cambrian of eastern and central Africa and his accounts of Dalradian structures and deposits\\". Shackleton married three times and had five children, including geoscientist Professor Sir Nicholas Shackleton (1937‚Äì2006). The 'Robert Shackleton Award for Outstanding Precambrian Research in Africa' is the flagship award of the Geological Society of Africa.

The head office is in Nova South, 160 Victoria Street, London. Nord Anglia has 66 private day and boarding schools which are located in 29 countries across the Americas, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East. History Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm. In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice became CEO. By 2008, the company had sold its nursery business and mainly focused on international schools. In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, it bought World Class Learning Group, with schools in the US, Qatar and Spain. The company's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE. In 2015, the company bought six schools from Meritas: the Coll√®ge du L√©man, L√©man International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida. In April 2017, the company announced it would be taken back into private ownership after the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Baring Private Equity Asia agreed to buy it. In December 2017, the company bought seven schools from the British Schools Foundation: The British College of Brazil, The British International School of Kuala Lumpur, The British School of Nanjing, The British School of Tashkent, The British School of Yangon, The International School of Moscow, and The King's School Manila. In May 2019 the company moved their headquarters to London, and relocated operations to London. In February 2019, the company acquired five schools under the Oakridge International brand in India. The five schools are located in Hyderabad, Vishakhapatnam, Bengaluru and Mohali. The price was estimated at about ‚Çπ16 billion.  Global Campus  Nord Anglia students are connected through the Global Campus, a program which offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.  Collaborations  In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer a Master's in International Education. The courses are designed to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by the company and available only to its teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.  Schools = Asia = China  All Nord Anglia Education schools in China use English as the primary language of instruction.

He was best known for his depictions of cityscapes, including his painting \\"74th Street Rooftops From Studio.\\" Early life Herman Rappaport was born in Brooklyn, New York. in 1909. Originally trained as a draftsman and studied at the National Academy of Design from 1927 to 1929, he was later employed by the Works Progress Administration's Murals Division under Arshile Gorky from 1934 until 1939. In 1939, after experimenting with a variety of contemporary expressionistic styles, Rose decided to paint from life. Working mostly in East New York and East Canarsie in Brooklyn, and in Manhattan, Rose began to paint roof tops and street scenes. Painting Rappaport began using the name Herman Rose when he held his first solo art exhibition in 1946 at the Charles Egan Gallery in New York City. Although he initially began as an Expressionistic painter, he became known for small, light-filled Impressionist paintings of still life, cityscapes and skies by the early 1950s. His paintings and images were often composed of very small dabs of paint and tiny, blurry \\"squares,\\" which combined to create the image on canvas, his favorite medium. Often described as a \\"lyrical painter\\" Rose's work \\"interpreted traditional subjects: landscape, still life and the figure....like the Post- Impressionists from whom he developed his own style, Rose built up forms from distinct touches of color that don't entirely blend in the viewer's eye. This gives his surfaces an active quality that flattens forms, one of the great lessons of modernism.\\"Robert Bunkin, Curator Staten Island Museum Herman Rose's work received official recognition when Ms. Dorothy Miller of Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) included his work in an exhibition called, \\"15 Americans,\\" alongside work by Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock. New York Times art critic Hilton Kramer wrote of Rose's work in 1981, \\"{he} must surely be counted among the most beautiful works anyone has produced in this challenging medium for many years.\\" The Art in America art critic Lawrence Campbell wrote of his work in 1990, \\"Herman Rose, who is, in my opinion, the greatest living painter of landscape and still life in the U.S., has never for a moment abandoned the practice of painting from direct observation. ... Yet when Rose looks at anything, he seems able to participate with his entire being in the scene 'out there,' seeing beyond the relationships of space, distance and comparative size, or even of reflected light. It is this intensity of perception that becomes the true subject of his painting, rather than the subject itself as it is seen by others.\\" Over the next forty years Rose's works were featured in over 20 separate solo art exhibitions, including a group show, at the Louis Stern Gallery in Beverly Hills, CA which featured Marc Chagall, Henri Fantin-Latour, Alberto Giacometti, Robert Maplethorpe, Henri Matisse, Edwin Dickinson, Georgia O'Keefe and Pablo Picasso. His last solo exhibition took place at the Mercury Gallery in 2007. His work is in the collections of several major museums including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Academy of Design. Rose also worked as an art teacher and professor. He taught at Brooklyn College from 1949 until 1951. He held additionally posts at Hofstra University, Pratt Institute and Queens College before taking a teaching position at The New School from 1963 until his retirement in 1990. Death Herman Rose died of cancer at the age of 98 at Westbeth Artists Community, his home in New York City. He was survived by his wife, Elia Braca Rose, and his two sons from his first marriage (which ended in divorce), George Rappaport and Andrew Rose.

Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) is a public university in Morogoro, Tanzania, specializing in agriculture. The university is named after the country's second prime minister Edward Sokoine. Introduction Sokoine University of Agriculture was established on 1 July 1984 by Parliamentary Act No. 6 of the same year. It is 3.0 km from the centre of Morogoro Municipality, which is about 200 km west of Dar es Salaam. The university is made up of four campuses and one constituent college. The campuses are the * Main and Solomon Mahlangu campuses in Morogoro * Olmotonyi Campus in Arusha * Mazumbai Campus in Lushoto SUA has six mandates: selling, customs care, training, research, consultancy and outreach. SUA offers training that lead to awards of certificates, diplomas, bachelors, masters, and doctorates. Non-degree programmes include Diploma in Information and Library Science, Diploma in Records, Archives and Information Management, Diploma in Animal Health and Production, Diploma in Laboratory Technology. The Sokoine National Agricultural Library is SUA's Library and the Tanzania National Agricultural Library. The library provides services to the university community and other stakeholders in the agricultural and related sectors, it also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Information Sciences.  History  The university traces its roots back to 1965 in Morogoro, where it initially began as an agriculture college offering diploma training in agricultural practices. After the dissolution of the East African Community in 1970, the University of East Africa, which was the only university in East Africa offering agriculture degrees in the region, was also dissolved. This led the Government of Tanzania to create a domestic institution, which led to the establishment of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Dar es Salaam. Sokoine Agriculture College fell under this umbrella and under the mandate of the University of Dar es Salaam, started to offer Bachelors of Science in Agriculture. Further progress continued to develop in the Faculty of Agriculture; in 1974 the Division of Forestry was established and in 1976 the division of veterinary science was established. This led to the faculty's renaming to the \\"Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Sciences\\". With growing enrollment numbers, the parliament decided to separate the faculty and create a fully fledged university to help boost agriculture growth in the country. Through Parliamentary Act No. 6 of 1984, the faculty was then transformed into a university and today is known as Sokoine University of Agriculture.

He drowned at sea in circumstances which are unclear. Edward the Elder died in 924, leaving five sons by three marriages. Of these, Edmund and Eadred were infants and thus excluded from the succession. Edward's careful work of expansion was undone when the Mercians chose Edward's oldest son √Üthelstan‚Äîprobably raised in Mercia at the court of √Üthelfl√¶d‚Äîto be their king while the West Saxons picked √Ülfweard, elder son of Edward's second wife √Ülffl√¶d, who was perhaps Edward's own choice as successor. √Ülfweard's \\"sudden and convenient\\"Thacker, Dynastic monasteries, pp. 254‚Äì255. death followed 16 days after that of his father, but √Üthelstan appears not to have been recognised as king by the West Saxons until a year after his father's death, suggesting that there was considerable resistance to him and perhaps also support for Edwin.Hill, Age of Athelstan, pp. 101‚Äì105. The contemporary evidence for Edwin's life is very limited. At some point during the reign of his half-brother √Üthelstan, Edwin witnessed a charter, S 1417, at New Minster, Winchester, granting lands to one Alfred, a thegn (minister) of King √Üthelstan. Edwin witnesses the charter immediately after his half-brother and is described as √¶theling (clito). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that Edwin drowned at sea in 933.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 107, Ms. E, s.a. 933. The Francian Annales Bertiniani compiled by Folcuin provide more detail: Later writers such as William of Malmesbury and Simeon of Durham rewrote Edwin's death. Sir Frank Stenton saw their reports as suggesting that \\"a rebellion against Athelstan may have been organised within the royal house itself\\".Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 355‚Äì356. Simeon's version baldly states that \\"King √Üthelstan commanded that his brother Edwin be drowned at sea\\".Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 107, note 11. William's account is much longer and associates Edwin's death with an earlier plot to blind √Üthelstan and replace him with Edwin. In this version, √Üthelstan is convinced by jealous courtiers to have Edwin sent to sea in a leaky boat, without oars, without food, and without water. Despairing, Edwin throws himself into the sea and drowns.Hill, Age of Athelstan, p. 202. The Annales Bertiniani say that the monks of Saint Bertin were granted a monastery at Bath by \\"King √Üthelstan\\" in 944‚Äîin fact King Edmund, √Üthelstan having died in 939‚Äîin gratitude for their care of Edwin's remains.Whitelock, English Historical Documents, p. 346.

Goldberg began taking classes at the Art Students League of New York at age 14. In the 1950s he studied painting with Hans Hofmann, and he discussed painting with Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko and several others of the New York School sometimes at The Eighth Street Club,Marika Herskovic, New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists, (New York School Press, 2000.) p.11 a regular meeting place of modern artists working in and around Tenth Street in New YorkUniversity of Kentucky Art Museum, retrieved January 4, 2008 and sometimes at the Cedar Bar.Sandler, Irving H. The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties, New York: Harper & Row, 1978. pp.2-29 He began to exhibit his paintings in New York City during the early 1950s, and some of his abstract expressionist peers included artists like Joan Mitchell, Alfred Leslie, Grace Hartigan, Helen Frankenthaler, Knox Martin, Friedel Dzubas, Norman Bluhm and Sam Francis among others. Michael Goldberg came into prominence in the late 1950s, early 1960s just as Color field painting, Hard-edge painting and Pop Art emerged onto centerstage. With the changing of fashions in the art world; his greatest accomplishments as a painter weren't sufficiently recognized; and as many of his generation his work was overlooked for many years. Although by the 1970s and 1980s his work began to achieve recognition and appreciation and he enjoyed a long, successful and a celebrated career as an abstract painter. His work like others of the abstract expressionist generation expressed a painterly integration of Western metaphysics and Eastern philosophy. Throughout his long career and into his mature years, he continued to teach, paint, and exhibit his work. His classes at the School of Visual Arts were well attended by devoted students, and admirers. He lived with his wife and longtime companion, the painter Lynn Umlauf, who also teaches at the School of Visual Arts. He died in Manhattan of a heart attack. He is also survived by his brother, the writer Gerald Jay Goldberg.  Collections  Goldberg's work is in the collections of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Chrysler Museum of Art, the Walker Art Center, the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R.

The organization was renamed as the Integration Consortium in 2005 and subsequently moved its operations to the U.S. and incorporated as a non-profit in Delaware in 2006. Beginning in 2004, the IC has held an annual call for papers (CFP) in order to uncover emerging integration practices and to identify integration thought leaders and practice leaders. Submitted papers that pass a peer review process are published in an annual Integration Journal. The 2004 through 2007 publications include over 100 white-papers and case studies. Papers may be submitted by members or non-members. The Integration Journal is the first open peer reviewed publication on the topic of integration outside of strictly academic institutions. The concept of integration as a competency in the IT domain began in the mid-1990s with advent of middleware technology. It has now matured for over 10 years and appears to be picking up momentum and broad- based acceptance as evidenced by the programs of educational institutions. Universities are beginning to include integration topics in their MBA programs and Computer Science curricula. For example, The College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University has established a Enterprise Informatics and Integration Center with the following mission: The Enterprise Informatics and Integration Center (EI¬≤) will actively engage industry, non- profit, and government agency leaders to address critical issues in enterprise processes, knowledge management, and decision making.

They are a part of the West Bengal Police, as opposed to the Kolkata jurisdiction. The Border Guards Bangladesh are descended from the portion of the Eastern Frontier Rifles given to Pakistan during the partitioning of 1947. The Eastern Frontier Rifles were founded as the \\"Frontier Protection Force\\" by the East India Company in the second half of the eighteenth century, and have held their current title since 1920. The Eastern Frontier Rifles fought in the First World War (as the Bengal Military Police) and also in the Second World War. When India and Pakistan became independent in 1947, the force was split between West Bengal and Pakistan and the Pakistani part became the East Pakistan Rifles. When in turn East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) became independent, it was called Bangladesh Rifles, and recently in 2010, it was renamed Border Guards Bangladesh. The West Bengal (i.e. Indian) part of the force, however, retained the original name of Eastern Frontier Rifles. History *18th century: Founded as Frontier Protection Force. *1795: Renamed Ramgarh Local Battalion. *1861: Renamed Frontier Guards. *1891: Renamed Bengal Military Police, modernised, and given up-to-date weaponry.

The former retained the unit's original title. =Past and present= On 1 February 1910, the Silchar and Garo Hills Battalions were amalgamated with Dacca Battalion. Subsequently, in the same year, a detachment of 100 men was raised at Barisal and a full-fledged battalion with the strength of one Commandant, 4 Assistant Commandants, 8 Subedars, 8 Jamadars, 66 Havildars, and 664 Sepoys and Buglers was created at Dacca Headquarters, with detachments at Tura, Silchar and Barisal. In 1911, the battalion participated for the first time in military operations in the Mishmi Mission. In November 1911, a battalion school headquarters with a staff of a single full-time teacher was sanctioned and started functioning. Owing to the repartition of Eastern Bengal and Assam, consequent upon the Delhi Darbar announcement in 1912, many changes took place in the battalion. The Silchar and Garo Hills detachment were transferred to the Assam Government with effect from 1 November of the same year. As a result, the battalion was decreased and it became First Bengal Military Police Battalion. The composition of the force then consisted of 1 Commandant, 2 Assistant Commandants, 1 Subedar Major, 3 Subedars, 4 Jamadars, 39 Havildars and 664 Sepoys and Buglers. In early 1912, this battalion received the commendation of the local government for the excellent and arduous duties performed in guarding extremist prisoners. The Mishmi mission detachment returned at the end of February 1912, again with a commendation from His Majesty's Imperial Government for their excellent work. In January of the same year, the Viceroy Lord Hardinge complimented the battalion and mounted escort for their smartness and remarked on the quality of the playing band. Mr. Hughes Buller, Inspector-General of Police, also put a complimentary notice in the \\"Police Gazette\\". Later that year, Guards of Honour were presented by the Battalion to the Governor of Bengal, Lord Carmichael. The battalion was also inspected by him on 16 July, who made the following remark: \\"I was much struck by their smart and soldiery appearance. They were physically cleaned and well turned out and looked a well drilled lot of men.\\" In January 1913, on the orders of the Bengal Inspector-General of Police, a detachment of the battalion was sent to Naga Hills on an expedition. In the advance on Chenglong on 5 February the baggage guard was attacked. As a result, three sepoys of the Battalion were killed and three others seriously injured. Congratulatory messages were received from Lord Carmichael and Mr. Hughes Buller regarding the part the battalion had played in the fighting during the capture of Chenglong. Major-General E.S. May wrote to the Inspector-General of Police with regard to the work of the battalion during the Dacca concentration: :\\"The Battalion took part with the regular troops on all the combined field days. They marched well and were active and keen and their energy did not flag at the end of any of our long days in the field. Their training seemed to me to be good and efficient and carried out on the right lines. Under all circumstances the conduct of the men was excellent and they acquitted themselves in a disciplined soldier like manner.

The title of Sardar Bahadur has conferred on you and now, as I have said, it gives me great pleasure to.\\" Two detachment camps were set up at Buxadar and Hoogly in 1914 with two new companies commissioned by the Secretary of the State for India. The Battalion force was detailed for Law and Order duty in connection with the Komaghata Maru Sikhs Riots at Howrah and did excellent work in rounding up the rioters, and earning the thanks of the Governments of Punjab and Bengal. At the Police parade held at Dacca on 8 August, Subedar Major Gopal Chandra, Sardar Bahadur, was decorated with the insignia of the Order of the British India, 1st class, by Lord Ronald Shay, Governor of Bengal, who in decorating him made the following remarks: :\\"It gives me great pleasure to decorate you with the Insignia of the Order of British India. 1st Class. In your case the service has extended over a period of nearly 40 years and for over 30 years out of the long term you have held the King's Commission, you have seen active decorate you with the Insignia of the Order of British India.\\" A report of the Police Administration in the Bengal Presidency stated: :\\"Good accounts have been received of the contingent serving with the Mesopotamia Expedition force where a Lance Naik Poli Ram has recently had been awarded the I.O.M. The Bengal Military Police furnished reinforcements for the regular Army at that time of National emergency. The officer and men so lent to the Army have been conspicuous for their soldierly gallant conduct in the field and their behaviour while serving in the regular army troops in the field has left nothing to be desired.\\" The Bengal Military Police won its present name \\"Eastern Frontier Rifles\\" from the Government of India in 1920, in appreciation for war services rendered. The Eastern Frontier Rifles (Bengal Battalion) Act was passed the same year and the Eastern Frontier Rifles (Bengal Battalion) Regulations issued in 1922. In 1921 the Battalion was recognized on the Platoon System, while in 1923 it was given web equipment. Notably, some detachments proceeded to Chittagaon in 1930 as a result of the Armory Raid. On 22 April they engaged the Raiders;12 persons were killed and 29 police muskets and 2000 rounds of ammunition and many empty cases were recovered. Four of them were killed and two captured while six revolvers were recovered. The District Magistrate, Mymensingh, wrote to the Government of Bengal, saying that: \\"Eastern Frontier Rifles have been invaluable as usual. The mere fact of their presence is a valuable asset to District Authorities.\\" In 1937, the approved strength of the battalion was 1 Commandant, 3 Assistant Commandants, 8 Subedars, 8 Jamadars, 70 Havildars, and 753 other ranks. In 1938, a detachment of one platoon proceeded to Rampore state in Orissa on special duty. The battalion continued to impress the authorities with their services in controlling communal riots, suppressing violent hostiles and extremists, guarding dangerous prisoners in peacetime, and fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Indian Army during the wars. The battalion also became renowned for its impressive ceremonial parades and was given the privilege of furnishing guards of honour, house guards and escorts to Viceroys and other dignitaries. In December 1941, a St. Johns Ambulance Division was formed in the battalion for the first time. This battalion was shifted from Dacca to Hijli on 1 September 1947. On 14 July 1951 it was relocated from Hijli to Salua in the district of Midnapur where the Eastern Frontier Rifles are stationed to date. Post-independence, the Eastern Frontier Rifles continued with their tradition of loyalty, sincerity and gallantry, effectively participating in various operations. They were deployed whenever serious communal riots broke out and when the Civil Police found itself unable to suppress violent elements defying the authority of the state and endangering lives and property. Before 1956 the duties performed by the Eastern Frontier Rifles Battalion were in connection with the communal troubles and border skirmishes within the state of West Bengal. In 1956 the Battalion was deputed to Manipur and the Naga Hills for suppression of the Naga insurgency. The government was reluctant to deploy the Army for various reason at the initial stages; on the other hand, they wanted a strong police action in the area. Eventually the Eastern Frontier Rifles was attached to the 11th Indian Army, when the Army moved in. The force performed their duties with commendable courage, devotion and fortitude under very difficult circumstances. The EFR suffered 4 casualties, and when in 1961 the Indian Army moved in, they were withdrawn. Beside their deployment to the Naga Hills, the Eastern Frontier Rifles had performed as border security duties as well. Most of the border with East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was unmanned and therefore porous. Border rules and regulations were also constantly under review and thus there were occasional boundary skirmishes. In 1950, in Dhatupara in Nadia District, there was encounter with the Pakistan Force. The exchange of fire continued for about a week, with casualties on both sides. EFR lost 1 Naik and 1 rifleman. With the taking over of the border by the Border Security Force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles was withdrawn from the Indo-Pak Border. In 1962, when India's border skirmishes with China developed into a war, the question of internal security came to the fore and once again attention went towards the Eastern Frontier Rifles and the 2nd Battalion, which is also stationed in Salua, was deployed to keep the peace in the state. In June 1982, the services of four companies of EFR battalions were placed at the disposal of the Bihar Government to remain as a Reserve Force during the General Assembly Election of Bihar. Awards and honours On 15 October 1911 Subedar Major Gopal Chandra with two havildars and ten sepoys attended the Delhi Darbar to receive medals. 20 Abor Medals were given to the men who had been engaged in operations under the command of Major General Bower. Subedar Major Gopal Chandra Kharag Singh received the Order of the British India conferred on him in December 1912 and in the same year Subedar Kharag Singh received the King's Police Medal for long and meritorious service. In 1914, in recognition of good work done in the Naga Hills expeditions, the King's Police Medal was awarded to Captain E.D. Dallas Smith, Lance Naik Mohan Chandra, Sepoy Dhanjoi Ram and Havildar Dhaga Ram. In 1917, Lance Naik Pholi Ram was awarded I.O.M. Second Class while serving in the Indian Army at Mesopotamia. Owing to the excellent work done by Shri P.C. Dutta, Head Clerk, EFR Battalion, in the interest of the battalion since it was formed and on the recommendation of the Commandant, the title of \\"Raisaheb\\" was conferred on him in the Birthday Honours List 1922. Subedar Major Daga Ram Kachari was made a \\"Sardar Bahadur\\" in January 1925, for his good services. Sardar Bahadur Subedar Major Ganesh Bahadur Chhetri was made a member of the Order of the British Empire in the Birthday Honours List 1931. In 1939, the title of \\"Sardar Bahadur\\" was conferred on Subedar Major Bistu Ram in the New Years Honours List. Major Weleb, Assistant Commandant, and Subedar Harka Bahadur Lama received the Indian Police Medal in 1939. The Indian Police Medal was also awarded to the following personnel after independence: * Subedar Major Ran. Bah. Subba for Meritorious Service in 1959. * Subedar Major Dwip Bahadur Chhetri for Meritorious Service. * Subedar Rama Kanta Kachari ‚Äî Gallantry Medal in 1950. * Subedar Ashutosh Kachari for Meritorious Service in 1965. * Subedar Sukman Thapa for Meritorious Service in 1969. * Late Rifleman Til Bahadur Tamang ‚Äî Gallantry Medal in 1976. * Late Lance Naik Bhaktah Bahadur Rai ‚Äî Gallantry Medal in 1976. * Subedar Major Tikendra Ch. Kachari ‚Äî Meritorious Services in 1981. The Eastern Frontier Rifles Band Although buglers were appointed in 1907 in the Dacca Battalion of the Eastern Bengal and Assam Military Police, which was later renamed EFR Battalion, they did form a part of the Band Party. In 1920, 20 gorkhas were discharged sepoys of Gurkha Regiments were recruited for the band and one as bugler. In 1909, 6 gorkhas were enlisted for the band and one as a bugler. In 1912, this battalion received a set of six bagpipes from Charles Bayley, Lieutenant-Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam in recognition of their excellent services. The band of the EFR 1st Battalion is known as the State band of the West Bengal Government. Its splendid performances during combined Police parades, Republic Day parades, state functions at Raj Bhavan and visits of foreign dignitaries like the Emperor of Ethiopia, Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China, Poland, Romanian People's Republic, Argentina, Queen Elizabeth II, King of Nepal, President of Indonesia and others were appreciated by all who were present at those occasions. Whenever any state function is held in West Bengal, the services of this band party are requested to add colour to the occasion. Ex. Sub. Surbir Gurung of this battalion represented West Bengal in the All India Championship Shooting Competition in 1958 and National Championship Shooting Competition in 1959 held at Calcutta, New Delhi and Bangalore, respectively and won 1st and 2nd prizes. In sports, EFR personnel are always to be reckoned with: Sub. Major Tiken Ram Kachari and Naik/Sub. Saban Ram Kachari of this battalion are well known figures in hockey who attained national prominence. Naik Bachpan Lohar and Rifleman Anil Rava of the 1st Battalion represented West Bengal for the Agha Khan Gold Cup in 1977. Shri Bir Bahadur Chhetri who represented India in the Olympic hockey tournament in 1976 and 1980 at Montreal and Moscow, respectively, was Lance Naik of this battalion. Occasional cultural functions with traditional dances and music are organised in the battalion for the recreation of the Eastern Frontier Rifles personnel and their family members. Extra-curricular activities Important tactical training courses are being organised in the battalion. Recently tactical cum security training courses were conducted at the battalion for about 100 officers and men from the Rank of Dy.S.Ps to Havildars. The Eastern Frontier Rifles battalions have a number of crack shots. As a result, almost every year the battalions become champions in shooting competitions, whether in the Brigade or in the State. In 1981 and 1982 this battalion also won the H.N. Gupta Memorial Challenge Cup as the best team in inter-district and inter-unit revolver shooting competitions among police teams in West Bengal. At present still in Salua unlike armed police forces of most states, the EFR is currently challenged with the Naxalite insurgency. In February 2010 an EFR camp called Silda was attacked and burnt down by Maoist rebels, resulting in the loss of 24 riflemen out of a detachment of about fifty. This resulted in condemnation of the state government by the EFR Special Inspector General, Benoy Chakraborty, who claimed his force was \\"miss-used\\" and \\"ill-treated\\". Morale in the force is believed to be low. The Eastern Frontier Rifles continues to be prized possession. In 1984, a new battalion was inaugurated to boost the strength and pride of the EFR. It is now located in Salua with the mother battalion.

He was inspired by the simple and colourful lifestyle of native tribes from the south of the country such as the Yakans, the Bogobos and the Tausugs. He joined a local group of artists in Ermita, Manila, and sold his paintings locally, gradually gaining recognition. Paco started with crayons, later using water colours but finally shifted to oil paintings. His paintings caught the eye of Lydia Arguilla, founder of the Philippine Art Gallery (PAG), who displayed his work at PAG and included over 40 of his paintings in her personal collection. Gorospe's first major exhibition, due largely to Lydia Arguilla's patronage, took place in 1962 at the World's Fair in Seattle, Washington.https://www.galeriehartung.de/gorospe-paco Following his stint at the \\"Century 21\\" World's Fair in Seattle, US sales increased, and in 1964 his works were chosen to represent the Philippines at the World's Fair in New York.

RRS Discovery (III) was built in Aberdeen in 1962 and named after Robert Falcon Scott's 1901 ship, RRS Discovery. Until 2006, she was the largest general purpose oceanographic research vessel in use in the United Kingdom. Measuring 90 metres in length, and fitted with a broad range of oceanographic equipment, Discovery could also accommodate containerized laboratories. She had berths for 28 scientific staff, and the ability to spend up to 45 days at sea. Her last major overhaul was in 1991, when a new superstructure and power plant were installed and her hull lengthened by 10 metres. Discovery carried out oceanographic and marine biology research from the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. She operated as part of a fleet maintained by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) National Marine Facilities Division (NMFD), along with the larger RRS James Cook. In February 2000, Discovery observed some of the largest waves, called rogue waves, up to 29.1 metres (95.5 feet), recorded by scientific instruments up to that time.Holliday, NP, MJ Yelland, RW Pascal, VR Swail, PK Taylor, CR Griffiths, and EC Kent (2006).

During World War II, he served as the Minister for the Economy in Milan Nediƒá's German-installed Government of National Salvation which operated in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia between 1941 and 1944. He fled Yugoslavia towards the end of the war and emigrated to Australia, where he died in 1961. Early life Mihailo Olƒáan was born on 18 September 1894 in Crepaja, Austria-Hungary. He was a nephew of Serbian inventor Mihailo Pupin and finished gymnasium in Novi Sad, where he joined a number of nationalist student movements. Olƒáan enrolled to study medicine at the university in Pest. He joined the Austro-Hungarian Army with the outbreak of World War I and was sent to fight on the Eastern Front, where he defected to the Russians and joined a Serbian volunteer detachment. He distinguished himself while fighting for the Serbs and was awarded the Cross of St. George and the Order of the White Eagle with swords. He later fought on the Salonika Front. In the post-war years, he led several volunteer organizations in Vojvodina and lived in Petrovgrad (modern Zrenjanin). He joined the Yugoslav National Movement (, Zbor) upon its creation in 1935. The movement's leader, Dimitrije Ljotiƒá, came to see Olƒáan as one of his most trusted lieutenants. World War II Following the Axis invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, Olƒáan became a member of puppet administration known as the Government of National Salvation. On 29 August 1941, he was named to a ministerial position with the government of Prime Minister Milan Nediƒá. Nediƒá appointed him Minister of Economy. At a government meeting on 14 September 1941, Olƒáan suggested that Ljotiƒá's volunteers be armed to suppress an uprising by the Yugoslav Partisans. The puppet government conceded and Olƒáan later established a recruitment office for the Serbian Volunteer Command (, SDK). More than 600 volunteers enlisted within the next several days. The following month, Olƒáan boasted that Serbia \\"has been allowed what no other occupied country has been allowed [and that is] to establish law and order [...] by means of [its] own armed forces.\\" In the spring of 1942, he commented on The Holocaust and stated that the Jews had \\"met the fate they deserved\\" after being blessed by Serbian Orthodox Bishop Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá. He explained that Serbs should be grateful that \\"the powerful sledgehammer of Germany had come down not on the heads of the Serbian people but on the heads of Serbia's Jews instead\\". Olƒáan was dismissed from Nediƒá's cabinet in October 1942 and became, on German insistence, a de facto political commissar of the Serbian Volunteer Corps (, SDK) in October 1943. He worked as a direct representative of Dimitrije Ljotiƒá and enjoyed the full confidence of the Germans. In early 1944, Olƒáan was sent to Montenegro, along with a detachment of the SDK, in order to help establishment of the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps. In December, he and other members of the now-exiled Serbian puppet administration met with Velimiroviƒá and Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V in Vienna. Exile and death Olƒáan fled Yugoslavia at the end of the war and moved to Australia, where he lived until his death in late 1961.

Yates' specialty as a biologist was the study of rodents and other small mammals. Early life Terry Yates was born in Mayfield, Kentucky. He earned his bachelor's degree from Murray State University before completing his master's degree in biology from Texas A&M; in 1975. He later received his doctorate in biology from Texas Tech University in 1978. Hantavirus Residents living in the Four Corners region, which encompasses parts of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, began to experience a mysterious illness in the spring of 1993. The then unknown virus killed 32 people in just a few weeks, and sickened many others. The illness was originally nicknamed \\"Sin Nombre,\\" after a New Mexican canyon where Spanish settlers massacred Native Americans during the colonial era. Terry Yates, a professor at the University of New Mexico, joined an interdisciplinary research team charged with finding the source of the mysterious illness by the National Science Foundation. Yates, along with his research assistant, Robert Parmenter, isolated the source of the illness, which became known as the hantavirus, by using animal specimens which he had collected throughout the American Southwest. Yates found that the hantavirus was carried by the deer mouse, a species which had a higher than usual population in early 1993 due to unusually wet weather in the region. The discovery of the hantavirus' origin by Yates has helped to save lives and warn residents about the risks of the disease. The virus has killed more than 125 people between 1993 and 2007. Yates spent the later years of his life studying the connection between wet weather patterns and deer mice populations. The National Science Foundation named Yates' discovery of the cause of the hantavirus as one of the top fifty projected funded by the NSF which had the greatest impact on peoples' lives. University of New Mexico Yates was affiliated with the University of New Mexico for 29 years before his death in 2007. He served as a professor of biology and pathology, before becoming the UNM's vice president for research and economic development, a position he held until his death. Additionally, Yates directed the National Science Foundation's Division of Environmental Biology from 1990 to 1992 and again from 2000 to 2001. In 2006, he was appointed to the board of directors on life sciences of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. Death Yates lived in Placitas, New Mexico. He died of cancer on December 11, 2007, at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the age of 57. In 2017, a recently discovered species of the Oligoryzomys genus (O. yatesi) was named after him as an homage for his \\"important contribution to the Chilean mammalogy research\\".

It was created in 1996.State National Natural Park \\"Altyn-Emel\\" UNESCO The park covers about between the Ili River and the Ak-Tau mountain range, near Lake Kapchagai, and consists mostly of desert and rocky terrain.Altyn-Emel National Park Bird Life International Features Altyn Emel - Aktau Steppe in Altyn-Emel National Park Altyn-Emel National Park is located in the Ili River Valley, Kazakhstan. It comprises various landscapes, including sand desert, mountains, and flora. The park was founded on April 10, 1996, with the objective to preserve a natural park complex, as well as archaeological and historical monuments. It is the largest reserve in Kazakhstan and part of UNESCO's world heritage. It consists of two main parts ‚Äì the plain that adjoins the right Bank of the Ili river and the mountain ‚Äì the spurs of the Dzungarian Alatau and the macro-slope of the Altyn Emel range. Small island mountain ranges are located on the plains. On the territory of the Park, Carboniferous deposits (300 million years old) have been identified, which are mainly represented by volcanites, Permian and Carboniferous deposits, and the most ancient deposits are Silurian. The Park's mountains are mostly composed of Paleozoic rocks that are 200 to 400 million years old. Located within the park, the Besshatyr Burial Ground is a historical monument of Saka mounds. The burial mounds date back to the Iron Age (the VII-VI centuries BC), and were built by the nomads of Central Asian steppes. Objects found within the burial mounds include gold-plated trappings, gold adornments and utensils, weapons and armor. Another prominent feature of the area are the Aktay mountains. The Aktay mountains are also referred to as the \\"lunar mountains\\" on account of their particular colors. Aktau, which means \\"White mountains\\"in Kazakh. In translation from the Turkic-Mongolian Altyn-Emel means: \\"Altyn\\" - gold and \\"Emel\\" - saddle, which means\\"mountain pass\\". The Singing Dunes The \\"Singing Dunes\\" are located from Almaty national park. The area is referred to as the Singing Dunes on account of the rumbling sound emitted from the sand. The Singing Barchan dune is long and high. The barchan is a crescent in form. When the wind is blowing from the west dispersing the sands, it can sound as if a pipe organ is playing. The cause of this phenomenon is still a mystery, but scientists theorize that in hot dry weather the sand gets electrified due to friction and creates a certain sonic vibration.Singing Dune STeK.kz Climate and ecoregion The climate of Altyn-Emel is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over . The park is in the Tian Shan foothill arid steppe ecoregion. Flora and fauna The park serves to preserve rare and endangered plant and animal species. The flora of the Park includes 1,800 plant species, including 69 rare species. Also, 56 animal species within the park are considered rare, including argali, dziggetai, and Persian gazelle. Not counting insects and fish, at least 260 different animals live in Altyn Emel. There are endangered amphibians including the Siberian toad and rare and endangered birds including black stork and imperial eagle. Of 78 species of mammals, 11 are recorded in the Red Book of Kazakhstan, including stone marten, polecat, otter, manul (wild cat), wild ass, gazelle, argali, Asian barbastelle bat, Bukhara deer, lynx and Tien Shan brown bear. Kulan and Przewalski horses also live in the park. Among the flora, it is worth noting the ancient white and black saxaul, small groves of iron wood (Caucasian frame), and Sievers apple trees.  Kosbastau oasis The Kosbastau oasis, consisting of a grove of trees with a warm radon spring, is located in the plain between the Ulken-Kalkan Mountains in the west and the Katytau Mountains in the east. A natural monument - a 700-year-old willow - grows near the huntsman cordon. The exact age of the tree was revealed during the examination of the tree trunk, thick branches and roots. The willow was discovered during geological work in 1960.

Crawford, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. (or Whyte) was an Irish lawyer, judge, privy councillor and government official during the reign of Elizabeth I. Background and early career White was descended from a noted family of The Pale. His father, James White of Waterford, who was the steward of the earl of Ormond, had been poisoned while in London, as was the earl, in 1546. Ball, F. Elrington \\"The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921\\" London John Murray 1926 p.213Nicholas owed his early advancement to Ormond's influence: in recognition of James's loyalty, the earl left ¬£10 for the boy's education at the Inns of Court. White entered Lincoln's Inn in 1552, and he was called to the Bar in 1558;Ball p.214 during the course of his studies he was a tutor to the children of Sir William Cecil, later Lord Burghley. He then returned to Ireland and was elected a member of the Irish Parliament for Kilkenny County in 1559. Ball p.214 He was justice of the peace for County Kilkenny in 1563 and in the following year was named Recorder of Waterford. In 1567 he bought Leixlip Castle as his base near Dublin. He had stayed in correspondence with Cecil, and became an important confidant of his and thus an influential commentator on Irish affairs. In 1568 he was given the right to travel to England and had a notable interview with Mary, Queen of Scots, at Tutbury in February 1569. White may have published an English translation of the Argonautica in the 1560s, but no copy has survived. On 4 November 1568 Elizabeth, who in the early stages of his career thought well of him, appointed him seneschal of Wexford and constable of Leighlin and Ferns, replacing the disgraced adventurer Thomas Stukley. Ball p.214 He retained the office until 1572, concluding his tenure with the pursuit of the rebels, led by Fiach McHugh O'Byrne, who had murdered his son-in-law Robert Browne. White established his estate at White's Hall, near Knocktopher, County Kilkenny, and also acquired Dunbrody Abbey, County Wexford, and the Castle and St Catherine's Priory at Leixlip, County Kildare.Ball p.214 Master of the Rolls in Ireland On the recommendation of the Lord Deputy, William Fitzwilliam, White was appointed Master of the Rolls in Ireland on 14 July 1572. Despite these marks of royal favour, White was viewed by fellow privy councillors in Ireland as suspiciously partisan and often took independent positions in opposition to the dominant English-born faction on the council. Sir Henry Sidney distrusted him as a client of the Earl of Ormonde, and he was suspended from office for alleged misfeasance from August to September 1578: these charges arose from his opposition to the cess, the bitterly unpopular tax for the upkeep of military garrisons which Sidney imposed on the gentlemen of the Pale.Ball p.214 Opposition to Sidney's taxation policies became widespread and White was soon restored to favour. He also quarreled bitterly with the Attorney General for Ireland, Thomas Snagge, who accuse him of gross inefficiency. Snagge went so far as to lay information against him with the Council, though little seems to have come of this.Casey, James The Irish Law Officers Round Hall Sweet and Maxwell Dublin 1996 Desmond rebellion During the Second Desmond Rebellion White worked closely with the English political leadership as a veteran official with long experience in Munster. Nonetheless, he was now under suspicion as one who consistently favoured the interests of the Old English, and was blamed for failing to apprehend the rebels in Wicklow during the rebellion. Ball p.214However, he continued to demonstrate his valuable insights to Burghley in regular correspondence throughout the period, including letters sent in December 1581 on the miseries of war, the need for temperate government, and his fear that the wild Irish were glad to see the weakness of English blood in Ireland. His usefulness as an Irish speaker and a nominal Protestant made him an essential privy councillor for two decades.Ball p.214 Later career On the arrival in 1584 of the ambitious new Lord Deputy, Sir John Perrot, White was knightedBall p.214. He worked with Perrot to establish an effective administration of the common law.Ball p.214 Later that year 48 of the 181 prisoners in the Leinster circuit were put to death. In 1585 White was involved in arranging the Composition of Connacht. On 29 November 1586 White wrote to Burghley describing the continual bickering in council between the chief governor and the Lord Chancellor, Loftus. By the end of Perrot's regime White was viewed as a minion of the Lord Deputy who was primarily responsible for a policy of favouritism toward Irish-born servitors. On the return in 1588 of the former Lord Deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam, White became a focus of resentment from the English at the council board.Ball p.152 Arrest and death White was implicated in the allegations of treason made against Perrot by a former priest, Dennis O'Roghan, in 1589; despite his ill health, he was arrested in June 1590, and sent to England two months later. He was also dismissed from the Irish Council. Placed in the Tower of London in March 1591, White appealed to the Privy Council for a servant to attend him, owing to his age and infirmity. He died there at some time in 1592: it is unclear whether or not he was still in confinement at his death. On 12 February 1593 the Privy Council authorised White's son to bring his body back to Ireland for burial.Ball p, 214 Family White's first wife, of whom little is known, belonged to the Sherlock family of Waterford. He and his second wife, a niece of Arthur Brereton of Killyon, County Meath had two sons. Thomas, the elder, was educated at Cambridge University and died by his own hand in November 1586 after taking a strong purgative.White wrote to Burghley: \\"Now my dear good lord, I am to signify to your honour god's good pleasure in visiting me with the loss of my son, Thomas White, who ended this life the 26th of this month by taking of a strong purgative unknown to me.\\" Ref: State Papers Ireland 63/126/90, dated 29 November 1586. The younger son, Andrew, succeeded to White's estates after completing his education at Cambridge. A second Sir Nicholas White of Leixlip Castle, whose daughter Anne married Christopher Fagan, axe was probably Andrew's son. White also had two daughters, one of whom married Robert Browne of Mulcranan, County Wexford, who was murdered by Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne in 1572: the other, Mary, was the second wife of Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth, by whom she had six children. Sir Nicholas Walsh, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, is said to have grown up in White's household.

He was born in London. He studied at the Ludlow Grammar School which had instruction in Hebrew and Sanscrit as well as in Greek and Latin. He proceeded to University College, London where Olaus Henrici made him \\"realise that mathematics is an inductive science, not a set of rules and formulae.\\"G. B. Mathews (1914) Preface to Projective Geometry, page vii, Longmans, Green & Co. He then took up preparation for Cambridge Mathematical Tripos under the guidance of William Henry Besant. He came out Senior Wrangler for 1883. He was elected a Fellow of St John's College. In 1884 University College of North Wales was established under Principal Harry Reichel and Mathews as professor of mathematics. He taught alongside Andrew Gray, James Johnston Dobbie and Henry Stuart Jones. There he produced his first textbook Theory of Numbers. Part I (1892), an introduction to number theory. (It is likely that the book was studied by Ramanujan before he left for England in 1914.) In 1896, discouraged at the preparation and dedication of students, Mathews resigned and moved to Cambridge. Mathews was elected to the Royal Society in 1897. He worked as University Lecturer at Cambridge University. In 1906 he resigned from Cambridge. Returning to Bangor, Wales, he again took up teaching at University College of North Wales. He produced his book Algebraic Equations in 1907. His book on projective geometry (1914) is noted for its attention to foundations and its exposition of Karl von Staudt‚Äôs approach to imaginary units. In 1915 Glasgow University bestowed an honorary L.L.D. upon him. In 1922 he and Andrew Gray published a book on Bessel's functions. Mathews was weakened by poor nutrition under the rationing due to World War I. He had surgery in 1919, a seizure in 1921, and never recovered. Describing his friend, Andrew Gray wrote that Mathews was \\"a classical scholar and deeply interested in philosophical questions of all kinds...His mind was keen and tongue sharp.\\" Gray also noted that Mathews was \\"exceedingly sensitive, and almost morbidly afraid of appearing to put himself forward in any way, so that he hardly received the recognition that was due him.\\" Mathews authored a large number of book reviews for the scientific journal Nature. These short essays gave him ample opportunity for expression. For example, under the title \\"Mathematics and Civilisation\\", reviewing three German monographs, he wrote, \\"history of culture...change of habits of thought...nothing whatever has contributed so much as the study of pure mathematics.\\" He cites author A. Voss asserting that \\"mathematics is pre-eminently a creation of the spirit of man; it is his least restricted field of activity, and we are under a moral obligation to cultivate it.\\" In a review in 1916 he predicted World War II: :England's contempt for science, which all who know have been protesting for a generation, will, if not amended, bring her down in sorrow to the ground, whatever the issue of the present war, which will be followed by one of much greater intensity, for which the weapons will be forged, not by hands, or machines, but by brains.

Not only was Bourne a towering figure in the documentary film world but also an activist, teacher, and organizer. Biography Born in Harlem, New York, he moved to Brooklyn when he was two years old. He completed two years at the Georgetown School of Foreign Service before joining the Peace Corps. In 1965, the Peace Corps sent Bourne to Peru where he helped publish a Spanish newspaper, El Comeno, in Comas, a settlement adjacent to Lima. The November 1965 issue of Ebony magazine featured an article about Bourne's efforts in Comas. Bourne graduated from Syracuse University in 1967 with a dual degree in Journalism and Political Science. In 1988, a retrospective of his films was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In a 36-year career in which he made more than 40 films, either producing or directing or doing both, Bourne's works were seen on public television, commercial networks and at film festivals around the country.

The show draws an international attendance of exhibitors and visitors in the lighting, audio and related technologies sector of the entertainments industry.  History  The show originally started in 1977 at the Bloomsbury Crest, London, launching under the name of Discotek 77. In 1982, whilst still at the Bloomsbury Crest, it was renamed the BADEM Light & Sound Show to mirror the name of the fledgling trade association that had been set up for the sector - the British Association of Discotheque Equipment Manufacturers. BADEM was subsequently renamed the Professional Lighting and Sound Association (PLASA) and thus in 1984, the show became the PLASA Light and Sound Show. In 1985, it relocated to the Novotel in Hammersmith, then to Olympia 2 in 1988, where it stayed until 1992 before transferring to the larger Earls Court 2. It made the move from Earls Court 2 to Earls Court 1 in 1996 and in 2007 opened the doors back to Earls Court 2 and occupied both halls. In 2013 the show moved to the ExCeL exhibition centre. It stayed here for 3 years, announcing that the 2016 show would move back to West London and be hosted at Olympia. During its time at ExCeL PLASA had been hosted during the month of October - prior to this the show was typically held during September. Upon its move to Olympia, the show moved back to September.

According to Block's argument forcing a slave to perform pleasant tasks would be no less monstrous because it equally violates the libertarian non- aggression principle. An Inside Higher Education piece noted that, in response to the story, seventeen faculty members at Block's university publicly called for him to be censured for his \\"recurring public attacks ... on the civil rights of all.\\" The piece also reported that Reverend Kevin Wildes, the President of Block's university, took the \\"unusual step\\" of publicly critiquing his arguments as fallacious.Jaschik, Scott (February 24, 2014). \\"Professor Who Defends Segregation.\\" Inside Higher Education =Productivity of blacks and women= In a lecture Block called \\"Injustices in the Politics and Economics of Social Justice\\" presented at the invitation of the Adam Smith Society of the Economics Department of Loyola College, Baltimore in November 2008, Block asserted that blacks and women were paid less than whites because they are \\"less productive\\".Guess, Andy (November 19, 2008). \\"When Austrian Economics and Jesuit Theology Don't Mix.\\" Inside Higher Education In the lecture, Block defended his views on women by alleging that, among younger and unmarried women, there is virtually no income disparity.

Block did offer two thoughts that might account for the disparity: first, what he called the \\"politically correct\\" explanation, or socioeconomic disparities and historical injustices towards blacks; second, a \\"political incorrect\\" explanation, or \\"lower black IQs\\". James Gill wrote in the Times-Picayune that the lecture \\"ignited a furor\\", resulting in the president of the university, Reverend Brian F.

And, although many people blame highway deaths on alcohol, unsafe vehicles, or speeding, Block lays the blame on the government officials who manage the highway system. \\"It may well be that speed and alcohol are deleterious to safe driving; but it is the road manager's task to ascertain that the proper standards are maintained with regard to these aspects of safety.

Building on the libertarian stand against trespass and murder, Block supports a right to the first act, but, except in certain circumstances, not the second act. Block believes the woman may legally abort if the fetus is not viable outside the womb, or the woman has announced to the world her abandonment of the right to custody of the fetus, and no one else has \\"homesteaded\\" that right by offering to care for the fetus. * Walter Block, Compromising the Uncompromisable: A Private Property Approach to Resolving the Abortion Controversy, Walter Block personal web site, originally published in Appalachian Journal of Law, Vol. 4:1. * Jakub Bozydar Wisniewski, \\"A Critique of Block on Abortion and Child Abandonment\\", LibertariansPapers.org, project of Ludwig Von Mises Institute, Vol. 2, Art.

On LewRockwell.com, he criticized Randy Barnett's Wall Street Journal editorial on presidential candidate Ron Paul and on foreign policy. = Animal rights = Block believes that the libertarian non-aggression principle does not apply to animals and that the right of human owners to kill, torture, or otherwise abuse animals may be an unavoidable corollary of libertarian premises. He articulated this position in a 2017 debate on animal rights, maintaining that groups must be able to petition for rights and respect the rights of others in order to qualify for rights themselves.

Structure and function  TSG-6 is a 30 kDa secreted protein that contains a hyaluronan- binding LINK domain a and thus is a member of the hyaluronan-binding protein family, also called hyaladherins. The hyaluronan-binding domain is known to be involved in extracellular matrix stability and cell migration. This protein has been shown to form a stable, covalent complex with inter-alpha-inhibitor (IŒ±I), and thus enhance the serine protease inhibitory activity of IŒ±I, which is important in the protease network associated with inflammation. The expression of this gene can be induced by a number of signalling molecules, principally tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNF-Œ±) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). The expression can also be induced by mechanical stimuli in vascular smooth muscle cells, and is found to be correlated with proteoglycan synthesis and aggregation. TSG-6 has been shown to modulate macrophage plasticity and signal the transition of LPS-treated macrophages from pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotype. TSG-6 also interacts with a number of matrix associated molecules such as aggrecan, versican, thrombospondin (1&2), pentraxin-3 and fibronectin.

He and three other boys were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United Football Club. Moeketsi was murdered on 1 January 1989, the only one of the boys to be killed. Activism Moeketsi joined the street uprising against Apartheid in April 1985 at age ten, and soon took on a leading role. He became the country's youngest political detainee when he spent his 12th birthday in jail without trial. At the age of 13 he was expelled from school. Murder Moeketsi, together with Kenny Kgase, Pelo Mekgwe and Thabiso Mono, were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 from the Methodist manse in Orlando, Soweto, the home of Methodist minister, Paul Verryn. Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer. Screams were heard as Stompie Moeketsi was murdered, at the age of 14, by Jerry Vusumusi Richardson, member of Winnie Mandela's \\"Football Club\\". His body was recovered on waste ground near Winnie Mandela's house on 6 January 1989. His throat had been cut. Jerry Vusumusi Richardson, one of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was convicted of the murder. He stated that she had ordered him, with others, to abduct the four youths from Soweto, of whom Moeketsi was the youngest.Fred Brigland: Katiza's journey. Beneath the surface of South Africa's shame. London, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1997. The four were severely beaten. Involvement of Winnie Mandela In 1991, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault, but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine and a two-year suspended sentence on appeal. Mandela's role was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, in 1997.\\"Winnie may face fresh murder charge\\", The Independent, 28 November 1997 This incident became a cause c√©l√®bre for the apartheid government and opponents of the ANC, and Winnie Mandela's iconic status was dealt a heavy blow. Appearing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1997, she said allegations that she was involved in at least 18 human rights abuses including eight murders were \\"ridiculous\\" and said that her main accuser, former comrade Katiza Cebekhulu, was a former \\"mental patient\\" and his allegations against her were \\"hallucinations\\". Cebekhulu had, himself, before the 1991 trial, been tortured, and kidnapped to Zambia, where he was detained for almost three years, at the behest of the ANC, before moving to the UK. The Commission found that the abduction of Stompie Moeketsi had been carried out on Winnie Mandela's instructions, and that she had \\"initiated and participated in the assaults\\", had resisted efforts by the \\"Mandela Crisis Committee\\" to get the boys released, and had attempted to cover-up the death by claiming that Moeketsi had fled to Botswana. With regard to the actual murder of Seipei, the Commission found Mandela \\"negligent in that she failed to act responsibly in taking the necessary action required to avert his death\\". In February 1989, Abu Asvat, a prominent Soweto doctor,, who had examined Seipei after his abduction, was shot dead at his medical practice.\\"South Africa Police Order Full Probe Of Mandela Charge\\", The Christian Science Monitor, 9 April 1992. Winnie Mandela's alleged role in Asvat's killing was later probed as part of the TRC hearings, after Asvat's murderers as well as her associate, Katiza Cebekhulu implicated her in the murder of Asvat, as part of a cover-up of Seipei's death.\\"Winnie may face fresh murder charge\\", The Independent, 28 November 1997.\\"Panel Hears Evidence Winnie Mandela Sought Doctor's Death\\", The New York Times, 2 December 1997.\\"Winnie may face fresh murder charge\\", The Independent, 28 November 1997.\\"Panel Hears Evidence Winnie Mandela Sought Doctor's Death\\", The New York Times, 2 December 1997. The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were being intimidated on Winnie Mandela's orders.Winnie hearing adjourned after intimidation claims. BBC. 1 December 1997. In a 2017 documentary, former Soweto police officer Henk Heslinga alleged that former safety minister Sydney Mufamadi had instructed him to re-open the investigation into the death of Seipei, for the purpose of charging Winnie with murder. In the documentary, Heslinga claimed that Richardson admitted during an interview that Seipei discovered he was an informant, and that he killed the child to cover his tracks. However, Mufamadi denied the allegations in the documentary, stating that Helsinga's statements were false. The documentary had been described by in a review by Vanity Fair as \\"unabashedly one-sided\\" and \\"overwhelmingly defensive\\". Commentator Max du Preez, called the decision by television station eNCA to broadcast the documentary in the week prior to Madikizela-Mandela's funeral without context a \\"serious mistake\\", and he described it as making \\"outrageous claims\\", while former TRC commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza questioned the motives of the documentary maker.

Karlbergskanalen is surrounded by trees and green spaces. Much of the character of the northern shore is dependent of the park of the nearby Karlberg Palace and the recreational space surrounding it. Along the southern shore is a walk continuing all the way to the Stockholm City Hall more than 2 km away. Parts of the residential buildings in the Stadshagen district is located next to the canal together with allotment gardens and a few older buildings, including the small but charming Mariedal palace originally built as a private residence in 1849.Vattenprogram, Stockholm Vatten, p 20.3 Coordinates are: .  History  Originally dug in 1832-1833, the canal was made 600 ell in length and 6 feet in depth. During the first decade, less than 400 ships and barges, and some 4,000 rowing boats annually found use for it. The remain of the watercourse was dredged during the 1840s and the entire canal subsequently deepened during the 1860s to between 2.97-5.94 metres.

Ozone is the location of Ozone Falls State Natural Area, which was established in 1973 to protect Ozone Falls, a 110-foot (33 m) plunge waterfall, and its surrounding gorge. Geography Ozone is located at (35.88194, -84.80917). The community is situated atop the Cumberland Plateau, roughly five miles west of the plateau's eastern escarpment at Walden Ridge and five miles east of the Crab Orchard Mountains. Fall Creek passes through the western part of Ozone before spilling over Ozone Falls and cutting a gorge that forms the community's southern boundary. Both Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 70 traverse Ozone, connecting the area with Knoxville to the east and Nashville to the west. History What is now Ozone was once situated along the stage route built in the late 18th century between Knoxville and Nashville. Around 1806, the widow of Elijah Haley, an early Cumberland settler, established a tavern in the Ozone area, and would later be instrumental in the establishment of Crab Orchard Inn a few miles to the west. A small community grew up in the tavern's vicinity, although it consisted of only a few families. In 1880, when a post office was established, the community adopted the name \\"Mammy\\" after a nearby creek. In 1896, the community of Mammy changed its name to \\"Ozone,\\" which referred to the area's excellent air quality. Ozone is where Myles Horton began his practice as a popular educator in 1927, helping poor people in Ozone talk out their problems and find solutions together. This deeply informed his organizing practice and helped lead to his founding the Highlander School.\\"Myles Horton,\\" 13 February 2007. Retrieved: 12 March 2008.

Background Information Project Dakota came about from seeing the need for a better method to update multiple school computers at once, and to keep track of the status of all computers. Project Dakota achieved this by creating text files that were uploaded to the schools server according to their hostname. When the project was adapted for general use, the project still generated the text file, but uploaded it to an FTP server with details about the hardware and what updates were installed.

In this project, Alaeff asked different musicians such as Chi2 Strings and Moby to score the same 4 minute video of a young girl crying (singer Suzanne Santo of Honey Honey) which was then played in a loop such that each viewer had a different experience of the piece such as \\"pathos, anxiety, pity and, in our attempt to give meaning to such seemingly unmediated emotion, an imagined internal narrative of heartbreak at the end of summer or an accident on the highway.\\" As a whole Alaeff's work is meant to be interactive, speaking directly or indirectly to the viewer or allowing one's biases and projections to become part of the work. The documentary film series, \\"There's no place like you\\" (aka \\"Still Life with You\\") is a collection of \\"short stories,\\" begun in 1994 and spanning 16 years, which is devoted to his \\"idiosyncratic, exuberantly complicated relatives.\\" The series \\"documents the harmony and discord that typifies family dynamics.\\" Films in the series, \\"Believe,\\" \\"Goin' Down to Mexico,\\" \\"Works Like a Dream,\\" \\"All is Vanity,\\" and \\"Once.\\" = Bibliography = I'll be Dead by the Time You Read This: The Existential Life of AnimalsPlume/Penguin Group, 2011 (Plume/Penguin Books) Stuck-up Piece of Crap: Stickers: From Punk Rock to Contemporary Art.

When the school opened with the spring semester of the 1965 - 1966 school year, it served both grades 7 - 9 and grades 10-12. There was no junior high school in the area, so the new school was designed to accommodate both junior and senior high school students. In 1974, a court ordered the almost 100% white school, along with the rest of Denver's school system, to begin desegregation busing. A large portion of the former attendance area was assigned to Lincoln High School (without buses) and students from other parts of Denver were assigned to Kennedy (with buses).

She sang with several companies and later formed her own company. Early years and education Emma Johanna Antonia Juch was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, in 1863 during a visit by her parents, who were naturalized U.S. citizens. Her father, Justin Juch (more properly, Von Juch), was a Vienna-born musician, music professor, artist, and inventor. Her mother, Augusta (Hahn) Juch, was of French Hanoverian origin. Juch's parents resided in Detroit, Michigan, and Juch was born when they returned to Austria for the settlement of the estate of Juch's grandfather, General Von Juch. Juch was also of Italian descent. Juch's parents returned to the United States when Juch was still an infant. She was raised in New York City, where she attended public school course and graduated from the Normal School in 1879. Her singing ability was inherited from her maternal grandmother and her mother, who were both gifted singers. Martin Juch at first disapproved of a professional musical career for his daughter, so Juch took lessons and practiced secretly. She studied for three years with Adelina Murio-Celli d‚ÄòElpeux, and made her debut in a concert in Chickering Hall. When her father heard his daughter sing at this concert, he experienced a change of heart and thereafter encouraged her and supervised her training. Emma Juch, ca. 1893. Musical career Juch was admired in the United States and England during a grand opera and concert career spanning thirteen years. Biographer Oscar Thompson wrote of Juch that \\"her voice was one of unusually lovely quality and extraordinary purity.\\" She could sing in four different languages, but her singing in English was especially praised for its clarity. Juch also sang proficiently in German, Italian, and French. She made her debut as Philine in Mignon in June 1881 two months after Colonel James Henry Mapleson engaged her to sing leading soprano roles in Her Majesty's Grand Italian Opera in London, England. She made her United States debut in October of the same year at the Academy of Music in New York City. She subsequently appeared as Violetta in Verdi's La traviata, as Queen of Night in Mozart'sThe Magic Flute, as Martha in Flotow's Martha, as Marguerite in Gounod's Faust, as the Queen in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, and as Isabella in Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable. She sang during three seasons under Colonel Mapleson's management. When her contract lapsed, she refused to renew it. In June 1882, she received favorable notices when she returned to New York to take part in a memorial concert to raise funds for the families of operatic bass George Conly and virtuoso pianist Herman Rietzel, both recently drowned in a boating accident. After her contract with Col. Mapleson lapsed, William Steinway introduced her to the conductor Theodore Thomas, and she accepted an offer to tour with the Wagnerian artists Amalie Materna, Christina Nilsson, Hermann Winkelmann, and Emil Scaria. Juch sang alternate nights with Nilsson as Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin. Juch was the first singer contracted by the American Opera Company in 1886. During three seasons with that company, she sang in six roles on over 150 occasions. The operas presented included The Magic Flute, Faust, Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice, Rubinstein's Nero, and Wagner's Lohengrin and The Flying Dutchman. When American Opera Company dissolved, she formed the Emma Juch Grand English Opera Company, which toured the United States and Mexico. Her company opened in Faust at the Grand Opera House in Los Angeles on the night of January 6, 1890. Juch sang in four of the seven operas performed by the company, which had been on tour for ten weeks. The New York World complimented her on making great strides in singing the part of Marguerite since her tenure with the American Opera Company. A critic said \\"her impersonation of Marguerite is most delicate and charming,\\" and particularly \\"the garden scene, most poetic.\\" Juch designed some of her costumes herself. The Library of Congress holds one recording from 1904 (see External Links). Personal life She married Francis Lewis Wellman, a lawyer, on 25 June 1894 at Stamford, Connecticut. She gave up her career after her marriage. Juch and Wellman divorced in 1911. Death Juch died at her home, 151 East 80th Street, in New York City, in 1939. She was 78 and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while at a movie theater. Juch had not performed in public for nearly forty-four years before her death.

In October the same year the BTU was joined by other craft associations. The BTU received support from the British Labour Research Department and the British section of the League against Imperialism. In the fall of 1929, BTU led a 3-week strike and membership grew rapidly that by April 1930 membership stood at around 1,000. Later, the BTU was torn apart by internal divisions. In 1932 Small was challenged for the union's leadership by J. L. Njie. The conflict had both political and ethnic aspects (Njie was a Wolof). Njie had the support of the conservative elites of the city, who were uncomfortable with Small's activism. In March 1933, Njie registered the BTU with himself as its chairman. Small tried to regain power of the BTU for two years, but in May 1935 he broke away and formed the Gambia Labour Union instead.Hughes, Arnold ; Perfect, David.

Orchids in this genus are epiphytic or lithophytic plants with large, fleshy pseudobulbs, each with up to three leathery leaves and small, often hairy flowers. These orchids are found from tropical Asia to northern Australia. Description Orchids in the genus are epiphytic or lithophytic herbs with thread-like roots and relatively large, fleshy pseudobulbs that are usually covered by papery bracts when young. Each pseudobulb has up to three flat, usually leathery leaves. The flowers are usually white, cream-coloured or pinkish, do not open widely and last for up to a few days. The dorsal sepal is free but the lateral sepals are fused to the base of the column. The petals are free from each other and usually smaller than the sepals. The labellum often has three lobes, in which case the side lobes are erect. Taxonomy and naming The genus Bryobium was first formally described in 1836 by John Lindley who published the description in A natural system of botany, or, A systematic view of the organization, natural affinities, and geographical distribution, of the whole vegetable kingdom. The name Bryobium is derived from the Ancient Greek words bryon meaning \\"moss\\" and bios meaning \\"life\\", an apparent reference to the habit of plants in this genus. =Species list= The following is a list of species in the genus Bryobium accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: * Bryobium dischorense (Schltr.)

Previously the genus contained also a large number of marine dinoflagellate species. However, these marine species have now been assigned to a new genus called Tripos. Ceratium dinoflagellates are characterized by their armored plates, two flagella, and horns. They are found worldwide and are of concern due to their blooms.  Taxonomy  The genus was originally published in 1793 by Shrank, F. von Paula. The taxonomy of Ceratium varies among several sources. One source states the taxonomy as: Kingdom Chromista, Phylum Miozoa, Class Dinophyceae, Order Gonyaulacales, and Family Ceratiaceae. Another source lists the taxonomy as Kingdom Protozoa, Phylum Dinoflagellata, Class Dinophyceae, Order Gonyaulacales, and Family Ceratiaceae. The taxonomic information listed on the right includes Kingdom Chromalveolate. Thus, sources disagree on the higher levels of classification, but agree on lower levels.  Appearance  Ceratium hirundinella. Ceratium species are characterized by their horns and two flagella located in the transverse and longitudinal positions. Ceratium tripos is recognisable by its U-shaped horns Ceratium species belong to the group of dinoflagellates known as dinophysiales, meaning they contain armored plates. They contain a pellicle, which is a shell, that is made from the cell membrane and vesicles; vesicles are composed of cross-linked cellulose, forming the plates. The pellicle divides into two structures known as the epicone and hypocone that lie above and below the transverse groove, the cingulum, respectively. Two rows of plates surround the epicone and hypocone in a particular pattern that may be inherited by offspring. These patterns may be used to identify groups of dinoflagellates or even species of Ceratium. The plates contain expanded horns, which is a characteristic feature of Ceratium species. Species tend to have different shaped horns depending whether they are freshwater or marine species. Their morphology depends on the temperature and salinity of the surrounding environment. Species can be identified based on the shape of their horns. For instance, the species Ceratium tripos has horns that are U-shaped. Species of Ceratium contain two flagella of different lengths that are orientated in the transverse and longitudinal positions. The transverse flagellum is structurally complex and wraps around the cingulum. The movement of the flagellum is described as \\"wave-like\\" and allows the organism to spin as it swims. The longitudinal flagellum extends from a groove known as the sulcus, and this flagellum is simpler in structure than the transverse flagellum. The movement of this flagellum pulls the organism forward, but ultimately its movement is controlled by the viscosity of the water. Species of Ceratium have other structures called chromatophores, which contain red, brown, and yellow pigments used for photosynthesis. The average size of a Ceratium dinoflagellate is between 20‚Äì200 ¬µm in length, which classifies it as belonging to the microplankton size category.  Life cycle = Reproduction = Ceratiums have zygotic meiosis in their alternation of generation. Ceratium dinoflagellates may reproduce sexually or asexually. In asexual reproduction, the pellicle (shell) pulls apart and exposes the naked cell. The cell then increases in size and divides, creating 4‚Äì8 daughter cells, each with two flagella. The nuclear membrane is present throughout the process and the centrioles are not present, unlike many other eukaryotic organisms. The nuclear membrane only divides when the waist of the organism constricts. In sexual reproduction, the cells of two organisms couple close to their sulci (longitudinal groove). Meiosis occurs, which allows the chromosomes given by the haploid parents to pair. Then diploid offspring, known as \\"swarmers\\", are released. = Growth = Species of Ceratium are mixotrophic, meaning they are both photosynthetic and heterotrophic, consuming other plankton. Ceratium dinoflagellates have a unique adaptation that allows them to store compounds in a vacuole that they can use for growth when nutrients become unavailable. They are also known to move actively in the water column to receive maximum sunlight and nutrients for growth. Another adaptation that helps growth includes the ability to extend appendages during the day which contain chloroplasts to absorb light for photosynthesis. At night, these organisms retract these appendages and move to deeper layers of the water column.  Distribution and habitat = Geographic = Species of Ceratium are found across high and low latitudes, but are commonly found in temperate latitudes. Marine species found in warmer tropical seas in lower latitudes tend to have more branched horns than marine species found in the cold waters of higher latitudes. The warm water of the tropics is less viscous, so marine species of Ceratium contain more branched horns in order to remain suspended in the water column. The main function for the horns is to maintain buoyancy. = Seasonal = As lakes and ponds stratify in the summer due to a decrease in mixing, freshwater species of Ceratium tend to dominate the water column.  Ecology  Ceratium sp. are generally considered harmless and produce non-toxic chemicals. Under certain conditions that promote rapid growth of the population, Ceratium sp. blooms known as Red Tides can deplete the resources and nutrients of the surrounding environment. These blooms also deplete the dissolved oxygen in the water, which is known to cause fish kills. Fish kills result from depleting oxygen levels caused by Ceratium blooms. These dinoflagellates play important roles at the base of the food web. They are sources of nutrients for larger organisms and also prey on smaller organisms such as diatoms.  Human use and impact  Worldwide, especially in higher latitudes, the frequency of red tides has increased, which may be due to human impacts on the coasts in terms of pollution. As a result, dead fish from the oxygen-depleted water wash up on beaches, much to the dismay of people at resorts and hotels. The migration of these species has been impacted by global warming. Because the surface temperature of the ocean rises, these organisms move to deeper layers of the water column as they are temperature sensitive. Due to this behavior, species of Ceratium are used as biological indicators because the deeper they are found in the water column, the greater the impact from global warming.

Orchids in this genus are large epiphytic or lithophytic plants with prominent pseudobulbs, each with up to three thin, flat leaves and cup-shaped, relatively short-lived flowers with scale-like brown hairs on the outside. There are about 120 species occurring from tropical to subtropical Asia to the south-west Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Pinalia are epiphytic or lithophytic, rarely terrestrial herbs with prominent, fleshy pseudobulbs that are covered with papery brown bracts when young. Each pseudobulb has up to three thin, leathery, linear to lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are resupinate, usually cup-shaped and last for a few days. The dorsal sepal is narrower than the lateral sepals which are attached at their base to the column to form a small ledge. The labellum is hinged to the base of the column and has three relatively small lobes. Taxonomy and naming The genus Pinali was first formally described in 1826 by John Lindley who published the description in Orchidearum Sceletos. The name Pinalia is based on an unpublished name suggested by Francis Buchanan- Hamilton, derived from a Nepalese word meaning a type of forest yam. =Species list= The following is a list of Pinalia species accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as at January 2019: * Pinalia acervata (Lindl.)

He played as a member of the bands Steve and the Board, Bee Gees and Humpy Bong. In August 1969, he left Bee Gees and he was replaced by Pentangle drummer Terry Cox to record the songs for their 1970 album Cucumber Castle. Biography=Early life and acting career= Frederick Colin Petersen began his acting career at the age of seven. When he was still nine years old in late 1955, he starred in the film Smiley (released in 1956), with Ralph Richardson, but by the time he was twelve in 1958 he was forced to cease acting as his mother felt it was interfering with his education. Other film credits included The Scamp (1957), A Cry from the Streets (1958) and, much later, Barney (1976). In 1958, before his mother took him back to Australia to focus on his education,https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1692137/m1/#track/9 he was screen tested for the part of the young hero in Tiger Bay, but the part eventually went to the then 12 years old Hayley Mills instead, the part being rewritten for a girl. He attended the Humpybong State School at the same time that Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb did (they went to Scarborough State School first, and then later went to Humpybong). Petersen was in Barry's class, though they seldom crossed paths in any significant way. While at school he developed an interest in music, starting out on piano but switching to drums. (He had, however, already shown himself to be a talented drummer in the film The Scamp (1957). After leaving school he played with several bands including Steve and the Board, and became acquainted with Maurice Gibb, who invited him to sit in on one of the Bee Gees' sessions in Sydney. He ended up becoming friends with the family and ultimately played on as many as a dozen of their early Australian sides. =1967‚Äì69: the Bee Gees= The Bee Gees in 1967. Colin is on the far right. Petersen moved to England in 1966, little knowing that the Bee Gees would soon be doing the same and they recruited him as their permanent drummer shortly afterwards ‚Äì the first non-Gibb brother to become an official member of the Bee Gees. He played on the albums Bee Gees' 1st, Horizontal, Idea, Odessa, and Cucumber Castle. He was an equal partner in the group from early in their period in the UK, and the Gibb brothers regarded his playing as essential to their sound. He and fellow band member Vince Melouney, who would play lead guitar and had also moved to the UK, had some trouble when, in the late summer of 1967, they were threatened with deportation because of an error in the way they had secured their visas. That problem was solved only by the intervention of the group's manager, Robert Stigwood, who mounted a publicity campaign that embarrassed the government into permitting them to remain in the UK. While he was a Bee Gee, he and Maurice Gibb wrote \\"Everything That Came From Mother Goose\\" with lead vocals and guitar by Colin, but it was not released and also in 1968, Petersen played drums on The Marbles' debut single \\"Only One Woman\\". As Petersen learned about the music industry, he raised questions about Stigwood's conflict of interest as the Bee Gees' manager, since Stigwood owned their recordings and publishing and was in effect their employer. According to Petersen this led to him being fired in August 1969, while the group were making a television film of Cucumber Castle. Petersen had already recorded the songs used in the film, which make up part of the album, but he is not credited on the sleeve.Melinda Bilyeu, Hector Cook, Andrew Mon Hughes, The Ultimate Biography of the Bee Gees, Omnibus Press, 2000, p. 243-246 (based on an interview in 1999) Pentangle drummer Terry Cox was brought in to complete the remainder of the drum tracks, but it is not really clear which tracks have Petersen or Cox on drums. Vince Melouney and Robin Gibb had already left the band by then, leaving just Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, and Colin Petersen. He was fired, allegedly for having lost interest in the group and missing recording sessions, and for his refusal to do any acting in the film, despite his experience in front of the cameras. As a partner in the group, however, he could not be summarily fired as though he were an employee. The result was a series of lawsuits in which, at one point ‚Äì as a ploy to get a quicker settlement from Stigwood ‚Äì he attempted to block the Bee Gees from using that name, since it was jointly owned by the partners, and he alleged that he had been illegally deprived of his share in the partnership. Petersen remained on good terms with the brothers, especially Robin Gibb, after his initial exit. =1969‚Äì70: Humpy Bong= The first musician he worked with after leaving the Bee Gees was Jonathan Kelly. Petersen produced some of his early solo singles, and in 1970 the two decided to form a band together. It was called, Humpy Bong, a two-word variation of the name of the school that Petersen and the Gibb brothers attended in Australia. As they needed additional musicians, they placed an advertisement. Tim Staffell answered and he got the job as singer and harmonica player. The trio recorded their debut single and appeared on BBC Television's Top of the Pops. Before the end of 1970 the group broke up without having played any concerts. Petersen managed Jonathan Kelly as a solo artist during the early 1970s, subsequent to Humpy Bong disbanding. He returned to Australia in 1974 where, having lost his rights to royalties after his court case against the Bee Gees, eventually became a painter residing in Sydney. He remained close to Melouney, but became bitter towards his other ex-bandmates about his lost royalties.Melinda Bilyeu, Hector Cook, Andrew Mon Hughes, The Ultimate Biography of the Bee Gees, Omnibus Press, 2000 Personal life Petersen was required to register for National Service and was called up on 11 March 1966, but he was found medically unfit to serve in the army. [National Archives of Australia ‚Äì Series J1687] Petersen described the contrasting dispositions of the Gibb brothers as follows: > \\"They have totally different personalities, Robin is a very temperamental > and very highly strung person. His music is his whole life and he is highly > sensitive to criticism. Barry is a very easy-going and receptive type. He > adapts himself to the situations he finds himself in at the time. He is very > interested in the potential acting possibilities of the group. I think he > would like to be a film star more than a singer. Maurice is closer to my > attitudes and ideas. He has the same kind of humour as I have. We have other > common interests like playing chess. He's the kind of guy who will come over > and give you a hand washing the car. As brothers, they really have very > little in common, except the feeling that they are living for the day\\". On 1 June 1968, Petersen married Joanne Newfield in Nassau, Bahamas, with fellow Bee Gees member Vince Melouney as the best man. Joanne had worked as a personal assistant to Brian Epstein up until his death, and then for Robert Stigwood. After the couple's wedding Petersen and Newfield went on honeymoon in Majorca, which was spoiled somewhat when Joanne fell ill with German measles. In 1969, Petersen and his wife began a management company. Colin and Joanne have two sons Jaime, born 1971 and Ben born 1976. The family emigrated to Australia December 1974. The Bee Gees' manager Robert Stigwood said about Petersen: > \\"Colin is a very level-headed person, despite being a racing car enthusiast. > He's a very sophisticated person. He has a good appreciation of good food > and wines. He's 100 per cent professional in everything he does and he's an > old professional like the Gibbs because he's been in entertainment as a > child as they were, too\\" Discography=With the Bee Gees= *Spicks and Specks (1966) (on other songs) *Bee Gees' 1st (1967) *Horizontal (1968) *Idea (1968) *Odessa (1969) *Cucumber Castle (1970) (on some tracks, uncredited) =With Humpy Bong= * \\"Don't You Be Too Long\\" / \\"We're All Right Till Then\\" (1970) * \\"Don't You Believe It\\" (1970) ReferencesExternal links * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Australian male child actors Category:Australian male film actors Category:Australian drummers Category:Male drummers Category:Bee Gees members Category:People from Kingaroy Category:Australian rock drummers Category:Australian expatriates in the United Kingdom ","title":"Colin Petersen"},{"id":"15044682","text":"Shops in the town center Shops in the town center Sahowala is a town in Sambrial Tehsil, Sialkot District, Punjab, Pakistan.

Its central features were first suggested in Herbert A. Wichelns' \\"The Literary Criticism of Oratory\\" in 1925. It focused on analyzing the methodology behind a speech's ability to convey an idea to its audience. In 1943, Neo- Aristotelianism was further publicized, gaining popularity after William Norwood Brigance published A History and Criticism of American Public Address. Unlike rhetorical criticism, which concentrates on the study of speeches and the immediate effect of rhetoric on an audience, Neo-Aristotelianism \\"led to the study of a single speaker because the sheer number of topics to cover relating to the rhetor and the speech made dealing with more than a single speaker virtually impossible. Thus, various speeches by different rhetors related by form of topic were not included in the scope of rhetorical criticism.\\" \\"The Literary Criticism of Oratory\\" Wichelns' work was one of the first that introduced Neo-Aristotelianism. It narrowed down speech to 12 key topics to be studied, similar to many of the topics discussed by Aristotle in the Rhetoric. His topics for speech critique include: * Speaker's personality * Character of the speaker (how the audience views a speaker) * Audience * Major ideas * Motives to which the speaker appealed * Nature of the speaker's proof (credibility) * Speaker's judgment of human nature in the audience * Arrangement * Mode of expression * Speech preparation * Delivery * Effect of the discourse on the immediate audience and long-term effects According to Mark S. Klyn, author of Towards a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism, \\"The Literary Criticism of Oratory\\" provided \\"substance and structure to a study which heretofore had been formless and ephemeral [...] it literally created the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism.\\" Thus regardless of the lack of detail on these topics, it provided a modern structure of critiquing and analyzing speech via Neo-Aristotelianism, according to Donald C. Bryant.

But he made just four more league appearances for them after this. He spent time on loan with Halifax Town in 1992‚Äì93 and then had a memorable temporary spell with Chester City in the closing stages of the following season. He scored seven times in 11 appearances to help clinch promotion for the Blues, including a last-gasp winner against promotion rivals Preston North End in April 1994. Lancashire was recalled to Burnley shortly before the season ended and was an unused substitute in their play-off final victory over Stockport County at Wembley Stadium. Lancashire moved to Preston for ¬£55,000 in December 1994, but was to make just six appearances when the club won the Division Three title the following season. In April 1996 he was transferred for ¬£35,000 to Wigan Athletic, where he had played on loan in the previous months scoring 3 goals in 4 games. Unfortunately he had another knee injury in his first match after signing for them full-time, away at Lincoln City.

The toponym is derived from a possessive form of the Slavic personal name *Dragom—ä, with the elliptical meaning 'Dragom—ä's (village)'. History Straw plaiting was an important industry in Dragomelj before the First World War. A fish farm was established in the southeast part of the village, along Gobov≈°ek Creek, in 1933.

The oceanarium tries to make the bottom and the surroundings as authentic as possible, however with the appropriate compromises. =Theme tanks= In addition to the centre tank and habitat tanks the oceanarium has a large number of theme-tanks with fish or other marine animals, which may contain animals which are impossible to show in other tanks, or animals subject to special theme exhibitions; an example would be the exhibition \\"Creepy Crawlies\\". Here the oceanarium presents different invertebrates. With special \\"bio-scanners\\", visitors are able to see details of the animals not possible with the naked eye. Other theme-tanks contain small fish found in shallow water. In the Activity area there are tanks which staff biologists use for demonstrations. =Sealarium= In the Oceanarium's large outdoor seal pool, the Sealarium, visitors can get close to the two seal species common in Danish waters ‚Äì the harbour seal and the grey seal.

Hosaki-Menma, an ear of Menma bamboo. is a Japanese condiment made from lacto-fermented bamboo shoots.

Menma is primarily produced in China, with brands imported from southern China and Taiwan being popular. Menma is also known as , \\"Chinese bamboo\\". Etymology The trading company that would later become Marumatsu Bussan had been exporting dried bamboo shoots produced in Taiwan as shinachiku. In 1946, responding to a formal objection to the use of the term Shina from the Taiwanese government, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a memorandum recommending that the term be avoided.See :wikisource:ÊîØÈÇ£„ÅÆÂëºÁ®±„ÇíÈÅø„Åë„Çã„Åì„Å®„Å´Èóú„Åô„Çã‰ª∂ Marumatsu Bussan founder Sh≈´sui Matsumura claims that he came up with the new product name menma, a portmanteau of ramen (ÊãâÈ∫∫) and machiku (È∫ªÁ´π), the type of bamboo from which it is made, after seeing it served atop ramen in Yokohama Chinatown.

Overview \\"And his ships went sailing, sailing\\", 1899, from \\"The Saga of King Olaf\\" \\"The Saga of King Olaf\\" is written in twenty-two parts and follows the adventures of King Olaf of Norway, spurred to avenge his slain father and reclaim his kingdom by the Norse god Thor. It is the longest section of Longfellow's 1863 book Tales of a Wayside Inn, where it is presented as \\"The Musician's Tale\\". The Musician, in turn, is Longfellow's tribute to Norwegian violinist Ole Bull.Irmscher, Christoph. Longfellow Redux. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2006: 191. . It is also the oldest part of the book; Longfellow began writing it as early as 1856.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 233. . Longfellow scholar Christoph Irmscher notes it as \\"one of Longfellow's most accomplished tales\\". The diversity of meters in the 22-part sequence also displays Longfellow's virtuosity as a poet. The content of the poems draws heavily from the Heimskringla and ultimately implies little difference between the symbols of Thor's hammer and Christ's cross. Longfellow's friend and fellow writer Nathaniel Hawthorne was particularly pleased by \\"The Saga of King Olaf\\". He wrote to him particularly of the segment of \\"The Building of the Long Serpent\\": \\"By some inscrutable magic you contrive to suggest a parallel picture of a modern frigate.\\"Hansen, Harry.

He compared the inspirational nature of the poem to \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" by Julia Ward Howe. As he wrote to literary critic Martha Baker Dunn, \\"if a boy or girl likes [the Saga] well enough to learn most of it by heart and feel the spirit of it, just as they ought to like Julia Ward Howe's battle hymn, they will always have in them something to which an appeal for brave action can be made.\\"Holmes, James R.

Life aboard her when cruising in the Mediterranean in 1675-6 is described in the diary of Henry Teonge. She was rebuilt for a second time at Deptford in 1699, relaunching as a fourth rate of between 46 and 54 guns. In 1702 she was attached to the squadron of Commodore John Leake for service to Newfoundland at the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession. Leake sent her to destroy the fortifications of the isle of Saint Pierre. Her third rebuild was carried out at Limehouse, from where she was relaunched on 16 February 1713 as a 50-gun fourth rate to the 1706 Establishment. Assistance was part of the naval task force sent to Scotland to help subdue the Jacobite rising of 1719.

Its software and services were tailored for small, medium-sized and large businesses with modules for ERP, CRM, PSA and e-commerce. Oracle Corporation acquired NetSuite for approximately US$9.3 billion in November 2016. The newly formed Oracle Netsuite business unit is managed by Executive Vice President Evan Goldberg as Oracle‚Äôs Cloud ERP for small and mid-sized enterprises.  History  NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg under the original name NetLedger, which offered web-hosted accounting software. The company was seeded with both start-up money from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison as well as a host of key staff previously employed at Oracle. The company‚Äôs Chairman and CTO and other management transitioned from Oracle to NetSuite. At one time the NetSuite solution was licensed by Oracle, branded The Oracle Small Business Suite, however, that experience was short lived and the program was cancelled. NetSuite is widely seen as the first cloud computing software company, with the company‚Äôs 1999 founding pre-dating that of Salesforce.com by about a month. Goldberg was the chairman and chief technology officer up until the Oracle acquisition. In July 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO. Prior to joining NetSuite, Nelson ran an early provider of business applications over the Internet called MyCIO.com, a division of McAfee Corp. This experience led him to the belief that all software would be delivered over the internet, and he left McAfee to join NetSuite. He led the company from about $1 million in revenue to a billion-dollar run-rate prior to its acquisition by Oracle Corp. On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane (of Moneyball fame) to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company. NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007. One quarter of employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York City, Boston, Toronto, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and Uruguay.  Relationship with Oracle Corporation  In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures. Other initial investors were StarVest Partners, ADP and UBS PaineWebber. The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle. Ellison and family members owned approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, stated that \\"Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation.\\" On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion. The deal faced intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owned nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, notified Oracle they would not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4. The deal closed Nov. 7.  Products, services and support NetSuite offers four main pieces of software and optional implementation and support services: * Enterprise resource planning (ERP) - NetSuite ERP supports back office operations which includes financial, human resources, procurement, orders, inventory, shipping and billing. *NetSuite OneWorld offers the ability to manage multiple subsidiaries, currencies, accounting standards and tax requirements. * Customer relationship management (CRM) ‚Äì NetSuite CRM+ supports marketing, sales and service operations, and customer insights. * E-commerce - NetSuite's SuiteCommerce is intended as a platform for online sales and integration with traditional phone and point of sale (POS) tools. *Professional services automation (PSA) - NetSuite PSA is based on the OpenAir acquisition and manages the operations of service-based, project-oriented businesses. * Human capital management (HCM) - NetSuite SuitePeople controls core human resources and payroll processes. * Netsuite Services: SuitePackages offers basic implementation services for customers, Packaged Services offers customization and integration of the Netsuite solutions, and Suite Support offers online help and support in case of issues.

Woodhay station served the villages of Enborne and Enborne Row in Berkshire and Broad Laying (Woolton Hill) in the parish of East Woodhay, Hampshire. It was a considerable distance from the villages of East Woodhay and West Woodhay. The site now lies under the A34 Newbury by-pass. Facilities Like most country stations on the line it originally consisted of two platforms, the southbound platform on the passing loop. Since the station was built on a bank it was not possible to construct strong foundations for a brick-built station building. Hence this was the only station on the line with a wooden station building located on the southbound platform. Two sidings and a headshunt were built to the south of the station for goods. These were primarily used for horses and wood cut from nearby pine forests. Accidents and incidents *In December 1957, a freight train overran signals and was derailed by trap points.

This article describes the obscure script from Laos that Sidwell (2008) and Jacq (2001) have described under the name \\"Khom script\\". Samples of symbols from the Khom script, showing how it creates syllables This Khom script is unique in the way it divides syllables. It has one set of symbols to represent initial consonants. Then it uses another set of symbols to represent the final vowel and consonant. That is, unlike a syllabary (which has unitary symbols for consonants followed by vowels (CV), with maybe a vowelless consonant following), Khom script divides the syllable as C-VC, rather than CV-C (Sidwell 2008). This is unique, not readily accommodated in any of the existing typologies of scripts. The script was invented by Ong Kommadam, a leader in the rebellion against the French colonizers. He began using the script as early as 1924, but its use did not continue after his death in 1936. Ong Kommadam claimed supernatural titles, including ‚ÄúKing of the Khom‚Äù, ‚ÄúGod of the Khom‚Äù, ‚ÄúSky God of the Khom‚Äù (Sidwell 2008:17). The script was linked to his divine claims, messages written in this script carried mystical power as well as meaning. The script was revealed to outsiders by old, dying insiders on two separate occasions (Sidwell 2008). Some of the symbols resemble those from nearby scripts, but many are original. The script contains more than 300 characters, in order to fully encompass the rich morphology of the Bahnaric languages. The term \\"Khom\\" is also used to refer to the Ancient Khmer lettering used in Thailand's Buddhist temples to inscribe sacred Buddhist mantras and prayers, but that is an entirely different script. The script could be used to write various Bahnaric languages, including the Laven dialects, especially Jru', and languages like Alak, Ong Kommadam's native language. References *Jacq, Pascale. 2001.

Its varieties can be found in a range of habitats as epiphytes (on branches or trunks of trees) or lithophytes. It has a continuous distribution along the east coast of Australia and in distinct populations along the Tropic of Capricorn. As a lithophyte, it forms gigantic spreading colonies on rocks and cliff faces, often exposed to full sun, with its roots forming dense, matted beds across the rock that anchor the plant. It can be found at altitudes from sea level to .  Description  Dendrobium speciosum is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with spreading roots and cylindrical or tapered pseudobulbs long and wide. Each pseudobulb has up to seven, usually thick, leathery leaves originating from its top, the leaves long and wide. The leaves can remain on the plant for up to twelve years. The flowers vary in colour from white to bright yellows and there is considerable variation in the length of the flowering raceme, the number of flowers on it and the size of the flowers. The length of the flowering stem ranges from long and the number of flowers from two to two hundred. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is longer than the lateral sepals but narrower and the petals are about the same length as the lateral sepals but only half as wide. The labellum has reddish purple spots or streaks and three lobes, the sides lobes erect and curved and the middle lobe pointed, rounded or more or less square. Flowering occurs between August and October for most varieties but some flower as early as May and others as late as November. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium speciosum was first formally described in 1804 by James Edward Smith from a specimen found at Port Jackson and sent to him by John White. The description was published in Exotic Botany. The specific epithet (speciosum) is a Latin word meaning \\"beautiful\\", \\"splendid\\" or \\"showy\\". Dendrobium speciosum is a variable species and the following varieties are recognised by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: * Dendrobium speciosum var. blackdownense P.B.Adams which is usually a lithophyte, with between 14 and 113 off-white to deep golden yellow flowers from August to November and occurring on the Blackdown Tableland; * Dendrobium speciosum var. boreale P.B.Adams, Jac.M.Burke & S.D.Lawson which is epiphytic or lithophytic, with between 9 and 125, star-like, widely opening, off-white to cream-coloured flowers from July to September and has the most northerly distribution of the species, from the Annan River to near Townsville; * Dendrobium speciosum var. capricornicum Clemesha ‚Äì commonly known as the Capricorn rock orchid, which is usually a lithophyte with between 30 and 50 white flowers between May and August and is found between the Byfield Range, Yeppoon and Rockhampton; * Dendrobium speciosum var. carnarvonense P.B.Adams ‚Äì commonly known as the gorge pink rock orchid, which grows in gorges near streams and has between 2 and 7 relatively small, pale pink flowers between August and November and is only found between Carnarvon Gorge and Isla Gorge; * Dendrobium speciosum var. curvicaule F.M.Bailey ‚Äì commonly known as the rainforest rock orchid, which is an epiphyte or lithophyte growing in or near rainforest and has between 25 and 45 white or cream-coloured flowers from July to September and grows between Mossman and Paluma in Queensland; * Dendrobium speciosum var. grandiflorum F.M.Bailey ‚Äì commonly known as the golden king orchid and which grows on trees or rocks and has between 50 and 150 relatively large, creamy yellow to bright yellow flowers from August to October and is found from the Calliope Range to the Bunya Mountains in Queensland; * Dendrobium speciosum var. hillii Mast. ‚Äì commonly known as the pale king orchid and which grows on trees and rocks and has between 70 and 200 crowde white or cream-coloured flowers from August to October and grows between Maleny in Queensland to Mangrove Mountain in New South Wales; * Dendrobium speciosum var. pedunculatum Clemesha ‚Äì commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid which grows on rocks and has between 10 and 30 crowded white or cream-coloured flowers from July to August and occurs between the Mount Windsor National Park and the Evelyn Tableland in Queensland; * Dendrobium speciosum Sm. var. speciosum ‚Äì commonly known as the Sydney rock orchid or rock lily which is a lithophyte with between 30 and 100 crowded cream-coloured or dull yellow flowers between August and October and occurs between Bulahdelah and near the Victorian border and as far inland as Mudgee.

Flowers vary in size within the six recognised varieties of D. speciosum and are pollinated when visited by bees of appropriate size.  Natural hybrids  Dendrobium speciosum forms a natural hybrid with Dendrobium gracilicaule : Dendrobium √ó gracillimum. This hybrid has also been described as Dendrobium speciosum var. nitidum , Dendrobium √ó nitidum , Dendrobium speciosum var. bancroftianum and Dendrobium jonesii subsp. bancroftianum . Use in horticulture This orchid is popular in cultivation, growing into a large specimen that does well outdoors in climates with a mild winter. It may be grown in an open, coarse orchid growing medium, on a sturdy tree with an open canopy, or as a terrestrial in a well-drained position. It requires very bright light to full sun. Watering is year round in moderation. It is very temperature tolerant as long as it receives good warmth during the growing season. Frost, however, can cause extensive defoliation, an event the plant may require years to recover from. In cultivation D. speciosum can develop extremely large pseudobulbs, and benefits from regular fertilisation. Even in ideal cultivation conditions it may not flower every year, especially so in plants from more southern populations.

American pioneers are any of the people in American history who migrated west to join in settling and developing new areas. The term especially refers to those who were going to settle any territory which had previously not been settled or developed by European, African or American society, although the territory was inhabited by or utilized by Native Americans. The pioneer concept and ethos greatly predate the migration to the Western United States, with which they are commonly associated, and many places now considered \\"East\\" were settled by pioneers from even further east. For example, Daniel Boone, a key figure in American history, settled in Kentucky, when that \\"Dark and Bloody Ground\\" was still undeveloped. One important development in the Western settlement was the Homestead Act, which provided formal legislation for the settlers which regulated the settlement process. Etymology The word \\"pioneer\\" originates with the Middle French pionnier (originally, a foot soldier, or soldier involved in digging trenches), from the same root as peon or pawn.Philip Durkin, \\"Lexical borrowing, 5.1 Basic concepts and terminology\\" in The Oxford Guide to Etymology (2011), ch. 5, p. 134, 138. In the English language, the term independently evolved a sense of being an innovator or trailblazer. As early as 1664, Englishman John Evelyn used the term with a self-effacing \\"workman\\" meaning when he wrote in his treatise on planting, Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees: \\"I speak now in relation to the Royal Society, not my self, who am but a Servant of it only and a Pioneer in the Works\\".John Evelyn, Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber (1664), p. 2. Pioneers Various figures in American folklore and literature typify the pioneer. James Fenimore Cooper's The Deerslayer (1841) became the most successful of his early series, the Leatherstocking Tales, about pioneer life in the Province of New York. Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie series, published a century later in 1932‚Äì1943 but set in the 1870s and 1880s, typified later depictions of pioneer families. Daniel Boone (1734‚Äì1820) and Davy Crockett (1786‚Äì1836) became two real-life icons of pioneer history. Historic details and episodes=History of settlement efforts= The first westward migrations occurred as representatives of the Thirteen Colonies sought to open up new lands for their respective colonies westward. Those whose original royal charters did not specify a western limit simply extended their lands directly and indefinitely westward. right After the United States was formed upon the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, federal coordination and legislation began to give settlement a more unified approach. The Land Ordinance of 1785 was the first official action by the federal government in deciding how political organization of new territories would be handled. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 was a major step, declaring that states could not individually claim new lands, but exploration would be handled by the national U.S. government. In the Land Act of 1804, the federal government took its first steps towards legislating the manner in which pioneer lands would be individually claimed and distributed. Further evidence of the government's involvement in encouraging western settlement was the publication of The Prairie Traveler, published in 1859, three years before the Homestead Act's passage. Randolph B. Marcy, Captain of the U.S. Army was commissioned by War Department to provide a guide for those moving west. It provided not only mileage and stopping points during travel but also gave advice about what to take on the journey, how to interact with Native Americans and also how to respond to threatening situations such as encounters with bears.The Prairie Traveler by Randolph B. MacyThe Prairie Traveler, Randolph B. Macy There were many other forms of this process, such as land runs including the Land Run of 1889, in Oklahoma, which occurred when parts of the territory of Oklahoma were first opened, allowing anyone to claim land on a first-come, first-serve basis. =Details of pioneer efforts and actions= As western settlement grew, certain common details began to emerge. Most pioneers traveled in wagon trains, groups of wagons containing settlers and their families. They banded together for common defense and to combine their efforts. Pioneers in the East often had to clear the land, owing to lush forests there. In the Midwest, the task was to bring agricultural fertility to the Great Plains. Some pioneers were drawn with the original intent of claiming lands and settling their families. Others were trappers, or others who went west for commercial reasons, and remained there as residents when their businesses proved to be profitable. Popular culture and folklore The figure of the pioneer has played a large role in American culture, literature and folklore. The pioneer is not the only iconic figure which figures in the settlement of the West. Much cultural note is given to other figures of a more transient nature, such as cowboys, trappers, prospectors, miners etc. However, the pioneer alone represents those who went into unexplored territory in search of a new life, looking to establish permanent settlement. Various figures in American folklore and literature typify the pioneer. The Deerslayer was the most successful of an early series, the Leatherstocking Tales, about pioneer life in New York. Little House on the Prairie, a century later, typified a later series of novels describing a pioneer family. Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett are two real-life icons of pioneer history.

It is located near the city of Gotemba in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji. Camp Fuji is one of several Camps of the Marine Corps Base Camp Butler complex. JGSDF Camp Fuji (), namesake of this installation, is located 2.5 miles north of the USMC base. History The area around the base of Mount Fuji has been associated with the military since medieval times. The samurai of the Kamakura Shogunate conducted military training in this area in the 15th century. In the modern era, the large East Fuji Maneuver Area was established by the Imperial Japanese Army as a training facility, and several training bases were established in the area. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, these bases were occupied by the United States Army, and were designated ‚ÄúCamp Fuji McNair‚Äù, ‚ÄúNorth Camp‚Äù, ‚ÄúMiddle Camp‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSouth Camp‚Äù. Half of ‚ÄúNorth Camp‚Äù was turned over to the United States Marine Corps (USMC) in 1953, while the other half (across the street from present-day Camp Fuji) was eventually turned over to the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) where it is now JGSDF Camp Takigahara. Description Marines training at Camp Fuji in 1996. The facility includes of ranges and maneuver area to serve as a combined arms training area. Camp Fuji is under the exclusive control of the USMC, although the helicopter landing pad is a joint-use facility for both the United States and the JGSDF. Units from across the Pacific (including those participating in the Unit Deployment Program) come to Camp Fuji to train. The facilities were considered spartan compared to most military bases, with no family housing, limited military exchange and recreation facilities, and limited medical facilities, although extensive modernization and expansion programs from 1983 have added new barracks, enlisted and officers club, a barber shop, library and food facilities.

The play features a series of conversations between the cast of characters, who assemble for an apparent innocent evening dinner on July 11, 1982. This date is significant in that it was the day that Italy won the World Championship (FIFA World Cup) in Spain (Italy beat West Germany, 3-1). However, events take an odd turn, and this innocent dinner becomes a comical, unusual drama. As the soccer match takes place, another 'game' takes place on the stage between the various characters at the Oldofredi house, which Tondelli describes as \\"a cruel yet entertaining game of coups de th√©√¢tre, betrayals, revelations and ambiguity.\\" Cast of Characters *Goffredo Oldofredi (referred to as Fredo throughout the play), a lawyer *Giulia Oldofredi, wife of Fredo *Manfredi Oldofredi, (referred to as Didi throughout the play), Fredo's younger brother; a writer *Alberto Grandi, Fredo's best friend and also a friend of Didi's; an artist *Mavie di Monterassi, an editor and friend of the family *Tommy Trengrove, friend of the family and best friend to Fredo and Didi's deceased parents *Annie, an actress/transvestite hired by Fredo to impersonate Alberto's girlfriend *Jiga, Filipino maid who works for the Oldofredi Versions of the Play Five different versions of the play existed at one point before the final product, each with various differences:Tondelli, Pier Vittorio, and Fulvio Panzeri.

The organisation has chaplains and ship visitors in 91 global ports, who help seafarers and their families, from all faiths and none, with welfare and practical support. The charity has projects and services covering 30 countries. History The Chapel for Seamen - Port of London Society - Instituted March 18th 1818 - moored off Wapping Stairs in the river Thames. View of the Interior (inset) In 1817, George Charles ‚ÄòBosun‚Äô Smith called a meeting at the City of London Tavern in Bishopsgate. The meeting led to the charity's formation on 18 March 1818, as the Port of London Society. An estimated 45,000 seafarers were visiting the port of London annually and the Society moored a former sloop of war on the River Thames, the Mars, renaming it the Ark, and repurposing it as a floating chapel where seafarers could congregate and pray. Social reformer Elizabeth Fry asked the charity to send books for her to pass on to men posted at coastguard stations and the First Lord of the Treasury Robert Peel made a grant of ¬£500 to help the organisation's cause. In 1834 Sailors' Society appointed its first full-time chaplain Benjamin Prynn, as its Thames missionary, followed by a full-time missionary in Cape Town. In his first year alone, Prynn spoke to 50,000 seafarers. In 1871, with the support of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the charity set up a Sailors' Rest and Institute in Genoa. The organisation launched its magazine, Chart & Compass, in 1879. At this time, Sailors' Society's received patronage from not only the British Royal Family but also Czar Alexander III of Russia and King Umberto I of Italy. In 1902, the charity founded the King Edward VII Nautical School for 'hardy and heroic sons of the sea'. The Lords of the Admiralty donated copper and wood from HMS Victory to Sailors' Society, which the charity made into coins, plaques and busts to fundraise with. The only junior officer to die when Titanic sank in 1912, sixth officer James Paul Moody, had trained at the Society's King Edward VII Nautical School in 1910. During World War I the charity supported thousands of seafarers from torpedoed vessels. These included survivors of the SS Belgian Prince, HMHS Rewa and HMAT Warilda. In the final months of World War I, Sailors‚Äô Society supported more than 14,000 people from torpedoed ships. In 1918, Sailors‚Äô Society marked its centenary with services and meetings at Mansion House, London, the People's Palace and a Jutland Day celebration at the Royal Albert Hall on 31 May. Among those who sent messages of congratulations on the charity's centenary were King George V, Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the 28th President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson. In 1918 the Society opened new rests for seamen in Poole, Southampton, Dartmouth, Limehouse, Aberdour, Preston, Ardrossan, Rosyth, Buncrana, Bristol and Gosport. The Prince of Wales launched a special appeal to raise money for the charity's cause in 1923 and the following year, the organisation built the Empire Memorial Hostel at Limehouse, which was opened by one of Queen Victoria's granddaughters, Princess Marie Louise, so that seafarers could have a 'clean and airy' place to stay. Christmas festivities at Waterford's Sailors' Rest, 1931. Waterford, Ireland Princess Marie Louise's involvement continued a long tradition of royal endorsement and support. King George V ‚Äì the ‚ÄòSailor King‚Äô ‚Äì had been patron since 1892 and made regular donations. When he died in 1936, King Edward VIII and, on his abdication, King George VI, continued the Royal Family's connection and annual subscription to the Society. The liner SS Athenia was the first British ship torpedoed during World War II on 3 September 1939 and resulted in the loss of nearly 120 people. A further 981 were rescued, with many taken to Galway where they were tended to by, among others, Sailors' Society's chaplain. In 1939, crews from 41 ships hit by German action were cared for at the Society's stations and at the height of the conflict, the charity funded a sea ambulance to help injured seafarers. Survivors from the sinking of HMS Ark Royal were cared for at one of the charity's Sailors' Rests. British Sailors' Society (Scotland) ran a children's home, known as Lagarie Children's Home, which was located on the banks of the Gareloch on the outskirts of the village of Rhu, by Helensburgh. The Society ran the home from October 1949 until it closed in 1982. Lagarie House was built in 1901 by renowned architect Alexander Nisbet Paterson, and had a large dining room, three reception areas, offices and staff break rooms. It had a total of six dormitories and large bedrooms. The home was intended for use by seafarers whose families were in need of help with their children, be it to give the parents respite during a family crisis or in some cases a home due to the loss of a family member and the father could not manage and go to sea at the same time. It was also used to allow a seafarer to take his wife away with him for a trip while he worked. At one stage up to 60 children being cared for. The home was ran on purely charitable income. In 1956 there were an estimated 156,000 Merchant Navy men sailing under the British flag and John Mills made a televised appeal to help the charity raise ¬£150,000. The organisation had a seafarers' centre in Hamburg, which in 1960 provided welfare support to the Beatles, who recognised Sailors' Society as the same charity in their native Liverpool. The early 1960s saw the Society expand, with the opening of the first new seafarers' club in New Zealand for 25 years followed by clubs at Aden and one in Tema, Ghana. In 1968 Sailors' Society celebrated its 150th anniversary with a service at Westminster Abbey, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. During the Falklands War the Society's chaplains made more than 400 visits to anxious families. In March 1987, the Herald of Free Enterprise capsized claiming 193 lives. Chaplains from the charity supported survivors and the families of the lost, the organisation has held the annual service of remembrance in Dover ever since. In 1993, Queen Elizabeth II led the charity's 175th anniversary service, which was held at Southampton Docks and broadcast on Songs of Praise. A 3,500-strong congregation, which included Prince Andrew, took part with thousands more taking up vantage points around the docks. On 18 March 2018 the charity celebrated its 200th birthday and held a service at Southwark Cathedral on 24 April, where Prince Michael of Kent spoke about his family's longstanding links with the charity. Following mergers with two other societies, the name was changed to The British & Foreign Sailors‚Äô Society. In 1925 it was changed to The British Sailors‚Äô Society. In 1995 the name was changed to The British & International Sailors‚Äô Society. The most recent name change took place on 1 December 2007 when the present name was adopted. The Society is an interdenominational charity and has close links with many of the mainstream Protestant Churches in the United Kingdom, such as the Baptist Union, Church of Scotland, United Reformed Church, and the Methodist Church. The charity's head office is in Southampton, England. The Society is international and in addition to its presence in the UK it operates in Albania, Belgium, Brazil, Ghana, R√©union, Russia, India, Indonesia, Liberia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Myanmar, Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines and Ukraine. = Children's Home Abuse Scandal = In 2018, more than twelve former residents at the Lagarie Children's Home claimed that they were physically and sexually abused by staff while living there. Stuart Rivers (Sailor's Society chief executive) accepted that the Society should take some responsibility and stated that the Society was providing counselling for some survivors. The Society has been criticised by some of those claiming abuse, for opposing a move by the Scottish Government to remove the 'time bar' law, which prevents victims of historical abuse from bringing civil actions. Survivors are encouraged to contact the Sailors Society via their website The alleged abuse of children at Lagarie Children's Home was investigated by BBC Disclosure . The episode was broadcast on Monday 17 September. Locations The Mission in Limehouse, where Situationist International held its conference in 1960 The Society has port chaplains and seafarers' welfare centres at various ports around the world. It also has one retirement home - in Greenock, Scotland. Within the UK the Society has a presence at Aberdeen, Arbroath, Dundee, Felixstowe, Grangemouth, Leith (port of Edinburgh), Manchester Ship Canal, Milford Haven, Montrose, Portland, Dorset, Port Talbot and South Wales Ports, Portbury (near Bristol), Seaham (County Durham), Southampton and the Wirral (Mersey). In New Zealand, an independent Society, the International Sailors' Society New Zealand Incorporated, coordinates the activities of six independent seafarers' welfare organisations (all registered charities) in the ports of Auckland, Bluff, Dunedin (Otago), New Plymouth (Taranaki), Bay of Plenty (Mt Maunganui) and (since 2011) Wellington. Another in Lyttelton recently (2009) went into recess. Sailors' Society in New Zealand is linked to Sailors' Society (UK) but is self-governing and self-supporting. Independent bodies, similarly linked to the UK, also exist in South Africa and Canada. Wellness at Sea Beginning with the launch of Wellness at Sea in January 2015, the Society has since provided a number of different health and well- being initiatives, such as Health Centres in Philippines, mobile clinic in India, ear and eye testing in India and additional plans to create a psychosocial project in the Philippines. Wellness at Sea is a training programme for seafarers that equips them to improve their wellbeing while at sea. The programme also has a companion app and e-learning platform. Crisis Response Sailors‚Äô Society's Crisis Response Network provides a rapid response trauma care and counselling service for survivors of piracy attacks, natural disasters and crises at sea. The network includes over 50 crisis responders, specially trained in trauma support, and operates globally to support seafarers and their families.

It is a contraction of MacCorran or McCorran, an anglicised form of the Gaelic Mac Odhr√°in or fuller Mac GilleOdrain (from the personal name Odhran). This surname is considered to be an patronymic name, meaning \\"son of Odhran\\". The personal name Odhr√°in means \\"pale-faced\\" or \\"the little pale-faced one\\". Corrin may also represent anglicized forms of Mac Thorfinnr, which means \\"Thor's find\\", and Mac Corraidhin, meaning \\"little spear\\". The earliest form was first documented on the Isle of Man as Maktory, MacThoryngt and later rendered as either MacCorrane or McCorryn, and later reduced as Corrane, in the year 1422 and as Corrin in 1504. This name first appeared in Manx Gaelic on the Isle of Man sometime pre-13th century, but its origination can also be found in the countries of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic) and Ireland (Irish Gaelic). In Scotland, any variation of the name may be considered a sept for their associations with clans such as Clan MacDonald (MacCorran), Clan Cameron (MacOran), or Clan Campbell (also MacOran). History=Ethnic origins= Genealogists suggest that those who share this surname may be directly descended from The Britons of Strathclyde who migrated from the Kingdom of Strathclyde during the early middle ages. According to a number of articles published throughout the British Isles have concluded some evidence for migrations throughout the Isles. However, in some areas, such as in south-west Scotland, migrations were scarce and considered to be unlikely that migrations were to be taken place. While this may be the case, some genealogists have concluded that the people of the Isle of Man are genetically predominantly Scottish, and whose documented DNA are identical to those prevalent in the south-west regions of Scotland. While the earliest surviving documentary record of this name on the Isle of Man was from 1290, DNA experts were able to dig deeper into the male line to provide detailed analysis. Recent Y-DNA samples provide information about those who inhabited and lived on the Isle of Man for many centuries. According to a study (whose purpose was to analyze DNA samples from patriarchs who are native to the Isle of Man), those who bore the name of Corrin appear to be of ancient Celtic origins, as most genealogists agree that those who are native or descended from any of the Celtic nations all share similar or identical DNA. In which case, patriarchs who shared the surname of Corrin held the Y-chromosome Haplogroup R1b in DNA matches and had come to the Isle of Man from either Celtic Britain or Ireland. =Isle of Man= Peel in 1806 by a Mr. Thomas Corrin - an eccentric gentleman. Inscribed on one of the pillars: \\"Corrin's Pillar, 1850. This pillar was erected six feet distant from the base of this mount, and within the inclosure, upon its top rest the mortal remains of Alice Corrin and her two beloved children. This pillar, tower, and mount, were erected by Thomas Corrin, to perpetuate her memory until reanimated by the power of God.\\" On the Isle of Man, the name's first appearance appeared in the Parish Registers as Makory sometime in 1290 A.D. In 1293, a document concerning the \\"Outlawry of Donekan MacToryn\\" was presented to the Scottish lordships in a trial on IOM. The outlawry was considered to be \\"an error\\" in judgment and was officially annulled from the Kingdom of Scotland on the 28th of June, 1293. This took place during the time when invasions were taken place between the kingdoms of Scotland and England. In 1314, a petition to Edward II showed Duncan de MacKoury, a gentleman to Sir John of Argyll, at all times since the commencement of the war in Scotland, to show his allegiance to both Edward I and Edward II and to be granted. According to the petition, \\"His father and relations have died in the same service, all his lands, goods, and houses were destroyed by the Scots, and he himself has lived the whole of this year in Man in great distress, in the service of the King. Therefore he prays that the King will consider his estate, and grant him the ward and marriage of the body and lands of the heir of Nicholas de Ledewicke in Ireland, which are valued at twenty marks, together with the marriage of the wife of the said Nicholas, which ward belongs to the King, so that he may have a retreat for his wife and his children, so long as he remains in the service of the King\\". The request was granted. While significant sources from the Isle of Man (along with most Manx genealogists) agree that the linage of Corrins are of Celtic origin, some argue that pre-1400s documents point to a Norse source through the name of Thorfin. J.J. Keen, a historian on the Isle of Man, suggests the possibility in terms of places, such as Malew to have been given significant influences from the Norse. According to Keen, \\"It is probable that Thore the son of Asser is identifiable with Thorfin the son of Oter mentioned in the Chronicles of Man. He was a famous chieftain of the Isles in the 12th century. It is now impossible to identify the site of this estate, but it was probably in the Parish of Malew\\". The Thorfin clan is briefly mentioned in the Chronicles of Mann and the Isles: > Godred after a few days went back to Man, and dismissed the chiefs of the > Isles to their respective abodes. When he now found himself secure on his > throne, and that no one could oppose him, he began to act tyrannically > towards his chiefs, depriving some of their inheritances, and others of > their dignities. Of these, one named Thorfinn, son of Oter, more powerful > than the rest, went to Somerled, and begged for his son Dugald, that he > might make him king over the Isles. Somerled, highly gratified by the > application, put Dugald under the direction of Thorfinn, who received and > led him through all the islands, subjecting them all to him, and taking > hostages from each. While there are some similarities between the origins of Clan Corrin and Clan Thorfin (in terms of land), the differences lie within genetics that is present between these two families, instead of by name and influence on the Isle of Man. The early family seat was located in Malew in the vicinity of Rushen Abbey. This location was probably the source of the people called MacToryns before the name evolved later on pre-1400s. According to sources, the 'proto-Corrins' were most likely the McCorryns, McCoryns, and McCorrans in the 1500s onward. In Rushen, a clan based there, The Corrins of Ballagawne, was known to have held quarterland properties in the parishes of Arbory. Historically, they considered the Armstrong clan as their allies and Watsons as their rivals. =Scotland= In Scotland, The name of Corrin is derived from similar ethnic origins and can be found in the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland. In the Lowlands, they are associated with the family of McAdam, a clan based in the Scottish Lowlands, presumably in Ayrshire and/or Kirkcudbrightshire through intermarriages and alliances. Although MacAdam is a sept themselves, who have originally been branched off of Clan MacGregor in Argyllshire and Perthshire, they are a Scottish clan in their own right (there is a Clan Adam that exists). The family names of MacCorran and Mac Oran are present in other parts in Scotland, predominantly in Argyllshire. The surname of MacCorran is also derived from similar origins and is found on the islands of Islay and Colonsay in Argyllshire, where they are considered to be a sept of Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, a branch of Clan Donald (or Clan MacDonald) in the Scottish Highlands. According to the official sept list of Clan Donald, the name is derived from the Gaelic MacGille Odhrain, meaning \\"son of the servant of St. Odhran\\". In addition, there is a medieval chapel called St Oran's Chapel that is located on the island of Iona in the Inner Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland. This chapel is dedicated to Oran of Iona, who was a companion of Saint Columba in Iona. The name of Mac Oran is said to be a sept of Clan Campbell. In the sources provided by the Clan Campbell Society (North America), it is the same rendering of MacCorran, or more accurately, McCorran. According to family tradition, a young Campbell of Melfort took the alias name of McOran, after having killed a man named \\"MacColl\\" in the later seventeenth century. Having to leave Argyll, he took under the servitude of the Earl in Menteith, who in return awarded him a farm in Inchanoch. He married a Miss Haldane, the niece to Haldane of Lanrick, and the family prospered. Once they were away at sea, they reassumed the names of Campbell, having connections in Argyllshire. There appears to be a documented name of Dugald M'Corran that appears in Fernoch, Kilmelford in 1698. =Ireland= In Ireland, the name is a variation of the last name Curran, which is Gaelic for O'Corraidhin or \\"descendant of Corraidhin\\", a personal name from a diminutive form of the byname derived from \\"corradh\\", meaning \\"spear\\". Coat of Arms While heraldry is relevant throughout the British Isles, coats of arms are rather scarce on the Isle of Man and are granted to very few families, most notably direct descendants of individuals who have been granted their right to inherit their ancestor's arms from the Christian or Quayle dynasties. Heraldry for the Isle of Man is regulated through the College of Arms, which guides individuals who wish to bear their own specific coats of arms. Some heraldric organizations, however, may be much more difficult to patent arms. Those of Scottish descent may find it much more arduous to register with the Court of the Lord Lyon as Scottish Armorial Laws are more restrictive. While there is no historical record of a coat of arms for any Corrins, some families have advocated for an \\"official\\" coat of arms for the Corrin family. However, the College of Arms, Lord Lyon, (or other regulated heraldic jurisdiction) would find this inadvisable. According to laws in the United Kingdom, families cannot bear the right to an already registered coat of arms, and in Scotland, registering a similar or already pre-existing coat of arms is considered an unlawful act. College of Arms specifies that \\"Coats of arms belong to individuals. For any person to have a right to a coat of arms they must either have had it granted to them or be descended in the legitimate male line from a person to whom arms were granted or confirmed in the past\\". Meanwhile, in the United States, there is no heraldic authority and may register a coat of arms with an independent registry for an \\"official\\" copyrighted designs.

According to various martyrologies and menologion, the persecution included the burning of a church that held numerous Christians on Christmas Day. This event took place when the emperor Maximian (284-305) returned with victory over Ethiopians in 304 AD. It happened after they had refused to sacrifice to idols during Christmas Mass in order to thank gods for the victory he had acquired.20,000 Martyrs of Nicomedia Retrieved on 3 Feb 2018 Later Maximian and his soldiers entered the church and told the Christians they could escape punishment if they renounced Christ. The Christian priest Glycerius answered that the Christians would never \\"renounce their faith, even under the threat of torture\\". Maximian ordered him to be burned to death. Those who had not been burned in the church were captured and tortured to death. The bishop Anthimos who had escaped burning in the church was captured and beheaded. The number 20,000 may be apocryphal.

Plants in this genus are epiphytes, sometimes with pseudobulbs, in which case there are usually one or two leaves. Others lack pseudobulbs but have up to twelve leaves. A large number of small white or greenish flowers are borne on a flowering stem emerging from a leaf axil or from the base of the pseudobulb when present but the flowers do not open widely. There are about 220 species, distributed from tropical and subtropical Asia to the Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Phratia are epiphytic herbs similar to those in the genus Thelasis and sometimes have pseudobulbs with one or two leaves or otherwise lack pseudobulbs and have up to twelve leaves. A large number of small flowers are arranged on a flowering stem that emerges from the top of the pseudobulb when present or from a leaf axil. The flowers are resupinate, usually white or greenish and do not open widely. The sepals and petals are free from and similar to each other, but the petals are slightly smaller.

Kim began his musical training in southern California and continued his studies at The Juilliard School. At the Manhattan School of Music he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees, and went on to earn a Ph.D. from New York University. Among his teachers include Paul Jacobs, Gary Graffman, Solomon Mikowsky and Jerome Lowenthal. Besides his solo performing career as a concert pianist, Kim has also received attention for his performances with his musical family. With his wife Judith Jeon, a soprano, Kim has performed widely in lieder recitals. In 1995, he and his son Matthew Kim made their debut as a father-and-son piano duo with a sold-out performance at Carnegie Hall. The duo has expanded with the addition of Kim's younger son, James. The trio of pianists, Paul Kim & Sons, has since performed throughout the world, often in benefit concerts for various social and charitable causes. In addition to his performing career, Kim is president and co-founder of the Music Angels International Foundation. A profile of Kim's spiritual journey in music was featured in the book Creative Spirituality: The Way of the Artist written by Robert Wuthnow. Kim is director of graduate music studies and professor of piano and music history at Long Island University LIU Post.  Specializations = Olivier Messiaen = Kim is recognized as one of the leading specialists on the music of the French composer Olivier Messiaen. Among Kim's most notable achievements is his seven CD recording series comprising the complete piano works of Messiaen, released on the Centaur Records label from 2001 to 2005. Included in the series are Messiaen's major compositions such as Catalogue d'oiseaux, Vingt regards sur l'enfant-J√©sus, and the two-piano work Visions de l'Amen recorded with his son, Matthew Kim, who was 15 years old at that time. Critics have noted Kim's interpretations with references to his scholarly perspectives, athletic and poetic pianism, and spiritual qualities. The pianist Yvonne Loriod, the late composer's wife and the foremost interpreter of his music, described Kim's performances as \\"perfect in every way ‚Äî technique, rhythm, color, sonority, emotion.\\" = Beethoven = Kim is currently in the midst of a multi-volume recording series of the complete cycle of Beethoven's Nine Symphonies in his original transcriptions for the piano. The first volume, the Ninth Symphony (in an arrangement for two pianos), was recorded with his son Matthew and released in 2008 by Centaur Records.  Victim of Fraud  In 2007, it was revealed that Kim was among the classical pianists victimized by the recording scandal of Joyce Hatto. It was discovered that Hatto's recording of Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'Enfant-J√©sus was in fact Kim's recording of the same released by Centaur Records in 2002. A 2009 documentary film produced by Susannah Price in the UK entitled The Great Piano Scam investigated the fraud scheme and its impact on the world of classical music and the artists who were victimized.

The term first appears with this meaning in the joint-reign of Valerian and Gallienus. L. Petronius Taurus Volusianus was the first recorded Protector appointed by Gallienus. Imperial Guards of Gallienus It is indeed the case that the use of the title protector in the sense of a 'bodyguard of a Great Man' long preceded the appointment of Volusianus. In addition, the title was not only bestowed by Emperors.Mihailov, citing E. Birley, mentions two examples of men with this title, one appointed by a Praetorian Prefect and the other by a senatorial legatus. . However, it does seem to be the case that Gallienus was the originator of the particular body of men, the Protectores Augusti Nostri, with which this page is concerned. It seems that, when it was first bestowed, this title signified an honour conferred on rather than a function carried out by the recipient. It seems to have been granted to officers who had distinguished themselves serving directly under Gallienus in his wars against barbarian invaders of the Balkan and German provinces and Italy and would-be usurpers in those regions such as Ingenuus and were marked out for accelerated promotion under his patronage. No doubt its utility as an instrument for adding lustre to newly equestrianised military career structure soon became apparent. The first recipients were Tribunes of the Praetorian Cohorts - such as Volusianus - and equestrian commanders of legions such as Publius Aelius Aelianus. So far as is known it was never bestowed on any officer of senatorial rank - senators were effectively excluded from service in the army soon after the first protectores appeared. Towards the end of Gallienus's reign centurions too were given this title. By this time it was used exclusively to distinguish officers who had served in units associated with Gallienus's Imperial Field Army, the comitatusSee M. Christol: 'La carri√®re de Traianus Mucianus et l'origine des protectores: Chiron 7, 1977, pp 393 ff. Collectively, therefore, the first Protectores might more properly defined as a collegio (i.e. a guild) rather than a military unit serving a specific military purpose. There is contemporary reference to a Princeps Protectorum, but it is likely that this officer's functions related to ceremonial than to leadership in battle.One of the first known princeps protectorum was Traianus Mucianus - see Mihailov op.cit.. As far as can be determined that officer had no substantive office when he held the title and Christol (op.cit.) infers that his was a purely nominal posting while he waited for promotion to the rank of primus pilus. Holding commissioned rank in a unit attached to the comitatus seems to have been the sine qua non of admission to the body. These were men noticed by the Emperor likely to receive accelerated promotion in his service. The purpose of the Protectores at this time seems to have been two-fold: (i) to encourage a personal loyalty to the Augusti (particularly Gallienus: there is no reason to suppose that Valerian had any real interest in this innovation) among the most energetic and charismatic officers of the Imperial Field Army and thus combat the spirit of military dissent that was tearing the Empire apart at this time; (ii) to promote ambition among the officer cadres of provincial garrisons - which would, of course, serve the same purpose. After Gallienus After the death of Gallienus the Protectores seem to have evolved into a military unit. It was as commander of this body that the future Emperor Diocletian made his successful bid for the purple in 284 AD, challenging the Praetorian Prefect Aper whose power-base was the Praetorian Guard. However, membership of the corps still seems to have continued to be reserved for young soldiers marked out for rapid promotion. Constantine I was probably a member at the court of Galerius and Ammianus Marcellinus got his first step on the ladder of promotion in this capacity. Thus by that time day it had acquired some of the characteristics of an Imperial staff college.

They are evergreen, terrestrial plants which grow in clumps and have thin roots, leafy stems, pleated leaves and widely-opening flowers with thin, spreading sepals and petals. They are widely distributed in the tropics. Description Orchids in the genus Corymborkis are terrestrial, evergreen herbs which often grow in clumps and have short rhizomes and thin, wiry stems. One or more thin, unbranched stems arise from the same rhizome and have many papery, pleated, egg-shaped to elliptic leaves near their top half. A branching flowering stem develops from the upper leaf axils and carry crowded, widely-opening flowers. The flowers are greenish white and usually have thin, spreading sepals and petals which are similar to each other, with the petals slightly wider than the sepals. The labellum is about as long as the sepals, closely surrounds the column and has a tube-like base and two longitudinal ridges. Taxonomy and naming The genus Corymborkis was first formally described in 1809 by Louis- Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars and the description was published in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© philomathique de Paris. The name Corymborkis is derived from the Ancient Greek words korymbos meaning \\"bunch of flowers or fruit\\" and orchis meaning \\"testicle\\" or \\"orchid\\", referring to the bunched flowers of these orchids. Distribution and habitat Orchids in this genus are found in tropical Africa, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia, including on Christmas Island. They usually grow in moist, shady places in rainforest.

Biography McGaha was born in the small town of Cosby in eastern TennesseeMcGaha's Medal of Honor citation incorrectly records his place of birth and enlistment as \\"Crosby\\", Tennessee. to Laura McGaha. His family had a long history of service in the United States military. In October 1937, at age 23, he traveled to Asheville, North Carolina, hoping to enlist in the United States Navy. The navy recruiter, not needing any more enlistees, turned him away, so McGaha left for Knoxville and joined the United States Army instead. In 1941, McGaha was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, with Company G of the 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. He was there when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941, precipitating the United States' entrance into World War II. McGaha fought in the Guadalcanal Campaign and the northern Solomons before participating in the campaign to recapture the Philippines from Japanese control. On February 7, 1945, he was serving as a master sergeant during the Battle of Luzon. On that day, near Lupao, Luzon, he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire in order to aid wounded soldiers, led his platoon after the platoon leader was wounded, and deliberately drew Japanese fire onto himself so that others could escape to safety. For these actions, he was nominated for the Medal of Honor and given a battlefield commission to second lieutenant. McGaha was then discharged from the Army, but soon re-enlisted as a master sergeant and was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia. His nomination for the Medal of Honor was approved a year after the battle, on April 2, 1946. During a ceremony at the White House on March 27, 1946, President Harry S. Truman formally presented McGaha and another man, Navy Commander Richard O'Kane, with Medals of Honor. In December 1949, McGaha married Jeanette Large. McGaha again became a commissioned officer and reached the rank of major before retiring from the army. A full list of his decorations includes the Medal of Honor, four Purple Hearts, the Asiatic- Pacific Theater Ribbon with four Bronze Battle Stars, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with star, American Service Ribbon with star, Combat Infantryman Badge, Good Conduct Medal, and Master Paratrooper Wings and Star. McGaha died at age 70, after being stabbed forty times in an apparent robbery attempt, and was buried in Union Cemetery, Newport, Tennessee.

Tom Gottlieb reprised his role as Cookie Masterson, who was the announcer. The show lasted six episodes. Format Three contestants competed for the first three rounds, with only two going on to the final \\"Jack Attack\\" round. =Round One= In Round One, Stevens asked a series of questions, usually worth $1,000, although some opening questions were asked for lower amounts. Most questions were multiple choice (like the computer game), but some were simply open-ended questions with no choices. The player who signaled in and got the question correct won the money. (Unlike the computer game, an incorrect answer to a question did not lose money except for the \\"DisOrDat\\" and the \\"Jack Attack\\" rounds as described below.) After up to three questions were played, round one ended with a mini-round called \\"DisOrDat\\", which had a similar format to the computer game. Stevens gave the players a clue and the contestants had to choose one of the two possible answers or occasionally both. Correct answers were still worth $1,000. If any player gave an incorrect answer, the others could not steal; also, in the DisOrDat, a player giving a wrong answer had $1,000 taken away. =Round Two= Round Two was the same as Round One, but with dollar values doubled. Round Two ended with a feature called \\"The $2,000,000 Question\\". The question's value would start at $2,000,000 and decreased rapidly over time, starting from the moment Stevens began to read. While he was doing so, a lengthy distraction would occur, such as Stevens being attacked by ninjas or setting the question card on fire. During this time, the value continued to decrease; it would typically be under $200 when he finally finished reading the question. Whoever eventually answered the question correctly won the remaining money. =Round Three= Round three featured questions worth $3,000 apiece. Always popping up in this round was a question worth $3,000 under the category of \\"Things That Sound Dirty but Aren't.\\" For the final question of the round, worth $5,000, the players on either end of the row put up an opaque partition between themselves and the center player. Then all three contestants were asked a math question involving several elements of pop culture and fact, performing the operations in the order they appeared in the question: for instance, the unit number on M*A*S*H added to the number of digits in a U.S. Social Security number, minus the number of Beatles on the cover of The White Album, and the result divided by the number represented by a roll of \\"snake eyes\\"; the answer would be (4077 + 9 - 0) / 2 = 2043. They had 30 seconds to solve the problem using a dry- erase board and marker; during their thinking time, they would be distracted by such things as a crying baby, a mariachi band, and children poorly playing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star on violins. At the end of the round, the partitions were removed, and the correct answer was revealed by Stevens. The players then revealed their answers, usually in high-to-low score order. Any player answering correctly earned $5,000. At the end of this question, the two higher scorers moved onto the \\"Jack Attack\\". In an event of a tie for second place, one more \\"Sudden Death\\"-style question is read to the tied players. The first to signal in is the only one to give a response. If they answer correctly, they move on; if they fail, their opponent will move on. The eliminated player received a consolation prize; this player would usually would be seen on camera disappearing via a CGI effect (often exploding in a cloud of flames). =Jack Attack (Round Four)= Round Four was called the Jack Attack. It was played between the two remaining contestants. Stevens' head would pop up on the screen as both a comical sight and a possible distraction. The players were given a category and a series of clues. A series of answers then flew onto the screen. When an answer that fit both the category and the clue appeared on the screen, the players would buzz in and call out the answer. Correct answers were worth $5,000, but every incorrect answer given deducted $5,000 from the player's score. After six questions, the player with the higher score won the game and kept their money, while the other player received a consolation prize.

US distribution In the United States, the manufacture and/or distribution of Discos Fuentes releases was eventually handled by Miami Records, a Miami, Florida-based label specializing in Latin American music. Formed in 1950 by Colombian immigrant, Carlos Diaz-Granados, Sr., Miami Records also managed the manufacture and/or distribution of Latin music for other South American labels as well as for such American labels as Columbia Records.

They have thin, wiry stems with two or more tough, pleated leaves with a flowering spike at the top of the stem, bearing crowded flowers. Species in this genus are distributed across the warmer parts of both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Description Orchids in the genus Tropidia are evergreen, terrestrial, sometimes mycotrophic herbs which form small clumps. They have thin, wiry stems, sometimes with a few branches. The stems have two or more thin, tough, pleated, lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves. Crowded white, greenish or brown, sometimes resupinate flowers are arranged on the top of the stem and have the sepals and petals free from each other, or with the lateral sepals joined and surrounding the base of the labellum. The labellum is not lobed but has a pouch or spur at its base. Taxonomy and naming The genus Tropidia was first formally described in 1833 by John Lindley and the description was published in Edwards's Botanical Register. The name Tropidia is derived from the Ancient Greek word tropidos meaning \\"keel\\", referring to the boat-shaped labellum of some species in this genus. Distribution and habitat Species in the genus Tropidium grow in deep shade in evergreen monsoon forests and are native to China, Japan, the Indian Subcontinent, Indonesia, Indochina, Philippines, New Guinea, Australia, Latin America (from Mexico to Ecuador), the West Indies, Florida, and some Pacific Islands including the Solomons, Fiji, New Caledonia, the Gal√°pagos and Vanuatu.

Fischer‚Äôs practice includes sculpture, installation and photography. Education and early career Born to two doctors as the second of two children in 1973,Calvin Tomkins (October 19, 2009). ‚ÄúThe Imperfectionist: Urs Fischer's inspired sloppiness‚Äù. The New Yorker. Fischer began his career in Switzerland where he studied photography at the Schule f√ºr Gestaltung, Zurich.Urs Fischer, Untitled (Lamp/Bear) (2005-2006) Christie's, New York. After the basic, first-year course in art and design, he enrolled in the school's photography department, and supported himself by working as a bouncer at Zurich night clubs and house parties. Fischer moved to Amsterdam in 1993, at the age of nineteen, and had his first solo show at a gallery in Zurich in 1996. He later lived in London, Los Angeles, and Berlin before moving to New York. In Berlin and New York, he shared studios with fellow artist Rudolf Stingel. Work Baked Master's Basket, 1999/2005, Berlin, Nationalgalerie Fischer works across sculpture, photography, drawing, painting and publishing. The artist employs a variety of materials and processes in his work, resulting in an oeuvre that ‚Äúresists easy classification‚Äù. His subversive approach to art is often considered to be influenced by anti-art movements like Neo-Dada, Lost Art, or the Situationist International.Urs Fischer: Skinny Sunrise. Exhibition catalog. Kunsthalle Wien 2002. Since Fischer began showing his work in Europe in the mid-1990s, he has produced an enormous number of objects, drawings, collages, and room-size installations. Fischer has been described by the arts and culture magazine Vault as ‚Äúinternationally celebrated‚Äù and one of the most significant contemporary artists working today. =Individual pieces= In Untitled (Bread House) (2004-2005), Fischer constructed a Swiss style chalet out of loaves of bread. His Bad Timing, Lamb Chop! (2004-2005), displays a giant wooden chair (actually cast aluminium) intersecting a half-empty packet of cigarettes dramatically increased in scale. Between 2005 and 2006, he created Untitled (Lamp/Bear), an edition of three 23-foot-tall, 20-ton, bronze bears (two are yellow, the third is blue) intersected with generic functional lamps that appear to spring out of their heads; in 2011, one of the pieces was displayed for five months at Seagram Building's plaza before being auctioned at Christie's and is currently displayed at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar.Sarah Douglas Christie's Bullish on Urs Fischer's Bear New York Observer.

Urs Fischer Interview: Natural Order. artflyernet. Accessed 25 January 2017. For his 2007 show at Gavin Brown's Enterprise in New York, Fischer excavated the gallery's main room, bringing in contractors to dig an eight-foot hole where the floor had been, and calling the result You. The work was described by art critic Jerry Saltz as ‚Äúexperimentally rich, buzzing with energy and entropy, crammed with chaos and contradiction.‚Äù In Death of a Moment (2007), two entire walls are equipped with floor-to-ceiling mirrors and set in motion by a hydraulic system, to create the surreal effect of a room in flux, morphing in shape and size.Urs Fischer: 'Douglas Sirk', Sadie Coles HQ, London, 06/10‚Äî11/12/2010 The Modern Institute, Glasgow. In 2010, Fischer released a publication with fellow artist Darren Bader, titled The Bearded Island / The Artists Lament. The publication was a parallel project to the 2009 group exhibition ‚ÄúRemembering Henry‚Äôs Show‚Äù at the Brant Foundation in Greenwich, Connecticut. The text is a close examination of the fear and obsessions that pervade the life of an artist, set against a series of images. In 2018, he conceived PLAY, a room-size exhibit combining choreography and sculpture in which audience members can interact with office chairs equipped with motion sensors and motors that move on their own and react to the actions of participants in the gallery. Fischer‚Äôs wax sculptures have become iconic of the artist‚Äôs practice. Fischer began making wax sculptures in the early 2000s, resulting in anonymous and crudely cut female forms. Today, his wax sculptures are refined portraits of significant art world figures that are lit like candles and melted over the duration of an exhibition. The wax works are almost exclusively sculptural portraits of human subjects, and the process of melting lends itself to contemplation of existentialism and the ultimate meaning of art and it‚Äôs legacy. In 2011, Fischer created a to-scale wax reproduction of The Rape of the Sabine Women by Flemish-Italian sculptor Giambologna for the Venice Biennale. The sculpture was produced at the Swiss foundry, The Kunstgiesserei. Giambologna's original work in the Piazza della Signoria was digitzed using an optical scanner, and the image was used to create a 3D model in polyurethane foam. A negative was made from the foam model, and filled with wax that was pigmented to imitate the effect of marble. A wick system was developed to allow the work, Untitled 2011, to melt like a candle for the duration of the Biennale. The exhibition included another wax sculpture of Fischer‚Äôs friend and fellow artist Rudolf Stringel and a wax creation of Fischer‚Äôs own office chair. The work was described as a highlight of the Venice Biennale by Vault magazine. Francesco 2017 is a four-metre tall wax sculpture of the Italian curator Francesco Bonami, a close personal friend of the artist. The National Gallery of Australia acquired Francesco in 2018, the first acquisition under the leadership of new Director Nick Mitzevich. It is the first work of Fischer‚Äôs to be accessioned into a collection in the southern hemisphere. Urs Fischer's Francesco 2017 on display at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, April 2019. Francesco 2017 depicts Bonami atop an open refrigerator stacked with fruit and vegetables. The refrigerator acts as a plinth, a satire of sculpture‚Äôs elevation of important men on marble plinths. The figure stares at his smartphone, in a position ‚Äúemblematic of our era‚Äù. The melting wax and fruit and vegetables in the fridge are a reference to memento mori of seventeenth-century Dutch painting, where motifs such as food, candles, hourglasses and skulls are utilised as a reminder of mortality. The artist sets no strict parameters for the burning of the sculpture. Wicks are inserted at various locations on the work; all the wicks can be lit at once to accelerate the process or the life of the work can be extended by limiting the number of wicks lit at once. The work can be lit continuously or sporadically. Once the figure has melted completely, the remains will be returned to the Swiss foundry where it was made to be recast and returned to the museum for the next installation. Mitzevich described the acquisition to The Australian as ‚Äú[embodying] what this generation of art is about‚Äù. In another interview with the Canberra Times, Mitzevich says that the sculpture demonstrates that contemporary art ‚Äúis not static, it is alive and always changing, reflecting the world in which we live‚Äù. =Kiito-San= Fischer has his own publishing imprint, Kiito-San, whose books are distributed by DAPhttp://www.artbook.com/kiito-san.html and Buchhandlung Walther K√∂nig. The imprint has published exhibition catalogues by Fischer as well as books on the work of Spencer Sweeney, Peter Regli, and Darren Bader. In 2015 Kiito-San released a cookbook called Cooking for Artists, written by Mina Stone, who cooks lunch at Fischer's studio. Fischer's current studio occupies a large warehouse in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, near the waterfront. Exhibitions Fischer‚Äôs first large-scale solo exhibition was Kir Royal in 2004 at the Kunsthaus Zurich in 2004. Fischer‚Äôs first solo exhibition in an American museum was ‚ÄòUrs Fischer: Marguerite de Ponty, exhibited across three floors of the New Museum in 2009. The exhibition, curated by the artist, featured ‚Äúimmersive installations and hallucinatory environments.\\" Despite the expansive survey of Fischer‚Äôs sculptural and installation works, the exhibition was described as ‚Äúelegant and breathtakingly spare‚Äù, and was well received by critics. In 2012, the Palazzo Grassi exhibited a retrospective of Fischer‚Äôs work, conceived by the artist and curator Caroline Bourgeois. The exhibition was a restaging of the artist‚Äôs London studio, and included a survey of models, sketches, notes, furnishings and works of art. Fischer was the first living artist to receive a monographic exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi. In 2013, MOCA undertook a huge retrospective of Fischer‚Äôs work across its two locations, The Geffen Contemporary and MOCA Grand Avenue. This included curation of Fischer‚Äôs own works as well as physical interventions in the space such as You 2007, where the artist has cut huge holes out of the museum wall, and an interactive piece Yes 2013 that consisted of many ‚Äòsculptural experiments‚Äô in clay created by visitors to the exhibition. Michelle Kuo, writing for Artforum, described the interventions as a challenge to the ‚Äústaid and uniform‚Äù methods of contemporary curation. Coverage in the Los Angeles times was more critical, commenting that Fischer‚Äôs work was largely derivative of artists that came before, such as Robert Gober, Marcel Duchamp and Bruce Nauman; and that the art world satire felt hollow considering that the vast majority of works were loaned from private galleries and collections. Fischer's installations and sculptures have been exhibited in some group exhibitions and biennales worldwide, including Manifesta 3 and the Venice Biennale in 2003, 2007, and 2011.

Its larvae (caterpillars) are pests of certain stored foods, namely milled plant products. It is the type species of the genus Pyralis, and by extension of its entire tribe (Pyralini), subfamily (Pyralinae) and family. Its synanthropic habits were noted even by 18th- and 19th-century naturalists, who described it using terms like domesticalis (\\"of home and hearth\\"), fraterna (\\"as close as a brother\\"), or the currently-valid farinalis (\\"of the flour\\").See references in Savela (2009) At rest, adult moths (imagines) typically hold the tip of their abdomen at 90¬∞ to their body. Their upperwings are fairly colourful by moth standards, and have a wingspan of 18‚Äì30 mm. Adults fly from June to August.Kimber (2010) Adults do not live long after mating and eggs hatch quickly, which leads this moth to have a quick life cycle and be able to produce multiple generations within a single year. In Great Britain and some other locations - particularly outside its natural range - it is mostly restricted to anthropogenic habitats of stored grain, e.g. barns and warehouses. However, it has been found in almond orchards among plant detritus and poultry farms among chicken manure. P. farinalis is a species that is well adapted to living among humans and the urbanization that comes along with them. Though considered a pest to most since it can decimate grain storages, humans have found a use for this pesky moth. In Chinese culture it is the main ingredient of \\"insect tea.\\" This drink is popular enough that scientists have been studying the moth's optimum growth conditions so they can possibly cultivate it for commercial use. Geographic range Pyralis farinalis has been described as a \\"cosmopolitan\\" species, which means its range extends across most of the world. It is found all across the United States, but is mostly found along the eastern coast. This moth is most commonly seen in the Northeastern region. It is also found in Great Britain in the Falkland Islands and in China. Habitat P. farinalis is typically found in silos or other grain storage buildings where the grain is stored poorly and moisture is able to infiltrate the grain supply. Places where refuse vegetable matter is able to accumulate are more likely to house P. farinalis than grain storage buildings where the environment is clean and dry. P. farinalis prefers to live in detritus and has been found in non-urban areas in almond orchards. Meal moths can live in various habitats of damp, moist plant debris, but also even in poultry manure. Food resources=Caterpillar= As caterpillars, P. farinalis subsists mostly on cereals, but will also feed upon other types of grain and vegetables, such as potatoes. The meal moth's larvae are also interesting because they feed on all parts of the grain plant and do not seem to have any preference for one part of another. The larvae are equally likely to eat a cereal plant's seed, bran, husk, or straw. Life history Originally thought to be biennial species, it has been found that P. farinalis typically completes its entire life cycle in the course of eight weeks, and is capable of producing four generations within a year. Fast life cycles in these moths allow them to reproduce and grow their populations rapidly. =Life cycle=Egg The eggs of P. farinalis are ellipsoid in shape and very wrinkled with creases running lengthwise along the egg. These wrinkles form a reticulated pattern on the surface of the egg. Eggs are usually laid between two and five days after copulation and hatch after a nine-day incubation period. Healthy females produce an average of 235 eggs in her lifetime. Caterpillar The larvae of P. farinalis spend most of their time out of sight of predators and humans. They live in tunnels of silk and meal particles which keep them safe from predators and they come to the openings of these tunnels to feed. Pupae Once fully grown, the caterpillars leave their tubes and spin a cocoon where they will develop into an adult. After 6‚Äì8 weeks the pupae will emerge as fully developed adults. Adult Adults are usually fully developed between 60‚Äì65 days after oviposition. Virgin adults would then mate as quickly as possible. Once mated, males and females would usually only live for nine to ten more days. Enemies= Parasites = P. farinalis is parasitized by a number of species. These include: * Meteorus ictericus * Tetrasticus * Lespidea tarsalis * Apantales carpatus * Goniozus columbianus * Metacoelus mansuetos * Melanophora roralis Mating=Female/male interactions=Pheromones An odd behavior that male meal moths exhibit is the attempt to mate with other species, such as Amyelois transitella. It is hypothesized that these two species share the sex pheromone (Z,Z)-11,13-hexa decadienal which female A. transitella use to attract males of their species. However, male P. farinalis are also attracted to this pheromone and will court and copulate with A. transitella females, but it is unlikely that offspring of these copulations would be viable. Interactions with humans=Pest of crop plants= Because of the meal moth's extensive appetite for cereals and grains, it is considered a pest by agriculturists. If grain is not stored properly, then a colony of meal moths can do considerable damage to the crop. =Agricultural use= One of the most surprising uses for P. farinalis is its use in producing \\"insect tea\\" in China. In China, the moth lives on the host plant of Litsea coreana and scientists have been studying optimum temperatures for which the moth is able to grow and develop best in the hopes of being able to cultivate the moths for insect tea.

Development In 1930 the French Navy issued a requirement for a light coastal patrol seaplane mainly for use in the French colonies. Gourdou- Leseurre built and designed a prototype GL-831 HY which was a modification of the companies earlier GL-830 HY with a smaller Hispano-Suiza radial engine. The GL-831 HY first flew on 23 December 1931. In 1933 the French Navy ordered 22 aircraft designated GL-832 HY, this had a less powerful engine than the prototype. The GL-832 HY was a metal construction low-wing monoplane with fabric covered wings and twin floats. The aircraft had a large wing to take the stresses of a catapult launch, the wings also folded to allow stowage on board a ship. Unusually the braced-horizontal tailplane was attached to the underside of the rear fuselage. Two open cockpits in tandem were provided for the two crew, each cockpit having a windscreen. The first production aircraft flew on 17 December 1934 and the last on 12 February 1936. Operational history The French Navy used the GL-832 HY on second-line cruisers like the Emile Bertin and Primauguet and on smaller colonial sloops. The smaller sloops did not have a catapult and the aircraft were lowered into the sea using a crane. The aircraft were still operational at the start of the Second World War and were not retired until 1941.

Educated at Temple University and at Yale University, Ormont was also a prolific playwright who produced more than fifty manuscripts for the stage, television, and films.http://libraries.adelphi.edu/special/findingaids/Ormont%20Literary%20Collection.html The Ormont Method The Group as an Agent of Change: The theoretical cornerstone of the Ormont Method of Group Psychotherapy and Leadership is that the Group is the Agent of Change. To the extent the group leader can effectively engage group members to interact directly and responsibly with each other in very specific ways, a transformative and generative power emerges in the group that is many, many times greater than any group leader could ever hope to engender through his or her direct intervention. How effective can group members really be? The capacity of the power of the group- To heal group members,to meet maturational needs,to deepen the capacity for rewarding human relationships,and to make rewarding and productive life commitments -is potentially limitless. Are Dr. Ormont's techniques useful only in therapy groups? Dr. Ormont's techniques are based on psychoanalytic and developmental theories and clinical experience. They were developed primarily for psychotherapeutic groups. These principals of group theory and group interaction continue to be developed and are being effectively applied in all settings where groups of people convene. They can enhance and increase personal and interpersonal meaning, satisfaction, communication, creativity, and productivity, and promote group cohesion. Where does the transformative and generative power of the group come from? Dr. Ormont has developed and refined skills and techniques with which group leaders may cultivate healthy channels of expression and interaction between and among group members. As these channels grow stronger, human relationship between and among group members becomes the cradle that nurtures unprecedented human growth. The creative power comes from the rich diversity of group members' own experience, personalities, perspectives, strengths, and talents. The Five Theoretical Pillars These five interrelated concepts represent the theory, structure, and processes that form the foundation for the Ormont method of group intervention. 1\\\\. The Observing Ego The observing ego is that part of the self that has no affects, engages in no actions, and makes no decisions. It functions in conflict-free states to merely witness what it sees. It is like a camera that records without judgment. It is never weighing any thought, gesture or action on the scale of right and wrong, sane or insane, good or bad. It is a psychic entity that is intact and separate from what is taking place before it. Dr. Ormont's concept of the observing ego extends familiar concepts in ego psychology and incorporates thinking from eastern philosophy. He has developed group leadership techniques to use the collective and individual observing egos within a group as a source of strength and potentiation for all group members. 2\\\\. The Insulation Barrier The insulation barrier is a psychic structure that supports and protects ego boundaries. A healthy insulation barrier allows a person to withstand toxic stimuli but to take in nutrient experiences. The individual with a healthy insulation barrier generally enjoys feelings of ease and wholeness within ego boundaries that are flexible and adaptive. The insulation barrier is a developmental concept that has roots in psychoanalytic theories of defense, and in humanistic psychology's respect for the self-directing capacities of human beings, as well as the developmental need for genuine I-Thou encounters. Dr. Ormont's theory and methodology enables the group leader to empower group members to sustain a group environment in which interactions among and between members support the development of insulation barriers that maximize one's inherent capacity for ease, generosity and contentment, in all aspects of human relationship. 3\\\\. Generative Communication Progressive Emotional Interactive: Generative Communication is the verbalization of the feeling, thought, notion or idea in mature adult language. It has three qualities: it is progressive, emotional and interactive. Progressive refers to the irresistible forward movement of the group's maturation. Emotional refers to the affect laden aspects of human communication. Interactive refers to the dynamic energy that takes place between people as they meaningfully connect with each other. Generative Communication describes the entire spectrum of meaningful connection in the group's intrapersonal and interpersonal dynamic-from the most general to the most specific, the most personal to the most collective. It has the important characteristic that it is of the moment yet it carries the individual and group forward. Function: Generative communication is the dynamic that functions as the transformative power of the group. In E.M. Forster's words, \\"The important thing is to connect.\\" Generative communication is a construct that includes theoretical understanding, and provides specific techniques and interventions group leaders can use to facilitate healthful, generative connections in groups. Theoretical Underpinnings: The theory of generative communication is rooted in Dr. Ormont's own clinical work, and in an impulse in group therapy that is traceable to the salubrious effects of the spontaneous interactions physician Joseph Pratt noted in his tubercular treatment groups in the early 1900s. The impulse of interpersonal connection is present in some meaningful form in every branch of psychotherapy and theory of effective leadership. Current research in attachment theory underscores the pervasive and overarching impact of learned patterns of connection that contribute to modes of human behavior in all arenas of human life. 4\\\\. Immediacy Immediacy is the formulation that the avenue to change is an emotionally charged interpersonal engagement that takes on a new form. Immediacy is the forming of new connections, and of building new forms out of old ones. Dr. Ormont provides interventions and techniques that promote immediacy in conjunction with progressive emotional interactive communication. Immediacy is the medium in which the group-and each member of the group-can be the agent of change for all its members. 5\\\\. The Group as Maturational Agent Maturational agent refers to the capacity of the group to provide exchanges between and among members that facilitate their personal development and growth. The Ormont method focuses on interventions to resolve the group's resistance to engaging in needed nutrient exchanges. Through selective interventions the leader can empower the group as a whole to repair emotional damage, fill in the developmental voids, and foster the potential of each of its members. Techniques and Interventions The techniques and interventions that Dr. Ormont has developed all relate in one way or another to two stabilizing forces: The Group Contract and Bridging techniques. In addition, interventions and techniques to maintain the safety of the individual and the integrity of the group are given primary importance. The Group Contract The group contract provides an objective, unchanging structure that all group members can observe in relation to all other group members' behavior and feelings. All group members agree to follow the contract that Dr. Ormont has developed. They understand its purpose is to guide the group forward in their work together. They discover that they all deviate from the guide from time to time. The group members' resistance to following the agreed upon contract provides a solid basis on which both the leader and group members can explore and study the kinds of stumbling blocks that impede group members not only in the group process, but in their daily lives. Bridging Techniques Bridging refers to a set of interventions group leaders can use to form and strengthen emotional bonds and generative communication between group members. Dr. Ormont has developed specific techniques for building bridges among group members depending on the immediate objective. Immediate objectives include such things as support for an individual member, energizing the group, promoting full participation, building group cohesion, promoting generative communication between members, and building and maintaining safety in the group. Safety in a Group Broadly defined, safety in the group is established by helping group members differentiate between interactions or exchanges in the group that are constructive and nourishing, versus interactions that are unproductive, damaging, or destructive. Dr. Ormont's interventions are designed to work in concert to protect group members from exposure to toxic stimuli or noxious emotional interchanges within the group, while recognizing and supporting the personal strengths of group members.

Although not as well known as Italian, Irish, Russian or Jewish mafias, the Polish mob has a presence in many urban Polish American communities.  Prohibition-era  During Prohibition, many Polish- American criminal gangs took advantage of the opportunity to make money through the illegal sale of alcohol. In Chicago, Joseph Saltis and Jake Guzik allied themselves with Al Capone's Chicago Outfit. However, fighting Capone was the North Side Gang, which, while mostly Irish-American, had a large Polish presence as well, with Hymie Weiss (Wojciechowski) having Polish heritage. Fred Goetz was involved in carrying out the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In New Jersey, the organization led by Mickey Cusick, was the prominent boss of bootlegging in Southern Jersey. The infamous gangster Meyer Lansky, one of the leaders of the National Crime Syndicate and associate of Lucky Luciano, was actually a Polish Jew. Joseph Filkowski led a mostly Polish bootlegging ring in Cleveland, Ohio, along with gangster Joseph Stazek. In Pittsburgh, Paul Jarwarski was also a prominent figure, carrying out the first armored car robbery. In Buffalo, New York John \\"Korney\\" Kwiatkowski led a gang called the \\"Korney Gang\\" that was involved in multiple murders and robberies.They Call Me Kormey by Michael F. Rizzo Gangs The Philadelphia Polish Mob, known as the Kielbasa Posse, are a Polish American organized crime group operating from the Port Richmond area in Philadelphia. Named after the Polish word for sausage, the gang is made up of Polish immigrants living in Port Richmond, Kensington, North Philadelphia, Northeast Philly, Bucks County, and South Jersey, as well as second-generation Polish Americans. The gang moved into territory occupied by Irish, Russian, and Italian Mafia outfits, namely the trafficking and dealing of Ecstasy, and are said to have moved into bookmaking and loansharking operations as well. They would meet several times a week at a local Polish bar having a tough and fearsome reputation, they have been known to attack innocent people within their neighborhood. Many residents in the Port Richmond area of Philadelphia can tell of multiple accounts where these so-called gang members have caused trouble. They do not have a good relationship with the K&A; Gang who controls most of Northeast Philly, because the Northeast is predominantly Irish. According to local residents, they are not well known and the older Polish residents of the neighborhood choose to ignore the existence of the gang. In March 2006, the United States Attorney's Office in New York City published a press release covering the indictment of twenty-one members of the so-called Greenpoint Crew, an infamous Polish criminal organization operating out of the heavily Polish neighborhood of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Led by Ostap Kapelioujnyj and Krzysztof Sprysak, Kuzmazerilli the gang ran its operations of gunrunning, armed robbery, drug trafficking, extortion, car theft, credit card fraud and fencing (reportedly including a stolen 18th century Stradivarius violin) mostly in New York City, as well as having connections back in Poland and Eastern Europe.

Excavations have revealed there were six main construction phases on the site. The first phase was between 1359 and 1400 and produced a house platform surrounded by a moat. The building was razed to the ground on the orders of Henry VII after Sir Thomas Pilkington supported the House of York in the Wars of the Roses, particularly the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. On top of this, all of Sir Thomas' lands were confiscated. In 1540, antiquary John Leland described Bury Castle as \\"a ruin of a castle by the Parish Church in the town\\". In 1753, Thomas Percival drew plans of the visible foundations of the walls of Bury Castle, measuring by . The ruins were looted to provide building material for the town of Bury. In 1865, further foundations were discovered, this time of a keep or defensive tower by with walls thick.

Morton Shand, was an English journalist, architecture critic (an early proponent of modernism), wine and food writer, entrepreneur and pomologist. He is also the paternal grandfather of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales. Life Shand, the son of the writer and barrister Alexander Faulkner Shand and his wife Augusta Mary Coates, was born in Kensington, London. He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, as well as studying at the Sorbonne, Paris, and in Heidelberg, Germany.Alan Windsor, Letters from Peter Behrens to P. Morton Shand, 1932‚Äì1938, Architectural History, Vol. 37, (1994), pp. 165‚Äì187. Shand was married four times. His first marriage was to Edith Marguerite Harrington in April 1916, with whom he had a son, Bruce Shand, father to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. They divorced in 1920. Shand's second marriage was to Alys Fabre- Tonnerre, in 1920, with whom he had a daughter. They divorced in 1926. Shand's third marriage was to Georgette Th√©r√®se Edm√©e Avril, whom he married in 1926.The Windsor Knot They divorced in 1931, without having had any children. Shand's fourth marriage was to Sybil Mary Sissons (previously Mrs. Slee) in 1931, with whom he had one daughter named Elspeth. Elspeth married Geoffrey Howe, later Baron Howe of Aberavon, who was then a lawyer and later a politician. Elspeth became a life peer in her own right as Baroness Howe of Idlicote. Shand's step-daughter, Mary (Sybil's daughter from her first husband naval Commander John Ambrose Slee) married architect Sir James Stirling. Shand died on 30 April 1960 (age 72) in Lyon, France. The poet John Betjeman and the French wine expert Andr√© Simon wrote addenda to Shand's obituary in The Times. Career Shand studied history at King's College, Cambridge, gaining his MA in 1914. Shand served in the First World War with the Royal Fusiliers regiment,Results for British Army Service Records 1914‚Äì1920On his marriage certificate in 1916 he describes himself as a clerk at the War Office and immediately afterwards, due to his fluent French and German, he was appointed as superintendent of all German prisoners' camps in France. Already in 1914 he had translated from German to English Arthur Schnitzler's play Liebelei, under the title Playing with Love. Though his first major publications from that time were on food and wine, he began to also build a reputation as an architecture critic, working in particular for Architectural Review, where he had been influential in steering the journal's then proprietor and sometimes editor Hubert de Cronin Hastings in favour of modernism.Jonathan Glancey, \\"Townscape and the AR: Humane urbanism in the 20th century\\", Architectural Review, 7 June 2013. While living in Lyon, France, in the early 1920s, he was invited by the editor of the Architectural Association Journal to review the Exposition Internationale des Artes D√©coratifs in Paris of 1925. In reviewing the exposition, he coined the term \\"Swedish grace\\" to describe the Scandinavian design of the time, evident in the work of among others Gunnar Asplund, though by that time a new, modernist architecture and design was emerging, as evident at the exposition in the work of its prime mover Le Corbusier.Katherine E. Nelson, Raul Cabra, New Scandinavian Design (2004).See also Nordic Classicism Shand's first book on architecture, Modern Theatres and Cinemas was published in 1930 and featured many of those buildings he had encountered in Germany during the late 1920s, arguing that there the cinema had emerged as a separate design typology, not an adaptation of traditional theatre design. Shand was befriended by some of the leading figures in European modernist architecture, including Peter Behrens, Le Corbusier, head of the Bauhaus Walter Gropius, Alvar Aalto and Swiss historian-critic Sigfried Giedion, keeping correspondence with each of them. He also developed close links with architects back in the UK, encouraging their participation in the modernist debate. Shand translated from German to English Gropius's 1925 book Die neue Architektur und das Bauhaus, published in 1930 as The New Architecture and the Bauhaus.SERIES PP/29 Shand with furniture designer and entrepreneur Jack Pritchard helped with Gropius's emigration from Germany to the UK in 1934., note 34. Le Corbusier and Giedion had been prime movers in the foundation of the Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) in 1928, in the promotion of the cause of modernist architecture and town planning. Giedion was its first and only general secretary. There had been no British participants in the first CIAM conference in 1928. But in January 1929 Shand wrote to Gropius suggesting Howard Robinson, head of the Architectural Association school of architecture and Shand's own cousin, as the British CIAM representative. When this did not work out, Shand recommended Japan-born, Canada-educated architect Wells Coates. Shand, together with architects Coates, Maxwell Fry and F. R. S. Yorke were the founding members of the MARS Group (Modern Architectural Research Group), which operated from 1933 to 1937.The MARS Group / Designing Modern Britain ‚Äì Design Museum : ‚Äì Design/Designer Information The group came into existence at the prompting of Giedion, after Shand wrote to him.Eric Paul Mumford, The CIAM discourse on urbanism, 1928‚Äì1960 (2000), p. 91. Shand, Coates, Yorke and three other members of the Mars Group attended their first CIAM congress in 1933, which took place on board an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July that year. A series of articles under the title Scenario for a Human Drama, in Architectural Review of 1934‚Äì5, was Shand's attempt to document and place the contemporary architecture in Europe.Theme: Centenary, 1935‚Äì1951. (architecture) ‚Äì The Architectural Review  Encyclopedia.com In seven parts it set out ideas on the evolution of Continental modernism.Harry Francis Mallgrave, Modern Architectural Theory: A Historical Survey, 1673‚Äì1968 (2005), p. 314. Shand was sued for bankruptcy in March 1933, with the court case taking place in August that year.London Gazette, Applications for Discharge That same year, however, with Geoffrey Boumphrey, he founded a company Finmar to import Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's furniture into the UK,Kevin Davies, \\"Finmar and the Furniture of the Future: The Sale of Alvar Aalto‚Äôs Plywood Furniture in the UK, 1934‚Äì1939\\", Design History, 1998, 11 (2): 145‚Äì156. for the purposes of which he set up an exhibition of Aalto's furniture and experimental wood reliefs at the Fortnum & Mason department store in London.Alvar Aalto: Through the Eyes of Shigeru Ban In 1935 he visited Finland with Jack Pritchard and Graham Reid and saw Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium and the Artek furniture factory which made the furniture sold in the UK by Finmar. Jack Pritchard Chronology Shand retained a friendship with Aalto, and as Aalto spoke little English until the 1940s, they conversed and corresponded in German. Aalto would later tell his biographer, G√∂ran Schildt, that due to his military background and faultless German, Shand had acted as a British spy behind German lines during the war, though Shand himself never made such a claim elsewhere.G√∂ran Schildt, Alvar Aalto: His Life. Jyv√§skyl√§, Aalto Museum, 2007, pp.686-688. On Aalto being awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects Gold Medal in 1957, Shand wrote him to offer his congratulations, and Aalto wrote back saying of himself and Shand that \\"We are the last surviving soldiers of the Salvation Army\\". On his trip to the UK, Aalto visited Shand in Cambridge, where he spent his retirement. Despite his early enthusiasm for modernism in design and architecture, by the late 1950s he was far more critical towards the results of modern architecture, writing that: Shand demonstrated his knowledge of food and wine in articles and books published during the 1920s. He set out his viewpoint at the beginning of the 300-page A Book of Food (1927): \\"This is frankly a book of prejudices, for all food is a question of likes and dislikes. One may be tolerant about religion, politics, and a hundred and one other things, but not about the food that one eats.\\"The Montreal Gazette Works *A Book of French Wines, 1925. *A Book of Food, 1927. *A Book of Other Wines ‚Äì Than French, 1929. *Bacchus or Wine To- Day and To-Morrow, 1929.
