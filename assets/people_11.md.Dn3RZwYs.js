Romans erected a bridge (probably a wooden one as no trace of stone abutments remains) across the River Test, below which it widens into its estuary, and there are traces of the Roman road from Nursling to Stoney Cross. At Nhutscelle a Benedictine monastery was established in 686, the earliest Benedictine establishment in Wessex according to Bede. It became a major seat of learning, and at the end of the 7th century, Winfrith (subsequently Saint Boniface) studied here under the abbot Winberht, producing the first Latin grammar to be written in England. He left in 710 for Canterbury, returning briefly around 716 before going to Germany as a missionary. The Danes destroyed the monastery in 878 and it was never rebuilt; its exact site has not been identified, though the parish church is dedicated to St. Boniface. Thirty households lived in Hnutscilling, according to the Domesday Survey, belonging to the Bishop of Winchester. O. G. S. Crawford, the archeologist, lived in Nursling during World War II, and kept much rare material from the Ordnance Survey office in Southampton in his garage. This foresight saved much important historical material from destruction when the offices were burnt out in an air raid. The cricketer William Henry Harrison was born in Nursling. Present day Nursling Industrial Estate, adjacent to the M271, houses several major businesses, such as Tesco, Norbert Dentressangle and Meachers, and is ably served by transport links, the motorway giving easy access to the Southampton container terminal, as well as the motorway links to London and the Midlands.

Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates and is often the target of insults and general ridicule. After he is killed by a radiation leak during an ellipsis in the series' first episode \\"The End\\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated hologram, indicated by the 'H' symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft- light'; come the series VI episode \\"Legion\\" (1993), Rimmer's LightBee is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \\"Stoke Me a Clipper\\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by nanobots with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as the original hologram Rimmer in the miniseries Back to Earth (2009) onward. Doug Naylor confirmed in 2020 that the Rimmer from Back To Earth onwards is the original Rimmer having returned from his time being Ace Rimmer. Why he returned or what happened to the Nano version of Rimmer from series eight has not been revealed yet. The creators of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's surname comes from a snobby prefect with whom they attended school. They joke that only the boy's name was used, and not his personality because that would imply he had one.  Fictional history  = Television =  1980s  Resurrected as a 'soft-light' hologram, Rimmer was unable to touch or interact with his environment until the series VI episode \\"Legion\\" where he became a 'hard-light' hologram. Rimmer first appeared in Red Dwarfs first episode \\"The End\\" (1988), where he is characterised as second technician on board the mining ship Red Dwarf, ranking above Dave Lister (Craig Charles), the lowest ranked crew member on board the ship with whom he shares quarters, and below all four of the service robots. As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on vending machines that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \\"engineer's exam\\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and he reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from stasis, where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer Holly (Norman Lovett) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a hologram, having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board Red Dwarf is a creature called \\"Cat\\" (Danny John-Jules), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis. By the time of \\"Future Echoes\\" (1988), Rimmer claims to have taken the \\"astronavigation exam\\" without passing nine times, or \\"[t]en, if you count the time [he] had [his] spasm.\\" He also claims in this episode that his father had said, \\"Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut, and you can cope with anything,\\" right before \\"that unfortunate suicide business\\". In \\"Balance of Power\\" (1988), Holly reveals that reason Rimmer was brought back as a hologram was because, in Holly's judgment, Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane because the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, making Rimmer the crew member with which Lister had the most interaction; in Holly's judgment, the fact that their interactions were almost entirely antagonistic was irrelevant. Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski's (C P Grogan) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again. Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's. In \\"Confidence and Paranoia\\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a concussion. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer. In \\"Me¬≤\\" (1988), Rimmer is shown moving in with his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at night school, although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with Citizen Kane. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \\"gazpacho soup\\". Demonstrating intense, literal self-hatred, the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a faux pas where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \\"anybody could make a mistake like that.\\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \\"death\\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \\"gazpacho soup\\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances. Despite \\"Future Echoes\\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \\"Better Than Life\\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by John Abineri) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of malnutrition. Rimmer's father also stretched his sons on a traction machine to make them taller, causing Frank to be 6'5\\" by the time he was eleven. Rimmer disliked his parents enough to the point where he divorced them from himself when he was fourteen; Rimmer getting paid maintenance until employment age and access to the family dog every fourth weekend. According to \\"Thanks for the Memory\\" (1988), Rimmer did a maintenance course at Saturn Tech. Rimmer also claims that his sexual liaison with McGruder was the only point in his entire life he had made love. In \\"Queeg\\" (1988), Rimmer mentions how, after being burnt once by a person he considered his best friend, he had considered no-one in his life to be \\"true friends\\", and that friends were only friends when it suits them. He explains that when he was fifteen, he had a \\"friend\\", Porky Roebuck, to whom Rimmer believed that Porky's father having an affair with Rimmer's mother proved how close he and Porky were. Porky and Rimmer went on a Space Scouts survival course together, where Porky was the ringleader of a plan to eat Rimmer; Rimmer being tied to a stake and having barbecue sauce poured on him before he was almost cooked. Lister believes that Porky was \\"only\\" bullying Rimmer. \\"Parallel Universe\\" (1988) shows Holly's \\"Holly Hop Drive\\" trying to get to Earth within a few seconds. Instead, however, it lands the crew in a female-oriented parallel universe with another version of Red Dwarf; its crew including a female version of Rimmer called Arlene Rimmer (played by Suzanne Bertish). Regarding Rimmer as little more than a \\"discardable sex object\\", the female Rimmer sexually harasses and gropes Rimmer and tries to hypnotise him even after Rimmer shows no interest. In \\"Backwards\\" (1989), Rimmer facilitates a driving test for the mechanoid Kryten (Robert Llewellyn), where Kryten causes the Starbug 1 shuttle to fall into a time hole. The ship crash lands on Earth in a reality where time runs backwards, leaving Kryten, Rimmer and Holly (now played by Hattie Hayridge) stranded. Rimmer and Kryten start working as the novelty act \\"the Sensational Reverse Brothers\\" and begin to enjoy life in this new reality, but after three weeks, they are fired by a pub manager (Arthur Smith) for a fight that Rimmer and Kryten only become involved in later that night. Lister and the Cat come to rescue Rimmer, Kryten and Holly in another Starbug to get back to Red Dwarf. According to backstory in \\"Marooned\\" (1989), Rimmer did not lose his virginity to McGruder, but to a girl Rimmer met at cadet school called Sandra in the back of his brother's car. However, when adapted in the novel Better Than Life (1990), it is revealed Rimmer was lying. In \\"Polymorph\\" (1989), Rimmer considers the relationship he had with his brothers to be \\"close\\". He mentions that he was the butt of the \\"occasional\\" practical joke growing up. Despite varying from apple pie beds and black eye telescopes to hiding a small land mine in Rimmer's sandpit, Rimmer believes that none of this was \\"sinister\\". Rimmer says that some considered his mother (played by Kalli Greenwood) to be cold and aloof, but himself believes that she had no time for fools. Rimmer believes this to be \\"tragic\\", because they would otherwise have got on \\"famously\\". In \\"Timeslides\\" (1989), Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a photographic slide with mutated developing fluid, and he tells his seventeen-year-old self (played by Emile Charles) how to gain a successful multi-billion-pound business empire with fifty-eight houses by inventing the \\"tension sheet\\" so that he won't join the Space Corps and get trapped on Red Dwarf in deep space. By becoming the inventor of the tension sheet and never joining the Space Corps, Lister's entire timeline is altered, causing Kryten to never be rescued and the Cat race to no longer exist. Rimmer is left on his own with Holly and tries going back further in time to his eight-year-old self's (played by Simon Gaffney) days in boarding school so that he invents the tension sheet. Rimmer unwittingly sets things how they were before by causing the original inventor of the tension sheet‚ÄîThickie Holden (Stephen McKintosh), who is in the same dormroom as Rimmer and overhears Rimmer speaking to his younger self‚Äîto become the one who patents the tension sheet, but for reasons unclear to both Holly and Rimmer, Rimmer somehow changes his past so that he is alive back on Red Dwarf. His happiness is short-lived, however, as he dies within minutes anyway after hitting a box containing explosives. Rimmer is seen in the next episode, \\"The Last Day\\" (1989), once again as a hologram. According to his backstory, Rimmer's parents were \\"Seventh-day Advent Hoppists\\" and believed that every Sunday should be spent hopping, because their version of the Bible had a misprint in 1 Corinthians 13 and they had interpreted this passage literally. He mentions that the first time he was French kissed was from his Uncle Frank. He had come into the wrong room and thought Rimmer was his mum.  1990s  According to Lister in \\"Justice\\" (1991), before the nuclear accident that killed the crew of Red Dwarf, Rimmer was in charge of \\"Z Shift\\", and it occupied his every waking moment. Lister said that Z Shift's most vital responsibility was making sure the vending machines didn't run out of fun size Crunchie bars. In \\"Dimension Jump\\" (1991), an alternate Arnold Rimmer, whose friends call him \\"Ace\\", is shown as a successful and heroic test pilot in the Space Corps and commander who crosses dimensions to meet another Rimmer‚Äîthe hologrammatic Rimmer living on Red Dwarf. Ace's interdimensional ship collides with the Starbug shuttle, causing it to crash land on an ocean planet. With Lister's help, Ace repairs Starbugs starboard engine. After returning to Red Dwarf, Ace decides he can't stay, as he couldn't bear to be near the weaselly Rimmer of this universe. Ace can't return home but decides to explore other realities with \\"a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet.\\" Ace explains that the diverging point in their lives where Ace gets his big break and Rimmer doesn't is that at the age of seven, Ace went down a year in his class while Rimmer stayed up. Being kept down a year was according to Ace what changed him and made him fight back. According to \\"Meltdown\\" (1991), Rimmer's only physical presence is a small \\"light-bee\\"; a piece of hardware which buzzes around and projects his holographic image. This has been contradicted on a few occasions by his ability to move completely through solid objects such as walls or by the ability of solid objects or living characters to pass completely through Rimmer. In \\"Demons and Angels\\" (1992), Red Dwarf is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" version of Red Dwarf, complete with their own versions of Rimmer (both played by Barrie). Before the lifespans of both versions of Red Dwarf expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both Red Dwarfs and restore the original Red Dwarf by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The \\"high\\" version of Rimmer has his light-bee crushed by Lister when Lister's \\"low\\" self controls Lister into doing this by remote control, while the \\"low\\" version disappears with his version of Red Dwarf. In \\"Back to Reality\\" (1992), ink from a \\"despair squid\\" causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider \\"quintessential to [their] self-esteem\\". In the hallucination, Rimmer believes he is a vagrant with a coat smelling of yak's urine called Billy Doyle, with Lister being his more important half-brother, a totalitarian fascist mass murderer called Sebastian. Kryten also explains that because \\"Billy\\" has the same upbringing growing up with \\"Sebastian\\", Rimmer couldn't blame his own shortcomings on Rimmer's parents. The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second. In \\"Psirens\\" (1993), Kryten explains that Red Dwarf was \\"stolen\\", with the crew now based inside Starbug chasing after Red Dwarf to recover it. In \\"Legion\\" (1993), Rimmer encounters a being known as Legion (Nigel Williams), who upgrades Rimmer's projection unit from \\"soft light\\" to \\"hard light\\", giving him a physical form and the ability to interact directly with the world, in addition to making him virtually indestructible. In \\"Emohawk: Polymorph II\\" (1993), an emotion-leeching \\"emohawk\\" attacks Starbug and consumes Rimmer's bitterness, turning him into his \\"Ace Rimmer\\" persona. The emohawk is captured, and Lister freezes it with liquid dillinium. The crew plan to extract the emohawk's DNA strands and re- inject Rimmer with them to return his emotions to normal, but the Cat clumsily freezes everyone else before this can be done. In \\"Rimmerworld\\" (1993), Rimmer steals an escape pod locked on course with the nearest habitable planet. Because of the time dilation caused by the pod going through a wormhole, it takes six hundred years from Rimmer's perspective for Starbug to catch up with him, even though it's only moments from the point of view of Starbug. In the meantime, using cloning equipment inside the pod, Rimmer uses his DNA to create a society of thousands of Arnold Rimmers (all played by Barrie), who backstab Rimmer and imprison him before Lister, the Cat and Kryten rescue him centuries later. In \\"Out of Time\\" (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of Red Dwarf has been lost. In the episode, a Starbug from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten's future selves intending to copy some components from the present Starbugs time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the Habsburgs, the Borgias, Louis XVI, Adolf Hitler and Hermann G√∂ring. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future Starbug fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing Starbug up. In the following episode, \\"Tikka to Ride\\" (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future Starbug destroying the Starbug of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of Starbug in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered. In \\"Stoke Me a Clipper\\" (1997), Rimmer is approached by a dying Ace Rimmer (played by Barrie), who is not the Ace Rimmer which Rimmer had met previously, nor an immediate replacement but a distant successor and a hard light hologram with a damaged light-bee. Ace asks Rimmer to become a defender of the multiverse upon Ace's death. Although initially hesitant, Arnold finds himself rising to the challenge and leaves to start his new life. Lister, for a time, desperately misses him, and it takes a therapeutic song by a simulation of Rimmer (played by Barrie), shown in \\"Blue\\" (1997), to remind him what a horrible presence he could be. When Red Dwarf is restored by Kryten's nanobots at the end of the episode \\"Nanarchy\\" (1997), the entire crew is restored to life as well by a new set of nanobots created by Holly (again played by Norman Lovett) after Kryten's had gone missing, including Rimmer, as shown in Back in the Red (1999). Because he is resurrected as he was at the time of the accident, he lacks any of the growth that the \\"other\\" Rimmer has gone through since the series began, reverting him back to his original persona. In Back in the Red, Lister, Rimmer, Kryten, Cat and Kochanski (now played by Chlo√´ Annett) are sentenced to two years in the ship's brig for misuse of confidential information. In \\"Cassandra\\" (1999), the five of them get signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries after Holly lies to Lister that they're a singing troupe. In \\"Only the Good...\\" (1999), when a corrosive micro-organism is shown destroying Red Dwarf and everyone else evacuates to a mirror universe, Rimmer is trapped on the disintegrating ship. At the end of the episode, he encounters the Grim Reaper, who announces that Rimmer is dead and then tells him that they'll travel to the River Styx. Rimmer interrupts him, saying \\"Not today, matey!\\", knees him in the groin, says \\"Remember, only the good die young!\\", and flees.  2000s  In Red Dwarf: Back to Earth (2009), set nine years later, Red Dwarf is intact; the human race is apparently \\"virtually extinct\\" in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be the original hard light hologram version and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism and the Nano version of Rimmer is not explained. In this special, a female \\"despair squid\\", whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called Red Dwarf, and their dimension is \\"invalid\\". This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest \\"valid\\" reality. They confront the \\"Creator\\" of Red Dwarf (Richard O'Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they're hallucinating, and they wake up on board Red Dwarf. Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid.  2010s  In \\"Trojan\\" (2012), Rimmer discovers that one of his brothers, Howard (Mark Dexter), serves as a hologram on a Space Corps vessel. Rimmer lies to his brother, telling him that he is the captain of the abandoned space vessel Trojan. To his surprise, he finds that Howard is, like him, a vending machine repairman who became the superior officer on his ship. In Howard's case this followed an attack by Simulants. Howard is mortally wounded during a skirmish with the rogue Simulant who killed the crew, Sim. Crawford (Susan Earl), and Rimmer takes the opportunity to further lie to Howard on his deathbed about his lifestyle. According to Rimmer's backstory in \\"Lemons\\" (2012), Rimmer was given the middle name \\"Judas\\" because Judas, as characterised by the religious denomination that Rimmer's mother belonged to, the Church of Judas, embodied all of the traits Rimmer's mum wanted him to have. According to the Church of Judas, Jesus asked Judas, whom the Church believed was Jesus' twin brother, to swap places with him; Judas sacrificing himself and his reputation so that Jesus would appear to have been resurrected after showing up following the crucifixion of Judas. Rimmer learns of his true parentage from Lecturer Rimmer's recorded message. In a flashback depicted in \\"The Beginning\\" (2012), Rimmer is shown during his youth (played by Philip Labey) attending Io Polytechnic on Io, where one of his lecturers covering psychological profiling is the man he believes is his father, Lecturer Rimmer (now played by Simon Treves). After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding peer pressure. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board Blue Midget being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to Red Dwarf. It is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \\"Only the Good...\\". This is a combination of the respective memories of the hologram Rimmer, who later became Ace, and the resurrected Rimmer who faced Death in the Series VIII cliffhanger. However, attempts by Rimmer and Kryten to explain how he saved the ship at the end of that series are interrupted. In \\"Officer Rimmer\\" (2016), Rimmer is promoted to first lieutenant by a bio-printed copy of Captain Herring (Stephen Critchlow), when Rimmer saves Herring's ship the Nautilus by a fluke. He separates Red Dwarf by instigating a class system, and he sets up an officers' club featuring copies of himself (played by Barrie). Rimmer accidentally creates a monstrous amalgamation of Rimmers (also played by Barrie) that absorbs all the other Rimmers apart from the original. Rimmer resigns his rank, again becoming second technician, so he can leave the officers' corridor and get to safety. Lister, Cat and Kryten subsequently kill the monster. According to backstory in \\"Timewave\\" (2017), when Rimmer was six, his parents sent him to a different prep school, St Tremble's, so he could get his confidence back after being ridiculed every day and wedgied every night. According to Rimmer, games were not competitive there, and everyone won a \\"you're really special\\" trophy on sports day. He said that his sex life had been a \\"shambles\\" ever since one of Rimmer's brothers told him sex advice at school that the most important thing was the clitoris; Rimmer misheard it as \\"to spit on her wrist\\". In \\"Mechocracy\\" (2017), Kryten is elected president of the machines on Red Dwarf after running against Rimmer. In \\"Skipper\\" (2017), Rimmer, in search of a fresh start, decides to leave his universe using a quantum skipper that can skip to other universes where he feels less of a loser. In his first jump to a new universe it is the moment just before he causes the radiation leak but, for an unexplained reason, he is a hologram with his old letter 'H' on his forehead when this happened. After multiple attempts at finding a suitable universe, Rimmer arrives in a universe where he is alive, married and a navigation officer. However, upon discovering Lister is more successful and rich than he is, Rimmer returns to his original universe and breaks the quantum skipper, finding the pain of living in that universe \\"too much\\".  2020s  In The Promised Land (2020), Rimmer is disgusted by Lister's new hoarding habits, which have completely filled their former bunkroom to the brim with useless junk, so much so he refuses to go in there. After receiving a distress signal, Rimmer refuses to respond, deciding they're too old to be embarking on new adventures, ordering Kryten to erase the memory of receiving it from his memory. After being banished off Red Dwarf by the newly rebooted Holly (void of his old memories and personality), the crew eventually come across a ship possessing new and powerful technology, specifically related to holograms. Against Kryten's initial warnings, Rimmer is upgraded to 'Diamond Light', which grants his superpowers; however, Rimmer is quickly depleted of power and returns to his old form, now forced to be \\"plugged-in\\" to several power leads to stay online. After encountering three cat clerics, fleeing from their fellow felis sapiens under the command of warlord Rodon, who board the station. Rimmer alongside the crew are taken hostage briefly until Rodon, now at a distance, fires on the ship and allows the crew to escape. Crashing on a desert moon, Rimmer is forced to power down further as he's considered a nonessential resource, going into a black-and-white state. Whilst the crew are chased by Rodon's battlecruiser, Cat angrily insists Rimmer is a simple machine. Rimmer rejects this initially, quoting \\"I think, therefore, I am\\", however quickly loses confidence in this and enters an existential crisis. After the crew successfully escape into a sandstorm, Rimmer is comforted by Lister, who compares their dynamic to the sun and moon, producing moonlight even though the moon cannot initially generate it itself. By morning, the crew discover they are buried under the sand, however Rimmer formulates a plan to contact the rebooted Holly, which Kryten manages using an antenna extension from his hand. Rimmer tricks the rebooted Holly into downloading his former incarnation's memories, with the rebooted Holly believing he'll inherit his \\"wisdom\\" from all the years he was alive. After doing so, the restored Holly rescues the crew and they manage to return to Red Dwarf. However, the felis sapiens under Rodon are waiting for them, and Rodon orders their deaths by planting a bomb on Red Dwarf. Using the acquired Anubis Stone attained from the cat clerics, they once again transform Rimmer into his former \\"Diamond Light\\" incarnation, who uses his powers to dispose of the bomb off Red Dwarf and subsequently helps bring down Rodon's main battlecruiser in the following confrontation. Kryten, in a state of disrepair since the beginning of the story, is now on his last legs. After some convincing of a very hesitant \\"Diamond Light\\" Rimmer, he decides to use his Anubis Stone on Kryten to save his life, though stripping him of his superpowers. However, Rimmer is given a final boost when the felis sapiens, freed of Rodon's rule, decide to worship him, having their armada manifest into a large 'H'. = Novels = In Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers (1989), Rimmer is a First Technician. Rimmer first meets Lister while Red Dwarf is docked at Mimas, a moon of Saturn. There, Rimmer is under the persona of \\"Officer Christopher Todhunter\\" and dons a phony admiral uniform and false mustache. He encounters Lister, who has stolen the Mimas-equivalent of a taxi known as a 'Hopper' to earn money, and pays him to take him to the red-light district of the city where Rimmer plans to frequent a droid brothel, while lying and saying he intends to eat at a restaurant. Unlike in the television series, Rimmer's incompetence does not cause the radiation leak that kills the crew. Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer. In Better Than Life (1990), similar to the episode of the same name, the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive virtual reality video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's subconscious desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards. The two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. In Last Human (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night‚ÄîRimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion‚Äîleading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off Red Dwarf where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard Red Dwarf. She told him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the Mayflower, a large spaceship with terraformation capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the black box of Red Dwarf he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane. Following a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the Mayflower, separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. When given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self, Rimmer choked and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder. Imprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a gestalt manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back. In Backwards (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that Red Dwarf has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the Agonoids, a race of misanthropic robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect Starbug with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to Red Dwarf. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the American wild west, is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the Apocalypse Boys, the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending Starbug inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing Better Than Life but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. In the abridged audiobook, as read by author Rob Grant, the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard Starbug. Personality Rimmer's primary character traits include anal-retentiveness, over-adherence to protocol, cowardice, bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of self-loathing, which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others. As the highest ranking survivor aboard the ship (despite being a hologram), Rimmer often deludes himself into believing that he is in charge and that he has somehow been moulding \\"his\\" crew into an effective spacegoing unit, despite the fact that the others tend to take suggestions from Lister or Kryten in a crisis. Rimmer's poor repair work on the drive plate was responsible for the radiation leak that killed the crew, and Rimmer bore the guilt of this (although he also partly blamed Lister for the accident, as he was unable to help repair the drive plate due to being in stasis at the time). However, in \\"Justice\\" (1991), after Rimmer is sentenced for over 9000 years for the accident, Kryten successfully argues at his appeal that Rimmer's guilt is misplaced ‚Äì as a second technician (and one who \\"couldn't outwit a used teabag\\"), he could not possibly have been responsible for (and indeed would not have been trusted with) work that might endanger the crew if not performed correctly. Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment. In keeping with his defective personality, Rimmer continually objects to his own defense (despite its effectiveness) on the grounds that he believes he is being portrayed unfairly. Rimmer was finally able to live his fantasy of commanding an army in the episode \\"Meltdown\\" (1991), leading an army of \\"good\\" wax-droids against a much larger force of \\"evil\\" wax-droids. Although Rimmer ultimately succeeds in destroying the opposing army, his forces are completely wiped out when he uses most of them as a diversion and then has Kryten turn up the heating to melt all the droids. In addition to his fondness for militarism, elitism and Hammond organ music, Rimmer also enjoys Morris dancing and is an authority on 20th century telegraph poles, especially those observed while train spotting. Rimmer has also been attempting to learn Esperanto for eight years, but has failed miserably. In \\"Marooned\\" (1989), he reveals he used to play golf and hated people (like Lister) who abused the facilities. Many episodes of Red Dwarf focus on the conflict between Rimmer's ego and his neuroses. In \\"Confidence and Paranoia\\" (1988), Rimmer manages to trick Lister into generating a hologram duplicate in order to provide him with a companion; however, as a consequence of Rimmer's self-loathing, in the follow-up episode \\"Me¬≤\\" (1988), the two Rimmers are incapable of getting along, and their interaction becomes so bitter and hate-filled that the duplicate must be turned off. In \\"Terrorform\\" (1992), a \\"psi-moon\\" sculpted to reflect Rimmer's psychological make-up becomes a desolate, swampy hell-hole dominated by Rimmer's Self-Loathing, personified as a sadistic beast, with a metaphysical graveyard marking the \\"demise\\" of his various virtuous qualities. Despite his cowardice, and tendency to run from any kind of danger or fight, Rimmer is the member of the crew most willing to kill, preferably in the safest and most cowardly way possible, although, due to a mixture of cowardice, and the fact that for much of the series he cannot physically harm anyone, he seldom manages to. He attempts to coerce Lister to shoot a dangerous Simulant (Nicholas Ball) in the back (bemoaning the fact that said Simulant was currently awake), suggests shooting Kryten and Lister into space when they appeared on the ship in a timeline where they had been erased from history, suggests that he and Kryten eject Lister and Cat from Starbug when it is revealed that the ship lacks fuel to reach the nearest planet ‚Äì although this is also prompted by the discovery that the ship only had air for seven minutes and was ended when Rimmer learned that his projection unit only had enough power for four minutes ‚Äî and in a despair squid-induced hallucination of 21st century Earth, casually pushes a fellow hologram (Sophie Winkleman) into traffic after she repeatedly threatens to have him \\"erased\\" and claims that hologram-killing is \\"morally, ethically [...] fine\\". In \\"Officer Rimmer\\" (2016), Rimmer deems it better to sacrifice others for the safety of the crew. Rimmer's personality flaws are in fact almost completely a result of his hang- ups. An alternative version of Rimmer, Ace Rimmer, who was kept back a year in school, learned humility and inner strength, and grew up to become a charming and well liked Space Corps test pilot, interstellar hero, and sexual seducer. Surprisingly, however, Rimmer is still capable of nobility, honour and love. When Red Dwarf encounters a holoship with an all-hologram crew composed of the \\"best and brightest\\" in the episode \\"Holoship\\" (1991), Rimmer desperately wants to join. A female officer aboard the ship, Nirvanah Crane, played by Jane Horrocks, falls in love with him and sacrifices her place on the ship for Rimmer, only for Rimmer to do the same in return for her. This act of nobility surprises even Rimmer himself. In \\"Out of Time\\" (1993), Rimmer is disgusted by his corrupt future self to the point where he'd rather do battle with him than surrender (\\"Better dead than smeg!\\"), Rimmer later frantically risking his life to save the others after their future selves kill them. In \\"The Beginning\\" (2012), Rimmer is also able to formulate a plan to save the crew from the Simulant Generals. Rimmer has also showed the capacity to respect other viewpoints in conflict with his own; in \\"The Last Day\\" (1989), he tries to convince Lister that he should respect Kryten's right to believe in Silicon Heaven in spite of it conflicting with Lister's own beliefs, \\"Lemons\\" (2012) sees Rimmer eager to meet Jesus despite being an atheist, and in \\"Samsara\\" he presents a well-reasoned argument about the flaws in the concept of the Karma Drive. In \\"Polymorph\\" (1989), Rimmer leads Kryten and Cat in the hunt for the intruder and in \\"Bodyswap\\" (1989), he takes charge of the hunt for Red Dwarf's self-destruct mechanism. Once Rimmer is sapped of his anger by the Polymorph, he is a conciliatory pacifist wishing to promote peace between the creature and various members of the crew and keen to not hurt anybody's feelings during their discussions. In \\"Backwards\\" (1989), he revels in his success as a showbiz performer and extols the virtues of a world without war, famine, crime or death. In \\"Tikka to Ride\\" (1997), Rimmer protests against abusing the Time Drive and chastises Lister for doing so. Appearance Rimmer's status as a hologram in most episodes of Red Dwarf is shown by the 'H' on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from the Cat, such as \\"alphabet head\\" and \\"goalpost head\\". Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair relatively short, deciding that it makes him feel like more of a man. When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that \\"every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts\\" (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head). Rimmer's Space Corps uniform changes several times during the course of the show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special Back to Earth, Rimmer wears a blue suit similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the addition of a plain waist-high belt worn over the jacket and a quilted collar. From Series X onward, Rimmer sports a dark blue tunic; lacking the belt and light blue boots of the Back to Earth outfit. The 'H' on his forehead also changes from series to series: it starts as a grey colour and a blocky shape; in Series III, it becomes bright blue and reflective; in Series V, it's changed to a thinner and more stylised font. His 'H' also briefly changes to a reflective red colour set inside a circle when he temporarily joins the holoship SS Enlightenment. Casting Rimmer encounters his \\"female opposite\\" Arlene. Among the actors who auditioned for Rimmer were Norman Lovett (cast as Holly instead), David Baddiel, Hugh Laurie, and Alfred Molina. Initially Molina was cast as Rimmer, however, the role was recast and filled by Chris Barrie, a professional voice-actor and impressionist. Barrie, who had originally auditioned for Lister, was familiar with Rob Grant and Doug Naylor having worked together on Son of Clich√© and Spitting Image and with the producers on Happy Families and various Jasper Carrott productions. He has appeared in all but four episodes of the show, which he missed in series VII due to scheduling conflicts. Rimmer was played by Chris Eigeman in the first American pilot and then by Anthony Fusco in the second pilot. The character's distinctive 'H' was replaced with a marble-shaped object in the first pilot, but the 'H' returned in the second one. Chris Barrie was given an offer to reprise his role, but turned it down for fear of being tied into a restrictive, long-term contract, which is common in American television production. The female Rimmer in the Series II episode \\"Parallel Universe\\" was played by Suzanne Bertish, an actress primarily known for her classical stage work. She had been asked by director Ed Bye to play the part. \\"Young Rimmer\\", who had minor speaking roles in three episodes in Series III and IV, was played by child actor Simon Gaffney. Series X episode \\"The Beginning\\" features another \\"Young Rimmer\\", this time at college on Io, who was played by Philip Labey.

Geography Sculpture of Brown Trout at the northern entrance to Gore The town of Gore is located on State Highway 1 64 kilometres northeast of Invercargill and 70 km west of Balclutha - Dunedin and Invercargill are the nearest cities. The Gore District has a resident population of The urban area estimated resident population at the was , the second largest in Southland. Gore is a service town for the surrounding farm communities. It is divided by the Mataura River into Gore and East Gore, the majority of the town being situated on the western banks of the river. The Main South Line railway from Christchurch to Invercargill runs through the town, though passenger services ceased in 2002 with the cancellation of the Southerner. Gore was once a busy railway junction; the Waimea Plains Railway ran west to connect with the Kingston Branch in Lumsden, while the Waikaka Branch connected with the Main South Line nearby in McNab. The original Kingston Flyer ran between Gore, on the main Dunedin-Invercargill line, and Kingston, from where lake steamers provided a connection with Queenstown. It was withdrawn in 1937, although specials continued into the 1950s. The 1970s revival of the Flyer did not include Gore. =Climate= In K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system, it has an oceanic climate. Media The FM Hokonui radio station broadcasts from Gore to listeners in Southland and South Otago. Locally owned radio station Cave FM broadcasts in Gore and online. History Before the arrival of Europeans the current site of Gore was a part of or near the routes used by Maori travellers. Tuturau, near modern Mataura, was the nearest Maori settlement. In 1836 southern Maori repelled a raid from the north, which provided sufficient security for Europeans to purchase land and settle in the area. By the mid-1850s large tracts nearby had been converted into sheep runs. As crossing the Mataura River involved a long fording, the locality became known as \\"the Long Ford\\", or Longford. In 1862 a few town sections were surveyed on the west bank of the river and Longford was named Gore as a compliment to Sir Thomas Gore Browne, an early Governor of New Zealand. One of the first buildings was Long Ford House an accommodation house opened by local sawmill owner Daniel Morton A village named Gordon after Governor Sir Arthur Gordon became established on the opposite bank of the Mataura. By 1864 a road from Balclutha through Gore to Invercargill had been opened for wheeled traffic which allowed the establishment of a regular coach service between Invercargill and Dunedin. =Establishment= By 1877 there were enough business opportunities in the area for the Bank of New Zealand to establish a branch in Gore. Within another three years both the Bank of Australasia and the Colonial Bank of New Zealand had also opened branches. In 1899 the Bank of New South Wales followed suit. After its construction began in the early 1870s, a railway line between Invercargill and Gore was opened on 30 August 1875. By 22 January 1879 the railway had been extended to Balclutha where it linked with an existing line to Dunedin. A private Waimea Plains railway from Gore to Lumsden was opened on 31 July 1880. This was subsequently purchased by the Government in 1886. It connected Gore with the Invercargill-Kingston branch line. By 1908 another branch had been completed via McNab to Waikaka. The extension of the railways established Gore as an important hub and had a significant effect on its development. By 1879, the \\"Ensign\\" newspaper was being published in the town, followed in 1887 by the rival \\"Standard\\". =Borough= In 1885 Gore was constituted a borough and in 1890 Gordon, by now commonly known as East Gore, amalgamated with Gore. Gore acquired a nickname of \\"Chicago of the South\\". By 1905 the population had increased to 2,354, compared with 1,618 in 1891. The establishment of the Gore Electric Light & Power Syndicate led in 1894 to Gore becoming the third town in New Zealand to install a generator and provide a public electricity supply.Reilly, Helen: \\"Connecting the Country ‚Äì New Zealand‚Äôs national grid 1886-2007\\". Page 65. Steele Roberts, Wellington. . From the end of the Second World War until 1976 Gore enjoyed prosperity driven by record prices for agricultural produce which saw the town‚Äôs population rise from 5,000 in 1945 to 9,000 in 1976. By the late 1960s it was reputed to have the highest per-capita retail turnover of any New Zealand town. =Decline= The farm sector went into decline after 1976 which led to a corresponding decline in the population. Related businesses also closed, including the town‚Äôs iconic cereal mill, which had processed oats and other grains since 1877. Since 2000 prosperity has returned as large numbers of farms in the surrounding area were converted to dairy farms to take advantage of high prices for dairy produce. This growth has led to low unemployment in the town. =Marae= O Te Ika Rama Marae is located in Gore. It is a marae (meeting ground) of the Hokonui R≈´nanga branch of NgƒÅi Tahu, and includes O Te Ika Rama wharenui (meeting house). In October 2020, the Government committed $424,567 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae, creating eight jobs. Education Gore and surrounding districts have various primary, intermediate and high schools. The two secondary schools in Gore are: *Gore High School (the largest school in Gore) *St Peter's College (Roman Catholic school) The only intermediate school in Gore is *Longford Intermediate School. Opened in 1972. There are four primary schools in Gore: *East Gore School *Gore Main School. Opened on 4 October 1878 with 40 pupils. Destroyed by fire on 3 July 1896. This second school was destroyed by fire on7 May 1920 and a replacement was opened in February 1922. With the existing structure reaching the end of its useful life the fourth school on the site on 7 December 1984. *St Marys School *West Gore School There are also another 6 primary schools in the Gore District: *Knapdale School *Mataura School *Otama School *Pukerau School *Waikaka School *Willowbank School Culture and arts Gore is well known for its connection with Country and Western music, with the annual New Zealand country music awards having been held in the town for 36 years. It has a sister city relationship with Tamworth, New South Wales, the \\"Country Music Capital of Australia\\". Recently Gore has also gained a reputation as a centre for the visual arts in the southern South Island. A major bequest to the town's Eastern Southland Art Gallery by Dr. John Money has left the institution with one of the country's best collections of ethnological art. This is partnered by an impressive collection of modern New Zealand work, including several notable pieces by Ralph Hotere. Landmarks and notable features Fleming's Rolled Oats factory, a major landmark in central Gore. The Flemings \\"Creamoata Mill\\" is an iconic local building, with Flemings \\"Creamoata\\" brand of porridge once promoted by Flemings as the National Breakfast, and the mill itself considered one of the most modern cereal mills in the southern hemisphere. Production of all products was moved to Australia in 2001, and Creamoata was discontinued in 2008 after declining sales. Goodman Fielder claimed that the plant was no longer viable as it was operating at less than one third of its capacity. The building's famous \\"Sgt Dan\\" remains because rights to it have been purchased by the buildings current owner \\"Sgt Dan Stockfoods Ltd\\". The building has a Category I listing with Heritage New Zealand. The former East Gore Presbyterian Church is one of the two remaining wooden Gothic churches designed by the eminent architect R.A. Lawson. Built in 1880 and registered as a category 2 historic place by Heritage New Zealand, the main building is currently used as a performance and lecture theatre and the hall, built later, as a studio and flat for visiting artists.

Jesse ,churchofjesuschrist.org: \\"Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide\\" (retrieved 2012-02-25), IPA-ified from ¬´jƒïs'ƒì¬ª or Yishai ( ‚Äì Yi≈°ay, in pausa ‚Äì Yi≈°ƒÅy, meaning \\"King\\" or \\"God exists\\" or \\"Lord God's in-law gift\\"; ‚Äì Eshai; ‚Äì Iessa√≠; ) is a figure described in the Bible as the father of David, who became the king of the Israelites. His son David is sometimes called simply \\"Son of Jesse\\". The role as both father of King David and tribal ancestor of Christ has been used in various depictions in art, e.g. as the Tree of Jesse or in hymns like \\"Lo, how a rose e'er blooming.\\"  Biblical background  =Narrative= According to the Bible, Jesse was the son of Obed and the grandson of Ruth and of Boaz. He lived in Bethlehem, in Judea, and was of the Tribe of Judah, he was a farmer, breeder and owner of goats. He was a prominent resident of the town of Bethlehem.1 Samuel 16:1 Jesse is important in Judaism because he was the father of the most famous King of Israel. He is important in Christianity, in part because he is in the Old Testament and mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus. Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of six ancient Israelites who suppossedly died without sin, the other five being Benjamin, Caleb Cain, Epharim, Saraphim, and Manaphim. The Book of Samuel states that Jesse had eight sons, naming the first three as Eliab, Abinadab and Shammah, and David as the youngest. The Book of Chronicles names seven sons of Jesse‚ÄîEliab, Abinadab, Shimea, Nethanel, Raddai, Ozem and David‚Äîas well as two daughters, Zeruiah and Abigail. Among his grandchildren were the three sons of Zeruiah: Abishai, Joab and Asahel; and Amasa, the son of Abigail. One day the prophet Samuel came to Bethlehem sent by God, to anoint the next king of Israel. Ostensibly, his visit to Bethlehem was to offer a sacrifice to God. He used that excuse because he was afraid that King Saul might kill him if he suspected the true reason for his arrival in Bethlehem. Samuel offered a sacrifice with Jesse and then went to his house, where he sanctified him and his family. The prophet asked Jesse to present his sons. When Samuel saw Eliab, Jesse's eldest son, he was impressed by his stature and convinced that he must be God's anointed king, however, God said to Samuel, \\"Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\\" (1 Samuel 16:7 NIV). When Jesse presented his second son, Abinadab, God told Samuel, \\"The Lord has not chosen this one either\\" (1 Samuel 16:8 NIV). This happened again with his third son, Shammah, then his fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh sons. Finally, Samuel inquired of Jesse if he had any other sons. Jesse told him that David the youngest was tending the flock. The prophet then asked for him to be brought in from tending the sheep. Samuel waited, and when he arrived God asked the prophet to anoint David as king over Israel (1 Samuel 16:13). Some time later, Saul, suffering from depression and melancholy, asked Jesse for his son David to play the harp for him, since he had heard that David played the harp beautifully. Jesse sent his son along with some gifts for the King. The King was so taken with David's harp playing that he asked Jesse to keep him in his court to play for him whenever he was depressed. Later on Jesse sent his son David with gifts to be given to his older brothers who were to fight in the war against the Philistines in Saul's army. Years later David fled to the desert away from Saul, who sought to kill David in order for him to stay in power and not have his throne be taken away from him. David, worried about the safety of his parents, went to Mizpah in Moab, to ask permission from the King to allow his father Jesse and his mother to stay under the royal protection of the King. They stayed there until David's fortunes took a turn for the better. =In prophecy= Russian icon The name Jesse is referenced in the Old Testament, and in particular the passages of Isaiah, Chapter 11, Verses 1‚Äì3: Also Chapter 11, Verse 10: These are two of the verses regarded by Christians as prophecy of the advent of Jesus, whom they consider to be the Christ and Messiah. These two prophecies are regarded by Bah√°'√≠s as referring to Bah√°'u'll√°h, alleged to also have arisen from \\"the stump of Jesse\\". These prophecies are also regarded in Latter-Day Saint Movement about the coming Root of Jesse, an ensign who holds special priesthood keys and a gathering of the Lord's people.Doctrine and Covenants Section 113 verses 5-6  Tomb of Jesse  Tomb of Jesse and Ruth in Hebron. The Tomb of Ruth and Jesse is an old stone structure on a hilltop in Hebron which today serves as a synagogue. It receives numerous visitors every year, especially on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot when the Book of Ruth is read. The 1537 book Yihus HaAvos V'Neviim (Lineage of the Patriarch and the Prophets) describes the tomb as \\"a handsome building up on the mount, where Jesse, the King David's father is buried.\\" It includes a drawing of the site, and notes an \\"ancient Israelite burial ground\\" nearby and Crusader courtyard. Rabbi Moshe Basola wrote in his travel journal that the site houses a cave which connects to the Tomb of Machpela, an assertion postulated by many over the years. The site was refurbished in 2009.

Once established, a typical DCC session runs independently from the IRC server. Originally designed to be used with ircII it is now supported by many IRC clients. Some peer-to-peer clients on napster-protocol servers also have DCC send/get capability, including TekNap, SunshineUN and Lopster. A variation of the DCC protocol called SDCC (Secure Direct Client-to-Client), also known as DCC SCHAT supports encrypted connections. An RFC specification on the use of DCC does not exist. DCC connections can be initiated in two different ways: * The most common way is to use CTCP to initiate a DCC session. The CTCP is sent from one user, over the IRC network, to another user. * Another way to initiate a DCC session is for the client to connect directly to the DCC server. Using this method, no traffic will go across the IRC network (the parties involved do not need to be connected to an IRC network in order to initiate the DCC connection). History ircII was the first IRC client to implement the CTCP and DCC protocols. The CTCP protocol was implemented by Michael Sandrof in 1990 for ircII version 2.1.See the 'NOTES' and 'source/ctcp.c' files included with ircii-2.1.4e.tar.gz The DCC protocol was implemented by Troy Rollo in 1991 for version 2.1.2,See the 'UPDATES' and 'source/dcc.c' files included with ircii-2.1.4e.tar.gz but was never intended to be portable to other IRC clients. Common DCC applications =DCC CHAT= The CHAT service enables users to chat with each other over a DCC connection. The traffic will go directly between the users, and not over the IRC network. When compared to sending messages normally, this reduces IRC network load, allows sending of larger amounts of text at once, due to the lack of flood control, and makes the communication more secure by not exposing the message to the IRC servers (however, the message is still in plaintext). DCC CHAT is normally initiated using a CTCP handshake. The user wishing to establish the connection sends the following CTCP to the target: :\`DCC CHAT \` and are those of the sender, and are expressed as integers. is \\"chat\\" for standard DCC CHAT. The receiving party can then connect to the given port and address. Once a connection is established, the protocol used for DCC CHAT is very simple: users exchange CRLF-terminated messages. Messages that begin with an ASCII 001 (control-A, represented below by ^A) and the word \\"ACTION\\", and are terminated by another ASCII 001, are interpreted as emotes: :\`^AACTION waves goodbye^A\` DCC Whiteboard This is an extension to DCC CHAT, allowing simple drawing commands to be sent as well as lines of text. DCC Whiteboard is initiated with a handshake similar to DCC CHAT, with the protocol \\"chat\\" replaced by \\"wboard\\": :\`DCC CHAT wboard \` Once the connection is established, the two clients exchange CRLF-terminated messages. Messages that begin (and optionally end) with ASCII 001 are interpreted as special commands; the command ACTION represents an emote, while others cause lines to be drawn on the user's whiteboard surface, or allow the two clients to negotiate a set of features. =DCC SEND = The SEND service allows users to send files to one another. The original specification for the handshake did not allow the receiver to know the total file size nor to resume a transfer. This has made clients introduce their own extensions to the handshake, many of which have become widely supported. The original handshake consisted of the sender sending the following CTCP to the receiver: :\`DCC SEND \` As with DCC CHAT, and are the ip address and port where the sending machine will be listening for an incoming connection. Some clients enclose filenames with spaces in double quotes. It is common practice to add the file size as a last argument: :\`DCC SEND \` At this point, the original specification had the receiver either connect to the given address and port and wait for data, or ignore the request, but for clients supporting the DCC RESUME extension, a third alternative is to ask the sender to skip part of the file by sending the CTCP reply: :\`DCC RESUME \` If the sending client supports DCC RESUME, it will reply with: :\`DCC ACCEPT \` and the receiver can connect to the given address and port and listen for data to append to an already existing file. Data is sent to the client in blocks, each of which the client must acknowledge by sending the total number of bytes received in the form of a 32-bit network byte order integer. This slows down connections and is redundant because of TCP. The send-ahead extension relieves this problem somewhat by not waiting for the acknowledgements, but since the receiver still has to send them for every block it receives, in case the sender expects them, it is not solved completely. Another extension, TDCC, or turbo DCC, removes the acknowledgements, but requires a slightly modified handshake and is not widely supported. Older versions of TDCC replaced the word SEND in the handshake with TSEND; later versions use the word SEND but append a \\"T\\" after the handshake, making this version of TSEND compatible with other clients (as long as they can parse the modified handshake). DCC SEND exploit The DCC send exploit can refer to two bugs, a variant buffer overflow error in mIRC triggered by filenames longer than 14 characters and an input validation error in some routers manufactured by Netgear, D-Link and Linksys, triggered by the use of port . The router exploit, in particular, may be triggered when the phrase followed by at least 6 characters without spaces or newlines appears anywhere in a TCP stream on port 6667, not just when an actual DCC SEND request has been made. =DCC XMIT= The XMIT service is a modified version of DCC SEND that allows for resuming files and cuts down on wasteful traffic from the ACK longs. XMIT is not widely supported. The XMIT handshake differs somewhat from the SEND handshake. The sender sends a CTCP offering a file to the receiver: :\`DCC XMIT [ [ [ ]\` Square brackets here enclose optional parts. is the protocol to use for the transfer; only \\"clear\\" is defined presently. Unlike standard DCC SEND, can be in the additional forms of standard dotted notation for IPv4, or either hexadecimal or mixed notation for IPv6. To leave an early parameter empty, but still supply a later one, the earlier one can be specified as \\"-\\". If the receiver does not implement the protocol used, it will send back a CTCP reply of the format: :\`ERRMSG DCC CHAT unavailable\` CHAT is used here to maintain compatibility with the error messages sent by the extended DCC CHAT. If the receiver declines the transfer, it sends the following CTCP reply: :\`ERRMSG DCC CHAT declined\` Other errors are reported in the same fashion. If the receiver is willing and capable of receiving the file, it will connect to the given address and port. What happens then depends on the protocol used. In the case of the \\"clear\\" protocol, the XMIT server will, upon receiving a connection, send a 32-bit time t in network byte order, representing the file's modification time. Presumably based on the modification time of the local file, the client will then send another network byte order long, an offset which the server should seek to when sending the file. This should be set to zero if the whole file is wanted, or the size of the local file if the client wishes to resume a previous download. While faster than SEND, XMIT carries one of the same limitations in that it is impossible to tell how big the file is, unless its size is specified in the CTCP negotiation or known beforehand. Furthermore, you can not resume a file past the two gigabyte mark due to the 32-bit offset. =Passive DCC= In a normal DCC connection the initiator acts as the server, and the target is the client. Because of widespread firewalling and reduction of end-to-end transparency because of NAT, the initiator might not be able to act as a server. Various ways of asking the target to act as the server have been devised: DCC Server This extension to normal DCC SEND and CHAT was introduced by the IRC client mIRC. DCC Server has moderate support, but is not standard on all clients (see Comparison of Internet Relay Chat clients). It allows the initiation of a DCC connection by IP address, without the need of an IRC server. This is accomplished by the receiving client acting as a server (hence the name) listening (usually on port 59) for a handshake from the sender. For a CHAT, the initiator sends: :\`1000 \` The target then replies with: :\`1000 \` and the rest proceeds according to standard DCC CHAT protocol. For a SEND, the initiator sends: :\`1200 \` The target replies with: :\`1210 \` where is the offset in the file from which to start. From here the transfer proceeds as a normal DCC SEND. DCC Server also supports mIRC-style file servers and DCC GET. RDCC DCC Server provides no way specifying the port to use, so this has to be negotiated manually, which is not always possible, as one of the sides may not be a human. RDCC is a handshake mechanism for DCC Server, which in addition to the port also provides the IP address of the server, which the client might not be able to find otherwise because of host masking. It is not widely supported. The initiator requests the port the target is listening on by sending the CTCP query: :\`RDCC \` where is 'c' for chat, 's' for send and 'f' for file server. The target may then CTCP reply with: :\`RDCC 0 \` where and have the same meanings as for normal DCC SEND and CHAT. After this the initiator connects to the ip and port, and a DCC Server handshake follows. DCC REVERSE Unlike DCC Server, where the handshake is handled over a direct IP connection, DCC REVERSE has a normal CTCP handshake, similar to the one used by DCC SEND. This is not widely implemented. The sender offers a file to the receiver by sending the CTCP message: :\`DCC REVERSE \` is a 1 to 50 characters long string of ASCII characters in the range 33 to 126, and acts as an identifier for the transfer. If the receiver accepts, it sends the CTCP reply: :\`DCC REVERSE \` Here is the position in the file from which to start sending, is the IP address of the receiver in standard dotted notation for IPv4, or hexadecimal notation for IPv6. The sender then connects to the ip address and port indicated by the receiver, and a normal DCC SEND follows. Both the sender and receiver can cancel the handshake by sending the CTCP reply: :\`DCC REJECT REVERSE \` DCC RSEND This is the KVIrc client's alternative to DCC REVERSE. The sender offers a file by sending the CTCP: :\`DCC RSEND \` The receiver can then accept by CTCP replying with: :\`DCC RECV \` and the sender connects to the receiver and sends as during a normal DCC SEND. Reverse / Firewall DCC This passive DCC mechanism is supported by at least mIRC, Visual IRC, XChat, KVIrc, DMDirc, Klient, Konversation, and PhibianIRC. The sender offers a file by sending the CTCP message: :\`DCC SEND 0 \` is the IP address of the sender in network byte order, expressed as a single integer (as in standard DCC). The number 0 is sent instead of a valid port, signaling that this is a Reverse DCC request. is a unique integer; if TSEND is being used (by a client that supports it), the letter \\"T\\" is appended to the token, letting the receiver know it doesn't need to send acknowledgements. The receiver can accept the file by opening a listening socket and responding with the CTCP message: :\`DCC SEND \` This is identical to the original Reverse DCC message, except the and identify the socket where the receiver is listening. is the same as in the original request, letting the sender know which request is being accepted. (Since this message follows the same format as a regular DCC send request, some servers which filter DCC requests may require the sender to add the receiver to his or her \\"DCC allow\\" list.) The sender then connects to the receiver's socket, sends the content of the file, and waits for the receiver to close the socket when the file is finished. When the RESUME extension to the SEND protocol is used, the sequence of commands becomes (with '>>' indicating an outgoing message on the initiating side and '<<' response by its peer): :\`>> DCC SEND 0 \` :\`<< DCC RESUME 0 \` :\`>> DCC ACCEPT 0 \` :\`<< DCC SEND \` After which the protocol proceeds as normal (i.e. the sender connects to the receiver's socket). =File servers (FSERVs)= A DCC fserve, or file server, lets a user browse, read and download files located on a DCC server. Typically, this is implemented with a DCC CHAT session (which presents the user with a command prompt) or special CTCP commands to request a file. The files are sent over DCC SEND or DCC XMIT. There are many implementations of DCC file servers, among them is the FSERV command in the popular mIRC client.

A strong speaker, he became popular in trade union circles for his denunciation of capitalism as unethical and his promise of a socialist utopia. He was the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position he held in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. He broke with Labour policy in 1931, and was expelled from the party and excoriated as a turncoat, as the party was overwhelmingly crushed that year by the National Government coalition that Snowden supported. He was succeeded as Chancellor by Neville Chamberlain. Early life: 1864‚Äì1906 Snowden was born in Cowling in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His father John Snowden had been a weaver and a supporter of Chartism, and later a Gladstonian liberal. Snowden later wrote in his autobiography: \\"I was brought up in this Radical atmosphere, and it was then that I imbibed the political and social principles which I have held fundamentally ever since\\".Philip, Viscount Snowden, An Autobiography. Volume One. 1864-1919 (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), p. 19. Although his parents and sisters were involved in weaving at the Ickornshaw Mill, he did not join them; after attending a local board school (where he received additional lessons in French and Latin from the schoolmaster) he stayed on as a pupil-teacher. When he was 15 he became an insurance office clerk in Burnley. During his seven years as a clerk, he studied and then passed the civil service entry examination; in 1886, he was appointed to a junior position at the Excise Office in Liverpool. Snowden moved on to other posts around Scotland and then to Devon. In August 1891, when he was aged 27, Snowden severely injured his back in a cycling accident in Devon and was paralyzed from the waist down.\\"Lord Snowden.\\" Times [London, England] 17 May 1937: 15. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 8 September 2013. He learned to walk again with the aid of sticks within two years.Duncan Tanner, \\"Snowden, Philip, Viscount Snowden (1864‚Äì1937)]\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004; His Inland Revenue job was kept open for him for two years following the accident; however, owing to his condition, he decided to resign from the civil service. While he was convalescing at his mother's house at Cowling he began to study socialist theory and history. Snowden joined the Liberal Party, and followed his parents in becoming a Methodist and a teetotaller. In 1893, in the aftermath of the formation of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in neighboring Bradford, he was asked to give a speech for the Cowling Liberal Club on the dangers of socialism. Whilst researching the subject, Snowden instead became convinced by the ideology. He eventually joined the executive committee of the Keighley ILP in 1899, and went on to chair the ILP from 1903 to 1906. He became a prominent speaker for the party, and wrote a popular Christian socialist pamphlet with Keir Hardie in 1903, entitled The Christ that is to Be. His strident rhetoric, well-laced with statistics and evangelical themes, contrasted the evil conditions under capitalism with the moral and economic utopia of future socialism. He condemned as \\"bloodsuckers and parasites\\" local textile company executives. In 1898, he launched the Keighley Labour Journal, using it to denounce waste, pettiness, and corruption. However, he ignored the concerns of the trade unions, which he judged to be conservative and fixated on wages. By 1902, he had moved his base to Leeds and toured Britain as a lecturer on politics and corruption, with his own syndicated column and short essays in numerous working class outlets. By the time he was elected Labour MP for Blackburn in 1906, he had become a well- known socialist figure, standing at the national level alongside both Keir Hardie, Professor Arnold Lupton and Ramsay MacDonald.Millman, Brock, Domestic Dissent in First World War Britain, 2000, page 186. Snowden married Ethel Annakin, a campaigner for women's suffrage, in 1905. He supported his wife's ideals, and he became a noted speaker at suffragette meetings and other public meetings. Member of Parliament: 1906‚Äì1924 Snowden (fourth from left) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party Snowden unsuccessfully contested the Wakefield constituency in West Yorkshire in a by-election in March 1902, where he received 40 percent of the votes. In 1906, he became the Labour MP for Blackburn. He continued his writing and lectures, and now was advocating more radical measures than the ruling Liberals were implementing. He even devised his own \\"Socialist budget\\" to rival David Lloyd George's 1909 \\"People's Budget\\". Snowden was in Australia on a worldwide lecture tour when the First World War broke out in August 1914; he did not return to Britain until February 1915. He was not a pacifist; however, he did not support recruiting for the armed forces, and he campaigned against conscription. His stance was unpopular with the public and he lost his seat in the 1918 general election. In 1922, he was elected to represent Colne Valley. Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1924 Upon Ramsay MacDonald's appointment as Prime Minister in January 1924, Snowden was appointed as the Labour Party's first ever Chancellor of the Exchequer and sworn of the Privy Council. In his budget, Snowden lowered the duties on tea, coffee, cocoa, chicory and sugar; reduced spending on armaments; and provided money for council housing. However, he did not implement the capital levy. Snowden claimed that because of the lowering of duties on foodstuffs consumed by the working class, the budget went \\"far to realize the cherished radical idea of a free breakfast table\\".Time, Labor's Budget, 12 May 1924 He profoundly believed in the morality of the balanced budget, with rigorous economy and not a penny wasted. He grasped how serious unemployment was becoming, but differed with the rising belief in deficit spending as a way to combat it. A. J. P. Taylor said his budget \\"would have delighted the heart of Gladstone\\".Taylor, English History, 1914-1945, p. 212. In his first budget, Snowden earmarked ¬£38 million for the reduction of food taxes, the introduction of pensions for widows, and a reduction in the pensionable age to 65. However, only the first of these measures was realized during the first Labour Government's time in office.Foundations of the Welfare State, 2nd Edition by Pat Thane, published 1996 Opposition: 1924‚Äì1929 Although he had chaired the ILP for a second time, from 1917 to 1920, Snowden resigned from the party in 1927 because he believed it was \\"drifting more and more away from...evolutionary socialism into revolutionary socialism\\". He was also opposed to the new Keynesian economic ideas which provided a rationale for deficit spending, and criticized their expression in the Liberals' manifesto for the 1929 election, titled We can Conquer Unemployment. Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1929‚Äì1931 Snowden was again appointed Chancellor after Labour formed a government in 1929, after emerging as the largest party in the general election. His economic philosophy was one of strict Gladstonian Liberalism rather than socialism. His official biographer wrote, \\"He was raised in an atmosphere which regarded borrowing as an evil and free trade as an essential ingredient of prosperity\\". He was considered by many at the time and later as being the principal opponent to the government following any radical economic policy to tackle the Great Depression as well as blocking proposals to introduce protectionist tariffs. The government eventually collapsed over arguments about a budget deficit amidst refusals by a significant minority of ministers to enact cuts in unemployment benefit.Robert Skidelsky, Politicians and the Slump: The Labour Government of 1929-1931 (1967) Snowden retained the position of Chancellor during the National Government of 1931. As a consequence he was expelled from the party, along with MacDonald and Jimmy Thomas. In a BBC radio broadcast on 16 October 1931, he called Labour's policies \\"Bolshevism run mad\\" and contrasted them unfavourably with his own \\"sane and evolutionary Socialism\\". Snowden decided not to stand for parliament in the election of November 1931. At that election, Labour's number of seats declined catastrophically from 288 to 52. It was during that year he had prostate gland surgery, following which his health and mobility declined. Robert Skidelsky is representative of the Keynesians who have charged that Snowden and MacDonald were blinded by their economic philosophy that required balanced budgets, sound money, the gold standard and free trade, regardless of the damage that Keynesians thought it would do to the economy and the people.Skidelsky, Politicians and the Slump: The Labour Government of 1929-1931 (1967) However, with the decline of Keynesianism as a model after 1968, historians have re-evaluated Snowden in a more favourable light. Ross McKibbin argues that the Labour government had very limited room to manoeuvre in 1929‚Äì31, and it did as well as could be expected; and that it handled the British economy better than most foreign governments handled theirs, and the Great Depression was less severe in Britain than elsewhere.Ross McKibbin, \\"The Economic Policy of the Second Labour Government 1929-1931,\\" Past & Present (1975) #68 pp. 95-123 in JSTOR Later life: 1931‚Äì1937 Vera Weizmann, Chaim Weizmann, Herbert Samuel, Lloyd George, Ethel Snowden, and Philip Snowden In the 1931 Dissolution Honours he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Snowden of Ickornshaw, in the West Riding of the County of York, and served as Lord Privy Seal in the National government from 1931 to 1932, when he resigned in protest at the enactment of a full scheme of Imperial Preference and protectionist tariffs. That year, Snowden said there was never a greater mistake than to say that Cobdenism was dead: \\"Cobdenism was never more alive throughout the world than it was to- day...To-day the ideas of Cobden were in revolt against selfish nationalism. The need for the breaking down of trade restrictions, which took various forms, was universally recognized even by those who were unable to throw off those shackles\\".The Times (8 July 1932), p. 9. He subsequently wrote his Autobiography in which he strongly attacked MacDonald. In the 1935 general election, Snowden supported the Keynesian economic programme proposed by Lloyd George (\\"Lloyd George's New Deal\\"), despite it being a complete repudiation of Snowden's own classical liberal fiscal policies. Snowden claimed that he was returning to long-held economic views, but that these had been \\"temporarily inadvisable\\" during the crisis of 1931, when \\"national necessity\\" demanded cutting public expenditure. Lord Snowden died of a heart attack at his home, Eden Lodge, Tilford, Surrey on 15 May 1937, aged 72. After cremation at Woking Crematorium his ashes were scattered on Cowling Moor near Ickornshaw. His library of books and pamphlets was presented to Keighley Public Library by his widow, and a cairn was erected to his memory on Ickornshaw Moor in 1938. His viscountcy died with him. Lady Snowden died in February 1951, aged 69.

He acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne on 1 May 2019, beginning the Reiwa era, following the abdication of his father, Akihito. He is the 126th monarch according to Japan's traditional order of succession. He is the only monarch in the world to hold the title of \\"Emperor\\".  Name  During his lifetime before becoming Emperor, he was generally referred in the Japanese press by his given name and princely title. Upon succeeding to the throne, he is no longer referred to by his given name, but rather is referred to as which may be shortened to . In writing, the Emperor is also referred to formally as . The era of Naruhito's reign bears the name , and according to custom he will be renamed by order of the Cabinet after his death. The name of the next era under his successor will be established after his death or before his abdication.  Early life  Naruhito in February 1961 Naruhito was born on 23 February 1960 at 4:15 p.m. in the Imperial Household Agency Hospital in Tokyo Imperial Palace. As a prince, he later quipped, \\"I was born in a barn inside the moat\\". His parents, Akihito and Michiko, were then crown prince and crown princess of Japan, while his paternal grandfather, Hirohito, reigned as emperor. Reuters reported that Naruhito's paternal grandmother, Empress K≈çjun, had driven her daughter-in-law and grandchildren to depression in the 1960s by persistently accusing Michiko of not being suitable for her son. Naruhito's childhood was reported to be happy, and he enjoyed activities such as mountain climbing, riding and learning the violin. He played with the children of the royal chamberlain, and he was a fan of the Yomiuri Giants in the Central League, his favorite player being No. 3, later team manager, Shigeo Nagashima. One day, Naruhito found the remains of an ancient roadway in the palace grounds, sparking a lifelong fascination with the history of transportation, which would provide the subject of his bachelor's and master's degrees in history. He later said, \\"I have had a keen interest in roads since childhood. On roads you can go to the unknown world. Since I have been leading a life where I have few chances to go out freely, roads are a precious bridge to the unknown world, so to speak.\\" In August 1974, when the prince was 14, he was sent to Melbourne, Australia, for a homestay. Naruhito's father, then the Crown Prince Akihito, had had a positive experience there on a trip the year before, and encouraged his son to go as well. He stayed with the family of businessman Colin Harper. He got along with his host brothers, riding around Point Lonsdale, playing the violin and tennis, and climbing Uluru together. Once he even played the violin for dignitaries at a state dinner at Government House hosted by Governor-General Sir John Kerr.  Education  Naruhito in 1990 When Naruhito was four years old he was enrolled in the prestigious Gakush≈´in school system, where many of Japan's elite families and narikin (nouveaux riches) send their children. In senior high, Naruhito joined the geography club. Naruhito graduated from Gakushuin University in March 1982 with a Bachelor of Letters degree in history. In July 1983 he entered a three- month intensive English course before entering Merton College, Oxford University, in the United Kingdom, where he studied until 1986. Naruhito did not, however, submit his thesis A Study of Navigation and Traffic on the Upper Thames in the 18th Century until 1989. He later revisited these years in his book, The Thames and I - a Memoir of Two Years at Oxford. He visited some 21 historic pubs, including the Trout Inn. Naruhito joined the Japan Society and the drama society, and became the honorary president of the karate and judo clubs. He played inter-college tennis, seeded number three out of six on the Merton team, and took golf lessons from a pro. In his three years at Merton he also climbed the highest peaks in three of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom: Scotland's Ben Nevis, Wales' Snowdon and Scafell Pike in England. While at Oxford, Naruhito also was able to go sightseeing across Europe and meet much of its royalty, including the British royal family. The relatively relaxed manners of the United Kingdom's royals amazed him: \\"Queen Elizabeth II, he noted with surprise, poured her own tea and served the sandwiches.\\" He also went skiing with Liechtenstein's Prince Hans-Adam II, holidayed in Mallorca in the Mediterranean with Spain's King Juan Carlos I, and sailed with Norway's Crown Prince Harald and Crown Princess Sonja and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Upon his return to Japan, Naruhito enrolled once more in Gakush≈´in University to earn a Master of Humanities degree in history, successfully earning his degree in 1988.  Personal life  Naruhito and Masako in May 2019 Marriage ceremony of Prince Naruhito and Masako Owada = Marriage and family = Naruhito first met Masako Owada (staff working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) at a tea for Infanta Elena of Spain in November 1986, during her studies at the University of Tokyo. The prince was immediately captivated by her, and arranged for them to meet several times over the next few weeks. Because of this, they were pursued relentlessly by the press throughout 1987. Despite the Imperial Household Agency's disapproval of Masako Owada, and her attending Balliol College, Oxford, for the next two years, Naruhito remained interested in Masako who worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He proposed to her three times before the Imperial Palace announced their engagement on 19 January 1993. The wedding took place on 9 June the same year at the Imperial Shinto Hall in Tokyo before 800 invited guests, including many of Europe's heads of state and royalty. By the time of their marriage, Naruhito's grandfather Emperor Sh≈çwa (Hirohito) had died, so Naruhito had been invested as the Crown Prince with the title on 23 February 1991. Masako's first pregnancy was announced in December 1999, but she miscarried. Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako have one daughter, , born 1 December 2001 at the Imperial Household Agency Hospital in Tokyo Imperial Palace. = Hobbies and interests = Naruhito is interested in water policy and water conservation. In March 2003, in his capacity as honorary president of the Third World Water Forum, he delivered a speech at the forum's opening ceremony titled \\"Waterways Connecting Kyoto and Local Regions\\". Visiting Mexico in March 2006, he gave the keynote address at the opening ceremony for the Fourth World Water Forum, \\"Edo and Water Transport\\". And in December 2007, he gave a commemorative talk at the opening ceremony for the First Asia- Pacific Water Summit, \\"Humans and Water: From Japan to the Asia-Pacific Region\\". Naruhito plays the viola, having switched from the violin because he thought the latter \\"too much of a leader, too prominent\\" to suit his musical and personal tastes. He enjoys jogging, hiking, and mountaineering in his spare time. Crown Prince of Japan Naruhito in Brazil, 18 June 2008 The Crown Prince was a patron of the Japanese Olympic Games Committee. The prince is also a supporter of the World Organization of the Scout Movement and in 2006 attended the 14th Nippon Jamboree, the Japanese national jamboree organized by the Scout Association of Japan. The crown prince has also been an honorary vice-president of the Japanese Red Cross Society since 1994. For two weeks in 2012, Naruhito temporarily took charge of his father's duties while the Emperor underwent and recovered from heart bypass surgery. Naruhito's birthday was named \\"Mount Fuji Day\\" by Shizuoka and Yamanashi Prefectures because of his reported love of the mountain.„ÄåÊ¢ÖÂéüÁåõ„ÉªÂ∑ùÂãùÂπ≥Â§™„ÄéÊó•Êú¨ÊÄùÊÉ≥„ÅÆÂè§Â±§„ÄèËó§ÂéüÊõ∏Â∫ó„ÄÅ2017, p. 14„Äç Emperor of Japan  On 1 December 2017, the government announced that Naruhito's father, Emperor Akihito, would abdicate on 30 April 2019, and that Naruhito would become the 126th emperor of Japan as of 1 May 2019. Following an abdication ceremony on the afternoon of 30 April, Akihito's reign and the Heisei era continued until the end of the day. Naruhito then succeeded him as emperor at the beginning of the day on 1 May, ushering in the Reiwa era. The transition took place at midnight. Naruhito's place as emperor was formalized in a ceremony on the morning of 1 May. In his first statement as emperor, he pledged to reflect deeply on the course followed by his father, and fulfill his constitutional responsibility \\"as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people of Japan\\". Naruhito's enthronement ceremony took place on 22 October 2019, where he was duly enthroned in an ancient-style proclamation ceremony.Japan emperor proclaims enthromement in ancient-style ceremony Unlike most other constitutional monarchs, Naruhito is not the nominal chief executive. The Constitution explicitly defines the emperor's role as entirely ceremonial and representative, with no powers related to government. His few powers are ceremonial duties that he is required to perform by the requirements of the Constitution and the binding advice of the Cabinet. For instance, while he formally appoints the Prime Minister, he is required to appoint the person designated by the National Diet, without the option to decline appointment.

It has the largest circulation of any newspaper in Southwestern Ontario.  History  The London Free Press began as the Canadian Free Press, founded by William Sutherland. It first began printing as a weekly newspaper on January 2, 1849. In 1852, it was purchased for $500 by Josiah Blackburn (and Stephen Blackburn), who renamed it The London Free Press and Daily Western Advertiser. In 1855 Blackburn turned the weekly newspaper into a daily. From 1863 to 1936 The London Free Press competed for readership with the London Advertiser, which was a daily evening newspaper. The Free Press has usually been a morning paper, but for many years, it also published an evening paper. Both morning and evening editions were published from the 1950s through to 1981, when the evening edition was permanently retired. The Blackburn family was also involved in other forms of media in London. They established CFPL in 1933, CFPL-FM in 1948 and CFPL-TV in 1953. The radio stations are now owned by Corus Entertainment, and the television station is owned by Bell Media as a CTV 2 station. The sudden death of publisher Martha Blackburn in the summer of 1992, due to a heart attack after water skiing on Lake Huron, set the stage for the eventual sale of the family owned newspaper. In 1997 the Blackburn family sold the newspaper to Sun Media Corporation, with new, London-born publisher John Paton introducing a Sunday edition. Later the same year, Sun Media was acquired by Quebecor Inc. In late August 2005, Quebecor announced that, starting in 2007, The London Free Press would no longer be printed locally at its press at 369 York Street; instead it would be printed at a new press facility to be built north of Toronto, resulting in a loss of 180 local jobs. However, in September 2007, the move was suspended to allow the Free Press to present a business case for the printing department and staff's retention. The Free Press has one of the few printing presses in southern Ontario and it prints several papers for Sun Media newspapers in the area, including the Chatham Daily News, the Sarnia Observer, the Simcoe Reformer, the St. Thomas Times-Journal, the Stratford Beacon Herald, the Woodstock Sentinel-Review and the Londoner, along with the Free Press. In 2015, Sun Media was acquired by Postmedia. On May 31, 2016 Sun Media announced that they will outsource the printing of the Free Press to Metroland Media Group's printing facility in Hamilton.  Circulation  The London Free Press has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 60,426 copies daily from 2009 to 2015. :::::::::Daily average Figures refer to the total circulation (print and digital combined) which includes paid and unpaid copies.

Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to enact desired changes themselves.St. John Barned-Smith, \\"How We Rage: This Is Not Your Parents' Protest,\\" Current (Winter 2007): 17‚Äì25. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful nonviolent campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance. Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted by governmental policy (such as the requirement of protest permits), economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or media monopoly. One state reaction to protests is the use of riot police. Observers have noted an increased militarization of protest policing in many countries, with police deploying armored vehicles and snipers against protesters. When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open civil disobedience, more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as culture and emigration. A protest itself may at times be the subject of a counter-protest. In such cases, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, policy, action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest. Protesters and counter-protesters can sometimes violently clash. Historical notions Protesters against big government fill the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall, 12 September 2009 An artist's depiction of a prototypical angry mob protesting with the threat of violence Unaddressed protests may grow and widen into civil resistance, dissent, activism, riots, insurgency, revolts, and political or social revolution. Some examples of protests include: * Northern Europe in the early 16th century (Protestant Reformation) * North America in the 1770s (American Revolution) * Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, an anti-government protest by several hundred soldiers of the Continental Army * France in 1789 (French Revolution) * Haiti in 1803 (Haitian Revolution), the first successful black revolution against slavery * The Haymarket riot in 1886, a violent labor protest led by the Anarchist Movement * New York shirtwaist strike of 1909 * Mohandas Gandhi's 1930 Salt March to protest British rule in India * Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a key moment in the Civil Rights Movement * Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965, part of the Civil Rights Movement * Protests against the Vietnam War * Mexico 68 * The Stonewall riots in 1969, protesting the treatment of homosexuals in New York City * The People Power Revolution in the Philippines * The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 * The Alexanderplatz demonstrations from November 4‚Äì9, 1989, which culminated in the Fall of the Berlin Wall * The many ACT-UP AIDS protests of the late 1980s and early 1990s * The Seattle WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity against the World Trade Organization * Anti-globalization protests in Prague in 2000 * Anti-globalization protests in Genoa from 18 to 22 July 2001 * 15 February 2003 Iraq War Protest * The First Intifada and Second Intifada in Palestine * Anti-nuclear protests * 2007 Bersih rally * 2010 Thai political protests * 2011 Iranian protests * Arab Spring protests * Impact of the Arab Spring * 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests * Gezi Park protests in 2013 in Turkey * June 2013 Egyptian protests * Euromaidan protests in Ukraine, November 2013‚ÄìFebruary 2014 * Black Lives Matter-led protests on July 13, 2013 * Sunflower Student Movement * 2014 Hong Kong Umbrella Movement * 2016 South Korean protests * 2017 Jallikattu protests * Dakota Access Pipeline protests * 2018 Tommy Robinson protests * 2018 Sadiq Khan protests * March for Our Lives protests * 2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution * 2018-2019 Sudanese protests * 2018‚Äì2020 Serbian protests * 2019 Venezuelan protests * 2019 Indonesian protests * 2019 Bolivian protests * 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests * Citizenship Amendment Act protests * 2019‚Äì20 Lebanese protests * George Floyd protests from May 26, 2020‚Äìpresent * 2020 Belarusian protests * Protests over responses to the COVID-19 pandemic * COVID-19 protests and riots in Serbia * Forms of protest Protestor with a \\"Free The Bee\\" placard during the COVID-19 protests in Berlin on 29th of August 2020, near the Brandenburg Gate A protest can take many forms. The Dynamics of Collective Action project and the Global Nonviolent Action DatabaseGlobal Nonviolent Action Database are two of the leading data collection efforts attempting to capture protest events. The Dynamics of Collective Action project considers the repertoire of protest tactics (and their definitions) to include: * Rally or demonstration: Demonstration, rally, or similar protest, without reference to marching or walking in a picket line or standing in a vigil. Reference to speeches, speakers, singing, or preaching, often verified by the presence of PA sound equipment and sometimes by a platform or stage. Ordinarily will include worship services, speeches, briefings. * March: Reference to moving from one location to another; to distinguish from rotating or walking in a circle with picket signs (which is a picket). * Vigil: Most vigils have banners, placards, or leaflets so that people passing by, despite silence from participants, can be informed about the purpose of the vigil. * Picket: The modal activity is picketing; there may be references to a picket line, informational picketing, or holding signs; \\"carrying signs and walking around in a circle\\". Holding signs, placards, or banners is not the defining criteria; rather, it is holding or carrying those items and walking a circular route, a phrase sometimes surprisingly found in the permit application. * Civil disobedience: Explicit protest that involves deliberately breaking laws deemed unjust in order to protest them; crossing barricades, prohibited use of segregated facilities (such as lunch-counters or restrooms), voter registration drives (to earn non-eligible people the right to vote), or tying up phone lines. * Ceremony: These celebrate or protest status transitions ranging from birth and death dates of individuals, organizations or nations; seasons; re-enlistment or commissioning of military personnel; or to anniversaries of any of the above. These are sometimes referenced by presenting flowers or wreaths commemorating, dedicating, or celebrating status transitions or their anniversary; e.g., an annual merchant marine memorial service, celebrating Chanukah or Easter, or celebrating the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. * Dramaturgical demonstration * Motorcade: Vehicular procession (electoral campaigns or other issues) * Information distribution: Tabling/petition gathering, lobbying, letter-writing campaigns, or teach-ins. * Symbolic display: e.g., a menorah or creche scene, graffiti, cross burning, sign, or standing display. * Attack by collective group (not-one-on-one assault, crime, rape): Motivation for attack is the \\"other group's identity\\", as in gay- bashing or lynching. Can also include verbal attacks or threats. (See hate crime) * Riot, melee, mob violence: Large-scale (50+), use of violence by instigators against persons, property, police, or buildings separately or in combination, lasting several hours. * Strike, slow down, sick-ins, and employee work protest of any kind: Regular air strike through failure of negotiations or wildcat air strike. (Make note if a wildcat strike.) * Boycott: Organized refusal to buy or use a product or service. Examples: rent strikes, Montgomery bus boycotts * Press conference: Only if specifically named as such in report, and must be the predominant activity form. Could involve disclosure of information to \\"educate the public\\" or influence various decision-makers. * Organization formation announcement or meeting announcement: Meeting or press conference to announce the formation of a new organization. * Conflict, attack or clash (no instigator): This includes any boundary conflict in which no instigator can be identified, i.e. Black/white conflicts, abortion/anti-abortion conflicts. *Prayer Walk: A prayer walk is an activity that consists of walking and praying at the same time. * Lawsuit: Legal maneuver by social movement organization or group. *Peopleless Protest: Simultaneous online and offline protests involving physical representations of protesters in public spaces that are subsequently assembled online. Developed in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Global Nonviolent Action Database uses Gene Sharp's classification of 198 methods of nonviolent action. There is considerable overlap with the Dynamics of Collective Action repertoire, although the GNA repertoire includes more specific tactics. Together, the two projects help define tactics available to protesters and document instances of their use. Typology March next to the Benito Ju√°rez Hemicycle, 27 August 1968, Mexico City Abhishek Tiwari (8-B) and Lori Hall have devised a typology of six broad activity categories of the protest activities described in the Dynamics of Collective Action project. * Literal, symbolic, aesthetic and sensory - Artistic, dramaturgical, and symbolic displays (street theater, dancing, etc.) including use of images, objects, graphic art, musical performances, or vocal/auditory exhibitions (speech-making, chanting, etc.). May also include tactile exchanges of information (petitions, leaflets, etc.) and the destruction of objects of symbolic or political value. Highly visible and most diverse category of activity; impacts on society (police response, media focus, impact on potential allies, etc.) often are underestimated. * Solemnity and the sacred ‚Äì Vigils, prayer, or rallies, in the form of religious service, candlelight vigils, cross or coffin bearing etc. All directly related to the Durkheimian \\"sacred\\", or some form of religious or spiritual practice, belief, or ideology. Events where sacred activity is the primary focus are rarely responded to by police with force or presence. Solemnity usually provides a distinct quietness or stillness, changing the energy, description, and interpretation of such events. * Institutional and conventional ‚Äì Institutionalized activity or activity highly dependent on formal political processes and social institutions (press conferences, lawsuits, lobbying, etc.). Often conflated with non-confrontational and nonviolent activities in research as the other or reference category. More acceptable because it operates, to some degree, within the system. Historically contentious issue in regard to the practice of protest due to this integration within the system. * Movement in space ‚Äì Marches or parades (processional activities) from one spatio-temporal location to another, with beginning or ending places sometimes chosen for symbolic reasons. Picket lines often used in labor strikes but can be used by non-labor actors but the key differences between picket and processionals are the distance of movement. Events that take the form of a procession are logistically much more difficult to police (even if it is for the safety of protesters). Marches are some of the largest events in this period. * Civil disobedience ‚Äì Withholding obligations, sit-ins, blockades, occupations, bannering, \\"camping\\", etc., are all specific activities which constitute the tactical form of civil disobedience. In some way, these activities directly or technically break the law. Usually given most attention by researchers, media, and authorities. Often conflated with violence and threats because of direct action and confrontational nature, but should serve as a distinct category of action (both in the context of tactical and strategic planning and in the control of activity). * Collective violence and threats ‚Äì Collective violence such as pushing, shoving, hitting, punching, damaging property, throwing objects, verbal threats, etc., is usually committed by a relative few out of many protesters (even tens of thousands). It is rare in occurrence and rarely condoned by the public or onlookers (particularly the media). Usually met with equivalent or overwhelming force in response by authorities. At times in U.S. history, lauded as the only way to get results, but there is little empirical evidence violence succeeds in goal attainment. Some forms of direct action listed in this article are also public demonstrations or rallies. * Protest march, a historically and geographically common form of nonviolent action by groups of people. * Picketing, a form of protest in which people congregate outside a place of work or location where an event is taking place. Often, this is done in an attempt to dissuade others from going in (\\"crossing the picket line\\"), but it can also be done to draw public attention to a cause. * Street protesters demonstrate in areas with high visibility, often employing handmade placards such as sandwich boards or picket signs in order to maximize exposure and interaction with the public. * Lockdowns and lock-ons are a way to stop movement of an object like a structure or tree, and to thwart the removal of actual protesters from the location. Users employ various chains, locks and even the sleeping dragon for impairment of those trying to remove them with a matrix of composted materials. * Die-ins are a form of protest where participants simulate being dead (with varying degrees of realism). In the simplest form of a die-in, protesters simply lie down on the ground and pretend to be dead, sometimes covering themselves with signs or banners. Much of the effectiveness depends on the posture of the protesters, for when not properly executed, the protest might look more like a \\"sleep-in\\". For added realism, simulated wounds are sometimes painted on the bodies, or bandages, usually made to appear bloody, are used. * Protest song is a song which protests perceived problems in society. Every major movement in Western history has been accompanied by its own collection of protest songs, from slave emancipation to women's suffrage, the labor movement, civil rights, the anti-war movement, the feminist movement, the environmental movement. Over time, the songs have come to protest more abstract, moral issues, such as injustice, racial discrimination, the morality of war in general (as opposed to purely protesting individual wars), globalization, inflation, social inequalities, and incarceration. * Radical cheerleading. The idea is to ironically re-appropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, for example by changing the chants to promote feminism and left-wing causes. Many radical cheerleaders (some of whom are male, transgender or non-gender identified) are in appearance far from the stereotypical image of a cheerleader. * Critical Mass bike rides have been perceived as protest activities. A 2006 New Yorker article described Critical Mass' activity in New York City as \\"monthly political-protest rides\\", and characterized Critical Mass as a part of a social movement; the U.K. e-zine Urban75, which advertises as well as publishes photographs of the Critical Mass event in London, describes this as \\"the monthly protest by cyclists reclaiming the streets of London\\". However, Critical Mass participants have insisted that these events should be viewed as \\"celebrations\\" and spontaneous gatherings, not as protests or organized demonstrations. This stance allows Critical Mass to argue a legal position that its events can occur without advance notification of local police. * Toyi-toyi is a Southern African dance originally from Zimbabwe that became famous for its use in political protests in the apartheid-era South Africa. See Protest in South Africa. =Written demonstration= Written evidence of political or economic power, or democratic justification may also be a way of protesting. * Petitions * Letters (to show political power by the volume of letters): Used by some letter writing campaigns, especially those with a form letter that supporters are given to sign =Civil disobedience demonstrations= A protester photobombing a news reporter during a protest in New York City Any protest could be civil disobedience if a \\"ruling authority\\" says so, but the following are usually civil disobedience demonstrations: * Public nudity or topfree (to protest indecency laws or as a publicity stunt for another protest such as a war protest) or animal mistreatment (e.g. PETA's campaign against fur). See also Nudity and protest. * Sit-in * Photobombing ‚Äì disrupting an event being broadcast live * Raasta roko ‚Äì people blocking auto traffic with their bodies * Silent protest =As a residence= * Peace camp * Formation of a tent city * Camp for Climate Action =Destructive= Black bloc members spray graffiti during an Iraq War Protest in Washington, D.C.https://www.flickr.com Image of black bloc members during an Iraq War protest in Washington, D.C., 21 March 2009 * Vandalism ‚Äì Smashing windows or spraying graffiti is used as a form of riot, and is sometimes employed by black bloc groups. * Riot ‚Äì Protests or attempts to end protests sometimes lead to rioting. * Looting ‚Äì stealing goods from establishments or businesses (takes place during riots) * Self-immolation * Suicide * Hunger strike * Bombing =Non-destructive= * Silent protest ‚Äì protests or parades in which participants are nonviolent and usually silent in an attempt to avoid violent confrontation with military or police forces. This tactic was effectively used during the Arab Spring in cities such as Tehran and Cairo. =Direct action= * Civil resistance * Nonviolent resistance * Occupation * Public Shaming =Against a government= The District of Columbia issues license plates protesting the \\"taxation without representation\\" that occurs due to its special status. * Tax resistance * Conscientious objector * Flag desecration =Against a military shipment= * Port Militarization Resistance ‚Äì protests which attempt to prevent military cargo shipments =Against a planning application or development= * NIMBY (\\"not in my backyard\\") ‚Äì protest by residents of an area against a development in the area they see as undesirable =By government employees= Protest inside the Wisconsin State Capitol * Bully pulpit * Judicial activism * Filibuster =Job action= * Strike action * Walkout * Work-to-rule =In sports= During a sporting event, under certain circumstances, one side may choose to play a game \\"under protest\\", usually when they feel the rules are not being correctly applied. The event continues as normal, and the events causing the protest are reviewed after the fact. If the protest is held to be valid, then the results of the event are changed. Each sport has different rules for protests. =By management= * Lockout =By tenants= * Rent strike =By consumers= * Boycott * Consumer Court =Information= * Informative letters, letter writing campaigns, letters to the editor * Teach-in * Zine * Soap-boxing =Civil disobedience to censorship= * Samizdat (distributing censored materials) * Protest graffiti =By Internet and social networking= Occupy Wall Street protesters in Zuccotti Park using the Internet to get their message out over social networking as events happen, September 2011Blogging and social networking have become effective tools to register protest and grievances. Protests can express views or news, and use viral networking to reach out to thousands of people. With protests on the rise from the U.S. election season of 2016 going into 2017, protesters became aware that using their social media during a protest could make them an easier target for government surveillance. =Literature, art and culture= * Culture jamming =Against religious or ideological institutions= * Recusancy * Book burning Economic effects against companies Protest march in Palmerston North, New Zealand Protesters outside the Oireachtas in Dublin, Republic of Ireland A study of 342 US protests covered by The New York Times newspaper from 1962 to 1990 showed that such public activities usually affected the company's publicly traded stock price. The most intriguing aspect of the study's findings revealed that the amount of media coverage the event received was of the most importance to this study. Stock prices fell an average of one-tenth of a percent for every paragraph printed about the event.

The band consists of Geoff Rickly (lead vocals), Tom Keeley (lead guitar, backing vocals), Steve Pedulla (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Tim Payne (bass guitar), Andrew Everding (keyboards, backing vocals), and Tucker Rule (drums). Thursday released their debut album, Waiting, in late 1999 with original guitarist Bill Henderson, who left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Steve Pedulla. The band gained popularity with the release of their second album, Full Collapse, in 2001, and released their third album and major label debut, War All the Time, in 2003, which reached number seven on the US Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. Thursday released their fourth album, A City by the Light Divided, in 2006, and two further albums, Common Existence and No Devoluci√≥n, before announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2011. In a January 2013 interview, Geoff Rickly confirmed that the band had actually disbanded. However, the band announced a reunion in 2016. In October 2018, the band announced their reunion would conclude with a performance at Saint Vitus in Brooklyn, New York on March 17, 2019; however, Thursday had played more shows by the end of 2019, and will return in September 2021 for a performance at Riot Fest in Chicago. The band has been considered an influential band of the post-hardcore music scene in the 2000s, and is credited as one of the key bands to popularize the darker emo sound and screaming vocals which came to prominence at the time. History =Formation and Waiting (1997‚Äì2000)= Thursday was formed in 1997 by vocalist Geoff Rickly, guitarist Tom Keeley, guitarist Bill Henderson, bassist Tim Payne, and drummer Tucker Rule. The band began playing basement shows in New Brunswick and the surrounding New Jersey and New York areas, playing their first official show on December 31, 1998 in Rickly's basement alongside Midtown, Saves the Day and Poison the Well. The band recorded demos to hand out at shows, and in the summer of 1999, teamed up with MP3.com for their first official release, the 1999 Summer Tour EP, which featured demos of songs that would soon be found on their debut album, Waiting. The album was released on December 6, 1999 on northern New Jersey- based Eyeball Records without any singles or support from television or radio. =Full Collapse (2001‚Äì2002)= In 2001, Thursday signed to independent label Victory Records. After signing, they were warned by their friends that they \\"gotten ourselves into a situation that we would regret\\". The group were unsure what they meant, but thought things would turn out fine due to their contract with the label. They initially thought that part of the contract meant they could sign with a different label would they want to. However, they realized the deal had in fact stated they could only leave Victory if it was to join a major label, which they thought was \\"a far-fetched idea to say the least.\\" Later in the year, they released their second album Full Collapse through the label, eventually reaching number 178 on the Billboard 200. Before appearing on Warped Tour, the group visited Victory's offices and learned about Thursday-branded whoopee cushions that the label was planning to sell at the tour. Vocalist Geoff Rickly discussed this matter with Victory founder Tony Brummel, and according to the band, responded that Victory \\"was a big company and that they didn't have time to run everything by the band.\\" On a number of occasions, the group attempted to have better communication with the label in regards to promotion. On one occasion, Brummel informed them they were not living up to his expectations. Sometime afterwards, the group were touring with Saves the Day. Brummel became more positive in his interactions, frequently calling the band \\"just to say hello, or to ask how record sales at shows were going.\\" The group were disappointed that his positivity \\"wasn't there from the beginning. ... Instead of Tony's relationship with us being based on a love for music, it was based entirely on numbers.\\" The band's new- found popularity and disgust with the label led to internal problems, which almost led the band to disband. The situation caused the creation of the Five Stories Falling EP, a release the band used to fulfill contractual obligations with Victory Records. At live shows, the band routinely told fans not to purchase the EP, but instead to download \\"Jet Black New Year\\", the only new studio recording found on the EP, with the rest consisting of live performances of four Full Collapse songs. While all the interactions with the label were occurring, the group were being contacted by major labels. The group, who \\"didn't understand [anything] about major labels\\", pondered about other independent labels they would join. However, due to their contract they wouldn't be allowed to move to another independent label. Throughout 2001, people from major label Island Records had been to the band's shows since they became a full-time touring act. Soon after, the label expressed interest in signing the band. =War All the Time (2003‚Äì2005)= In late May 2002, the group announced they had signed to Island Records, following a bidding war between other major labels. Up to this point, Full Collapse had sold 111,000 copies. On September 9, the group's signing to Island Records was made official following negotiations of an exit agreement with Victory Records. The agreement required parent company Island/Def Jam to buy out Victory's contract claim for the group's next two albums. Rickly said as a result of the deal, Victory Records received $1,200,000, which meant the band would be \\"[paying off] that bill for as long as we were on the new label.\\" In addition, their next two albums were required to feature the Victory logo. With expectation building for their follow-up album, Rickly wanted their next album to be \\"really aggressive and progressive ... and have all these boundary pushing ideas\\". In September and October, the group went on the Plea for Peace Tour, and were planning to work on their next album following its conclusion. They said they had accumulated a lot of ideas but were unable to work on them due to touring. In mid-November, the group began writing new material. After an entire writing and recording process that took only six months, the band issued their third album and major label debut, War All the Time, on September 16, 2003 to critical acclaim and strong commercial performance. War All the Time was the first release to feature Andrew Everding on keyboards, though he would not become an official member of the band until December 2004, when he was officially welcomed into the band at a Christmas holiday show held at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. The album's title, coupled with it being released approximately two years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led many critics to believe it was a political album; however, Rickly has denied this on many accounts, instead claiming that he is speaking about love being a war. The album spawned two singles: \\"Signals Over the Air\\" and \\"War All the Time\\", though the latter received considerably less attention due to MTV banning the video for controversial material involving a fake news feed that appeared to be real and teenagers being weapon targets. Thursday toured extensively to support War All the Time, featuring dates with acts such as AFI, Thrice, and Coheed and Cambria. On these tours, Thursday performed many in-store acoustic sessions at various Tower Records stores and other record stores. The band also recorded a live acoustic session for Y100 Sonic Sessions, a radio program on the now defunct Philadelphia-based radio station, Y100. The live acoustic version of single \\"Signals Over the Air\\" was used on Y100 Sonic Sessions Volume 8. The band released two EPs: the first was Live from the SoHo & Santa Monica Stores Split EP and sold exclusively on iTunes, and the second was a promotion found in Revolver, called the Live in Detroit EP. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2004, citing label pressure, extensive touring, and health problems as the reasons. However, Thursday returned for a charitable performance to save New York City's CBGB, on August 25, 2005, which was streamed live through the CBGB's website. =A City by the Light Divided and Envy split release (2006‚Äì2008)= In fall 2005, five Thursday demo songs were stolen from the iPod of the tour manager for My American Heart, a band Rickly had recently collaborated with for their song \\"We Are the Fabrication\\". The band issued a statement on their official website stating that they were disappointed the unfinished products leaked, but that they were glad that people take that much interest in their music. The band confirmed the title of one demo, \\"At This Velocity\\" and promised it would make their upcoming album. Three other songs (\\"The Other Side of the Crash/Over and Out (Of Control)\\", \\"Telegraph Avenue Kiss\\", and \\"Autumn Leaves Revisited\\") would also make the album, while the remaining demo would later become the song \\"Last Call\\" on their fifth studio album, Common Existence. Thursday had originally toyed with the idea of a double album to follow up War All the Time but the idea was scrapped, reporting on their website that they believed \\"not even The Beatles could properly fill two discs with enough worthy material\\". Thursday released their fourth album and second major label release, A City by the Light Divided, on May 2, 2006, on Island Records in the US and Hassle Records in the United Kingdom. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann, becoming Thursday's first full-length album not produced by Sal Villanueva. The title was created by Geoff Rickly by combining two lines from the poem Sunstone by Octavio Paz. The album was available for preview on the band's MySpace page on April 18, 2006, two weeks before it was officially released. A City by the Light Divided was generally received well by critics, spawning two singles: \\"Counting 5-4-3-2-1\\" and \\"At This Velocity\\", though the latter received considerably less attention. The band left Island Records in early 2007. At their 2007 New Year's Eve show at the Starland Ballroom, the band announced that they will be writing and recording new material in 2008. During a private show they performed on May 3, 2007 in New York City, long- time friend and artist manager, David \\"Rev\\" Ciancio proposed to his fiancee on stage. Thursday also held a performance on May 5 at The Bamboozle under the fake name Bearfort. Thursday cancelled all tour plans until their fall tour with Circle Takes the Square and Portugal. The Man in support of Kill the House Lights, a DVD/CD compilation album and live album. featuring demos, unreleased songs, footage of live performances, and a documentary about the band. The album was released on October 30, 2007 by their former label Victory Records. Thursday announced on April 2, 2008, via a MySpace bulletin and their official website, a new split album with Japanese post-hardcore band Envy. The band debuted a song from the album live during their show in Poughkeepsie on April 24, 2008, and the album, Thursday / Envy, was released on Temporary Residence Limited on November 4, 2008. =Common Existence (2009‚Äì2010)= The band announced on September 30, 2008 that they had signed with Epitaph Records, regarding their new label the band stated: \\"It's a great feeling to have a label encourage you to be more socially conscious and politically active.\\" \\"Thursday sign to Epitaph.\\" punknews.org. September 30, 2008. Thursday released their fifth full-length album,Common Existence, on February 17, 2009 on Epitaph Records. In a March 2009 interview, Rickly explained the album's title refers to humanity's shared experience, and that many of the songs were influenced by the words of his favorite poets and authors: \\"Almost every song on the record is connected to a different writer. The first song, \\"Resuscitation of a Dead Man\\" is influenced by Denis Johnson's Resuscitation of a Hanged Man. Another song is based on a book [ Martin Amis'] Time's Arrow. The whole record also has a lot of themes from Roberto Bolano, a poet who wrote The Savage Detectives and a few other things. The song \\"Circuits of Fever\\" is very influenced by [writer] David Foster Wallace.\\" Cormac McCarthy has also influenced Rickly. Thursday headlined the 2009 Taste of Chaos Tour with support from Bring Me the Horizon, Four Year Strong, Pierce The Veil, Cancer Bats and a local act. The band was not well received on this tour, as the majority of the audience members showed up at tour dates mainly for opening act Bring Me the Horizon, with guitarist Tom Keeley approximating about 90% of the audience would leave before their set, and described the tour as an \\"awful experience.\\" =No Devoluci√≥n and disbandment (2011‚Äì2015)= Thursday began recording their next album in July 2010, at Tarbox Road Studios in Fredonia, New York with Dave Fridmann, who had also produced the group's two previous albums. Their sixth album and second release for Epitaph Records, No Devoluci√≥n, was released on April 12, 2011. Vocalist Geoff Rickly commented on the style of the new album, stating, \\"In style, this record feels like a radical departure from our earlier records but in substance it feels like a return. The songs are more vulnerable than they've been in a long time. [...] It's very atmospheric and mood oriented so far.\\" Rickly also stated that the primary lyrical theme is devotion. Thursday debuted \\"Turnpike Divides\\" at their annual holiday show on December 30, 2010 at the Starland Ballroom. On November 22, 2011, Thursday posted a statement on their official website and their Twitter account reading \\"Thanks & Love\\", expressing their intention to stop producing music together. However, the statement about the status of band was ambiguous, not stating explicitly in the article whether they were breaking up or on an indefinite hiatus. The following is excerpted from the article: In January 2013, Geoff Rickly stated during an interview that Thursday had in fact disbanded, and that the term \\"hiatus\\" was misleading as it had only been used in case the band did ever decided to play a show again. He did, however, indicate that there was a possibility for the band to play shows in the future, but no new material would ever be produced. Since their disbandment, Rickly formed the band No Devotion in 2014 with former members of the band Lostprophets, and has continued his side-project United Nations. Tucker Rule became the touring drummer for the British Boy Band The Wanted, the pop-punk band Yellowcard and works as a hired musician as well as studio drummer. =Reunion and second breakup (2016‚Äì2019)= In January 2016, former members of Thursday posted a picture of themselves hanging out to Rickly's Twitter account. This sparked rumors that the band would soon be reuniting, however Rickly quickly dispelled these rumors saying that their communication was minimal in the five years since disbanding and they were \\"just finally mending some fences and healing some old wounds.\\" Thursday's former booking agent began encouraging them to reunite the band with the freedom to do whatever they wanted and without the pressure of having to write a new album. Two months later, Thursday announced they would reunite for Atlanta, Georgia's Wrecking Ball music festival in August 2016. In a statement about the reunion show, Rickly said: \\"Five years ago, we found it necessary to end Thursday for reasons beyond our control. Earlier this year, we were able to reconcile all of our differences and spend time together. This is a vital component to what we loved about being in Thursday and we're happy to say that we'll be playing this show as the same line-up that began touring together on Full Collapse and jointly worked on every record since.\\" Thursday agreed to perform at Wrecking Ball only two days before publicly announcing their participation, and the decision was made after its organizers allowed the band to perform \\"in our own way, including involving a charity\\" and after hearing about the strong lineup of bands on the festival. The band had no intention to reunite before this decision. Two months later, it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of Riot Fest in September, causing speculation that the band may play more shows later on in the year. On June 15, the band's official Instagram posted a picture of a show bill announcing a 'homecoming' on December 30 at Starland Ballroom. The caption on the Instagram post read, \\"NJ-you won't believe the homecoming we have planned. The lineup and SETLIST are going to be insane.\\" On November 6, the band played the inaugural Sound on Sound fest just outside of Austin, TX. On January 31, 2017, the band announced a 24 date tour to take place in March and April 2017. Aside from the tour, Thursday headlined the 2017 Northside Festival in Brooklyn, New York. The band announced in October 2018 that they would be ending their reunion the following year while stating \\"when we stopped playing last time, it wasn‚Äôt on the best of terms. This time, we get to put down touring on the very highest of notes: in each other‚Äôs lives and able to pick up and play together behind closed doors whenever we want. If we are ever able to do Thursday again, it will be a new, separate chapter. Thank you all for your time, attention and friendship.\\". The band's final show took place on March 17, 2019 at Saint Vitus in Brooklyn, NY. In May 2019, due to mounting pressure from their international fanbase, who did not get an opportunity to see the reunion tour, the band announced that they would play Germany and released the following statement: \\"We are so excited and surprised to be able to announce Family First Festival in Cologne. After our last show, we began conversations about all the places that we hadn't been able to play on our reunion. It seemed impossible that we would all be available at the same time to play shows again, especially in any sustained way. But when our old friends in boysetsfire asked us to play this festival with them, we saw that we had a rare opportunity to accomplish two things at once: visit a country that's always been kind to Thursday and play, once more, with a band that we've admired since before we were a band, a band that took us on one of our first tours ever. After much discussion among ourselves, we decided that there were certain cities around the globe that we had unfinished business in and if we find that, at some point in the future, we‚Äôre in a position to play them, then we will. We hope to see you there.\\" They then proceeded to announce a show in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, and two UK shows to be held at London's Electric Ballroom, due to play Full Collapse on night one followed by War All the Time on night two, which took place in December 2019. Following this they appeared at The Shrine in Los Angeles on December 20, opening for the reunited My Chemical Romance. =Second return (2020‚Äìpresent)= Despite the band's previous statement that their reunion would come to an end, it was announced in June 2020 that Thursday will play their first show in nearly two years at Riot Fest in September 2021. It's not presently clear if the Riot Fest appearance will be a one-off, or if the band is reuniting on a more permanent basis. Logo The Thursday dove logo Thursday used a dove logo which featured on much of the band's artwork and merchandise. The dove is believed to have been conceived by guitarist Tom Keeley on a tour bus sometime before Full Collapse was recorded. Lyrics from the song \\"Cross Out the Eyes\\" on the album reference a dove twice, but it is unknown if these lyrics were inspired by the dove art or vice versa. The logo debuted on the cover art for War All the Time in 2003, appearing on the artwork for all of Thursday's album and single artwork until 2011, where it was notably absent on the cover art for their sixth and final album No Devoluci√≥n. The band also used a second logo, a red bullseye with a small chevron below it. This logo first appeared on the cover art for A City by the Light Divided in 2006, and featured on merchandise related to the album. It can also be seen faded in the background of the cover for Kill the House Lights. Additionally, Shepard Fairey (Creator of Obey) created artwork for the band with a new dove logo, which has been used on other works by Fairey.

Most of the methods involve throwing an axe into the ground, or swinging it into a tree, and interpreting the direction of the handle or the quivering of the blade. A form of this is axiomancy, this is when the quivering of the blade of an axe that has been thrust into a wooden table is interpreted by the diviner. Another interesting method is heating an axe-head in a fire until it glows, and then interpreting the colors and shapes. A variant, attributed to the ancient Greeks, who held it in good repute, is to balance a spherical piece of agate on the edge of the axe (held sharp edge up). The direction in which the agate rolls can be interpreted as needed. Some sources claim that Psalm 74 refers to the use of axinomancy to predict the fall of Jerusalem, although in the text the reference to upright axes is not specifically for divination.

Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, generated and excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere.  Description  This global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon is named after physicist Winfried Otto Schumann who predicted it mathematically in 1952. Schumann resonances occur because the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a closed waveguide. The limited dimensions of the Earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves in the ELF band. The cavity is naturally excited by electric currents in lightning. Schumann resonances are the principal background in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz through 60 Hz, and appear as distinct peaks at extremely low frequencies (ELF) around 7.83 Hz (fundamental), Department of Theoretical and Experimental Nuclear Physics, Odessa National Polytechnic University, Ukraine 14.3, 20.8, 27.3 and 33.8 Hz. In the normal mode descriptions of Schumann resonances, the fundamental mode is a standing wave in the Earth‚Äìionosphere cavity with a wavelength equal to the circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a frequency of approximately 4.11 Hz, but this frequency can vary slightly from a variety of factors, such as solar-induced perturbations to the ionosphere, which compresses the upper wall of the closed cavity. The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5 Hz intervals, a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere's spherical geometry. The peaks exhibit a spectral width of approximately 20% on account of the damping of the respective modes in the dissipative cavity. The 8th partial lies at approximately 60 Hz. Observations of Schumann resonances have been used to track global lightning activity. Owing to the connection between lightning activity and the Earth's climate it has been suggested that they may also be used to monitor global temperature variations and variations of water vapor in the upper troposphere. It has been speculated that extraterrestrial lightning (on other planets) may also be detected and studied by means of their Schumann resonance signatures. Schumann resonances have been used to study the lower ionosphere on Earth and it has been suggested as one way to explore the lower ionosphere on celestial bodies. Effects on Schumann resonances have been reported following geomagnetic and ionospheric disturbances. More recently, discrete Schumann resonance excitations have been linked to transient luminous events ‚Äì sprites, ELVES, jets, and other upper- atmospheric lightning. A new field of interest using Schumann resonances is related to short-term earthquake prediction. Interest in Schumann resonances was renewed in 1993 when E. R. Williams showed a correlation between the resonance frequency and tropical air temperatures, suggesting the resonance could be used to monitor global warming. In geophysical survey, Schumann resonances are used to locate offshore hydrocarbon deposits.  History  In 1893, George Francis FitzGerald noted that the upper layers of the atmosphere must be fairly good conductors. Assuming that the height of these layers is about 100 km above ground, he estimated that oscillations (in this case the lowest mode of the Schumann resonances) would have a period of 0.1 second. Because of this contribution, it has been suggested to rename these resonances \\"Schumann‚ÄìFitzGerald resonances\\". However FitzGerald's findings were not widely known as they were only presented at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, followed by a brief mention in a column in Nature. Hence first suggestion that an ionosphere existed, capable of trapping electromagnetic waves, is attributed to Heaviside and Kennelly (1902). It took another twenty years before Edward Appleton and Barnett in 1925 were able to prove experimentally the existence of the ionosphere. Although some of the most important mathematical tools for dealing with spherical waveguides were developed by G. N. Watson in 1918, it was Winfried Otto Schumann who first studied the theoretical aspects of the global resonances of the earth‚Äìionosphere waveguide system, known today as the Schumann resonances. In 1952‚Äì1954 Schumann, together with H. L. K√∂nig, attempted to measure the resonant frequencies. However, it was not until measurements made by Balser and Wagner in 1960‚Äì1963 that adequate analysis techniques were available to extract the resonance information from the background noise. Since then there has been an increasing interest in Schumann resonances in a wide variety of fields.  Basic theory  Lightning discharges are considered to be the primary natural source of Schumann resonance excitation; lightning channels behave like huge antennas that radiate electromagnetic energy at frequencies below about 100 kHz. These signals are very weak at large distances from the lightning source, but the Earth‚Äìionosphere waveguide behaves like a resonator at ELF frequencies and amplifies the spectral signals from lightning at the resonance frequencies. In an ideal cavity, the resonant frequency of the n-th mode f_{n} is determined by the Earth radius a and the speed of light c. :f_{n} =\\\\frac{c}{2 \\\\pi a}\\\\sqrt{n(n+1)} The real Earth‚Äìionosphere waveguide is not a perfect electromagnetic resonant cavity. Losses due to finite ionosphere electrical conductivity lower the propagation speed of electromagnetic signals in the cavity, resulting in a resonance frequency that is lower than would be expected in an ideal case, and the observed peaks are wide. In addition, there are a number of horizontal asymmetries ‚Äì day-night difference in the height of the ionosphere, latitudinal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, sudden ionospheric disturbances, polar cap absorption, variation in the Earth radius of ¬± 11 km from equator to geographic poles, etc. that produce other effects in the Schumann resonance power spectra.  Measurements  Today Schumann resonances are recorded at many separate research stations around the world. The sensors used to measure Schumann resonances typically consist of two horizontal magnetic inductive coils for measuring the north-south and east- west components of the magnetic field, and a vertical electric dipole antenna for measuring the vertical component of the electric field. A typical passband of the instruments is 3‚Äì100 Hz. The Schumann resonance electric field amplitude (~300 microvolts per meter) is much smaller than the static fair- weather electric field (~150 V/m) in the atmosphere. Similarly, the amplitude of the Schumann resonance magnetic field (~1 picotesla) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth's magnetic field (~30‚Äì50 microteslas). Specialized receivers and antennas are needed to detect and record Schumann resonances. The electric component is commonly measured with a ball antenna, suggested by Ogawa et al., in 1966, connected to a high-impedance amplifier. The magnetic induction coils typically consist of tens- to hundreds-of- thousands of turns of wire wound around a core of very high magnetic permeability. = Dependence on global lightning activity = From the very beginning of Schumann resonance studies, it was known that they could be used to monitor global lightning activity. At any given time there are about 2000 thunderstorms around the globe. Producing approximately fifty lightning events per second, these thunderstorms are directly linked to the background Schumann resonance signal. Determining the spatial lightning distribution from Schumann resonance records is a complex problem: in order to estimate the lightning intensity from Schumann resonance records it is necessary to account for both the distance to lightning sources and the wave propagation between the source and the observer. A common approach is to make a preliminary assumption on the spatial lightning distribution, based on the known properties of lightning climatology. An alternative approach is placing the receiver at the North or South Pole, which remain approximately equidistant from the main thunderstorm centers during the day. One method not requiring preliminary assumptions on the lightning distribution is based on the decomposition of the average background Schumann resonance spectra, utilizing ratios between the average electric and magnetic spectra and between their linear combination. This technique assumes the cavity is spherically symmetric and therefore does not include known cavity asymmetries that are believed to affect the resonance and propagation properties of electromagnetic waves in the system.  Diurnal variations  The best documented and the most debated features of the Schumann resonance phenomenon are the diurnal variations of the background Schumann resonance power spectrum. A characteristic Schumann resonance diurnal record reflects the properties of both global lightning activity and the state of the Earth‚Äìionosphere cavity between the source region and the observer. The vertical electric field is independent of the direction of the source relative to the observer, and is therefore a measure of global lightning. The diurnal behavior of the vertical electric field shows three distinct maxima, associated with the three \\"hot spots\\" of planetary lightning activity: one at 9 UT (Universal Time) linked to the daily peak of thunderstorm activity from Southeast Asia; one at 14 UT linked to the peak of African lightning activity; and one at 20 UT linked to the peak of South American lightning activity. The time and amplitude of the peaks vary throughout the year, linked to seasonal changes in lightning activity. = \\"Chimney\\" ranking = In general, the African peak is the strongest, reflecting the major contribution of the African \\"chimney\\" to global lightning activity. The ranking of the two other peaks‚ÄîAsian and American‚Äîis the subject of a vigorous dispute among Schumann resonance scientists. Schumann resonance observations made from Europe show a greater contribution from Asia than from South America, while observations made from North America indicate the dominant contribution comes from South America. Williams and S√°tori suggest that in order to obtain \\"correct\\" Asia- America chimney ranking, it is necessary to remove the influence of the day/night variations in the ionospheric conductivity (day-night asymmetry influence) from the Schumann resonance records. The \\"corrected\\" records presented in the work by S√°tori, et al. show that even after the removal of the day-night asymmetry influence from Schumann resonance records, the Asian contribution remains greater than American. Similar results were obtained by Pechony et al. who calculated Schumann resonance fields from satellite lightning data. It was assumed that the distribution of lightning in the satellite maps was a good proxy for Schumann excitations sources, even though satellite observations predominantly measure in-cloud lightning rather than the cloud-to-ground lightning that are the primary exciters of the resonances. Both simulations‚Äîthose neglecting the day-night asymmetry, and those taking this asymmetry into account‚Äîshowed the same Asia-America chimney ranking. On the other hand, some optical satellite and climatological lightning data suggest the South American thunderstorm center is stronger than the Asian center. The reason for the disparity among rankings of Asian and American chimneys in Schumann resonance records remains unclear, and is the subject of further research. = Influence of the day-night asymmetry = In the early literature the observed diurnal variations of Schumann resonance power were explained by the variations in the source-receiver (lightning-observer) geometry. It was concluded that no particular systematic variations of the ionosphere (which serves as the upper waveguide boundary) are needed to explain these variations. Subsequent theoretical studies supported the early estimations of the small influence of the ionosphere day-night asymmetry (difference between day-side and night-side ionosphere conductivity) on the observed variations in Schumann resonance field intensities. The interest in the influence of the day-night asymmetry in the ionosphere conductivity on Schumann resonances gained new strength in the 1990s, after publication of a work by Sentman and Fraser. Sentman and Fraser developed a technique to separate the global and the local contributions to the observed field power variations using records obtained simultaneously at two stations that were widely separated in longitude. They interpreted the diurnal variations observed at each station in terms of a combination of a diurnally varying global excitation modulated by the local ionosphere height. Their work, which combined both observations and energy conservation arguments, convinced many scientists of the importance of the ionospheric day-night asymmetry and inspired numerous experimental studies. However, recently it was shown that results obtained by Sentman and Fraser can be approximately simulated with a uniform model (without taking into account ionosphere day-night variation) and therefore cannot be uniquely interpreted solely in terms of ionosphere height variation. Schumann resonance amplitude records show significant diurnal and seasonal variations which in general coincide in time with the times of the day-night transition (the terminator). This time-matching seems to support the suggestion of a significant influence of the day-night ionosphere asymmetry on Schumann resonance amplitudes. There are records showing almost clock-like accuracy of the diurnal amplitude changes. On the other hand, there are numerous days when Schumann resonance amplitudes do not increase at sunrise or do not decrease at sunset. There are studies showing that the general behavior of Schumann resonance amplitude records can be recreated from diurnal and seasonal thunderstorm migration, without invoking ionospheric variations. Two recent independent theoretical studies have shown that the variations in Schumann resonance power related to the day-night transition are much smaller than those associated with the peaks of the global lightning activity, and therefore the global lightning activity plays a more important role in the variation of the Schumann resonance power. It is generally acknowledged that source-observer effects are the dominant source of the observed diurnal variations, but there remains considerable controversy about the degree to which day-night signatures are present in the data. Part of this controversy stems from the fact that the Schumann resonance parameters extractable from observations provide only a limited amount of information about the coupled lightning source-ionospheric system geometry. The problem of inverting observations to simultaneously infer both the lightning source function and ionospheric structure is therefore extremely underdetermined, leading to the possibility of non-unique interpretations.  \\"Inverse problem\\"  One of the interesting problems in Schumann resonances studies is determining the lightning source characteristics (the \\"inverse problem\\"). Temporally resolving each individual flash is impossible because the mean rate of excitation by lightning, ~50 lightning events per second globally, mixes up the individual contributions together. However, occasionally extremely large lightning flashes occur which produce distinctive signatures that stand out from the background signals. Called \\"Q-bursts\\", they are produced by intense lightning strikes that transfer large amounts of charge from clouds to the ground and often carry high peak current. Q-bursts can exceed the amplitude of the background signal level by a factor of 10 or more and appear with intervals of ~10 s, which allows them to be considered as isolated events and determine the source lightning location. The source location is determined with either multi-station or single-station techniques and requires assuming a model for the Earth‚Äìionosphere cavity. The multi-station techniques are more accurate, but require more complicated and expensive facilities. = Transient luminous events research = It is now believed that many of the Schumann resonances transients (Q bursts) are related to the transient luminous events (TLEs). In 1995, Boccippio et al. showed that sprites, the most common TLE, are produced by positive cloud-to-ground lightning occurring in the stratiform region of a thunderstorm system, and are accompanied by Q-burst in the Schumann resonances band. Recent observations reveal that occurrences of sprites and Q bursts are highly correlated and Schumann resonances data can possibly be used to estimate the global occurrence rate of sprites.  Global temperature  Williams [1992] suggested that global temperature may be monitored with the Schumann resonances. The link between Schumann resonance and temperature is lightning flash rate, which increases nonlinearly with temperature. The nonlinearity of the lightning-to-temperature relation provides a natural amplifier of the temperature changes and makes Schumann resonance a sensitive \\"thermometer\\". Moreover, the ice particles that are believed to participate in the electrification processes which result in a lightning discharge have an important role in the radiative feedback effects that influence the atmosphere temperature. Schumann resonances may therefore help us to understand these feedback effects. A paper was published in 2006 linking Schumann resonance to global surface temperature, which was followed up with a 2009 study.  Upper tropospheric water vapor  Tropospheric water vapor is a key element of the Earth's climate, which has direct effects as a greenhouse gas, as well as indirect effects through interaction with clouds, aerosols and tropospheric chemistry. Upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV) has a much greater impact on the greenhouse effect than water vapor in the lower atmosphere, but whether this impact is a positive or a negative feedback is still uncertain. The main challenge in addressing this question is the difficulty in monitoring UTWV globally over long timescales. Continental deep-convective thunderstorms produce most of the lightning discharges on Earth. In addition, they transport large amount of water vapor into the upper troposphere, dominating the variations of global UTWV. Price [2000] suggested that changes in the UTWV can be derived from records of Schumann resonances.  On other planets and moons  The existence of Schumann-like resonances is conditioned primarily by two factors: # A closed, planetary-sized and approximately spherical cavity, consisting of conducting lower and upper boundaries separated by an insulating medium. For the earth the conducting lower boundary is its surface, and the upper boundary is the ionosphere. Other planets may have similar electrical conductivity geometry, so it is speculated that they should possess similar resonant behavior. # A source of electrical excitation of electromagnetic waves in the ELF range. Within the Solar System there are five candidates for Schumann resonance detection besides the Earth: Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's biggest moon Titan. Modeling Schumann resonances on the planets and moons of the Solar System is complicated by the lack of knowledge of the waveguide parameters. No in situ capability exists today to validate the results. = Venus = The strongest evidence for lightning on Venus comes from the impulsive electromagnetic waves detected by Venera 11 and 12 landers. Theoretical calculations of the Schumann resonances at Venus were reported by Nickolaenko and Rabinowicz [1982] and Pechony and Price [2004]. Both studies yielded very close results, indicating that Schumann resonances should be easily detectable on that planet given a lightning source of excitation and a suitably located sensor. = Mars = In the case of Mars there have been terrestrial observations of radio emission spectra that have been associated with Schumann resonances. The reported radio emissions are not of the primary electromagnetic Schumann modes, but rather of secondary modulations of the nonthermal microwave emissions from the planet at approximately the expected Schumann frequencies, and have not been independently confirmed to be associated with lightning activity on Mars. There is the possibility that future lander missions could carry in situ instrumentation to perform the necessary measurements. Theoretical studies are primarily directed to parameterizing the problem for future planetary explorers. Detection of lightning activity on Mars has been reported by Ruf et al. [2009]. The evidence is indirect and in the form of modulations of the nonthermal microwave spectrum at approximately the expected Schumann resonance frequencies. It has not been independently confirmed that these are associated with electrical discharges on Mars. In the event confirmation is made by direct, in situ observations, it would verify the suggestion of the possibility of charge separation and lightning strokes in the Martian dust storms made by Eden and Vonnegut [1973] and Renno et al. [2003]. Martian global resonances were modeled by Sukhorukov [1991], Pechony and Price [2004], and Molina-Cuberos et al. [2006]. The results of the three studies are somewhat different, but it seems that at least the first two Schumann resonance modes should be detectable. Evidence of the first three Schumann resonance modes is present in the spectra of radio emission from the lightning detected in Martian dust storms. = Titan = It was long ago suggested that lightning discharges may occur on Titan, but recent data from Cassini‚ÄìHuygens seems to indicate that there is no lightning activity on this largest satellite of Saturn. Due to the recent interest in Titan, associated with the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens mission, its ionosphere is perhaps the most thoroughly modeled today. Schumann resonances on Titan have received more attention than on any other celestial body, in works by Besser et al. [2002], Morente et al. [2003], Molina-Cuberos et al. [2004], Nickolaenko et al. [2003], and Pechony and Price [2004]. It appears that only the first Schumann resonance mode might be detectable on Titan. Since the landing of the Huygens probe on Titan's surface in January 2005, there have been many reports on observations and theory of an atypical Schumann resonance on Titan. After several tens of fly-bys by Cassini, neither lightning nor thunderstorms were detected in Titan's atmosphere. Scientists therefore proposed another source of electrical excitation: induction of ionospheric currents by Saturn's co-rotating magnetosphere. All data and theoretical models comply with a Schumann resonance, the second eigenmode of which was observed by the Huygens probe. The most important result of this is the proof of existence of a buried liquid water-ammonia ocean under a few tens of km of the icy subsurface crust. = Jupiter and Saturn = Lightning activity has been optically detected on Jupiter. Existence of lightning activity on that planet was predicted by Bar- Nun [1975] and it is now supported by data from Galileo, Voyagers 1 and 2, Pioneers 10 and 11, and Cassini. Saturn is also confirmed to have lightning activity. Though three visiting spacecraft (Pioneer 11 in 1979, Voyager 1 in 1980, and Voyager 2 in 1981) failed to provide any convincing evidence from optical observations, in July 2012 the Cassini spacecraft detected visible lightning flashes, and electromagnetic sensors aboard the spacecraft detected signatures that are characteristic of lightning. Little is known about the electrical parameters of the interior of Jupiter or Saturn. Even the question of what should serve as the lower waveguide boundary is a non-trivial one in case of the gaseous planets. There seem to be no works dedicated to Schumann resonances on Saturn. To date there has been only one attempt to model Schumann resonances on Jupiter. Here, the electrical conductivity profile within the gaseous atmosphere of Jupiter was calculated using methods similar to those used to model stellar interiors, and it was pointed out that the same methods could be easily extended to the other gas giants Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Given the intense lightning activity at Jupiter, the Schumann resonances should be easily detectable with a sensor suitably positioned within the planetary-ionospheric cavity.

The word is mentioned by a number of Ancient Greek writers, including Philippides, Julius Pollux, Lucianus and, most famously, Theocritus. One method of practising coscinomancy is described by Cornelius Agrippa, best known for his Three Books of Occult Philosophy, 1533. Following the disputed Fourth Book in the same series, a work entitled the Heptameron, or Magical Elements appeared in the first volume of Agrippa's Opera omnia, or Collected Works (circa 1600). The first of two appendices to the Heptameron (chapter xxi) briefly covers many forms of ceremonial magic, including coscinomancy. Agrippa believed that the movement of the sieve was performed by a demon, and that the conjuration actually compelled the demon to perform the task. He further notes that the words of this conjuration were understood neither by the speaker nor anyone else (). The notion of a powerfully efficacious language of the spirit world is quite common in magic belief. The so-called Enochian language of the 16th century magician Edward Kelley, later revived by Aleister Crowley, is such a language. Kelley believed the Enochian words so powerful that he would communicate them to his cohort, Dr. John Dee, backwards, lest he unleash powers beyond control. This concept can also be seen in The Arabian Nights in which a sorceress takes some lake water in her hand and over it speaks \\"words not to be understood\\".Richard Francis Burton, The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night (Kama Shastra Society, 1885) I. xi. p.80 There has been some speculation about the manner in which the sieve was to be held by the shears, with some writers suggesting that a piece of thread was used. In the 1567 edition of Agrippa's works there is a picture showing exactly this. It is clear that the sieve was suspended from the shears in such a way that the cutting edges of the blades made tangents to the outer rim of the sieve. Thus suspended the sieve is capable of some sideways movement, or even of dropping. The sieve was held by the two middle fingers only making it almost impossible to keep the sieve still for any length of time and thus ensuring a prognostication. The complicating factor is that in the Latin text accompanying the picture the sieve is said to \\"turn around\\" (circum agatur), which clearly it cannot do unless held at two diametrically opposite points on the outer rim. Other references to coscinomancy can be found in Fran√ßois Rabelais' Pantagruel (1532: III. xxv.); Johann Weyer's De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Venificiis (1583: xii.); and Barten Holyday's Technogamia, or the Marriage of the Arts (1618: II. iii. ll. 89-146 (G2v)).

Some were cleared to make way for other buildings while others were destroyed by earthquakes and fire. For example, the wooden over the moat were replaced with stone and iron bridges. The buildings of the Imperial Palace constructed in the Meiji era were constructed of wood. Their design employed traditional Japanese architecture in their exterior appearance while the interiors were an eclectic mixture of then- fashionable Japanese and European elements. The ceilings of the grand chambers were coffered with Japanese elements; however, Western chairs, tables and heavy curtains furnished the spaces. The floors of the public rooms had parquets or carpets while the residential spaces used traditional tatami mats. The main audience hall was the central part of the palace. It was the largest building in the compound. Guests were received there for public events. The floor space was more than 223 tsubo or approximately . In the interior, the coffered ceiling was traditional Japanese-style, while the floor was parquetry. The roof was styled similarly to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, but was covered with (fireproof) copper plates rather than Japanese cypress shingles. In the late Taish≈ç and early Sh≈çwa period, more concrete buildings were added, such as the headquarters of the Imperial Household Ministry and the Privy Council. These structures exhibited only token Japanese elements. From 1888 to 1948, the compound was called . On the night of 25 May 1945, most structures of the Imperial Palace were destroyed in the Allied firebombing raid on Tokyo.

The modern designed for various imperial court functions and receptions is located in the old Nishinomaru section of the palace grounds. On a much more modest scale, the , the official residence of the Emperor and empress, is located in the Fukiage Garden. Designed by Japanese architect Sh≈çz≈ç Uchii the modern residence was completed in 1993. This residence is currently (July 2020) not in use and being prepared for Naruhito, who for the time being keeps his primary residence at the former T≈çg≈´ Palace, renamed while he resides there. Except for the Imperial Household Agency and the East Gardens, the main grounds of the palace are generally closed to the public, except for reserved guided tours from Tuesdays to Saturdays (which access only the Ky≈´den Totei Plaza in front of the Chowaden). Each New Year (January 2) and Emperor's Birthday, the public is permitted to enter through the Nakamon (inner gate) where they gather in the Ky≈´den Totei Plaza. The Imperial Family appears on the balcony before the crowd and the Emperor normally gives a short speech greeting and thanking the visitors and wishing them good health and blessings. Parts of the Fukiage garden are sometimes open to the general public. The old Honmaru, Ninomaru, and Sannomaru compounds now comprise the East Gardens, an area with public access containing administrative and other public buildings. The Kitanomaru Park is located to the north and is the former northern enceinte of Edo Castle. It is a public park and is the site of the Nippon Budokan. To the south is Kokyo Gaien National Garden.

The main buildings of the palace grounds, including the main palace, home of the liaison conference of the Imperial General Headquarters, were severely damaged by the fire of May 1945. Today's palace consists of multiple modern structures that are interconnected. The palace complex was finished in 1968 and was constructed of steel-framed reinforced concrete structures produced domestically, with two stories above ground and one story below. The buildings of the Imperial Palace were constructed by the Takenaka Corporation in a modernist style with clear Japanese architectural references such as the large, gabled hipped roof, columns and beams. The complex consists of six wings, including: * Seiden State Function Hall * H≈çmeiden State Banquet Hall * Ch≈çwaden Reception Hall * Rensui Dining Room * Chigusa Chidori Drawing Room and * The Emperor's work office Halls include the Minami-Damari, Nami-no-Ma, multiple corridors, Kita- Damari, Shakky≈ç-no-Ma, Shunju-no-Ma, Seiden-Sugitoe (Kaede), Seiden-Sugitoe (Sakura), Take-no-Ma, Ume-no-Ma and Matsu-no-Ma. Famous Nihonga artists such as Maeda Seison were commissioned to paint the artworks. The Ky≈´den is used for both receiving state guests and holding official state ceremonies and functions. The Matsu-no-Ma (Pine Chamber) is the throne room. The Emperor gives audiences to the Prime Minister in this room, as well as appointing or dismissing ambassadors and Ministers of State. It is also the room where the Prime Minister and Chief Justice is appointed to office.

Located on the grounds of the East Gardens is the Imperial Tokagakudo Music Hall, the Music Department of the Board of Ceremonies of the Imperial Household, the Archives and Mausolea Department Imperial Household Agency, structures for the guards such as the Saineikan dojo, and the Museum of the Imperial Collections. Several structures that were added since the Meiji period were removed over time to allow construction of the East Garden. In 1932, the kuretake-ry≈ç was built as a dormitory for imperial princesses, however this building was removed prior to the construction of the present gardens. Other buildings such as stables and housing were removed to create the East Garden in its present configuration. Construction work began in 1961 with a new pond in the Ninomaru, as well as the repair and restoration of various keeps and structures from the Edo period.

Do seeds contain trees or do trees contain seeds? We could say both are true, because 'trees and seeds' is an example of a holon. A holon (Greek: ·ΩÖŒªŒøŒΩ, holon neuter form of ·ΩÖŒªŒøœÇ, holos \\"whole\\") is something that is simultaneously a whole and a part. The word was used by Arthur Koestler in his book The Ghost in the Machine (1967, p. 48) and the phrase to h√≥lon is a Greek word preceding the Latin analogue universum, in the sense of totality, a whole. Koestler was influenced by two observations in proposing the notion of the holon. The first observation was influenced by Herbert A. Simon's parable of the two watchmakers‚Äîin which Simon concludes that complex systems evolve from simple systems much more rapidly when there are stable intermediate forms present in the evolutionary process than if they are not present.Simon, Herbert A. (1969). The Sciences of the Artificial. Boston: MIT Press. The second observation was made by Koestler himself in his analysis of hierarchies and stable intermediate forms in non-living matter (atomic and molecular structure), living organisms, and social organizations. He concluded that, although it is easy to identify sub-wholes or parts, wholes and parts in an absolute sense do not exist anywhere. Koestler proposed the word holon to describe the hybrid nature of sub-wholes and parts within in vivo systems. From this perspective, holons exist simultaneously as self-contained wholes in relation to their sub-ordinate parts, and as dependent parts when considered from the inverse direction. Koestler also says that holons are self-reliant units that possess a degree of independence and can handle contingencies without asking higher authorities for instructions. I.e. they have a degree of autonomy. These holons are also simultaneously subject to control from one or more of these higher authorities. The first property ensures that holons are stable forms that are able to withstand disturbances, while the latter property signifies that they are intermediate forms, providing a context for the proper functionality for the larger whole. Finally, Koestler defines a holarchy as a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function first as autonomous wholes in supra-ordination to their parts, secondly as dependent parts in sub-ordination to controls on higher levels, and thirdly in coordination with their local environment. General definition A holon is a system (or phenomenon) that is an evolving self-organizing dissipative structure, composed of other holons, whose structures exist at a balance point between chaos and order. It is sometimes discussed in the context of self- organizing holarchic open systems (or, SOHO systems). For full details, see: A holon is maintained by the throughput of matter‚Äìenergy and information‚Äìentropy connected to other holons and is simultaneously a whole in itself and at the same time is nested within another holon and so is a part of something much larger than itself. Holons range in size from the smallest subatomic particles and strings, all the way up to the multiverse, comprising many universes. Individual humans, their societies and their cultures are intermediate level holons, created by the interaction of forces working upon us both top-down and bottom-up. On a non-physical level, words, ideas, sounds, emotions‚Äîeverything that can be identified‚Äîis simultaneously part of something, and can be viewed as having parts of its own, similar to sign in regard of semiotics. In 2013 Australian academic JT Velikovsky proposed the holon as the structure of the meme, the unit of culture, synthesizing the major theories on memes of Richard Dawkins, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, E. O. Wilson, Frederick Turner and Arthur Koestler. Defined in this way, holons are related to the concept of autopoiesis, especially as it was developed in the application of Stafford Beer to second-order cybernetics and the viable system model, but also Niklas Luhmann in his social systems theory. Since a holon is embedded in larger wholes, it is influenced by and influences these larger wholes. And since a holon also contains subsystems, or parts, it is similarly influenced by and influences these parts. Information flows bidirectionally between smaller and larger systems as well as rhizomatic contagion. When this bidirectionality of information flow and understanding of role is compromised, for whatever reason, the system begins to break down: wholes no longer recognize their dependence on their subsidiary parts, and parts no longer recognize the organizing authority of the wholes. Cancer may be understood as such a breakdown in the biological realm. A hierarchy of holons is called a holarchy. The holarchic model can be seen as an attempt to modify and modernise perceptions of natural hierarchy. Ken Wilber comments that the test of holon hierarchy (holarchy) is that if all instances of a given type of holon cease to exist, then all the holons they were part of must cease to exist too. Thus an atom is of a lower standing in the hierarchy than a molecule, because if you removed all molecules, atoms could still exist, whereas if you removed all atoms, molecules, in a strict sense would cease to exist. Wilber's concept is known as the doctrine of the fundamental and the significant. A hydrogen atom is more fundamental than an ant, but an ant is more significant. The doctrine of the fundamental and the significant is contrasted by the radical rhizome oriented pragmatics of Deleuze and Guattari, and other continental philosophy. A significant feature of Koestler's concept of holarchy is that it is open ended both in the macrocosmic as well as in the microcosmic dimensions. This aspect of his theory has several important implications. For example, if we take string theory to be legitimate, the holarchic system does not begin with strings or end with the multiverse. Those are just the present limits of the reach of the human mind in the two dimensions. Humans will cross those limits eventually, because they do not encompass the whole of reality. Karl Popper (Objective Knowledge, 1972) teaches that what the human mind knows and can ever know of truth at a given point of time and space is verisimilitude‚Äîsomething like truth‚Äîand that the human mind will continue to get closer to reality but never reach it. In other words, the human quest for knowledge is an unending journey with innumerable grand sights ahead but with no possibility of reaching the journey's end. The work of modern physicists designed to discover the theory of everything (TOE) is reaching deep into the microcosm under the assumption that the macrocosm is eventually made of the microcosm. This approach falls short on two counts: the first is that the fundamental is not the same as significant and the second is that this approach does not take into account that the microcosmic dimension is open ended. It follows that the search for TOE will discover phenomena more microcosmic than strings or the more comprehensive M theory. It is also the case that many laws of nature that apply to systems relatively low in the hierarchy cease to apply at higher levels. M theory might have predictive power at the sub-atomic level but it will inform but little about reality at higher levels. The work of the particle physicists is indeed laudable but possibly they should give the theory they are looking for another name. This is not to claim that the concept of holarchy is already the theory of everything. Types =Individual holon= An individual holon possesses a dominant monad; that is, it possesses a definable \\"I-ness\\". An individual holon is discrete, self- contained, and also demonstrates the quality of agency, or self-directed behavior.Wilber, K. (2007). The integral vision. Shambhala Publications: Boston The individual holon, although a discrete and self-contained whole, is made up of parts; in the case of a human, examples of these parts would include the heart, lungs, liver, brain, spleen, etc. When a human exercises agency, taking a step to the left, for example, the entire holon, including the constituent parts, moves together as one unit. =Social holon= A social holon does not possess a dominant monad; it possesses only a definable \\"we- ness\\", as it is a collective made up of individual holons.Luhmann, N. (1995). Social systems. Stanford University Press: California In addition, rather than possessing discrete agency, a social holon possesses what is defined as nexus agency. An illustration of nexus agency is best described by a flock of geese. Each goose is an individual holon, the flock makes up a social holon. Although the flock moves as one unit when flying, and it is \\"directed\\" by the choices of the lead goose, the flock itself is not mandated to follow that lead goose. Another way to consider this would be collective activity that has the potential for independent internal activity at any given moment. =Artifacts= American philosopher Ken Wilber includes Artifacts in his theory of holons. Artifacts are anything (e.g. a statue or a piece of music) that is created by either an individual holon or a social holon. While lacking any of the defining structural characteristics - agency; self-maintenance; I-ness; Self Transcendence - of the previous two holons, Artifacts are useful to include in a comprehensive scheme due to their potential to replicate aspects of and profoundly affect (via, say interpretation) the previously described holons. Artifacts are made up of individual or social holons (e.g. a statue is made up of atoms). The development of Artificial Intelligence may force one to question where the line should be drawn between the individual holon and the artifact. =Heaps= Heaps are defined as random collections of holons that lack any sort of organisational significance. A pile of leaves would be an example of a heap. Note, one could question whether a pile of leaves could be an \\"artifact\\" of an ecosystem \\"social holon\\". This raises a problem of intentionality: in short, if social holons create artifacts but lack intentionality (the domain of individual holons), how can we distinguish between heaps and artifacts? Further, if an artist (individual holon) paints a picture (artifact) in a deliberately chaotic and unstructured way does it become a heap?  In multiagent systems  Multiagent systems are systems composed of autonomous software entities. They are able to simulate a system or solve problems. A holon, just like an agent, is an intelligent entity able to interact with the environment and to make decisions to solve a specific problem. A Holon has the noteworthy property of playing the role of a whole and a part at the same time. This reflects at the organizational level: Holarchy functions first as autonomous wholes in supra-ordination to their parts, secondly as dependent parts in sub-ordination to controls on higher levels, and thirdly in coordination with their local environment. The SARL agent-oriented programming language is a language with native support for the concept of holon. The associated run-time environment Janus enables running the implemented holons.

Chinese beer has also seen a rise in popularity internationally in the last few decades. While most Chinese beers are pale lagers, other styles are occasionally found, such as Tsingtao Dark Beer. History Production and consumption of beer in China has occurred for around nine thousand years, with recent archaeological findings showing that Chinese villagers were brewing beer-type alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scales. Made with rice, honey, grape, and hawthorn fruits, this early beer seems to have been produced similarly to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Ancient Chinese beer was important in ancestral worship, funeral and other rituals of Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the beer was called as Lao Li (ÈÜ™ÈÜ¥ in oracle bone script). However, after the Han Dynasty, Chinese beer faded from prominence in favor of huangjiu, which remained the case for the next two millennia. Modern beer brewing was not introduced into China until the end of 19th century, when Polish people established a brewery in Harbin, with another three following (also in Harbin), set up by Germans, Czechoslovaks and Poles respectively. Japanese also established in 1934 in Mukden Manchurian Beer, which later became Shenyang Snow Beer and then acquired in 1994 by China Resources Enterprises.Visiting Shenyang Snow Beer's Old Brewery (in Chinese) Emergence of Craft Beer in China The emergence of craft beer in China started in the large metro areas including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

However, Chinese government regulations have been cited as an obstacle facing new breweries or those wishing to expand bottling distribution. Brewing ingredients Chinese beers often contain rice, sorghum and sometimes rye in addition to barley. Some beer is produced that uses bitter melon instead of hops as the bittering agent. Chinese media reported in 2001 that as many as 95% of all Chinese beers contained formaldehyde, to prevent sedimentation in bottles and cans while in storage. This practice has now been made illegal. Economy Despite being a country where more than one in three Chinese people are estimated to genetically have Asian flush syndrome, China is deemed the world's largest beer market in terms of global consumption, followed by the United States and Brazil. Snow Beer, produced by CR Snow is the best selling beer in China, holding 21.7% market share, having recently overtaken Tsingtao Beer, produced by Tsingtao Brewery, which is the brand most widely exported to other countries. Tsingtao Beer is brewed in the city of Qingdao (formerly spelled Tsingtao in EFEO Chinese transcription) which was a German base in the time of unequal treaties and late-colonial western influence in China. The Germans needed beer for their sailors, soldiers and traders, and production continued after they lost the city to the Japanese in World War I. Apart from Tsingtao, other major Chinese brewing groups include China Pabst Blue Ribbon, Yanjing, Sie-Tang Lio and Zhujiang Beer. Many major international brewers now have interests in, or joint ventures with, Chinese breweries, and popular international brands such as Carlsberg are now produced in China. This gives them access to the Chinese market while providing capital and expertise to help upgrade local brewing standards, albeit at the cost of variety. Brewpubs are gaining popularity in China, primarily in major cities which have a resident western community, though there are a few exceptions in more remote locations like Bad Monkey Brewery in Dali Old Town, Yunnan. The oldest craft brewery in Shanghai is Henry's (which is now closed), followed by The Bund Brewery. Shanghai Brewery, Boxing Cat Brewery, The BREW and Dr. Beer are some of the more prominent craft breweries in Shanghai. In Beijing, several craft breweries such as Great Leap Brewing, Jing-A Brewing, Panda Brew Pub, and Slow Boat Brewery have become staples in the local nightlife scene. Another popular brewpub is Kaiwei Beer House, a chain based in Wuhan. Craft beer festivals have been popularized since the early 2010s in Beijing and Shanghai. Two popular beer festivals in Shanghai, Shanghai International Beer Festival and Shanghai Beer Week, were both started in 2012. In 2015 market share of imported beer reached 1.14% and volume increased by 58.9% to 538.5 million litres. List of major Chinese beers Note: This is a partial list of China's major breweries.

Non-Alcoholic Beer Market in China There is a growing consumer inclination towards less strong beer in China as health conscious millennials are seeking wholesome and lower caloric options in their choice of beer, and consumers who want low alcohol and healthier drinks are noted to be mainly young women. According to a study by market intelligence agency Mintel, China has the highest amount of product launches of low or zero alcohol beer (below 3.5 percent ABV) in the Asia Pacific region in 2016, and over one in four (29 percent) beers launched in China in that year, were of low or non alcoholic beers. Qingdao Beers launched the first non-alcoholic beer in China in 2012 with its product, 'Qingdao 0.00', that is brewed from Czech hops and Australian barley. Jonny Forsyth, a global drinks analyst of Mintel firm, stated \\"..(the) research indicates that Chinese consumers, in general, prefer less strong beer in terms of ABV, compared to the global market\\". Consumers in china tend to gravitate towards tried and trusted brands for their purchases in low or non alcoholic beers, with big companies like Heineken and Qingdao enjoying massive support from consumers based on sales and annual profits.

Stephen Pile ranked her \\"the world's worst opera singer... No one, before or since, has succeeded in liberating themselves quite so completely from the shackles of musical notation.\\" Because of her technical incompetence, she became a prominent musical cult figure in New York City during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.

Foster said her lifelong passion for public performance began when she was seven years old.Collup, D: Florence Foster Jenkins: A World of Her Own. DVD, Video Artists Int'l (2007). A talented pianist, she performed at society functions as \\"Little Miss Foster\\",The Worst Singer in the World. psmag.com, retrieved August 11, 2016. and gave a recital at the White House during the administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes. After graduating from high school, her hopes of studying music in Europe were dashed when her father refused permission, and funding. In 1885, at the age of 17, Florence eloped with Frank Thornton Jenkins, a physician 16 years her senior, to Philadelphia, where they married. The following year, after learning that she had contracted syphilis from her husband, she ended their relationship and reportedly never spoke of him again. Years later, she claimed to have been granted a divorce decree on March 24, 1902, although no documentation of any such ruling has been found. She retained the Jenkins surname for the remainder of her life. After an arm injury ended her aspirations as a pianist, Jenkins gave piano lessons in Philadelphia to support herself; but around 1900 she moved with her mother to New York City. In 1909, in her early forties, Jenkins met a 33-year-old British actor named St. Clair Bayfield; they began a vaguely defined cohabitation relationship that continued the rest of her life.Peters, Brooks, \\"Florence, The Nightingale?,\\" June 15, 2006 (also appeared, but in slightly different format, in Opera News magazine) 65 (12): 20‚Äì23 Upon her father's death later that year, Jenkins became the beneficiary of a sizable trust, and resolved to resume her musical career as a singer, with Bayfield as her manager. She began taking voice lessons and immersed herself in wealthy New York City society, joining dozens of social clubs. As the \\"chairman of music\\" for many of these organizations, she began producing lavish tableaux vivants‚Äîpopular diversions in upper-crust social circles of that era. In each of these productions, Jenkins would invariably cast herself as the main character in the final tableau, wearing an elaborate costume of her own design. In a widely republished photograph, Jenkins poses in a costume, complete with angelic wings, from her tableau inspired by Howard Chandler Christy's painting Stephen Foster and the Angel of Inspiration. Jenkins began giving private vocal recitals in 1912 when she was 44 years old. In 1917, she became founder and \\"President Soprano Hostess\\" of her own social organization, the Verdi Club, dedicated to \\"fostering a love and patronage of Grand Opera in English\\". Its membership quickly swelled to over 400; honorary members included Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar. When Jenkins's mother died in 1930, additional financial resources became available for the expansion and promotion of her singing career.Foster family tree , wargs.com; accessed March 28, 2015. Vocal career According to published reviews and other contemporary accounts, Jenkins's acknowledged proficiency at the piano did not translate well to her singing. She is described as having great difficulty with such basic vocal skills as pitch, rhythm, and sustaining notes and phrases. In recordings, her accompanist Cosm√© McMoon can be heard making adjustments to compensate for her constant tempo variations and rhythmic mistakes,Piano ma non solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme Ed., 2012, pp. 140‚Äì41; . but there was little he could do to conceal her inaccurate intonation. She was consistently flat, sometimes considerably so. Her diction was similarly substandard, particularly with foreign-language lyrics. The difficult operatic arias that Jenkins chose to perform‚Äîall well beyond her technical ability and vocal range‚Äîserved only to emphasize these deficiencies. \\"There's no way to even pedagogically discuss it,\\" said vocal instructor Bill Schuman. \\"It's amazing that she's even attempting to sing that music.\\" The opera impresario Ira Siff, who dubbed her \\"the anti-Callas\\", said, \\"Jenkins was exquisitely bad, so bad that it added up to quite a good evening of theater... She would stray from the original music, and do insightful and instinctual things with her voice, but in a terribly distorted way. There was no end to the horribleness... They say Cole Porter had to bang his cane into his foot in order not to laugh out loud when she sang. She was that bad.\\" Nevertheless, Porter rarely missed a recital. The question of whether \\"Lady Florence\\"‚Äîas she liked to be called, and often signed her autographs‚Äîwas in on the joke, or honestly believed she had vocal talent, remains a matter of debate. On the one hand, she compared herself favorably with the renowned sopranos Frieda Hempel and Luisa Tetrazzini, and seemed oblivious to the abundant audience laughter during her performances. Her loyal friends endeavored to disguise the laughter with cheers and applause; they often described her technique to curious enquirers in \\"intentionally ambiguous\\" terms‚Äîfor example, \\"her singing at its finest suggests the untrammeled swoop of some great bird\\".Felton, Bruce (1980) \\"That's Entertainment? 6 Perfectly Wretched Performers\\", pp. 162‚Äì63, in The Book of Lists #2, edited by Irving Wallace, et al., London: Elm Tree Books, . Favorable articles and bland reviews, published in specialty music publications such as The Musical Courier, were most likely written by her friends, or herself. \\"I would say that she maybe didn't know [how badly she sang]\\", said mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. \\"We can't hear ourselves as others hear us.\\" Nerve damage due to syphilis and its treatment (see below) may have physically compromised her hearing as well. On the other hand, Jenkins refused to open her performances to the general public, and was clearly aware of her detractors. \\"People may say I can't sing,\\" she once remarked to a friend, \\"but no one can ever say I didn't sing.\\" She dismissed her original accompanist, Edwin McArthur, after catching him giving her audience \\"a knowing smile\\" during a performance. She went to great lengths to control access to her private recitals, which took place at her apartment, in small clubs, and each October at the Verdi Club's annual \\"Ball of the Silver Skylarks\\" in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel's Grand Ballroom. Attendance, by personal invitation only, was restricted to her loyal clubwomen and a select few others. Jenkins handled distribution of the coveted tickets herself, carefully excluding strangers, particularly music critics. \\"There's no way she could not have known\\", said Schuman. \\"No one is that unaware ... she loved the audience reaction and she loved singing. But she knew.\\"Huizenga, T. Killing Me Sharply With Her Song: The Improbable Story Of Florence Foster Jenkins . NPR.org (August 10, 2016), retrieved October 25, 2016. Despite her careful efforts to insulate her singing from public exposure, a preponderance of contemporaneous opinion favored the view that Jenkins's self-delusion was genuine. \\"At that time Frank Sinatra had started to sing, and the teenagers used to faint during his notes and scream\\", McMoon told an interviewer. \\"So she thought she was producing the same kind of an effect.\\" \\"Florence didn't think she was pulling anyone's leg\\", said opera historian Albert Innaurato. \\"She was compos mentis, not a lunatic. She was a very proper, complex individual.\\" As an anonymous obituary writer later put it, \\"Her ears, schooled in constant introversion, heard only the radiant tones which never issued forth to quell the mirth of her audiences.\\" Her recitals featured arias from the standard operatic repertoire by Mozart, Verdi, and Johann Strauss; lieder by Brahms; Valverde's Spanish waltz \\"Clavelitos\\" (\\"Little Carnations\\"); and songs composed by herself and McMoon. As in her tableaux, she complemented her performances with elaborate costumes of her own design, often involving wings, tinsel, and flowers. She would perform \\"Clavelitos\\" dressed as Carmen, complete with castanets and a wicker basket of flowers, clicking the castanets and tossing the flowers one by one. When she ran out of flowers, she flung the basket too‚Äîand then the castanets. Her fans, aware that \\"Clavelitos\\" was her favorite song, would usually demand an encore, prompting her to send McMoon into the audience to retrieve flowers, basket, and castanets so that she could sing the number again. thumb Once, when a taxi in which she was riding collided with another car, Jenkins let out a high- pitched scream. Upon arriving home, she went immediately to her piano and confirmed (at least to herself) that the note she had screamed was the fabled \\"F above high C\\"‚Äîa pitch she had never before been able to reach. Overjoyed, she refused to press charges against either involved party, and even sent the taxi driver a box of expensive cigars. McMoon said neither he \\"nor anyone else\\" ever heard her actually sing a high F, however. At the age of 76, Jenkins finally yielded to public demand and booked Carnegie Hall for a general-admission performance that took place on October 25, 1944. Tickets for the event sold out weeks in advance; the demand was such that an estimated 2,000 people were turned away at the door of the 2,800-seat venue.Getlen, Larry, \\"How the world's worst singer made a career as a musician\\" , New York Post, July 30, 2016, retrieved August 15, 2016. Numerous celebrities attended, including Porter, Marge Champion, Gian Carlo Menotti, Kitty Carlisle and Lily Pons with her husband, Andre Kostelanetz, who composed a song for the recital. McMoon later recalled an \\"especially noteworthy\\" moment: \\"[When she sang] 'If my silhouette does not convince you yet/My figure surely will' [from Adele's aria in Die Fledermaus], she put her hands righteously to her hips and went into a circular dance that was the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen. And created a pandemonium in the place. One famous actress had to be carried out of her box because she became so hysterical.\\" Since ticket distribution was out of Jenkins's control for the first time, mockers, scoffers, and critics could no longer be kept at bay. The following morning's newspapers were filled with scathing, sarcastic reviews that devastated Jenkins, according to Bayfield. \\"[Mrs. Jenkins] has a great voice\\", wrote the New York Sun critic. \\"In fact, she can sing everything except notes ... Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note was from its proper elevation the more the audience laughed and applauded.\\" The New York Post was even less charitable: \\"Lady Florence ... indulged last night in one of the weirdest mass jokes New York has ever seen.\\"Queen of the Night . NPR.org (August 1, 2014), retrieved August 15, 2016. Five days after the concert, Jenkins suffered a heart attack while shopping at G. Schirmer's music store, and died a month later on November 26, 1944, at her Manhattan residence, the Hotel Seymour. She was buried next to her father in the Foster mausoleum, Hollenback Cemetery, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. =Possible influence of ongoing medical problems= Some of Jenkins's performance difficulties have been attributed to untreated syphilis, which causes progressive deterioration of the central nervous system in its later stages.Jeremy Nicholas, \\"Review: Florence Foster Jenkins ‚Äì (A) World of Her Own\\" , Gramophone. Nerve damage and other morbidities caused by the disease may have been compounded by toxic side effects‚Äîsuch as hearing loss‚Äîfrom mercury and arsenic, the prevailing (and largely ineffective) syphilis remedies of the pre-antibiotic era. By the time penicillin became generally available in the 1940s, Jenkins' disease had progressed to the tertiary stage, which is unresponsive to antibiotics. Recordings =Audio= The only professional audio recordings of Jenkins consist of nine selections on five 78-rpm records (Melotone Recording Studio, New York City, 1941‚Äì1944), produced by Jenkins herself, at her own expense, and sold to her friends at $2.50 a copy. The selections include four coloratura arias from operas by Mozart, Delibes, Johann Strauss II, and F√©licien David, and five art songs, two written for Jenkins by her accompanist, Cosm√© McMoon. Seven of the selections were released by RCA Victor on a 10-inch LP in 1954, and reissued on a 12-inch LP in 1962, The Glory () of the Human Voice. *A-side #Mozart: \\"Queen of the Night aria\\", from The Magic Flute (in English) #Liadoff: \\"The Musical Snuff- Box\\" (English version by Adele Epstein) #McMoon: \\"Like a Bird\\" (words by Jenkins) #Delibes: \\"Bell Song\\", from Lakm√© (in French) #David: \\"Charmant oiseau\\" (with flute and piano), from La perle du Br√©sil (in French) #Bach/: \\"Biassy\\" (based on the prelude from Bach's Prelude and Fugue in G minor, BWV 861, words by Alexander Pushkin, in Russian) #Johann Strauss II: \\"Mein Herr Marquis\\" (Adele's Laughing Song) from Die Fledermaus (English version by Lorraine Noel Finley) *B-side from Gounod's Faust, Jenny Williams (soprano), Thomas Burns (piano) #\\"Valentine's Aria\\" (Ere I leave my native land) #\\"Jewel Song\\" (O heavenly jewels) #\\"Salut, demeure\\" (Emotions strange) #Final Trio (My heart is overcome with terror, sung as a duet) The material has since been reissued in various combinations on three CDs: * The Glory () of the Human Voice (Sony Classical/RCA Victor Gold Seal, , 1992), a reissue of the 1962 Victor recording with the song \\"Serenata Mexicana\\" by McMoon added. * Florence Foster Jenkins & Friends: Murder on the High Cs (Naxos Records, , 2003) contains all nine selections plus \\"Valse Caressante\\" by McMoon. * The Muse Surmounted: Florence Foster Jenkins and Eleven of Her Rivals (Homophone Records, , 2004) includes one Jenkins song, \\"Valse Caressante\\", plus a brief interview with McMoon. =Film= Jenkins commissioned filming of her performances at the Verdi Club's signature annual event, the \\"Ball of the Silver Skylarks\\", held each October at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.

It originated as the Minneapolis Tribune in 1867 and the competing Minneapolis Daily Star in 1920. During the 1930s and 1940s Minneapolis's competing newspapers were consolidated, with the Tribune published in the morning and the Star in the evening. They merged in 1982, creating the Star and Tribune, and it was renamed to Star Tribune in 1987. After a tumultuous period in which the newspaper was sold and re-sold and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, it was purchased by local businessman Glen Taylor in 2014. The Star Tribune serves Minneapolis and is distributed throughout the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area, the state of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest. It typically contains a mixture of national, international and local news, sports, business and lifestyle content. Journalists from the Star Tribune and its predecessor newspapers have won six Pulitzer Prizes, most recently winning two in 2013. The newspaper's headquarters is in downtown Minneapolis. Its distribution is ranked 7th in the United States. History =Minneapolis Tribune= The Star Tribune roots date to the creation of the Minneapolis Daily Tribune by Colonel William S. King, William D. Washburn, and Dorilus Morrison; the Tribune first issue was published on May 25, 1867. The newspaper went through several different editors and publishers during its first two decades, including John T. Gilman, George K. Shaw, Albert Shaw, and Alden J. Blethen. In 1878 the Minneapolis Evening Journal began publication, giving the Tribune its first competition. On November 30, 1889, the Tribune headquarters in downtown Minneapolis caught fire. Seven people were killed and 30 injured, and the building and presses were a total loss. In 1891, the Tribune was purchased by Gilbert A. Pierce and William J. Murphy for $450,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Pierce quickly sold his share to Thomas Lowry and Lowry sold it to Murphy, making Murphy the newspaper's sole owner. His business and legal background helped him structure the Tribune debt and modernize its printing equipment. The newspaper experimented with partial-color printing and the use of halftone for photographs and portraits. In 1893, Murphy sent the Tribune first correspondent to Washington, D.C. As Minneapolis grew, the newspaper's circulation expanded; the Tribune and the Evening Journal were closely competitive, with the smaller Minneapolis Times in third place. In 1905, Murphy bought out the Times and merged it with the Tribune. He died in 1918, endowing a school of journalism at the University of Minnesota. After a brief transitional period, Murphy's son Fred became the Tribune publisher in 1921. =Minneapolis Daily Star= The other half of the newspaper's history begins with the Minnesota Daily Star, which was founded on August 19, 1920, by elements of the agrarian Nonpartisan League and backed by Thomas Van Lear and Herbert Gaston. The Daily Star had difficulty attracting advertisers with its overt political agenda, and went bankrupt in 1924. After its purchase by A. B. Frizzell and former New York Times executive John Thompson, the newspaper became the politically independent Minneapolis Daily Star. =Cowles era= Star manager John Cowles, Sr. In 1935, the Cowles family of Des Moines, Iowa, purchased the Star. The family patriarch, Gardner Cowles, Sr., had purchased The Des Moines Register and the Des Moines Tribune during the first decade of the century and managed them successfully. Gardner's son, John Cowles, Sr. (1898‚Äì1983), moved to Minneapolis to manage the Star. Under him it had the city's highest circulation, pressuring Minneapolis's other newspapers. In 1939 the Cowles family purchased the Minneapolis Evening Journal, merging the two newspapers into the Star-Journal. Tribune publisher Fred Murphy died in 1940; the following year the Cowles family bought the Tribune and merged it with their company, giving it ownership of the city's major newspapers. The Tribune became the city's morning newspaper, the Star-Journal (renamed the Star in 1947) was the evening newspaper, and they published a joint Sunday edition. A separate evening newspaper (the Times) was spun off, which published until 1948. In 1944, John Cowles, Sr., hired Wisconsin native and former Tulsa Tribune editor William P. Steven as managing editor of the two newspapers; Steven became vice president and executive editor in 1954. During his tenure in Minneapolis, he was president of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association in 1949 and first chairman of the organization's Continuing Study Committee. By August 1960 John Cowles, Jr., was vice president and associate editor of the two papers, and it was soon apparent that he disapproved of Steven's hard-nosed approach to journalism. When Steven chafed under the younger Cowles's management, he was fired. After Steven's ouster, John Cowles, Jr., was editor of the two newspapers; he became president in 1968 and editorial chairman the following year. He had a progressive political viewpoint, publishing editorials supporting the civil rights movement and liberal causes. In 1982 the afternoon Star was discontinued due to dwindling circulation, a trend common for afternoon newspapers. The two papers were merged into a single morning paper, the Minneapolis Star and Tribune. Cowles, Jr., fired publisher Donald R. Dwight. His handling of Dwight's termination led to his removal as editor in 1983, although his family retained a controlling financial interest in the newspaper. In 1983, the Star and Tribune challenged a Minnesota tax on paper and ink before the Supreme Court of the United States. In Minneapolis Star Tribune Co. v. Commissioner, the court found that the tax (which targeted specific newspapers) was a violation of the First Amendment. In 1987 the newspaper's name was simplified to Star Tribune, and the slogan \\"Newspaper of the Twin Cities\\" was added. =1998 to present= In 1998 the McClatchy Company purchased Cowles Media Company for $1.4 billion (equivalent to $ in ), ending the newspaper's 61-year history in the family in one of the largest sales in American newspaper history. Although McClatchy sold many of Cowles's smaller assets, it kept the Star Tribune for several years. On December 26, 2006, McClatchy sold the paper to private equity firm Avista Capital Partners for $530 million (equivalent to $ in ), less than half of what it had paid for Cowles eight years earlier. In March 2007 Par Ridder was appointed Star Tribune publisher after his predecessor, J. Keith Moyer, left the newspaper after the sale. Ridder is a member of the Ridder family, which had owned Knight Ridder (publishers of several newspapers, including the rival St. Paul Pioneer Press). Ridder's arrival resulted in litigation when it was discovered that he had stolen a hard drive containing information about employees and advertisers which the Pioneer Press called \\"trade secrets\\". Ridder also took two high-ranking staff members with him to the Minneapolis paper, which raised eyebrows since such employees usually have non-compete clauses in their contracts. On September 18, 2007, Ridder was removed from his post by a Ramsey County judge, and he resigned on December 7. On January 15, 2009, the paper, the country's 15th-largest daily, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. On September 17 the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a bankruptcy plan for the Star Tribune, which emerged from bankruptcy protection on September 28. The paper's senior secured lenders received about 95 percent of the post-bankruptcy company. Since 2010, the Star Tribune has given out awards to the Top 150 Workplaces in Minnesota. Wayzata Investment Partners became majority owner of the Star Tribune Company in August 2012, with a 58 percent stake. In 2014, the company was acquired by Glen Taylor, owner of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves. Taylor, a former Republican state senator, said that the Star Tribune would be less liberal under his ownership. However, he said that the newspaper had already begun a shift and he would focus on accurately reporting both sides of all issues. In May 2015, the company acquired alternative weekly City Pages from Voice Media Group. Editions After the 1987 formation of the Star Tribune, the newspaper was published in three editions: one for Minneapolis and the western suburbs, one for St. Paul and the eastern suburbs and a state edition for Minnesota and the Midwest. The St. Paul edition was discontinued in 1999 in favor of a metro edition for the Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul area and a state edition for areas beyond the metropolitan area. Although the newspaper competes with the St. Paul-based Pioneer Press in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul area, the Star Tribune is more popular in the western metropolitan area and the Pioneer Press more popular in the eastern metro area. The newspapers share some printing and delivery operations. The Star Tribune went online in 1995, introducing the StarTribune.com website the following year. In 2011, the website erected a paywall. The online subscription management under the platform cannot be canceled online or via email, and can only be canceled by phone. Content The Star Tribune has five main sections: main news, local news, sports, business and variety (lifestyle and entertainment). Special weekly sections include Taste (restaurants and cooking), travel, Outdoors Weekend and Science + Health. The Sunday edition has a larger editorial and opinion section, Opinion Exchange. The Wednesday edition includes an extra section focusing on local news and issues, with separate versions for the northern, southern, northwestern and southwestern regions of the newspaper's circulation area.

After the Star Tribune bankruptcy its former ownership group, led by New York City-based Avista Capital Partners, has no stake in the company. Headquarters and printing plant Downtown East headquarters until 2015 After the city's newspapers were consolidated by the Cowles family, their offices were gradually moved to the former the Daily Star headquarters in downtown Minneapolis. The building was renovated in 1939‚Äì1940, and expanded in a larger renovation from 1946 to 1949. After 1949, the building housed the offices and presses of the Star and the Tribune. During the 1980s an annex, the Freeman Building, was built across the street from the headquarters and connected with a skyway. In 1987, the Star Tribune opened a new, $110 million (equivalent to $ in ) printing plant, called the Heritage Center, in a historic warehouse district on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. Its five offset presses took over the printing of all Star Tribune editions. News and business offices remained in the downtown headquarters, whose old presses were removed. In 2014, the company announced that it would relocate from the 95-year-old headquarters building to Capella Tower to make way for development around nearby U.S. Bank Stadium. Demolition of the buildings began in 2014, the last employees relocated in mid-2015, and the demolition completed later that year. Also in 2014, the Star Tribune's Heritage printing plant began printing the St. Paul Pioneer Press under a contract with its cross-town rival. The following year USA Today contracted with the Star Tribune to print regional copies of its daily edition at the Heritage plant. Printing plants owned by those newspaper companies in St. Paul and Maple Grove, Minn., shut down.

A trademark is said to become genericised when it begins as a distinctive product identifier but changes in meaning to become generic. This typically happens when the products or services with which the trademark is associated have acquired substantial market dominance or mind share, such that the primary meaning of the genericised trademark becomes the product or service itself rather than an indication of source for the product or service. A trademark thus popularised has its legal protection at risk in some countries such as the United States and United Kingdom, as its intellectual property rights in the trademark may be lost and competitors enabled to use the genericised trademark to describe their similar products, unless the owner of an affected trademark works sufficiently to correct and prevent such broad use. \\"Under some circumstances, terms that are not originally generic can become generic over time (a process called \\"genericity\\"), and thus become unprotected.\\"  In subpopulations  Genericization or \\"loss of secondary meaning\\" may be prevalent among either the general population or just a subpopulation, such as among people who work in a particular industry. Some examples of the latter type from the vocabulary of physicians include the names Luer-Lok (Luer lock), Phoroptor (phoropter), and Port-a-Cath (portacath), which have genericized mind share (among physicians) because no alternative generic name for the idea is widely used, and as a result, users may not realize that the term is a brand name rather than a medical eponym or generic-etymology term. Most often, genericization occurs because of heavy advertising that fails to provide an alternative generic name or that uses the trademark in similar fashion to generic terms. Thus, when the Otis Elevator Company advertised that it offered \\"the latest in elevator and escalator design,\\" it was using the well-known generic term \\"elevator\\" and Otis' trademark \\"Escalator\\" for moving staircases in the same way. The Trademark Office and the courts concluded that, if Otis used their trademark in that generic way, they could not stop Westinghouse from calling its moving staircases \\"escalators\\", and a valuable trademark was lost through genericization.  In pharmaceuticals  The pharmaceutical industry affords some protection from genericization of trade names with the modern practice of assigning a nonproprietary name for a drug based upon chemical structure. Brand-name drugs have well-known nonproprietary names from the beginning of their commercial existence, even while still under patent, preventing the aforementioned problem of \\"no alternative generic name for the idea readily coming to mind\\". For example, even when Abilify was new, its nonproprietary name, Aripiprazole, was well documented. Another example is Warfarin, which was known as an ingredient in rat poison before it was approved for human use under the brand name of Coumadin. Examples of genericization before the modern system of generic drugs include aspirin, introduced to the market in 1897, and heroin, introduced in 1898. Both were originally trademarks of Bayer AG. However, U.S. court rulings in 1918 and 1921 found the terms to be genericized, stating the company's failure to reinforce the brand's connection with their product as the reason. Bayer's involvement in the Great Phenol Plot during World War I, and subsequently the U.S. declaration of war on Germany, were also involved in the case of aspirin and heroin. A different sense of the word genericized in the pharmaceutical industry refers to products whose patent protection has expired. For example, Lipitor was genericized in the U.S. when the first competing generic version was approved by the FDA in November 2011. In this same context, the term genericization refers to the process of a brand drug losing market exclusivity to generics.  Trademark erosion  Trademark erosion, or genericization, is a special case of antonomasia related to trademarks. It happens when a trademark becomes so common that it starts being used as a common name and the original company has failed to prevent such use. Once it has become an appellative, the word cannot be registered any more; this is why companies try hard not to let their trademark become too common, a phenomenon that could otherwise be considered a successful move since it would mean that the company gained an exceptional recognition. Nintendo is an example of a brand that successfully fought trademark erosion, having managed to replace excessive use of its name by the then-neologism game console.  Legal concepts  Whether or not a mark is popularly identified as genericized, the owner of the mark may still be able to enforce the proprietary rights that attach to the use or registration of the mark, as long as the mark continues to exclusively identify the owner as the commercial origin of the applicable products or services. If the mark does not perform this essential function and it is no longer possible to legally enforce rights in relation to the mark, the mark may have become generic. In many legal systems (e.g., in the United States but not in Germany) a generic mark forms part of the public domain and can be commercially exploited by anyone. Nevertheless, there exists the possibility of a trademark becoming a revocable generic term in German (and European) trademark law. The process by which trademark rights are diminished or lost as a result of common use in the marketplace is known as genericization. This process typically occurs over a period of time in which a mark is not used as a trademark (i.e., where it is not used to exclusively identify the products or services of a particular business), where a mark falls into disuse entirely, or where the trademark owner does not enforce its rights through actions for passing off or trademark infringement. One risk factor that may lead to genericization is the use of a trademark as a verb, plural or possessive, unless the mark itself is possessive or plural (e.g., \\"Friendly's\\" restaurants). However, in highly inflected languages, a tradename may have to carry case endings in usage. An example is Finnish, where \\"Microsoftin\\" is the genitive case and \\"Facebookista\\" is the elative case. = Avoiding genericization = Generic use of a trademark presents an inherent risk to the effective enforcement of trademark rights and may ultimately lead to genericization. Trademark owners may take various steps to reduce the risk, including educating businesses and consumers on appropriate trademark use, avoiding use of their marks in a generic manner, and systematically and effectively enforcing their trademark rights. If a trademark is associated with a new invention, the trademark owner may also consider developing a generic term for the product to be used in descriptive contexts, to avoid inappropriate use of the \\"house\\" mark. Such a term is called a generic descriptor, and is frequently used immediately after the trademark to provide a description of the product or service. For example, \\"Kleenex tissues\\" (\\"facial tissues\\" being the generic descriptor) or \\"Velcro brand fasteners\\" for Velcro brand name hook-and-loop fasteners. Another common practice among trademark owners is to follow their trademark with the word brand to help define the word as a trademark. Johnson & Johnson changed the lyrics of their Band-Aid television commercial jingle from, \\"I am stuck on Band-Aids, 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me\\" to \\"I am stuck on Band-Aid brand, 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me.\\" Google has gone to lengths to prevent this process, discouraging publications from using the term 'googling' in reference to Web searches. In 2006, both the Oxford English Dictionary and the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary struck a balance between acknowledging widespread use of the verb coinage and preserving the particular search engine's association with the coinage, defining google (all lower case, with -le ending) as a verb meaning \\"use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\\". Where a trademark is used generically, a trademark owner may need to take aggressive measures to retain exclusive rights to the trademark. Xerox Corporation attempted to prevent the genericization of its core trademark through an extensive public relations campaign advising consumers to \\"photocopy\\" instead of \\"xerox\\" documents. One example of an active effort to prevent the genericization of a trademark was that of the Lego Company, which printed in manuals in the 1970s and 1980s a request to customers that they call the company's interlocking plastic building blocks \\"'Lego bricks', 'blocks' or 'toys', and not 'Legos'.\\" While this went largely unheeded, and many children and adults in the U.S. referred to and continue to refer to the pieces as \\"Legos\\", use of the deprecated term remained largely confined to the Lego Company's own products ‚Äì and not, for example, to Tyco's competing and interchangeable product ‚Äì so genericization of the Lego trademark did not occur. Adobe Systems is working to prevent the genericization of their trademarks, such as Photoshop, but has had mixed success. This is shown via recurring use of the adjective \\"photoshopped\\", or the shortened version \\"shopped\\", throughout the Internet and mass media.  Protected designation of origin  Since 2003, the European Union has actively sought to restrict the use of geographical indications by third parties outside the EU by enforcing laws regarding \\"protected designation of origin\\". Although a geographical indication for specialty food or drink may be generic, it is not a trademark because it does not serve to identify exclusively a specific commercial enterprise and therefore cannot constitute a genericized trademark. The extension of protection for geographical indications is somewhat controversial. A geographical indication may have been registered as a trademark elsewhere; for example, if \\"Parma Ham\\" was part of a trademark registered in Canada by a Canadian manufacturer, then ham manufacturers in Parma, Italy, might be unable to use this name in Canada. Wines (such as Bordeaux, Port and Champagne), cheeses (such as Roquefort, Parmesan, Gouda, and Feta), Pisco liquor, and Scotch whisky are examples of geographical indications. Compare Russian use of \\"–®–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ\\" (= Shampanskoye) for champagne-type wine made in Russia. In the 1990s, the Parma consortium successfully sued the Asda supermarket chain to prevent it using the description \\"Parma ham\\" on prosciutto produced in Parma but sliced outside the Parma region. The European Court ruled that pre-packaged ham must be produced, sliced, and packaged in Parma in order to be labeled for sale as \\"Parma ham\\".  Scale of distinctiveness  A trademark is said to fall somewhere along a scale from being \\"distinctive\\" to \\"generic\\" (used primarily as a common name for the product or service rather than an indication of source). Among distinctive trademarks the scale goes from strong to weak: ; \\"Arbitrary\\" : having no meaning as to the nature of the product ; \\"Fanciful\\" or \\"coined\\" : original and having little if any reference to the nature of the product or service ; \\"Suggestive\\" : having primarily trademark significance but with suggestion as to the nature of the product ; \\"Descriptive\\" : not just suggesting, but actually describing the product or service yet still understood as indicating source ; \\"Merely descriptive\\" : having almost entirely reference to the product or service but capable of becoming \\"distinctive\\".

Notice the prevalence of traditional Chinese characters as brand logos during that time, including Jianlibao (ÂÅ•ÂäõÂÆù), Rejoice (È£ÑÊüî) and Âπø‰∏ú‰∏áÂÆ∂‰πê, only Head & Shoulders (Êµ∑È£û‰∏ù) printed in simplified. In Mainland China, it is legal to design brand logos in traditional characters; yet, by 2020, apart from Jianlibao, the other three have changed to simplified. The character (Pinyin: ) meaning \\"complex, complicated (Chinese characters)\\" Traditional Chinese characters (, Pinyin: ) are Chinese characters in any character set which does not contain newly created characters, or character substitutions performed after 1946. Traditional Chinese characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as in most overseas Chinese communities outside Southeast Asia. In contrast, Simplified Chinese characters are used in Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore in official publications. The modern shapes of traditional Chinese characters first appeared with the emergence of the clerical script during the Han dynasty and have been more or less stable since the 5th century (during the Southern and Northern Dynasties). The retronym \\"Traditional Chinese\\" is used to contrast traditional characters with simplified Chinese characters, a standardized character set introduced in the 1950s by the government of the People's Republic of China on Mainland China. The debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters has been a long-running issue among Chinese communities. Currently, many overseas Chinese online newspapers allow users to switch between both character sets. Modern usage in Chinese- speaking areas =Mainland China= Although simplified characters are taught and endorsed by the government of China, there is no prohibition against using traditional characters. Traditional characters are used informally, primarily in handwriting, but also for inscriptions and religious text. They are often retained in logos or graphics to evoke yesteryear. Nonetheless, the vast majority of media and communications in China use simplified characters. =Hong Kong and Macau= In Hong Kong and Macau, Traditional Chinese has been the legal written form since colonial times. In recent years, simplified Chinese characters have started being used,by whom? to accommodate Mainland Chinese tourists and immigrants. This has led to residents being concerned about protecting their local heritage. =Taiwan= Taiwan has never adopted simplified characters. The use of simplified characters in official documents and educational settings is prohibited by the government of Taiwan. Simplified characters are mostly understood by any educated Taiwanese, and learning to read them takes little effort. Some stroke simplifications that have been incorporated into Simplified Chinese are in common use in handwriting. =Philippines= Job announcement in a Filipino Chinese daily newspaper written in Traditional Chinese characters The Chinese Filipino community continues to be one of the most conservative in Southeast Asia regarding simplification. Although major public universities teach simplified characters, many well-established Chinese schools still use traditional characters. Publications like the Chinese Commercial News, World News and United Daily News all use traditional characters. So do some magazines from Hong Kong, such as the Yazhou Zhoukan. On the other hand, the Philippine Chinese Daily uses simplified. DVD subtitles for film or television subtitles mostly use Traditional Characters. This is because the Chinese dub used in the Philippines is the same as the one used in Taiwan, because the DVDs belongs to DVD Region Code 3. =United States= Chinese emigrants in the United States have long used traditional characters. Many Chinese immigrated to the United States during the second half of the 19th century, before the standardization of simplified characters. Therefore, US public notices and signage in Chinese are generally in Traditional Chinese.See, for instance, https://www.irs.gov/irm/part22/irm_22-031-001.html (Internal Revenue Manual 22.31.1.6.3 ‚Äì \\"The standard language for translation is Traditional Chinese.\\" Chinese names Traditional Chinese characters (the standard characters) are called several different names within the Chinese-speaking world. The government of Taiwan officially calls traditional Chinese characters standard characters or orthodox characters (). However, the same term is used outside Taiwan to distinguish standard, simplified and traditional characters from variant and idiomatic characters.Academy of Social Sciences, (1978), Modern Chinese Dictionary, The Commercial Press: Beijing. In contrast, users of traditional characters outside Taiwan, such as those in Hong Kong, Macau and overseas Chinese communities, and also users of simplified Chinese characters, call them complex characters (). Users of simplified characters sometimes informally refer to them as \\"old characters\\" (). Users of traditional characters also sometimes call them \\"full Chinese characters\\" () to distinguish them from simplified Chinese characters. Some traditional character users argue that traditional characters are the original form of the Chinese characters and cannot be called \\"complex\\". Similarly, simplified characters cannot be \\"standard\\" because they are not used in all Chinese-speaking regions. Conversely, supporters of simplified Chinese characters object to the description of traditional characters as \\"standard,\\" since they view the new simplified characters as the contemporary standard used by the vast majority of Chinese speakers. They also point out that traditional characters are not truly traditional as many Chinese characters have been made more elaborate over time. Some people refer to traditional characters as simply \\"proper characters\\" () and modernized characters as \\"simplified-stroke characters\\" () or \\"reduced-stroke characters\\" () (simplified- and reduced- are actually homophones in Mandarin Chinese, both pronounced ji«én). Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters explores the differences of opinion that exist on this matter within Chinese- speaking regions. Printed text When printing text, people in mainland China and Singapore mainly use the simplified system, developed by the People's Republic of China government in the 1950s. In writing, most people use informal, sometimes personal simplifications. In most cases, an alternative character () will be used in place of one with more strokes, such as for . In the old days, there were two main uses of alternative characters. First, alternative characters were used to avoid using the characters of the formal name of an important person in less formal contexts as a way of showing respect to the said person by preserving the characters of the person's name. This act is called \\"offence-avoidance\\" () in Chinese. Secondly, alternative characters were used when the same characters were repeated in context to show that the repetition was intentional rather than an editorial mistake (). Computer encoding and fonts In the past, Traditional Chinese was most often rendered using the Big5 character encoding scheme, a scheme that favours Traditional Chinese. Unicode, however, has become increasingly popular as a rendering method. Unicode gives equal weight to both simplified and traditional Chinese characters. There are various IMEs (Input Method Editors) available to input Chinese characters. There are still many Unicode characters that cannot be written using most IMEs; one example would be the character used in the Shanghainese dialect instead of , which is U+20C8E ( with a radical). In font filenames and descriptions, the acronym TC is used to signify the use of traditional Chinese characters to differentiate fonts that use SC for Simplified Chinese characters. Web pages The World Wide Web Consortium recommends the use of the language tag as a language attribute value and Content-Language value to specify web-page content in Traditional Chinese. Usage in other languages In Japanese, ky≈´jitai is the now- obsolete, non-simplified form of simplified Shinjitai J≈çy≈ç kanji; as with Korean, these non-simplified characters are mostly congruent with the traditional characters in Chinese, save for a few minor regional graphical differences. Furthermore, characters that are not included in the J≈çy≈ç list are generally recommended to be printed in their original non-simplified forms, save for a few exceptions. In most cases, traditional Chinese characters are identical with Hanja in Korean (now almost completely replaced by Hangul for general use, but nonetheless unchanged from Chinese except for some Korean-made Hanja).

(June 1, 1637 ‚Äì May 18, 1675), sometimes known as P√®re Marquette or James Marquette,Melody, John. \\"Archdiocese of Chicago\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 23 February 2012 was a French-Canadian Jesuit missionary who founded Michigan's first European settlement, Sault Ste. Marie, and later founded St. Ignace, Michigan. In 1673, Marquette, with Louis Jolliet, an explorer born near Quebec City, was the first European to explore and map the northern portion of the Mississippi River Valley. Early life Jacques Marquette was born in Laon, France, on June 1, 1637. He came of an ancient family distinguished for its civic and military services. Marquette joined the Society of Jesus at age 17. He studied and taught in France for several years, then the Jesuits assigned him to New France in 1666 as a missionary to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. When he arrived Quebec, he was assigned to Trois-Rivi√®res on the Saint Lawrence River, where he assisted Gabriel Druillettes and, as preliminary to further work, devoted himself to the study of the local languages and became fluent in six different dialects.Spalding, Henry. \\"Jacques Marquette, S.J.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 15 February 2019 Explorations In 1668, Marquette was moved by his superiors to missions farther up the Saint Lawrence River in the western Great Lakes region. That year he helped Druillettes found the mission at Sault Ste. Marie in present-day Michigan.Monet, J., ‚ÄúMarquette, Jacques\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003 Other missions were founded at St. Ignace in 1671 (St. Ignace Mission) and at La Pointe on Lake Superior in present-day Wisconsin. At La Pointe, he encountered members of the Illinois tribes, who told him about the important trading route of the Mississippi River. They invited him to teach their people, whose settlements were mostly farther south. Because of wars between the Hurons at La Pointe and the neighboring Lakota people, Marquette left the mission and went to the Straits of Mackinac; he informed his superiors about the rumored river and requested permission to explore it. Lamprecht (1838‚Äì1906), at Marquette UniversityThe painting was rendered as an engraving on a US commemorative postage stamp, 1898 (Illustration) Leave was granted, and in 1673 Marquette joined the expedition of Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian explorer. They departed from St. Ignace on May 17, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry. They sailed to Green Bay and up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters. From there, they were told to portage their canoes a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak plains to the Wisconsin River. Many years later, at that point the town of Portage, Wisconsin was built, named for the ancient path between the two rivers. From the portage, they ventured forth, and on June 17 they entered the Mississippi near present- day Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. Map of the discovery made in the year 1673 in North America The Joliet-Marquette expedition traveled to within of the Gulf of Mexico but turned back at the mouth of the Arkansas River. By this point they had encountered several natives carrying European trinkets, and they feared an encounter with explorers or colonists from Spain.Catton, Bruce (1984). Michigan: A History, p. 14. W. W. Norton & Company. They followed the Mississippi back to the mouth of the Illinois River, which they learned from local natives provided a shorter route back to the Great Lakes. They reached Lake Michigan near the site of modern-day Chicago, by way of the Chicago Portage. In September, Marquette stopped at the mission of St. Francis Xavier, located in present-day Green Bay, Wisconsin, while Jolliet returned to Quebec to relate the news of their discoveries.Campbell, T.J., \\"James Marquette\\", Pioneer priests of North America, 1642-1710, Vol. 3, Fordham University Press, 1910 Grave of Marquette, St. Ignace, Michigan. Marquette and his party returned to the Illinois territory in late 1674, becoming the first Europeans to winter in what would become the city of Chicago. As welcomed guests of the Illinois Confederation, the explorers were feasted en route and fed ceremonial foods such as sagamite. Death In the spring of 1675, Marquette traveled westward and celebrated a public mass at the Grand Village of the Illinois near Starved Rock. A bout of dysentery which he had contracted during the Mississippi expedition sapped his health. On the return trip to St. Ignace, he died at age 37 near the modern town of Ludington, Michigan. A Michigan Historical Marker at this location reads: The Ojibway Museum on State Street in downtown St. Ignace is in a building that was constructed adjacent to Marquette's gravesite during urban development.

He entered the Diplomatic Corps of the Holy See on 1941 serving for five years in the Vatican Secretariat of State and later, as Apostolic Internuncio to Indonesia (1958), In 1961 he received episcopal consecration as titular Archbishop of Binda by Fernando Cardinal Cento upon his appointment as Nuncio of Chile (1961), followed quickly by similar appointments in Lebanon (1963), and Ireland (1969) where he retired in 1989. As Apostolic Nuncio to Chile he led the Chilean delegation to the Second Vatican Council. Nuncio to Ireland He was appointed Papal Nuncio to Ireland on 19 April 1969, shortly after the outbreak of the Troubles. This was a challenging time for the Church in Ireland then led by Cardinal William Conway as it adjusted to both the internal changes generated by the Second Vatican Council and the wider social changes. Alibrandi was ill-suited to coping with these changes and in particular the violence in Northern Ireland. It is widely assumed that he saw to it that the more overtly nationalist Tomas O'Fiaich was appointed to Armagh in 1977 after the death of Cardinal Conway. The journalist and author Ed Moloney in his book on the IRA asserts that Alibrandi's \\"sympathy for the IRA was a constant source of friction with the government in London.\\" In many of the episcopal appointments made while Alibrandi was nuncio he favoured doctrinally 'sound', right of centre priests and in the case of the Archdiocese of Dublin picked two priests Kevin McNamara and Desmond Connell who were notably ill-suited. In a profile of the Archbishop at the time of his retirement T.P. O'Mahony observed in The Tablet \\"although he rarely gave interviews, and never overtly intervened in policy- making or in public controversies, it is beyond dispute that Archbishop Alibrandi wielded considerable influence behind the scenes.\\" The respected academic and church historian Dermot Keogh assessing this period argues that \\"there was a general view that the best candidates had not been appointed...that a number were not up to the job, that most of the appointees shared a defensive attitude to matters of church and state. He had ‚Äúa very testy relationship with three Taoisigh ‚Äì Jack Lynch, Liam Cosgrave and Garret FitzGerald‚Äù.Nuncio quit Dublin role after bank accounts questioned It was reported in September 2012 during the second Dr Garret FitzGerald Memorial Lecture at University College Cork by Se√°n Donlon, former secretary general at the Department of Foreign Affairs, that \\"It came to our [Department of Foreign Affairs] attention that a substantial amount in three bank accounts in Dublin [held by the archbishop] were way in excess of what was needed to run the nunciature. The source [of the money] appeared to be South America.\\" Donlon went on to say \\"Because of its size, we thought it appropriate to ask if the funds belonged to the Holy See.\\" When contacted for an answer, Dr Alibrandi \\"quickly answered ‚Äòno‚Äô and that they belonged to ‚Äòfamily‚Äô. When it was pointed out to him that the money was then liable under Irish taxation law to DIRT, he said he would retire shortly and the accounts would be closed\\".Nuncio quit Dublin role after bank accounts questioned References Category:1914 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:Italian titular archbishops Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Ireland Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Lebanon Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Chile Category:Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy alumni ","title":"Gaetano Alibrandi"},{"id":"266224","text":"Battle of Quebec may refer to: *Battle of Quebec (1690), a failed English assault during the War of the Grand Alliance *Battle of Quebec (1759) or Battle of the Plains of Abraham, a battle in the Seven Years' War *Battle of Quebec (1760) or Battle of Sainte-Foy, a battle outside the city during the Seven Years' War *Battle of Quebec (1775), a failed American assault during the American Revolutionary War *Battle of Quebec (ice hockey), a sports rivalry between the Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques See also *Surrender of Quebec in 1629 during the Anglo-French War *Quebec Expedition, a 1711 British expedition during Queen Anne's War *Battle of Beauport, a failed 1759 British assault on the city by way of its suburb of Beauport *Invasion of Quebec (1775), an American invasion during the American Revolutionary War *Siege of Quebec (disambiguation) ","title":"Battle of Quebec"},{"id":"266226","text":"Cold medicines are medications used by people with the common cold, cough, or related conditions. There is, however, no good evidence that cough medications reduce coughing. While they have been used by 10% of American children in any given week, they are not recommended in Canada or the United States in children six years or younger because of lack of evidence showing effect and concerns of harm. One version with codeine, guaifenesin, and pseudoephedrine was the 213th most commonly prescribed medication in 2017, in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Types There are a number of different cough and cold medications, which may be used for various coughing symptoms. The commercially available products may include various combinations of any one or more of the following types of substances: * Mucokinetics, or mucolytics, are a class of drugs which aid in the clearance of mucus from the airways, lungs, bronchi, and trachea. Examples are carbocisteine, ambroxol, and bromhexine. * Expectorants are substances claimed to make coughing easier while enhancing the production of mucus and phlegm. Two examples are acetylcysteine and guaifenesin. * Antitussives, or cough suppressants, are substances which suppress the coughing itself. Examples are codeine, pholcodine, dextromethorphan, noscapine, and butamirate. * Antihistamines, for allergic rhinitis may produce mild sedation and reduce other associated symptoms, like a runny nose and watery eyes. Examples are diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, brompheniramine, loratadine, and cetirizine. * Decongestants may improve nasal congestion in a sinus infections. Examples are ephedrine, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, and oxymetazoline. * Fever or pain medication. Examples are paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen. * Also employed are various substances supposed to soften the coughing, like honey or supplement syrup.  Effectiveness  The efficacy of cough medication is questionable, particularly in children.Medsafe cough and cold group A 2014 Cochrane review concluded that \\"There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough\\". Some cough medicines may be no more effective than placebos for acute coughs in adults, including coughs related to upper respiratory tract infections. The American College of Chest Physicians emphasizes that cough medicines are not designed to treat whooping cough, a cough that is caused by bacteria and can last for months. No over-the-counter cough medicines have been found to be effective in cases of pneumonia. They are not recommended in those who have COPD, chronic bronchitis, or the common cold. There is not enough evidence to make recommendations for those who have a cough in cancer. =Medications= * Dextromethorphan (DXM) may be modestly effective in decreasing cough in adults with viral upper respiratory infections. However, in children it has not been found to be effective. * Codeine was once viewed as the \\"gold standard\\" in cough suppressants, but this position is now questioned. Some placebo-controlled trials have found that it is ineffective against some forms of cough, including acute cough in children. It is thus not recommended for children. Additionally, there is no evidence that hydrocodone is useful in children. Similarly, a 2012 Dutch guideline does not recommend its use to treat acute cough. * A number of other commercially available cough treatments have not been shown to be effective in viral upper respiratory infections. These include for adults: antihistamines, antihistamine-decongestant combinations, benzonatate, anti asthmatic- expectorant-mucolytic combinations, expectorant-bronchodilator combinations, leukotriene inhibitors, ambroxol, and guaifenesin, sometimes with analgesics, antipyretics, anti inflammatories, and anticholinergics; and for children: antihistamines, decongestants for clearing the nose, or combinations of these and leukotriene inhibitors for allergy and asthma. However, antihistamines cannot be used as an empirical therapy in case of chronic, or non-specific cough, especially in very young children. Long term diphenhydramine use is associated with negative outcomes in older people. =Alternative medicine= Honey may be a minimally effective cough treatment. A Cochrane review found the evidence to recommend for or against its use in children to be weak. In light of this they found it was better than no treatment, placebo, and diphenhydramine but not better than dextromethorphan for relieving cough symptoms. Honey's use as a cough treatment has been linked on several occasions to infantile botulism and accordingly should not be used in children less than one year old. Many alternative treatments are used to treat the common cold. A 2007 review states that, \\"alternative therapies (i.e., Echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc) are not recommended for treating common cold symptoms; however, ... Vitamin C prophylaxis may modestly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold in the general population and may reduce the incidence of the illness in persons exposed to physical and environmental stresses.\\" A 2014 review also found insufficient evidence for Echinacea. A 2009 review found that the evidence supporting the effectiveness of zinc is mixed with respect to cough, and a 2011 Cochrane review concluded that zinc \\"administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration and severity of the common cold in healthy people\\". A 2003 review concluded: \\"Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms.\\" Zinc gel in the nose may lead to long-term or permanent loss of smell. The FDA therefore discourages its use. Adverse effects A number of accidental overdoses and well-documented adverse effects suggested caution in children. The FDA in 2015 warned that the use of codeine- containing cough medication in children may cause breathing problems. Cold syrup overdose has been linked to visual and auditory hallucinations as well as rapid involuntary jaw, tongue, and eye movements in children. Cough medicines can be abused as recreational drugs.  History  Heroin was originally marketed as a cough suppressant in 1898. It was, at the time, believed to be a non-addictive alternative to other opiate-containing cough syrups. This was quickly realized not to be true as heroin readily breaks down into morphine in the body. Morphine was already known to be addictive. Society and culture =Brands= Some brand names include: Benilyn, Sudafed, Robitussin and Vicks among others. Most contain a number of active ingredients. Sudafed is a brand manufactured by McNeil Laboratories. The original formulation contains the active ingredient pseudoephedrine, but formulations without pseudoephedrine are also being sold under the brand. In 2016, it was one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of ¬£34.4 million. The effectiveness of phenylephrine by mouth as a nasal decongestant is questionable. Gee's Linctus is a cough medicine which contains opium tincture. New Zealand in 2019 moved it to prescription only. Coricidin, Coricidin D, or Coricidin HBP, is the brand name of a combination of dextromethorphan and chlorpheniramine maleate (an antihistamine). Varieties may also contain acetaminophen and guaifenesin. Codral is a brand name manufactured by Johnson & Johnson and sold primarily in Australia and New Zealand. Codral is the highest-selling cold and flu medication in Australia. =Economics= In the United States, several billion dollars are spent on over-the-counter products per year. =Poisoning= According to The New York Times, at least eight mass poisonings have occurred as a result of counterfeit cough syrup in which medical-grade glycerin has been replaced with diethylene glycol, an inexpensive, yet toxic, glycerin substitute marketed for industrial use. In May 2007, 365 deaths were reported in Panama, which were associated with cough syrup containing diethylene glycol. =Abuse= A number of types of cough medicine are frequently abused. This includes those containing dextromethorphan and codeine. Abuse may result in hallucinations, loss of consciousness and death.

The island is separated from the main island of Singapore by a channel of water, the Keppel Harbour, and is adjacent to Pulau Brani, a smaller island wedged between Sentosa and the main island. Formerly used as a British military base and then a Japanese prisoner- of-war camp, the island was renamed Sentosa and was planned to be a popular tourist destination. It is now home to a popular resort that receives more than twenty million visitors per year. Attractions include a long sheltered beach, Madame Tussauds Singapore, an extensive Cable Car network, Fort Siloso, two golf courses, 14 hotels and the Resorts World Sentosa, which features the Universal Studios Singapore theme park and one of Singapore's two casinos, the other being Marina Bay Sands. Sentosa is also widely known as being the location of the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States Singapore Summit, where North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump met at the Capella Hotel located on the island. This was the first-ever meeting between the leaders of North Korea and the United States. Etymology Sentosa is marked as Blacan mati (left, above Singapura) for \\"belakang mati\\" in this 1604 map of Singapura by the Malay-Portuguese cartographer Manuel Godinho de Er√©dia. The Malay Peninsula (Ujontana) to the right. The name Sentosa translates as \\"peace and tranquility\\" in Malay, which was in turn derived from the Sanskrit term Santosha, meaning \\"contentment, satisfaction\\".Peter H Van Ness, Yoga as Spiritual but not Religious: A Pragmatic Perspective , American Journal of Theology & Philosophy, Vol. 20, No. 1 (January 1999), pages 15-30 Sentosa was formerly known as Pulau Blakang MatiVictor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2003), Toponymics ‚Äî A Study of Singapore Street Names, Eastern Universities Press, which in Malay means the \\"Island of Death Behind\\". The name Blakang Mati is old; an island was identified as Blacan Mati in Manuel Godinho de Er√©dia's 1604 map of Singapore. Other early references to the island of Blakang Mati include Burne Beard Island in Wilde's 1780 MS map, Pulau Niry, Nirifa from 1690 to 1700, and the nineteenth century reference as Pulau Panjang (J.H. Moor). However, early maps did not separate Blakang Mati from the adjacent island of Pulau Brani, so it is uncertain to which island the seventeenth century place names referred. The island has changed name several times. Up to 1830, it was called Pulau Panjang (\\"long island\\"). In an 1828 sketch of Singapore Island, the island is referred to as Po. Panjang. According to Bennett (1834), the name Blakang Mati was only given to the hill on the island by the Malay villagers on the island. The Malay name for this island is literally translated as \\"dead back\\" or \\"behind the dead\\"; blakang means \\"at the back\\" or \\"behind\\" or \\"after\\"; mati means \\"dead\\". It is also called the \\"dead island\\" or the \\"island of the dead\\" or perhaps \\"island of after death\\". There are a number of different suggestions on how the island came to acquire such an unpropitious name: *One account attributed the ominous name to murder and piracy in the island's past. *A second claimed that the island is the material paradise for the spirits of warriors said to have been buried at Pulau Brani. *A third account claims that an outbreak of disease on the island in the late 1840s almost wiped out the original Bugis settlers on the island. Dr Robert Little, a British coroner investigating the deaths, stumbled upon what was called Blakang Mati Fever, purportedly a type of fever caused by miasmastic fumes arising from decaying leaves and swampy water on the island. This led to a controversy in medical circles at that time as to the causes of this disease. The disease was later recognised in 1898 as malaria spread by the Anopheles mosquito. The government's malaria research station was originally located here. *A fourth interpretation is that \\"dead back island\\" was so-called because of the lack of fertile soil on the hills. However, since the island creates an area of dead water behind it with no wind (hence \\"still behind\\" - still or stopped being an alternative translation of mati) it may be as simple as this ‚Äî less romantic perhaps, but believable from a nautical viewpoint. Mainland Singapore In 1827, Captain Edward Lake of the Bengal Engineer Group in his report on public works and fortifications had proposed an alternative name for Blakang Mati as the \\"Island of St George\\". However, the island was seen as too unhealthy for habitation and his proposed name was never realised. The Tallest Merlion statue on Sentosa which has since been permanently closed In a 1972 contest organised by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board, the island was renamed Sentosa, a Malay word meaning \\"peace and tranquility\\", from Sanskrit, Santosha. History =Early period= Pulau Blakang Mati was once home to the native Malays who were relocated to the mainland, together with the Pulau Brani villagers, due to urban redevelopment in the late 1970s. In the nineteenth century, the island was considered important because it protected the passage into Keppel Harbour. Plans to fortify the island as part of the defence plan for Singapore were drawn up as early as 1827, but few fortifications actually materialised until the 1880s, when the rapid growth of the harbour led to concern over the protection of coal stocks against enemy attack. The four forts built on the island were Fort Siloso, Fort Serapong, Fort Connaught and the Mount Imbiah Battery.National Heritage Board (2002), Singapore's 100 Historic Places, Archipelago Press, The western end of Pulau Belakang Mati, the place where Fort Siloso is now, used to be called sarang rimau (the tiger's den). Selusuh is a kind of herb used as a remedy in childbirth, but there is no explanation of how the fort came to be so called, the orang laut of Kampong Kopit only knowing the place by the name of sarang rimau. By the 1930s, the island was heavily fortified and a crucial component of Fortress Singapore, and the base of the Royal Artillery. =Second World War= During the Second World War, the island was a British military fortress. The British set up large-calibre gun fortifications at various points along the island that were aligned to the south, facing the sea in expectation of a seaward Japanese assault. The myth that the guns were incapable of pointing north developed after the War but this was wrong, they could swivel to point north but they were only equipped with armour-piercing shells for ships which made the shells ineffective against land based forces. The Japanese invaded and captured Singapore from the north, after having done the same to Malaya (now known as West or Peninsular Malaysia). Following the surrender of the Allied Forces on 15 February 1942, Fort Siloso became a prisoner of war camp, housing Australian and British prisoners of the Japanese. During the Japanese Occupation, under the Sook Ching Operation, Chinese men who were suspected, often arbitrarily, of being involved in anti-Japanese activities were brutally killed. 300 bodies, riddled with bullet wounds, washed up on the beach of Pulau Belakang Mati, and were buried by the British prisoners. =1945‚Äì72= Pulau Blakang Mati map, 1945 After the Japanese surrender in 1945 and the return of Singapore to British rule, the island became the base of the locally enlisted First Singapore Regiment of the Royal Artillery (1st SRRA) in 1947. Other locally enlisted men from Singapore were sent to the island for basic military training before being sent to other units of the British Army in Singapore. Ten years later, the 1st SRRA was disbanded and its guns dismantled. The coast artillery was replaced with Gurkha infantry units, first the 2/7th Duke of Edinburgh's own Gurkha Rifles and later the 2/10th Princess Mary's own Gurkha Rifles. Fort Siloso and Mount Imbiah became a religious retreat and a Protestant church house respectively. Fort Connaught was left in ruins. Fort Serapong became a secure communications and listening station. In the early 1960s, during the Indonesian Confrontation, the 2/10th occupied the island. Even though Indonesia was in close proximity there were few amateurish attempts of direct action by the Indonesians against Singapore, . The Gurkha battalion rotated on a six monthly basis to Borneo where most military action during Confrontation took place. A significant parade took place on the island during Confrontation to announce the award of the Victoria Cross to Rambahadur Limbu for an action in Borneo. With the end of the Confrontation in 1966 and the withdrawal of the Gurkha battalion from the island, the British handed over Sentosa to the Singapore Armed Forces of the newly independent Government of Singapore in 1967. In 1967, Pulau Blakang Mati became the base for the Singapore Naval Volunteer Force, which relocated there from its old base at Telok Ayer Basin. The School of Maritime Training was also set up there, as was the first Naval Medical Centre. It became part of the Republic of Singapore Navy. Also in 1967, Pulau Blakang Mati became the military base for the School of Field Engineers, which relocated there from Pasir Leba Camp. The Field Engineer School trained the 1st Batch of Combat Engineer Commanders who in turn trained the 1st batch of Full Time National Servicemen who were enlisted in 1968. The 1st operational Combat Engineer Battalion was also raised here. The Engineer Headquarters (EHQ) was established here 1970 before moving to Gillman Camp in 1971. =1970s= Aerial perspective of Sentosa's Bridge In the late 1960s, the government began to set out proposals for developing the island, and a contest to find a new name for the island was held in November 1969. The island was renamed \\"Sentosa\\" in September 1970, which means peace and tranquility in Malay (from Sanskrit, Santosha), from a suggestion by the public. In March 1971, the government announced plans to develop the island into a holiday resort for local visitors and tourists, and a S$124-million plan for developing Sentosa was unveiled in March 1972. The Sentosa Development Corporation was formed and incorporated on 1 September 1972 to oversee the development of the island. Since then, some S$420 million of private capital and another S$500 million of government funds have been invested to develop the island. In 1974 the Singapore Cable Car system was built, linking Sentosa to Mount Faber. Finally, in 1975, the Republic of Singapore Navy had moved out from the Sentosa to Pulau Brani Island. A series of attractions were subsequently opened for visitors including Fort Siloso, Surrender Chamber wax museum, Musical Fountain, and the Underwater World. The causeway bridge was opened in 1992 connecting Sentosa to the mainland. The Sentosa Monorail system was opened in 1982 to transport visitors across seven stations located around the western side of the island. =1989= The former political prisoner and Nobel prize nominee Chia Thye Poh spent three-and-a- half years in internal exile on Sentosa after he was freed from 23 years in jail in 1989. = 2005 = On 16 March 2005, the monorail service was discontinued to make way for the new Sentosa Express, which commenced operations on 15 January 2007. An environmental assessment conducted by the government of Singapore concluded that the construction of an integrated resort on Sentosa would result in a high likelihood of high scale biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, soil erosion and climate change, as well as several other destructive ecological impacts. Therefore, over two hundred trees and plants from the area that was to be cleared for the construction of the resorts were replanted elsewhere on the island to minimize negative environmental impact. In 2009, construction of a new foot bridge began. The S$70 million Sentosa Boardwalk includes themed gardens, shops and eateries. There are covered walkways and travellators along the boardwalk for rainy days. The Boardwalk, officially opened by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on 29 January 2011, provides visitors with an alternative mode of travel to reach the island. Sentosa Boardwalk, designed by Aedas, was named Best Leisure Architecture in Asia Pacific and 5* Best Leisure Architecture in Singapore, at this year's Asia Pacific Property Awards. =2018= The island hosted the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit between the United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea on 12 June 2018, at the Capella Hotel. Sentosa island was gazetted as a 'special event area' by the Singapore Government and the Capella Hotel was chosen as the venue by the White House, a week prior to the summit. In his 2018 autobiography, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong revealed that, when the tourism sector was suffering, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew made an attempt to allow a nudist resort to be built on Sentosa in order to attract tourists, but the motion was ultimately vetoed. Geography The island has an area of close to . It lies just half a kilometre (a quarter of a mile) away from the southern coast of the main island of Singapore. It is Singapore's fourth-largest island (excluding the main island). 70% of the island was covered by secondary rainforest, the habitat of monitor lizards, monkeys, peacocks, parrots as well as other native fauna and flora, also, when the construction of Resorts World Sentosa commenced; environmental impact was kept at a minimum when over two hundred trees in the designated area were replanted elsewhere on the island. Further development has significantly impacted the biodiversity of the island, resulting in the loss of much of the native fauna and flora. The island also has a stretch of white sand beach, which has impacted the reef. Significantly large portions of land are currently being added to Sentosa due to land reclamation. Facilities =Transport= A retired Volvo B7RLE on the Blue Line. Buses currently serve as the main means of getting to and around Sentosa. It is fitted with Twin Vision EDS. Beach station of Sentosa Express monorail at Sentosa island Sentosa can be reached from the Singapore mainland via a short causeway or Cable Car, which originates from Mount Faber and passes through HarbourFront en route to its final destination at Imbiah Lookout. In 2015, Sentosa opened an intra-island Cable Car to facilitate travelling within the island. Dubbed the sky network, the Cable Car has 3 stations, in Siloso, Imbiah and near the now-closed Merlion, and is not linked to the original Cable Car. Public bus services are available to connect Sentosa Island to the mainland. Tong Tar Transport service RWS8 operates between VivoCity/ HarbourFront station to Resorts World Sentosa. SMRT Express Bus Services 188R and 963R operates between Choa Chu Kang and Woodlands respectively Resorts World Sentosa on weekends and public holidays. On 30 June 2017, SBS Transit Bus Service 123 was extended to enhance connectivity to Resorts World Sentosa, Merlion Tower (now closed) and Beach Station Bus Terminal. The island is also accessible by the Sentosa Express monorail, which replaced the old Sentosa Monorail that operated from 1982 to 2005. The Sentosa Express has three stations on Sentosa and one on mainland Singapore. The northern terminus of the line, which opened on 15 January 2007, is located at the VivoCity shopping mall on the mainland and the southernmost terminus, Beach Station, is located on Sentosa Island. In Vivocity, the mainland MRT is in turn served by the HarbourFront of the North East Line and the Circle Line. Within Sentosa there are three bus services, identified as Bus A, Bus B and Bus C. Bus C duplicates Bus A's service entirely but both are operating. Since 1998, passenger cars have been allowed to enter the island. Visitors can also access the island via the Sentosa Boardwalk which is parallel to the causeway (which opened on 29 January 2011). The first two days of its opening were marked with free entry into Sentosa for visitors who walk, and subsequently a SGD 1 admission fee into Sentosa is charged. From 7 June 2014 to 4 January 2015, walk-in entry into Sentosa via the Sentosa Boardwalk is free on weekends and public holidays. Walk-in has been free of charge since the end of SG50 celebrations. The Sentosa Boardwalk hosts frequent bazaars on weekends. Sentosa Beach Tram is a tram which serves Palawan Beach, Siloso Beach and Tanjong Beach, using four vehicles including 2 Volvo B12BLEAs, in which second carriage is an open top and another one with green and blue liveries. The Volvo B12BLEAs were manufactured by ComfortDelGro Engineering bodywork. The connection is at Beach Station. Seprately, a 3 car tram used to serve Underwater world . An Autonomous Bus Trial was also conducted in mid 2019 to end 2019. =Attractions= Aerial of Sentosa Island Singapore Royal Albatross Operating attractions Sentosa offers a variety of attractions, museums and other facilities. These include Universal Studios and Madame Tussauds chain of attractions, as well as a Marine Life Park, which consists of a water park and an aquarium. Most of the attractions on Sentosa are located in either Resorts World Sentosa, Imbiah Lookout, or the Sentosa Beachfront. *The Royal Albatross is a unique 47m class A luxury Tall Ship (pirate ship) that is berthed behind the SEA Aquarium at Resorts World Sentosa. The ship has 4 masts, 22 sails and is the largest charter yacht in Singapore, with a capacity of 149 passengers. It is owned and operated by Tall Ship Adventures Pte Ltd and can be chartered by the hour or day for private and corporate events. The company also sell tickets for short cruises via their website.

For some time it was a popular attraction which ferried 9 million passengers to and from Sentosa, but passenger traffic started to decline steadily after 1998 when cars were allowed into the island for the first time. The Ferry Terminal Monorail Station of the now defunct Sentosa Monorail once connected tourists to the western half of the island, but it no longer does after the station closed in 2005. The ferry terminal itself was demolished along with the Sentosa Musical Fountain and the Fountain Gardens that connected the terminal to the musical fountain in 2007 to make way for Resorts World Sentosa which would occupy the area.

It has a lifting speed of 1.2 metres per second and weighs 200 metric tonnes. On a clear day, the view extends to parts of Malaysia, Johor Bahru (30 km / 18 miles), Indonesia, Pulau Bintan (45 km / 28 miles) and Pulau Bantan (43 km / 27 miles). At ground level, visitors enter a large disc-shaped air-conditioned cabin fitted with glass windows all around. The cabin then revolves slowly as it ascends the column of the tower. The cabin has a capacity of 72 visitors. The Sky Tower sits at the very spot of what was formerly known as the Dragon Court. It had a dragon statue as the centerpiece with water spouting from its mouth. In one of its claws, it held a previous logo of Sentosa which was used in the early 1980s. Its tail ended at the Dragon Trail in the northern part of Imbiah Lookout. The statue was demolished a few months before the groundbreaking ceremony of the Sky Tower. The Sky Tower was officially opened on 7 February 2004, is situated in the Imbiah Lookout zone in the centre of Sentosa and can be reached by Cable Car, Sentosa Luge Chair Lift, the Sentosa Express or by internal bus.

A resort developer and operator was chosen on 8 December 2006. The winning proposal was the Genting/Star Cruises consortium in their bid for Resorts World Sentosa. It has a Universal Studios Theme Park (known as Universal Studios Singapore) which occupies nearly half of the resort space. Development of the resort was financed privately at a cost of $SGD5.75 billion and it does not receive any government subsidies. The proposal for a casino was met with extensive opposition from many conservative critics. Nevertheless, the government has constantly reassured the public that there would be stringent measures in place to maintain the social fabric of the nation Singapore, and to prevent problems such as gambling addiction. It is also home to several celebrity chef restaurants, including Jo√´l Robuchon, and the Ocean Restaurant by Cat Cora, which faces the open ocean display of the S.E.A. Aquarium. The Adventure Cove waterpark offers water rides (including the Southeast Asia's first hydro wet coaster), and marine experiences like swimming with dolphins, sharks, manta rays, as well as snorkeling in an artificial reef. It also has a concert venue known as the Hard Rock Colosseum, which has played host to musical acts like Of Monsters and Men, Jimmy Eat World and Bastille. On 14 February 2010 at exactly 12:18 p.m., which was also the first day of the Chinese New Year, Resorts World Sentosa was opened to the public. In Cantonese, \\"1218\\" sounds like \\"prosperity\\", hence the opening time. The resort's main attractions include Universal Studios Singapore, Adventure Cove water park, S.E.A. Aquarium, the Maritime Experiential Museum, The Royal Albatross and the Trick Eye Museum Singapore. Sustainability Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) has developed a sustainability plan to safeguard the environment and to conserve Sentosa's heritage assets. In fact, many parts of Sentosa still retain her original tranquil and lush environment - driven by the Corporation's land-use policy of maintaining 60% of the island as green and open spaces (natural area reduced to about 25% by 2014). Efforts are made to raise awareness among both visitors and staff of the island regarding environmental issues and sustainable tourism. This is done via regular campaigns and educational talks. Key sustainability-related achievements include: * Sentosa was shortlisted as a Sustainable Tourism Destination finalist in the World Travel and Tourism Council's \\"Tourism for Tomorrow\\" Awards in 2013. * The island is home to some 30 heritage trees (listed in the National Parks Board's Heritage Tree RegisterNParks Heritage Tree Register ) and over 20 conserved colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 1800s. * Singapore's only fully restored coastal military fort, Fort Siloso. * Several Green Mark-certified buildings such as Sentosa Cove Village, Sentosa Family Entertainment Centre, W Hotel, and Resorts World Sentosa. The Green Mark is awarded by Singapore's Building and Construction Authority to buildings that fulfill specific environmentally friendly criteria. * An award- winning eco-hotel, Siloso Beach Resort. * Developing the Sentosa Boardwalk, which is a covered pedestrian walkway with various sustainability features, to connect the island with the Singapore mainland. Guests are encouraged to use the Boardwalk to enter and exit Sentosa as it leaves a minimal carbon footprint. * Partnering with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to testbed Singapore's first low-flow tidal turbine at the Sentosa Boardwalk. * Community-giving initiatives such as an annual \\"Sentosa Gives\\" initiative in September, which sees more than 1,500 children, teenagers and seniors from the participating voluntary welfare organizations, schools and charities benefiting from the many activities planned for them. The Corporation also offers island entry concessions to charity groups throughout the year.

Ra æs Juby, ) is a cape on the coast of southern Morocco, near the border with Western Sahara, directly east of the Canary Islands. Its surrounding area, called the Cape Juby Strip or Tarfaya Strip, while making up presently the far south of Morocco, makes up a semi-desert buffer zone between Morocco proper and the Western Sahara. The Strip was under Spanish rule as part of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco during the first half of the 20th century.  Modern history  = Precolonial era = On May 28, 1767, Mohammed ben Abdallah, the Sultan of Morocco, signed a peace and commerce treaty with King Charles III of Spain. In the treaty, Morocco was unable to guarantee the security of Spanish fishermen along the coasts south of the Noun River, as Morocco did not have control over the Tekna tribes of that area (Art. 18). On March 1, 1799, Sultan Slimane signed an accord with King Charles IV of Spain, in which he recognized that the Saguia el Hamra and Cape Juby regions were not part of his dominions (Art. 22). In 1879, the British North West African Company established a trading post near Cape Juby called \\"Port Victoria\\". On March 26, 1888, Moroccan soldiers attacked the post, killing the director of the post and leaving two workers badly injured. In 1895, the company sold its post to the Sultan of Morocco. = Spanish protectorate = In 1912, Spain negotiated with France (which controlled the affairs of Morocco at the time) for concessions on the southern coast of Morocco. officially occupied the Cape Juby region for Spain on July 29, 1916. It was administered by Spain as a single entity with Spanish Sahara and the Ifni enclave, as Spanish West Africa. The Spanish area comprised and had a population of 9,836. Its main town was founded by the Spanish as Villa Bens (now called Tarfaya). Villa Bens was used as a staging post for airmail flights. = Retrocession to Morocco = When Morocco became independent in 1956, it requested the cession of Moroccan areas controlled by Spain. After some resistance and some fighting during 1957 (the Ifni War), the Spanish government in 1958 ceded the Cape Juby Strip to Morocco.  Sahara sea  In 1877, the Scottish engineer Donald Mackenzie was the first to propose the creation of a Sahara Sea. Mackenzie's idea was to cut a channel from one of the sand-barred lagoons north of Cape Juby south to a large plain which Arab traders had identified to him as El Djouf. Mackenzie believed this vast region was up to below sea level and that flooding it would create an inland sea of suited to commercial navigation and even agriculture. He further believed that geological evidence suggested this basin had once been connected to the Atlantic via a channel near the Saguia el-Hamra. He proposed that this inland sea, if augmented with a canal, could provide access to the Niger River and the markets and rich resources of West Africa. There are several small depressions in the vicinity of Cape Juby; at 55 m below sea level, the Sebkha Tah:fr:Sebkha Tah is the lowest and largest. But it covers less than 250 km¬≤ and is 500 km north of the geographical area identified as El Djouf (also known as the Majabat al-Koubra) which has an average elevation of 320 m. Mackenzie never travelled in this area but had read of other sub-sea level desert basins in present-day Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt similar to those found near Cape Juby. These basins contain seasonally dry salt lakes, known as chotts or sebkhas. Egypt's Qattara Depression is perhaps the largest such basin in North Africa.

Picture taken in the period 1926‚Äì1930 Sir Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, FBA (21 September 1902 ‚Äì 11 September 1973), known as E. E. Evans-Pritchard, was an English anthropologist who was instrumental in the development of social anthropology. He was Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford from 1946 to 1970. Education and field work Evans-Pritchard was educated at Winchester College and studied history at Exeter College, Oxford, where he was influenced by R. R. Marett, and then as a postgraduate at the London School of Economics (LSE). At Oxford he was part of the Hypocrites' Club. At LSE he came under the influence of Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski and especially Charles Gabriel Seligman, the founding ethnographer of the Sudan. His first fieldwork began in 1926 with the Azande, a people of the upper Nile, and resulted in both a doctorate (in 1927) and his classic Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande (in 1937). Evans-Pritchard continued to lecture at the LSE and conduct research in Azande and BongoBongo rain-shrine and grave accessed 19 August 2008 land until 1930, when he began a new research project among the Nuer. This work coincided with his appointment to the University of Cairo in 1932, where he gave a series of lectures on religion that bore Seligman's influence. After his return to Oxford, he continued his research on Nuer. It was during this period that he first met Meyer Fortes and A. R. Radcliffe-Brown. Evans-Pritchard began developing Radcliffe-Brown's program of structural-functionalism. As a result, his trilogy of works on the Nuer (The Nuer, Nuer Religion, and Kinship and Marriage Among the Nuer) and the volume he coedited entitled African Political Systems came to be seen as classics of British social anthropology. Evans- Pritchard's Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande is the first major anthropological contribution to the sociology of knowledge through its neutral ‚Äî some would say \\"relativist\\" ‚Äî stance on the \\"correctness\\" of Zande beliefs about causation. His work focused in on a known psychological effect known as psychological attribution. Evans-Pritchard recorded the tendencies of Azandes to blame or attribute witchcraft as the cause of various mis-happenings. The most notable of these issues involved the deaths of eight Azande people due to the collapse of a termite infested door frame. Evans-Pritchard's empirical work in this vein became well-known through philosophy of science and \\"rationality\\" debates of the 1960s and 1970s involving Thomas Kuhn and especially Paul Feyerabend. During the Second World War Evans-Pritchard served in Ethiopia, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. In Sudan he raised irregular troops among the Anuak to harass the Italians and engaged in guerrilla warfare. In 1942 he was posted to the British Military Administration of Cyrenaica in North Africa, and it was on the basis of his experience there that he produced The Sanusi of Cyrenaica. In documenting local resistance to Italian conquest, he became one of a few English-language authors to write about the tariqa. After a brief stint in Cambridge, Evans-Pritchard became professor of social anthropology at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of All Souls College. He remained at All Souls College for the rest of his career. Among the doctoral students he advised was the late M. N. Srinivas, the doyen among India's sociologists who coined some of the key concepts in Indian sociological discourse, including \\"Sanskritization\\", \\"dominant caste\\" and \\"vote bank.\\" One of his students was Talal Asad, who now teaches at the City University of New York. Mary Douglas's classic Purity and Danger on pollutions and uncertainty ‚Äî what we often denote as 'risk' ‚Äî was fundamentally influenced by Evans- Pritchard's views on how accusations, blame and responsibility are deployed though culturally specific conceptions of misfortune and harm. Later theories Evans-Pritchard's later work was more theoretical, drawing upon his experiences as anthropologist to philosophize on the nature of anthropology and how it should best be practiced. In 1950 he famously disavowed the commonly held view that anthropology was a natural science, arguing instead that it should be grouped amongst the humanities, especially history. He argued that the main issue facing anthropologists was one of translation‚Äîfinding a way to translate one's own thoughts into the world of another culture and thus manage to come to understand it, and then to translate this understanding back so as to explain it to people of one's own culture. In 1965, he published the highly influential work Theories of Primitive Religion, arguing against the existing theories of what at the time were called \\"primitive\\" religious practices. Arguing along the lines of his theoretical work of the 1950s, he claimed that anthropologists rarely succeeded in entering the minds of the people they studied, and so ascribed to them motivations which more closely matched themselves and their own culture, not the one they were studying. He also argued that believers and non- believers approached the study of religion in vastly different ways, with non- believers being quicker to come up with biological, sociological, or psychological theories to explain religion as an illusion, and believers being more likely to come up with theories explaining religion as a method of conceptualizing and relating to reality. Life and family Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard was born in Crowborough, East Sussex, England, the son of an Anglican clergyman. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1944. Known to his friends and family as \\"EP\\", Evans-Pritchard had five children with his wife Ioma. His daughter Deirdre Evans-Pritchard is Executive Director of the DC Independent Film Festival and consults in the fields of cultural heritage, tourism, media and the arts. His youngest son, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, is a former foreign correspondent in Latin America, the US, and Europe, and became International Business Editor for the London Daily Telegraph.

Stevens Point Highway 82 bridge over the Wisconsin River Boating on the Wisconsin River Delta at the Mississippi River, seen from Wyalusing State Park The Wisconsin River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. At approximately 430 miles (692 km) long, it is the state's longest river. The river's name, first recorded in 1673 by Jacques Marquette as \\"Meskousing\\", is rooted in the Algonquian languages used by the area's American Indian tribes, but its original meaning is obscure. French explorers who followed in the wake of Marquette later modified the name to \\"Ouisconsin\\", and so it appears on Guillaume de L'Isle's map (Paris, 1718). This was simplified to \\"Wisconsin\\" in the early 19th century before being applied to Wisconsin Territory and finally the state of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin River originates in the forests of the North Woods Lake District of northern Wisconsin, in Lac Vieux Desert near the border of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It flows south across the glacial plain of central Wisconsin, passing through Wausau, Stevens Point, and Wisconsin Rapids. In southern Wisconsin it encounters the terminal moraine formed during the last ice age, where it forms the Dells of the Wisconsin River. North of Madison at Portage, the river turns to the west, flowing through Wisconsin's hilly Western Upland and joining the Mississippi approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) south of Prairie du Chien. The highest waterfall on the river is Grandfather Falls in Lincoln County. Geology The modern Wisconsin River was formed in several stages. The lower, westward- flowing portion of the river is located in the unglaciated Driftless Area, and this section of the river's course likely predates the rest by several million years. The lower reach of the river is narrower than its upstream valley, leading to the suggestion the upper portions of the ancestor of the river flowed east previous to the Pleistocene.Steven Dutch, \\"Possible Early Pleistocene Drainage in Wisconsin\\", Retrieved July 17, 2007 The remaining length of the river was formed gradually as glaciers advanced and retreated over Wisconsin. The stretch of river from Stevens Point north to Merrill was a drainage route for meltwater flowing away from the glaciers which covered northern Wisconsin during the Wisconsin Glaciation. As the glaciers retreated further northward, the river also grew in that direction. South from Stevens Point, the meltwater would have flowed into Glacial Lake Wisconsin, a prehistoric proglacial lake that existed in the central part of the state. As temperatures warmed around 15,000 years ago, the ice dam holding the lake in place burst, unleashing a catastrophic flood that carved the Dells of the Wisconsin River and joined the upper stretches of the river with the pre- existing lower river valley that today flows from Portage to Prairie du Chien. Ouisconsin R., in Guillaume de L'Isle's map, 1718 History In the summer of 1673, French missionary Jacques Marquette, French-Canadian explorer Louis Joliet, and their crew of five Metis arrived near the headwaters of the Fox River. From there, they were told to portage their two canoes a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak plains to the Wisconsin River. \\"The river on which we embarked is called Meskousing,\\" wrote Marquette. \\"It is very wide; it has a sandy bottom, which forms various shoals that render its navigation very difficult.\\" In his only other reference to the river, Marquette says that the Mississippi is \\"narrow at the place where Miskous empties.\\" After they returned, Joliet used the name \\"Miskonsing\\" on a map that he drew in 1674, and when the news of their voyage was first published in 1681 the book's author, Melchisedec Thevenot, called it the \\"Mescousin\\" River. The name used today was born when the explorer Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, misread Marquette's initial M, which was written by hand in cursive script, \\"Ou\\" in 1674. This found its way onto printed maps, even though in a report written in 1682 La Salle tried to correct himself: \\"On the east one comes first to the river called by the Savages Ouisconsing, or Misconsing, which flows from the east.\\" Over the next two decades the initial M completely disappeared as writers and mapmakers always called the river by some version that began with a vowel. For the next 150 years the river, and by extension our part of the world generally, was known as \\"Ouisconsin.\\" Sloppy printers sometimes turned this into Ouriconsing, Ouiscousen, and even Ouiskonche (the first of which may have been the origin of the toponym \\"Oregon\\"), but the \\"Ouis ‚Ä¶\\" spelling was the one most often used by both French and English writers until the mid-19th century. As American soldiers and officials traveled through the area for the first time following the War of 1812, they initially used the French spelling. But when large numbers of lead miners streamed into the country south of the river in the 1820s, the U.S. government began to refer to it differently in debates and legislation. These legal documents created by the government in Washington sometimes used the French spelling, but they gradually introduced the uniquely American, \\"Wisconsin.\\" The U.S. House of Representatives Journal was the first to print it (in the entry for February 1, 1830), during discussion of \\"laying out a town at Helena, on the Wisconsin river, in the Territory of Michigan ‚Ä¶\\" In the five years that followed, the modern spelling was used with increasing frequency in government publications as well as in commercially published books and maps. In 1836, when territorial status was authorized on July 4, the name became officially \\"Wisconsin\\" (though Canadian and French writers often used \\"Ouisconsin\\" until the end of the 19th century). Oddly, the person who did the most to create Wisconsin Territory didn't like the name. James Duane Doty, who first visited the region in 1820, was the principal advocate for the spelling \\"Wiskonsan\\", which shows up dozens of times through the early 1840s. \\"During all this time, Governor Doty and the legislature were in constant hostility,\\" wrote contemporary observer Theodore Rodolf. \\"One of the governor's vagaries had to be settled by a joint resolution. The governor had a fondness for spelling the name of the territory as \\"Wiskonsan.\\" The Legislature, in order to avoid future embarrassments and misunderstandings, found itself obliged to declare by a joint resolution that the spelling used in the organic act should be maintained.\\" The first documented exploration of the Wisconsin River by Europeans took place in 1673, when Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet of France canoed from Lake Michigan up the Fox River until reaching the present-day site of Portage in early June. At this location the Wisconsin and Fox rivers are only 2 miles (3.2 km) distant, so the explorers could portage from the Fox to the Wisconsin River. They then continued downstream 200 miles (320 km) to the Wisconsin's mouth, entering the Mississippi on June 17. Other explorers and traders would follow the same route, and for the next 150 years the Wisconsin and Fox rivers, collectively known as the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway, formed a major transportation route between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Industry began to form on the Wisconsin in the early 19th century, as loggers started using the river to raft logs downstream from northern forests to sawmills in new cities like Wausau. By the 1880s, logging companies were damming the river to ensure the river had enough capacity for the logs being floated downstream. Later, at the start of the 20th century, more dams were constructed to provide for flood control and hydroelectricity. The dams also spurred tourism, creating reservoirs such as Lake Wisconsin that are popular areas for recreational boating and fishing. Today the Wisconsin River is the hardest working river in the nation. There are 25 operating Hydroelectric Power Plants on the Wisconsin River. The \\"hydros\\" harness 645 feet of the rivers fall to generate nearly one billion kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year ‚Äî enough energy to supply the residential needs of over 300,000 people without creating any pollution. Despite this, a 93-mile (150 km) stretch of the Wisconsin between its mouth and the hydroelectric dam at Prairie du Sac is free of any dams or barriers and is relatively free-flowing. In the late 1980s, this portion of the river was designated as a state riverway, and development alongside the river has been limited to preserve its scenic integrity. Navigable river of the United States The Wisconsin River is a \\"navigable river of the United States.\\" This designation primarily means that the federal government has jurisdiction for dams on the river. Dams that include hydropower facilities are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Courts have ruled that despite the fact that the river lies entirely in one state, it nevertheless historically carried goods to markets in other states and therefore is subject to the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. Courts have also ruled that raw logs, even if merely carried via log drives to mills within the state, constitute commerce. On the basis of these judgments, the Wisconsin River is considered a navigable waterway throughout its entire length.Wisconsin Public Service Corp. v. Federal Power Commission 147 F.2d 743 (1945). This designation does not generally have bearing on recreational use of the river. Boat registrations and fishing licenses are obtained through the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, for example.http://www.nationalrivers.org/states/wi-law.htm Lower Wisconsin River State Riverway The Lower Wisconsin River State Riverway is a state- funded project designed to protect the southern portion of the Wisconsin River. It extends from Sauk City to the point where the Wisconsin River empties into the Mississippi, about south of the city of Prairie du Chien. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources manages protected lands of over , including the river itself, islands, and some lands adjacent to the river. In 2020 the riverway was designated as a protected Ramsar site. There are no dams or man-made obstructions to the natural flow of water between the hydroelectric dam just north of Sauk City and the confluence of the Wisconsin and the Mississippi. This long stretch of free-flowing river provides important natural habitats for a variety of wildlife, including white-tail deer, common otters, beavers, turtles, sandhill cranes, eagles, hawks, and a variety of fish species. Recreational opportunities on the lower Wisconsin River range from fishing and canoeing to tubing and camping. Canoe camping is particularly popular because of the abundance of suitable sandbars along the riverway and because no permits are required. On summer weekends, naturists can be found on Mazo Beach which is north of the village of Mazomanie. According to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, two thirds of river users can be found on the stretch between Prairie du Sac and Spring Green.

It was founded in Palo Alto, California, in 1991. The company uses the design thinking approach to design products, services, environments, and digital experiences.Brown, Tim. \\"The Making of a Design Thinker.\\" Metropolis Oct. 2009: 60‚Äì62. p. 60: \\"David Kelley ... said that every time someone came to ask him about design, he found himself inserting the word thinking to explain what it is that designers do. The term design thinking stuck.\\" In 1996, Steelcase took a majority ownership stake in the firm, which continued to operate independently. By the early 2000s, the company had expanded into management consulting and organizational design. In 2016, Japanese holding company Kyu Collective purchased a minority stake in the firm. Steelcase continues to hold a small stake. The firm currently employs over 700 people across many disciplines related to its branding and design mandates. History IDEO‚Äôs roots date back to 1978. IDEO was formed in 1991 by a merger of David Kelley Design (founded by Stanford University professor David Kelley), London-based Moggridge Associates and San Francisco's ID Two (both founded by British-born Bill Moggridge), and Matrix Product Design (founded by Mike Nuttall). Office-furniture maker Steelcase owned a majority stake in the firm, but began divesting its shares through a five-year management buy-back program in 2007. The founders of the predecessor companies are still involved in the firm with the exception of Bill Moggridge who died on September 8, 2012. In 1996, Steelcase took a majority ownership stake in the firm, which continued to operate independently. By the early 2000s, the company had expanded into management consulting and organizational design. In 2016, Japanese holding company Kyu Collective purchased a minority stake in the firm. While the company started with a focus on designing consumer products (e.g., toothbrush, personal assistant, computers), by 2001, IDEO began to increase focus on consumer experiences (e.g., non-traditional classrooms). This concept is key to IDEO today and is a core value that David Kelley has instilled throughout the company. Their focus on the customer needs first is what has made them so successful as a design firm. In 2011, IDEO incubated IDEO.org ‚Äî a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on people in poor and vulnerable communities. Tim Brown in 2018 In April 2019, the company announced that Sandy Speicher would replace Tim Brown as CEO of the company.Sandy Speicher in 2011 =The Deep Dive= On February 9, 1999, the ABC show Nightline featured IDEO in a segment called The Deep Dive: One Company's Secret Weapon for Innovation. The segment featured Jack Smith of ABC touring the IDEO office and challenging the company to redesign the shopping cart in five days to demonstrate IDEO's process for innovation. The end result was a shopping cart with a nestable steel frame which holds removable plastic baskets to help deter theft and increase shopper flexibility. A dual child seat with a swing-up tray was also included in the design, as well as a cupholder, a scanner to skip the checkout line and steerable back wheels for maneuverability. The demonstration of IDEO's innovation process has led to the segment becoming part of numerous curricula, including Project Lead the Way and multiple universities. = Acquisitions and partnerships = On October 17, 2017, IDEO acquired Datascope - a data science firm based in Chicago. Datascope has worked with IDEO as a consultant on many projects over the past four years. Tim Brown, Chair of IDEO, states that the acquisition is largely motivated by advances in data sciences and machine learning. These advances allow for a bigger focus in human-centered applications including facilitation of the design process. Datascope's 15-person team will be moved to IDEO's Chicago office.  Organizational culture  IDEO's organizational culture consists of project teams, flat hierarchy, individual autonomy, creativity, and collaboration. The firm currently employs over 700 people across many disciplines, including: Behavioral Science, Branding, Business Design, Communication Design, Design Research, Digital Design, Education, Electrical Engineering, Environments Design, Food Science, Healthcare Services, Industrial Design, Interaction Design, Mechanical Engineering, Organizational Design, and Software Engineering.  Products and services  IDEO has worked on projects in the consumer food and beverage, retail, computer, medical, educational, furniture, office, and automotive industries. Some examples include Apple's first mouse, the Palm V PDA, and Steelcase's Leap chair. Clients include Air New Zealand, Coca-Cola, ConAgra Foods, Eli Lilly, Ford, Medtronic, Mexichem, Sealy, ShinHo, and Steelcase among many others. File:Apple Macintosh Plus mouse.jpgThe Apple Mouse File:Palm V.JPGPalm V = OpenIDEO = In August 2010, IDEO introduced OpenIDEO - a collaborative platform for the design process. OpenIDEO was designed to be an internal tool for IDEO to collaborate with clients, but it is now a public tool. The purpose of the tool is to virtually drive the creative process to solve social problems, allowing for people of different expertise and backgrounds to collaborate. Examples of projects that have been facilitated by OpenIDEO include various projects of the WWF and TEDPrize winner Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution movement. In a collaboration with Sutter Health, London's Helix Centre and Shoshana R. Ungerleider, they completed an OpenIDEO Challenge to \\"reimagine the end of life experience\\" which later led to the founding of international initiatives, End Well and Re:imagine. = Design education = IDEO U is an online educational program released in early 2015. Course participants are instructed on the concepts surrounding human-centered design thinking. In addition to the online program, IDEO and its affiliates have released multiple books on design thinking, including New York Times best- selling Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All. Former CEO Tim Brown is the author of Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation (2009) in which he argues that design can transform problems into opportunities ‚Äì emphasizing design thinking as a human-centered activity, he specifically prizes the feeling of empathy, where designers are capable of understanding the perspectives and problems the end users face.

Initially, the office was styled President of the Council of Ministers (), when the term \\"Government\\" included more than the Cabinet, and the Cabinet was called The Council of Ministers (Consiliul de Mini»ôtri). The title was officially changed to Prime Minister by the 1965 Constitution of Romania during the communist regime. The current Prime Minister is Ludovic Orban. Nomination One of the roles of the President of the Republic is to designate a candidate for the office of Prime Minister. The President must consult with the party that has the majority in the Parliament or, if no such majority exists, with the parties represented in Parliament. Once designated, the candidate assembles a proposal for the governing program and the cabinet. The proposal must be approved by the Parliament within ten days, through a vote of confidence process. Both the program and the cabinet membership are debated by the Parliament in a joint session of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The proposal is accepted only if a majority of all Deputies and Senators approves. Once the vote of confidence is obtained, the candidate becomes the Prime Minister and all cabinet members become Ministers. The Prime Minister, the Ministers, and other members of the Government take an oath before the President, as stipulated under Article 82 of the Constitution. The Government as a whole and each of its members exercise their mandate from the date of the oath.  Functions  The Prime Minister directs Government actions and co-ordinates the activities of its members. He or she submits to the Chamber of Deputies or the Senate reports and statements on Government policy, to be debated. As head of the government, the Prime Minister is charged with directing the internal policy of the country and leads the public administration. In this regard, the government cooperates with other interested social actors. As with any other office of public authority, the office of Prime Minister is incompatible with any other office, except that of deputy or senator and is also incompatible with a professional position in a commercial organization. The term of a Prime Minister ends with the individual's resignation, dismissal following a motion of no confidence, loss of electoral rights (following a conviction), incompatibility with the office, death or expiration of the term of the legislature. The Prime Minister, together with the minister tasked with the particular field of government, can sign resolutions and ordinances to take effect as executive orders the moment they are published in the Monitorul Oficial, the official gazette of the Romanian state. Such ordinances must be sent to the appropriate chamber of Parliament where they are discussed in an urgent manner and they are then sent to the official gazette. In case the noticed chamber does not discuss or approve said ordinance after 30 days of its arrival, the ordinance is officially adopted and published in the Monitor. An emergency ordinance cannot modify a constitutional law, concern the functioning of the fundamental institutions, rights or liberties. Unlike in the president-parliamentary semi- presidential systems, such as Russia, the Romanian Prime Minister is not a subordinate of the President who cannot dismiss the Prime Minister. The President can attend the government meetings debating upon matters of national interest with regard to foreign policy, country's defense, maintenance of public order, and, at the invitation of the Prime Minister, in other instances as well. The President will always chair the government meetings he attends. In addition to his constitutional roles, the Prime Minister is, generally, the leader of the major party in the majority coalition that supports the government, although this is not always the case. = Relationship with Parliament = The Government and the other bodies of administration must submit all information, reports or documents requested by the Chamber of Deputies, Senate or parliamentary committees as part of the parliamentary control of government. The members of government are allowed to attend the works of Parliament and they must do so at the request of the presidents of the chambers. The Prime Minister and the members of his Cabinet must answer all questions or interpellations brought forward by deputies or senators as under the terms laid down in the statutes of Parliament. After such interpellations, the Chamber or the Senate can adopt a simple motion to express their position towards an issue of internal or external politics. Parliament can dismiss an outgoing Prime Minister and his cabinet by adopting a motion of no confidence against the government. In order for a motion to be initiated, it must be signed by at least a quarter of deputies and senators and for it to pass, a majority of deputies and senators must vote in favour of it. After a motion of no confidence is adopted, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet are officially dismissed and the President must designate an individual to form a new government. Since 1989, four Prime Ministers have been dismissed following the adoption of a motion of no confidence: Emil Boc (2009), Mihai RƒÉzvan Ungureanu(2012), Sorin Grindeanu(2017) and Viorica DƒÉncilƒÉ(2019).  History  Originally styled President of the Council of Ministers, the office was first created in 1862 during the reign of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Cuza, unlike other monarchs of his time, was not a hereditary ruler. In 1859 he was elected Prince of Wallachia and Prince of Moldavia in two separate elections, thus de facto uniting the two principalities. By 1862, he had completely fused the two administrations into a single government with its capital at Bucharest, the new country bearing the name Romania, but the union was in danger of being dissolved after the end of his rule. A liberal, in favour of the two great reform projects envisioned by the liberals of the time (the electoral and agrarian reforms), Cuza did not publicly espouse his political preferences or position himself as the leader of a faction, preferring to keep the office of the Prince politically neutral. In order to give the country a political government, Cuza created the office of Prime Minister and brought into power the leader of the Conservative faction, Barbu Catargiu. During the first years after its creation the office held considerable authority, being able to challenge the will of the Prince and together with a Legislative Assembly composed mainly of conservatives and reactionaries, Catargiu's conservative government was able to delay the adoption of several reforms. Frustrated by the government's opposition to reforms, and unable to work with an Assembly dominated by reactionary forces due to the censitary nature of the electoral system, Cuza launched a coup d'etat, followed by a constitutional referendum that replaced the Convention of Paris, an act that served as the constitution of the country, with his own version named the Statute expanding the Paris Convention (). The new constitution created the Senate for serving Cuza's legislative purposes and vested the office of the Prince with full executive authority, while the Prime Minister remained his subordinate. Even though Cuza now had plenary powers, the office the Prime Minister remained influent, and Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, the 3rd Prime Minister, a liberal and former ally of Cuza often clashed with him. After Cuza's removal by coup d'etat in 1866 by a coalition formed by both members of the liberal and conservative factions, the political forces of the time settled on two objectives: bringing a foreign prince from a European noble family on the country's throne and drafting a liberal constitution. The 1866 Constitution confirmed that the Prime Minister served at the pleasure of the Prince, the latter being able to appoint and dismiss the former at any time and for any reason. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister still held considerable influence. After World War I led to the creation of Greater Romania another constitution was drafted in 1923 to reflect the changes the Romanian state had undergone since the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Trianon. The new constitution limited the powers of the King, vesting the executive power entirely in the Prime Minister and his Cabinet who now governed in the King's name after the latter appointed him. The new constitution also made the first steps towards a parliamentary control of the government, stipulating that either of the chambers may put ministers under accusation to stand trial.

Early life Browne was born on 3 July 1807 in Aylesbury, in the county of Buckinghamshire, England, a son of Robert Browne and Sarah Dorothea . Of Irish extraction, the family had a military or church tradition; his father was a colonel in the Buckinghamshire Militia while his younger brother, Harold Browne, later became Bishop of Winchester. Military career In 1824, Browne kept up his family's military tradition and joined the British Army as an ensign in the 44th Regiment of Foot. After four years, he transferred into the 28th Regiment of Foot. In 1832, and now a captain, he was appointed aide-de-camp to Baron Nugent, the High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. He served in this role for three years, which included a spell as colonial secretary. Now a major, Browne was posted to the 41st Regiment of Foot. In 1842, the regiment was dispatched to Afghanistan and fought in the First Anglo-Afghan War. He led the regiment for a time and commanded the rearguard as the British Army retreated from Khyber Pass into India. After his return from the campaign in Afghanistan, Browne was promoted lieutenant-colonel. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In 1849, he exchanged into the 21st Regiment of Foot. Browne retired from the British Army on half-pay in 1851 and shortly took up an appointment as Governor of the island of Saint Helena. He served in this capacity from July 1851 to December 1854, and during this time worked towards improving the island's water supply.  Marriage  In 1851 Browne married Harriet Louisa Campbell. His wife was a considerable support to his political career. She was over 20 years his junior and was well read, socially accomplished with a pleasant personality, and had an excellent understanding of the political environment in which she and her husband circulated. In addition to her influence over Browne, her hospitality and contribution to the social and cultural life during Browne's placements assisted him in influencing others to support his political views. Governor of New Zealand In September 1855, Browne was appointed Governor of New Zealand, replacing Administrator Robert Wynyard. His handling of MƒÅori land issues were a contributing factor in the outbreak of the First Taranaki War in a new phase of the New Zealand Wars: despite divisions among Waitara MƒÅori over the ownership of land, Browne persisted with the purchase of the disputed Pekapeka block, further inflaming tensions between MƒÅori and British settlers. On 5 March 1860, Browne ordered the military occupation of the land, leading to the outbreak of war twelve days later. The following year, he negotiated a truce to end the fighting in the region. His governorship term ended in May 1861; rather than extend it, the Colonial Office in London replaced him with Sir George Grey. The town of Gore, New Zealand was named after him. Governor of Tasmania In December 1861, Browne was appointed Governor of Tasmania. At the time, Tasmania was struggling economically and people were leaving for better employment prospects on the Australian mainland. To counter this, Browne implemented measures to encourage immigration. He also worked towards improving public education and training in the trades. A popular governor for most of his term, he lost goodwill when he displayed favouritism when filling a public service position. In January 1869, he left Australia for England. While in Melbourne, his point of departure from the country, his youngest child died. Later life After being appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1869, Browne, with the assistance of Edward Cardwell, the Secretary of State for War, was appointed Administrator of Bermuda. This was to help secure Browne a pension and he served in this capacity from May 1870 to April 1871. Brown died in London on 17 April 1887. He was survived by his wife, Harriet Louisa Browne . The couple had several children; the eldest son, Harold Browne, also served in the British Army and fought in the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1900, and took part in the defence of Ladysmith. His daughter, Ethel, married Hugh Locke King who built the Brooklands motor racing circuit in England, while his youngest son, Wilfrid was the first Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman in South Africa.

After hearing the evidence and often jury instructions from the judge, the group retires for deliberation, to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or supermajority. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury. The size of the jury varies; in criminal cases involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors, although Scotland uses 15. A number of countries that are not in the English common law tradition have quasi-juries on which lay judges or jurors and professional judges deliberate together regarding criminal cases. However, the common law trial jury is the most common type of jury system. In civil cases many trials require fewer than twelve jurors. Juries are almost never used in civil cases outside the United States and Canada. Other states with a common law tradition sometimes use them in defamation cases, in cases involving a governmental eminent domain power, and in cases involving alleged wrongful conviction. Civil law countries generally do not use civil juries. Civil juries are available in the United States and Canada in almost all cases where the only remedy sought is money damages.

In a regular (kesidran) year, Marcheshvan has 29 days, but because of the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, in some years, an additional day is added to Marcheshvan to make the year a \\"full\\" (maleh) year. Marcheshvan is an autumn month which occurs in October‚ÄìNovember in the Gregorian calendar. The Hebrew Bible, before the Babylonian Exile, refers to the month as Bul (). In Sidon, the reference to Bul is also made on the Sarcophaugus of Eshmunazar II dated to the early 5th century BC.

Bahab, or in Hebrew , stands for 2, 5, 2, i.e., Monday (2nd day of the week), Thursday (5th day), and another Monday. On the Monday, Thursday, and second Monday after the Sabbath, the minhag is to fast and/or to recite penitential prayers called Selichot. According to Minhag Ashkenaz, the second Monday of Bahab is the Monday before Rosh Chodesh Kislev, the Thursday is the Thursday preceding that, the first Monday is the Monday preceding that, and the Sabbath in which the prayer is recited is the Sabbath preceding that. Bahab is also observed at the beginning of Iyar. * Sigd ‚Äì The Ethiopian Jewish community celebrates Sigd on the 29th day of Marcheshvan, 50 days from Yom Kippur, analogous to counting 50 days from Pesach to Shavuos.

In pre-modern societies, all legal protection was withdrawn from the criminal, so that anyone is legally empowered to persecute or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In early Germanic law, the death penalty is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from Roman law, as the status of homo sacer, and persisted throughout the Middle Ages. In the common law of England, a \\"Writ of Outlawry\\" made the pronouncement Caput lupinum (\\"Let his be a wolf's head\\", literally \\"May he bear a wolfish head\\") with respect to its subject, using \\"head\\" to refer to the entire person (cf. \\"per capita\\") and equating that person with a wolf in the eyes of the law: not only was the subject deprived of all legal rights of the law being outside the \\"law\\", but others could kill him on sight as if he were a wolf or other wild animal. Women were declared \\"waived\\" rather than outlawed but it was effectively the same punishment. Legal history =Ancient Rome= Among other forms of exile, Roman law included the penalty of interdicere aquae et ignis (\\"to forbid water and fire\\"). People so penalized were required to leave Roman territory and forfeit their property. If they returned, they were effectively outlaws; providing them the use of fire or water was illegal, and they could be killed at will without legal penalty. Interdicere aquae et ignis was traditionally imposed by the tribune of the plebs, and is attested to have been in use during the First Punic War of the third century BC by Cato the Elder. It was later also applied by many other officials, such as the Senate, magistrates, and Julius Caesar as a general and provincial governor during the Gallic Wars.Caesar, Julius. De Bello Gallico, book VI, section XLIV. It fell out of use during the early Empire. =England= A statue of Robin Hood, a heroic outlaw in English folklore In English common law, an outlaw was a person who had defied the laws of the realm, by such acts as ignoring a summons to court, or fleeing instead of appearing to plead when charged with a crime. The earliest reference to outlawry in English legal texts appears in the 8th century. Criminal The term outlawry referred to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside the sphere of legal protection. In the common law of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system, since the outlaw could not use the legal system for protection, e.g. from mob justice. To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of civil or social death. The outlaw was debarred from all civilized society. No one was allowed to give him food, shelter, or any other sort of support‚Äîto do so was to commit the crime of aiding and abetting, and to be in danger of the ban oneself. A more recent concept of \\"wanted dead or alive\\" is similar, but implies that a trial is desired (namely if the wanted person is returned alive), whereas outlawry precludes a trial. Henry Danvers, Earl of Danby, was outlawed in 1597 by a coroner's court for the murder of Henry Long. He went to France and joined the French army; two years later he was pardoned by Queen Elizabeth and returned to England. An outlaw might be killed with impunity; and it was not only lawful but meritorious to kill a thief fleeing from justice‚Äîto do so was not murder. A man who slew a thief was expected to declare the fact without delay, otherwise the dead man's kindred might clear his name by their oath and require the slayer to pay weregild as for a true man. By the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime for which he was an outlaw. If a man was accused of a treason or felony but failed to appear in court to defend himself, he was deemed to be convicted of the said offence.Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (30th ed., 1938) p. 71 If he was accused of a misdemeanour, then he was guilty of a serious contempt of court which was itself a capital crime. In the context of criminal law, outlawry faded out, not so much by legal changes as by the greater population density of the country, which made it harder for wanted fugitives to evade capture; and by the adoption of international extradition pacts. It was obsolete by the time the offence was abolished in 1938.Archbold (30th ed., 1938) p. 71Archbold (31st ed., 1943) p. 98Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1938, section 12 Outlawry was, however, a living practice as of 1855: in 1841, William John Bankes, who had previously been an MP for several different constituencies between 1810 and 1835, was outlawed by due process of law for absenting himself from trial for homosexuality, and died in 1855 in Venice as an outlaw. Civil There was also a doctrine of civil outlawry. Civil outlawry did not carry the sentence of capital punishment. It was however imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions like debts or torts. The punishments for civil outlawry were nevertheless harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw.William Blackstone (1753), Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book 3, Chapter XIX \\"Of Process\\" In the civil context, outlawry became obsolescent in civil procedure by reforms that no longer required summoned defendants to appear and plead. Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of civil duty continued to exist in English law until 1879 and, in Scots law until the late 1940s. Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the plaintiff, and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply. =In other countries= Erik the Red was outlawed by the Icelandic Althing for three years (so in about 982 he went viking and explored Greenland). In 1878, Ned Kelly and his gang of bushrangers were outlawed by the Government of Victoria, Australia Outlawry also existed in other ancient legal codes, such as the ancient Norse and Icelandic legal code. In early modern times, the term Vogelfrei and its cognates came to be used in Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia, referring to a person stripped of his civil rights being \\"free\\" for the taking like a bird.Schmidt‚ÄìWiegand, Ruth (1998). \\"Vogelfrei\\". Handw√∂rterbuch der Deutschen Rechtsgeschichte [Dictionary of the History of German Law]. 5: Straftheorie [Penal theory]. Berlin: Schmidt. pp. 930‚Äì32. In Germany and Slavic countries in 15th‚Äì19th centuries groups of outlaws composed from former prisoners, soldiers etc. became an important social phenomenon. They lived off robbery and their activity was often supported by local inhabitants from lower classes. The best known are Juraj J√°no≈°√≠k and Jakub Surovec in Slovakia, Oleksa Dovbush in Ukraine, R√≥zsa S√°ndor in Hungary, Schinderhannes and Hans Kohlhase in Germany. The concept of outlawry was reintroduced to British law by several Australian colonial governments in the late 19th century to deal with the menace of bushranging. The Felons Apprehension Act (1865) of New South Wales provided that a judge could, upon proof of sufficiently notorious conduct, issue a special bench warrant requiring a person to submit themselves to police custody before a given date, or be declared an outlaw. An outlawed person could be apprehended \\"alive or dead\\" by any of the Queen's subjects, \\"whether a constable or not\\", and without \\"being accountable for using of any deadly weapon in aid of such apprehension.\\" Similar provisions were passed in Victoria and Queensland. Although the provisions of the New South Wales Felons Apprehension Act were not exercised after the end of the bushranging era, they remained on the statute book until 1976. The Third Reich made extensive use of outlawry in the persecution of Jews or other persons deemed undesirable to the state. As a political weapon Napoleon Bonaparte on HMS Bellerophon after his surrender to the British in 1815. There have been many instances in military and/or political conflicts throughout history whereby one side declares the other as being \\"illegal\\", notorious cases being the use of proscription in the civil wars of the Roman Republic. In later times there was the notable case of Napoleon Bonaparte whom the Congress of Vienna, on 13 March 1815, declared he had \\"deprived himself of the protection of the law\\".Timeline: The Congress of Vienna, the Hundred Days, and Napoleon's Exile on St Helena, Center of Digital Initiatives, Brown University Library In modern times, the government of the First Spanish Republic, unable to reduce the Cantonal rebellion centered in Cartagena, Spain, declared the Cartagena fleet to be \\"piratic\\", which allowed any nation to prey on it. Taking the opposite road, some outlaws became political leaders, such as Ethiopia's Kassa Hailu who became Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia. Rubenson, King of Kings, pp. 36‚Äì39 Popular usage Though the judgment of outlawry is now obsolete (even though it inspired the pro forma Outlawries Bill which is still to this day introduced in the British House of Commons during the State Opening of Parliament), romanticised outlaws became stock characters in several fictional settings. This was particularly so in the United States, where outlaws were popular subjects of newspaper coverage and stories in the 19th century, and 20th century fiction and Western movies. Thus, \\"outlaw\\" is still commonly used to mean those violating the lawBlack's Law Dictionary at 1255 (4th ed. 1951), citing Oliveros v. Henderson, 116 S.C. 77, 106 S.E. 855, 859. or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to \\"law-and-order\\" notions of conformity and authority (such as the \\"outlaw country\\" music movement in the 1970s).

He served as Surveyor General of New South Wales and is perhaps best known for his two expeditions into the interior of New South Wales and his exploration of the Tweed River and the Brisbane River in what is now the state of Queensland.  Early life  John Oxley was born at Kirkham Abbey near Westow in Yorkshire, Great Britain. He was baptised at Bulmer on 6 July 1784, his parents recorded as John and Arabella Oxley.Ancestry.com. England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2014.  Naval career  In 1799 (aged 15), he entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman on the . He travelled to Australia in October 1802 as master's mate of the naval vessel , which carried out coastal surveying (including the survey of Western Port), and this first stay in the Colonies would last for five years. In 1805 Governor King appointed him acting lieutenant in charge of the Buffalo. In 1806 (aged 22) he commanded the Estramina on a trip to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania). He returned to England in 1807 and from there he was appointed first lieutenant of , a British sloop of war that was stationed at NSW. To take up this appointment he sailed out again to NSW, traveling as agent for the Transport Board in the convict ship Speke, arriving in November 1808 and in which he shipped goods worth ¬£800 as an investment. In 1809 Porpoise visited Van Diemen's Land, carrying as a passenger Governor William Bligh, who had been deposed in the Rum Rebellion. During the period in which he'd returned to England, Oxley had obtained an order from the Colonial Office for a land grant of near the Nepean River, but Lieutenant-Governor Paterson granted him more - . Oxley had to surrender this land in 1810, (everyone given land grants since Bligh's deposing was required to surrender their land) but Governor Macquarie then granted him near Camden which he increased in 1815 to again. This he called 'Kirkham'. In 1810 he wrote a lengthy report on the settlements in Van Diemen's Land before returning again to England, in Porpoise, in May. Back in London he applied for the post of Naval Officer in Sydney, and then, after paying Charles Grimes to resign, according to John Macarthur, he twice sought the post of Surveyor-General. When Bligh was deposed, Oxley had denied that he had been a partisan of Macarthur, (Macarthur being ordered to England for court-martial) but his letters show that he was on very intimate terms with Macarthur, the leader of the anti-Bligh faction. In 1812 he became engaged to Elizabeth Macarthur, daughter of John Macarthur; this was broken off when her father discovered the extent of Oxley's debts.  Surveyor General  By that time, through the influence of Macarthur's friend Walter Davidson, Oxley's second application for the NSW surveyor-generalship had been successful. In 1811 he retired from the navy, and in May 1812 sailed for Sydney, for the third time, in the Minstrel to take up his new duties as Surveyor-General, even though he had no land mapping experience at all. Oxley's appointment was at the time of Lachlan Macquarie's Governorship. Macquarie encouraged exploration ‚Äì he had sent George Evans to confirm the exploratory work of Wentworth, Blaxland and Lawson over the Blue Mountains, instigated the building of the road over the Blue Mountains in 1814‚Äì1815, and had travelled to Bathurst immediately William Cox had completed it. From there he had sent George Evans on an expedition of exploration up the Lachlan River in May 1815. Now Macquarie wanted the Lachlan and Macquarie River explored thoroughly. Opening up of the new lands over the mountains had created enthusiasm for further discoveries about them and the Macquarie River. Mysteriously, the Macquarie and the Lachlan flowed westwards to the interior of the country and not easterly towards the coastline. Successively, in 1817 and 1818 Governor Macquarie appointed John Oxley in charge of two expeditions to investigate these rivers. On the 1817 Lachlan expedition, Oxley was to come across marshy country and conclude this inland area was uninhabitable. If he had pressed on for two more days he would have reached the Murrumbidgee River. Oxley reported that, in his opinion, the Lachlan flowed into an extensive series of swamps, \\"which were, perhaps, the margin of a great inland sea.\\" Similarly, the Macquarie expedition the following year in 1818 came to a halt on that river at the Macquarie Marshes in a good season for the marshes as the Macquarie was in flood replenishing these vital wetlands. Oxley tried hard to proceed through them but couldn't do so. He returned to the encampment of the rest of his party now convinced that these westward flowing rivers terminated in an inland sea, and he had been on the swampy edge of it. Through Oxley, the theory of the Australian inland sea was fed and perpetuated, =Lachlan River expedition, 1817= 1817 and 1818 Expeditions of Oxley In March 1817 John Oxley was instructed to take charge of an expedition to explore and survey the course of the Lachlan River. He left Sydney on 6 April 1817 with George Evans as second-in-command, and Allan Cunningham as a botanist. The previous year, Evans had accompanied Macquarie over the Blue Mountains to Bathurst on the celebratory completion of Cox's road, where Macquarie had directed him on an exploratory journey which resulted in Evans reaching and naming the Lachlan River west of Bathurst in May 1815. The party also included William Parr as a mineralogist and draftsman. Oxley's party reached Bathurst after a week, where they were briefly detained by bad weather. On 25 April 1817, they reached the Lachlan River Depot which had been prepared for them (with provisions and supplies) in advance by a separate party under the direction of William Cox. From here, they commenced following its course, with part of the stores being conveyed in boats. As the exploring party travelled westward the country surrounding the rising river was found to be increasingly inundated. On 12 May, west of the present township of Forbes, they found their progress impeded by an extensive marsh. They travelled down a northern branch of the river to Mt Mulguthery where they were forced to return up the river. After retracing their route for a short distance they then proceeded in a south-westerly direction through Ungarie and past Weethalle, intending to travel overland to the southern Australian coastline. By the end of May, the party found themselves in a dry scrubby country northeast of Yenda where they ascended several peaks in the Cocoparra National Park. Shortage of water and the death of two horses forced Oxley's return, passing near Rankins Springs to the Lachlan River. On 23 June the Lachlan River near Merrigal Bridge was reached: \\"we suddenly came upon the banks of the river‚Ä¶ which we had quitted nearly five weeks before\\". They followed the course of the Lachlan River through Hillston and Booligal for a fortnight. The party encountered much-flooded country and reached a point 5 km south-west of Booligal which was their last campsite. On 7 July Oxley proceeded another 16 km along the flooded river and recorded that \\"it was with infinite regret and pain that I was forced to conclude, that the interior of this vast country is a marsh and uninhabitable\\". Oxley resolved to turn back and after resting for two days the exploring party began to retrace their steps along the Lachlan River. They left the Lachlan at Kiacatoo up-stream of the present site of Lake Cargelligo and crossed to the Bogan River and then across to the Wellington Valley on the upper waters of the Macquarie River, which they followed back to Bathurst (arriving on 29 August 1817). The Wellington Valley would later be made the site of a convict settlement mostly for convict 'specials'. =Macquarie River expedition, 1818= Although disappointed by his Lachlan expedition, in not following the river all the way to its end, John Oxley took up Macquarie's next directive to explore the Macquarie River. He departed from Bathurst on 28 May 1818 with an exploration party that comprised Deputy Surveyor General George Evans, Oxley's friend Dr John Harris, a botanist named Charles Frazer, and twelve convict men.Hambleton, Martin \\"The Story of Australia\\" published The Sunday Mail, 16 September 1934. The names of the twelve convict men were later recorded by Governor Macquarie in his diary, upon the party's eventual return to Sydney. \\"The following are their Names: William Warner, Patrick Byrne, James Blake, George Simpson, James Williams, John Williams, Francis Lloyd, Barnard Butler, Thomas Ellis, John Dwyer, Richard Watts, Henry Shippey.\\"'Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Archive', Friday 27th Nov1 1818, Macquarie University, Macquarie, He also noted that the first five men listed had also been with Oxley on the previous year's 1817 exploratory journey to the Lachlan. They also took boats with them and nearly two dozen horses. The party would get upriver to the Macquarie Marshes, turn north-east to the Warrumbungle mountains crossing the Castlereagh River in the process, view the rich Liverpool Plains, come across the Peel River and the Hastings River to reach the NSW coast and the site of present-day Port Macquarie. These European sightings delivered a real boost to the NSW colony. On 12 June 1818 Oxley was near the site that would become Dubbo. He wrote that he had passed that day 'over a very beautiful country, thinly wooded and apparently safe from the highest floods...'. they continued to follow the Macquarie River through land that became increasingly flat. On 27 June they spotted a small hill and named it Mt Harris in honour of John Harris accompanying him. On the same day the mountains in the distance to the east (now known by their Aboriginal name, the Warrumbungles) were named Arbuthnot's Ranges for the Rt Hon C. Arbuthnot of H.M. Treasury.Oxley, John \\"Journal of An Expedition in Australia. Pt II.\\" Published by John Murray, London 1820. Accessed 21 April 2018 Mt Harris is 54 km N-NW of present-day Warren. They continued by boat and horses until they reached the Macquarie Marshes where it spread out through the reeds and Oxley was unable to locate the course of the river any further downstream. He wrote: \\"But if an opinion may be permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances, mine is decidedly in favour of our being in the immediate vicinity of an inland sea, or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually filling up by numerous depositions from the high lands, left by waters which flow into it.\\" From here he retraced steps to Mt Harris, NW of present-day Warren, and camped from early July while he sent George Evans forward with a few men to scout a route to the north-east. On Evans' return, the expedition crossed the river that Oxley would name the Castlereagh, went towards the Warrumbungle Mountains, which he named at the time 'Arbuthnot's Range' and easterly through the Gooriananwa GapE.W. Dunlop, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol 2 1967, 'Oxley, John Joseph'. Accessed 20 April 2018 From here they moved forward to come upon the rich soil of the Liverpool Plains. On 26 August 1818 they climbed a hill and saw before them rich, fertile land (Peel River), near the present site of Tamworth. Continuing further east they crossed the Great Dividing Range passing by the Apsley Falls on 13 September 1818 which Oxley named the Bathurst Falls. He described it as \\"one of the most magnificent waterfalls we have seen\\". Upon reaching the Hastings River the exploring party followed it to its mouth, discovering that it flowed into the sea at a spot which Oxley named Port Macquarie. In his diary of 27 November 1818, Governor Macquarie listed the twelve men who accompanied Oxley and Evans on this expedition (see above). He wrote: \\"I inspected and spoke to the 12 Men who Accompanied Mr. Oxley on his last Expedition ‚Äì and in his own presence returned them my thanks for their steady good and obedient Conduct on the Expedition; and being all Convicts I have promised to give them Conditional Pardons as a reward for their good behaviour.\\"'Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Archive', Friday 27 November 1818, Macquarie University, Macquarie, =Oxley's 1823 expedition to Brisbane River= John Oxley Monument, North Quay, Brisbane In 1823, Governor Brisbane sent Oxley north by boat in search of a site for an alternative penal settlement for the most difficult convicts. On this journey, he visited the Tweed River and valley and was deeply impressed, recording his impressions as follows: \\"A deep rich valley clothed with magnificent trees, the beautiful uniformity of which was only interrupted by the turns and windings of the river, which here and there appeared like small lakes. The background was Mt. Warning. The view was altogether beautiful beyond description. The scenery here exceeded anything I have previously seen in Australia.\\" As Surveyor General, Oxley made a close examination of the Tweed River and Port Curtis, and sources connected that investigation, principally the manuscript journal kept by Oxley, and the published Narrative of John Uniack, who accompanied Oxley. Oxley sailed northwards from the Tweed Area in the . Rounding Moreton Island, he came across two escaped convicts who had been living with the Aboriginal people there. With their assistance, he was shown, and named, the Brisbane River. He recommend this place for the site of the convict settlement, which became Moreton Bay, and later the city of Brisbane. A monument was built at North Quay in 1924 to commemorate the site of his landing in Brisbane. He then travelled further north to explore Port Curtis (the site of Gladstone) and continued to explore the region, which is now known as South East Queensland. In 1824 Oxley, accompanied by Allan Cunningham returned to the Brisbane River and, travelling further up, then located the Bremer River.  Personal life  Request for leave due to illness dated 5 July 1824 Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted Oxley near Camden in 1810, which he increased to in 1815. He named this property Kirkham and raised and bred sheep there. He was also briefly a director of the Bank of New South Wales. He was one of five members of the original 1824 New South Wales Legislative Council, but was not reappointed when the Council was reconstituted in 1825. Oxley had three daughters out of wedlock with two women, before he married a third woman. Two of these daughters were with Charlotte Thorpe and born before his inland expeditions: Jeanette b. 1813NSWBDM index V1813205 7 \\"Oxley, JENNET to John/ Charlotte\\" (never married) who died in 1875NSWBDM death index 3449/1875 \\"Oxley, Jeannette, d.o John, Died Woollahra\\" and is buried in the historic cemetery at South Head, and Frances b. 1815NSWBDM index V18153503 1A \\"Oxley, Frances, to John/Charlotte (Thorp)\\" who married William Waugh and is buried in Tenterfield.

Emma had followed her brother out to New South Wales from Sussex after he had established himself as an attorney in the colony. Oxley and Emma Norton had a daughter and two sons. The elder, John Norton Oxley became a Member of the Legislative Assembly, representing the Western Division of Camden, in the first Parliament after the establishment of responsible government in 1856. He sponsored the Broad Gauge Act which encouraged the use of wagons with broad wheels instead of narrow-tired drays in order to cause less wear on public roads; this measure made him unpopular with the farmers and carriers in his electorate and he lost his seat. The younger son, Henry Oxley, also became a Member of the Legislative Assembly, representing the Electoral district of Camden between 1859 and 1860. Oxley suffered with illness throughout his service, caused by the difficulties of his expeditions. He finally succumbed to his illness and died on 25 May 1828 at his Kirkham property, Kirkham, New South Wales, outside Camden, aged 44.

Description These dainty birds are intermediate between Old World warblers and wrens in their structure and habits, moving restlessly through foliage seeking insects. The gnatcatchers are mainly soft bluish grey in colour, and have the typical insectivore's long sharp bill. Many species have distinctive black head patterns (especially males) and long, regularly cocked, black-and-white tails. The skulking gnatwrens are browner, more thickset, and with proportionally shorter tails and longer bills. Distribution and habitat They are distributed from North to South America, with the exception of the far south and high Andean regions. Gnatwrens typically occur in the undergrowth of dense, often humid, forest, while gnatcatchers, depending on the species involved, occur in anything from dry scrubby habitats (e.g. the California gnatcatcher) to the canopy of humid Amazonian forest (e.g. the Guianan gnatcatcher).

It is a summer month of 29 days. Elul usually occurs in August‚ÄìSeptember on the Gregorian calendar. Etymology The name of the month Elul, like the names of the rest of the Hebrew calendar months, was brought from the Babylonian captivity, and originated from the Akkadian word for \\"harvest\\". A similar month name was also used in Akkadian, in the form El≈´lu. The month is known as Ara·∏´ Ul≈´lu, \\"harvest month\\", in the Babylonian calendar. Eyl√ºl is also the name for September in Turkish; this is derived from  æAyl≈´l, used in Iraq and the Levant (see Arabic names of calendar months). Customs In Jewish tradition, the month of Elul is a time of repentance in preparation for the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The word \\"Elul\\" is similar to the root of the verb \\"search\\" in Aramaic. Jewish sources from the 14th century and on write that the Hebrew word \\"Elul\\" can be understood to be an acronym for the phrase \\"Ani L'dodi V'dodi Li\\" ‚Äì \\"I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine\\". Elul is seen as a time to search one's heart and draw close to God in preparation for the coming Day of Judgement, Rosh Hashanah, and Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi compared, by way of analogy, the month of Elul to a king visiting his peasants in the field before returning to his palace. During the month of Elul, there are a number of special rituals leading up to the High Holy Days. It is customary to blow the shofar every morning (except on Shabbat) from Rosh Hodesh Elul (the first day of the month) until the day before Rosh Hashanah. The blasts are meant to awaken one's spirits and inspire him to begin the soul searching which will prepare him for the High Holy Days. As part of this preparation, Elul is the time to begin the sometimes-difficult process of granting and asking for forgiveness. It is also customary to recite Psalm 27 every day from Rosh Hodesh Elul through Hoshanah Rabbah on Sukkot (in Tishrei). Aside from the blowing of the shofar, the other significant ritual practice during Elul is to recite selichot (special penitential prayers) either every morning before sunrise beginning on the Sunday immediately before Rosh Hashanah, or, if starting Sunday would not afford four days of selichot, then the Sunday one week prior (Ashkenazi tradition) or every morning during the entire month of Elul (Sephardi tradition). Ashkenazi Jews begin the recitation of selichot with a special service on Saturday night between solar mid-night (not 12:00) and morning light on the first day of Selichot. Many Jews also visit the graves of loved ones throughout the month in order to remember and honor those people in our past who inspire us to live more fully in the future. Another social custom is to begin or end all letters written during the month of Elul with wishes that the recipient have a good year. The standard blessing is \\"K'tiva VaHatima Tova\\" (\\"a good writing and sealing [of judgement]\\"), meaning that the person should be written and sealed in the Book of Life for a good year. Tradition teaches that on Rosh Hashanah, each person is written down for a good or a poor year, based on their actions in the previous one, and their sincere efforts at atoning for mistakes or harm. On Yom Kippur, that fate is \\"sealed.\\" Elul in Jewish history * 1 Elul (1313 BCE) ‚Äì Moses ascends Mount Sinai for 3rd 40 days * 1 Elul (520 BCE) ‚Äì The Prophet Haggai commands that the rebuilding of the Second Temple continue * 2 Elul (1555) ‚Äì Shulchan Aruch published * 3 Elul (1935) ‚Äì Death of Abraham Isaac Kook * 5 Elul ‚Äì Ezekiel the prophet has a prophecy of the destruction of Solomon's Temple * 10 Elul (2105 BCE) ‚Äì Noah dispatches raven * 12 Elul (1294) ‚Äì Birth of Nachmanides * 12 Elul (1945) ‚Äì Rabbi Shlomo Zev Zweigenhaft publicly performs the first shechitah on German soil since it was outlawed by the Nazis in 1933.Hapardes Rabbinical Monthly Journal Volume 19 Issue 7 October 1945 Page 7 (retrieved July 19, 2020) * 13 Elul (1909) ‚Äì Death of Yosef Hayyim * 17 Elul (2105 BCE) ‚Äì Noah dispatches dove * 18 Elul (1609) ‚Äì Death of Judah Loew ben Bezalel * 18 Elul (1698) ‚Äì Birth of Baal Shem Tov * 18 Elul (1745) ‚Äì Birth of rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi * 23 Elul (2105 BCE) ‚Äì Dove brings olive Leaf to Noah * 23 Elul (1942) ‚Äì Death of the Grand Rabbi of Aleksander, Yitzchak Menachem Danziger, in Treblinka * 24 Elul (1933) ‚Äì Death of Israel Meir Kagan * 25 Elul (3761 BCE) ‚Äì The 1st day of the world according to the Genesis creation narrative * 25 Elul (335 BCE) ‚Äì Jerusalem Walls Rebuilt * 25 Elul (2nd century CE) ‚Äì Death of Eleazar ben Simeon, son of Simeon bar Yochai * 27 Elul (1855 CE) ‚Äì Death of Sholom Rokeach * 28 Elul (1983 CE) ‚Äì Death of Rabbi Yoel Halpern * 29 Elul (1789 CE) ‚Äì Birth of Menachem Mendel Schneersohn See also * Repentance in Judaism * Rosh Hashanah LaBehema * Song of Songs References External links * Dates of Elul * Resources on the Month of Elul * The month of Elul * An in-depth discussion of the tradition of hearing shofar on Elul, plus meditations on the sound of shofar for each day of the month, can be found at The Shofar of Elul * Jewels of Elul: A reading for each day of Elul from a diverse background of Jewish sources.

Struck from 1817 until the present time, it was originally a circulating coin accepted in Britain and elsewhere in the world; it is now a bullion coin and is sometimes mounted in jewellery. In most recent years, it has borne the design of Saint George and the Dragon on the reverse; the initials () of the designer, Benedetto Pistrucci, are visible to the right of the date. The coin was named after the English gold sovereign, last minted about 1603, and originated as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816. Many in Parliament believed a one-pound coin should be issued rather than the 21-shilling (¬£1.05) guinea struck until that time. The Master of the Mint, William Wellesley Pole, had Pistrucci design the new coin, and his depiction was also used for other gold coins. Originally, the coin was unpopular as the public preferred the convenience of banknotes, but paper currency of value ¬£1 was soon limited by law. With that competition gone, the sovereign not only became a popular circulating coin, but was used in international trade and in foreign lands, trusted as a coin containing a known quantity of gold. The British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade, and the Royal Mint took steps to see that lightweight gold coins were withdrawn from circulation. From the 1850s until 1932, the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints, initially in Australia, and later in Canada, South Africa and India‚Äîthey have been struck again in India since 2013 (in addition to the production in Britain by the Royal Mint) for the local market. The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design, but by 1887, all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci's George and Dragon design. Strikings there were so large that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia. With the start of the First World War in 1914, the sovereign vanished from circulation in Britain, replaced by paper money, and it did not return after the war, though issues at colonial mints continued until 1932. The coin was still used in the Middle East, and demand rose in the 1950s, which the Royal Mint eventually responded to by striking new sovereigns in 1957. It has been struck since then both as a bullion coin and, beginning in 1979, for collectors. Though the sovereign is no longer in circulation, it is still legal tender in the United Kingdom. Background and authorisation Sovereign of Queen Mary I, c. 1553 There had been an English coin known as the sovereign, first authorised by Henry VII in 1489. It had a diameter of , and weighed 15.55 grams (0.500 oz t), twice the weight of the existing gold coin, the ryal. The new coin was struck in response to a large influx of gold into Europe from West Africa in the 1480s, and Henry at first called it the double ryal, but soon changed the name to sovereign. Too great in value to have any practical use in circulation, the original sovereign likely served as a presentation piece to be given to dignitaries. The English sovereign, the country's first coin to be valued at one pound, was struck by the monarchs of the 16th century, the size and fineness often being altered. James I, when he came to the English throne in 1603, issued a sovereign in the year of his accession, but the following year, soon after he proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, he issued a proclamation for a new twenty-shilling piece. About ten per cent lighter than the final sovereigns, the new coin was called the unite, symbolising that James had merged the Scottish and English crowns. In the 1660s, following the Restoration of Charles II and the mechanisation of the Royal Mint that quickly followed, a new twenty-shilling gold coin was issued. It had no special name at first but the public soon nicknamed it the guinea and this became the accepted term. Coins were at the time valued by their precious metal content, and the price of gold relative to silver rose soon after the guinea's issuance. Thus, it came to trade at 21 shillings or even sixpence more. Popular in commerce, the coin's value was set by the government at 21 shillings in silver in 1717, and was subject to revision downwards, though in practice this did not occur. The term sovereign, referring to a coin, fell from use‚Äîit does not appear in Samuel Johnson's dictionary, compiled in the 1750s. A ¬£1 note issued in 1814 by the Gloucester Old Bank The British economy was disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars, and gold was hoarded. Among the measures taken to allow trade to continue was the issue of one-pound banknotes. The public came to like them as more convenient than the odd-value guinea. After the war, Parliament, by the Coinage Act 1816, placed Britain officially on the gold standard, with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea. Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike. A committee of the Privy Council recommended gold coins of ten shillings, twenty shillings, two pounds and five pounds be issued, and this was accepted by George, Prince Regent on 3 August 1816. The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of the old name possibly promoted by antiquarians with numismatic interests.  Creation  1817 sovereign of George III William Wellesley Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington, was appointed Master of the Mint (at that time a junior government position) in 1812, with a mandate to reform the Royal Mint. Pole had favoured retaining the guinea, due to the number extant and the amount of labour required to replace them with sovereigns. Formal instruction to the Mint came with an indenture dated February 1817, directing the Royal Mint to strike gold coins weighing 7.988 grams, that is to say, the new sovereign. The Italian sculptor Benedetto Pistrucci came to London early in 1816. His talent opened the doors of the capital's elite, among them Lady Spencer, who showed Pistrucci a model in wax of Saint George and the Dragon by Nathaniel Marchant and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style as part of her husband's regalia as a Knight of the Garter. Pistrucci had already been thinking of such a work, and he produced the cameo. The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet's Hotel in Leicester Square, where he had stayed after coming to London. In 1816, Pole hired Pistrucci to create models for the new coinage. After completing Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci suggested to Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign would be Saint George. He created a head, in jasper, of King George III, to be used as model for the sovereign and the smaller silver coins. He had prepared a model in wax of Saint George and the Dragon for use on the crown; this was adapted for the sovereign. The Royal Mint's engravers were not able to successfully reproduce Pistrucci's imagery in steel, and the sculptor undertook the engraving of the dies himself. = Pistrucci's George and Dragon design = Pistrucci's original sketch for the sovereign Pistrucci's design for the reverse of the sovereign features Saint George on horseback. His left hand clutches the rein of the horse's bridle, and he does not wear armour, other than on his lower legs and feet, with his toes bare. Further protection is provided by the helmet, with, on early issues, a streamer or plume of hair floating behind. Also flowing behind the knight is his chlamys, or cloak; it is fastened in front by a fibula. George's right shoulder bears a baltens for suspending the gladius, the sword that he grasps in his right hand. He is otherwise naked‚Äîthe art critic John Ruskin later considered it odd that the saint should be unclothed going into such a violent encounter. The saint's horse appears to be half attacking, half shrinking from the dragon, which lies wounded by George's spear and in the throes of death. The sovereign replaced the guinea. The original 1817 design had the saintly knight still carrying part of the broken spear. This was changed to a sword when the garter that originally surrounded the design was eliminated in 1821, and George is intended to have broken his spear earlier in the encounter with the dragon. Also removed in 1821 was the plume of hair, or streamer, behind George's helmet; it was restored in 1887, modified in 1893 and 1902, and eliminated in 2009. The George and Dragon design is in the Neoclassical style. When Pistrucci created the coin, Neoclassicism was all the rage in London, and he may have been inspired by the Elgin Marbles, which were exhibited from 1807, and which he probably saw soon after his arrival in London. Pistrucci's sovereign was unusual for a British coin of the 19th century in not having a heraldic design, but this was consistent with Pole's desire to make the sovereign look as different from the guinea as possible.  Circulation years (1817‚Äì1914)  = Early years (1817‚Äì1837) = When the sovereign entered circulation in late 1817, it was not initially popular, as the public preferred the convenience of the banknotes the sovereign had been intended to replace. Lack of demand meant that mintages dropped from 2,347,230 in 1818 to 3,574 the following year. Another reasons why few sovereigns were struck in 1819 was in furtherance of a proposal, eventually rejected, by economist David Ricardo to eliminate gold as a coinage metal, though making it available on demand from the Bank of England. Once this plan was abandoned in 1820, the Bank encouraged the circulation of gold sovereigns, but acceptance among the British public was slow. As difficulties over the exchange of wartime banknotes were overcome, the sovereign became more popular, and with low-value banknotes becoming scarcer, in 1826 Parliament prohibited the issuance of notes with a value of less than five pounds in England and Wales. The early sovereigns were heavily exported; in 1819, Robert Peel estimated that of the some ¬£5,000,000 in gold struck in France since the previous year, three-quarters of the gold used had come from the new British coinage, melted down. Many more sovereigns were exported to France in the 1820s as the metal alloyed with the gold contained silver, which could be profitably recovered, with the gold often returned to Britain and struck again into sovereigns. Beginning in 1829, the Mint was able to eliminate the silver, but the drain on sovereigns from before this continued. George III died in January 1820, succeeded by George, Prince Regent, as George IV. Mint officials decided to continue to use the late king's head on coinage for the remainder of the year. For King George IV's coinage, Pistrucci modified the George and Dragon reverse, eliminating the surrounding Garter ribbon and motto, with a reeded border substituted. Pistrucci also modified the figure of the saint, placing a sword in his hand in place of the broken lance seen previously, eliminating the streamer from his helmet, and refining the look of the cloak. The obverse design for George IV's sovereigns featured a \\"Laureate head\\" of George IV, based on the bust Pistrucci had prepared for the Coronation medal. The new version was authorised by an Order in Council of 5 May 1821. These were struck every year between 1821 and 1825, but the King was unhappy with the depiction of him and requested a new one be prepared, based on a more flattering bust by Francis Chantrey. Pistrucci refused to copy the work of another artist and was barred from further work on the coinage. Second Engraver (later Chief Engraver) William Wyon was assigned to translate Chantrey's bust into a coin design, and the new sovereign came into use during 1825. It did not bear the George and Dragon design, as the new Master of the Mint, Thomas Wallace, disliked several of the current coinage designs, and had Jean Baptiste Merlen of the Royal Mint prepare new reverse designs. The new reverse for the sovereign featured the Ensigns Armorial, or royal arms of the United Kingdom, crowned, with the lions of England seen in two of the quarters, balanced by that of Scotland and the harp of Ireland. Set on the shield are the arms of Hanover, again crowned, depicting the armorial bearings of Brunswick, L√ºneburg and Celle. The George and Dragon design would not again appear on the sovereign until 1871. William IV's accession in 1830 upon the death of his brother George led to new designs for the sovereign, with the new King's depiction engraved by William Wyon based on a bust by Chantrey. Two slightly different busts were used, with what is usually called the \\"first bust\\" used for most 1831 circulating pieces (the first year of production) and some from 1832, with the \\"second bust\\" used for the prototype pattern coins that year, as well as for proof coins of 1831, some from 1832 and taking over entirely by 1833. The reverse shows another depiction by Merlen of the Ensigns Armorial, with the date accompanied by the Latin word \\"Anno\\", or year. These were struck every year until the year of the King's death, 1837. = Victorian era = 261x261px The accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 ended the personal union between Britain and Hanover, as under the latter's Salic Law, a woman could not take the Hanoverian throne. Thus, both sides of the sovereign had to be changed. Wyon designed his \\"Young head\\" portrait of the Queen, which he engraved, for the obverse, and Merlen engraved the reverse, depicting the royal arms inside a wreath, and likely played some part in designing it. The new coin was approved on 26 February 1838, and with the exception of 1840 and 1867, the \\"shield back\\" sovereign was struck at the Royal Mint in London every year from 1838 to 1874. Sovereigns struck at London with the shield design between 1863 and 1874 bear small numbers under the shield, representing which coinage die was used. Records of why the numbers were used are not known to survive, with one widely printed theory that they were used to track die wear. By 1850, some ¬£94 million in sovereigns and half sovereigns had been struck and circulated widely, well beyond Britain's shores, a dispersion aided by the British government, who saw the sovereign's use as an auxiliary to their imperialist ambitions. Gold is a soft metal, and the hazards of circulation tended to make sovereigns lightweight over time. In 1838, when the legacy of James Smithson was converted into gold in preparation for transmission to the United States, American authorities requested recently-struck sovereigns, likely to maximise the quantity of gold when the sovereigns were melted after arrival in the United States. By the early 1840s, the Bank of England estimated that 20 per cent of the gold coins that came into its hands were lightweight. In part to boost the sovereign's reputation in trade, the Bank undertook a programme of recoinage, melting lightweight gold coins and using the gold for new, full- weight ones. Between 1842 and 1845, the Bank withdrew and had recoined some ¬£14 million in lightweight gold, about one-third of the amount of that metal in circulation. This not only kept the sovereign to standard, it probably removed most of the remaining guineas still in commerce. The unlucky holder of a lightweight gold coin could only turn it in as bullion, would lose at least a penny because of the lightness and often had to pay an equal amount to cover the Bank of England's costs. There was also increased quality control within the Royal Mint; by 1866, every gold and silver coin was weighed individually. The result of these efforts was that the sovereign became, in Sir John Clapham's later phrase, the \\"chief coin of the world\\". The California Gold Rush and other discoveries of the 1840s and 1850s boosted the amount of available gold and also the number of sovereigns struck, with ¬£150 million in sovereigns and half sovereigns coined between 1850 and 1875. The wear problem continued: it was estimated that on average, a sovereign became lightweight after fifteen years in circulation. The Coinage Act 1870 tightened standards at the Royal Mint, requiring sovereigns to be individually tested at the annual Trial of the Pyx rather than in bulk. These standards resulted in a high rejection rate for newly-coined sovereigns, though less than for the half sovereign, which sometimes exceeded 50 per cent. When the Royal Mint was rebuilt in 1882, a deciding factor in the decision to shut down production for renovation rather than move to a new mint elsewhere was the Bank of England's report that there was an abnormally large stock of sovereigns and that no harm would result if they could not be coined at London for a year. Advances in technology allowed sovereigns to be individually weighed by automated machines at the Bank of England by the 1890s and efforts to keep the coin at full weight were aided by an 1889 Act of Parliament which allowed redemption of lightweight gold coin at full face value, with the loss from wear to fall upon the government. The Coinage Act 1889 also authorised the Bank of England to redeem worn gold coins from before Victoria's reign but on 22 November 1890, all gold coins from before her reign were called in by Royal Proclamation and demonetised effective 28 February 1891. Due to an ongoing programme to melt and recoin lightweight pieces, estimates of sovereigns in trade weighing less than the legal minimum had fallen to about 4 per cent by 1900. Sovereign counterfeit detector, with coin weights for the sovereign and half sovereign, and two replica coins the size of the sovereign and half sovereign. Each piece would pass one test (weight or fitting exactly through the slot) and fail one. The sovereign was seen in fiction: in Dickens's Oliver Twist, Mrs Bumble is paid for her information with 25 sovereigns. Joseph Conrad, in his novels set in Latin America, refers several times to ship captains keeping sovereigns as a ready store of value. Although many sovereigns were melted down for recoining on reaching a foreign land (as were those for the Smithsonian) it was regarded as a circulating coin in dozens of British colonies and even in nations such as Brazil and Portugal. In 1871, the Deputy Master of the Mint, Sir Charles Fremantle, restored the Pistrucci George and Dragon design to the sovereign, as part of a drive to beautify the coinage. The return of Saint George was approved by the Queen, and authorised by an Order in Council dated 14 January 1871. The two designs were struck side by side in London from 1871 to 1874, and at the Australian branch mints until 1887, after which the Pistrucci design alone was used. The saint returned to the rarely-struck two- and five-pound pieces in 1887, and was placed on the half-sovereign in 1893. Wyon's \\"Young head\\" of Queen Victoria for the sovereign's obverse was struck from 1838 until 1887, when it was replaced by the \\"Jubilee head\\" by Sir Joseph Boehm. That obverse was criticised and was replaced in 1893 by the \\"Old head\\" by Sir Thomas Brock. Victoria's death in 1901 led to a new obverse for her son and successor, Edward VII by George William de Saulles, which began production in 1902; Edward's death in 1910 necessitated a new obverse for his son, George V by Bertram Mackennal. Pistrucci's George and Dragon design continued on the reverse. = Branch mint coinage = The 1852 Adelaide Pound (on average) contains 8.75 grams of gold (0.9170 fine) and weighs 0.2580 of an ounce. The 1851 discovery of gold in Australia quickly led to calls from the local populace for the establishment of a branch of the Royal Mint in the colonies there. Authorities in Adelaide did not wait for London to act, but set up an assay office, striking what became known as the \\"Adelaide Pound\\". In 1853, an Order in Council approved the establishment of the Sydney Mint; the Melbourne Mint would follow in 1872, and the Perth Mint in 1899. The act which regulated currency in New South Wales came into force on 18 July 1855 and stipulated that the gold coins were to be called sovereigns and half-sovereigns. They were also to be the same weight, fineness and value as other sovereigns. Sovereign, 1855, from original gold coin, Sydney Mint, State Library of New South Wales, SAFE/DN/C 1 Early issues for Sydney, until 1870, depicted a bust of Victoria similar to those struck in Britain, but with a wreath of banksia, native to Australia, in her hair. The reverse was distinctive as well, with the name of the mint, the word and the denomination on the reverse. These coins were not initially legal tender outside Australia, as there were concerns about the design and about the light colour of the gold used (due to a higher percentage of silver in the alloy) but from 1866 Australian sovereigns were legal tender alongside those struck in London. Beginning in 1870, the designs were those used in London, though with a mint mark \\"S\\" or \\"M\\" (or, later, \\"P\\") denoting their origin. The mints at Melbourne and Sydney were allowed to continue striking the shield design even though it had been abandoned at the London facility, and did so until 1887 due to local popularity. The large issues of the colonial mints meant that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns circulating in Britain were from Australia. Dies for the Australian coinage were made at London. 2017-I sovereign in card of issue Following the Klondike Gold Rush, the Canadian Government asked for the establishment of a Royal Mint branch in Canada. It was not until 1908 that what is now the Royal Canadian Mint, in Ottawa, opened, and it struck sovereigns with the mint mark \\"C\\" from 1908 to 1919, excepting 1912, each year in small numbers. Branch mints at Bombay (1918; mint mark \\"I\\") and Pretoria (1923‚Äì1932; mint mark \\"SA\\") also struck sovereigns. Melbourne and Perth stopped striking sovereigns after 1931, with Sydney having closed in 1926. The 1932 sovereigns struck at Pretoria were the last to be issued intended as currency at their face value. To address the high demand for gold coins in the Indian market, which does not allow gold coins to be imported, the minting of gold sovereigns in India with mint mark I has resumed since 2013. Indian/Swiss joint venture company MMTC-PAMP mints under licence in its facility close to Delhi with full quality control from the Royal Mint. The coins are legal tender in Great Britain.  Trade coin (1914‚Äì1979)  First World War propaganda poster featuring the sovereign coin In the late 19th century, several Chancellors of the Exchequer had questioned the wisdom of having much of Britain's stock of gold used in coinage. Lord Randolph Churchill proposed relying less on gold coinage and moving to high-value silver coins, and the short-lived double florin or four-shilling piece is a legacy of his views. Churchill's successor, George Goschen, urged the issuance of banknotes to replace the gold coinage, and stated that he would prefer to have ¬£20 million in gold in the Bank of England than 30 million sovereigns in the hands of the public. Fears that widespread forgery of banknotes would shake confidence in the pound ended his proposal. In March 1914, John Maynard Keynes noted that the large quantities of gold arriving from South Africa were making the sovereign even more important, \\"The combination of the demand for sovereigns in India and Egypt with London's situation as the distributing centre of the South African gold is rapidly establishing the sovereign as the predominant gold coin of the world. Possibly it may be destined to hold in the future the same kind of international position as was held for several centuries, in the days of a silver standard, by the Mexican dollar.\\" As Britain moved towards war in the July Crisis of 1914, many sought to convert Bank of England notes into gold, and the bank's reserves of that metal fell from ¬£27 million on 29 July to ¬£11 million on 1 August. Following the declaration of war against Germany on 4 August, the government circulated one-pound and ten-shilling banknotes in place of the sovereign and half sovereign. Restrictions were placed on sending gold abroad, and the melting-down of coin made an offence. Not all were enthusiastic about the change from gold to paper: J.J. Cullimore Allen, in his 1965 book on sovereigns, recalled meeting his first payroll after the change to banknotes, with the workers dubious about the banknotes and initially asking to be paid in gold. Allen converted five sovereigns from his own pocket into notes, and the workers made no further objection. Conversion into gold was not forbidden, but the Chancellor, David Lloyd George, made it clear that such actions would be unpatriotic and would harm the war effort. Few insisted on payment in gold in the face of such appeals, and by mid-1915, the sovereign was rarely seen in London commerce. The coin was depicted on propaganda posters, which urged support for the war. Although sovereigns continued to be struck at London until the end of 1917, they were mostly held as part of the nation's gold reserves, or were paid out for war debts to the United States. They were still used as currency in some foreign countries, especially in the Middle East. Sovereigns continued to be struck at the Australian mints, where different economic circumstances prevailed. After the war, the sovereign did not return to commerce in Britain, with the pieces usually worth more as gold than as currency. In 1925, the Chancellor, Winston Churchill, secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act 1925, restoring Britain to that standard, but with gold to be kept in reserve rather than as a means of circulation. The effort failed‚ÄîChurchill regarded it as the worst mistake of his life‚Äî-but some lightweight sovereigns were melted and restruck dated 1925, and were released only later. Many of the Australian pieces struck in the postwar period were to back currency, while the South African sovereigns were mostly for export and to pay workers at the gold mines. By the time Edward VIII came to the throne in 1936, there was no question of issuing sovereigns for circulation, but pieces were prepared as part of the traditional proof set of coins issued in the Coronation year. With a bust of King Edward by Humphrey Paget and the date 1937, these sovereigns were not authorised by Royal Proclamation prior to the King's abdication in December 1936, and are considered pattern coins. Extremely rare, one sold in 2020 for ¬£1,000,000, setting a record for a British coin. Sovereigns in proof condition dated 1937 were struck for Edward's brother and successor, George VI, also designed by Paget, the only sovereigns to bear George's effigy. The 1925-dated George V sovereign was restruck in 1949, 1951 and 1952, lowering the value of the original, of which only a few had hitherto been known. These were struck to meet the need for sovereigns, and to maintain the skills of the Royal Mint in striking them. The sovereign remained popular as a trade coin in the Middle East and elsewhere following the Second World War. The small strikings of 1925-dated sovereigns in the postwar period were not enough to meet the demand, which was met in part by counterfeiters in Europe and the Middle East, who often put full value of gold in the pieces. A counterfeiting prosecution was brought, to which the defence was made that the sovereign was no longer a current coin. The judge directed an acquittal although the sovereign remained legal tender under the Coinage Act 1870. Sovereigns were struck in 1953, the Coronation year of Elizabeth II, bearing the portrait of the Queen by Mary Gillick, though the gold pieces were only placed in the major museums. A 1953 sovereign sold at auction in 2014 for ¬£384,000. In 1957, the Treasury decided to defend the status of the sovereign both by continuing prosecutions, and by issuing new pieces with the current date. Elizabeth II sovereigns bearing Gillick's portrait were struck as bullion pieces between 1957 and 1959, and from 1962 to 1968. The counterfeiting problem was minimised by the striking of about 45,000,000 sovereigns by 1968, and efforts by Treasury solicitors which resulted in the sovereign's acceptance as legal tender by the highest courts of several European nations. In 1966, the Wilson Government placed restrictions on the holding of gold coins to prevent hoarding against inflation, with collectors required to obtain a licence from the Bank of England. This proved ineffective, as it drove gold dealing underground, and was abandoned in 1970. The sovereign's role in popular culture continued: in the 1957 novel From Russia, with Love, Q issues James Bond with a briefcase, the handle of which contains 50 sovereigns. When held at gunpoint on the Orient Express by Red Grant, Bond uses the gold to distract Grant, leading to the villain's undoing. The sovereign survived both decimalisation and the move of the Royal Mint from Tower Hill, London to Llantrisant, Wales. The last of the Gillick sovereigns had been struck in 1968; when production resumed in 1974, it was with a portrait by Arnold Machin. The last coin minted at Tower Hill, in 1975, was a sovereign.  Bullion and collectors coin (1979 to present)  From 1979, the sovereign was issued as a coin for the bullion market, but was also struck by the Royal Mint in proof condition for collectors, and this issuance of proof coins has continued annually. In 1985, the Machin portrait of the Queen was replaced by one by Raphael Maklouf. Striking of bullion sovereigns had been suspended after 1982, and so the Maklouf portrait, struck every year but 1989 until the end of 1997, is seen on the sovereign only in proof condition. In 1989, a commemorative sovereign, the first, was issued for the 500th anniversary of Henry VII's sovereign. The coin, designed by Bernard Sindall, evokes the designs of that earlier piece, showing the Queen enthroned and facing front, as Henry appeared on the old English sovereign. The reverse of the 1489 piece depicts a double Tudor rose fronted by the royal arms; a similar design with updated arms graces the reverse of the 1989 sovereign. Ian Rank-Broadley designed the fourth bust of the Queen to be used on the sovereign, and this went into use in 1998 and was used until 2015. Bullion sovereigns began to be issued again in 2000, and this has continued. A special reverse design was used in 2002 for the Golden Jubilee, with an adaptation of the royal arms on a shield by Timothy Noad recalling the 19th-century \\"shield back\\" sovereigns. The years 2005 and 2012 (the latter, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee) saw interpretations of the George and Dragon design, the first by Noad, the later by Paul Day. In 2009, the reverse was re-engraved using tools from the reign of George III in the hope of better capturing Pistrucci's design. A new portrait of the Queen by Jody Clark was introduced during 2015, and some sovereigns were issued with the new bust. The most recent special designs, in 2016 and 2017, were only for collectors. The 2016 collector's piece, for the Queen's 90th birthday, has a one-year-only portrait of her on the obverse designed by James Butler. The 2017 collector's piece returned to Pistrucci's original design of 1817 for the modern sovereign's 200th birthday, with the Garter belt and motto. A piedfort was also minted, and the bullion sovereign struck at Llantrisant, though retaining the customary design, was given a privy mark with the number 200. In 2017, a collection of 633 gold sovereigns and 280 half sovereigns was discovered to have been hoarded inside an upright piano which had been donated to a community college in Shropshire, England. The coins, which date from 1847 to 1915, were found by a technician who had been asked to tune the piano, 'stitched into seven cloth packets and a leather drawstring purse' under the piano's keyboard. Despite inquiries being made as to who could have stored the coins, no owner or claimants were found. =Collecting, other use and tax treatment= Sydney Mint sovereign, 1857 Many of the variant designs of the sovereign since 1989 have been intended to appeal to coin collectors, as have the other gold coins based on the sovereign, from the quarter sovereign to the five-sovereign piece. To expedite matters, the Royal Mint is authorised to sell gold sovereigns directly to the public, rather than having its output channelled through the Bank of England as was once the case. As a legal tender coin, the sovereign is exempt from capital gains tax for UK residents. As well as being used as a circulating coin, the sovereign has entered fashion, with some men in the 19th century placing one on their pocket watch chains; wearing one in that fashion came to be seen as a sign of integrity. Others carried their sovereigns in a small purse known as a sovereign case, linked to the watch chain. These customs vanished with the popularisation of the wrist watch. Women also have worn sovereigns, as bangles or ear rings. In the 21st century, the wearing of a sovereign ring has been seen as a sign of chav culture. Coin auction houses deal in rare sovereigns of earlier date, as do specialist dealers. As well as the 1937 Edward VIII and 1953 Elizabeth II sovereigns, rare dates in the series include the 1819, and the 1863 piece with the number \\"827\\" on the obverse in place of William Wyon's initials. The 827 likely is an ingot number, used for some sort of experiment, though research has not conclusively established this. Few 1879 sovereigns were struck at London, and those that remain are often well-worn. Only 24,768 of the Adelaide Pound were struck; surviving specimens are rare and highly prized. The sovereign itself has been the subject of commemoration; in 2005, the Perth Mint issued a gold coin with face value A$25, reproducing the reverse design of the pre-1871 Sydney Mint sovereigns.

The first modern vending machines were developed in England in the early 1880s and dispensed postcards. Vending machines exist in many countries and, in more recent times, specialized vending machines that provide less common products compared to traditional vending machine items have been created. History The earliest known reference to a vending machine is in the work of Hero of Alexandria, an engineer and mathematician in first-century Roman Egypt. His machine accepted a coin and then dispensed holy water. When the coin was deposited, it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The lever opened a valve which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counterweight snapped the lever up and turned off the valve. Coin-operated machines that dispensed tobacco were being operated as early as 1615 in the taverns of England. The machines were portable and made of brass. An English bookseller, Richard Carlile, devised a newspaper dispensing machine for the dissemination of banned works in 1822. Simeon Denham was awarded British Patent no. 706 for his stamp dispensing machine in 1867, the first fully automatic vending machine. =Modern vending machines= An automatic stamp and postcard vending machine, made by Takashichi Tawaraya in 1904 in Japan. The first modern coin- operated vending machines were introduced in London, England in the early 1880s, dispensing postcards. The machine was invented by Percival Everitt in 1883 and soon became a widespread feature at railway stations and post offices, dispensing envelopes, postcards, and notepaper. The Sweetmeat Automatic Delivery Company was founded in 1887 in England as the first company to deal primarily with the installation and maintenance of vending machines. In 1893, Stollwerck, a German chocolate manufacturer, was selling its chocolate in 15,000 vending machines. It set up separate companies in various territories to manufacture vending machines to sell not just chocolate, but cigarettes, matches, chewing gum and soap products. The first vending machine in the U.S. was built in 1888 by the Thomas Adams Gum Company, selling gum on New York City train platforms. The idea of adding games to these machines as a further incentive to buy came in 1897 when the Pulver Manufacturing Company added small figures, which would move around whenever somebody bought some gum from their machines. This idea spawned a whole new type of mechanical device known as the \\"trade stimulators\\". Mechanisms Internal communication in vending machines is typically based on the MDB standard, supported by National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) and European Vending & Coffee Service Association (EVA). After payment has been tendered, a product may become available by: * the machine releasing it, so that it falls in an open compartment at the bottom, or into a cup, either released first, or put in by the customer, or * the unlocking of a door, drawer, or turning of a knob. Some products need to be prepared to become available. For example, tickets are printed or magnetized on the spot, and coffee is freshly concocted. One of the most common form of vending machine, the snack machine, often uses a metal coil which when ordered rotates to release the product. The main example of a vending machine giving access to all merchandise after paying for one item is a newspaper vending machine (also called vending box) found mainly in the U.S. and Canada. It contains a pile of identical newspapers. After a sale the door automatically returns to a locked position. A customer could open the box and take all of the newspapers or, for the benefit of other customers, leave all of the newspapers outside of the box, slowly return the door to an unlatched position, or block the door from fully closing, each of which are frequently discouraged, sometimes by a security clamp. The success of such machines is predicated on the assumption that the customer will be honest (hence the nickname \\"honor box\\"), and need only one copy. Common vending machines =Change machine= A change machine is a vending machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins. Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as bill changers. =Cigarette vending= A cigarette machine in South Korea In the past, cigarettes were commonly sold in the United States through these machines, but this is increasingly rare due to concerns about underage buyers. Sometimes a pass has to be inserted in the machine to prove one's age before a purchase can be made. In the United Kingdom, legislation banning them outright came into effect on 1 October 2011. In Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic and Japan, cigarette machines are still common. Since 2007, however, age verification has been mandatory in Germany and Italy - buyers must be 18 or over. The various machines installed in pubs and caf√©s, other publicly accessible buildings and on the street accept one or more of the following as proof of age: the buyer's identity card, bank debit card (smart card) or European Union driver's license. In Japan, age verification has been mandatory since 1 July 2008 via the Taspo card, issued only to persons aged 20 or over. The Taspo card uses RFID, stores monetary value, and is contactless. =Birth control and condom vending machines= A birth control machine is a vending machine for the sale of birth control, such as condoms or emergency contraception. Condom machines are often placed in public toilets, subway stations, airports or schools as a public health measure to promote safe sex. Many pharmacies also keep one outside, for after-hours access. Rare examples exist that dispense female condoms or the morning after pill. =Food and snack vending machines= snack food vending machine in Hong Kong Various types of food and snack vending machines exist in the world. Food vending machines that provide shelf-stable foods such as chips, cookies, cakes and other such snacks are common. Some food vending machines are refrigerated or frozen, such as for chilled soft drinks and ice cream treats, and some machines provide hot food. Some unique food vending machines exist that are specialized and less common, such as the French fry vending machine and hot pizza vending machines, such as Let's Pizza. Bulk candy and gumball vending Bulk vending: a bulk candy machine containing M&Ms;, Skittles, and Runts The profit margins in the bulk candy business can be quite high ‚Äì gumballs, for instance, can be purchased in bulk for around 2 cents per piece and sold for 25 cents in gumball machines in the U.S., and other countries. Gumballs and candy have a relatively long shelf life, enabling vending machine operators to manage many machines without too much time or cost involved. In addition, the machines are typically inexpensive compared to soft drink or snack machines, which often require power and sometimes refrigeration to work. Many operators donate a percentage of the profits to charity so that locations will allow them to place the machines for free. Bulk vending may be a more practical choice than soft drink/snack vending for an individual who also works a full-time job, since the restaurants, retail stores, and other locations suitable for bulk vending may be more likely to be open during the evening and on weekends than venues such as offices that host soft drink and snack machines. The Bulk vending machines of today provide many different vending choices with the use of adjustable gumball and candy wheels. Adjustable gumball wheels allow an operator to not only offer the traditional 1-inch gumball, but they can also vend larger gumballs, and non-edible items such as toy capsules and bouncy balls. Adjustable candy wheels allow an operator to offer a variety of pressed candies, jelly candy, and even nuts. Full-line vending full line of vending machines in a hospital cafeteria, including machines for drinks, snacks, and microwaveable foods A full-line vending company may set up several types of vending machines that sell a wide range of products. Products may include candy, cookies, chips, fresh fruit, milk, cold food, coffee and other hot drinks, bottles and cans of soda and other drinks, and even frozen products like ice cream. These products can be sold from machines that include hot coffee, snack, cold food, and bottle machines. In the United States, almost all machines accept bills with more and more machines accepting $5 bills, along payment from traditional debit and credit cards, or a mobile payment system. This is an advantage to the vendor because it virtually eliminates the need for a bill changer. Larger corporations with cafeterias will often request full line vending to supplement their food service. =Newspaper vending machine= A newspaper vending machine or newspaper rack is a vending machine designed to distribute newspapers. Newspaper vending machines are used worldwide, and they can be one of the main distribution methods for newspaper publishers. According to the Newspaper Association of America, in recent times in the United States, circulation via newspaper vending machines has dropped significantly: in 1996, around 46% of single-sale newspapers were sold in newspaper boxes, and in 2014, only 20% of newspapers were sold in the boxes. =Photo booth= A photo booth at a hotel A photo booth is a vending machine or modern kiosk that contains an automated, usually coin-operated, camera and film processor. Today, the vast majority of photo booths are digital. Traditionally, photo booths contain a seat or bench designed to seat the one or two patrons being photographed. The seat is typically surrounded by a curtain of some sort to allow for some privacy and help avoid outside interference during the photo session. Once the payment is made, the photo booth will take a series of photographs and the customer is then provided with prints. Older photo booth vending machines used film and involved the process of developing the film using liquid chemicals. =Stamp vending machine= A stamp vending machine is a mechanical, electrical or electro-mechanical device which can be used to automatically vend postage stamps to users in exchange for a pre-determined amount of money, normally in coin. =Ticket machines= Ticket machines at a railway station in Metro Vancouver, Canada A ticket machine is a vending machine that produces tickets. For instance, ticket machines dispense train tickets at railway stations, transit tickets at metro stations and tram tickets at some tram stops and in some trams. The typical transaction consists of a user using the display interface to select the type and quantity of tickets and then choosing a payment method of either cash, credit/debit card or smartcard. The ticket or tickets are then printed and dispensed to the user. Specialized vending machines From 2000-2010, the specialization of vending machines became more common. Vending extended increasingly into non- traditional areas like electronics, or even artwork or short stories. Machines of this new category are generally called Automated retail kiosks. When using an automated retail machine, consumers select products, sometimes using a touchscreen interface, pay for purchases using a credit or debit card and then the product is dispensed, sometimes via an internal robotic arm in the machine. The trend of specialization and proliferation of vending machines is perhaps most apparent in Japan where vending machines sell products from toilet paper to hot meals and pornography, and there is 1 vending machine per 23 people. =Automobile vending machine= In November 2013, online auto retailer Carvana opened the first car vending machine in the U.S. located in Atlanta. In late 2016, Autobahn Motors, a car dealership in Singapore, opened a 15-story-tall luxury car vending machine containing 60 cars, dispensing Ferrari and Lamborghini vehicles. =Bait vending machine= bait vending machine in Brighton, Michigan A bait machine is a vending machine that dispenses live fishing bait, such as worms and crickets, for fishing. =Book vending machine= Book vending machines dispense books, which may be full- sized. Some libraries use book vending machines. GoLibrary is a book lending vending machine used by libraries in Sweden and the U.S. state of California.In California, a New ATM for Books Debuts. Lynn Blumenstein. Library Journal. 26 February 2008. Retrieved 7 May 2011.The California State Library GoLibrary Project uses automated materials vending to aid underserved populations in new ways . Susan Kantor-Horning. Library Journal. 15 August 2009. Retrieved 7 May 2011. =French fry vending machine= A French fry vending machine is a vending machine that dispenses hot French fries, also known as chips. The first known french fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. =Pizza vending machine= Carpi, Italy that dispenses hot pizza Let's Pizza is the name of a vending machine that makes fresh pizza from scratch. It was developed in 2009 by Italian company Sitos srl. The machine combines water, flour, tomato sauce, and fresh ingredients to make a pizza in approximately three minutes. It includes windows so customers can watch the pizza as it is made. The pizza is cooked in an infrared oven. The device was invented by Claudio Torghele, an entrepreneur in Rovereto, Italy. The vending machine began in Italy and is now spreading into the United Kingdom and becoming popular there. =Life insurance= From the 1950s until the 1970s, vending machines were used at American airports to sell life insurance policies covering death, in the event that the buyer's flight crashed. However, this practice gradually disappeared due to the tendency of American courts to strictly construe such policies against their sellers, such as the Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York (which later became part of CNA Financial).Steven v. Fidelity & Casualty Co. (1962) 58 C2d 862 =Marijuana vending machine= A marijuana vending machine originally found a niche market as a vending machine for selling or dispensing cannabis. Recently, thanks to changes in legislations across Europe and the UK, the United States and Canada and other countries around the world, marijuana vending machines (also known as cannabis vending machines) today are widely diffused, and sell a wide range of cannabis, hemp and CBD-related products that starts with the THC-based cannabis flowers in countries where the legislation allows cannabis consumption, or CBD-only, legal cannabis all across the global market, and includes marijuana, hemp and CBD based products that includes, among others, hemp and CBD oils, tinctures and infusions, hemp- based food products, cannabis edibles, CBD cosmetics, hemp beers, sodas and teas, smoke paraphernalia and more. The first experiments in distributing marijuana through vending machines started in the early 2010s, when they were already in use in the United States and Canada. The primary challenge faced in selling restricted or controlled merchandise like cannabis is to verify the identity of the user in front of the vending machine making the purchase, which is overcome by the application of biometrics and smart vending software technology, the same technology used to verify the buyer's age in the automatic sales of tobacco. =Mold-A-Rama= The Mold-A-Rama is a brand name for a type of vending machine that makes blow-molded plastic figurines. Mold- A-Rama machines debuted in late 1962 and grew in prominence at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The machines can still be found operating in dozens of museums and zoos. =Fresh-squeezed orange juice= Orange juice vending machine The fresh-squeezed orange juice contains fresh oranges and a mechanism to cut and squeeze them on order to produce fresh juice. =Prize vending machine= A prize vending machine in Haikou, Hainan, China This type of machine sells a container that may contain a prize. Some such machines advertise the possible prizes that may be won. Examples include smart phones, holiday packages, and toys. =Social-networked vending machine= With the rise of the social networks, vending machine has been integrated to social media in order to proliferate the interaction of the vending machine with the users from the physical machine to the social networks. The common application of social-networked vending machine is that the user can connect his/her social account to a specific social media designated by the vending machine, the user will be getting some rewards in return, normally in the form of free gift dispensed from the vending machine. Popularity in Japan A vending machine with wooden exterior at Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine in ≈åda, Shimane, Japan Vending machines are a common sight in Japan. There are more than 5.5 million throughout the nation. It is the highest ratio for any country with one machine for every twenty-five people. Regarding the development of advanced technology, Japanese vending machines provide more services by selling different kinds of products. Food, smartphones, SIM cards and even underpants can be found in these machines. Apart from the most popular drink vending machines, Japanese vending machines also offer certain products depending on the demand and need for different locations. For example, products like sanitary napkins and tampons can be found in vending machines in female restrooms, while machines selling condoms are usually located in male restrooms. A vending machine of retort pouched curries at Asakusa, Japan There are a number of reasons which can explain why local vending machines can win their high popularity throughout the country. Convenience, low cost of running, security stability seems to be the main reasons for Japanese to investigate in the field of vending machines. A patent for an \\"automatic goods vending machine\\" was filed in 1888 in Japan; early surviving vending machines from around the 1900s include one that dispenses stamps and postcards, and one that dispenses sake. Confectionery vending machine became widespread in the 1920s, and juice vending machines became popular in the late 1950s and 1960s. By 2000, the number of vending machines in Japan have grown to 5.6 million. However, after the 2000s, as the world is moving to a more digital age, the number of vending machines in Japan has decreased to 5.03 million and the sales amount has also been decreasing gradually. Smart vending machines Similar to the development of traditional mobile phones into smartphones, vending machines have also progressively, though at a much slower pace, evolved into smart vending machines. Newer technologies at a lower cost of adoption, such as the large digital touch display, internet connectivity, cameras and various types of sensors, more cost-effective embedded computing power, digital signage, various advanced payment systems, and a wide range of identification technology (NFC, RFID, etc) According to market research by Frost & Sullivan, global shipments of smart vending machines are forecasted to reach around 2 million units by 2018, and further to 3.6 million units by 2020 with penetration rate of 20.3 percent.

The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and the cloud of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO). Space debris (also known as space junk, space pollution, space waste, space trash, or space garbage) is a term for defunct human-made objects in space‚Äîprincipally in Earth orbit‚Äîwhich no longer serve a useful function. These include derelict spacecraft‚Äînonfunctional spacecraft and abandoned launch vehicle stages‚Äîmission-related debris, and particularly numerous in Earth orbit, fragmentation debris from the breakup of derelict rocket bodies and spacecraft. In addition to derelict human-built objects left in orbit, other examples of space debris include fragments from their disintegration, erosion and collisions, or even paint flecks, solidified liquids expelled from spacecraft, and unburned particles from solid rocket motors. Space debris represents a risk to spacecraft. Space debris is typically a negative externality‚Äîit creates an external cost on others from the initial action to launch or use a spacecraft in near-Earth orbit‚Äîa cost that is typically not taken into account nor fully accounted for in the cost by the launcher or payload owner.https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/preventing-space- pollution/ Several spacecraft, both manned and unmanned, have been damaged or destroyed by space debris. The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the space industry. , the US Space Surveillance Network reported nearly 20,000 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth, including 2,218 operational satellites. However, these are just the objects large enough to be tracked. , more than 128 million pieces of debris smaller than , about 900,000 pieces of debris 1‚Äì10 cm, and around 34,000 of pieces larger than 10 cm were estimated to be in orbit around the Earth.\\"Space debris by the numbers\\" ESA, January 2019. Retrieved 5 March 2019 When the smallest objects of human-made space debris (paint flecks, solid rocket exhaust particles, etc.) are grouped with micrometeoroids, they are together sometimes referred to by space agencies as MMOD (Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris). Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; the smallest objects cause damage akin to sandblasting, especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or star trackers that cannot easily be protected by a ballistic shield. Below Earth-altitude, pieces of debris are denser than meteoroids; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from RORSAT (nuclear- powered satellites). For comparison, the International Space Station orbits in the range, while the two most recent large debris events‚Äîthe 2007 Chinese antisat weapon test and the 2009 satellite collision‚Äîoccurred at altitude. The ISS has Whipple shielding to resist damage from small MMOD; however, known debris with a collision chance over 1/10,000 are avoided by manoeuvring the station.  History  Space debris began to accumulate in Earth orbit immediately with the first launch of an artificial satellite into orbit in 1957. After the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) began compiling a database (the Space Object Catalog) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper-stages of launch vehicles. NASA later published modified versions of the database in two-line element set, and beginning in the early 1980s the CelesTrak bulletin board system re-published them.T.S. Kelso, CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives , 2-line elements dating to 1980 Gabbard diagram of almost 300 pieces of debris from the disintegration of the five-month-old third stage of the Chinese Long March 4 booster on 11 March 2000 The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.Schefter, p. 48. Some were deliberately caused during the 1960s anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modeling of orbital evolution and decay. When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, techniques developed for the asteroid-belt were applied to the study to the database of known artificial satellite Earth objects. Baker-Nunn cameras were widely used to study space debris. In addition to approaches to debris reduction where time and natural gravitational/atmospheric effects help to clear space debris, or a variety of technological approaches that have been proposed (with most not implemented) to reduce space debris, a number of scholars have observed that institutional factors‚Äîpolitical, legal, economic and cultural \\"rules of the game\\"‚Äîare the greatest impediment to the cleanup of near-Earth space. By 2014, there was little commercial incentive to reduce space debris, since the cost of dealing with it is not assigned to the entity producing it, but rather falls on all users of the space environment, and rely on human society as a whole that benefits from space technologies and knowledge. A number of suggestions for improving institutions so as to increase the incentives to reduce space debris have been made. These include government mandates to create incentives, as well as companies coming to see economic benefit to reducing debris more aggressively than existing government standard practices. In 1979 NASA founded the Orbital Debris Program to research mitigation measures for space debris in Earth orbit. = Debris growth = During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One trial solution was implemented by McDonnell Douglas for the Delta launch vehicle, by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated one source for pressure buildup in the tanks which had previously caused them to explode and create additional orbital debris.Schefter, p. 50. Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the Soviet Union, the problem grew throughout the decade.See charts, Hoffman p. 7. A new battery of studies followed as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000, new detectors in the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.See chart, Hoffman p. 4. By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,In the time between writing of Klinkrad (2006) Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of Space Debris, Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 ‚Äì compare pp. 6 and ix. and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an ASAT test and a satellite collision.Michael Hoffman, \\"It's getting crowded up there.\\" Space News, 3 April 2009. In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.\\"Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites\\" , Fox News, 6 April 2011. A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.Stefan Lovgren, \\"Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn.\\" National Geographic News, 19 January 2006.J.-C Liou and N.

The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space‚Äî900 to and ‚Äîwere already past critical density.Technical, p. 7. In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, University of Southampton researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. , more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.Paul Marks, \\"Space debris threat to future launches\\" , 27 October 2009. A 2011 report by the U.S. National Research Council warned NASA that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris \\"has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures\\". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.Space junk at tipping point, says report , BBC News, 2 September 2011 By the late 2010s, plans by multiple providers to deploy large megaconstellations of broadband internet satellites had been licensed by regulatory authorities, with operational satellites entering production by both OneWeb and SpaceX. The first deployments occurred in 2019 with six from OneWeb, followed by 60 satellites from SpaceX in May, the first satellites for the project Starlink. While the increased satellite density causes concerns, both licensing authorities and the manufacturers are well aware of debris problems. The vendors must have debris-reduction plans, and are taking measures to actively de-orbit unneeded satellites and/or ensure their orbits will decay naturally.

This is beginning to change in 2019, and several companies have begun to deploy the early phases of satellite internet constellations, which will have many universal orbits in LEO with 30 to 50 satellites per orbital plane and altitude. Traditionally, the most populated LEO orbits have been a number of sun-synchronous satellites that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the orbital plane, making Earth observation easier with consistent sun angle and lighting. Sun-synchronous orbits are polar, meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, typically up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects. The density of satellites‚Äîboth active and derelict‚Äîis much higher in LEO.Matt Ford, \\"Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes.\\" Ars Technica, 27 February 2009. Orbits are affected by gravitational perturbations (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field due to variations in the density of the planet), and collisions can occur from any direction. Impacts between orbiting satellites can occur at up to 16 km/s for a theoretical head-on impact; the closing speed could be twice the orbital speed. The 2009 satellite collision occurred at a closing speed of 11.7 km/s,\\"What are hypervelocity impacts?\\" ESA, 19 February 2009. creating over 2000 large debris fragments. These debris cross many other orbits and increase debris collision risk. It is theorized that a sufficiently large collision of spacecraft could potentially lead to a cascade effect, or even make some particular low Earth orbits effectively unusable for long term use by orbiting satellites, a phenomenon known as the Kessler syndrome. The theoretical effect is projected to be a theoretical runaway chain reaction of collisions that could occur, exponentially increasing the number and density of space debris in low-Earth orbit, and has been hypothesized to ensue beyond some critical density.Lisa Grossman, \\"NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers\\" , wired, 15 March 2011. Crewed space missions are mostly at altitude and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. The upper atmosphere is not a fixed density at any particular orbital altitude; it varies as a result of atmospheric tides and expands or contracts over longer time periods as a result of space weather. These longer-term effects can increase drag at lower altitudes; the 1990s expansion was a factor in reduced debris density.Kessler 1991, p. 65. Another factor was fewer launches by Russia; the Soviet Union made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s. = Higher altitudes = At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight atmospheric drag, lunar perturbations, Earth's gravity perturbations, solar wind and solar radiation pressure can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.Kessler 1991, p. 268. Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly. Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbits (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as Telstar 401) it assumes a geosynchronous orbit; its orbital inclination increases about .8¬∞ and its speed increases about per year. Impact velocity peaks at about . Orbital perturbations cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and precession of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.\\"Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West.\\" CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics, 6‚Äì10 November 1989. The collision debris pose less short- term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as solar-power satellites, are especially vulnerable to collisions. Although the ITU now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient. Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under , the nature of the problem is not well known.Orbital Debris, p. 86. Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvering and making it easier to predict future motion.Orbital Debris, p. 152. Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in geostationary transfer orbit, are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity. Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit.\\"The Olympus failure\\" ESA press release, 26 August 1993. On 29 March 2006, the Russian Express-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;\\"Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure\\" Russian Satellite Communications Company, 19 April 2006. its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.  Sources  = Dead spacecraft = Vanguard 1 is expected to remain in orbit for 240 years. In 1958, the United States launched Vanguard I into a medium Earth orbit (MEO). , it, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, are the oldest surviving human- made space objects still in orbit.Julian Smith, \\"Space Junk\\" USA Weekend, 26 August 2007. In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the Union of Concerned Scientists listed 902 operational satellites\\"UCS Satellite Database\\" Union of Concerned Scientists, 16 July 2009. from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched. An example of additional derelict satellite debris is the remains of the 1970s/80s Soviet RORSAT naval surveillance satellite program. The satellites' BES-5 nuclear reactors were cooled with a coolant loop of sodium-potassium alloy, creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude graveyard orbits, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight- percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,C. Wiedemann et al, \\"Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009\\", Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris, 30 March‚Äì2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009). forming additional debris.A. Rossi et al, \\"Effects of the RORSAT NaK Drops on the Long Term Evolution of the Space Debris Population\\", University of Pisa, 1997. These events continue to occur. For example, in February 2015, the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which were expected to remain in orbit for decades. Orbiting satellites have been deliberately destroyed. United States and USSR/Russia have conducted over 30 and 27 ASAT tests, respectively, followed by 10 from China and one from India. The most recent ASATs were Chinese interception of FY-1C, trials of Russian PL-19 Nudol, American interception of USA-193 and Indian interception of unstated live satellite. = Lost equipment = thermal blanket photographed in 1998 during STS-88.

However, a major known impact event involved an (intact) Ariane booster. Although NASA and the United States Air Force now require upper-stage passivation, other launchers do not. Lower stages, like the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters or Apollo program's Saturn IB launch vehicles, do not reach orbit.Some return to Earth intact, see this list for examples.

North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) files only contained data for Soviet tests, and debris from U.S. tests were only identified later.Note that the list Schefter was presented only identified USSR ASAT tests.

On 27 March 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India shot down one of its own LEO satellites with a ground-based missile. He stated that the operation, part of Mission Shakti, would defend the country's interests in space. Afterwards, US Air Force Space Command announced they were tracking 270 new pieces of debris but expected the number to grow as data collection continues. The vulnerability of satellites to debris and the possibility of attacking LEO satellites to create debris clouds has triggered speculation that it is possible for countries unable to make a precision attack. An attack on a satellite of 10 tonnes or more would heavily damage the LEO environment.  Hazards  A micrometeoroid left this crater on the surface of 's front window on STS-7. = To spacecraft = Space junk can be a hazard to active satellites and spacecraft. It has been theorized that Earth orbit could even become impassable if the risk of collision grows too high. However, since the risk to spacecraft increases with the time of exposure to high debris densities, it is more accurate to say that LEO would be rendered unusable by orbiting craft. The threat to craft passing through LEO to reach higher orbit would be much lower owing to the very short time span of the crossing.  Uncrewed spacecraft  Although spacecraft are typically protected by Whipple shields, solar panels, which are exposed to the Sun, wear from low- mass impacts. Even small impacts can produce a cloud of plasma which is an electrical risk to the panels. Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and (small) orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However, the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects. Many impacts have been confirmed since. For example, on 24 July 1996, the French microsatellite Cerise was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986. On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable. On 13 October 2009, Terra suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly which were subsequently considered likely the result of an MMOD strike. On 12 March 2010, Aura lost power from one-half of one of its 11 solar panels and this was also attributed to an MMOD strike. On 22 May 2013 GOES-13 was hit by an MMOD which caused it to lose track of the stars that it used to maintain an operational attitude. It took nearly a month for the spacecraft to return to operation.https://web.archive.org/web/20130607192921/http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/SATS/MESS/MSG1422048.01.txt The first major satellite collision occurred on 10 February 2009.

On 22 January 2013 BLITS (a Russian laser-ranging satellite) was struck by debris suspected to be from the 2007 Chinese anti- satellite missile test, changing both its orbit and rotation rate. Satellites sometimes perform Collision Avoidance Maneuvers and satellite operators may monitor space debris as part of maneuver planning. For example, in January 2017, the European Space Agency made the decision to alter orbit of one of its three Swarm mission spacecraft, based on data from the US Joint Space Operations Center, to lower the risk of collision from Cosmos-375, a derelict Russian satellite.  Crewed spacecraft  Crewed flights are naturally particularly sensitive to the hazards that could be presented by space debris conjunctions in the orbital path of the spacecraft. Examples of occasional avoidance maneuvers, or longer-term space debris wear, have occurred in Space Shuttle missions, the MIR space station, and the International Space Station. = Space Shuttle missions = 's lower starboard wing and Thermal Protection System tiles, photographed on STS-114 during an R-Bar Pitch Manoeuvre where astronauts examine the TPS for any damage during ascent From the early Space Shuttle missions, NASA used NORAD space monitoring capabilities to assess the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used a large proportion of NORAD capacity. The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during STS-48 in September 1991,Rob Matson, \\"Satellite Encounters\\" Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page. a seven-second thruster burn to avoid debris from the derelict satellite Kosmos 955.\\"STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report\\" , NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991. Similar maneuvers were initiated on missions 53, 72 and 82. One of the earliest events to publicize the debris problem occurred on 's second flight, STS-7. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over wide. On STS-59 in 1994, Endeavour's front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998. Window chipping and minor damage to thermal protection system tiles (TPS) were already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take a greater proportion of the debris load on the engines and rear cargo bay, which are not used in orbit or during descent, and thus are less critical for post-launch operation. When flying attached to the ISS, the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter. had a major impact on its radiator during STS-118. The entry hole is about , and the exit hole is twice as large. A NASA 2009 study concluded that debris accounted for approximately half of the overall risk to the Shuttle.Kelly, John. \\"Debris is Shuttle's Biggest Threat\\" , space.com, 5 March 2005.\\"Debris Danger\\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, Volume 169 Number 10 (15 September 2008), p. 18. Executive-level decision to proceed was required if catastrophic impact was likelier than 1 in 200. On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was approximately 1 in 300, but the Hubble telescope repair mission was flown at the higher orbital altitude of where the risk was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 (due in part to the 2009 satellite collision). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.William Harwood, \\"Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris\\" , CBS News, 16 April 2009.

Debris impacts on Mir solar panels degraded their performance. The damage is most noticeable on the panel on the right, which is facing the camera with a high degree of contrast. Extensive damage to the smaller panel below is due to impact with a Progress spacecraft. = International Space Station = The ISS also uses Whipple shielding to protect its interior from minor debris.K Thoma et al, \\"New Protection Concepts for Meteoroid / Debris Shields\\" , Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587), 18‚Äì20 April 2005, p. 445. However, exterior portions (notably its solar panels) cannot be protected easily. In 1989, the ISS panels were predicted to degrade approximately 0.23% in four years due to the \\"sandblasting\\" effect of impacts with small orbital debris.Henry Nahra, \\"Effect of Micrometeoroid and Space Debris Impacts on the Space Station Freedom Solar Array Surfaces\\" .

An avoidance maneuver is typically performed for the ISS if \\"there is a greater than one-in-10,000 chance of a debris strike\\". , there have been sixteen maneuvers in the fifteen years the ISS had been in orbit. As another method to reduce the risk to humans on board, ISS operational management asked the crew to shelter in the Soyuz on three occasions due to late debris- proximity warnings. In addition to the sixteen thruster firings and three Soyuz-capsule shelter orders, one attempted maneuver was not completed due to not having the several days' warning necessary to upload the maneuver timeline to the station's computer.\\"Junk alert for space station crew\\" , BBC News, 12 March 2009.\\"International Space Station in debris scare\\" , BBC News, 28 June 2011.

In 2013, the ISS operations management did not make a maneuver to avoid any debris, after making a record four debris maneuvers the previous year.  Kessler syndrome  The Kessler syndrome, proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, is a theoretical scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade effect where each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions. He further theorized that one implication if this were to occur is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render space activities and the use of satellites in specific orbital ranges economically impractical for many generations. The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,Kessler 2001 the LEO environment in the altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major satellite collision incident has occurred: the 2009 satellite collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.Technical According to Kessler in 2010 however, a cascade may not be obvious until it is well advanced, which might take years.Jan Stupl et al, \\"Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers\\", 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18‚Äì19 October 2010, see graph p. 4 = On Earth = Saudi officials inspect a crashed PAM-D module in January 2001. Although most debris burns up in the atmosphere, larger debris objects can reach the ground intact. According to NASA, an average of one cataloged piece of debris has fallen back to Earth each day for the past 50 years.

In addition to natural atmospheric effects, corporations, academics and government agencies have proposed plans and technology to deal with space debris, but , most of these are theoretical, and there is no extant business plan for debris reduction. A number of scholars have also observed that institutional factors‚Äîpolitical, legal, economic and cultural \\"rules of the game\\"‚Äîare the greatest impediment to the cleanup of near-Earth space. There is no commercial incentive, since costs aren't assigned to polluters, but a number of suggestions have been made. However, effects to date are limited. In the US, governmental bodies have been accused of backsliding on previous commitments to limit debris growth, \\"let alone tackling the more complex issues of removing orbital debris.\\" The different methods for removal of space debris has been evalauted by the Space Generation Advisory Council, including French astrophysicist Fatoumata K√©b√©. = Growth mitigation = Spatial density of LEO space debris by altitude, according to 2011 a NASA report to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs Spatial density of space debris by altitude according to ESA MASTER-2001, without debris from the Chinese ASAT and 2009 collision events As of the 2010s, several technical approaches to the mitigation of the growth of space debris are typically undertaken, yet no comprehensive legal regime or cost assignment structure is in place to reduce space debris in the way that terrestrial pollution has reduced since the mid-20th century. To avoid excessive creation of artificial space debris, many‚Äîbut not all‚Äîsatellites launched to above-low-Earth-orbit are launched initially into elliptical orbits with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so the orbit will quickly decay and the satellites then will destroy themselves upon reentry into the atmosphere. Other methods are used for spacecraft in higher orbits. These include passivation of the spacecraft at the end of its useful life; as well as use of upper stages that can reignite to decelerate the stage to intentionally deorbit it, often on the first or second orbit following payload release; satellites that can, if they remain healthy for years, deorbit themselves from the lower orbits around Earth. Other satellites (such as many CubeSats) in low orbits below approximately 400 km orbital altitude depend on the energy-absorbing effects of the upper atmosphere to reliably deorbit a spacecraft within weeks or months. Increasingly, spent upper stages in higher orbits‚Äîorbits for which low-delta-v deorbit is not possible, or not planned for‚Äîand architectures that support satellite passivation, at end of life are passivated at end of life. This removes any internal energy contained in the vehicle at the end of its mission or useful life. While this does not remove the debris of the now derelict rocket stage or satellite itself, it does substantially reduce the likelihood of the spacecraft destructing and creating many smaller pieces of space debris, a phenomenon that was common in many of the early generations of US and Soviet spacecraft. Upper stage passivation (e.g. of Delta boosters) by releasing residual propellants reduces debris from orbital explosions; however even as late as 2011, not all upper stages implement this practice. SpaceX used the term \\"propulsive passivation\\" for the final maneuver of their six- hour demonstration mission (STP-2) of the Falcon 9 second stage for the US Air Force in 2019, but did not define what all that term encompassed. When originally proposed in 2015, the OneWeb constellation, initially planned to have ~700 satellites anticipated on orbit after 2018, would only state that they would re-enter the atmosphere within 25 years of retirement, which would comply with the Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP) issued by the US government in 2001. By October 2017, both OneWeb‚Äîand also SpaceX, with their large Starlink constellation‚Äîhad filed documents with the US FCC with more aggressive space debris mitigation plans. Both companies committed to a deorbit plan for post-mission satellites which will explicitly move the satellites into orbits where they will reenter the Earth's atmosphere within approximately one year following end-of-life. With a \\"one-up, one-down\\" launch-license policy for Earth orbits, launchers would rendezvous with, capture and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane. Another possibility is the robotic refueling of satellites. Experiments have been flown by NASA, and SpaceX is developing large-scale on-orbit propellant transfer technology. Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second- stage in an elliptical geocentric orbit with a low-perigee, thus ensuring rapid orbital decay and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies. Such missions will often complete the payload placement in a final orbit by the use of low-thrust electric propulsion or with the use of a small kick stage to circularize the orbit. The kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit. = Self- removal = Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris. Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit. This was done with the French Spot-1 satellite, reducing its atmospheric re-entry time from a projected 200 years to about 15 by lowering its altitude from to about .Luc Moliner, \\"Spot-1 Earth Observation Satellite Deorbitation\\" , AIAA, 2002.\\"Spacecraft: Spot 3\\" , agi, 2003 The Iridium constellation‚Äî95 communication satellites launched during the five-year period between 1997 and 2002‚Äîprovides a set of data points on the limits of self-removal. The satellite operator‚ÄîIridium Communications‚Äîremained operational (albeit with a company name change through a corporate bankruptcy during the period) over the two-decade life of the satellites, and by December 2019, had \\"completed disposal of the last of its 65 working legacy satellites.\\" However, this process left nearly one-third of the mass of this constellation (30 satellites, of materiel) in LEO orbits at approximately altitude, where self- decay is quite slow. 29 of these satellites simply failed during their time in orbit and were thus unable to self-deorbit, while one‚ÄîIridium 33‚Äîwas involved in the 2009 satellite collision with the derelict Russian military Kosmos-2251 satellite. No \\"Plan B\\" provision was designed in for removal of the satellites that were unable to remove themselves. However, in 2019, Iridium CEO Matt Desch said that Iridium would be willing to pay an active-debris-removal company to deorbit its remaining first-generation satellites if it were possible for a sufficiently low cost, say \\" per deorbit, but [he] acknowledged that price would likely be far below what a debris-removal company could realistically offer. 'You know at what point [it‚Äôs] a no-brainer, but [I] expect the cost is really in the millions or tens of millions, at which price I know it doesn‚Äôt make sense\\" Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed.

Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions. Moreover, , the cost of any of the proposed approaches for external removal is about the same as launching a spacecraft and, according to NASA's Nicholas Johnson, not cost- effective. This is beginning to change in the late 2010s, as some companies have made plans to begin to do external removal on their satellites in mid-LEO orbits. For example, OneWeb will utilize on-board self-removal as \\"plan A\\" for satellite deorbiting at the end of life, but if a satellite is unable to remove itself within one year of end of life, OneWeb will implement \\"plan B\\" and dispatch a reusable (multi-transport mission) space tug to attach to the satellite at an already built-in capture target via a grappling fixture, to be towed to a lower orbit and released for reentry.  Remotely controlled vehicles  A well-studied solution uses a remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with, capture and return debris to a central station.Erika Carlson et al, \\"Final design of a space debris removal system\\", NASA/CR-189976, 1990. One such system is Space Infrastructure Servicing, a commercially developed refueling depot and service spacecraft for communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit originally scheduled for a 2015 launch.\\"Intelsat Picks MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. for Satellite Servicing\\" , CNW Newswire, 15 March 2011.

The Advanced Common Evolved Stage family of upper stages is being designed with a high leftover-propellant margin (for derelict capture and de- orbit) and in-space refueling capability for the high delta-v required to de- orbit heavy objects from geosynchronous orbit.Frank Zegler and Bernard Kutter, \\"Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture\\", AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition, 30 August-2 September 2010, AIAA 2010‚Äì8638. A tug- like satellite to drag debris to a safe altitude for it to burn up in the atmosphere has been researched. When debris is identified the satellite creates a difference in potential between the debris and itself, then using its thrusters to move itself and the debris to a safer orbit. A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, capture it temporarily to attach a smaller de-orbit satellite and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location. The \\"mothership\\" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for atmospheric entry or move it to a graveyard orbit. One such system is the proposed Busek ORbital DEbris Remover (ORDER), which would carry over 40 SUL (satellite on umbilical line) de-orbit satellites and propellant sufficient for their removal. Cleanspace One On 7 January 2010 Star, Inc. reported that it received a contract from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command for a feasibility study of the ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator (EDDE) propellantless spacecraft for space- debris removal.\\"News\\" , Star Inc. Retrieved 18 July 2011. In February 2012 the Swiss Space Center at √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne announced the Clean Space One project, a nanosatellite demonstration project for matching orbit with a defunct Swiss nanosatellite, capturing it and de-orbiting together. The mission has seen several evolutions to reach a pac-man inspired capture model. In 2013, Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris was studied. In December 2019, the European Space Agency awarded the first contract to clean up space debris. The ‚Ç¨120 million mission dubbed ClearSpace-1 (a spinoff from the EPFL project) is slated to launch in 2025. It aims to remove a 100 kg VEga Secondary Payload Adapter (Vespa) left by Vega flight VV02 in an 800 km orbit in 2013. A \\"chaser\\" will grab the junk with four robotic arms and drag it down to Earth's atmosphere where both will burn up.  Laser methods  The laser broom uses a ground-based laser to ablate the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.Jonathan Campbell, \\"Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection\\" , Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000. During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.Ivan Bekey, \\"Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers.\\", Second European Conference on Space Debris, 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699. Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.Justin Mullins \\"A clean sweep: NASA plans to carry out a spot of housework.\\", New Scientist, 16 August 2000. The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, \\"There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report. There's a reason why it's been sitting on the shelf for more than a decade.\\"Tony Reichhardt, \\"Satellite Smashers\\" , Air & Space Magazine, 1 March 2008. The momentum of the laser-beam photons could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by per day.James Mason et al, \\"Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance\\" , arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011. One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem. A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit, using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry. A proposal to replace the laser with an Ion Beam Shepherd has been made,C. Bombardelli and J. Pel√°ez, \\"Ion Beam Shepherd for Contactless Space Debris Removal\\".

Since 2012, the European Space Agency has been working on the design of a mission to remove large space debris from orbit. The mission, e.Deorbit, is scheduled for launch during 2023 with an objective to remove debris heavier than from LEO. Several capture techniques are being studied, including a net, a harpoon and a combination robot arm and clamping mechanism.Biesbroek, 2012 \\"Introduction to e.Deorbit\\" . e.deorbit symposium. 6 May 2014  Harpoon  The RemoveDEBRIS mission plan is to test the efficacy of several ADR technologies on mock targets in low Earth orbit. In order to complete its planned experiments the platform is equipped with a net, a harpoon, a laser ranging instrument, a dragsail, and two CubeSats (miniature research satellites). The mission was launched on 2 April 2018. = National and international regulation = There is no international treaty minimizing space debris. However, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) published voluntary guidelines in 2007,\\"UN Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\\" , UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, 2010. using a variety of earlier national regulatory attempts at developing standards for debris mitigation. As of 2008, the committee was discussing international \\"rules of the road\\" to prevent collisions between satellites.Theresa Hitchens, \\"COPUOS Wades into the Next Great Space Debate\\" , The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 26 June 2008. By 2013, a number of national legal regimes existed, \\"Orbital Debris ‚Äì Important Reference Documents.\\" , NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. typically instantiated in the launch licenses that are required for a launch in all spacefaring nations. The U.S. issued a set of standard practices for civilian (NASA) and military (DoD and USAF) orbital-debris mitigation in 2001. The standard envisioned disposal for final mission orbits in one of three ways: 1) atmospheric reentry where even with \\"conservative projections for solar activity, atmospheric drag will limit the lifetime to no longer than 25 years after completion of mission;\\" 2) maneuver to a \\"storage orbit:\\" move the spacecraft to one of four very broad parking orbit ranges (, , above , or out of Earth orbit completely and into any heliocentric orbit; 3) \\"Direct retrieval: Retrieve the structure and remove it from orbit as soon as practicable after completion of mission.\\" The standard articulated in option 1, which is the standard applicable to most satellites and derelict upper stages launched, has come to be known as the \\"25-year rule.\\" The US updated the ODMSP in December 2019, but made no change to the 25-year rule even though \\"[m]any in the space community believe that the timeframe should be less than 25 years.\\" There is no consensus however on what any new timeframe might be. In 2002, the European Space Agency (ESA) worked with an international group to promulgate a similar set of standards, also with a \\"25-year rule\\" applying to most Earth-orbit satellites and upper stages. Space agencies in Europe began to develop technical guidelines in the mid-1990s, and ASI, UKSA, CNES, DLR and ESA signed a \\"European Code of Conduct\\" in 2006, which was a predecessor standard to the ISO international standard work that would begin the following year. In 2008, ESA further developed \\"its own \\"Requirements on Space Debris Mitigation for Agency Projects\\" which \\"came into force on 1 April 2008.\\" Germany and France have posted bonds to safeguard the property from debris damage.Howell, E. (2013). Experts Urge Removal of Space Debris From Orbit. Universe Today. Retrieved from http://www.universetoday.com/101790/experts- urge-removal-of-space-debris-from-orbit/ The \\"direct retrieval\\" option (option no. 3 in the US \\"standard practices\\" above) has rarely been done by any spacefaring nation (exception, USAF X-37) or commercial actor since the earliest days of spaceflight due to the cost and complexity of achieving direct retrieval, but the ESA has scheduled a 2025 demonstration mission (Clearspace-1) to do this with a single small derelict upper stage at a projected cost of ‚Ç¨120 million not including the launch costs. By 2006, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) had developed a number of technical means of debris mitigation (upper stage passivation, propellant reserves for movement to graveyard orbits, etc.) for ISRO launch vehicles and satellites, and was actively contributing to inter-agency debris coordination and the efforts of the UN COPUOS committee.Space debris mitigation measures in India , Acta Astronautica, February 2006, Vol. 58, Issue 3, pages 168-174, DOI. In 2007, the ISO began preparing an international standard for space-debris mitigation.E A Taylor and J R Davey, \\"Implementation of debris mitigation using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards\\" , Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers: G, Volume 221 Number 8 (1 June 2007), pp. 987 ‚Äì 996. By 2010, ISO had published \\"a comprehensive set of space system engineering standards aimed at mitigating space debris. [with primary requirements] defined in the top-level standard, ISO 24113.\\" By 2017, the standards were nearly complete. However, these standards are not binding on any party by ISO or any international jurisdiction. They are simply available for use in any of a variety of voluntary ways. They \\"can be adopted voluntarily by a spacecraft manufacturer or operator, or brought into effect through a commercial contract between a customer and supplier, or used as the basis for establishing a set of national regulations on space debris mitigation.\\" The voluntary ISO standard also adopted the \\"25-year rule\\" for the \\"LEO protected region\\" below 2000 km altitude that has been previously (and still is, as of 2019) used by the US, ESA, and UN mitigation standards, and identifies it as \\"an upper limit for the amount of time that a space system shall remain in orbit after its mission is completed. Ideally, the time to deorbit should be as short as possible (i.e. much shorter than 25 years)\\". Holger Krag of the European Space Agency states that as of 2017 there is no binding international regulatory framework with no progress occurring at the respective UN body in Vienna.

The tribal areas that form the Assyrian homeland are parts of present-day northern Iraq (Nineveh Plains and Dohuk Governorate), southeastern Turkey (Hakkari and Tur Abdin), northwestern Iran (Urmia) and, more recently, northeastern Syria (Al-Hasakah Governorate). The majority have migrated to other regions of the world, including North America, the Levant, Australia, Europe, Russia and the Caucasus during the past century. Emigration was triggered by events such as the Massacres of Diyarbakƒ±r, the Assyrian Genocide (concurrent with the Armenian and Greek Genocides) during World War I by the Ottoman Empire and allied Kurdish tribes, the Simele Massacre in Iraq in 1933, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Arab Nationalist Ba'athist policies in Iraq and Syria, the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and its takeover of most of the Nineveh Plains. Assyrians are predominantly Christian, mostly adhering to the East and West Syrian liturgical rites of Christianity.For Assyrians as a Christian people, see * Joel J. Elias, The Genetics of Modern Assyrians and their Relationship to Other People of the Middle East * Steven L. Danver, Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures and Contemporary Issues, p. 517 The churches that constitute the East Syrian rite include the Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, and the Ancient Church of the East, whereas the churches of the West Syrian rite are the Syriac Orthodox Church and Syriac Catholic Church. Both rites use Classical Syriac as their liturgical language. Most recently, the post-2003 Iraq War and the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, have displaced much of the remaining Assyrian community from their homeland as a result of ethnic and religious persecution at the hands of Islamic extremists. Of the one million or more Iraqis reported by the United Nations to have fled Iraq since the occupation, nearly 40% were Assyrians even though Assyrians accounted for only around 3% of the pre-war Iraqi demography. Because of the emergence of ISIL and the taking over of much of the Assyrian homeland by the terror group, another major wave of Assyrian displacement has taken place. ISIL was driven out from the Assyrian villages in the Khabour River Valley and the areas surrounding the city of Al-Hasakah in Syria by 2015, and from the Nineveh plains in Iraq by 2017. In northern Syria, Assyrian groups have been taking part both politically and militarily in the Kurdish-dominated but multiethnic Syrian Democratic Forces (see Khabour Guards and Sutoro) and Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.  History  = Pre-Christian history = Part of the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, c. 645‚Äì635 BC Assyria is the homeland of the Assyrian people; it is located in the ancient Near East. In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to Neanderthals such as the remains of those which have been found at the Shanidar Cave. The earliest Neolithic sites in Assyria belonged to the Jarmo culture c. 7100 BC and Tell Hassuna, the centre of the Hassuna culture, c. 6000 BC. The history of Assyria begins with the formation of the city of Assur perhaps as early as the 25th century BC.Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq, p. 187 The Assyrian king list records kings dating from the 25th century BC onwards, the earliest being Tudiya, who was a contemporary of Ibrium of Ebla. However, many of these early kings would have been local rulers, and from the late 24th century BC to the early 22nd century BC, they were usually subjects of the Akkadian Empire. During the early Bronze Age period, Sargon of Akkad united all the native Semitic- speaking peoples (including the Assyrians) and the Sumerians of Mesopotamia under the Akkadian Empire (2335‚Äì2154 BC). The cities of Assur and Nineveh (modern day Mosul), which was the oldest and largest city of the ancient Assyrian Empire, together with a number of other towns and cities, existed as early as the 25th century BC, although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population. Assyrian soldier of the Achaemenid Army circa 480 BC, Xerxes I tomb, Naqsh-e Rustam. In the traditions of the Assyrian Church of the East, they are descended from Abraham's grandson (Dedan son of Jokshan), progenitor of the ancient Assyrians.Genesis 25:3 However, there is no historical basis for the biblical assertion whatsoever; there is no mention in Assyrian records (which date as far back as the 25th century BC). Ashur-uballit I overthrew the Mitanni c. 1365 BC, and the Assyrians benefited from this development by taking control of the eastern portion of Mitanni territory, and later also annexing Hittite, Babylonian, Amorite and Hurrian territories. The Assyrian people, after the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 609 BC were under the control of the Neo-Babylonian and later the Persian Empire, which consumed the entire Neo-Babylonian or \\"Chaldean\\" Empire in 539 BC. Assyrians became front line soldiers for the Persian Empire under Xerxes I, playing a major role in the Battle of Marathon under Darius I in 490 BC.\\"Artifacts show rivals Athens and Sparta\\", Yahoo News, December 5, 2006. Herodotus, whose Histories are the main source of information about that battle, makes no mention of Assyrians in connection with it. Despite the influx of foreign elements, the presence of Assyrians is confirmed by the worship of the god Ashur; references to the name survive into the 3rd century AD. The Greeks, Parthians, and Romans had a rather low level of integration with the local population in Mesopotamia, which allowed their cultures to survive.Olmatead, History of the Persian Empire, Chicago University Press, 1959, p.39 The kingdoms of Osroene, Adiabene, Hatra and Assur, which were under Parthian overlordship, had an Assyrian identity. Language Emerging in Sumer c. 3500 BC, cuneiform writing began as a system of pictograms. Around 3000 BC, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian (Babylonian and Assyrian) and Hittite languages.Visible Language. Inventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond, Oriental Institute Museum Publications, 32, Chicago: University of Chicago, p. 13, The K√ºltepe texts, which were written in Old Assyrian, preserve the earliest known traces of the Hittite language, and the earliest attestation of any Indo-European language, dated to the 20th century BC. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use of both cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence. To date, over 20,000 cuneiform tablets have been recovered from the site.E. Bilgic and S Bayram, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri II, Turk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1995, K. R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, From 1700 BC and onward, the Sumerian language was preserved by the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians only as a liturgical and classical language for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes. The Akkadian language, with its main dialects Assyrian and Babylonian, once the lingua franca of the Ancient Near East, began to decline during the Neo-Assyrian Empire around the 8th century BC, being marginalized by Old Aramaic during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III. By the Hellenistic period, the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia. =Early Christian period= Map of As≈çristƒÅn (226‚Äì637 AD) From the 1st century BC, Assyria was the theatre of the protracted Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars. Much of the region would become the Roman province of Assyria from 116 to 118 AD following the conquests of Trajan, but after a Parthian-inspired Assyrian rebellion, the new emperor Hadrian withdrew from the short-lived Roman province of Assyria and its neighboring provinces in 118 AD. Following a successful campaign in 197‚Äì198, Severus converted the kingdom of Osroene, centred on Edessa, into a frontier Roman province.Magie p. 674-5; Fergus Millar, The Roman Empire and its Neighbors, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967: p. 211. Roman influence in the area came to an end under Jovian in 363, who abandoned the region after concluding a hasty peace agreement with the Sassanians.Ammianus Marcellinus The Later Roman Empire (354-378) A shameful peace concluded by Jovian 6.7 pg.303, Penguin Classics, Translated by Walter Hamilton 1986 From the later 2nd century, the Roman Senate included several notable Assyrians, including Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus and Avidius Cassius. The Assyrians were Christianized in the first to third centuries in Roman Syria and Roman Assyria. The population of the Sasanian province of As≈çristƒÅn was a mixed one, composed of Assyrians, Arameans in the far south and the western deserts, and Persians. The Greek element in the cities, still strong during the Parthian Empire, ceased to be ethnically distinct in Sasanian times. The majority of the population were Eastern Aramaic speakers. Along with the Arameans, Armenians, Greeks, and Nabataeans, the Assyrians were among the first people to convert to Christianity and spread Eastern Christianity to the Far East in spite of becoming, from the 8th century, a minority religion in their homeland following the Muslim conquest of Persia. In 410, the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire,Seleucia-Ctesiphon is not to be confused with Seleucia Isauria (now Silifke, Turkey) within the Roman Empire, where, at the request of the Roman emperor, the Council of Seleucia was held in 359. organized the Christians within that empire into what became known as the Church of the East. Its head was declared to be the bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, who in the acts of the council was referred to as the Grand or Major Metropolitan, and who soon afterward was called the Catholicos of the East. Later, the title of Patriarch was also used. Dioceses were organised into provinces, each of which was under the authority of a metropolitan bishop. Six such provinces were instituted in 410. A 6th century church, St. John the Arab, in Hakkari, Turkey (Geramon). Another council held in 424 declared that the Catholicos of the East was independent of \\"western\\" ecclesiastical authorities (those of the Roman Empire). Soon afterwards, Christians in the Roman Empire were divided by their attitude regarding the Council of Ephesus (431), which condemned Nestorianism, and the Council of Chalcedon (451), which condemned Monophysitism. Those who for any reason refused to accept one or other of these councils were called Nestorians or Monophysites, while those who accepted both councils, held under the auspices of the Roman emperors, were called Melkites (derived from Syriac malkƒÅ, king), meaning royalists. All three groups existed among the Syriac Christians, the East Syriacs being called Nestorians and the West Syriacs being divided between the Monophysites (today the Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as Jacobites, after Jacob Baradaeus) and those who accepted both councils (primarily today's Orthodox Church, which has adopted the Byzantine Rite in Greek, but also the Maronite Church, which kept its West Syriac Rite and was not as closely aligned with Constantinople). After the division the East and West Syrians developed distinct dialects. With the rise of Syriac Christianity, eastern Aramaic enjoyed a renaissance as a classical language in the 2nd to 8th centuries, and varieties of that form of Aramaic (Neo-Aramaic languages) are still spoken by a few small groups of Jacobite and Nestorian Christians in the Middle East. = Arab conquest = The Assyrians initially experienced some periods of religious and cultural freedom interspersed with periods of severe religious and ethnic persecution after the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia. Assyrians contributed to Islamic civilizations during the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science (Qusta ibn Luqa, Masawaiyh, Eutychius of Alexandria, and Jabril ibn Bukhtishu) and theology (such as Tatian, Bardaisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, and Thomas of Marga) and the personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrians, such as the long-serving Bukhtishu dynasty.R√©mi Brague, Assyrians Contributions To The Islamic Civilization. (Archived: 27 September 2013) Many scholars of the House of Wisdom were of Assyrian Christian background.Hyman and Walsh Philosophy in the Middle Ages Indianapolis, 1973, p. 204' Meri, Josef W. and Jere L. Bacharach, Editors, Medieval Islamic Civilization Vol.1, A-K, Index, 2006, p. 304. Indigenous Assyrians became second-class citizens (dhimmi) in a greater Arab Islamic state, and those who resisted Arabisation and conversion to Islam were subject to severe religious, ethnic and cultural discrimination, and had certain restrictions imposed upon them.Clinton Bennett (2005). Muslims and Modernity: An Introduction to the Issues and Debates. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 162, 163. . Retrieved 2012-07-07 Assyrians were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, they did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters, as Christians they were subject to payment of a special tax (jizya), they were banned from spreading their religion further or building new churches in Muslim-ruled lands, but were also expected to adhere to the same laws of property, contract and obligation as the Muslim Arabs.H. Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 219. They couldn't seek conversion of a Muslim, a non-Muslim man couldn't marry a Muslim woman and the child of such a marriage would be considered Muslim. They couldn't own a Muslim slave and had to wear different clothing from Muslims in order to be distinguishable. In addition to the jizya tax, they were also required to pay the kharaj tax on their land which was heavier than the jizya. However they were ensured protection, given religious freedom and to govern themselves in accordance to their own laws. As non-Islamic proselytising was punishable by death under Sharia, the Assyrians were forced into preaching in Transoxiana, Central Asia, India, Mongolia and China where they established numerous churches. The Church of the East was considered to be one of the major Christian powerhouses in the world, alongside Latin Christianity in Europe and the Byzantine Empire. From the 7th century AD onwards Mesopotamia saw a steady influx of Arabs, Kurds and other Iranian peoples, and later Turkic peoples. Assyrians were increasingly marginalized, persecuted, and gradually became a minority in their own homeland. Conversion to Islam as a result of heavy taxation which also resulted in decreased revenue from their rulers. As a result, the new converts migrated to Muslim garrison towns nearby. Assyrians remained dominant in Upper Mesopotamia as late as the 14th centuryAccording to Georges Roux and Simo Parpola and the city of Ashur was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the Muslim Turco-Mongol ruler Timur conducted a religiously motivated massacre against Assyrians. After, there were no records of Assyrians remaining in Ashur according to the archaeological and numismatic record. From this point, the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland. From the 19th century, after the rise of nationalism in the Balkans, the Ottomans started viewing Assyrians and other Christians in their eastern front as a potential threat. The Kurdish Emirs sought to consolidate their power by attacking Assyrian communities which were already well- established there. Scholars estimate that tens of thousands of Assyrian in the Hakkari region were massacred in 1843 when Bedr Khan Beg, the emir of Bohtan, invaded their region.David Gaunt, Massacres, resistance, protectors: Muslim- Christian relations in Eastern, pp. 32 After a later massacre in 1846, the Ottomans were forced by the western powers into intervening in the region, and the ensuing conflict destroyed the Kurdish emirates and reasserted the Ottoman power in the area. The Assyrians were subject to the massacres of Diyarbakƒ±r soon after. Being culturally, ethnically, and linguistically distinct from their Muslim neighbors in the Middle East‚Äîthe Arabs, Persians, Kurds, Turks‚Äîthe Assyrians have endured much hardship throughout their recent history as a result of religious and ethnic persecution by these groups. =Mongolian and Turkic rule= Aramaic language and Syriac Christianity in the Middle East and Central Asia until being largely annihilated by Tamerlane in the 14th century After initially coming under the control of the Seljuk Empire and the Buyid dynasty, the region eventually came under the control of the Mongol Empire after the fall of Baghdad in 1258. The Mongol khans were sympathetic with Christians and did not harm them. The most prominent among them was probably Isa Kelemechi, a diplomat, astrologer, and head of the Christian affairs in Yuan China. He spent some time in Persia under the Ilkhanate. The 14th century massacres of Timur devastated the Assyrian people. Timur's massacres and pillages of all that was Christian drastically reduced their existence. At the end of the reign of Timur, the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places. Toward the end of the thirteenth century, Bar Hebraeus, the noted Assyrian scholar and hierarch, found \\"much quietness\\" in his diocese in Mesopotamia. Syria's diocese, he wrote, was \\"wasted.\\" The region was later controlled by the in Iran-based Turkic confederations of the Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu. Subsequently, all Assyrians, like with the rest of the ethnicities living in the former Aq Qoyunlu territories, fell into Safavid hands from 1501 and on. = From Iranian Safavid to confirmed Ottoman rule = Mar Elias (Eliya), the Nestorian bishop of the Urmia plain village of Geogtapa, c.1831 The Ottomans secured their control over Mesopotamia and Syria in the first half of the 17th century following the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì39) and the resulting Treaty of Zuhab. Non-Muslims were organised into millets. Syriac Christians, however, were often considered one millet alongside Armenians until the 19th century, when Nestorian, Syriac Orthodox and Chaldeans gained that right as well.The Blackwell companion to Eastern Christianity, Kenneth Parry The Aramaic- speaking Mesopotamian Christians had long been divided between followers of the Church of the East, commonly referred to as \\"Nestorians\\", and followers of the Syriac Orthodox Church, commonly called Jacobites. The latter were organised by Marutha of Tikrit (565‚Äì649) as 17 dioceses under a \\"Metropolitan of the East\\" or \\"Maphrian\\", holding the highest rank in the Syriac Orthodox Church after that of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch and All the East. The Maphrian resided at Tikrit until 1089, when he moved to the city of Mosul for half a century, before settling in the nearby Monastery of Mar Mattai (still belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church) and thus not far from the residence of the Eliya line of Patriarchs of the Church of the East. From 1533, the holder of the office was known as the Maphrian of Mosul, to distinguish him from the Maphrian of the Patriarch of Tur Abdin.\\"Maphrian Catholicos [Syr. Orth.\\" in Gorgias Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Syriac Heritage In 1552, a group of bishops of the Church of the East from the northern regions of Amid and Salmas, who were dissatisfied with reservation of patriarchal succession to members of a single family, even if the designated successor was little more than a child, elected as a rival patriarch the abbot of the Rabban Hormizd Monastery, Yohannan Sulaqa. This was by no means the first schism in the Church of the East. An example is the attempt to replace Timothy I (779‚Äì823) with Ephrem of Gandƒ´sƒÅbur.Adrian Fortescue, The Lesser Eastern Churches, chapter 4 By tradition, a patriarch could be ordained only by someone of archiepiscopal (metropolitan) rank, a rank to which only members of that one family were promoted. For that reason, Sulaqa travelled to Rome, where, presented as the new patriarch elect, he entered communion with the Catholic Church and was ordained by the Pope and recognized as patriarch. The title or description under which he was recognized as patriarch is given variously as \\"Patriarch of Mosul in Eastern Syria\\";Patriarcha de Mozal in Syria orientali (Anton Baumstark (editor), Oriens Christianus, IV:1, Rome and Leipzig 2004, p. 277) \\"Patriarch of the Church of the Chaldeans of Mosul\\";Chaldaeorum ecclesiae Musal Patriarcha (Giuseppe Simone Assemani (editor), Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana (Rome 1725), vol. 3, part 1, p. 661) \\"Patriarch of the Chaldeans\\";\\"L'√âglise nestorienne in Dictionnaire de th√©ologie catholique (Librairie Letourzey et An√© (1931), vol. XI, col. 228 \\"patriarch of Mosul\\";Mar Aprem Mooken, The History of the Assyrian Church of the East (St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute, 2000), p. 33 or \\"patriarch of the Eastern Assyrians\\", this last being the version given by Pietro Strozzi on the second-last unnumbered page before page 1 of his De Dogmatibus Chaldaeorum, of which an English translation is given in Adrian Fortescue's Lesser Eastern Churches.A Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia (Eyre & Spottiswoode 1939), vol. I, pp. 382‚Äì383In his contribution \\"Myth vs. Reality\\" to JAA Studies, Vol. XIV, No. 1, 2000 p. 80, George V. Yana (Bebla) presented as a \\"correction\\" of Strozzi's statement a quotation from an unrelated source (cf. p. xxiv) that Sulaqa was called \\"Patriarch of the Chaldeans\\". Mar Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa returned to northern Mesopotamia in the same year and fixed his seat in Amid. Before being imprisoned for four months and then in January 1555 put to death by the governor of Amadiya at the instigation of the rival patriarch of Alqosh, the Aliya line, he ordained two metropolitans and three other bishops, thus beginning a new ecclesiastical hierarchy: the patriarchal line known as the Shimun line. The area of influence of this patriarchate soon moved from Amid east, fixing the see, after many changes, in the isolated village of Qochanis. massacre of Armenians and Assyrians in the city of Adana, Ottoman Empire, April 1909 The Shimun line eventually drifted away from Rome and in 1662 adopted a profession of faith incompatible with that of Rome. Leadership of those who wished communion with Rome passed to the Archbishop of Amid Joseph I, recognized first by the Turkish civil authorities (1677) and then by Rome itself (1681). A century and a half later, in 1830, headship of the Catholics (the Chaldean Catholic Church) was conferred on Yohannan Hormizd, a member of the family that for centuries had provided the patriarchs of the legitimist \\"Eliya line\\", who had won over most of the followers of that line. Thus the patriarchal line of those who in 1553 entered communion with Rome are now patriarchs of the \\"traditionalist\\" wing of the Church of the East, that which in 1976 officially adopted the name \\"Assyrian Church of the East\\". In the 1840s many of the Assyrians living in the mountains of Hakkari in the south eastern corner of the Ottoman Empire were massacred by the Kurdish emirs of Hakkari and Bohtan. Another major massacre of Assyrians (and Armenians) in the Ottoman Empire occurred between 1894 and 1897 by Turkish troops and their Kurdish allies during the rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert Pan-Islamism in the Ottoman Empire, resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. Assyrians were massacred in Diyarbakir, Hasankeyef, Sivas and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced \\"Ottomanisation\\" of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by Kurds. Unarmed Assyrian women and children were raped, tortured and murdered.  World War I and aftermath  Assyrian flag, c. 1920 The burning of bodies of Assyrian women The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries,Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218‚Äì219. . culminating in the large-scale Hamidian massacres of unarmed men, women and children by Muslim Turks and Kurds in the late 19th century at the hands of the Ottoman Empire and its associated (largely Kurdish and Arab) militias, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey. The most significant recent persecution against the Assyrian population was the Assyrian genocide which occurred during the First World War. Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population. This led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, Iran, and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as Armenia, Georgia and Russia.The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? - Page 51 by United States CongressThe Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum ‚Äì Page 272 edited by Richard HovannisianNot Even My Name: A True Story ‚Äì Page 131 by Thea HaloThe Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G. Korbani In reaction to the Assyrian Genocide and lured by British and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by Agha Petros and Malik Khoshaba of the Bit-Tyari tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces in an Assyrian war of independence. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I. = Modern history = Khabur River in Syria The majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the Turkish War of Independence. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of Iraq and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader Shimun XXI Eshai asked the League of Nations to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the \\"Assyrian triangle\\" in northern Iraq. During the French mandate period, some Assyrians, fleeing ethnic cleansings in Iraq during the Simele massacre, established numerous villages along the Khabur River during the 1930s. The Assyrian Levies were founded by the British in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as Rab- shakeh, Rab-talia and Tartan, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline,Len Dieghton, Blood Sweat and Tears and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During World War II, eleven Assyrian companies saw action in Palestine and another four served in Cyprus. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and were involved in fighting in Albania, Italy and Greece. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-Nazi Iraqi forces at the battle of Habbaniya in 1941. However, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed Kingdom of Iraq. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele Massacre by the Iraqi Army in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of Shimun XXI Eshai the Catholicos Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East to the United States where resided until his death in 1975. Celebration at a Syriac Orthodox monastery in Mosul, Ottoman Syria, early 20th century The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President Abd al-Karim Qasim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports. The Ba'ath Party seized power in Iraq and Syria in 1963, introducing laws aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity via arabization policies. The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as Iraqi/Syrian Christians. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church). In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the Zowaa movement within the Assyrian Democratic Movement took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of Yonadam Kanna, and then joined up with the Iraqi- Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the Saddam Hussein Ba'ath government for many years. The Anfal campaign of 1986‚Äì1989 in Iraq, which was intended to target Kurdish opposition, resulted in 2,000 Assyrians being murdered through its gas campaigns. Over 31 towns and villages, 25 Assyrian monasteries and churches were razed to the ground. Some Assyrians were murdered, others were deported to large cities, and their lands and homes then being appropriated by Arabs and Kurds.The Anfal Offensives , indict.org.uk  21st century  Assyrian Genocide Memorial in Yerevan, Armenia Since the 2003 Iraq War social unrest and chaos have resulted in the unprovoked persecution of Assyrians in Iraq, mostly by Islamic extremists (both Shia and Sunni) and Kurdish nationalists (ex. Dohuk Riots of 2011 aimed at Assyrians & Yazidis). In places such as Dora, a neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, the majority of its Assyrian population has either fled abroad or to northern Iraq, or has been murdered. Islamic resentment over the United States' occupation of Iraq, and incidents such as the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons and the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy, have resulted in Muslims attacking Assyrian communities. Since the start of the Iraq war, at least 46 churches and monasteries have been bombed. In recent years, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and northeast Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked Islamic terrorism. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by Al Qaeda, the Islamic State (ISIL), Nusra Front and other terrorist Islamic Fundamentalist groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIL attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the Assyrian Homeland of northern Iraq, together with cities such as Mosul and Kirkuk which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIL terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, Ethnic Cleansing, robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non Muslims. Assyrians in Iraq have responded by forming armed militias to defend their territories. In response to the Islamic State's invasion of the Assyrian homeland in 2014, many Assyrian organizations also formed their own independent fighting forces to combat ISIL and potentially retake their \\"ancestral lands.\\" These include the Nineveh Plain Protection Units,John Burger for Aletia. December 4, 2014 Christians in Iraq Forming Militia to Defend, and Possibly Retake, Ancestral LandsSteven Nelson for US News and World Report. Feb. 6, 2015 Iraqi Assyrian Christians Form Anti-ISIS Militia, and You Can Legally Chip In Dwekh Nawsha, and the Nineveh Plain Forces. The latter two of these militias were eventually disbanded. In Syria, the Dawronoye modernization movement has influenced Assyrian identity in the region. The largest proponent of the movement, the Syriac Union Party (SUP) has become a major political actor in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria. In August 2016, the Ourhi Centre in the city of Zalin was started by the Assyrian community, to educate teachers in order to make Syriac an optional language of instruction in public schools, which then started with the 2016/17 academic year. With that academic year, states the Rojava Education Committee, \\"three curriculums have replaced the old one, to include teaching in three languages: Kurdish, Arabic and Assyrian.\\" Associated with the SUP is the Syriac Military Council, an Assyrian militia operating in Syria, established in January 2013 to protect and stand up for the national rights of Assyrians in Syria as well as working together with the other communities in Syria to change the current government of Bashar al- Assad.Syriacs establish military council in Syria, H√ºrriyet Daily News, 2 February 2013 Since 2015 it is a component of the Syrian Democratic Forces. However, many Assyrians and the organizations that represent them, particularly those outside of Syria, are critical of the Dawronoye movement. Assyrian activist organizations such as the Assyrian Policy Institute are critical of the fact that the movement is funded and controlled entirely by the PKK and the PYD, and claim that the movement exists to serve the interests of those groups. A report by the Assyrian International News Agency alleged that the leadership of the Dawronoye movement had engaged in numerous cases of abuses of the Assyrian people, including: The report concluded that the Dawronoye movement existed to create a sense of pluralism and inclusion of Assyrians to the outside world by Kurdish leadership in Syria. They also claim that it serves to advance Kurdish-nationalist interests within the Assyrian community of Syria. A 2018 report stated that Kurdish authorities in Syria, in conjunction with Dawronoye officials, had shut down several Assyrian schools in Northern Syria and fired their administration. This was said to be because these schooled failed to register for a license and for rejecting the new curriculum approved by the Education Authority. Closure methods ranged from officially shutting down schools to having armed men enter the schools and shut them down forcefully. An Assyrian educator named Isa Rashid was later badly beaten outside of his home for rejecting the Kurdish self- administration‚Äôs curriculum. The Assyrian Policy Institute claimed that an Assyrian reporter named Souleman Yusph was arrested by Kurdish forces for his reports on the Dawronoye-related school closures in Syria. Specifically, he had shared numerous photographs on Facebook detailing the closures.

Those who survived fled to unaffected areas of Assyrian settlement in Northern Iraq, with others settling in Iraqi cities to the south. Though many also immigrated to neighbouring countries in and around the Caucasus and Middle East like Armenia, Syria, Georgia, southern Russia, Lebanon and Jordan. In ancient times, Akkadian-speaking Assyrians have existed in what is now Syria, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon, among other modern countries, due to the sprawl of the Neo-Assyrian empire in the region. Though recent settlement of Christian Assyrians in Nisabina, Qamishli, Al-Hasakah, Al-Qahtaniyah, Al Darbasiyah, Al- Malikiyah, Amuda, Tel Tamer and a few other small towns in Al-Hasakah Governorate in Syria, occurred in the early 1930s,Betts, Robert Brenton, Christians in the Arab East (Atlanta, 1978) when they fled from Northern Iraq after they were targeted and slaughtered during the Simele massacre.Dodge, Bayard, \\"The Settlement of the Assyrians on the Khabur,\\" Royal Central Asian Society Journal, July 1940, pp. 301-320.

Sizable Assyrian populations only remain in Syria, where an estimated 400,000 Assyrians live, and in Iraq, where an estimated 300,000 Assyrians live. In Iran and Turkey, only small populations remain, with only 20,000 Assyrians in Iran, and a small but growing Assyrian population in Turkey, where 25,000 Assyrians live, mostly in the cities and not the ancient settlements. In Tur Abdin, a traditional center of Assyrian culture, there are only 2,500 Assyrians left.Atto, N. (2011). Hostages in the homeland, orphans in the diaspora. Leiden University. p. 83 Down from 50,000 in the 1960 census, but up from 1,000 in 1992. This sharp decline is due to an intense conflict between Turkey and the PKK in the 1980s. However, there are an estimated 25,000 Assyrians in all of Turkey, with most living in Istanbul. Most Assyrians currently reside in the West due to the centuries of persecution by the neighboring Muslims. Prior to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, in a 2013 report by a Chaldean Syriac Assyrian Popular Council official, it was estimated that 300,000 Assyrians remained in Iraq. =Assyrian subgroups= There are three main Assyrian subgroups: Eastern, Western, Chaldean. These subdivisions are only partially overlapping linguistically, historically, culturally, and religiously. * The Eastern subgroup historically inhabited Hakkari in the northern Zagros Mountains, the Simele and Sapna valleys in Nuhadra, and parts of the Nineveh and Urmia Plains. They speak Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects and are religiously diverse, adhering to the East Syriac churches,Minahan 2002, p. 209 Protestantism, Judaism, or are irreligious. * The Chaldean subgroup is a subgroup of the Eastern one. The group is often equated with the adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church, however not all Chaldean Catholics identify as Chaldean. They are traditionally speakers of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects, however there are some Turoyo speakers. In Iraq, Chaldean Catholics inhabit the western Nineveh Plains villages of Alqosh, Batnaya, Tel Keppe and Tesqopa, as well as the Nahla valley and Aqra. In Syria they live in Aleppo and the Al-Hasakah Governorate.

Map depicting Assyrian relocation after Seyfo in 1914 = Persecution = Due to their Christian faith and ethnicity, the Assyrians have been persecuted since their adoption of Christianity. During the reign of Yazdegerd I, Christians in Persia were viewed with suspicion as potential Roman subversives, resulting in persecutions while at the same time promoting Nestorian Christianity as a buffer between the Churches of Rome and Persia. Persecutions and attempts to impose Zoroastrianism continued during the reign of Yazdegerd II.This History of the Medieval World by Susan Wise Bauer, pg. 85-87A Short World History of Christianity by Robert Bruce Mullin, pp. 82-85 During the eras of Mongol rule under Genghis Khan and Timur, there was indiscriminate slaughter of tens of thousands of Assyrians and destruction of the Assyrian population of northwestern Iran and central and northern Iran. More recent persecutions since the 19th century include the Massacres of Badr Khan, the Massacres of Diyarbakƒ±r (1895), the Adana massacre, the Assyrian genocide, the Simele Massacre, and the al-Anfal campaign. = Diaspora = thumbupright=1.15Assyrian world population Since the Assyrian genocide, many Assyrians have left the Middle East entirely for a more safe and comfortable life in the countries of the Western world. As a result of this, the Assyrian population in the Middle East has decreased dramatically. As of today there are more Assyrians in the diaspora than in their homeland. The largest Assyrian diaspora communities are found in Sweden (100,000),Demographics of Sweden, Swedish Language Council \\"Sweden has also one of the largest exile communities of Assyrian and Syriac Christians (also known as Chaldeans) with a population of around 100,000.\\" Germany (100,000), the United States (80,000), and in Australia (46,000).Assyrian Australian Association & Ettinger House 1997, Settlement Issues of the Assyrian Community, AAA, Sydney. By ethnic percentage, the largest Assyrian diaspora communities are located in S√∂dert√§lje in Stockholm County, Sweden, and in Fairfield City in Sydney, Australia, where they are the leading ethnic group in the suburbs of Fairfield, Fairfield Heights, Prairiewood and Greenfield Park.Fairfield City Council 2003, State of the Community Report, Fairfield City Council, Wakeley.Kinarah: Twentieth Anniversary of Assyrian Australian Association 1989, Assyrian Australian Association, Edensor Park. There is also a sizable Assyrian community in Melbourne, Australia (Broadmeadows, Meadow Heights and Craigieburn)Deniz, F. 2000, ‚ÄòMaintenance and Transformation of Ethnic Identity: the Assyrian Case‚Äô, The Assyrian Australian Academic Journal In the United States, Assyrians are mostly found in Chicago (Niles and Skokie), Detroit (Sterling Heights, and West Bloomfield Township), Phoenix, Modesto (Stanislaus County) and Turlock.Thrown to the Lions , Doug Bandow, The America Spectator Furthermore, small Assyrian communities are found in San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno in the United States, Toronto in Canada and also in London, UK (London Borough of Ealing). In Germany, pocket-sized Assyrian communities are scattered throughout Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Berlin and Wiesbaden. In Paris, France, the commune of Sarcelles has a small number of Assyrians. Assyrians in the Netherlands mainly live in the east of the country, in the province of Overijssel. In Russia, small groups of Assyrians mostly reside in Krasnodar Kray and Moscow. To note, the Assyrians residing in California and Russia tend to be from Iran, whilst those in Chicago and Sydney are predominantly Iraqi Assyrians. More recently, Syrian Assyrians are growing in size in Sydney after a huge influx of new arrivals in 2016, who were granted asylum under the Federal Government's special humanitarian intake.The facts about Syrian refugees and Fairfield by SSI News Blog, 23 February 2017Fairfield struggles to cope after threefold increase in refugee arrivals by Penny Timms from ABC News, 3 January 2017 The Assyrians in Detroit are primarily Chaldean speakers, who also originate from Iraq. Assyrians in such European countries as Sweden and Germany would usually be Turoyo-speakers or Western Assyrians.B. Furze, P. Savy, R. Brym, J. Lie, Sociology in Today's World, 2008, p. 349  Identity and subdivisions  Assyrian flag (adopted in 1968) Syriac-Aramean flag Chaldean flag (published in 1999) Assyrians of the Middle East and diaspora employ different terms for self-identification based on conflicting beliefs in the origin and identity of their respective communities.Classical Syriac and the Syriac Churches: A Twentieth-Century History, Heleen Murre-van den Berg, p. 127 In certain areas of the Assyrian homeland, identity within a community depends on a person's village of origin (see List of Assyrian settlements) or Christian denomination rather than their ethnic commonality, for instance Chaldean Catholics preferring to be called Chaldeans instead of Assyrians, or a Syriac Orthodox Christian preferring to be called a Syriac. During the 19th century English archaeologist Austen Henry Layard believed that the Syriac Christian communities were descended from the ancient Assyrians, a view that was also shared by William Ainger Wigram. Today, Assyrians and other minority ethnic groups in the Middle East, feel pressure to identify as \\"Arabs\\", \\"Turks\\" and \\"Kurds\\". In addition, Western media often makes no mention of any ethnic identity of the Christian people of the region and simply call them Christians, Iraqi Christians, Iranian Christians, Syrian Christians, and Turkish Christians, a label rejected by Assyrians. = Self-designation = Below are terms commonly used by Assyrians to self-identify:. * Assyrian, named after the ancient Assyrian people, is advocated by followers from within all Middle Eastern based East and West Syrian Rite Churches as a catch all term. (see Syriac Christianity)\\"Eastern Churches\\", Catholic Encyclopedia, see \\"Eastern Syrians\\" and \\"Western Syrians\\" respectively. Modern terminology within the group is Western Assyrians and Eastern Assyrians respectively, while those who reject the Assyrian identity opt for Syriac or Aramean rather than Assyrian. * Chaldean is a term that for centuries indicated the Aramaic language. It was so used by Jerome, and was still the normal terminology in the nineteenth century. Only in 1445 did it begin to be used to mean Aramaic speakers who had entered communion with the Catholic Church. This happened at the Council of Florence, which accepted the profession of faith that Timothy, metropolitan of the Aramaic speakers in Cyprus, made in Aramaic, and which decreed that \\"nobody shall in future dare to call [...] Chaldeans, Nestorians\\".\\"Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence, 1431-49 A.D.Braun-Winkler, p. 112 Previously, when there were as yet no Catholic Aramaic speakers of Mesopotamian origin, the term \\"Chaldean\\" was applied with explicit reference to their \\"Nestorian\\" religion. Thus Jacques de Vitry wrote of them in 1220/1 that \\"they denied that Mary was the Mother of God and claimed that Christ existed in two persons. They consecrated leavened bread and used the 'Chaldean' (Syriac) language\\".Wilhelm Braun, Dietmar W. Winkler, The Church of the East: A Concise History (RoutledgeCurzon 2003), p. 83 Until the second half of the 19th century. the term \\"Chaldean\\" continued in general use for East Syriac Christians, whether \\"Nestorian\\" or Catholic:William F. Ainsworth, Travels and Researches in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Chaldea and Armenia (London 1842), vol. II, p. 272, cited in John Joseph, The Modern Assyrians of the Middle East (BRILL 2000), pp. 2 and 4 it was the West Syriacs who were reported as claiming descent from Asshur, the second son of Shem. * Syriac, named after the Syriac language and as a corruption of \\"Assyrian\\" by the Greek Seleucid Empire, can be found advocated by followers of the Western Rite Syriac Orthodox Church and Syriac Catholic Church. * Aramean, also known as West Assyrian or Syriac-Aramean, named after the ancient Aramean people, is advocated by followers of the Syriac Orthodox Church in Syria and some followers of Syriac Catholic Church in Israel. Furthermore, those identifying as Aramean have obtained recognition from the Israeli government. To note, Arameans are a separate ancient ethnic group that lived concurrently with the Assyrian empire in what is now Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan.Schniedewind, William M. 2002: ‚ÄúThe Rise of the ArameanStates,‚Äù in Mark W. Chavalas and K. Lawson Younger, eds., Mesopotamia and the Bible:Comparative Explora-tions (JSOTSup. 341), London, Sheffield Academic Press, pp. 276-287.Lipi√∑ski, Edward 2000: The Aramaeans Their Ancient His-tory, Culture, Religion (OLA 100), Leuven, Peeters As such, some Assyrians are fervently critical of the Aramean self-identity advocated by those who belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church, stating that, because they originated from Tur-Abdin in southeast Turkey in Upper Mesopotamia, they cannot claim ties to the ancient Aramean land, as it was centred in the Levant.Lipi≈Ñski, E., The Arameans. Their Ancient History, Culture, Religion, (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 100), Leuven, 2000. = Assyrian vs. Syrian naming controversy = Proximity between Roman Syria and Mesopotamia in the 1st century AD (Alain Manesson Mallet, 1683) As early as the 8th century BC Luwian and Cilician subject rulers referred to their Assyrian overlords as Syrian, a western Indo-European corruption of the original term Assyrian. The Greeks used the terms \\"Syrian\\" and \\"Assyrian\\" interchangeably to indicate the indigenous Arameans, Assyrians and other inhabitants of the Near East, Herodotus considered \\"Syria\\" west of the Euphrates. Starting from the 2nd century BC onwards, ancient writers referred to the Seleucid ruler as the King of Syria or King of the Syrians. The Seleucids designated the districts of Seleucis and Coele-Syria explicitly as Syria and ruled the Syrians as indigenous populations residing west of the Euphrates (Aramea) in contrast to Assyrians who had their native homeland in Mesopotamia east of the Euphrates. This version of the name took hold in the Hellenic lands to the west of the old Assyrian Empire, thus during Greek Seleucid rule from 323 BC the name Assyria was altered to Syria, and this term was also applied to Aramea to the west which had been an Assyrian colony, and from this point the Greeks applied the term without distinction between the Assyrians of Mesopotamia and Arameans of the Levant.Herodotus, The Histories, VII.63, s:History of Herodotus/Book 7. When the Seleucids lost control of Assyria to the Parthians they retained the corrupted term (Syria), applying it to ancient Aramea, while the Parthians called Assyria \\"Assuristan,\\" a Parthian form of the original name. It is from this period that the Syrian vs Assyrian controversy arises. Today it is accepted by the majority of scholars that the Medieval, Renaissance and Victorian term Syriac when used to describe the indigenous Christians of Mesopotamia and its immediate surrounds in effect means Assyrian. The question of ethnic identity and self-designation is sometimes connected to the scholarly debate on the etymology of \\"Syria\\". The question has a long history of academic controversy, but majority mainstream opinion currently strongly favours that Syria is indeed ultimately derived from the Assyrian term A≈°≈°≈´rƒÅyu. pp. 281‚Äì285 Meanwhile, some scholars has disclaimed the theory of Syrian being derived from Assyrian as \\"simply naive\\", and detracted its importance to the naming conflict.Festschrift Philologica Constantino Tsereteli Dicta, ed. Silvio Zaorani (Turin, 1993), pp. 106‚Äì107 Rudolf Macuch points out that the Eastern Neo-Aramaic press initially used the term \\"Syrian\\" (sury√™ta) and only much later, with the rise of nationalism, switched to \\"Assyrian\\" (ator√™ta).Rudolf Macuch, Geschichte der sp√§t- und neusyrischen Literatur, New York: de Gruyter, 1976. According to Tsereteli, however, a Georgian equivalent of \\"Assyrians\\" appears in ancient Georgian, Armenian and Russian documents.Tsereteli, Sovremennyj assirijskij jazyk, Moscow: Nauka, 1964. This correlates with the theory of the nations to the East of Mesopotamia knew the group as Assyrians, while to the West, beginning with Greek influence, the group was known as Syrians. Syria being a Greek corruption of Assyria. The debate appears to have been settled by the discovery of the √áinek√∂y inscription in favour of Syria being derived from Assyria. The √áinek√∂y inscription is a Hieroglyphic Luwian-Phoenician bilingual, uncovered from √áinek√∂y, Adana Province, Turkey (ancient Cilicia), dating to the 8th century BC. Originally published by Tekoglu and Lemaire (2000), it was more recently the subject of a 2006 paper published in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, in which the author, Robert Rollinger, lends support to the age-old debate of the name \\"Syria\\" being derived from \\"Assyria\\" (see Etymology of Syria). The object on which the inscription is found is a monument belonging to Urikki, vassal king of Hiyawa (i.e., Cilicia), dating to the eighth century BC. In this monumental inscription, Urikki made reference to the relationship between his kingdom and his Assyrian overlords. The Luwian inscription reads \\"Sura/i\\" whereas the Phoenician translation reads ‚Äô≈†R or \\"Ashur\\" which, according to Rollinger (2006), \\"settles the problem once and for all\\". The modern terminological problem goes back to colonial times, but it became more acute in 1946, when with the independence of Syria, the adjective Syrian referred to an independent state. The controversy isn't restricted to exonyms like English \\"Assyrian\\" vs. \\"Aramaean\\", but also applies to self-designation in Neo-Aramaic, the minority \\"Aramaean\\" faction endorses both S≈´ryƒÅyƒì and ƒÄrƒÅmayƒì , while the majority \\"Assyrian\\" faction insists on ƒÄ·πØ≈´rƒÅyƒì but also accepts S≈´ryƒÅyƒì.  Culture  Assyrian child dressed in traditional clothes The Assyrian dialects Assyrian culture is largely influenced by Christianity. There are many Assyrian customs that are common in other Middle Eastern cultures. Main festivals occur during religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas. There are also secular holidays such as Kha b-Nisan (vernal equinox). People often greet and bid relatives farewell with a kiss on each cheek and by saying \\"\\" Shlama/Shlomo lokh, which means: \\"Peace be upon you\\" in Neo-Aramaic. Others are greeted with a handshake with the right hand only; according to Middle Eastern customs, the left hand is associated with evil. Similarly, shoes may not be left facing up, one may not have their feet facing anyone directly, whistling at night is thought to waken evil spirits, etc.Chamberlain, AF. \\"Notes on Some Aspects of the Folk-Psychology of Night\\". American Journal of Psychology, 1908 ‚Äì JSTOR. A parent will often place an eye pendant on their baby to prevent \\"an evil eye being cast upon it\\".Gansell, AR.

Spitting on anyone or their belongings is seen as a grave insult. Assyrians are endogamous, meaning they generally marry within their own ethnic group, although exogamous marriages are not perceived as a taboo, unless the foreigner is of a different religious background, especially a Muslim. Throughout history, relations between the Assyrians and Armenians have tended to be very friendly, as both groups have practised Christianity since ancient times and have suffered through persecution under Muslim rulers. Therefore, mixed marriage between Assyrians and Armenians is quite common, most notably in Iraq, Iran, and as well as in the diaspora with adjacent Armenian and Assyrian communities.The Ethnic Minorities of Armenia, Garnik Asatryan, Victoria Arakelova. = Language = The Neo-Aramaic languages, which are in the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family, ultimately descend from Late Old Eastern Aramaic, the lingua franca in the later phase of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which displaced the East Semitic Assyrian dialect of Akkadian and Sumerian. Aramaic was the language of commerce, trade and communication and became the vernacular language of Assyria in classical antiquity.Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B. C. by G. R. Driver By the 1st century AD, Akkadian was extinct, although its influence on contemporary Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages spoken by Assyrians is significant and some loaned vocabulary still survives in these languages to this day.Kaufman, Stephen A. (1974), The Akkadian influences on Aramaic. University of Chicago Press To the native speaker, \\"Syriac\\" is usually called Surayt, Soureth, Suret or a similar regional variant. A wide variety of languages and dialects exist, including Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo- Aramaic, and Turoyo. Minority dialects include Senaya and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, which are both near extinction. All are classified as Neo-Aramaic languages and are written using Syriac script, a derivative of the ancient Aramaic script. Jewish varieties such as Lishanid Noshan, Lish√°n Did√°n and Lishana Deni, written in the Hebrew script, are spoken by Assyrian Jews.Avenery, Iddo, The Aramaic Dialect of the Jews of Zakho. The Israel academy of Science and Humanities 1988.Khan, Geoffrey (1999). A Grammar of Neo-Aramaic: the dialect of the Jews of Arbel. Leiden: EJ Brill.Maclean, Arthur John (1895). Grammar of the dialects of vernacular Syriac: as spoken by the Eastern Syrians of Kurdistan, north-west Persia, and the Plain of Mosul: with notices of the vernacular of the Jews of Azerbaijan and of Zakhu near Mosul. Cambridge University Press, London. There is a considerable amount of mutual intelligibility between Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Senaya, Lishana Deni and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic. Therefore, these \\"languages\\" would generally be considered to be dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic rather than separate languages. The Jewish Aramaic languages of Lishan Didan and Lishanid Noshan share a partial intelligibility with these varieties. The mutual intelligibility between the aforementioned languages and Turoyo is, depending on the dialect, limited to partial, and may be asymmetrical.Heinrichs, Wolfhart (ed.) (1990). Studies in Neo-Aramaic. Scholars Press: Atlanta, Georgia. .Tezel, Aziz (2003). Comparative Etymological Studies in the Western Neo-Syriac (·π¨≈´r≈çyo) Lexicon: with special reference to homonyms, related words and borrowings with cultural signification. Uppsala Universitet. . Being stateless, Assyrians are typically multilingual, speaking both their native language and learning those of the societies they reside in. While many Assyrians have fled from their traditional homeland recently, a substantial number still reside in Arabic-speaking countries speaking Arabic alongside the Neo-Aramaic languages and is also spoken by many Assyrians in the diaspora. The most commonly spoken languages by Assyrians in the diaspora are English, German and Swedish. Historically many Assyrians also spoke Turkish, Armenian, Azeri, Kurdish, and Persian and a smaller number of Assyrians that remain in Iran, Turkey (Istanbul and Tur Abdin) and Armenia still do today. Many loanwords from the aforementioned languages also exist in the Neo-Aramaic languages, with the Iranian languages and Turkish being the greatest influences overall. Only Turkey is reported to be experiencing a population increase of Assyrians in the four countries constituting their historical homeland, largely consisting of Assyrian refugees from Syria and a smaller number of Assyrians returning from the diaspora in Europe. Script Assyrians predominantly use the Syriac script, which is written from right to left. It is one of the Semitic abjads directly descending from the Aramaic alphabet and shares similarities with the Phoenician, Hebrew and the Arabic alphabets.Pennacchietti, Fabrizio A. (1997). \\"On the etymology of the Neo- Aramaic particle qam/kim; in Hebrew\\", M. Bar-Aher (ed.): Gideon Goldenberg Festschrift, Massorot, Stud It has 22 letters representing consonants, three of which can be also used to indicate vowels. The vowel sounds are supplied either by the reader's memory or by optional diacritic marks. Syriac is a cursive script where some, but not all, letters connect within a word. It was used to write the Syriac language from the 1st century AD. The oldest and classical form of the alphabet is the ' script.Hatch, William (1946). An album of dated Syriac manuscripts. Boston: The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, reprinted in 2002 by Gorgias Press. p. 24. . Although  æEs·π≠rangƒìlƒÅ is no longer used as the main script for writing Syriac, it has received some revival since the 10th century, and it has been added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999. The East Syriac dialect is usually written in the ' form of the alphabet, which is often translated as \\"contemporary\\", reflecting its use in writing modern Neo-Aramaic. The West Syriac dialect is usually written in the ' form of the alphabet. Most of the letters are clearly derived from  æEs·π≠rangƒìlƒÅ, but are simplified, flowing lines.Nestle, Eberhard (1888). Syrische Grammatik mit Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar. Berlin: H. Reuther's Verlagsbuchhandlung. [translated to English as Syriac grammar with bibliography, chrestomathy and glossary, by R. S. Kennedy. London: Williams & Norgate 1889. p. 5]. Furthermore, for practical reasons, Assyrian people would also use the Latin alphabet, especially in social media. = Religion = Historical divisions within Syriac Christian Churches in the Middle East Assyrians belong to various Christian denominations such as the Assyrian Church of the East, with an estimated 400,000 members, the Chaldean Catholic Church, with about 600,000 members,J. Martin Bailey, Betty Jane Bailey, Who Are the Christians in the Middle East? p. 163: \\"more than two thirds\\" out of \\"nearly a million\\" Christians in Iraq. and the Syriac Orthodox Church ( øIdto Suryoyto Tri·π£a·πØ ≈†u·∏á·∏•o), which has between 1 million and 4 million members around the world (only some of whom are Assyrians), the Ancient Church of the East with some 100,000 members. A small minority of Assyrians accepted the Protestant Reformation thus are Reform Orthodox in the 20th century, possibly due to British influences, and is now organized in the Assyrian Evangelical Church, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church and other Protestant/Reform Orthodox Assyrian groups. While Assyrians are predominantly Christian, an echoing minority, particularly those raised in the west, tend to be irreligious or atheistic in nature. Many members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman Millet system. The group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into: * adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East following the East Syrian Rite also known as Nestorians * adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church following the East Syrian Rite also known as Chaldeans * adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church following the West Syrian Rite also known as Jacobites * adherents of the Syriac Catholic Church following the West Syrian Rite Baptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a Brit Milah or Bar Mitzvah in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of Jesus; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning. During the \\"Seyfo\\" genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who converted to Islam. They reside in Turkey, and practice Islam but still retain their identity. A small number of Assyrian Jews exist as well. = Music = Traditional clothing may be worn for Assyrian folk dance. Assyrian music is a combination of traditional folk music and western contemporary music genres, namely pop and soft rock, but also electronic dance music. Instruments traditionally used by Assyrians include the zurna and davula, but has expanded to include guitars, pianos, violins, synthesizers (keyboards and electronic drums), and other instruments. Some well known Assyrian singers in modern times are Ashur Bet Sargis, Sargon Gabriel, Evin Agassi, Janan Sawa, Juliana Jendo, and Linda George. Assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include Melechesh, Timz and Aril Brikha. Assyrian-Australian band Azadoota performs its songs in the Assyrian language whilst using a western style of instrumentation. The first international Aramaic Music Festival was held in Lebanon in August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally. = Dance = Assyrians have numerous traditional dances which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of both ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of circle dances that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both. The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is khigga, which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the Sabre Dance, which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and tempo of a song. Folk dance in an Assyrian party in Chicago = Festivals = Assyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which Easter is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the Gregorian calendar and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.The Date of Easter. Article from United States Naval Observatory (March 27, 2007). However, members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar (March 22 and April 25 on the Julian calendar). During Lent, Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based. Assyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones: * Kha b-Nisan ', the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation. * Sauma d-Ba'utha ', the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer. * Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes * Kalu d'Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane * Nusardyl, commemorating the baptism of the Assyrians of Urmia by St. Thomas. * Sharra d'Mart Maryam, usually on August 15, a festival and feast celebrating St. Mary with games, food, and celebration. * Other Sharras (special festivals) include: Sharra d'Mart Shmuni, Sharra d'Mar Shimon Bar-Sabbaye, Sharra d'Mar Mari, and Shara d'Mar Zaia, Mar Bishu, Mar Sawa, Mar Sliwa, and Mar Odisho * Yoma d'Sah'deh (Day of Martyrs), commemorating the thousands massacred in the Simele Massacre and the hundreds of thousands massacred in the Assyrian Genocide. It is commemorated annually on August 7. Assyrians also practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2‚Äì3 days; in the Assyrian diaspora they last 1‚Äì2 days. = Traditional clothing = Assyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace. =Cuisine= Assyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes. Typically, rice is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. Tea is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. Alcoholic drinks such as wine and wheat beer are organically produced and drunk.  Genetics  Late-20th-century DNA analysis conducted by Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, \\"shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population.\\" Genetic analyses of the Assyrians of Persia demonstrated that they were \\"closed\\" with little \\"intermixture\\" with the Muslim Persian population and that an individual Assyrian's genetic makeup is relatively close to that of the Assyrian population as a whole. \\"The genetic data are compatible with historical data that religion played a major role in maintaining the Assyrian population's separate identity during the Christian era\\". In a 2006 study of the Y chromosome DNA of six regional Armenian populations, including, for comparison, Assyrians and Syrians, researchers found that, \\"the Semitic populations (Assyrians and Syrians) are very distinct from each other according to both [comparative] axes. This difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies.\\"Yepiskoposian et al., Iran and the Caucasus, Volume 10, Number 2, 2006, pp. 191-208(18), \\"Genetic Testing of Language Replacement Hypothesis in Southwest Asia\\" A 2008 study on the genetics of \\"old ethnic groups in Mesopotamia\\", including 340 subjects from seven ethnic communities (\\"Assyrian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, Armenian, Turkmen, the Arab peoples in Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait\\") found that Assyrians were homogeneous with respect to all other ethnic groups sampled in the study, regardless of religious affiliation. In a 2011 study focusing on the genetics of Marsh Arabs of Iraq, researchers identified Y chromosome haplotypes shared by Marsh Arabs, Iraqis, and Assyrians, \\"supporting a common local background.\\"Al-Zahery et al., BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:288, \\"In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq\\"\\"In the less frequent J1-M267* clade, only marginally affected by events of expansion, Marsh Arabs shared haplotypes with other Iraqi and Assyrian samples, supporting a common local background.\\" In a 2017 study focusing on the genetics of Northern Iraqi populations, it was found that Iraqi Assyrians and Iraqi Yazidis clustered together, but away from the other Northern Iraqi populations analyzed in the study, and largely in between the West Asian and Southeastern European populations. According to the study, \\"contemporary Assyrians and Yazidis from Northern Iraq may in fact have a stronger continuity with the original genetic stock of the Mesopotamian people, which possibly provided the basis for the ethnogenesis of various subsequent Near Eastern populations\\". =Haplogroups= Y-DNA haplogroup J-M304 has been measured at 55% among Assyrians of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and diaspora; while it has been found at 11% among Assyrians of Iran. Haplogroup T-M184 [reported as K*] has been measured at 15.09% among Assyrians in Armenia. The haplogroup is frequent in Middle Eastern Jews, Georgians, Druze and Somalians. According to a 2011 study by Lashgary et al., R1b [reported as R*(xR1a)] has been measured at 40% among Assyrians in Iran, making it major haplogroup among Iranian Assyrians. Yet another DNA test comprising 48 Assyrian male subjects from Iran, the Y-DNA haplogroups J-M304, found in its greatest concentration in the Arabian peninsula, and the northern R-M269, were also frequent at 29.2% each. Lashgary et al. explain the presence of haplogroup R in Iranian Assyrians as well as in other Assyrian communities (~23%) as a consequence of mixing with Armenians and assimilation/integration of different peoples carrying haplogroup R, while explain its frequency as a result of genetic drift due to small population size and endogamy due to religious barriers. Haplogroup J2 has been measured at 13.4%, which is commonly found in the Fertile Crescent, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Italy, coastal Mediterranean, and the Iranian plateau.Semino O, Magri C, Benuzzi G, Lin AA, Al-Zahery N, Battaglia V, Maccioni L, Triantaphyllidis C, Shen P, Oefner PJ, Zhivotovsky LA, King R, Torroni A, Cavalli-Sforza LL, Underhill PA, Santachiara- Benerecetti AS: Origin, diffusion, and differentiation of Y-chromosome haplogroups E and J: inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and later migratory events in the Mediterranean area.

The descriptions of the characters are accompanied by information on details about appearances and references to the characters. Major characters (Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Marvin the Paranoid Android, Trillian, and Slartibartfast) are listed but described in their own articles.  Main characters  = Arthur Dent = Along with Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent barely escapes the Earth's destruction as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle. He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy. In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker. = Ford Prefect = Ford Prefect is Arthur Dent's friend ‚Äì and rescuer, when the Earth is unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass at the start of the story. Although his heart is in the right place and he is shown to be highly intelligent, resourceful and even brave, Ford is essentially a dilettante when it comes to causes such as the search for the question to the ultimate answer of \\"life, the universe and everything\\". Ford takes a more existential view on the universe, sometimes bordering on joyful nihilism. He is eccentric and endlessly broad-minded ‚Äì no doubt due to his vast experience of roughing it around the galaxy ‚Äì and possesses of an off-key and often very dark sense of humour. = Zaphod Beeblebrox = Zaphod Beeblebrox is a \\"semi-half-cousin\\" of Ford Prefect. He is hedonistic and irresponsible, narcissistic, and often extremely insensitive to the feelings of those around him. Zaphod invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Zaphod wears unique clothing that contains a mixture of bright and contrasting colours to make him stand out and be the centre of attention wherever he goes. He was voted \\"Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe\\" seven consecutive times. He's been described as \\"the best Bang since the Big One\\" by Eccentrica Gallumbits, and as \\"one hoopy frood\\" by others. He was briefly the President of the Galaxy and is the only man to have survived the Total Perspective Vortex. = Marvin the Paranoid Android = Marvin the Paranoid Android is the ship's robot aboard the starship Heart of Gold. Originally built as one of many failed prototypes of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation's GPP (Genuine People Personalities) technology, Marvin is afflicted with severe depression and boredom, in part because he has a \\"brain the size of a planet\\" which he is seldom, if ever, given the chance to use. Indeed, the true horror of Marvin's existence is that no task he could be given would occupy even the tiniest fraction of his vast intellect. Marvin claims he is 50,000 times more intelligent than a human. = Trillian = Trillian is a mathematician and astrophysicist whom Arthur Dent attempted to talk to at a party in Islington. She and Arthur next meet six months later on the spaceship Heart of Gold, shortly after the Earth has been destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass. = Slartibartfast = Slartibartfast is a Magrathean, and a designer of planets. His favourite part of the job is creating coastlines, the most notable of which are the fjords found on the coast of Norway on planet Earth, for which he won an award. When Earth Mk. II is being made, Slartibartfast is assigned to the continent of Africa. He is unhappy about this because he has begun \\"doing it with fjords again\\" (arguing that they give a continent a lovely baroque feel), but has been told by his superiors that they are \\"not equatorial enough\\". In relation to this, he expresses the view that he would \\"far rather be happy than right any day.\\"  Minor characters  = Agrajag = Agrajag is a piteous creature that is continually reincarnated and subsequently killed, each time unknowingly, by Arthur Dent. Agrajag is first identified in , but it is revealed that several of Arthur's encounters in the first and second novels (and in previous chapters of the third) were with previous incarnations of Agrajag. The first occurs in , when a bowl of petunias is suddenly yanked into existence miles above the planet Magrathea, and begins falling, having only time to think \\"Oh, no, not again\\" before crashing to the ground. The reason behind the bowl's lament is revealed in , when Agrajag identifies the bowl of petunias as one of his prior incarnations, and tells Arthur that he had seen his face in a spaceship window as he fell to his doom. In another incarnation, Agrajag was a rabbit on prehistoric Earth (during the time period recounted in ) who was killed by Arthur for breakfast and whose skin was fashioned into a pouch, which is then used to swat a fly who also happened to be Agrajag. In yet another, near the beginning of , Agrajag is an old man who dies of a heart attack after seeing Arthur and Ford materialise, seated on a Chesterfield sofa, in the midst of a match at Lord's Cricket Ground. Eventually, Agrajag wishes to take revenge on Arthur Dent, diverting his teleportation to a Cathedral of Hate. However, in the process of explaining his reasons for hating Arthur he mentions \\"Stavromula Beta\\", where Arthur had ducked to avoid a shot fired by an assassin, which then had killed Agrajag instead. Arthur, having never been to Stavromula Beta, has no idea what Agrajag is talking about, and Agrajag realises that he's brought Arthur to the cathedral too early. He tries to kill Arthur anyway, and once again dies at Arthur's hands while Arthur is defending himself, but not before setting off the explosives intended to kill Arthur by triggering a massive rockfall. Arthur escapes the rockfall unharmed. For the next few years Arthur travels the universe, secure in his knowledge that, no matter what happens, he cannot die at least until after he survives his assassination attempt at Stavromula Beta. In Arthur's daughter Random Frequent Flyer Dent holds him hostage in a London club. When she fires her weapon Arthur dodges, causing the bolt to pass over his head and hit the man standing behind him. Earlier the victim (Agrajag) had dropped a book of matches which revealed the owner of the nightclub to be Stavro Mueller, and the name of the club to be Beta. Thus, what Arthur believed to be the name of a planet was actually the name of the nightclub, and Agrajag has died once again. Because of this, Arthur is now able to die as well, which, thanks to the Vogons, he supposedly does a few seconds later. In , Douglas Adams plays Agrajag, having recorded the part for an audiobook version of . Producer Dirk Maggs added a suitable voice treatment, and Simon Jones as Arthur Dent recorded his lines opposite the pre-recorded Adams. Adams was thus able to \\"reincarnate\\" to participate in the new series. At the end of , Arthur Dent's extreme bad luck in life coupled with cosmic balance mean that as he materialises on a planet shortly before Vogons are due to destroy it, Agrajag wakes up from a coma after six months having won the lottery and been recognised by a long lost love whilst on \\"Celebrity Coma\\". This event presumably leads to cosmic balance ruining his other lives for the benefit of Arthur Dent. In the 2017 second season of the television adaptation of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency a dog is named Agrajag with expected consequences. = Mrs Alice Beeblebrox = Alice Beeblebrox is Zaphod's favourite mother, lives at 108 Astral Crescent, Zoovroozlechester, Betelgeuse V, and guards the true story of Zaphod's visit to the Frogstar, waiting for \\"the right price.\\" She is referenced in . = The Allitnils = As their names were written to suggest, every Allitnil is an anti-clone of a Lintilla. They were created by the cloning company to eliminate the billions of cloned Lintillas flooding out of a malfunctioning cloning machine. Being anti-clones, when an Allitnil comes into physical contact with a Lintilla, they both wink out of existence in a puff of unsmoke. Along with Poodoo and Varntvar the Priest, three Allitnils arrived on Brontitall to get the three Lintillas there to \\"agree to cease to be\\". Two of the clones eliminate their corresponding Lintillas, but Arthur shoots the third Allitnil, so that one Lintilla survives. Appearing only in , every one of the Allitnils is voiced by David Tate. The Allitnils, like the Lintillas, do not appear in the novels nor in the BBC television series. = Almighty Bob = The Almighty Bob is a deity worshipped by the people of Lamuella. Old Thrashbarg is one of the priests who worships Almighty Bob; however, Thrashbarg is often ignored by the villagers of Lamuella. The Almighty Bob appears in the fifth book, . = Anjie = Anjie was a woman, on the brink of retirement, on whose behalf a raffle was being held in order to buy her a kidney machine. An unnamed woman (played by June Whitfield on the radio) convinces Arthur Dent to buy raffle tickets while he and Fenchurch are in a railway pub, attempting to have lunch. Arthur won an album of bagpipe music. Referred to in: = Arcturan Megafreighter crew = The captain and first officer were the only crew of an Arcturan Megafreighter carrying a larger number of copies of Playbeing magazine than the mind can comfortably conceive. They brought Zaphod Beeblebrox to Ursa Minor Beta, after he had escaped from the Haggunenon flagship. Zaphod was let on board by the Number One, who was cynical about the Guide's editors becoming soft. He admired the fact that Zaphod was \\"hitching the hard way\\". They only appear in , where the captain is played by David Tate, and his number one by Bill Paterson. However, some of their dialogue was given to other characters in . = Aseed = Leader of the cheese-worshipping Tyromancers on the planet Nano. Appears in . = Barmen = Three different barmen appear during the series.  Barman of the Horse and Groom  In , in , and the film, Ford and Arthur quickly down three pints each ‚Äì at lunchtime ‚Äì to calm their muscles before using the teleport to escape on the Vogon ship. Being told the world is about to end he calls \\"last orders, please.\\" The Red Lion Inn at Chelwood Gate, East Sussex, was used during the TV series, and referenced in the dialogue (Adams himself can be seen in the background of this scene); Steve Conway played the character on TV. This barman was played by David Gooderson in the original radio series and Stephen Moore in the LP recording. In the 2005 motion picture, Albie Woodington portrayed the barman.  Barman in Old Pink Dog Bar  Ford visits the Old Pink Dog Bar in Han Dold City, orders a round for everyone and then tries to use an American Express card to pay for it, fails, is threatened by a disembodied hand and so offers a Guide write-up instead. This happens in . In the radio adaptation of this novel, the barman was played by Arthur Smith.  Barman in the Domain of the King  Another barman takes a galactic sized tip for Elvis from Ford on his Hitchhiker's corporate Dine-O-Charge credit card in an attempt to bankrupt InfiniDim Enterprises in and the final radio series. This bartender was played by Roger Gregg. = BBC department head = When Arthur returns to Earth in he calls his department head to explain why he was absent from work the last six months: \\"I've gone mad.\\" His superior is very relaxed about it and asks when Arthur will return to work, and is quite satisfied by the reply \\"When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?\\" In the fourth radio series the part was played by Geoffrey Perkins, who had produced the first two radio series and who had been the BBC TV head of comedy from 1995 to 2001. = Blart Versenwald III = In the epilogue of , Blart Versenwald III was a top genetic engineer, and a man who could never keep his mind on the job at hand. When his homeworld was under threat from an invading army, he was tasked with creating an army of super- soldiers to fight them. Instead, he created (among other things) a remarkable new breed of superfly that could distinguish between solid glass and an open window, and also an off-switch for children. Fortunately, because the invaders were only invading because they couldn't cope with things back home, they too were impressed with Blart's creations, and a flurry of economic treaties rapidly secured peace. = Bodyguard = The strong silent type, an unnamed bodyguard is seen guarding the late Hotblack Desiato in . His face, according to the book \\"had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.\\" In he is portrayed by actor David Prowse, Star Wars Darth Vader, as a man of few words who can lift Ford Prefect clean off the floor. In the LP adaptation of the radio series, the character was voiced by David Tate. = Caveman = Arthur attempts to play Scrabble with a caveman, who is not even able to spell \\"Grunt\\" and \\"Agh\\", and \\"he's probably spelt library with one R again\\". However, he does spell \\"forty- two\\", giving Arthur the idea to pull out letters from the letters bag at random to attempt to find the ultimate question; this results in the unhelpful \\"What do you get when you multiply six by nine?\\" which does not match the answer. Appears in played by David Jason, , and . = Colin = Colin (a.k.a. part #223219B) is a small, round, melon-sized, flying security robot which Ford Prefect enslaves to aid in his escape from the newly re-organized Guide offices in . \\"Its motion sensors are the usual Sirius Cybernetics garbage.\\" Ford captures Colin by trapping the robot with his towel and re-wiring the robot's pleasure circuits, inducing a cyber-ecstasy trip. Ford uses Colin's cheerfulness to break into the Guide's corporate accounting software in order to plant a Trojan Horse module that will automatically pay anything billed to his InfiniDim Enterprises credit card. Colin also saves Ford's life when the Guide's new security force, the Vogons, fire at him with a rocket launcher after Ford feels the need to jump out of the window. Colin was last seen being sent (at the risk of possible lonely incineration) to look after the delivery of the Guide Mark II to Arthur Dent in the Vogon postal system. Colin was named after a dog which belonged to a girl, Emily Saunders, of whom Ford had fond memories. Colin appears in , and in the radio series he was played by Andrew Secombe. = Constant Mown = Crew member on the Vogon ship commanded by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, and Jeltz's son. Notable for his very un-Vogon-like emotions, ethics and agility, all of which he attempts to keep hidden (with varying degrees of success) from his father and crewmates, lest he be demoted to more unpleasant (even for a Vogon) duties or killed outright for aberrant behavior. Appears in . = Dr. Dan Streetmentioner = Author of Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations which is handy for those travelling through time, and especially to Milliways. His guide is more complete than The Guide itself, which ignores the time travel tense topic ‚Äì other than pointing out that the term 'future perfect' has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. He is also mentioned in the third radio series, which gives many examples of his tense forms. = Deep Thought = Deep Thought is a computer that was created by a pan-dimensional, hyper- intelligent species of beings (whose three-dimensional protrusions into our universe are ordinary white mice) to come up with the Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Deep Thought is the size of a small city. When, after seven and a half million years of calculation, the answer finally turns out to be 42, Deep Thought admonishes Loonquawl and Phouchg (the receivers of the Ultimate Answer) that \\"[she] checked it very thoroughly, and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you is that you've never actually known what the question was.\\" Deep Thought does not know the ultimate question to Life, the Universe and Everything, but offers to design an even more powerful computer, Earth, to calculate it. After ten million years of calculation, the Earth is destroyed by Vogons five minutes before the computation is complete. Appears in: * On radio, Deep Thought was voiced by Geoffrey McGivern. On television and in the LP re-recording of the radio series, it was voiced by Valentine Dyall. In the feature film Deep Thought's voice was provided by actress Helen Mirren. In the television series, Deep Thought was shaped like a massive black metal trapezoid with a yellow rectangular display that blinked on and off in time with the computer's speaking. The timing of the light's flashing was done on set by author Douglas Adams. Valentine Dyall's voice was dubbed in later. In the feature film, it appears as a large, vaguely humanoid computer, with a gigantic head supported, as if in bored repose, by two arms and has a female voice (provided by actress Helen Mirren). This particular version of Deep Thought likes to watch television and late in the film can also be seen to have the Apple Computer logo above its eye. This is a reference to Adams being a fan and advocate of the Apple Macintosh. It is also revealed that, in the intervening time, Deep Thought was commissioned by the Consortium of Angry Housewives to create the Point of View Gun. IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Thought was named in honour of this fictional computer. Deep Thought can be seen inscribed on a computer in the NORAD VI area of the 1992 computer game The Journeyman Project. Regarding the name, Douglas Adams was quoted as saying \\"The name is a very obvious joke\\" (it is a reference to the film Deep Throat). = Dionah Carlinton Housney = Dionah appears in And Another Thing... by Eoin Colfer. Dionah is one of Zaphod Beeblebrox's favorite singer/prostitutes. She appears out of nowhere in the 'Heart of Gold' starship and sings Zaphod a cryptic song about the entrance to the planet Asgard. Zaphod does not understand the song. She vanishes after saying \\"oh for Zark's sake\\" and then turns into an ice sculpture of herself. The sculpture soon melts into water, the water droplets rise up into the ceiling and every drop disappears after making a 'oh' sound. Zaphod later comments \\"That girl always could sing\\". = Disaster Area's chief research accountant = As Disaster Area's earnings require hypermathematics, their chief research accountant was named Professor of Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon and in his Special Theories of Tax Returns he proves that space-time is \\"not merely curved, it is, in fact, totally bent.\\" The Guide shows a graphic indicating that most of the earnings ends up with the accountant. Referred to in: * * = Dish of the Day = The quadruped Dish of the Day is an Ameglian Major Cow, a ruminant specifically bred to not only have the desire to be eaten, but to be capable of saying so quite clearly and distinctly. When asked if he would like to see the Dish of the Day, Zaphod replies, \\"We'll meet the meat.\\" The Major Cow's quite vocal and emphatic desire to be consumed by Milliways' patrons is the most revolting thing that Arthur Dent has ever heard, and the Dish is nonplussed by a queasy Arthur's subsequent order of a green salad, since it knows \\"many vegetables that are very clear\\" on the point of not wanting to be eaten ‚Äì which was part of the reason for the creation of the Ameglian Major Cow in the first place. After Zaphod orders four rare steaks, the Dish announces that it is nipping off to the kitchen to shoot itself. Though it states, \\"I'll be very humane,\\" this does not comfort Arthur at all. Several years later, the principal characters encounter a herd of Ameglian Major Cows on the planet Nano, a colony planet established for exceedingly rich refugees from the destroyed Earth. Ford and Arthur (who is now far more open-minded after years spent traversing the galaxy) seriously consider the Cows' offering themselves as a meal, only to be interrupted by the arrival of the Norse thunder god Thor and his subsequent duel with Bowerick Wowbagger. However, the lightning display accompanying Thor's arrival kills and chars several Major Cows (while their still-living herdmates curse their fellows' luck), and Ford and Arthur take the opportunity to sample the cooked meat. Later, a Major Cow is shown offering itself to Thor at the thunder god's victory party. Appears in:  The character is not present in the original radio series, but does make a cameo appearance in the finale of the fifth radio series. The first appearance of it was in a stage adaptation in 1980 at the Rainbow Theatre. Since then it appeared in , and . In the TV series, it was played by Peter Davison, who was at that time both Sandra Dickinson's husband and the newly announced fifth Doctor. Dickinson played Trillian in the television series (and \\"Tricia McMillan\\" in the final radio series), and suggested casting Davison, who was a fan of the radio series. = East River Creature = As Ford Prefect travels through space in a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation spaceship, he has a dream in which he encounters a strange creature made of slime from the East River in New York who has just come into existence. After asking Ford a series of questions about life, and Ford's recommendation of finding love on 7th Avenue, the creature leaves Ford to talk to a nearby policeman on his status in life. Appearances: * * In , the East River character was played by American comedian Jackie Mason. = Eccentrica Gallumbits = Known as \\"The Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon Six\\", Eccentrica Gallumbits, the author of The Big Bang Theory ‚Äì A Personal View, is mentioned in all six of the novels. She is first mentioned in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when Arthur looks up Earth for the first time in the guide. The entry for Earth follows that for Eccentrica Gallumbits. She is heard about again during a newscast that Zaphod Beeblebrox tunes into shortly after stealing the spaceship Heart of Gold. The newsreader quotes Eccentrica describing Zaphod as \\"The best bang since the Big One.\\" It was also reported in that Zaphod had delivered a presidential address from her bedroom on at least one occasion. Commentary on Zaphod in intimates that one reason for his acquiring a third arm is the ability to fondle all of Eccentrica's breasts at the same time. Pears Gallumbit, a dessert which has several things in common with her, is available at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body; Ford Prefect disagrees, saying five. She is referenced in an issue of the Legion of Super Heroes.Legionnaires No. 0 She is again mentioned in after a wheel of cheese appears above the Nanites. \\"This sudden and most unexpected apparition shifted the crowd's focus faster than the appearance of Eccentrica Gallumbits wearing a neon T-shirt flashing the slogan Freebie Friday would shift the focus of the crowd at a VirginNerd convention on a Friday.\\" = Eddie = Eddie is the name of the shipboard computer on the starship Heart of Gold. Like every other system on the spaceship, it has a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Genuine People Personality. Thus, Eddie is over-excitable, quite talkative, over-enthused and extremely ingratiating, or alternatively a coddling, school matron-type as a back-up personality. Shipboard networking interconnects Eddie with everything on the Heart of Gold; at one point, the whole ship is effectively crippled by Arthur Dent's request for tea from the Nutrimatic drinks dispenser; the computation of which nearly crashed Eddie and everything connected to him. On one occasion when certain destruction seems quite imminent, Eddie sings \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" in a particularly cheesy and upbeat tone. Appears in:  * He is voiced in the first two radio series and on television by David Tate. In the television version, Eddie has lights on his case that flash when he speaks. Douglas Adams read in Eddie's lines during filming to operate the lights. In the 2004‚Äì2005 radio series, he is voiced by Roger Gregg and in the 2005 feature film by Thomas Lennon. = Effrafax of Wug = A sciento-magician who bet his life that he could make an entire mountain invisible within a year. Having wasted most of the period of time failing to create a cloaking device, he hired a company to simply remove the mountain, though this course of action lost him the bet, and his life. This was all due in part to the sudden and rather suspicious presence of an extra moon, and in addition, the fact that you could never touch anything when you walked near the supposed invisible mountain. It is remarked that he should have established a simple Somebody Else's Problem field, which would make the mountain totally invisible even if it were to be painted bright pink. Referenced in: . = Elders of Krikkit = The Elders of Krikkit were, in , under influence of the remains of the supercomputer Hactar, which √¶ons previously had been blown to dust, but retained a measure of consciousness, and determined to destroy the entire universe using the supernova bomb they had built. Trillian used her feminine charm and smart rhetoric in an attempt to dissuade the elders, but failed to stop them deploying the ultimate weapon, which simply dented the council chamber very badly. = Elvis Presley = Elvis Presley is a real-life singer, who died in 1977. It has been popularly suggested that he has been abducted by aliens, or that he is actually an alien who faked his own death so he could return to his home planet. In , Elvis is discovered by Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent working as a bar singer on an alien planet, and owning a large pink spaceship. Ford, having become a huge fan of Elvis while he was stranded on Earth, watched the performance intently for its entire duration. Presley is not actually named, however his identity is easy to determine from the facts that the bar is called \\"The Domain of The King,\\" the \\"EP\\" initials in the pink spaceship which Ford and Arthur buy from him, and the accent in which he sings. He tells Ford that, contrary to popular belief, he was not abducted by aliens; he went with them of his own free will. Ford's irreplaceable blue suede shoes, one of which is destroyed during the events in the early part of , are a tribute to his Elvis fandom. In the radio adaptation of , , it has been indicated that in the alternate Earth which is the focus of the story, Elvis never died, and there is mention of an album \\"Elvis sings Oasis\\". He appears (but is not directly named) in , voiced by Philip Pope. = Emperor of the Galaxy = Many millennia prior to the events of the series, the final Emperor of the Galactic Empire (in the Hitchhiker's universe) was placed into a stasis field during his dying moments: thus leaving the Empire with a technically ruling, but actually near-dead Emperor, with all his heirs long since dead. And so today, an Imperial President, elected by the Galactic Assembly, has all the trappings of power, without actually wielding any. This was the office held by Yooden Vranx and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Mentioned in: * * = Mrs Enid Kapelsen = An old woman from Boston who rediscovers purpose in life by seeing Arthur and Fenchurch flying (and performing \\"other activities\\") outside the aeroplane within which she is flying to Heathrow. Witnessing this, she became enlightened, and realized that everything she had ever been taught was varyingly incorrect. She annoys the flight attendants by continually pressing her call button for reasons such as \\"the child in front was making milk come out of his nose.\\" Later she ends up seated next to Arthur and Fenchurch on another aeroplane en route from Los Angeles to London (though in the original radio series, she flies with Arthur and Fenchurch on a flight from London to Los Angeles). Appears in: * She was played by Margaret Robertson in during the Quandary Phase. = Eric Bartlett = In , it is gardener Eric Bartlett who discovers that space-aliens have landed on Tricia's lawn and haven't cut her grass. = Fenchurch = Fenchurch is Arthur Dent's soulmate in the fourth book of the Hitchhiker \\"trilogy\\", . Fenchurch was named after the Fenchurch Street railway station where she was conceived in the ticket queue. Adams revealed in an interview that it was really the ticket queues at Paddington Station that made him think of conceiving a character there, but chose Fenchurch to avoid complications with Paddington Bear. She first appears as the unnamed girl in the caf√© on the first page of ; she is the girl referred to as \\"sitting on her own in a small caf√© in Rickmansworth.\\" In , when the Earth and everyone including Fenchurch had mysteriously reappeared, a romantic relationship blooms between her and Arthur Dent. He teaches her to fly, before a first aerial sexual encounter, and a second with Sony Walkmen. At the beginning of , Fenchurch is referred to as having vanished abruptly during a hyperspace jump on their first intergalactic holiday. Douglas Adams later said that he wanted to get rid of the character as she was getting in the way of the story. Much of this is evident from the self-referential prose surrounding Arthur and Fenchurch's relationship. In , she is revealed to have been working as a waitress at Milliways since she vanished, and is reunited with Arthur Dent. In to and Fenchurch is played by actress Jane Horrocks. She appears in the television series played by an uncredited actress for the \\"girl in a caf√© in Rickmansworth\\" segment from the second episode. Her appearance corresponds to the one described in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish. In the computer of the Tanngrisnir takes the form of Fenchurch in its programmed attempts to live out the sub-conscious desires of the ship's occupiers. While in this form she and Arthur talk and ponder together extensively, exacerbated by the effects of the ship's dark matter travel on people's emotions. Later in the book Arthur encounters another form of Fenchurch during a travel in hyperspace only to dematerialize, similar to his Fenchurch, across a plural zone into a different part of the universe. Appears in: * (unnamed cameo) * * (only mentioned in passing) * *Fenchurch Everris, mentioned in Destiny 1 and 2, was likely inspired by Fenchurch. = Frankie and Benjy Mouse = Frankie and Benjy are the mice that Arthur (et al.) encounter on Magrathea. Frankie and Benjy wish to extract the final readout data from Arthur's brain to get the Ultimate Question. Frankie and Benjy are, after all, part of the pan-dimensional race that created the Earth as a supercomputer successor to Deep Thought in order to find out the question to which the answer was 42. In the first version, the radio series, they offered Arthur and Trillian a large amount of money if they could tell them what the Question is. In later versions this was changed ‚Äì unfortunately for Arthur, they claim the only way to do this is to remove his brain and prepare it, apparently by dicing it. They promise to replace it with a simple computer brain, which, suggested Zaphod, would only have to say things like \\"What?\\", \\"I don't understand\\" and \\"Where's the tea?\\". Arthur objects to this (\\"What?\\" he says. \\"See!\\" says Zaphod), and escapes with the help of his friends. Frankie says: In , they are in fact the manifestations of Lunkwill and Fook, the pan- dimensional beings who designed and built Deep Thought, and were killed by Arthur Dent when they attempted to remove his brain. Appear in: * On radio, David Tate played Benjy Mouse and Peter Hawkins voiced Frankie Mouse. They appeared in . They also appeared in , where they were voiced by David Tate and Stephen Moore. = Frat Gadz = Frat Gadz wrote the handbook titled Heavily Modified Face Flannels, which is described by The Guide as \\"an altogether terser work for masochists\\" in . = Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer = In the Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer (referred to in the scripts as the \\"FPRO\\") does his best to annoy Zaphod by hosing him down, letting him think that he escaped to an Ursa Minor robot disco by body debit card, asking him for an autograph and teleporting away whilst Zaphod helps him with his respiratory problem ‚Äì that he is breathing. = Gag Halfrunt = Gag Halfrunt is the private brain care specialist of Zaphod Beeblebrox and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz. Halfrunt describes Beeblebrox as \\"Just this guy, you know?\\" In the radio series and books, he is responsible for the order to destroy Earth. His reason is that if the ultimate question is revealed, everybody would be happy and psychiatrists would be put out of business. In and , when he learns of two escaped Earth people (Arthur and Trillian), he orders the Vogons to attack the Heart of Gold, at around the same time that Arthur unwittingly sabotages the ship's computers by asking them to make a cup of tea. Halfrunt was played by Gil Morris in the TV show and by Jason Schwartzman in . In both these versions he only appears briefly. = Gail Andrews = In , Gail Andrews is an astrologer who is interviewed by Tricia McMillan about the impact that the discovery of the planet Persephone, or Rupert will have on astrology. She is an advisor to the President of the United States, President Hudson, but denies having recommended the bombing of Damascus. In the radio series, she appears in , and is voiced by Lorelei King. = Gargravarr = Gargravarr, the disembodied mind and custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex on Frogstar World B (\\"the most totally evil place in the galaxy\\"), suffers from real-life dualism and is therefore having trial separation with his body, which has taken his forename Pizpot. The dispute arose over whether sex is better than fishing or not, a disastrous attempt at combining the two activities, and his body going out partying too late. Since he has no physical form that can be seen, he leads those condemned to the Total Perspective Vortex by humming various morose tunes so that the condemned can follow the sound of his voice. Appears in: * Gargravarr was voiced on radio by Valentine Dyall. He appears in . = Garkbit = Garkbit is the Head Waiter at Milliways, the impossible \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\". He is professionally unfazed by Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian's unruly arrival. He has a fine sales patter and a very dry sense of humour. Appears in: * In the radio series Garkbit is played by Anthony Sharp, and appears in . In the television series, he is portrayed by Jack May and appears in . The book describes Garkbit as being a methane breather, with a life support system strapped discreetly to his thigh. = Genghis Tem√ºjin Khan = Son of Yes√ºgei, Genghis Khan is both a distant ancestor of Mr Prosser and was called \\"a wanker, a tosspot, a very tiny piece of turd\\" by Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged in \\"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\\", originally based on a sketch written by Adams and Graham Chapman. The short story also appears in some editions of The Salmon of Doubt. = Girl with a Master's degree = After leaving the Old Pink Dog Bar (in ) Ford Prefect discovers his life's work has been undeleted. He shares this discovery and some Ol' Janx Spirit with a working girl who has \\"a Master's degree in Social Economics and can be very convincing\\". Engrossed in his own writing, she leaves Ford and leaves with a client in a steel grey Han Dold limousine. Ford later overhears her saying \\"It's OK, honey, it's really OK, you got to learn to feel good about it. Look at the way the whole economy is structured...\\". = God = God, about to disappear in a puff of logic, from HitchHiker's TV seriesAside from being the favourite subject of author Oolon Colluphid (Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes, Who is this God Person Anyway? and Well That About Wraps it Up for God), God also makes a disappearance in the Guide's entry for the Babel Fish (\\"I refuse to prove that I exist,\\" says God, \\"for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing\\". \\"But,\\" says man, \\"The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.\\"). Majikthise worries about philosophers sitting up half the night arguing that there may (or may not) be a God if Deep Thought can give His phone number the next morning. Arthur, Fenchurch and Marvin visit God's Final Message to His Creation in . At least six other characters have the status of a god: Almighty Bob, the Great Green Arkleseizure, Thor, Rob McKenna, who is unknowingly a rain god, Gaia, the Greek goddess who personifies the Earth, and Cthulhu, who is one of the Great Old Ones from the Cthulhu Mythos. Gaia, Thor, and Cthulhu are among the deities interviewed by Hillman Hunter for the job of God of the Earth-refugee planet of Nano, with Thor being selected. = Gogrilla Mincefriend = An enterprising chap who addressed the problem of elevators refusing to operate because they had been afforded a degree of prescience (to facilitate their operation by allowing them to be waiting for you before you've even decided you want to go up or down a floor) but consequently became terrified of the future, and so taken to hiding in basements. Mincefriend became very wealthy when he patented and successfully marketed a device he had seen in a history book: the staircase. = Golgafrinchans = The Golgafrinchans first appear in . In the novel series, their appearances are all in and they appear in . In all formats, the story is essentially the same. Following their adventures at Milliways, Arthur and Ford teleport onto an \\"Ark Ship\\" containing a number of Golgafrinchans. This particular group consists of the Wodehousian \\"middle class\\" who have common, middle-management types of occupations. They were sent away from their planet under false pretences by the (upper class) \\"thinkers\\" and (working class) \\"doers\\" of their society, who deemed them useless. They were told that the entire society had to move to a new planet, with a variety of thin excuses, and that it was necessary for them to go first to prepare the new planet for their occupation. However, it turns out that one of the middle- men was necessary for survival, and as a result, the rest of the Golgafrinchan society died off (see below). They arrive on Earth, where they become the ancestors of modern humans, except in the novel Life, The Universe, and Everything, in which in the beginning it is mentioned that they ended up dying out instead of the cavemen.  Agda and Mella  Agda and Mella are Golgafrinchan girls that Arthur and Ford hit on. On Golgafrincham, Agda used to be a junior personnel officer and Mella an art director. Agda is taller and slimmer and Mella shorter and round-faced. Mella and Arthur become a couple, as do Agda and Ford. In a way Mella is very relieved because she has been saved from a life of looking at moodily lit tubes of toothpaste. Agda dies a few weeks later from a chain of events that Ford unknowingly starts by throwing the Scrabble letter Q into a privet bush: it startles a rabbit, which runs away and is eaten by a fox, who chokes on the rabbit and dies, contaminating a stream that Agda drinks from upon which she falls ill‚Äîit is said that the only moral that one could possibly learn from these occurrences is not to throw the letter Q into a privet bush. Agda and Mella only appear in the novel.  Captain  The Captain of the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B likes to bathe with his rubber duck (he spent practically the entire time he was captain of the B Ark and as much of his time on Earth, a total time of over three years, as has been documented in the bath) and has got a very relaxed attitude towards everything. The Captain also has a fondness for a drink called \\"jynnan tonnyx\\". His personality was based on Douglas Adams' habit of taking extraordinarily long baths as a method of procrastination to avoid writing. He was voiced by David Jason in the radio series and by Frank Middlemass in the LP album adaptation. On television, it was Aubrey Morris.  Great Circling Poets of Arium  These rock throwing poets can be seen in the Guide graphics in , heard about in and read about in . They are original inhabitants of Golgafrincham, one of whose descendants inspire the stories that caused the creation of the \\"'B' Ark\\" that Arthur and Ford find themselves on. The first part of their songs tell of how five princes with four horses from the City of Vassilian travel widely in distant lands, and the latter ‚Äì and longer ‚Äì part of the songs is about which of them is going to walk back.  Hairdresser  One of the Golgafrinchans on the prehistoric Earth, the hairdresser was put in charge of the fire development sub- committee. They gave him a couple of sticks to rub together, but he made them into a pair of scissors in the radio series, or curling tongs in the television and book series. He was played by Aubrey Woods in the radio series, by Stephen Greif in the LP album adaptation, and by David Rowlands on television.  Management consultant  The Golgafrinchans' management consultant tried to arrange the meetings of the colonization committee along the lines of a traditional committee structure, complete with a chair and an agenda. He was also in charge of fiscal policy, and decided to adopt the leaf as legal tender, making everyone immensely rich. In order to solve the inflation problem this caused, he planned a major deforestation campaign to effectively revalue the leaf by burning down all the forests. He was played by Jonathan Cecil in the radio series, by David Tate in the LP album adaptation, and by Jon Glover on television.  Marketing girl  Another Golgafrinchan on prehistoric Earth, the marketing girl assisted the hairdresser's fire development sub-committee in researching what consumers want from fire and how they relate to it and if they want it fitted nasally. She also tried to invent the wheel, but had a little difficulty deciding what colour it should be. She was played by Beth Porter both in the radio series and on television and by Leueen Willoughby in the LP album adaptation.  Number One  Number One is the First officer in the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B. He is not very smart, having difficulty tying up his shoelaces, but is regarded by the captain as a nice chap. His only function to appear in the series is to offer Ford and Arthur drinks. He was voiced by Jonathan Cecil in the radio series and by David Tate in the LP album adaptation. On television, the character was renamed Number Three and played by Geoffrey Beevers.  Number Two  Number Two is a militaristic officer in the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B. He belongs to the Golgafrinchan 3rd Regiment. He captures Arthur and Ford and interrogates them. When they land on Earth, Number Two declares a war on another, uninhabited continent, leaving an \\"open-ended ultimatum\\", blows up some trees which he claims are \\"potential military installations,\\" and 'interrogates' a gazelle. He likes shouting a lot, and thinks the Captain is an idiot. He is played by Aubrey Woods in the radio series and by Stephen Greif in the LP album adaptation. On television, the character was divided into two different characters: Number Two played by David Neville on the planet Earth, and Number One played by Matthew Scurfield on the B Ark.  Telephone Sanitizer  The Golgafrinchan telephone sanitizer is in . By tragic coincidence, after all the telephone sanitizers were sent away with the rest of the \\"useless\\" Golgafrinchans, the rest of the society died off from an infectious disease contracted from an \\"unexpectedly dirty\\" telephone. = Googleplex Starthinker = In the scripts for , the first programmer asks Deep Thought if it is not \\"a greater analyst than the Googleplex Starthinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five-week Aldebaran sand blizzard?\\", which the great computer dismisses because he has already \\"contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself\\". The Googleplex Starthinker also appears in and . Note the much later use (but same spelling) of Googleplex for the Google corporate headquarters, another homage to the number googolplex. = Great Green Arkleseizure = The creator of the universe, according to the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI. Their legend has it that the universe was sneezed out of the nose of the Great Green Arkleseizure, and they thus \\"live in perpetual fear of the time they call 'The Coming of the Great White Handkerchief.'\\" In the movie, Humma Kavula, played by John Malkovich, is a missionary of the Great Green Arkleseizure religion on Viltvodle VI, ending his sermons with a simple \\"Bless you\\". The Jatravartid's God appears (conceptually) in , , and . = Great Hyperlobic Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler = A great computer, which according to Deep Thought, can \\"talk all four legs off an Arcturian Megadonkey\\" (although Deep Thought could allegedly persuade said Megadonkey to go for a walk afterwards), from . = Grunthos the Flatulent = Grunthos the Flatulent was the poetmaster of the Azgoths of Kria, writers of the second worst poetry in the universe, just between Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings and the Vogons. The guide recites a tale of how, during a reading of his poem \\"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning\\", \\"four of the audience died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived only by gnawing one of his own legs off.\\" Reportedly \\"disappointed\\" by the reception of his poem, Grunthos then prepared to read his 12-book epic, My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles (or Zen and the Art of Going to the Lavatory in ). He was prevented from doing so when his small intestine leapt up his neck and throttled his brain in a desperate bid to save civilization, killing him. Excerpt from \\"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning\\", taken from the TV series graphics: :Putty. Putty. Putty. :Green Putty ‚Äì Grutty Peen. :Grarmpitutty ‚Äì Morning! :Pridsummer ‚Äì Grorning Utty! :Discovery..... Oh. :Putty?..... Armpit? :Armpit..... Putty. :Not even a particularly :Nice shade of green. Excerpt from \\"Zen And The Art Of Going To The Lavatory\\", also taken from the TV series :Relax mind :Relax body :Relax bowels :Relax. :Do not fall over. :You are a cloud. :You are raining. :Do not rain :While train :Is standing at a station. :Move with the wind. :Apologise where necessary. Appears in: *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy = Guide Mark II = In the fifth novel, the Guide Mark II is used by the Vogons to help them destroy all the many Earths that appear in the novels. By using reverse temporal engineering throughout the book, the Guide Mark II ‚Äì which takes on the appearance of a bird with Unfiltered perception ‚Äì cajoles the cast to their final destination at Club Beta on Earth to first re-meet Agrajag and then be destroyed by the Vogons. = Hactar = Flexible and imaginative, Hactar was the first computer whose individual components reflected the pattern of the whole. Hactar is assembled and programmed by the Silastic Armourfiends, who then order him to assemble an \\"Ultimate Weapon.\\" Hactar, receiving no other guidance from the Armourfiends, takes the request literally and builds a supernova bomb which would connect every major sun in the universe through hyperspace, thus causing every star to go supernova. Deciding that he could find no circumstance where such a bomb would be justified, Hactar builds a small defect into it. After discovering the defect, the Armourfiends pulverize Hactar. Rather than being destroyed, Hactar is merely crippled. He can still manipulate matter, but even a simple item takes millennia to manufacture. Over √¶ons Hactar moves and recombines to become a dark cloud surrounding Krikkit, isolating the inhabitants. Deciding that the decision not to destroy the universe was not his to make, he uses his influence to make them build their first space ship and discover the universe; he then manipulates them into the same rage which the Armourfiends possessed, urging that they destroy all other life; Hactar has reassembled the supernova bomb, this time in working condition. After an incredibly long and bloody galactic war, Judiciary Pag banishes Krikkit to an envelope of \\"Slo-Time\\" to be released after the rest of the universe ends. At the end of , after his scheme fails, Hactar slips the cricket-ball-shaped supernova bomb to Arthur Dent, who then accidentally saves the Universe again by being an abysmal cricket bowler. Appears in: * He is played on radio first by Geoffrey McGivern, in a flashback for which McGivern is not credited during . He is then voiced by Leslie Phillips, appearing again in . = Haggunenon Underfleet Commander = The Underfleet Commander reports directly to the Haggunenon Admiral. The admiral had gone off for a quick meal at Milliways, where Ford and Zaphod attempted to steal his/her/its/their flagship. But as it had a pre- set return course, it resumed its place at the front of about a hundred thousand horribly be-weaponed black battle cruisers. But because the Haggunenons have very unstable DNA and change their shape/appearance at random and often inconvenient times, the Underfleet Commander mistakenly assumes that Zaphod and Trillian are, in fact, actually the admiral. The Underfleet Commander only appears in , voiced by Aubrey Woods. The Haggunenons were written out of subsequent versions, as they were originally co-written with John Lloyd, although they did appear in some stage adaptations. Haggunenons are greatly inconvenienced by their genetic instability and so have vowed to wage terrible war against all \\"filthy, rotten, stinking, same-lings.\\" A similar creature appears on the BBC TV series Red Dwarf. There is a shapeshifting Dungeons & Dragons monster called a \\"hagunemnon.\\" = Heimdall = Keeper of the gate into Asgard. Appears in . = Hig Hurtenflurst = Hig Hurtenflurst \\"only happens to be\\" the risingest young executive in the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation. During , he is on Brontitall. What he is doing there is something of a mystery, as the Shoe Event Horizon was reached long ago and the survivors of the famine have long since evolved into bird people and set up home inside a fifteen-mile high statue of Arthur Dent. His foot- warriors capture Arthur Dent and three Lintilla clones, who are threatened by Hurtenflurst to be \\"revoked. K-I-L-L-E-D, revoked\\". He then proceeds to show them a film about the activities of the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation, which is interrupted by Marvin, who has cut the power in order to rescue Arthur and the Lintillas. He appeared in played by Marc Smith. He has not appeared in any versions after this. = Hillman Hunter = Hillman Hunter is an Irish property developer from Earth who has been tricked by Zaphod into moving to a planet created by Magrathea. He interviews various gods, as he is keen to employ Thor to keep the society he has created on the planet devoutly controlled. He acts as a \\"stereotype Paddy from a bygone era\\" using phrases such as Bejaysus and invoking leprechauns. He is a major character in . He has considerable problems with the Tyromancers from an alternative reality who have also settled on the planet. Like Ford Prefect, whose name derived from the Ford Prefect automobile, Hillman Hunter's name derives from an automobile sold in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. In the radio series Hexagonal Phase, Hunter was played by Ed Byrne. = Hotblack Desiato = A branch of Hotblack Desiato estate agents, after which the character was named, at Camden Town. Hotblack Desiato is the guitar keyboard player of the plutonium rock group Disaster Area, claimed to be the loudest band in the universe, and in fact the loudest sound of any kind, anywhere. So loud is this band that the audience usually listens from the safe distance of thirty seven miles away in a well- built concrete bunker. Disaster Area's lavish performances went so far as to crash a space ship into the sun to create a solar flare. Pink Floyd's lavish stage shows were the inspiration for Disaster Area. In the book he is described as being connected to a \\"death support system\\" and communicates only by supernatural means. At the time when the main characters meet him, in , Hotblack is spending a year dead \\"for tax reasons\\". This is likely a spoof of the prominent UK performers who lived outside the country as tax exiles during the 1970s due to the laws that could result in a marginal tax rate over 90% for high income earners. Such tax exiles included singers Cat Stevens, David Bowie and Shirley Bassey; members of the rock groups Pink FloydHugh Fielder Pink Floyd: Behind the Wall, Race Point Publishing, 2013, p. 132 and Bad Company; and actor Michael Caine. The character is named after an estate agency based in Islington, with branches throughout North London. Adams said he was struggling to find a name for the character and, spotting a Hotblack Desiato sign while driving, liked the name so much he \\"nearly crashed the car\\" and eventually telephoned to ask permission to use the firm's name for a character. Apparently, the firm later received phone calls telling them they had a nerve naming their company after Adams's character. The Disaster Area sub-plot was first heard in the LP album adaptations and later in . It replaces the Haggunenon material from . The character appears in , and his ship in . He does not have any lines (due to being technically dead), and is played by Barry Frank Warren. The B-side of the 7-inch single of the Hitchhiker's Guide TV Series theme music featured a performance of a song entitled \\"Only The End of the World Again\\", credited to 'Disaster Area'. = Humma Kavula = Humma Kavula is a semi-insane missionary living amongst the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI, and a former space pirate. (It was presumably during his time as a pirate that he lost his legs and had them replaced with telescoping mechanical spider appendages). He wears thick glasses, which make his eyes appear normal when worn; however, when he removes the glasses, he appears to have shrunken black pits where his eyes should be. He seems to be a religious leader on that planet, preaching about the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief. Hence, his sermons end with the words \\"Bless You\\" rather than \\"Amen\\" as all the Jatravartids sneeze stimultaneously at the end of a 'prayer'. (See Jatravartids). He also ran against Zaphod Beeblebrox in the campaign for President of the Galaxy with the campaign slogan \\"Don't Vote For Stupid,\\" but lost, and has remained bitter about it ever since. In the film he is seeking the point-of-view gun to further his religion's acceptance (presumably), and he takes one of Zaphod's two heads and one of his three arms (though we do not see this, but Zaphod says while attempting to avoid the thermonuclear missiles above Magrathea \\"I can't do this without my third arm\\") hostage to ensure his help. While the Jatravartids were mentioned in the books, the character of Humma Kavula was created by Adams for . Quoting Robbie Stamp: \\"All the substantive new ideas in the movie, Humma, the Point of View Gun and the \\"paddle slapping sequence\\" on Vogsphere are brand new Douglas ideas written especially for the movie by him.\\" Appears in: *the 2005 film The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, played by John Malkovich. = Hurling Frootmig = Hurling Frootmig is said to be the founding editor of the Hitchhiker's Guide, who \\"established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust.\\" Later, after much soul-searching, he re-established the Guide with its \\"principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both, and went on to lead the Guide to its first major commercial success.\\" He is mentioned in . He did not make , but was mentioned in . = Judiciary Pag = His High Judgmental Supremacy, Judiciary Pag, L.I.V.R. (the Learned, Impartial, and Very Relaxed) was the chairman of the board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial. He privately called himself Zipo Bibrok 5 √ó 108 (which is five hundred million or half a billion in short-scale terminology). It was Judiciary Pag's idea that the people of Krikkit be permanently sealed in a Slo-Time envelope, and the seal could only be broken by bringing a special Key to the Lock. When the rest of the universe had ended, the seal would be broken and Krikkit could continue a solitary existence in the universe. This judgement seemed to please everybody except the people of Krikkit themselves, but the only alternative was to face annihilation. Pag appears to be related to Zaphod Beeblebrox; they share the same carefree and charming attitude, and Pag's real name (Zipo Bibrok 5 √ó 108) appears to be a mutation of Zaphod's name. (They also share the initials Z.B.) Since the Beeblebrox family lives backwards in time, Pag (despite living in the distant past) is therefore one of Zaphod's descendants. Appears in: * He is played on radio by Rupert Degas, and appears in . = Karl Mueller = Karl Mueller operates a nightclub, Club Alpha, in New York City. He is German with a Greek mother, and was handed the running of the club by his brother Stavro Mueller, who renamed Club Alpha with his own name. He appears in , in the storyline regarding the final death of Agrajag. = Know-Nothing Bozo the Non- Wonder Dog = A dog belonging to advertiser Will Smithers which was so stupid that it was incapable of eating the right dog food on camera, even when engine oil was poured on the wrong food. It was so named because its hair stuck upright on its head in a way that resembled Ronald Reagan. It also had an adverse reaction whenever someone said the word \\"commies\\". Bozo barked at Arthur when he considered entering the Horse and Groom pub on his return to Earth in So Long and Thanks for all the Fish. = Krikkiters = Ford, Arthur, Trillian and Slartibartfast meet a group of murderous Krikkiters on the surface of their planet. Away from the influence of Hactar, they are troubled by their Elders wanting to destroy the Universe as they are keen to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy. They appear in and the Tertiary Phase of the radio series. They're described as being white, but that's nearly all the indication of their appearance in the book series, but the cover of the CD version of the Tertiary Phase features a drawing of the robots, one of them batting a Cricket ball. On the image, they look rather like Marvin from the 2005 movie, only with longer legs, and smaller heads, including sunglasses-like eyes and antennae, like a play on their name. = Kwaltz = Kwaltz is one of the Vogons on Vogsphere, directing Jeltz's Vogon Constructor Fleet during the demolition of Earth and enforcing the galaxy's bureaucracy. He is the partner and advisor of vice-president Questular Rontok, who seems to care more about winning Zaphod's affections than retrieving the Heart of Gold. Kwaltz also leads a team of a few hundred Vogons to capture the president's kidnapper in the penultimate scene of the movie, a chase which takes them to Magrathea, where they discover and capture Marvin the Paranoid Android (not shown), then to Earth Mark II, where they shoot up Arthur Dent's house, and are finally defeated by Marvin who gives them all a lethargic and depressed nature, at least for the moment, by use of the Point-of-view gun which, oddly enough, works on non-organic life forms. Appears in: *, voiced by Ian McNeice. = Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton = Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton is described in the original radio script as \\"a sort of Margaret Thatcher, Penelope Keith character.\\" She is responsible for christening the \\"very splendid and worthwhile yellow bulldozer\\" which knocks down Arthur Dent's house in \\"cruddy Cottington\\", and it gives her \\"great pleasure\\" to make a \\"very splendid and worthwhile\\" speech immediately beforehand. She only appears in , where she was voiced by Jo Kendall. Her \\"very splendid and worthwhile\\" lines were entirely dropped from later versions. = The Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob = The Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob is a small man with a strange hat who guards God's Final Message to His Creation, and who sells Arthur and Fenchurch a ticket to it before passing them on a scooter and imploring them to \\"keep to the left\\". Introduced by Prak in the epilogue to , he finally appears towards the end of when we also realize that he has been a regular visitor to Wonko The Sane, who describes angels with golden beards and green wings, Dr Scholl sandals, who eat nachos and do a lot of coke. He says that he runs a concession stand by the message and when Wonko says \\"I don't know what that means\\" he says \\"no, you don't\\". = Lallafa = Lallafa was an ancient poet who lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa. His home inspired him to write a poetic opus known as The Songs of the Long Land on pages made of dried habra leaves. His poems were discovered years after Lallafa's death, and news of them quickly spread. For centuries, the poems gave inspiration and illumination to many who would otherwise be much more unhappy, and for this they are usually considered around the Galaxy to be the greatest poetic works in existence. This is remarkable because Lallafa wrote his poems without the aid of education or correction fluid. The latter fact attracted the attention of some correction fluid manufacturers from the Mancunian nebula. The manufacturers worked out that if they could get Lallafa to use their fluids in a variety of leafy colours in the course of his work, their companies would be as successful as the poems themselves. They therefore traveled back in time and persuaded him -- in the book, by explaining the situation, with difficulty; in the radio adaptation, by beating him -- to go along with their plan. The plan succeeded and Lallafa became extremely rich, but spent so much time on chat shows that he never got around to actually writing The Songs. This was solved by each week, in the past, giving Lallafa a copy of his poems, from the present, and having him write his poems again for the first time, but on the condition that he make the odd mistake and use the correction fluid. Some argued the poems were now worthless, and set out to stop this sort of thing with the Campaign for Real Time (a play on Campaign for Real Ale), or CamTim, to keep the flow of history untampered by time travel. Slartibartfast is a member of CamTim. (The necessity for this campaign is contradicted by other events in the novels. For example, when Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect landed on primitive Earth, they decided that nothing they could do would change history. And when Agrajag diverted him to a Cathedral of Doom to try to kill him, Arthur Dent's perpetual victim said that he'd try to kill Dent even if it were a logical impossibility, Dent not having ducked a bullet yet.) Lallafa appears in and . = Lazlar Lyricon = A customizer of starships to the rich and famous time travellers, who first appeared in , and later in and . Ford Prefect apparently believes that \\"the man has no shame.\\" His trademark is an infra-pink lizard emblem. = Lig Lury, Jr = The fourth editor of the Guide, who never actually resigned from his job. He simply left one morning for lunch and never returned to his office, making all later holders of the position \\"Acting Editors.\\" His old office is still preserved by the Guide employees in the hope that he will return. His desk sports a sign that reads \\"Missing, presumed fed.\\" = Lintilla = Lintilla is a rather unfortunate woman who has (as of ) been cloned 578,000,000,000 times due to an accident at a Brantisvogan escort agency. While creating six clones of a wonderfully talented and attractive woman named Lintilla (at the same time another machine was creating five hundred lonely business executives, in order to keep the laws of supply and demand operating profitably), the machine got stuck in a loop and malfunctioned in such a way that it got halfway through completing each new Lintilla before it had finished the previous one. This meant that it was for a very long while impossible to turn the machine off without committing murder, despite lawyers' best efforts to argue about what murder actually was, including trying to redefine it, repronounce it, and respell it in the hope that no one would notice. Arthur Dent encounters three of her on the planet of Brontitall, and takes a liking to (at least) one of them. He kills one of three male anti-clones, all called Allitnil (Lintilla backwards), sent by the cloning company to get her to \\"agree to cease to be\\" (although the other two of her \\"consummate\\" this legal agreement with their respective anti- clones). When Arthur leaves Zaphod, Ford, and Zarniwoop stranded with the Ruler of the Universe and his cat (at the conclusion of ), he takes one of the Lintillas with him aboard the Heart of Gold. All Lintillas were played by the same actress: Rula Lenska. Lintilla (and her clones) appeared only in the final three episodes of the second radio series. Rula Lenska did return to the fourth and fifth radio series ‚Äì she was first an uncredited \\"Update Voice\\" for the Hitchhiker's Guide itself and then played the Voice of the Bird (the new version of the Guide introduced in ). Zaphod noted in the new series that the new Guide has the same voice as \\"those Lintilla chicks.\\" The footnotes of the published scripts make the connection, confirming that the bird is actually an amalgam of the Lintilla clones, the solution alluded to in the second series. Lintilla and her clones (of which at the end there are now more than 800,000,000,000 ‚Äì \\"800 thousand million\\") do make a re-appearance of sorts on the Heart of Gold in an alternate ending to (which can only be heard on CD). The Lintillas do not appear in the novels nor in the BBC television series. The name Lintilla was reused for an adult-oriented multiple worlds talker that opened in 1994. The scripts for the radio series make it clear that The Three Lintillas are \\"NOT an Italian High Wire Act, though I'm sure we don't actually need to mention this fact, only perhaps, well I don't know put it in anyway\\" (script for ). = Loonquawl and Phouchg = :See Phouchg and Loonquawl = The Lord = The Lord is a cat, owned by The Ruler of the Universe. He might like fish and might like people singing songs to him, as the Ruler of the Universe isn't certain if people come to talk to him, or sing songs to his cat or even if the cat exists at all. Appears in: * * = Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop = A man who never married. Had he done so, and forgotten his wife's birthday for the second year, he would have globbered. This definition of globber casts doubt on the usefulness of Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Language Ever. (Life, the Universe and Everything) = Lunkwill and Fook = Lunkwill and Fook are the two programmers chosen to make the great question to Deep Thought on the day of the Great On-Turning. Appear in: * On TV, Antony Carrick plays Lunkwill and Timothy Davies plays Fook, and they appear in . On radio, the characters are just called First computer programmer and Second computer programmer, and appear in , and are played by Ray Hassett and Jeremy Browne respectively. In they are merged with the characters of Frankie and Benjy Mouse. Jack Stanley plays Lunkwill and Dominique Jackson plays Fook. = Magician = Appears wandering along a beach in , but no one needs him. = Majikthise and Vroomfondel = Majikthise and Vroomfondel may (or may not) be philosophers. They quite definitely appear as representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and other Professional Thinking Persons. When the supercomputer Deep Thought is being programmed to determine the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, they declare a demarcation dispute since the search for ultimate truth is the \\"inalienable prerogative of your professional working thinkers\\". They insist on rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty, and demand Deep Thought be switched off immediately. They are disarmed when Deep Thought, already committed to its seven and a half million years' calculation, suggests that a great deal of money can be made by philosophers willing to exploit the expected media interest. It is later apparent that their distant descendants revere them as \\"the greatest and most truly interesting pundits the universe has ever known.\\" Appear in: * On radio, Majikthise was played by Jonathan Adams, and Vroomfondel was played by Jim Broadbent. In the television series (but not on The Big Read), David Leland played Majikthise and Charles McKeown played Vroomfondel. The characters were omitted from . = Max Quordlepleen = Max Quordlepleen is an entertainer who hosts at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe and the Big Bang Burger Bar (or \\"Big Bang Burger Chef\\" in the original radio version). His feelings about the Universe outside of his onstage persona are unclear, but he has witnessed its end over five hundred times. His name is derived from a phenomenon during a rocket's ascent. Appears in: * On radio, Roy Hudd played him. On television, it was Colin Jeavons. He re-appears in the final episode of , played by Roy Hudd again. = Mo Minetti = In , it is Mo Minetti who had left, due to pregnancy, being the anchor the USAM TV breakfast show which Tricia McMillan is in New York to try out for. Apparently, she declined, surprisingly for reasons of taste, to deliver her child on the air. = Murray Bost Henson = Murray Bost Henson is \\"a journalist from one of those papers with small pages and big print\\" as Arthur Dent puts it. He is a friend of Arthur's whom Arthur phones one day to find out how he can get in touch with Wonko the Sane, and uses incredibly odd idioms in conversation, including such phrases as \\"my old silver tureen\\", \\"my old elephant tusk\\" and \\"my old prosthetic limb\\" (as terms of endearment) and \\"the Great Golden Spike in the sky\\" (referring to the death-place of old newspaper stories). He is played in by Stephen Fry. = Old Man on the Poles = Played by Saeed Jaffrey in the old man on the poles on Hawalius, tells Arthur some old information wrapped up as news, and that everyone should have a beach house. The character appears in . = Old Thrashbarg = Old Thrashbarg first appears in , as a sort of priest on Lamuella, the planet on which Arthur becomes the Sandwich-Maker. He worships \\"Bob\\" and is often ignored by his villagers. Whenever he is questioned about Almighty Bob he merely describes him as \\"ineffable.\\" No one on Lamuella knows what this means, because Thrashbarg owns the only dictionary, and it is \\"the ineffable will of Almighty Bob\\" that he keeps it to himself. Someone who sneaked into his house while he was out having a swim found that \\"ineffable\\" was defined in the dictionary as \\"unknowable, indescribable, unutterable, not to be known or spoken about\\". In Fit the Twenty-Fifth and Fit the Twenty-Sixth of the radio series Old Thrashbarg is voiced by Griff Rhys Jones. = Old Woman in the Cave = Played by Miriam Margolyes in , the smelly Old Woman in the Cave in the village of oracles on Hawalius provides Arthur Dent with bad olfactory stimulation and a photocopied story of her life, suggesting he live his life the opposite way so he won't end up living in a rancid cave. This occurs in . The original, real \\"smelly goat\\" event happened during the Last Chance to See radio series, found on the Douglas Adams at the BBC CD as a \\"Pick of the Week\\". = Oolon Colluphid = Oolon Colluphid is the author of several books on religious and other philosophical topics. Colluphid's works include: *Where God Went Wrong *Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes *Who Is This God Person Anyway? *Well That About Wraps It Up for God *Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Guilt But Were Too Ashamed To Ask (A play on the title of a sex manual written by Dr. David Reuben which inspired a Woody Allen film) *Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been Forced To Find Out (Another play on that same title) Colluphid is also shown as the author of the book The Origins of the Universe in the first part of the Destiny of the Daleks serial of Doctor Who. The Doctor scoffs that he \\"got it wrong on the first line\\". The reference was inserted by Douglas Adams, who was at the time working as the show's script editor. An early version of Colluphid was the character Professor Eric Von Contrick appearing in a December 1979 episode of the BBC radio series The Burkiss Way, which was based on author Erich von D√§niken. \\"Spaceships of the Gods\\", \\"Some more of the Spaceships of the Gods\\", \\"It Shouldn't Happen to Spaceships of the Gods\\", were books by the fictional author who had a Gag Halfrunt-style accent and who is visited in the Adams-written sketch by the aliens to demand a cut of Von Contrick's profits. = Paul Neil Milne Johnstone = Paul Neil Milne Johnstone of Redbridge, Essex, was the writer, according to Adams, of the worst poetry in the universe. He appeared under that name in the original radio series and the first printings of the 1979 novelization (Pan Books, paperback, page 53). The real Paul Neil Milne Johnstone (1952‚Äì2004) attended Brentwood School with Adams, and they jointly received a prize for English. At the school, Johnstone edited Broadsheet, \\"the Artsphere Magazine\\" that included mock reviews by Adams as well as Johnstone's own poetry. Johnstone won an exhibition to study at Emmanuel College, Cambridge while Adams won an exhibition to St John's College. Johnstone achieved moderate prominence in the poetry world as an editor and festival organiser, including the 1977 Cambridge Poetry Festival. He died a few years after Adams of pancreatic failure. After he requested the removal of his name and address, Johnstone was replaced with \\"Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex\\" (a garbled form of his name). On the 1979 ORA042 vinyl record release, his name has been made indecipherable by cutting up that part of the mastertape and reassembling it in the wrong order. In the film version Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings has moved from Essex to Sussex. In the TV adaptation of the series, a portrait of Jennings was Adams with pigtails. A sample of Johnstone's poetry, taken from the animated readout in the TV series, is: :The dead swans lay in the stagnant pool. :They lay. They rotted. They turned :Around occasionally. :Bits of flesh dropped off them from :Time to time. :And sank into the pool's mire. :They also smelt a great deal. In the TV series, Jennings is reported as living at 37 Wasp Villas, Greenbridge, Essex, GB10 1LL which is neither an actual town nor a valid postcode. The real Johnstone lived at Beehive Court in Redbridge. = Phouchg and Loonquawl = In the first novel, Phouchg and Loonquawl received Deep Thought's answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything on the day of the answer, seven and a half million years (75,000 generations) after Deep Thought had been asked the question. They were chosen at birth for this task. The name \\"Phouchg\\" may be a bastardization of the word Fuck, as his predecessor's name is Fook. = Poodoo = Poodoo is a representative of the cloning company responsible for all the Lintilla clones. He arrives on Brontitall with Varntvar The Priest on a mission to 'revoke' the three Lintillas there by marrying them to their anti- clones, each of which is named Allitnil. The marriage certificates are actually legally binding forms that make the signers agree to terminate their existence, and the unctuous Poodoo may therefore be a lawyer of some sort. After two of the newly married couples disappear in unsmoke, Arthur shoots the third Allitnil dead and, after tying up Poodoo and Varntvar, forces them to listen to a recording of Marvin's autobiography, so as he says, \\"It's all over for them.\\" Poodoo only appears in , in which he is played by Ken Campbell. = Prak = In the epilogue of , a journalist with the Siderial Daily Mentioner tells of Prak and then collapses into a coma. Prak was a witness in a trial on Argabuthon where the Dwellers in the Forest were suing the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides. Prak was a messenger for Dwellers in the Forest sent to the other two parties to ask \\"the reason for this intolerable behaviour.\\" He would always walk away thinking about how well-thought out the reason was, but he would always forget what it was by the time he got back. The white robots of Krikkit broke into the court room to steal the Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice, as it was part of the Wikkit Gate Key. In so doing they may have jogged a surgeon's arm, while the surgeon was injecting Prak with truth serum, resulting in too high a dose. When the trial resumed, Prak was instructed to tell \\"the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth,\\" which he did, in its entirety. People at the scene had to flee or risk insanity as Prak told every single bit of the entire truth of the entire universe and all of its history, much of which they found ghastly. Prak recalled that many of the weird bits involved frogs or Arthur Dent. As a result, when Arthur Dent came to visit him in search of the truth, he nearly died laughing. He never did write down anything he discovered while telling the truth, first because he could not find a pencil and then because he could not be bothered. He has therefore forgotten almost all of it, but did recall the address of God's Last Message to His Creation, which he gave to Arthur when the laughter subsided. He died afterwards, not having recovered from his laughing fit. On radio he appears in and is voiced by Chris Langham, who had played Arthur Dent in the very first stage adaptation of the scripts of the first radio series, in 1979. = Pralite monks = Pralite monks are an order that undergo extreme mental training before taking their final vows to be locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives; consequently, the galaxy is full of ex-Pralite monks who leave the order just before taking their final vows. Ford visited the ex-Pralite monks to Mind Surf and learned the techniques he used to charm animals on prehistoric Earth long enough for him to kill them for food and clothing. = President Hudson = Fictional former president of the US who was publicly known to have had an affair with astrologer Gail Andrews in . One of his presidential orders was the bombing of Damascus or \\"Damascectomy\\" (the taking out of Damascus), an issue Andrews denied that she counselled him on. At the time of , Hudson had died for unknown reasons. = Princess Hooli = On the tri-d TV, Trillian Astra reports on the future wedding of Princess Hooli of Raui Alpha to Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty whilst Arthur is visiting Hawalius in . The seer who is showing Arthur the future news in order to demonstrate the sudden lack of need for future tellings quickly changes the channel. Arthur says that he knows her (referring to Trillian) and tells the seer to turn the channel back. The seer, thinking that Arthur was referring to the princess, replies \\"Look mate, if I had to stand here saying hello to everyone who came by who knew Princess Hooli, I'd need a new set of lungs!\\" = Mr Prosser = Mr L. Prosser is a nervous fat and shabby married 40-year-old road builder who would like to build a bypass right through Arthur Dent's house. He is unaware that he is a direct but very distant descendant of Genghis Khan which causes him to have occasional visions of Mongol hordes and a preference for fur hats and axes above the door. He unfailingly addresses Arthur as \\"Mr Dent.\\" After some negotiation with Ford Prefect (or with Arthur Dent in the radio series), he is temporarily persuaded to halt the demolition. This respite does not last because the Vogon demolish Earth. Prosser holds the distinction of having the very first line of dialogue ever in the Hitchhiker's Guide canon, as he is the first character (not counting The Guide itself) to speak in . Appears in: * * On radio, he was played by Bill Wallis and appears in . On television, he appears in , played by Joe Melia. He is played by Steve Pemberton in the movie version. He appears in , despite not appearing in , voiced by Bruce Hyman; this Prosser exists on a parallel Earth where the cottage he wishes to demolish is the home of both Arthur Dent and Fenchurch. = Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz = The Vogon Captain in charge of overseeing the destruction of the Earth, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz is sadistic, even by Vogon standards. When not shouting at or executing members of his own crew for insubordination, Jeltz enjoys torturing hitchhikers on board his ship by reading his poetry at them, then having them thrown out of an airlock into open space. Physically, Jeltz is described as being unpleasant to look at, even for other Vogons. Given that Ford Prefect describes Vogons as having \\"as much sex appeal as a road accident\\", one can only imagine how much worse Jeltz must appear. This may explain his disposition. It is revealed in that Jeltz had been hired by Gag Halfrunt to destroy the Earth. Halfrunt had been acting on behalf of a consortium of psychiatrists and the Imperial Galactic Government in order to prevent the discovery of the Ultimate Question. When Halfrunt learns that Arthur Dent escaped the planet's destruction, Jeltz is dispatched to track him down and destroy him. Jeltz is unable to complete this task, due to the intervention of Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, Zaphod's great-grandfather. In , Jeltz is once again responsible for the destruction of the Earth, this time presumably killing Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Arthur's daughter, Random. In , it is revealed that Jeltz did not kill Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Random. It is also revealed that he has a son called Constant Mown and that his space ship is called the Business End. \\"Prostetnic Vogon\\" may be a title, rather than part of his name, during (), two other Prostetnic Vogons are heard from. Also, in , Gag Halfrunt refers to Jeltz as \\"Captain of Vogons Prostetnic\\" (although this may have been a play on Halfrunt's accent). Appears in:  * * In the first radio series, he was played by Bill Wallis. On television, it was Martin Benson. In the third, fourth and fifth radio series, he was played by Toby Longworth, although Longworth did not receive a credit for the role during the third series. In the film, he is voiced by Richard Griffiths. Prostetnic is a play on the word prosthetic in regard to special effects make- up. Adams was known to have a very low opinion of monsters (describing them as \\"cod\\" meaning fake looking) during his tenure as a Dr Who writer. = Questular Rontok = Questular Rontok is the Vice President of the Galaxy. This character did not appear in the radio or television series or any of the novels, being introduced in the 2005 film. Rontok is desperately in love with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the fugitive President of the Galaxy, and he knows it, as she unsuccessfully tries to hide it. Throughout , Questular alternately tries to arrest Zaphod for stealing the Heart of Gold (even enlisting the help of the Vogons), protects his life (when endangered by Vogon blaster fire), and at one point beseeches him to just give the stolen spaceship up. Questular appears to be the \\"doer\\", performing all the real functions of the Presidency, whilst Zaphod enjoys his status as the figurehead President. After Trillian interrogates Zaphod by repeatedly zapping him with the Point-of-view gun and he learns that she is truly in love with Arthur Dent and not him, he and Questular end up together at the end of the film, Zaphod telling her \\"Let's trip the light fantastic, babe.\\" Questular is also severely jealous of Trillian for obvious reasons (\\"She's lying. She's skinny, and she's pretty, and she's lying!\\"), until Trillian and Zaphod part as lovers. In the early drafts of the film the character was male, and therefore somewhat different. In a deleted scene on the DVD, Questular expresses her love for Zaphod shortly after all the Vogons become depressed. In the 2005 movie, she is played by Anna Chancellor. = Raffle ticket woman = In , Arthur Dent and Fenchurch attempt to get to know each other in an especially grim public house near Taunton railway station, their conversation is somewhat thwarted by a woman selling raffle tickets \\"for Anjie who's retiring\\". The numbers on both the front and back of the cloakroom ticket prove highly relevant to the protagonist. = Random Dent = Originally prophesied by her father, Arthur Dent, after he hears a Vogon for the first time (\\"I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one.\\"), a disillusioned, teenaged Random Frequent Flyer Dent (the in-vitro progeny with Trillian Astra) is found in . The line is followed up in and , the 2005 radio series adaptation of this book. The new Poe-reminiscent black bird version of the Guide manipulates her (as it has the Grebulons and Ford Prefect), so she is indirectly responsible for the destruction of all possible Earths. Early in , Arthur travels from planet to planet by donating to \\"DNA banks\\", finding that when he makes these deposits, he can travel first class. Trillian, wishing to have a child, finds some of his sperm in a DNA bank (which was very easy, since he was the only donor of the same species) and uses it to conceive Random. Shortly before the events of , Random is kept in a dream sequence and frozen along with all the other main characters thanks to her telling the Guide Mark II to safeguard their lives. In her dream she is Galactic President and highly successful (having been rescued from Earth by a suspiciously girlish troop of unicorns) and marries a flaybooz (a large, guinea-pig-like creature named Fertle) to annoy her mother. When the Guide's batteries run out, she is released from her dream with all the other main characters. The events of the book then occur. Strangely, she seems affected by her dream sequence and often laments the loss of her position and her 'husband'. By the end of the book, Arthur proposes to go with her to find a good university for her to attend. Appears in: Quintessential Phase In , adapted from , she is played by Samantha B√©art. = Receptionists =  New York Hotel receptionist  In Tricia gets garbled messages via the receptionist from Gail Andrews. Tricia interprets the message \\"Not happy,\\" as meaning Gail Andrews wasn't happy with their interview.  Megadodo receptionist  Appearing in and the large, pink-winged, insectoid receptionist in the Megadodo offices points Zaphod using a petulant tentacle towards Zarniwoop's office, the one with a whole electronic universe in it, and is also bugged by Marvin who just wants someone to talk to. In , he directs Zaphod towards Zarniwoop's new office, having put on the old hippy act. = Reg Nullify = Reg Nullify leads the \\"Cataclysmic Combo\\" band at Milliways. His band‚Äîfrom ‚Äîperformed on the LP album/cassette re-recording of and , released as The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The role was played by Graham de Wilde. In 1980 the song was also released as a track on an EP (Original Records ABO 5). = Rob McKenna = Described by the scientific community in as a \\"Quasi Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer,\\" Rob McKenna is an ordinary lorry driver who can never get away from rain and he has a log-book showing that it has rained on him every day, anywhere that he has ever been, to prove it. Arthur suggests that he could show the diary to someone, which Rob does, making the media deem him a 'Rain God' (something which he actually is) for the clouds want \\"to be near him, to love him, to cherish him and to water him\\". This windfall gives him a lucrative career, taking money from resorts and similar places in exchange for not going there. Rob McKenna is, in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, a \\"miserable bastard and he knew it because he'd had a lot of people point it out to him...he disliked...everyone.\\" In the book, he is shown only twice, first when he splashes Arthur Dent, who is hitchhiking in a normal environment, on the side of a desolate road in England, for the first time on record. Second when Arthur meets him in a caf√©, in \\"Thundercloud Corner,\\" Rob McKenna's personal spot, which most people wouldn't venture near. But McKenna is mentioned throughout the book, especially when he is hailed by the media as a \\"Rain God,\\" though not in those terms. In the radio show, however, he picks Arthur up instead of ignoring him, and meets him again later, after he acquired his fame. He then has a much more positive attitude towards Life, the Universe, and Everything, and is thrilled to meet Arthur again. He explains, as the narrator does in the book, that \\"Quasi Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer\\" means, in layman's terms, a Rain God, but the media couldn't call him simply that, because it would suggest that the ordinary people knew something they didn't. He appears in , and and is played by Bill Paterson, who also played one of the Arcturan Megafreighter crew in . Rob McKenna is assumed to be English because that is where he is always driving round, trying to escape the elements, and where, thanks to the summer resorts who've heard of him, he will be confined until his death in the Quintissential Phase; but in the Quandary Phase, he has a Scottish-sounding voice. = Roosta = Roosta is a hitchhiker and researcher for the Guide, whom Ford Prefect knows at least in passing and holds in some regard (Ford describes him as \\"a frood who really knows where his towel is\\"). He carries a special towel infused with nutrients, wheat germ, barbecue sauce, and antidepressants, which can be obtained by sucking on different areas. The last two of these, he explains, are for use when the taste of the first two sickens or depresses him. He saves Zaphod Beeblebrox from a horrible death in the offices of the Guide (by taking him into the artificial universe in Zarniwoop's office), and is then kidnapped along with Zaphod and the left-hand tower of the Guide building by a squadron of Frogstar Fighters. In the radio series, he serves no other purpose than to provide conversation (and deliver the line \\"here Zaphod, suck this!\\") while the pair are travelling to the Frogstar. However, in the books, he instructs Zaphod to leave the office through the window instead of the door after the building lands. This allows Zaphod to remain in Zarniwoop's universe and survive the Total Perspective Vortex. In , Roosta is a much more officious, standoffish and antagonistic character than he appears in the radio series. Appears in: * and . * On radio, he was voiced by Alan Ford. = The Ruler of the Universe = The Ruler of the Universe is a man living in a small shack on a world that can only be reached with a key to an improbability field or use of an Infinite Improbability Drive. He does not want to rule the universe and tries not to whenever possible, and therefore is the ideal candidate for the job. He has an odd, solipsistic view of reality: he lives alone with his cat, which he has named 'The Lord' even though he is not certain of its existence. He has a very dim view of the past, and he only believes in what he senses with his eyes and ears (and doesn't seem too certain of that, either): anything else is hearsay, so when executive-types visit to ask him what he thinks about certain matters, such as wars and the like, he tells them how he feels without considering consequences. As part of his refusal to accept that anything is true, or simply as another oddity, \\"He talked to his table for a week to see how it would react.\\" He does sometimes admit that some things may be more likely than others ‚Äì e.g., that he might like a glass of whisky, which the visitors leave for him. In the radio adaptation of , Ford also meets Zaphod in the accounting department of the new Guide offices. Zaphod describes being bored by a man in a shack and his cat for over a year. Appears in: * * Referenced in: * He was voiced on radio by Stephen Moore (in the original Radio Times listing he was announced as being played by Ron Hate ‚Äì an anagram of \\"A.N. Other\\" or possibly \\"No Earth\\" ‚Äì because the show was so far behind schedule that the role had not been cast when the magazine went to print). = Russell = Russell is Fenchurch's burly, blonde-moustached, blow-dried brother. He picks up Arthur Dent in his car after Arthur arrives on Earth at the beginning of . Arthur and Russell take an instant dislike to each other. This is also the first time Arthur meets Fenchurch, his lover and co-flyer to be ‚Äì albeit she is asleep or in a comatose/fugue state and only utters one word ‚Äì \\"This\\" ‚Äì then lapses back into wherever she is. Fenchurch also doesn't like Russell ‚Äì he calls her \\"Fenny\\" which she dislikes intensely. He also tries to simplify her problems so he can explain and understand them better (for example, he tells Arthur that Fenchurch believes herself to be a hedgehog). He first appeared in , and when this was adapted to radio appears in , where he is played by Rupert Degas. = Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration Officials = In the story \\"Young Zaphod Plays it Safe\\", a young Zaphod visits the wreck of the Starship Billion Year Bunker that has crashed on the planet with the best lobsters in the Western Galaxy. He is accompanied by two Officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration and an empty spacesuit, as they search for aorist rods and a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Designer Person (babbling gently about a shining city on a hill) who it turns out has escaped to Earth. The Officials declare the planet ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha (Earth) must be made \\"perfectly safe\\". = Sheila Steafel = Whilst asleep in a cave on prehistoric Earth, Arthur Dent dreams of visiting comedian Sheila Steafel on the radio show Steafel Plus on 4 August 1982. Arthur, in his dressing gown, talks of missing Mars Bars, various types of tea, Radio 4's News Quiz, chat shows, The Archers and Just a Minute. \\"There is nothing quite like Kenneth Williams in the entire galaxy, I've looked!\\" Space, he says, is \\"staggering, bewilderingly dull\\": there is so much of it and so little in it, \\"it sometimes reminds me of The Observer\\". Adams wrote this segment specifically for Steafel's show, and Simon Jones appeared in character as Arthur Dent. Steafel can be regarded as a canonical Hitchhiker's character. = Shooty and Bang Bang = Shooty and Bang Bang are Blagulon galactic policemen. They pursue Zaphod Beeblebrox to the planet of Magrathea, whereupon they proceed to shoot at him. In the radio and television series this results in a hyperspatial field generator exploding and throwing Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect and Zaphod forwards in time to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. In the books, Arthur, Ford and Zaphod are saved from certain death when Marvin talks to the cops' spaceship, which subsequently becomes so depressed it commits suicide, disabling the cops' life support units and rendering them unable to breathe as they were described as being \\"methane breathers.\\" They claim to be well balanced and caring, while gratuitously shooting everything in sight. Shooty writes novels (in crayon), and Bang Bang agonizes for hours to his girlfriend about gratuitously shooting everything in sight. Bang Bang was played on radio by Ray Hassett and on television by Marc Smith. Shooty was played on radio by Jim Broadbent and on television by Matt Zimmerman. In the Illustrated Guide to the Galaxy, the pair are played by Douglas Adams and Ed Victor (his literary agent). The characters are never named in dialogue or in the novels, but are named in the original radio series scripts. The script notes describe how the pair were written as a parody of American cop show characters, particularly Starsky and Hutch. = Six Men = In their six starships, the Six Men are the only people who have, as far as anyone is aware, the key to the improbability field that locks away The Ruler of the Universe. This occurs in and . = Slartibartfast = Slartibartfast is a Magrathean, and a designer of planets. By the third novel, he has joined the Campaign for Real Time and convinces the main characters to join him to attempting to save the Galaxy from murderous robots. = Sperm Whale = A sperm whale called suddenly and instantly into existence by the Heart of Golds improbability drive, above the planet Magrathea alongside Agrajag (as a bowl of petunias), in place of two thermonuclear missiles that were targeting the ship prior. The whale has an existential life of discovery which lasts a minute before it hits the ground, leaving a large crater and whale remains. It appears in , , the movie, and . Voiced by Stephen Moore in the radio and TV series, and by Bill Bailey in the feature film. = Stavro Mueller = Ran Club Alpha in New York, visited by Tricia McMillan in . Stavro opens a second club in called Club Beta, which is where Arthur Dent narrowly escapes death from a blaster shot by his daughter Random Dent and the shot hits Agrajag who proclaims that Arthur keeps killing him in Life, the Universe and Everything. We are told that he was a Greek with a German father and has handed Club Alpha over to his brother Karl Mueller so Stavro can open a new club in London. In Stavro is an only child. = Strinder the Tool Maker = As Arthur is regarded as The Sandwichmaker from Bob on the remote iron-age planet of Lamuella, Strinder makes knives to cut the Perfectly Normal Beast for his sarnies. From and . = Sulijoo = Another friend of Disaster Area's Hotblack Desiato, who Ford says agreed with him that Disaster Area was going to make Hotblack a star. Appears in . = Thor = Thor, a figure from Norse mythology, appears at Milliways, and is mentioned in , , and . He next appears in , at a party, where he is chatting up Trillian. Arthur tricks him into stepping out of the (flying) building by challenging him to a fight. In the radio adaptation of this he appears in , where he is played by Dominic Hawksley. Hawksley reprises the role in the radio adaptation of , , despite not appearing in that book. Two other characters from the Restaurant ‚Äì Max Quordlepleen and Zarquon ‚Äì also appear. Thor is a major character in , where he fights Wowbagger and protects the humans from Zaphod's dodgy weapons. Thor also appears in the Dirk Gently novel and radio series The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul. = Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides = These tribesmen fought with (in the epilogue of ) the Princes of the Plains in the land of the Dwellers in the Forest, to the detriment of the latter, for a really good reason, but Prak cannot remember why. = Trin Tragula = Trin Tragula was a speculative philosopher who invented the Total Perspective Vortex basically in order to annoy his wife. His wife thought he was an idiot who needed to \\"have some sense of proportion\\", exhorting her view frequently. When he attached his wife to the Total Perspective Vortex, the shock of seeing herself in relation to the rest of the universe instantly annihilated her brain. Although he was horrified by this, Trin Tragula found some satisfaction in discovering that the one thing that a person cannot afford to have in a universe this size is a sense of proportion. = Varntvar The Priest = He has only four lines in the programme, accompanying Poodoo and the Allitnils in the conspiracy to destroy Lintilla's clones. Varntvar is eventually forced to listen to a tape of Marvin's autobiography. He appears only in , in which he is played by Geoffrey McGivern. = Veet Voojagig = Veet Voojagig is described as \\"a quiet, young student at the University of Maximegalon\\", who initially studied ancient philology, transformational ethics and the Wave Harmonic Theory of Historical Perception. Then, after drinking some Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, he became obsessed with the problem of what happens to all the biros he'd bought over the years which had somehow disappeared. Voojagig claimed to have discovered the solution that they disappear to a world of their own, and claimed further to have worked on that world, working for a family of cheap green retractables. The character was described as ending up in \\"tax exile\\" ‚Äì and may have had a hand in \\"Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand [pen] business.\\" Also of note that when others visited the planet where Veet Voojagig claimed to have lived, all they found was a small asteroid inhabited by \\"a strange old man who repeatedly claimed that nothing was true, though he was later found to be lying.\\" Veet Voojagig appears in and is mentioned in . = Vroomfondel and Majikthise = :See Majikthise and Vroomfondel = War Command Krikkiters = Zaphod overheard the two War Command Krikkiters in the Robot War Zones, discussing the lassitude of the Krikkit War Robots, saying The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down. They just seem to get a little tired and a little grim ... and then they sulk. In (). = Will Smithers = Owner of a grey Porsche 928S (which Rob McKenna has been blocking for 20 miles) with a sticker that reads \\"My other car is also a Porsche\\", Will soaks Arthur Dent (and fails to give him a lift) when he is hitchhiking back on Earth at the beginning of . Will works in advertising and drinks in Arthur's local pub, the Horse and Groom and is owner of Know- Nothing Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog. = The Wise Old Bird = The Wise Old Bird is the leader of the Bird People of Brontitall. He does not like saying the word \\"shoe\\", as he and the bird people consider it unspeakable. The Bird People live in the right ear of a fifteen-mile-high statue of Arthur Dent, constructed by their ancestors. The \\"wise old bird\\" is a phrase which features in the nursery rhyme A Wise Old Owl :A wise old owl lived in an oak; :The more he saw the less he spoke; :The less he spoke the more he heard. :Why can't we all be like that wise old bird? The Wise Old Bird appeared in . He was voiced by John Le Mesurier who was originally intended to play the character of Slartibartfast. = Werdle Sneng = Werdle Sneng, in , has a book out, Bath Sheets in Space which is found adorning contemporary hot beverage tables, as it is far too large for anyone's pocket, fashionable or otherwise. = Wonko the Sane = Wonko's Toothpicks John Watson aka Wonko the Sane lives in coastal California with his wife, Arcane Jill Watson, in a house called The Outside of the Asylum (which features interior features on its outside and exterior on its inside). When Wonko saw instructions on how to use a toothpick on a packet of toothpicks, he became convinced that the world had gone crazy and so built the house as an asylum for it, hence the reversal of the interior and exterior. Arthur and Fenchurch pay Wonko a visit and learn that like both of them, he had also received a fishbowl from the dolphins (having been a marine biologist and close to them). He also claims to have seen angels with golden beards, green wings and Dr Scholl sandals, who drive little scooters, do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things. Arthur and Fenchurch discover the truth behind this after they have seen God's Last Message to His Creation. John Watson appears in . In the radio series, he is played by Christian Slater. = Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged = In contrast to most other immortals, Bowerick Wowbagger was not born one, but became immortal due to an accident with \\"an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch, and a pair of rubber bands\\", an event which no-one has been able to replicate without ending up looking rather silly or dead (or both). Unlike other immortals, whom he calls \\"a load of serene bastards\\", he doesn't cope very well with his infinite life, having not been born into it and thus lacking the innate ability to handle it. Finding something to do on Sunday afternoons causes him particular difficulties. Eventually he comes up with a plan to keep himself busy: he will insult every single living being in the universe ‚Äì in alphabetical order. He appears in , while insulting Arthur Dent with the phrase, \\"You're a jerk, a complete arsehole\\" (in the US changed to \\"...complete kneebiter\\"). Later, after Arthur escapes prehistoric Earth, Wowbagger shows up again in the present, but when he sees Arthur he says, \\"I've done you before, haven't I?\\" After Arthur, his next planned victim is A-Rth-Urp-Hil-Ipdenu, a slug he intends to call \\"a brainless prat.\\" In , one Arthur Philip Deodat is also a victim of Wowbagger, during the Krikkit Robot attack on Lord's Cricket Ground.

Just before his death, Yooden came to see Zaphod and presented his idea to steal the Heart of Gold. Following Yooden's suggestion, Zaphod locked out a section in each of his own brains so that no one could figure out why he ran for the presidency. Zaphod and Ford Prefect's first encounter with Yooden occurred when they were children on Betelgeuse and Yooden was a ship's captain. Zaphod had bet Ford that he could raid a heavily fortified Arcturan megafreighter and took Ford along for the attempt, using a souped-up trijet scooter. They successfully boarded the ship (captained by Yooden), stormed the bridge with toy pistols, and demanded conkers. Yooden gave them conkers, food, booze, and various other items before teleporting them to the maximum-security wing of the Betelgeuse state prison. = Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth = Zaphod Beeblebrox's father's name was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, and Zaphod's grandfather was called Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third. This was due to an \\"accident with a contraceptive and a time machine\\". The great-grandfather of Zaphod Beeblebrox, Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth is one of two active characters in books who are dead (see also: Hotblack Desiato). When Arthur Dent inadvertently freezes the systems on board Heart of Gold at the same moment Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz attacks, the younger Zaphod holds a s√©ance to contact Zaphod the Fourth. Zaphod the Fourth berates his great-grandchild for being generally self-absorbed and learns of the ship's imminent destruction. He stops time so he can continue deriding Zaphod, who tries (rather weakly) to defend his life. Zaphod the Fourth saves the ship and crew to keep his great-grandchild and his \\"modern friends\\" from joining him in the afterlife and thereby ruining the experience. When he learns that the ship had seized up to solve the dilemma of either making tea (in ) or figuring out why Arthur would want dried leaves in water (), he solves these problems before leaving by either leaving a pot of tea in the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer or by explaining to Eddie that \\"he's an ignorant monkey who doesn't know better\\", respectively. In the book Z.B. the Fourth approves of the tying up of all computer resources to make tea ‚Äì unlike everyone else present on the Heart of Gold at the time, including Arthur who originally made the request of Eddie. As a final note, Zaphod explains that his great- grandfather is \\"the Fourth\\" due to an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Zaphod the Fourth, therefore, bitterly refers to his great-grandson as \\"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth\\" (Zaphod tries to counter this by referring to himself as \\"the First\\"). Appears in: * * He was voiced on radio by Richard Goolden. = Zarniwoop [Vann Harl] = Zarniwoop works in the offices of the Guide, on Ursa Minor Beta. When Zaphod travels to Ursa Minor Beta to meet him, he is informed that Zarniwoop is unavailable and too cool to see him right now. He is in his office, but he's on an intergalactic cruise. Zaphod subsequently discovers that Zarniwoop's intergalactic cruise ship has spent 900 years on Brontitall (in ), or Frogstar B (in ), waiting for a complement of small lemon-soaked paper napkins, and every single passenger has aged considerably despite enforced hibernation. Only one person, who was not a passenger, but who hid himself on the spaceship, has not aged ‚Äì Zarniwoop. Zaphod subsequently learns that, before he sealed part of his own brain, he was collaborating with Zarniwoop to find out who rules the universe ‚Äì this being Zarniwoop's obsession. In the books, Zarniwoop is marooned on The Ruler of the Universe's planet by Zaphod et al. and is stuck outside the only shelter for weeks in driving rain, because The Ruler is unsure as to whether Zarniwoop's desperate thumping on the door is real or not. At the end of the second radio series, he is similarly marooned, but this time by Arthur, with Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox for company. In the Quintessential Phase radio series, Zarniwoop is revealed to be the same person as character Vann Harl (Zarniwoop is his first name), and a Vogon in disguise. He has escaped being left on the desolate planet and is masterminding the Guide's new all- powerful format. Appears in , , and . On the radio, Zarniwoop Vann Harl is voiced by Jonathan Pryce. His casting was accidental ‚Äì he had been hired to play a different role (The Ruler of the Universe, whose lines had apparently not been written in time). He was happy to return for the final series, however, when a lot more was revealed about the character, much of it appropriately sinister, Pryce now having become well known for playing villains. = Zarquon = Zarquon is a legendary prophet. He is worshipped by a small group visiting The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and is old, bearded, robed, wreathed in light, has starry eyes and a crown of gold. His name is frequently invoked as a curse, specifically a substitute for \\"God\\" or \\"fuck\\", such as \\"Holy Zarquon's singing fish\\" and \\"for Zark's sake\\" in the first meaning, and \\"you zarking frood\\" and \\"zarking fardwarks\\" (meaning \\"fucking hell\\") in the second meaning. It is only on our visit to Milliways that Zarquon does indeed appear ‚Äì his overdue second coming ‚Äì moments before the Universe ends (His last words are \\"How are we doing for time?\\"). The host Max claims that he had done the show \\"over five hundred times\\" and \\"nothing like this had ever happened before\\". He appears in , voiced by Anthony Sharp, in the book and in is played by Colin Bennett. He has a final brief cameo in played by William Franklyn. = Zem = Zem is an affable, yet quite staggeringly stupid, swamp dwelling mattress. The pocket-sprung lifeform flollops, willomies and glurries around Sqornshellous Zeta and tries his best to cheer up Marvin the Paranoid Android, who became stranded on the planet after having one arm welded to his side and one leg replaced by a steel pillar. Because of his limited intellect he has the same conversation with Marvin every day until the android leaves. After attempting to make conversation about the weather (Marvin: \\"The dew has fallen with a particularly sickening thud this morning... if I had teeth I would grit them at this point\\"), Marvin's life story, and the (formerly thriving) economy of Sqornshellous itself, Zem offers that Marvin should be more mattresslike in his outlook. Zem is the sole witness to Marvin's abduction by the Krikkit war robots. Note: \\"Zem\\" is the name of all Sqornshellous Zeta mattresses; as Zem himself puts it, \\"Some of us are killed, [i.e. taken away to be dried and slept on] but all of us are called Zem, so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to a minimum.\\" He appears in On radio, he is voiced by Andy Taylor.

Pistrucci was commissioned by the British government to create the large Waterloo Medal, a project which took him thirty years to complete. Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied briefly with other artists before striking out on his own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for most of the rest of his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long- term grievance for Pistrucci. Talented but temperamental, Pistrucci refused to copy the work of other artists. When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering portrait of him on the coinage be changed with a new likeness to be based on the work of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly dismissed. The Mint did not dismiss him, lest the money already spent on the Waterloo Medal be wasted. Pistrucci kept his place with the Mint for the rest of his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci's death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today. Early life and career (1783‚Äì1815)  Benedetto Pistrucci was born in Rome on 24 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (n√©e Greco). His elder brother Filippo displayed artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci wanted his sons to follow in his footsteps and sent them to Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys were enrolled in the Roman College. Napoleon had put a price on Federico Pistrucci's head, as he had prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so the family fled Rome when the French advanced towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school. Filippo satisfied his father with enough academic achievement that he was allowed to take a job with a painter named Mango. Deprived of his brother, Benedetto became despondent and was eventually allowed to work at Mango's. There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. Mango told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe Mango, a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver. He advanced quickly, also taking lessons from Stefano Tofanelli, and soon Giuseppe Mango was selling Pistrucci's carvings as his own. Realising that his works were being sold as counterfeit antiques, Pistrucci began placing a secret mark, the Greek letter Œª (lambda) on his creations. A Pistrucci cameo (1800) Pistrucci's obvious talent made his fellow apprentices envious, and one provoked a fight with him, stabbing him in the abdomen before Pistrucci fended off the attack. Recovering at home, he taught himself to model with wax. Federico Pistrucci decided his son would be better off with a new master, and secured a position for him with Giuseppe Cerbara, but the boy refused, believing that he would have to work in poor conditions. A place with gem-carver Nicolo Morelli was secured, and Pistrucci also attended the scuola del nudo art academy at the Campidoglio, where in 1800 he took the first prize for sculpture. Pistrucci felt Morelli was seeking to profit from his ability while giving him little training, and left his position at the age of 15, working from the family home. He was able to pay rent, as from the beginning he had ample commissions for cameos. Pistrucci's early clients included two of Rome's major art dealers, Ignazio Vescovali and Angelo Bonelli, and Napoleon's three sisters, Elisa, Pauline and Caroline. Pistrucci gained prominence by winning a competition to make a cameo of Elisa (the Grand Duchess of Tuscany), working nearly nonstop for eight days to complete it. The Grand Duchess was so impressed by his work that she gave him studio space at her palace. Pistrucci felt secure enough with this patronage that in 1802, he married Barbara Folchi, daughter of a well-to-do merchant; they had nine children together. He continued working in Rome, turning out portrait cameos and engraved gems, until 1814. Cameo, 1810 Bonelli returned from a successful trip to Britain in 1814 and proposed that Pistrucci go back with him, arguing that the artist's future was there. Pistrucci was willing, and after making provision for his family left Rome with Bonelli. They first stopped in Perugia so that Pistrucci could say farewell to his brother Filippo, but found him willing to accompany them. By Turin, Filippo Pistrucci had decided that Bonelli was not to be trusted, and so informed his brother. When they reached Paris in December 1814, the brothers refused to accompany Bonelli further, and after making threats, the dealer departed. Filippo soon returned to Italy, but Benedetto Pistrucci found his name and art were known in Paris, and set to work. He was there when Napoleon returned from Elba, beginning the Hundred Days, but worked on, unaffected by the war. He saw Napoleon in a garden, and always having a ball of wax with him, quietly modelled the emperor, the last portrait of him done in Europe. After the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, Pistrucci began preparations to move on to Britain, but it was not until 31 December that he arrived there.  Rise to prominence (1815‚Äì1819)  Reverse of the 1817 sovereign On arrival at Dover, Pistrucci had difficulty with Customs, possibly caused by Bonelli's malice. Once he was able to, he journeyed to London. He had letters of introduction to several people, and Charles Konig, Keeper of Minerals at the British Museum, proved a loyal friend. Through Konig, Pistrucci met the famous naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, who commissioned the artist to do a portrait of him. While Banks was sitting for Pistrucci, the connoisseur Richard Payne Knight came by, anxious to show Sir Joseph a cameo fragment he had purchased, and which he dated to Ancient Greece. After Banks praised it highly, Pistrucci, on examining it, identified it as his own work, displaying the secret mark he had placed on it. The incident increased Pistrucci's reputation in London. Pistrucci was introduced to Lord and Lady Spencer by Banks. Lady Spencer showed Pistrucci a model of Saint George and the Dragon by Nathaniel Marchant and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style as part of her husband's regalia as a Knight of the Garter. Pistrucci had already been thinking of such a work, and he produced the cameo. The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet's Hotel in Leicester Square, where he had stayed after coming to London. Sir Joseph commissioned Pistrucci to craft a cameo of King George III. As the King was ill with porphyria, Pistrucci modelled the likeness from Marchant's three-shilling bank token, and cut it in red jasper for a fee of 50 guineas. Banks showed the cameo to William Wellesley-Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington and the Master of the Mint, who was greatly impressed by the quality of what he saw. At this time, the Royal Mint was preparing to issue new gold and silver coins as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816, and in June of that year, Pole decided to hire Pistrucci to make models in stone for the new coinage that could be converted into steel dies by the Mint's engravers. Pole had Pistrucci create three portraits of the King in different sizes. Only two were used, one for the obverse of the half crown, and the other for the shilling and sixpence. Both were modified by Thomas Wyon of the Mint, who engraved the designs in steel. What was dubbed the \\"bull head\\" of the King on the 1816 half crown was disliked by the public, and it was replaced by another in 1817. The criticism incensed Pistrucci, who blamed Wyon for bungling the design, and who set about learning to engrave in steel himself. After completing Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci suggested to Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound that was to be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume on the history of the sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past. For a fee of 100 guineas (¬£105), Pistrucci created the sovereign's design, engraving it himself. He depicted the saint atop a fiery steed which is trampling the wounded dragon. George has a broken spear in his hand; part is in the dragon and the remainder on the ground. Pistrucci's original design, used for circulation in 1817‚Äì1819 and reprised by the Royal Mint in 2017, has the ribbon of the Order of the Garter surrounding the George and dragon design, with its motto HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE. The design, with Saint George bearing a sword rather than a spear, is ordinarily seen on the sovereign, and was also used for the crown from 1818. Clancy noted of the design process for the crown, \\"what emerges is the presence of Pole at each turn. He bombarded the young artist with suggestions and instructions on how the design should be changed from the shape of the sword to the perceived ferocity of the dragon.\\" Pistrucci had placed his full last name on both sides of the crown, for which he was criticised by the public, and some said the saint would surely fall off his horse with the next blow. After the death in 1817 of Thomas Wyon Sr, the father of the man who had adapted Pistrucci's designs, Pole most probably offered Pistrucci the post of chief engraver at the Royal Mint, with a salary of ¬£500 per annum. and a house within the grounds of the Mint. However, it soon appeared that a law passed under William III barred foreigners from the post, and so Pole left it vacant, while granting Pistrucci the salary and emoluments of the office. Sir John Craig wrote in his history of the Royal Mint: \\"The arrangement was not put into writing, and misunderstanding was easy for a foreigner. Pole categorically denied any commitment beyond the grant for the time being of a salary for coinage designs as cheaper than payment of fees. The Italian persistently contended that he was seduced into Mint service by a promise of formal appointment to the chief engravership\\". According to H.W.A. Linecar in his book on British coin designs and designers, \\"the arrangement might have worked very well, even though it was against accepted procedure, had Pistrucci been other than he was.\\" In 1819, Pistrucci was awarded the commission to design the Waterloo Medal, a huge piece some in diameter that the government planned to award to the victorious generals and national leaders who had defeated Napoleon. Such a medal had been proposed by the Prince Regent (later George IV) soon after the battle. Pistrucci's price was ¬£2,400, and the down payment allowed him to bring his family from Italy. The medal was originally supposed to be to a design by John Flaxman, but Pistrucci refused to engrave the work of another artist, and Pole allowed him to design his own medal, a decision that antagonised London's art establishment against Pistrucci. A gigantic undertaking, the medal would take Pistrucci 30 years to complete.  Conflict at the Mint (1820‚Äì1836)  A George IV sovereign, with the head so disliked by the King After the death of George III in 1820, Pistrucci prepared the coinage bust of the new King, George IV. The King despised Pistrucci's work for its bloated expression‚Äîaccording to Clancy, \\"its full features implying something of the appetites of the monarch\\". The King and Pistrucci also came into conflict over the Coronation medal, with the King objecting to being placed on the same level as the allegorical representations of his kingdoms. Pistrucci stated, \\"I shall elevate His Majesty\\", and did so. The King's toupee also caused difficulty in the engraving process. On the coinage, the sovereign was modified to remove its garter, and the saint's broken spear was replaced by a sword. Thus, it became very similar to the design used on modern-day sovereigns but for the lack of a streamer on Saint George's helmet. This version of the reverse was struck from 1821 to 1825, but Pistrucci's design would be thereafter absent from the sovereign from 1825 to 1874, after his death. Aware of King George's dissatisfaction at the coinage effigy, the Mint played for time. Pole's resignation in 1823 deprived Pistrucci of a friend and supporter at the Mint. Sculptor Francis Chantrey had prepared a bust of the King which the monarch liked, and ordered that it be placed on the coinage. Pistrucci would not copy the work of another artist, and refused. The new coinage of 1823‚Äì1825 was engraved by Pistrucci's assistant, Jean-Baptiste Merlen, and by William Wyon; Pistrucci was thereafter excluded from work on the coinage. The Mint considered sacking Pistrucci, but realised that if it did, the ¬£1,700 advanced for fees and expenses on the Waterloo medal would probably be wasted, and he kept his position and pay on condition he focused on the completion of the medal. Despite this, by 1826, only a portion of one side had been completed. Though the banishment of the George and Dragon design from the sovereign after 1825 was more part of a general redesign of the coinage than an attack upon Pistrucci, according to Clancy he \\"cannot have masked the sense he must have felt of tides turning against him\\". There was conflict at the Mint between Pistrucci and William Wyon, that sometimes involved Merlen. According to Graham Pollard in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \\"Pistrucci's temperament did not foster good relations with his colleagues at the mint; the insecurity of his position there was deepened by a spasmodic but bitter campaign conducted through the newspapers by his partisans and those of William Wyon.\\" Pistrucci appealed to each new Master of the Mint for appointment to the post of chief engraver. In 1828, the incumbent Master, George Tierney, worked a compromise that satisfied no one. Wyon was appointed as chief engraver, and Pistrucci as chief medallist, with the salaries of the top two engraving positions divided between them. Of Pistrucci's salary of ¬£350, ¬£50 was conditional on his training an apprentice. Pistrucci in succession named two of his sons, but the allowance was stopped after 1830 as it had come to light that each resided abroad, and one was not a British subject and so was ineligible for regular Mint employment. Pistrucci's understanding of the arrangement was that he would create such medals as might be ordered by government departments, with each medal a separate fee in addition to the annual salary. This effectively left Pistrucci with little to do at the Mint. He created several medallic works, for example a small memorial medal for the King's brother, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was popular, in royal circles, mounted in rings. He was asked to design the Coronation medal after King William IV came to the throne on George's death in 1830, but declined as he was asked to copy a bust by Chantrey, and the King refused to sit for him. He created, in 1830‚Äì1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. He took twelve months to do so, a period of time Craig found unduly long. He continued to cut cameos, and to work, slowly, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. March, tied his disinclination to work on the Waterloo Medal to his unhappiness about his position at the Mint, and he may have concluded that he would be sacked if he finished the medal. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, stated that he felt the medal could be finished in 18 months, and offered Pistrucci payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish it. Pistrucci declined.  Later career and death (1837‚Äì1855)  Pistrucci enjoyed a friendly relationship with Princess Victoria of Kent, the niece and heiress presumptive of King William, and cut several cameos of her. After she succeeded to the throne as Queen Victoria in 1837, Pistrucci was selected to sculpt her Coronation medal, which he did; the Queen granted him several sittings. Although the Queen was pleased, there were mixed reviews. When questions were asked in the House of Commons, Labouchere stated that Pistrucci may have been ill. Joseph Hume opined that the reverse was no better done than the cheap medals sold in the streets for a penny each. In 1838, Pistrucci made the silver seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, using a new process by which the punch or die could be cast in metal directly from the original wax or clay mould, rather than having to be copied by hand engraving. The following year, Pistrucci left for Rome to take up a position as chief engraver at the papal mint, but returned to London a few months later, deeming the salary too low. By the early 1840s, the Audit Office was questioning the amount spent on Pistrucci. In 1844, the Master of the Mint, William Gladstone restored Pistrucci's salary to the full ¬£350 and offered him ¬£400 to complete the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci moved his residence from the Mint on Tower Hill to Fine Arts Cottage, Old Windsor, and set to work in full earnest. He was slowed by injuries from a fall, and it was not until the beginning of 1849 that he submitted the matrices of the medal, and was paid the remaining balance of ¬£1,500. The matrices were so large no one at the Royal Mint was willing to take the risk of hardening them and possibly ruining three decades' work. So only soft impressions were taken, with no medals in gold, silver and bronze as intended, though replicas have since been minted from other dies. Even if the government had struck the medals, there was almost no one to present them to, for of the intended recipients, all were dead but the Duke of Wellington. The conflict between Pistrucci and William Wyon continued into the late 1840s, and sometimes featured in the press, contributing to the feeling that all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the Royal Mint was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief engraver (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and engraver to the Mint, to receive a salary in addition to payment for any work done. Pistrucci in 1850 moved from Old Windsor to Flora Lodge, Englefield Green, near Windsor, where he lived with his daughters Maria Elisa and Elena, both gem engravers. He continued to accept private commissions for cameos and medals. Pistrucci died there of \\"inflammation of the lungs\\", on 16 September 1855, and is buried at Christ Church, Virginia Water, Surrey.  Appraisal  Reverse of a 1911 (George V) sovereign, showing the main element of Pistrucci's original George and the Dragon design of 1817 Pistrucci is probably remembered most for his George and Dragon design for the sovereign. Not greatly liked at the time of its origin, it has come to be celebrated. The Deputy Master of the Mint who restored the design to the sovereign in 1871, Charles Fremantle, stated his view that \\"it is hardly possible to over-rate the advantages accruing to a coinage from an artistic and well-executed design\\". By 1893, it was on all of Britain's gold coins; The Art Journal described Pistrucci's design as having \\"triumphantly borne the test of time\\". Marsh noted, \\"it is indeed a tribute that his wonderful design should still adorn the gold coinage of our current Queen Elizabeth II. It is one of the finest ever in our coinage history, and has certainly stood the test of time. Long may it continue.\\" Pistrucci's design has also appeared on a non- circulating ¬£20 silver coin in 2013 and on the crown in 1818‚Äì1823, 1887‚Äì1900, 1902 and 1951. Roderick Farey, in his biographical articles on Pistrucci, described him as \\"an Italian with a fiery disposition, he had numerous arguments with the authorities but no-one could doubt his genius firstly as a cameo cutter and later as an engraver and medallist.\\" Those disputes, and a perceived slowness to complete his works (especially the Waterloo Medal) have been sources of the criticism by later writers. Howard Linecar, in his book on British coin designs and designers, wrote, \\"there is little doubt that Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies as a bargaining counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint ... On balance it is perhaps fair to say that Pistrucci, having probably been promised that which he could not have ... squeezed the last drop of blood out of the situation.\\" According to Clancy, \\"With great talent can often come controversy and throughout his career Pistrucci was acclaimed and reviled in equal measure, maintaining a series of tense relationships with his colleagues, the most pointed of which [was] with his fellow engraver William Wyon.\\" Craig concluded, \\"Apart from the George and Dragon design, which was less esteemed then than now ... this artist's Mint works, unlike his private commissions, were failures\\". The Waterloo Medal is regarded by many as a masterpiece on a par with his St George and the Dragon. Pollard stated that the Waterloo Medal, \\"shows Pistrucci's command of the types (or figures) of cameos, an understanding of the figurative language of the Roman Renaissance, and an appreciation of the antique sculptured relief‚Äîhis types, none the less, were always original\\". Marsh also praised the medal:, \\"no better piece of intaglio engraving or design has surely ever been seen before or since. It contains as much as thirty ordinary-sized medals, and this alone is more than most medalists achieved in a life time.\\" Farey concluded his study of Pistrucci,  Gallery  File:Benedetto pistrucci, menade con tirso, sardonice, 1810 ca.JPGalt=Pink and white stone cameo of a woman looking up and to the rightCameo, 1810 File:George III crown MET DP100442.jpgalt=silver coin with St George and the Dragon as the central element1819 crown File:Coronation of George IV MET DP100571.jpgalt=medal of a king, seated on a chair being crowned as figures offer homageCoronation medal for George IV (1821).

There is no official boundary, but it is usually considered to extend from Cassis, Toulon or Saint-Tropez on the west to Menton at the France‚ÄìItaly border in the east, where the Italian Riviera joins.\\"C√¥te d'Azur, c√¥te m√©diterran√©enne fran√ßaise entre Cassis et Menton\\" (\\"C√¥te d'Azur, French Mediterranean coast between Cassis and Toulon\\") in Dictionnaire Hachette encyclop√©dique (2000), p. 448.\\"C√¥te d'Azur, Partie orientale du littoral fran√ßais, sur la M√©diterran√©e, de Cassis √† Menton\\" (\\"C√¥te d'Azur, Eastern part of the French coast, on the Mediterranean, from Cassis to Menton\\"), in Le Petit Larousse illustr√© (2005), p. 1297. The coast is entirely within the Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur region of France. The Principality of Monaco is a semi-enclave within the region, surrounded on three sides by France and fronting the Mediterranean. Riviera is an Italian word that corresponds to the ancient Ligurian territory, wedged between the Var and Magra rivers. The \\"C√¥te d'Azur\\" is a nickname given by St√©phen Li√©geard, a French writer, in his novel La C√¥te d'azur, to describe the coast between Marseilles and Genoa. This coastline was one of the first modern resort areas. It began as a winter health resort for the British upper class at the end of the 18th century. With the arrival of the railway in the mid-19th century, it became the playground and vacation spot of British, Russian, and other aristocrats, such as Queen Victoria, Tsar Alexander II and King Edward VII, when he was Prince of Wales. In the summer, it also played home to many members of the Rothschild family. In the first half of the 20th century, it was frequented by artists and writers, including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Francis Bacon, Edith Wharton, Somerset Maugham and Aldous Huxley, as well as wealthy Americans and Europeans. After World War II, it became a popular tourist destination and convention site. Many celebrities, such as Elton John and Brigitte Bardot, have homes in the region. Officially, the French Riviera is home to 163 nationalities with 83,962 foreign residents,INSEE 1999 census although estimates of the number of non-French nationals living in the area are often much higher.e.g. Comit√© R√©gional du Tourisme Riviera C√¥te d'Azur. Its largest city is Nice, which has a population of 340,017 as of 2017.T√©l√©chargement du fichier d'ensemble des populations l√©gales en 2017, INSEE The city is the centre of a m√©tropole ‚Äì Nice-C√¥te d'Azur ‚Äì bringing together 49 communes and more than 540,000 inhabitants and 943,000 in the urban area. Nice is home to Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport, France's third-busiest airport (after Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport), which is on an area of partially reclaimed coastal land at the western end of the Promenade des Anglais. A second airport at Mandelieu was once the region's commercial airport,Official site: Cannes.aeroport.fr but is now mainly used by private and business aircraft.Official site: Cannes.aeroport.fr The A8 autoroute runs through the region, as does the old main road generally known as the Route nationale 7 (officially now the DN7 in the Var and the D6007 in the Alpes- Maritimes).National 7 website: Nationale7.com High-speed trains serve the coastal region and inland to Grasse, with the TGV Sud-Est service reaching Nice-Ville station in five and a half hours from Paris. The French Riviera has a total population of more than two million. It contains the seaside resorts of Cap-d'Ail, Beaulieu-sur-Mer, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Villefranche-sur-Mer, Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, Cannes, Saint-Rapha√´l, Fr√©jus, Sainte-Maxime and Saint-Tropez.Jim Ring, Riviera, The Rise and Rise of the Cote d'Azur, John Murray Publishers, London, 2004. It is also home to a high tech and science park (French: technopole) at Sophia-Antipolis (north of Antibes) and a research and technology centre at the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis. The region has 35,000 students, of whom 25 percent are working toward a doctorate.Sirius CCINCA. The French Riviera is a major yachting and cruising area with several marinas along its coast. According to the C√¥te d'Azur Economic Development Agency, each year the Riviera hosts 50 percent of the world's superyacht fleet, with 90 percent of all superyachts visiting the region's coast at least once in their lifetime.C√¥te d'Azur Economic Development Agency ‚Äì p.31 CRDP-Nice.net As a tourist centre, the French Riviera benefits from 310 to 330 days of sunshine per year, of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.C√¥te d'Azur Economic Development Agency, op.cit. p.66  Etymology  =Origin of term= View of Port Hercules, Monaco The term French Riviera is typical of English use. It was built by analogy with the term Italian Riviera, which extends east of the French Riviera (from Ventimiglia to La Spezia).In English, \\"Riviera\\" as a whole is defined as \\"the coastal strip along the Mediterranean from La Spezia, Italy, to west of Cannes, France\\". Webster's New World Dictionary of American English, Third College Edition, 1988. As early as the 19th century, the British referred to the region as the Riviera or the French Riviera, usually referring to the eastern part of the coast, between Monaco and the Italian border.For example, J. Henry Bennett, Mentone, the Riviera, Corsica and Biarritz as Winter Climates (1862) Originally, riviera is an Italian noun which means \\"coastline\\". The name C√¥te d'Azur was given to the coast by the writer St√©phen Li√©geard in his book, La C√¥te d‚Äôazur, published in December 1887. Li√©geard was born in Dijon, in the French department of C√¥te-d'Or, and adapted that name by substituting the azure colour of the Mediterranean for the gold of C√¥te-d'Or.Marc Boyer, L'Invention de la C√¥te d'Azur : l'hiver dans le Midi, pr√©face de Maurice Agulhon, 378 pages, √âdition de l'Aube, 2002, . The Old Town district of Menton, which is the last town on the C√¥te d'Azur before the Italian border In Occitan (Ni√ßard and Proven√ßal) and French, the only usual names are C√≤sta d'Azur in Occitan and C√¥te d'Azur in French. A term like \\"French Riviera\\" (Ribiera Francesa in Occitan, Riviera Fran√ßaise in French) would only be used in literal translation, or adaptations of it. For instance, in French, \\"Riviera Fran√ßaise\\" is found in the online Larousse encyclopedia to refer to the holidays of a group of English workers (moreover, in Occitan, the word ribiera \\"coastline\\" mostly works as a common name, whereas in French, the old-fashioned term Rivi√®re de G√™nes was used to refer to the Italian Riviera whose center is Genoa).Harrap's Standard French and English Dictionary, 1948.

Some sources put the western boundary at Saint-Tropez. Others include Saint Tropez, Hy√®res or Toulon in the Var (departement), or as far as Cassis in the Bouches- du-Rh√¥ne departement. In her 1955 novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Patricia Highsmith describes the Riviera as including all of the coast between Toulon and the Italian border.  History  = From prehistory to the Bronze Age = The region of the French Riviera has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Primitive tools dating to between 1,000,000 and 1,050,000 years ago were discovered in the Grotte du Vallonnet, near Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, with stones and bones of animals, including bovines, rhinoceros, and bison. At Terra Amata (380,000 to 230,000 years ago), near the Nice Port, a fireplace was discovered that is one of the oldest found in Europe.Henry de Lumley, La Grande Histoire des premiers hommes europeens, p. 120. Stone dolmens, monuments from the Bronze Age, can be found near Draguignan, while the Valley of Marvels (Vall√©e des Merveilles) near Mount B√©go, at elevation, is presumed to have been an outdoor religious sanctuary, having over 40,000 drawings of people and animals, dated to about 2000 BC.Aldo Basti√©, Histoire de la Provence, Edition Ouest-France, 2001. = Greek influence = Beginning in the 7th century BC, Greek sailors from Phocaea in Asia Minor began to visit and then build emporia along the C√¥te d'Azur. Emporia were started at Olbia (Hy√®res); Antipolis (Antibes) and Nikaia (Nice). These settlements, which traded with the inhabitants of the interior, became rivals of the Etruscans and Phoenicians, who also visited the C√¥te d'Azur. = Roman colonization = In 8 BC the Emperor Augustus built an imposing trophy monument at La Turbie (the Trophy of the Alps or Trophy of Augustus) to mark the pacification of the region. Roman towns, monuments and amphitheatres were built along the C√¥te d'Azur and many still survive, such as the amphitheatre and baths at Cimiez, above Nice, and the amphitheatre, Roman walls and other remains at Fr√©jus. The 5th-century baptistery of Fr√©jus Cathedral, which is still in use = Barbarians and Christians = Roman Provence reached the height of its power and prosperity during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. In the mid-3rd century, Germanic peoples began to invade the region, and Roman power weakened. In the same period, Christianity started to become a powerful force in the region. The first cathedrals were built in the 4th century, and bishoprics were established: in Fr√©jus at the end of the 4th century, Cimiez and Vence in 439, and Antibes in 442. The oldest Christian structure still in existence on the C√¥te d'Azur is the baptistery of Fr√©jus Cathedral, built at the end of the 5th century, which also saw the founding of the first monastery in the region, Lerins Monastery on an island off the coast at Cannes. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the first half of the 5th century was followed by invasions of Provence by the Visigoths, the Burgundians and the Ostrogoths. There was then a long period of wars and dynastic quarrels, which in turn led to further invasions by the Saracens and the Normans in the 9th century. = The Counts of Provence and the House of Grimaldi = Some peace was restored to the coast by the establishment in 879 of a new kingdom of Provence, ruled first by the Bosonids dynasty (879‚Äì1112), then by the Catalans (1112‚Äì1246), and finally by the Angevins (1246‚Äì1382, elder branch, 1382‚Äì1483 (younger branch). Grimaud, near Saint-Tropez In the 13th century, another powerful political force appeared, the House of Grimaldi. Descended from a Genoese nobleman expelled from Genoa by his rivals in 1271, members of the different branches of the Grimaldis took power in Monaco, Antibes and Nice, and built castles at Grimaud, Cagnes-sur-Mer and Antibes. Albert II, the current Prince of Monaco is a descendant of the Grimaldis. In 1388, the city of Nice and its surrounding territory, from the mouth of the Var to the Italian border, were separated from Provence and came under the protection of the House of Savoy. The territory was called the Comt√© de Nice after 1526, and thereafter its language, history and culture were separate from those of Provence until 1860, when it was re-attached to France under Napoleon III. Provence retained its formal independence until 1480, when the last Comte de Provence, Ren√© I of Naples, died and left the Comt√© to his nephew, Charles du Maine, who in turn left it to Louis XI of France. In 1486, Provence formally became part of France. = Popularity with the British upper class in 18th and 19th centuries = Until the end of the 18th century, the area later known as the C√¥te d'Azur was a remote and impoverished region, known mostly for fishing, olive groves and the production of flowers for perfume (manufactured in Grasse). A new phase began when the coast became a fashionable health resort for the British upper class in the late 18th century. The first British traveller to describe its benefits was the novelist Tobias Smollett, who visited Nice in 1763 when it was still an Italian city within the Kingdom of Sardinia. Smollett brought Nice and its warm winter climate to the attention of the British aristocracy with Travels through France and Italy, written in 1765. At about the same time, a Scottish doctor, John Brown, became famous for prescribing what he called climato-therapy, a change in climate, to cure a variety of diseases including tuberculosis, known then as consumption. The French historian Paul Gonnet wrote that, as a result, Nice was filled with \\"a colony of pale and listless English women and listless sons of nobility near death\\". In 1834, a British nobleman and politician named Henry Peter Brougham, First Baron Brougham and Vaux, who had played an important part in the abolition of the slave trade, travelled with an unwell sister to the south of France, intending to go to Italy. A cholera epidemic in Italy forced him to stop at Cannes, where he enjoyed the climate and scenery so much that he bought land and built a villa. He began to spend his winters there and, owing to his fame, others followed: Cannes soon had a small British enclave. Robert Louis Stevenson was a later British visitor who came for his health. In 1882 he rented a villa called La Solitude at Hy√®res, where he wrote much of A Child's Garden of Verses. = Railway, gambling and royalty = The Monte Carlo Casino In 1864, six years after Nice became part of France following the Second Italian War of Independence the first railway was completed, making Nice and the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. One hundred thousand visitors arrived in 1865. By 1874, residents of foreign enclaves in Nice, most of whom were British, numbered 25,000. The Villa Ephrussi in Cap-Saint-Jean-Ferrat, was built in 1905‚Äì1912 by Beatrice de Rothschild, of the Rothschild family. In the mid-19th century British and French entrepreneurs began to see the potential of promoting tourism along the C√¥te d'Azur. At the time, gambling was illegal in France and Italy. In 1856, the Prince of Monaco, Charles III, began constructing a casino in Monaco, which was called a health spa to avoid criticism by the church. The casino was a failure, but in 1863 the Prince signed an agreement with Fran√ßois Blanc, a French businessman already operating a successful casino at Baden-Baden (southwestern Germany), to build a resort and new casino. Blanc arranged for steamships and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, and built hotels, gardens and a casino in a place called Sp√©lugues. At the suggestion of his mother, Princess Caroline, Charles III renamed the place Monte Carlo after himself. When the railway reached Monte Carlo in 1870, many thousands of visitors began to arrive and the population of the principality of Monaco doubled. The French Riviera soon became a popular destination for European royalty. Just days after the railway reached Nice in 1864, Tsar Alexander II of Russia visited on a private train, followed soon afterwards by Napoleon III and then Leopold II, the King of the Belgians. Monument to Queen Victoria in Cimiez, in the hills above Nice, where she was a regular winter visitor. Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor. In 1882 she stayed in Menton, and in 1891 spent several weeks at the Grand Hotel at Grasse. In 1892 she stayed at the Hotel Cost-belle in Hy√®res. In successive years from 1895 to 1899 she stayed in Cimiez in the hills above Nice. First, in 1895 and 1896, she patronised the Grand H√¥tel, while in later years she and her staff took over the entire west wing of the Excelsior H√¥tel R√©gina, which had been designed with her needs specifically in mind (part of which later became the home and studio of the renowned artist Henri Matisse). She travelled with an entourage of between sixty and a hundred, including chef, ladies in waiting, dentist, Indian servants, her own bed and her own food.Michael Nelson, Queen Victoria and the Discovery of the Riviera, Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2007. The Prince of Wales was a regular visitor to Cannes, starting in 1872. He frequented the Club Nautique, a private club on the Croisette, the fashionable seafront boulevard of Cannes. He visited there each spring for a two-month period, observing yacht races from shore while the royal yacht, Britannia, was sailed by professional crewmen. After he became King in 1901, he never again visited the French Riviera. By the end of the 19th century the C√¥te d'Azur began to attract artistic painters, who appreciated the climate, the bright colors and clear light. Among them were Auguste Renoir, who settled in Cagnes-sur-Mer and in Mougins, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. = Inter-war period, American visitors and decline of the aristocracy = The First World War brought down many of the royal houses of Europe and altered the nature and the calendar of the French Riviera. Following the war, greater numbers of Americans began arriving, with business moguls and celebrities eventually outnumbering aristocrats. The 'High Society' scene moved from a winter season to a summer season. Americans began coming to the south of France in the 19th century. Henry James set part of his novel, The Ambassadors, on the Riviera. James Gordon Bennett Jr, the son and heir of the founder of the New York Herald, had a villa in Beaulieu. Industrialist John Pierpont Morgan gambled at Monte Carlo and bought 18th-century paintings by Fragonard in Grasse ‚Äì shipping them to the Metropolitan Museum in New York. A feature of the French Riviera in the inter-war years was the Train Bleu, an all first-class sleeper train which brought wealthy passengers down from Calais. It made its first trip in 1922, and carried Winston Churchill, Somerset Maugham, and the future King Edward VIII over the years. While Europe was still recovering from the war and the American dollar was strong, American writers and artists started arriving on the C√¥te d'Azur. Edith Wharton wrote The Age of Innocence (1920) at a villa near Hy√®res, winning the Pulitzer Prize for the novel (the first woman to do so). Dancer Isadora Duncan frequented Cannes and Nice, but died in 1927 when her scarf caught in a wheel of the Amilcar motor car in which she was a passenger and strangled her. The writer F. Scott Fitzgerald first visited with his wife Zelda in 1924, stopping at Hy√®res, Cannes and Monte Carlo ‚Äì eventually staying at Saint-Rapha√´l, where he wrote much of The Great Gatsby and began Tender is the Night. While Americans were largely responsible for making summer the high season, a French fashion designer, Coco Chanel, made sunbathing fashionable. She acquired a striking tan during the summer of 1923, and tans then became the fashion in Paris. During the abdication crisis of the British Monarchy in 1936, Wallis Simpson, the intended bride of King Edward VIII, was staying at the Villa Lou Viei in Cannes, talking with the King by telephone each day. After his abdication, the Duke of Windsor (as he became) and his new wife stayed at the Villa La Cro√´ on the Cap d'Antibes. The English playwright and novelist Somerset Maugham also became a resident in 1926, buying the Villa La Mauresque toward the tip of Cap Ferrat, near Nice. = Second World War = When Germany invaded France in June 1940, the remaining British colony was evacuated to Gibraltar and eventually to Britain. American Jewish groups helped some of the Jewish artists living in the south of France, such as Marc Chagall, to escape to the United States. In August 1942, 600 Jews from Nice were rounded up by French police and sent to Drancy, and eventually to death camps. In all about 5,000 French Jews from Nice perished during the war. Following D-Day in Normandy, Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil), the code name for the Allied invasion of Southern France, commenced on 15 August 1944, when American parachute troops landed near Fr√©jus, and a fleet landed 60,000 troops of the American Seventh Army and French First Army between Cavalaire and Agay, east of Saint-Rapha√´l. German resistance was not as fanatical as Hitler and the High Command had ordered, and crumbled in days.Hansen, Randall (2014). Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance After Operation Valkyrie, pp. 134-141 Saint-Tropez was badly damaged by German mines at the time of the liberation. The novelist Colette organized an effort to assure the town was rebuilt in its original style. When the war ended, artists Marc Chagall and Pablo Picasso returned to live and work. = Post-war period and late 20th century = The Cannes Film Festival was launched in September 1946, marking the return of French cinema to world screens. The Festival Palace was built in 1949 on the site of the old Cercle Nautique, where the Prince of Wales had met his mistresses in the late 19th century. The release of the French film Et Dieu‚Ä¶ cr√©a la femme (And God Created Woman) in November 1956 was a major event for the Riviera, making an international star of Brigitte Bardot, and making an international tourist destination of Saint-Tropez, particularly for the new class of wealthy international travellers called the jet set. The marriage of American film actress Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier of Monaco on 18 April 1956, attracted world attention once again. It was viewed on television by 30 million people. During the 1960s, the Mayor of Nice, Jacques M√©decin, decided to reduce the dependence of the Riviera on ordinary tourism, and to make it a destination for international congresses and conventions. He built the Palais des Congr√®s at the Acropolis in Nice, and founded a Chagall Museum and a Matisse Museum at Cimiez. High-rise apartment buildings and real estate developments began to spread. At the end of August, 1997, Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed spent their last days together on his father's yacht off Pampelonne Beach near Saint-Tropez, shortly before they were killed in a traffic accident in the Alma Tunnel in Paris.

Winter temperatures are moderated by the Mediterranean; days of frost are rare. The average daily low temperature in Nice in January is ; the January average daily low temperature in Toulon is . The average high temperature in August in Nice is ; in Toulon the average daily high temperature is The C√¥te d'Azur receives more rainfall annually than Paris ( annually in Nice and in Toulon compared with in Paris), but the rainy days are much less frequent; 111 rainy days a year in Paris compared with 61 days in Toulon and 63 in Nice. Toulon has 2,793 hours of sunshine a year, Nice has 2,668 hours. Micro-climates exist in these coastal regions, and there can be great differences in the weather between various locations. Strong winds such as the mistral, a cold dry wind from the northwest or from the east, are another characteristic, particularly in the winter. Nice seen from Spot Satellite  Nice and Alpes-Maritimes  Nice and the Alpes-Maritimes d√©partement are sheltered by the Alps. The winds are usually gentle, from the sea to the land, though sometimes the mistral blows strongly from the northwest, or, turned by the mountains, from the east. In 1956 a mistral from the northwest reached at Nice Airport. Sometimes, in summer, the sirocco brings high temperatures and reddish desert sand from the Sahara (see Winds of Provence). Rain can be torrential, particularly in the autumn, when storms and rain are caused by the difference between the colder air inland and the warm Mediterranean water temperature (). The rainiest months are September ( average rainfall); October (); November () and December (). Snow on the coast is rare, falling on average once every ten years. 1956 was exceptional, when blanketed the coast. In January 1985 the coast between Cannes and Menton received . In the mountains, snow is present from November to May.  Var  The d√©partement of Var (which includes Saint-Tropez and Hy√®res) has a climate slightly warmer, drier and sunnier than Nice and Alpes-Maritimes, but is less sheltered from the wind. The mistral, which brings cold and dry air down from the upper Alpine regions via the Rh√¥ne valley and extends with diminishing intensity along the C√¥te d'Azur, blows frequently during the winter. Strong winds blow for about 75 days a year in Fr√©jus.

In 1917 he settled in Nice, first at the H√¥tel Beau Rivage, then at the H√¥tel de la M√©diterran√©e, then at la Villa des Alli√©s in Cimiez. In 1921 he lived in an apartment in Nice, next to the flower market and overlooking the sea, where he lived until 1938. He then moved to the H√¥tel R√©gina in the hills of Cimiez, above Nice.

Biography Born in Portsmouth, he was the son of William John Madden (1757‚Äì1833), a Captain in the Royal Marines of Irish origin, and his wife Sarah Carter (1759‚Äì1833). From his childhood he displayed a flair for linguistic and antiquarian studies. In 1826 he was engaged by the British Museum to assist in the preparation of the classified catalogue of printed books, and in 1828 he became assistant keeper of manuscripts. In 1832 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At the age of 32 he was made a knight,'St James's Palace, 13 March 1833. The King was this day pleased to confer the honour of Knighthood upon Frederic Madden Esq, of the British Museum, Companion of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order' London Gazette, 1833, p123 https://books.google.com/ Retrieved 12 November 2015 entitling him to the initials KH after his name, and in 1837 he succeeded Josiah Forshall as Keeper of Manuscripts. He did not get on well with his colleagues, and retired in 1866. Madden was the leading palaeographer of his day. However, his ignorance of German prevented his ranking high as a philologist, although he paid much attention to the early dialectical forms of French and English. His minor contributions to antiquarian research were numerous: the best known, perhaps, was his dissertation on the spelling of Shakespeare's name, which, mainly on the strength of a signature found in John Florio's copy of the work of Montaigne, he contended should be \\"Shakspere.\\" This led to a lengthy debate and to a period when the \\"Shakspere\\" spelling nearly became the norm.John Louis Haney, The Name of William Shakespeare: a Study in Orthography, Egerton, 1906, pp. 42‚Äì50. On his death at his home in St Stephen's Square, London, he bequeathed his journals and other private papers to the Bodleian Library, where they were to remain unopened until 1920. Scholarship He edited for the Roxburghe Club Havelok the Dane (1828), discovered by himself among the Laudian manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, William and the Werwolf (1832) and the old English versions of the Gesta Romanorum (1838). In 1839 he edited the ancient metrical romances of Syr Gawayne for the Bannatyne Club, and in 1847 Layamon's Brut, with a prose translation, for the Society of Antiquaries. In 1850 the magnificent edition, in parallel columns, of what are known as the \\"Wycliffite\\" versions of the Bible, from the original manuscripts, upon which he and his coadjutor, Forshall, had been engaged for twenty years, was published by the University of Oxford. In 1866‚Äì69 he edited the Historia Minor of Matthew Paris for the Rolls Series. In 1833 he wrote the text of Henry Shaw's Illuminated Ornaments of the Middle Ages; and in 1850 he edited the English translation of Joseph Balthazar Silvestre's Pal√©ographie universelle. He was one of the three contributors to Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica.  Conservation  In April 1837, when still the Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts, Madden was shown a garret of the old museum building which contained a large number of burnt and damaged fragments and codices of vellum manuscripts. Madden immediately identified them as part of the Cotton library collection, which had been badly damaged in a fire of 1731. During his tenure as Keeper of Manuscripts, Madden undertook extensive conservation work on the Cotton manuscripts (often in the face of opposition from the Museum's board, who deemed the enterprise prohibitively expensive). In collaboration with the bookbinder Henry Gough, he developed a conservation strategy that restored even the most badly damaged fragments and manuscripts to a usable state. Vellum sheets were cleaned and flattened and mounted in paper frames. Where possible, they were rebound in their original codices. As well as the fragments found in the garret, he carried out conservation work on the rest of the collection. Many manuscripts had become brittle and fragile, including the codex that contains the only known copy of Beowulf (Cotton Vittelius A xv). By 1845, the work was largely complete, though Madden was to suffer one more setback when a fire broke out in the Museum bindery, destroying completely some further works from the collection.Andrew Prescott, Their Present Miserable State of Cremation: the Restoration of the Cotton Library, 1997 Family In the summer of 1837 in the district of Edmonton, then in Middlesex,\\"England and Wales Marriage Registration Index, 1837‚Äì2005,\\" FamilySearch https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2DWR-9YL Emily Sarah Robinson, 1837; from \\"England & Wales Marriages, 1837‚Äì2005\\", database, findmypast http://www.findmypast.com/ Marriage, Edmonton, Middlesex, England, General Register Office, Southport, England.

Gabriel Monod (7 March 1844 ‚Äì 10 April 1912) was a French historian, the nephew of Adolphe Monod. Biography Born in Ingouville, Seine-Maritime, he was educated at Le Havre then went to Paris to complete his education, lodging with the de Pressens√© family. The influence of Edmond de Pressens√©, a pastor and large-minded theologian, and of Madame de Pressens√©, a woman of superior intellect and refined feeling, who devoted her life to educational works and charity, made a great impression on him. In 1865 he left the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, and went to Germany, where he studied at the University of G√∂ttingen and Humboldt University in Berlin. The teaching of Georg Waitz definitely directed his studies towards the history of the Middle Ages. Returning to France in 1868 he was nominated by Victor Duruy to give lectures on history, following the method used in German seminaries, at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out, Gabriel Monod, with his cousins Alfred and Sarah Monod, organized an ambulance with which he followed the whole campaign, from Sedan to Le Mans. He wrote a small book of memoirs of this campaign, Allemands et Fran√ßais (1871), in which he spoke of the conquerors without bitterness; this attitude was all the more praiseworthy as his mother was originally from Alsace, and he was unable to resign himself to the loss of Alsace and Lorraine.

He himself said that his pupils were his best books; he intended to teach them not so much new facts as the way to study, endeavouring to develop in them an idea of criticism and truth. They showed their gratitude by dedicating a book to him in 1896, √âtudes d'histoire du moyen √¢ge, and after his retirement in 1905 by having his features engraved on a slab (see √Ä Gabriel Monod, en souvenir de son enseignement: √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, 1868‚Äì1905, √âcole normale sup√©rieure, 1880-1904. 26 May 1907).

Author of Commentaire sur l'√âp√Ætre aux Romains, On the Inspiration of Scripture and Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans. Early life  Robert Haldane 3rd of Airthrey was the son of James Haldane 2nd of Airthrey, and his wife, Katherine Duncan. Robert was born on 28 February 1764 in Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square in London. Robert and his younger brother James Alexander Haldane were raised by their grandmother Lady Lundie and uncles. Robert and James attended classes at Dundee Grammar School, the Royal High School in Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1780 Robert joined HMS Monarch as an officer, of which his maternal uncle, Adam Duncan, was in command. In 1781, he was transferred to HMS Foudroyant. He was on HMS Foudroyant under John Jervis during the night engagement in April 1782 with the French ship Pegase and greatly distinguished himself. Haldane was afterwards present at the relief of Gibraltar in September 1782. Some months later after the peace treaty of 1783, he left the Royal Navy.  Airthrey Estate  Airthrey Castle from the south-west in 1829, showing the Robert Adam design Airthrey Castle, Airthrey Estate, north facade Soon after leaving the Navy, he settled on his family estate Airthrey, near Stirling where he contacted the Whites of Durham to landscape the grounds. These estate improvements included the creation of a man-made loch, rolling lawns, several wooded plantations, a hermitage and a boundary wall which is nearly four miles in length. In 1790 he commissioned the neoclassical architect Robert Adam to make a draft for the building of Airthrey Castle of which Adam created two designs. Haldane picked his favourite design but chose to have Thomas Russell complete the works instead of Robert Adam. Airthrey Castle was completed in 1791 and as built corresponded largely to the final design by Robert Adam without the forecourt which was never built. Although there were changes to the north facade in the late nineteenth century, the south facade is still essentially as designed by Adam. Evangelism Robert's tutor was David Bogue of Gosport. After reading about the start of the French Revolution he grew to disapprove strongly of the war with France. Robert resolved to devote himself to advancing Christianity. In 1795 Robert converted to the evangelical church shortly after his brother James converted. Robert became one of the first members of the London Missionary Society in 1795, the same year that he was converted. He offered the British Government and the East India Company to sell Airthrey Estate in order to set up a vast mission in Bengal but was turned down by the East India Company, and the mission was abandoned. In December 1797 he also joined his brother and some others in the formation of the \\"Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at Home,\\" in building chapels or \\"tabernacles\\" for congregations, in supporting missionaries, and in maintaining institutions for the education of young men to carry on the work of evangelization. In 1798 he sold the Airthrey Estate to Robert Abercromby to obtain funding for his mission work and with the funds raised to set up the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home in Edinburgh. In 1799 Robert organised for Plean Estate to be sold and this was bought in 1800 by Francis Simpson. George Whitefield's Tabernacle, Moorfields Over the next twelve years (1798‚Äì1810) he gave over ¬£70,000 pounds; this was used to further the cause of the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home by building chapels for congregations, supporting missionaries and helping to maintain institutions for young men to be educated to carry on the work of evangelization. Robert was inspired by George Whitefield's two tabernacles in London and built preaching centres strategically placed throughout Scotland. These tabernacles were located in Glasgow, Dundee, Perth, Thurso, Wick, Edinburgh and Elgin. His brother James took over the Edinburgh tabernacle until 1851. Robert funded John Campbell's Society for the Education of Africans which initially planned to evangelise in Africa by bringing over native children to be trained as Christian missionaries in Edinburgh. However, owing to an outbreak of smallpox, the group of children remained in the London area at what became known as the African Academy in Clapham. From 1799 to 1807, Robert set up theological seminars in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee to train young men with a passion for the gospel. Young men would come and train for 2‚Äì3 years with all their expenses paid for. Over this time 300 men were trained and sent out to spread their teachings all over the world. In 1816 Robert published a work on the Evidences and Authority of Divine Revelation. In the summer of 1816 Robert Haldane visited Europe, first at Geneva and afterwards in Montauban. He lectured and interviewed large numbers of theological students with remarkable effect; among them were C√©sar Malan, Fr√©d√©ric Monod and Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubign√©. This circle of men spread the revival of evangelical Protestant Christianity across the continent of Europe (Le R√©veil), impacting France, Germany (Die Erweckung) and the Netherlands (Het Reveil). Through conversion and missionary impetus the effects of this revival were felt as far afield as Italy and Hungary.  Later life  In 1819, Robert had his theological prelections published in a Commentaire sur l'√âp√Ætre aux Romains. He returned to Scotland in 1819 to live partly at the estate he had bought in 1809, Auchengray and partly in Edinburgh at 10 Duke Street Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1830-31 (later renamed Dublin Street). Like his brother James, he took part in many of the religious controversies of the time, mainly through correspondence in the newspapers. Robert's later writing included a number of pamphlets on the Apocrypha controversy, as well as a treatise On the Inspiration of Scripture which was published in 1828 and a later Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans published in 1835, which has been translated into French and German. Robert died on 12 December in 1842 in Edinburgh and was buried in Glasgow Cathedral.

It starred two comedy double acts, one being David Baddiel and Rob Newman, the other Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. All four comedians had graduated from Cambridge University. It was broadcast on both radio and television in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The show was named after Mary Whitehouse, a campaigner against what she saw as a decline in television standards and public morality. She became the target of mockery in the UK for her attitudes. The BBC feared Whitehouse would initiate litigation for the use of her name in the show's title, and for a period the alternative title The William Rees-Mogg Experience was considered. BBC Radio One show A radio pilot was broadcast on 10 March 1989 on BBC Radio 1 and a series of 13 shows began on 7 April the same year.The Mary Whitehouse Experience epguides.com The format was devised by Bill Dare. The two pairings of Newman and Baddiel and Punt and Dennis were central to the show, with support from Nick Hancock, Jo Brand, Jack Dee, Mark Thomas and Mark Hurst. The show also included musical interludes from Skint Video and The Tracy Brothers. It was originally aired at midnight on Friday. It was subsequently moved to a 10:30pm slot, before being moved again for its fourth and final series to 7pm on Saturday evenings. The show ran for four series and a special (44 episodes in total) from March 1989 to December 1990. In the episode originally broadcast on 17 March 1990, there was a brief reference to Robert Newman losing his virginity to a music teacher, a Mr Clulow, in detention. This is widely thought to be a reference to Peter Clulow, a former music teacher at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School (where David Baddiel was a pupil) who left the school in the mid-1980s following allegations concerning indecent approaches to the boys. Clulow was subsequently convicted and imprisoned on charges of indecent assault and one count of causing a child to engage in sexual activity. Television A television pilot aired on BBC2 shortly before the fourth and final radio series, on 3 October 1990. The first series started on 3 January 1991 and ran for six episodes, with a second set of six episodes in 1992. The television series was a mix of observational comedy sketches and monologues, in a format similar to shows such as Mr. Show and The Kids in the Hall. The show featured a lot of satirical takes on famous people, films and TV shows of the day along with original character material. Each show was made up of sections usually headed by a caption related to the topic about to be discussed. The caption took the form of 'The [topic] Experience'. One of the performers would begin talking about the topic in monologue form, sometimes with input from another performer who appeared in character. The monologue would make reference to a humorous scenario which would be played out in sketch form, returning either to the same topic or moving on to a different or loosely related one. Lines or characters from sketches might recur throughout the show either as a continuation of the original sketch or an invasion of another one. The pace of the show was fairly rapid, helped by the inclusion of a boom camera in the studio which panned quickly around the audience and back to the stage at the beginning of each monologue. Each section was punctuated with a small excerpt of the theme music, Jack to the Sound of the Underground. In 1991 a companion book to the series was released called The Mary Whitehouse Experience Encyclopedia, with references to some of the sketches featured on the show and much new additional material.David Baddiel, Hugh Dennis, Robert Newman, and Steve Punt. The Mary Whitehouse Experience Encyclopedia (London : Fourth Estate, 1991). (10). (13). (Series companion book.) Recurring characters =Ray= (played by Rob Newman) A man afflicted with a disease that gives him a permanently sarcastic tone of voice, so that everything he says comes out sounding sarcastic, no matter how sincerely he means it. This sketch is presented as a medical case history told by Ray's psychiatrist (played by David Baddiel), who gives accounts of various situations in which Ray's affliction has got him into trouble. These are usually sensitive situations such as speaking out at a funeral, apologising to an old man after running over his wife in his car, and complimenting a suicidal child on his drawings. At other times Ray has experienced near-fatal accidents, such as having an arrow shot through his brain, which are ignored by passers-by given that even his cries of pain sound sarcastic. Ray's disorder also affects his body language, as demonstrated in one sketch in which he converses with his deaf foster mother. Ray's psychiatrist discovers that the only things Ray's voice can say normally are those that he means sarcastically. In one sketch he makes friends with some media types, who appreciate his seemingly endless sarcasm when talking about the film Edward Scissorhands. In the final episode, on being given a Cure album as a present, Ray cannot bring himself to sound sarcastic when thanking his friend and, bizarrely, starts speaking Flemish. Ray has quite a successful run of appearances on Flemish chat-shows, before the inevitable happens, and he begins speaking Flemish in a sarcastic tone. Ray often uses the phrase \\"Oh no, what a personal disaster\\" which became one of the show's most popular catchphrases. =Ivan= (played by Rob Newman) Ivan is a daytime television presenter who hosts a show similar to the BBC's Pebble Mill at One. His appearance became increasingly unusual as the sketches progressed (his hair ends up extremely ruffled and he has plasters on his face), however he appears at first glance to be like any normal daytime TV presenter. But Ivan is very overemotional and will fly into a tormented rage at the slightest mention of anything vaguely bad. One such example is when a professional gardener he is interviewing tells him in passing that someone has trodden on and broken a garden cane he was going to use, and Ivan proceeds to fly into a hysterical rage and smash apart the whole greenhouse. Likewise, when informed that the situation is not so bad after all, Ivan will similarly react in an overly ecstatic manner, much to the annoyance of his guests. =Mr. Strange= (played by Hugh Dennis, better known as the 'Milky Milky' sketch) Mr. Strange is the archetypal 'man your mother warned you about', the weird man who walks around town in a dirty old mac, indulging in disturbingly eccentric behaviour. Mr. Strange's main trait is that he has an absurd addiction to off milk, and is always carrying cartons or bottles of milk with him, not only drinking from them but obsessively sniffing them before uttering the words \\"Lovely‚ÄîMilky Milky\\" (which became another one of the show's most popular catchphrases). This led to a 1992 novelty tie-in single \\"Milky Milky (Take Me to the Fridge)\\" by Mr Strange and the Lactose Brotherhood, as well as Punt and Dennis' tour of the same year being named \\"The Milky Milky Tour\\". One sketch features Mr. Strange as a contestant on Mastermind whose specialist subject is 'Milk and the way it smells' while another features him presenting a Party political broadcast offering himself as an alternative to the main political leaders because \\"I don't wash my pants‚Äîit's not nature's way\\". =History Today= History Today made its debut in the second half of the show's second TV series. History Today is an historical discussion programme presented by two elderly, scholarly professors, both well-spoken and well- groomed. The first of these professors, who introduces each 'episode' and its topic of discussion, is played by David Baddiel although the character is never named. The second is Professor F. J. Lewis, Emeritus Professor of History at All Souls College, Oxford, who is played by Rob Newman. Each 'episode' begins as a standard historical debate, but quickly degenerates into a playground-style quarrel with the professors exchanging childish insults. The humour lies largely in the juxtaposition of the professors' formal tone of voice with their puerile words. This sketch spawned perhaps the show's most popular catchphrase \\"...That's you, that is\\", spoken after they had described someone/something supposedly pathetic and/or disgusting. This sketch was later carried over into Newman and Baddiel's own show, Newman and Baddiel in Pieces. Parodies Robert Smith (played by Rob Newman) A parody of the singer Robert Smith, front-man with the British rock band The Cure. This was prompted by Baddiel's observation that, although the band's earlier material had been recorded in a downbeat, 'doom and gloom' Gothic rock style, they had later moved in a more poppy direction (with singles such as \\"Friday I'm in Love\\"). Each sketch features Robert Smith and The Cure performing a particularly happy, cheery song or nursery rhyme in the band's goth style. The songs included \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport\\" (originally by Rolf Harris), \\"The Laughing Policeman\\" and Tommy Steele's \\"Flash Bang Wallop\\". Robert Smith himself also made a guest appearance on the final episode of the show, in the last of the 'Ray' sketches, in which he was seen to sing \\"The Sun Has Got His Hat On\\". Edward Colanderhands (played by Rob Newman) A parody of the Tim Burton film Edward Scissorhands, which featured a similar character but with colanders for hands instead of scissors. He was seen in a sketch helping a housewife to drain vegetables. He was also present in the Robert Smith sketch as an audience member clapping to the beat of the songs, instead of clapping his hands he clapped his colanders together and unlike the rest of the audience he showed immense enjoyment of the performance. He later returned as \\"Edward 'Good Movie Guide' Knob\\". Mark and Tim A parody of Mark Gardener and Tim Burgess. Rob Newman admits to growing his hair to look like Mark Gardener and Tim Burgess, out of respective bands Ride and The Charlatans, and while praising their musical accomplishments he demonstrates why you wouldn't want to 'hang out with them' in several scenarios. These include playing football, helping to check if Rob's car brake lights are working and as backup while Rob is being held at knife point. In each event both Tim and Mark remain silent and motionless apart from moving their head slowly from side to side. Repeats The majority of the first three radio series were repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2003. However, rights issues precluded further transmissions, although there have been very occasional one-off airings in the Saturday morning Comedy Controller slot. A run of selected episodes started on Friday nights in September 2013. Although there were edited compilation repeats of the television series on the BBC within a year of the original broadcasts, it has never been released on home video.

Life He was born at Hallydown Farm, in the parish of Coldingham, Berwickshire, Scotland, the son of John Bogue, farmer, and his wife, Margaret Swanston. He received his early education in Eyemouth.. After studying Divinity at Edinburgh University, he was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland, but, failing to find a patron, made his way to London in 1771, to teach in schools at Edmonton, Hampstead and then Mansion House Cottage in Camberwell. In 1777, he settled as minister of the independent Congregational church at Gosport in Hampshire. His predecessors at the Independent Chapel of Gosport were the Rev. James Watson (1770‚Äì76) and the Rev. Thomas Williams (1750‚Äì70). In 1771 he established an institution for preparing men for the ministry. It was the age of the new-born missionary enterprise, and Bogue's academy was largely the seed from which the London Missionary Society grew. In 1800 the society placed missionaries with Bogue for preparation for their ministries. Bogue himself would have gone to India in 1796 if not for the opposition of the East India Company. In 1824 he taught Samuel Dyer at Gosport before he left for Penang as a missionary with the London Missionary Society. He was also involved in founding the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Religious Tract Society, and in conjunction with James Bennett, minister at Romsey, wrote a well-known History of Dissenters (3 vols., 1809). Another of his writings was an Essay on the Divine Authority of the New Testament. In 1815 Yale University awarded him a doctor of divinity (DD). He died on 25 October 1825 in Brighton during the London Missionary Society's annual tour.

Life Table Mountain (Cape Town). Drawing by Solomon Malan (1839), now at Sasol Art Museum Stellenbosch By birth a Genevan descended from an exiled French family, Malan was born in Geneva, where his father, Dr Henri Abraham C√©sar Malan (1787‚Äì1864) enjoyed a great reputation as a Protestant divine. From his earliest youth he manifested a remarkable faculty for the study of languages, and when he came to Scotland as tutor in the marquis of Tweeddale's family at the age of 18 he had already made progress in Sanskrit, Arabic and Hebrew. In 1833 he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford; and English being almost an unknown tongue to him, he petitioned the examiners to allow him to do his paper work of the examination in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin or Greek, rather than in English. But his request was not granted. After gaining the Boden and the Pusey and Ellerton scholarships, he graduated 2nd class in Literae humaniores in 1837. He then proceeded to India as classical lecturer at Bishop's College, Calcutta, to which post he added the duties of secretary to the Bengal branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; and although compelled by illness to return in 1840, laid the foundation of a knowledge of Tibetan and Chinese. After serving various curacies, he was presented in 1845 to the living of Broadwindsor, Dorset, which he held until 1886 During this entire period he continued to augment his linguistic knowledge; he was able to preach in Georgian, on a visit which he paid to Nineveh in 1872. His translations from the Armenian, Georgian and Coptic were numerous. He applied his Chinese learning to the determination of important points connected with Chinese religion, and published a vast number of parallel passages illustrative of the Book of Proverbs. In 1880 the University of Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.D. No modern scholar, perhaps, has so nearly approached the linguistic omniscience of Mezzofanti;E. H. Blakeney, \\"The Greatest Linguist\\", The Observer, 15 December 1929, p. 9. but, like Mezzofanti, Dr Malan was more of a linguist than a critic. He made himself conspicuous by the vehemence of his opposition to Westcott and Hort's text of the New Testament, and to the transliteration of Oriental languages, on neither of which points did he have the general support of scholars. His extensive and valuable library, some special collections excepted, was presented by him in his lifetime to the Indian Institute at Oxford. He died at Bournemouth.

Cutting fluid is a type of coolant and lubricant designed specifically for metalworking processes, such as machining and stamping. There are various kinds of cutting fluids, which include oils, oil-water emulsions, pastes, gels, aerosols (mists), and air or other gases. Cutting fluid are made from petroleum distillates, animal fats, plant oils, water and air, or other raw ingredients. Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as cutting fluid, cutting oil, cutting compound, coolant, or lubricant. Most metalworking and machining processes can benefit from the use of cutting fluid, depending on workpiece material. Common exceptions to this are cast iron and brass, which may be machined dry (though this is not true of all brasses, and any machining of brass will likely benefit from the presence of a cutting fluid). The properties that are sought after in a good cutting fluid are the ability to: * keep the workpiece at a stable temperature (critical when working to close tolerances). Very warm is acceptable, but extremely hot or alternating hot-and-cold are avoided. * maximize the life of the cutting tip by lubricating the working edge and reducing tip welding. * ensure safety for the people handling it (toxicity, bacteria, fungi) and for the environment upon disposal. * prevent rust on machine parts and cutters. Function = Cooling = Metal cutting generates heat due to friction and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low thermal conductivity (conducts heat poorly) meaning it is a poor coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy cutting over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce friction and tool wear. However, it is not just the tool which heats up but also the work surface. Excessive temperature in the tool or work surface can ruin the temper of both, soften either to the point of uselessness or failure, burn adjacent material, create unwanted thermal expansion or lead to unwanted chemical reactions such as oxidation. = Lubrication = Besides cooling, cutting fluids also aid the cutting process by lubricating the interface between the tool's cutting edge and the chip. By preventing friction at this interface, some of the heat generation is prevented. This lubrication also helps prevent the chips from being welded onto the tool, which would interfere with subsequent cutting. Extreme pressure additives are often added to cutting fluids to further reduce tool wear.  Delivery methods  Every conceivable method of applying cutting fluid (e.g., flooding, spraying, dripping, misting, brushing) can be used, with the best choice depending on the application and the equipment available. For many metal cutting applications the ideal has long been high-pressure, high-volume pumping to force a stream of liquid (usually an oil-water emulsion) directly into the tool-chip interface, with walls around the machine to contain the splatter and a sump to catch, filter, and recirculate the fluid. This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used. Fortunately it is also not necessary in those applications, where heavy cuts, aggressive speeds and feeds, and constant, all-day cutting are not vital. As technology continually advances, the flooding paradigm is no longer always the clear winner. It has been complemented since the 2000s by new permutations of liquid, aerosol, and gas delivery, such as minimum quantity lubrication and through-the-tool-tip cryogenic cooling (detailed below). Through-tool coolant systems, also known as through-spindle coolant systems, are systems plumbed to deliver coolant through passages inside the spindle and through the tool, directly to the cutting interface. Many of these are also high-pressure coolant systems, in which the operating pressure can be hundreds to several thousand psi (1 to 30 MPa)‚Äîpressures comparable to those used in hydraulic circuits. High-pressure through-spindle coolant systems require rotary unions that can withstand these pressures. Drill bits and endmills tailored for this use have small holes at the lips where the coolant shoots out. Various types of gun drills also use similar arrangements. Types = Liquids = There are generally three types of liquids: mineral, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Semi-synthetic and synthetic cutting fluids represent attempts to combine the best properties of oil with the best properties of water by suspending emulsified oil in a water base. These properties include: rust inhibition, tolerance of a wide range of water hardness (maintaining pH stability around 9 to 10), ability to work with many metals, resist thermal breakdown, and environmental safety.OSHA (1999). Metalworking Fluids: Safety and Health Best Practices Manual. Salt Lake City: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Water is a good conductor of heat but has drawbacks as a cutting fluid. It boils easily, promotes rusting of machine parts, and does not lubricate well. Therefore, other ingredients are necessary to create an optimal cutting fluid. Mineral oils, which are petroleum-based, first saw use in cutting applications in the late 19th century. These vary from the thick, dark, sulfur-rich cutting oils used in heavy industry to light, clear oils. Semi-synthetic coolants, also called soluble oil, are an emulsion or microemulsion of water with mineral oil. In workshops using British English soluble oil is colloquially known as SUDS. These began to see use in the 1930s. A typical CNC machine tool usually uses emulsified coolant, which consists of a small amount of oil emulsified into a larger amount of water through the use of a detergent. Synthetic coolants originated in the late 1950s and are usually water-based. The official technique to measure oil concentration in cutting fluid samples is manual titration: 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and the volume of titrant used to reach the endpoint is used to calculate the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held refractometer is the industrial standard used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the Brix scale. The refractometer allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in cutting fluids, such as measure of the fluid viscosity, density, and ultrasound speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity. Others include: * Kerosene and rubbing alcohol often give good results when working on aluminum. * WD-40 and 3-In-One Oil work well on various metals. The latter has a citronella odor; if the odor offends, mineral oil and general-purpose lubricating oils work about the same. * Way oil (the oil made for machine tool ways) works as a cutting oil. In fact, some screw machines are designed to use one oil as both the way oil and cutting oil. (Most machine tools treat way lube and coolant as separate things that inevitably mix during use, which leads to tramp oil skimmers being used to separate them back out.) * Motor oils have a slightly complicated relationship to machine tools. Straight-weight non-detergent motor oils are usable, and in fact SAE 10 and 20 oils used to be the recommended spindle and way oils (respectively) on manual machine tools decades ago, although nowadays dedicated way oil formulas prevail in commercial machining. While nearly all motor oils can act as adequate cutting fluids in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight motor oils with detergents and other additives are best avoided. These additives can present a copper-corrosion concern to brass and bronze, which machine tools often have in their bearings and leadscrew nuts (especially older or manual machine tools). * Dielectric fluid is used as a cutting fluid in electrical discharge machines (EDMs). It is usually deionized water or a high-flash-point kerosene. Intense heat is generated by the cutting action of the electrode (or wire) and the fluid is used to stabilize the temperature of the workpiece, along with flushing any eroded particles from the immediate work area. The dielectric fluid is non- conductive. * Liquid- (water- or petroleum oil-) cooled water tables are used with the plasma arc cutting (PAC) process. * Neatsfoot oil of the highest grade is used as a lubricant. It is used in metalworking industries as a cutting fluid for aluminum. For machining, tapping and drilling aluminum, it is superior to kerosene and various water-based cutting fluids. = Pastes or gels = Cutting fluid may also take the form of a paste or gel when used for some applications, in particular hand operations such as drilling and tapping. In sawing metal with a bandsaw, it is common to periodically run a stick of paste against the blade. This product is similar in form factor to lipstick or beeswax. It comes in a cardboard tube, which gets slowly consumed with each application. = Aerosols (mists) = Some cutting fluids are used in aerosol (mist) form (air with tiny droplets of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don't even work very well. Both of those problems come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere and all the time except at the cutting interface, during the cut‚Äîthe one place and time where it's wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, (minimum quantity of lubricant), avoids both of those problems. The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the insert itself‚Äîan ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as gun drilling or expensive, state-of-the-art liquid delivery in production milling). MQL's aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators' perspective. The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is so clean that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before. MQL doesn't provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success. = CO2 Coolant = Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is also used as a coolant. In this application pressurized liquid CO2 is allowed to expand and this is accompanied by a drop in temperature, enough to cause a change of phase into a solid. These solid crystals are redirected into the cut zone by either external nozzles or through-the-spindle delivery, to provide temperature controlled cooling of the cutting tool and work piece. = Air or other gases (e.g., nitrogen) = Ambient air, of course, was the original machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net result is that the heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, described above). Liquid nitrogen, supplied in pressurized steel bottles, is sometimes used in similar fashion. In this case, boiling is enough to provide a powerful refrigerating effect. For years this has been done (in limited applications) by flooding the work zone. Since 2005, this mode of coolant has been applied in a manner comparable to MQL (with through-the- spindle and through-the-tool-tip delivery). This refrigerates the body and tips of the tool to such a degree that it acts as a \\"thermal sponge\\", sucking up the heat from the tool‚Äìchip interface. This new type of nitrogen cooling is still under patent. Tool life has been increased by a factor of 10 in the milling of tough metals such as titanium and inconel. Alternatively, using airflow combined with a quick evaporating substance (ex. alcohol, water etc.) can be used as an effective coolant when handling hot pieces that cannot be cooled by alternate methods. = Past practice = * In 19th-century machining practice, it was not uncommon to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge‚Äìchip interface. When one considers that high- speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available. * Animal fats such as Tallow or Lard were very popular in the past., pp. 153‚Äì155. These are used infrequently today, because of the wide variety of other choices, but remain as an option. * Old machine shop training texts speak of using red lead and white lead, often mixed into lard or lard oil. This practice is obsolete due to the toxicity of lead. * From the mid-20th century to the 1990s, 1,1,1-trichloroethane was used as an additive to make some cutting fluids more effective. In shop-floor slang it was referred to as \\"one-one-one\\". It has been phased out because of its ozone- depleting and central nervous system-depressing properties. Safety concerns Cutting fluids present some mechanisms for causing illness or injury in workers.NIOSH (2007). Health hazard evaluation and technical assistance report: HETA 005-0227-3049, Diamond Chain Company, Indianapolis, Indiana. Occupational exposure is associated with increases in cardiovascular disease. These mechanisms are based on the external (skin) or internal contact involved in machining work, including touching the parts and tooling; being splattered or splashed by the fluid; or having mist settle on the skin or enter the mouth and nose in the normal course of breathing. The mechanisms include the chemical toxicity or physical irritating ability of: * the fluid itself * the metal particles (from previous cutting) that are borne in the fluid * the bacterial or fungal populations that naturally tend to grow in the fluid over time * the biocides that are added to inhibit those life forms * the corrosion inhibitors that are added to protect the machine and tooling * the tramp oils that result from the way oils (the lubricants for the slideways) inevitably finding their way into the coolant The toxicity or irritating ability is usually not high, but it is sometimes enough to cause problems for the skin or for the tissues of the respiratory tract or alimentary tract (e.g., the mouth, larynx, esophagus, trachea, or lungs). Some of the diagnoses that can result from the mechanisms explained above include irritant contact dermatitis; allergic contact dermatitis; occupational acne; tracheitis; esophagitis; bronchitis; asthma; allergy; hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP); and worsening of pre-existing respiratory problems. Safer cutting fluid formulations provide a resistance to tramp oils, allowing improved filtration separation without removing the base additive package. Room ventilation, splash guards on machines, and personal protective equipment (PPE) (such as safety glasses, respirator masks, and gloves) can mitigate hazards related to cutting fluids.NIOSH (1998). Criteria for a recommended standard: occupational exposure to metalworking fluids. Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. DHHS (NIOSH) Pub. No. 98-102. Additionally, Skimmers may be used to remove tramp oil from the surface of cutting fluid, which prevents the growth of micro- organisms. Bacterial growth is predominant in petroleum-based cutting fluids. Tramp oil along with human hair or skin oil are some of the debris during cutting which accumulates and forms a layer on the top of the liquid; anaerobic bacteria proliferate due to a number of factors. An early sign of the need for replacement is the \\"Monday-morning smell\\" (due to lack of usage from Friday to Monday). Antiseptics are sometimes added to the fluid to kill bacteria. Such use must be balanced against whether the antiseptics will harm the cutting performance, workers' health, or the environment. Maintaining as low a fluid temperature as practical will slow the growth of microorganisms. Degradation, replacement, and disposal Cutting fluids degrade over time due to contaminants entering the lubrication system. A common type of degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid.. It originates as lubrication oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases it can be seen as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil. Skimmers are used to separate the tramp oil from the coolant. These are typically slowly rotating vertical discs that are partially submerged below the coolant level in the main reservoir. As the disc rotates the tramp oil clings to each side of the disc to be scraped off by two wipers, before the disc passes back through the coolant. The wipers are in the form of a channel that then redirects the tramp oil to a container where it is collected for disposal. Floating weir skimmers are also used in these situation where temperature or the amount of oil on the water becomes excessive. Since the introduction of CNC additives, the tramp oil in these systems can be managed more effectively through a continuous separation effect. The tramp oil accumulation separates from the aqueous or oil based coolant and can be easily removed with an absorbent. Old, used cutting fluid must be disposed of when it is fetid or chemically degraded and has lost its usefulness. As with used motor oil or other wastes, its impact on the environment should be mitigated. Legislation and regulation specify how this mitigation should be achieved. Modern cutting fluid disposal involves techniques such as ultrafiltration using polymeric or ceramic membranes which concentrates the suspended and emulsified oil phase. Chip handling and coolant management are interrelated. Over the decades they have been improved, to the point that many metalworking operations now use engineered solutions for the overall cycle of collecting, separating, and recycling both chips and coolant. For example, the chips are graded by size and type, tramp metals (such as bolts and scrap parts) are separated out, the coolant is centrifuged off the chips (which are then dried for further handling), and so on.

Life  Born to humble parents in Bologna, he showed exceptional mnemonic skills as well as a flair for music and foreign language learning from a very young age. He studied at the Piarists where he had the chance to meet several missionaries from various countries. By speaking with them he began learning several new languages including Swedish, German, Spanish and Southern American native languages as well as studying Latin and ancient Greek in school. He completed his theological studies before he had reached the minimum age for ordination as a priest. During this period he also studied Asian Languages; in 1797 he was ordained a priest and became professor of Arabic, Hebrew, Asian Languages and Greek at the University of Bologna. In 1797, an English couple Georgiana Hare- Naylor and her husband had to return home. They left three of their children in the care of Professor Clotilda Tambroni and a Spanish priest, and they appointed Mezzofanti tutor to their eldest son. This was thought an odd decision but Georgiana took her own council and her eldest later attributed his love of learning with the time he spent that year. Mezzofanti (and Tambroni) later lost the university position for refusing to take the oath of allegiance required by the Cisalpine Republic, which governed Bologna at the time. Between 1799 and 1800 he visited many foreign people who had been wounded during the Napoleonic wars to attend to their cures and he started to learn other European languages. In 1803 he was appointed assistant librarian of the Institute of Bologna, and soon afterwards was reinstated as professor of Oriental languages and of Greek. The chair of Oriental languages was suppressed by the viceroy in 1808, but again rehabilitated on the restoration of Pope Pius VII in 1814. Mezzofanti held this post until he left Bologna to go to Rome in 1831 as a member of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Congregatio de Propaganda Fide), the Catholic Church's governing body for missionary activities. In 1833, he succeeded Angelo Mai as Custodian-in- Chief of the Vatican Library, and in 1838 was made cardinal of the title of St. Onofrio al Gianicolo and director of studies in the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. His other diverse interests included ethnology, archaeology, numismatics, and astronomy. List of languages spoken Mezzofanti was well known for being a hyperpolyglot who, according to (Russell 1858), spoke at least thirty languages \\"with rare excellence\\": He was reported to have spoken nine other languages fluently, and with dozens of others he is said to have had at least basic knowledge. The precise number of languages known to Mezzofanti is rather uncertain, naturally so because of the relativity of the concept of \\"knowing\\" a language. (Russell 1858) gives a list of 114 items he received from Mezzofanti's nephew (pp. 463-465). Apart from the thirty languages \\"frequently tested, and spoken with rare excellence\\", Russell lists another nine \\"spoken fluently, but hardly sufficiently tested\\", namely: Syriac, Geez, Amarinna, Hindostani, Guzarattee, Basque, Wallachian, Californian, Algonquin (p. 467; for \\"Californian\\", an unknown native language of \\"Californian youths\\" Mezzofanti taught at the Propaganda, see p. 355).

Creative nonfiction contrasts with other nonfiction, such as academic or technical writing or journalism, which is also rooted in accurate fact but is not written to entertain based on prose style.  Characteristics and definition  For a text to be considered creative nonfiction, it must be factually accurate, and written with attention to literary style and technique. \\"Ultimately, the primary goal of the creative nonfiction writer is to communicate information, just like a reporter, but to shape it in a way that reads like fiction.\\" Forms within this genre include biography, autobiography, memoir, diary, travel writing, food writing, literary journalism, chronicle, personal essays, and other hybridized essays. According to Vivian Gornick, \\"A memoir is a tale taken from life‚Äîthat is, from actual, not imagined, occurrences‚Äîrelated by a first-person narrator who is undeniably the writer. Beyond these bare requirements it has the same responsibility as the novel or the short story: to shape a piece of experience so that it moves from a tale of private interest to one with meaning for the disinterested reader.\\" Critic Chris Anderson really claims that the genre can be understood best by splitting it into two subcategories‚Äîthe personal essay and the journalistic essay‚Äîbut the genre is currently defined by its lack of established conventions.Anderson, page ix. Literary critic Barbara Lounsberry‚Äîin her book, The Art of Fact‚Äîsuggests four constitutive characteristics of the genre, the first of which is \\"Documentable subject matter chosen from the real world as opposed to 'invented' from the writer's mind\\". By this, she means that the topics and events discussed in the text verifiably exist in the natural world. The second characteristic is \\"Exhaustive research,\\" which she claims allows writers \\"novel perspectives on their subjects\\" and \\"also permits them to establish the credibility of their narratives through verifiable references in their texts\\".Lounsberry, page xiii-xiv The third characteristic that Lounsberry claims is crucial in defining the genre is \\"The scene\\". She stresses the importance of describing and revivifying the context of events in contrast to the typical journalistic style of objective reportage.Lounsberry, page xiv-xv The fourth and final feature she suggests is \\"Fine writing: a literary prose style\\". \\"Verifiable subject matter and exhaustive research guarantee the nonfiction side of literary nonfiction; the narrative form and structure disclose the writer's artistry; and finally, its polished language reveals that the goal all along has been literature.\\"Lounsberry, page xv Creative nonfiction may be structured like traditional fiction narratives, as is true of Fenton Johnson's story of love and loss, Geography of the Heart, and Virginia Holman's Rescuing Patty Hearst. When book-length works of creative nonfiction follow a story-like arc, they are sometimes called narrative nonfiction. Other books, such as Daniel Levitin's This Is Your Brain on Music and The World in Six Songs, use elements of narrative momentum, rhythm, and poetry to convey a literary quality. Creative nonfiction often escapes traditional boundaries of narrative altogether, as happens in the bittersweet banter of Natalia Ginzburg's essay, \\"He and I\\", in John McPhee's hypnotic tour of Atlantic City, In Search of Marvin Gardens, and in Ander Monson's playful, experimental essays in Neck- Deep and Other Predicaments. Creative nonfiction writers have embraced new ways of forming their texts‚Äîincluding online technologies‚Äîbecause the genre leads itself to grand experimentation. Dozens of new journals have sprung up‚Äîboth in print and online‚Äîthat feature creative nonfiction prominently in their offerings.  Ethics and accuracy  Writers of creative or narrative non-fiction often discuss the level, and limits, of creative invention in their works and justify the approaches they have taken to relating true events. Melanie McGrath, whose book Silvertown, an account of her grandmother‚Äôs life, is \\"written in a novelist's idiom\\", writes in the follow- up, Hopping, that the known facts of her stories are \\"the canvas on to which I have embroidered. Some of the facts have slipped through the holes‚Äîwe no longer know them nor have any means of verifying them‚Äîand in these cases I have reimagined scenes or reconstructed events in a way I believe reflects the essence of the scene or the event in the minds and hearts of the people who lived through it. ... To my mind this literary tinkering does not alter the more profound truth of the story.\\" This concept of fact vs. fiction is elaborated upon in Brenda Miller and Suzanne Paola's book Tell It Slant.Nuala Calvi, authors of The Sugar Girls, a novelistic story based on interviews with former sugar-factory workers, make a similar point: \\"Although we have tried to remain faithful to what our interviewees have told us, at a distance of over half a century many memories are understandably incomplete, and where necessary we have used our own research, and our imaginations, to fill in the gaps. ... However, the essence of the stories related here is true, as they were told to us by those who experienced them at first hand.\\" In recent years, there have been several well-publicized incidents of memoir writers who exaggerated or fabricated certain facts in their work. For example: *In 1998, Swiss writer and journalist Daniel Ganzfried revealed that Binjamin Wilkomirski's memoir Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood, detailing his experiences as a child survivor of the Holocaust, contained factual inaccuracies. *The James Frey controversy hit in 2006, when The Smoking Gun website revealed that Frey's memoir, A Million Little Pieces, contained experiences that turned out to be fabrications. *In 2008, The New York Times featured an article about the memoirist Margaret Seltzer, whose pen name is Margaret B. Jones. Her publisher, Riverhead Books, canceled the publication of Seltzer's book, Love and Consequences, when it was revealed that Seltzer's story of her alleged experiences growing up as a half-white, half-Native American foster child and Bloods gang member in South Central Los Angeles were fictitious. Although there have been instances of traditional and literary journalists falsifying their stories, the ethics applied to creative nonfiction are the same as those that apply to journalism. The truth is meant to be upheld, just told in a literary fashion. Essayist John D'Agata explores the issue in his 2012 book The Lifespan of a Fact. It examines the relationship between truth and accuracy, and whether it is appropriate for a writer to substitute one for the other. He and fact-checker Jim Fingal have an intense debate about the boundaries of creative nonfiction, or \\"literary nonfiction\\".  Literary criticism  There is very little published literary criticism of creative nonfiction works, despite the fact that the genre is often published in respected publications such as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Harper's, and Esquire. A handful of the most widely recognized writers in the genre such as Robert Caro, Gay Talese, Joseph Mitchell, Tom Wolfe, John McPhee, Joan Didion, John Perkins, Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, Helen Garner and Norman Mailer have seen some criticism on their more prominent works. \\"Critics to date, however, have tended to focus on only one or two of each writer's works, to illustrate particular critical points.\\"Lounsberry, page xvi These analyses of a few key pieces are . As the popularity of the genre continues to expand, many nonfiction authors and a handful of literary critics are calling for more extensive literary analysis of the genre.

Literary critic He was born near Lausanne in Switzerland. Educated for the Protestant ministry, he was ordained in 1819, when already teacher of the French language and literature in the gymnasium at Basel; and throughout his life he was as much a critic as a theologian. His literary criticism brought him into contact with Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, for whom he obtained an invitation to lecture at Lausanne, which led to his famous work on Port-Royal.

He adjusted his theories to the work under review, and condemned nothing as long as it met his literary standards. Theologian As a theologian Vinet gave a fresh impulse to Protestant theology, especially in French-speaking lands, but also in England and elsewhere. Lord Acton classed him with Richard Rothe. His philosophy relied strongly on conscience, defined as that by which man stands in direct personal relation with God as moral sovereign, and the seat of a moral individuality which nothing can rightly infringe. He advocated complete freedom of religious belief, and to this end the formal separation of church and state in M√©moire en faveur de la libert√© des cultes (1826), Essai sur la conscience (1829), Essai sur la manifestation des convictions religieuses (1842). Accordingly, when in 1845 the civil power in the canton of Vaud interfered with the church's autonomy, he led a secession which took the name of L'√âglise libre. But already from 1831, when he published his Discours sur quelques sujets religieux (Nouveaux discours, 1841), he had begun to exert a liberalizing and deepening influence on religious thought far beyond his own canton, by bringing traditional doctrine to the test of a living personal experience (see also the philosophy of Gaston Frommel). In this he resembled Frederick William Robertson, as also in the change which he introduced into pulpit style and in the permanence of his influence. Vinet died at Clarens (Vaud). A considerable part of his work was not printed till after his death. References Further reading * *W.P. Keijzer, Vinet en Hollande (Groningen, 1941) *W.P.

A shaper is a type of machine tool that uses linear relative motion between the workpiece and a single-point cutting tool to machine a linear toolpath. Its cut is analogous to that of a lathe, except that it is (archetypally) linear instead of helical. A wood shaper is a functionally different woodworking tool, typically with a powered rotating cutting head and manually fed workpiece, usually known simply as a shaper in North America and spindle moulder in the UK. A metalworking shaper is somewhat analogous to a metalworking planer, with the cutter riding a ram that moves relative to a stationary workpiece, rather than the workpiece moving beneath the cutter. The ram is typically actuated by a mechanical crank inside the column, though hydraulically actuated shapers are increasingly used. Adding axes of motion to a shaper can yield helical toolpaths, as also done in helical planing.  Process  A single-point cutting tool is rigidly held in the tool holder, which is mounted on the ram. The work piece is rigidly held in a vice or clamped directly on the table. The table may be supported at the outer end. The ram reciprocates and the cutting tool, held in the tool holder, moves forwards and backwards over the work piece. In a standard shaper, cutting of material takes place during the forward stroke of the ram and the return stroke remains idle. The return is governed by a quick return mechanism. The depth of the cut increments by moving the workpiece, and the workpiece is fed by a pawl and ratchet mechanism. Types Shapers are mainly classified as standard, draw-cut, horizontal, universal, vertical, geared, crank, hydraulic, contour and traveling head,Shaper Mechanism Types with a horizontal arrangement most common. Vertical shapers are generally fitted with a rotary table to enable curved surfaces to be machined (same idea as in helical planing). The vertical shaper is essentially the same thing as a slotter (slotting machine), although technically a distinction can be made if one defines a true vertical shaper as a machine whose slide can be moved from the vertical. A slotter is fixed in the vertical plane Operation Shaper linkage. Note that the drive arm revolves through a smaller angle on the return stroke than for the cutting stroke, resulting in a quicker return stroke and more powerful cutting stroke. The workpiece mounts on a rigid, box- shaped table in front of the machine. The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram. Table motion may be controlled manually, but is usually advanced by an automatic feed mechanism acting on the feedscrew. The ram slides back and forth above the work. At the front end of the ram is a vertical tool slide that may be adjusted to either side of the vertical plane along the stroke axis. This tool-slide holds the clapper box and tool post, from which the tool can be positioned to cut a straight, flat surface on the top of the workpiece. The tool-slide permits feeding the tool downwards to deepen a cut. This flexibility, coupled with the use of specialized cutters and tool holders, enable the operator to cut internal and external gear teeth. The ram is adjustable for stroke and, due to the geometry of the linkage, it moves faster on the return (non-cutting) stroke than on the forward, cutting stroke. This return stroke is governed by a quick return mechanism. Uses The most common use is to machine straight, flat surfaces, but with ingenuity and some accessories a wide range of work can be done. Other examples of its use are: * Keyways in the boss of a pulley or gear can be machined without resorting to a dedicated broaching setup. * Dovetail slides * Internal splines and gear teeth. * Keyway, spline, and gear tooth cutting in blind holes * Cam drums with toolpaths of the type that in CNC milling terms would require 4- or 5-axis contouring or turn-mill cylindrical interpolation * It is even possible to obviate wire EDM work in some cases. Starting from a drilled or cored hole, a shaper with a boring-bar type tool can cut internal features that don't lend themselves to milling or boring (such as irregularly shaped holes with tight corners). * Smoothing of a rough surface  History  Samuel Bentham developed a shaper between 1791 and 1793. However, Roe (1916) credits James Nasmyth with the invention of the shaper in 1836., p. 92. Shapers were very common in industrial production from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th. In current industrial practice, shapers have been largely superseded by other machine tools (especially of the CNC type), including milling machines, grinding machines, and broaching machines. But the basic function of a shaper is still sound; tooling for them is minimal and very cheap to reproduce; and they are simple and robust in construction, making their repair and upkeep easily achievable. Thus they are still popular in many machine shops, from jobbing shops or repair shops to tool and die shops, where only one or a few pieces are required to be produced and the alternative methods are cost- or tooling-intensive. They also have considerable retro appeal to many hobbyist machinists, who are happy to obtain a used shaper or, in some cases, even to build a new one from scratch.

A Frenchman by birth, his family fled Alsace under German occupation in 1870 and he spent the rest of his life in Switzerland. He may best be described as continuing the spirit of Vinet amid the mental conditions marking the end of the 19th century. Like Vinet, he derived his philosophy of religion from a peculiarly deep experience of the Gospel of Christ as meeting the demands of the moral consciousness; but he developed even further than Vinet the psychological analysis of conscience and the method of verifying every doctrine by direct reference to spiritual experience. Both made much of moral individuality or personality as the crown and criterion of reality, believing that its correlation with Christianity, both historically and philosophically, was most intimate. But while Vinet laid most stress on the liberty from human authority essential to the moral consciousness, the changed needs of the age caused Frommel to develop rather the aspect of man's dependence as a moral being upon God's spiritual initiative, \\"the conditional nature of his liberty.\\" \\"Liberty is not the primary, but the secondary characteristic\\" of conscience; \\"before being free, it is the subject of obligation.\\" On this depends its objectivity as a real revelation of the Divine Will. Thus he claimed that a deeper analysis carried one beyond the human subjectivity of even Kant's categorical imperative, since consciousness of obligation was \\"une experience impos√©e sous le mode de l'absolu.\\" By his use of impos√©e Frommel emphasized the priority of man's sense of obligation to his consciousness either of self or of God. Here he appealed to the current psychology of the subconscious for confirmation of his analysis, by which he claimed to transcend mere intellectualism. In his language on this fundamental point he was perhaps too jealous of admitting an ideal element as implicit in the feeling of obligation. Still he did well in insisting on priority to self- conscious thought as a mark of metaphysical objectivity in the case of moral, no less than of physical experience. Further, he found in the Christian revelation the same characteristics as belonged to the universal revelation involved in conscience, viz., God's sovereign initiative and his living action in history. From this standpoint he argued against a purely psychological type of religion (agnosticisme religieux; as he termed it)--a tendency to which he saw even in A Sabatier and the symbolofid√©isme of the Paris School‚Äîas giving up a real and unifying faith. His influence on men, especially the student class, was greatly enhanced by the religious force and charm of his personality. Finally, like Vinet, he was a man of letters and a penetrating critic of men and systems.

The constituent assembly is entirely elected by popular vote; that is, all constituent assemblies are constitutional conventions, but a constitutional convention is not necessarily a constituent assembly. As the fundamental document constituting a state, a constitution cannot normally be modified or amended by the state's normal legislative procedures; instead a constitutional convention or a constituent assembly, the rules for which are normally laid down in the constitution, must be set up. A constituent assembly is usually set up for its specific purpose, which it carries out in a relatively short time, after which the assembly is dissolved. A constituent assembly is a form of representative democracy. Unlike forms of constitution-making in which a constitution is unilaterally imposed by a sovereign lawmaker, the constituent assembly creates a constitution through \\"internally imposed\\" actions, in that members of the constituent assembly are themselves citizens, but not necessarily the rulers, of the country for which they are creating a constitution.Id. at 125 As described by Columbia University Social Sciences Professor Jon Elster: Constitutions arise in a number of different ways. At the non-democratic extreme of the spectrum, we may imagine a sovereign lawgiver laying down the constitution for all later generations. At the democratic extreme, we may imagine a constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage for the sole task of writing a new constitution. And there are all sorts of intermediate arrangements.Axel Hadenius, ed., Democracy's Victory and Crisis, Ch 7: Ways of constitution-making by Jon Elster (p. 123); Cambridge University Press, 1997. 431 pp  Examples  = Costa Rica = Immediately after the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War that overthrew the Rafael Angel Calder√≥n Government, the leaders of the victorious side called for the election of a Constituent Assembly in the same year. The Assembly successfully drafted and approved the current Costa Rican Constitution. =Denmark= The Danish Constituent Assembly established the Constitution of Denmark in 1849. = France = During the French Revolution (from July 1789 to September 1791) a National Constituent Assembly () was formed when representatives assembled at the only location available ‚Äì a tennis court ‚Äì and swore the Tennis Court Oath on June 20, 1789, promising that they would not adjourn until they had drafted a new constitution for France. Louis XVI recognized the validity of the National Constituent Assembly on June 27, 1789.Paul R. Hanson, The A to Z of the French Revolution (2013) pp 85-86 See also 1848 French Constituent Assembly election = Iceland = On 27 November 2010, Iceland held an election for a constitutional assembly, with 522 people competing for 25 delegate seats. The assembly, in session for four months from early April until late July 2011, drafted a new constitution and passed it unanimously with 25 votes and no abstentions. On 20 October 2012 the parliament put the bill to a national referendum, in which 67% of the voters supported the bill. Further, 67% of the voters supported equal voting rights (one person, one vote) and 83% supported national ownership of natural resources, two key provisions of the bill. Parliament has failed to ratify the bill, however, inviting accusations that the political class is trying to thwart the will of the people by disrespecting the result of the 2012 constitutional referendum. = India = The Constituent Assembly of India was elected to write the Constitution of India, and served as its first Parliament as an independent nation. It was set up as a result of negotiations between the leaders of the Indian independence movement and members of the British Cabinet Mission. The constituent assembly was elected indirectly by the members of the Provincial legislative assembly, which existed under the British Raj. It first met on December 9, 1946, in Delhi. On August 15, 1947, India became an independent nation, and the Constituent Assembly started functioning as India's Parliament. B. R. Ambedkar drafted the Constitution of India in conjunction with the requisite deliberations and debates in the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly approved the Constitution on November 26, 1949 (celebrated as Constitution Day), and it took effect on January 26, 1950 ‚Äî a day now commemorated as Republic Day in India. Once the Constitution took effect, the Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India = Indonesia = The Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia was established to draw up a permanent constitution. Its membership was elected in November 1955, and it met for the first time in November 1956. After four sessions, it failed to agree on the fundamental basis for the state. It was dissolved in 1959, and the original constitution imposed by presidential decree.(OTP) =Italy= The Constituent Assembly of Italy was established in 1946 in the wake of Fascist Italy's defeat during World War II. It was elected with universal suffrage, simultaneously with a referendum about the adoption of Republic or the continuation of monarchy. Voters chose Republic, and the new assembly had the task to approve the new republic governments, as well as to write a new constitution. This was approved on 22 December 1947. It was dissolved on 31 January 1948, to be replaced by the new Parliament of Italy. = Nepal = Nepal has had two Constituent assemblies, the current one being elected after its predecessor failed to deliver a constitution, despite multiple extensions. It also serves as the country's parliament. Finally Nepal had made constitution with 89% majority. Nepal is adopting Federal states soon. = Russia = The Russian Constituent Assembly was established in Russia in the wake of the October Revolution of 1917 to form a new constitution after the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government. =Sri Lanka= The Sri Lankan Parliament approved the creation of a Sri Lankan Constitutional Assembly on March 9, 2016 proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe. The assembly will draft a new constitution for Sri Lanka. =Turkey= Constituent Assembly of Turkey was established in 1961 after the 1960 Turkish coup d'√©tat to prepare a democratic constitution. The constitution was prepared and approved by the voters in a referendum of 1961. = United States = Federal The U.S. Constitutional Convention that drafted the still-current United States Constitution in 1787 was notably not a constituent assembly: its delegates were appointed by the states, not directly elected, and not all states sent delegates; moreover, the Convention was originally charged with drafting amendments to the Articles of Confederation rather than a new constitution.See The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (Edited by Max Farrand; revised edition in Four Volumes, Yale University Press, 1966). The US Constitution contains no provision for its own replacement (and because of the presence of entrenched clauses it cannot be revoked through an amendment) so any constituent assembly would necessarily be extra-constitutional. Article V of the Constitution does permit Congress to appoint a national constitutional convention to propose amendments but it has never done so. While Congress has the option to submit both its own proposals for amendments and those of a national convention to state conventions rather than the state legislatures for ratification; this process has been used only once (for the Twenty-first Amendment). Neither of these would necessarily be constituent assemblies, as there is no provision requiring that such bodies be elected rather than appointed by the existing legislature. States The Virginia Constitutional Convention, 1830 (George Catlin, ca. 1830). Many state constituent assemblies, like the 1830 Virginia Constitutional Convention, were highly formalized but the legitimacy of the constitution they drafted depended on whether it was authorized by the people, not whether a particular procedure was followed. A tradition in the use of constituent assemblies exists at the state level of Constitutionalism. In fact, constituent assemblies met in the states before the formation of the Federal Constitution in 1787 as well as after its ratification. Since 1776 nearly 150 state constitutional conventions have met to draft or revise state constitutions.Albert L. Sturm, \\"The Development of American State Constitutions,\\" 12 Publius (1982), 57-98. These early state constitutional conventions frequently did not use procedural steps like popular ratification that became commonplace in the mid-19th century. Yet they were considered to be constituent assemblies that exercised their authority as that of the people.Marc W. Kruman, Between Authority and Liberty: State Constitution Making in Revolutionary America (Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1997), 1-33; Christian G. Fritz, \\"Alternative Visions of American Constitutionalism: Popular Sovereignty and the Early American Constitutional Debate,\\" 24 Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly (1997), 322-29; Christian G.

Fritz, \\"America's Unknown Constitutional World,\\" Bonus Article, > Common-Place, Vol. 9, No. 1 (Oct. 2008) American state constituent assemblies in the 19th and 20th centuries reflected many qualities of a citizen's movement.Laura J. Scalia, The Remaking of State Constitutions: The Uses of Liberalism in Designing Electoral Laws, 1820-1850 (Northern Illinois Univ. Press, 1999); John J. Dinan, The American State Constitutional Tradition (Univ. Press of Kansas, 2006). From the start of state American constitution-making, delegates to constitutional conventions studied earlier state models of constitutions. They often self-consciously \\"borrow[ed]\\" constitutional text and provisions from other states. They often used in their drafting and debates compact and pocket-sized compilations of all the existing American constitutions, so that the constituent's assembly could draw upon the latest in constitutional design.Marsha L. Baum and Christian G. Fritz, \\"American Constitution-Making: The Neglected State Constitutional Sources,\\" 27 Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly (2000), 199‚Äì242. Countries without an entrenched constitution A few countries do not have an entrenched constitution which can be amended by normal legislative procedures; the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Israel are examples. In these countries there is no need to call constituent assemblies, and no provision to do so, as the legislature can effectively modify the constitution. The constitution of New Zealand consists of a collection of statutes (Acts of Parliament), Treaties, Orders-in-Council, Letters Patent, decisions of the Courts and unwritten constitutional conventions. Because it is not supreme law, the constitution is comparatively easy to reform, requiring only a majority of Members of Parliament to amend it. The constitutional law of Israel is determined by the Knesset which, since 1949, serves as the country's ongoing constituent assembly. The Knesset has the power to create Basic Laws of Israel, laws which are entrenched legislation and will become part of a \\"future\\" constitution of Israel, as well as \\"regular\\" statutory legislation.

It ran on BBC2 from 1989 to 1993, and satirised satellite television in the UK at the time. History The show was in effect the TV version of Radio Active, which spoofed local radio stations, and was developed by the same team. It was written by Angus Deayton and Geoffrey Perkins, produced by Jamie Rix, directed by John Kilby and John Stroud, and with music by Philip Pope. The majority of the programme's scripts had already aired on Radio Active. The five key actors all performed various roles, some multiple, others on a single occasion. Their main characters as presenters were: * Angus Deayton as Mike Channel * Helen Atkinson-Wood as Anna Daptor * Michael Fenton Stevens as Martin Brown * Geoffrey Perkins as Mike Flex * Philip Pope simply as The Continuity Announcer (not named) The pilot show was broadcast on 12 May 1989, and a series of six programmes began on 3 May 1990. A second series of six began on 17 March 1992, and a final six episodes were broadcast between 17 September and 22 October 1993, plus an additional Children in Need special, making a total of 19 episodes. In 1992 the series won the Silver Rose and the Special Prize of the City of Montreux at the Festival Rose d'Or for the \\"Good Morning Calais\\" episode. In the DVD commentary for The Micallef Programme, lead writer and performer Shaun Micallef cites the series as an inspiration for his show's format. Format KYTV combined irreverent sketches and variety elements (such as song and dance routines) with a broad-based satire of the public perception of UK satellite television - that of opportunistic entrepreneurs producing cheap, low quality television in order to exploit viewers. KYTV was a fictional low-budget satellite television station named after its owner Sir Kenneth Yellowhammer, and bore a suspicious similarity to Sky Television. In the second series KYTV merged with the fictional \\"BSE Television\\", just as Sky merged with BSB. The channel's new name was also KYTV, composed from the first two letters of KYTV and the last two of BSETV. The third series featured parodies of Carlton Television's early logos. Each episode featured a central theme (for example, a terrorist siege, the Channel Tunnel, or a costume drama) around which sketches could revolve. Comedic elements included: * malfunctioning equipment * rolling news channels with little content or analysis * sensationalist and dumbed down shows (\\"Murder. Gruesome, bloody murder. Coming right up, after the break. Tell your neighbours.\\") * underpaid, incompetent and amateurish staff * lavish \\"showcase sequences\\" compared to shoddy, makeshift visuals or unfinished sets * endless repeats of imported or old (and therefore cheap) programmes as an attempt to fill yawning gulfs of airtime * relentless commercial intrusions, including plugs for shopping channels (\\"By the way Mike, that's a very smart tie you have on!\\" \\"Yes, and it's only ¬£18.99 at Sofa Shop!\\") A regular feature was \\"Mike Flex's Master Quiz\\", in which contestants typically had to answer one question correctly to win \\"a ch√¢teau in the Loire\\". Mike Flex always managed to arrange the questions in such a way that nobody's answer was ever quite right.

Early life Robbins is the older sister of fellow actress Amy Robbins, sculptor Jane Robbins and The Sheilas singer Emma Robbins. Her older brother is radio broadcaster Ted Robbins. Through her sister Emma she was the sister-in-law of Simon Shelton and through her sister Amy she is the sister-in-law of actor Robert Daws. Her father was Mike Robbins, who grew up in Hightown, Wrexham, the son of Ted, who served as the secretary of the Football Association of Wales for more than 35 years.

Robbins' first chart appearance was as a backing singer, along with her sister Jane, on the minor Top 40 hit \\"Lines\\" by Liverpool group the Planets , a spin-off from Deaf School. Her profile was raised soon afterwards when both she and Jane represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 as part of the group Prima Donna. They finished third. The following year, Robbins joined the cast of the ITV soap opera Crossroads, playing the part of a pop singer who was recording a single in the fictional motel's basement recording studio.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.  Life  Sabatier was born at Saint-Michel-de-Chabrillanoux in Ard√®che, and was educated at the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris. In 1885 he became vicar of St Nicolas, Strasbourg, but in 1889, declining an offer of preferment which was conditional on his becoming a German subject, he was expelled. For four years he was pastor of Saint-Cierge in Ard√®che, but had to retire in 1893 due to health concerns. He then devoted himself entirely to historical research, spending much of his time in Italy. He had already produced an edition of the Didache, and in November 1893 published his important Life of Francis of Assisi. This book gave a great stimulus to the study of medieval literary and religious documents, especially of such as are connected with the history of the Franciscan Order. In 1908 he delivered the Jowett Lectures on Modernism at the Passmore Edwards Settlement, London. Sabatier's 1893 book La vie de St. Fran√ßois d'Assise (translated as Life of St. Francis of Assisi in 1894) was placed upon the Index of Forbidden Books by the Catholic Church in 1894.

In almost all coilgun configurations, the coils and the gun barrel are arranged on a common axis. A coilgun is not a rifle as the barrel is smoothbore (not rifled). The name \\"Gauss\\" is in reference to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who formulated mathematical descriptions of the magnetic effect used by magnetic accelerator cannons. Coilguns generally consist of one or more coils arranged along a barrel, so the path of the accelerating projectile lies along the central axis of the coils. The coils are switched on and off in a precisely timed sequence, causing the projectile to be accelerated quickly along the barrel via magnetic forces. Coilguns are distinct from railguns, as the direction of acceleration in a railgun is at right angles to the central axis of the current loop formed by the conducting rails. In addition, railguns usually require the use of sliding contacts to pass a large current through the projectile or sabot but coilguns do not necessarily require sliding contacts. While some simple coilgun concepts can use ferromagnetic projectiles or even permanent magnet projectiles, most designs for high velocities actually incorporate a coupled coil as part of the projectile. Another form of coilgun is one which consists of a strong magnet on a rail. There are two metal balls on one end of the magnet. Another ball is placed next to the magnet, but not attracted to it. When the ball is pushed toward the magnet, it accelerates until it hits the magnet with some force and velocity. The momentum is transferred through the magnet to the last ball, which flies off the end with nearly as much force as the first ball started with.  History  The oldest electromagnetic gun came in the form of the coilgun, the first of which was invented by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland at the University of Kristiania (today Oslo). The invention was officially patented in 1904, although its development reportedly started as early as 1845. According to his accounts, Birkeland accelerated a 500-gram projectile to 50 m/s (110 mph; 180 km/h; 160 ft/s).archive.org: Popular Mechanics 06 1933 page 819 In 1933, Texan inventor Virgil Rigsby developed a stationary coilgun that was designed to be used like a machine gun. It was powered by a large electrical motor and generator. It appeared in many contemporary science publications, but never piqued the interest of any armed forces.  Construction  There are two main types or setups of a coilgun: single-stage and multistage. A single-stage coilgun uses one electromagnet to propel a projectile. A multistage coilgun uses several electromagnets in succession to progressively increase the speed of the projectile. = Ferromagnetic projectiles = A single stage coilgun For ferromagnetic projectiles, a single-stage coilgun can be formed by a coil of wire, an electromagnet, with a ferromagnetic projectile placed at one of its ends. This type of coilgun is formed like the solenoid used in an electromechanical relay, i.e. a current-carrying coil which will draw a ferromagnetic object through its center. A large current is pulsed through the coil of wire and a strong magnetic field forms, pulling the projectile to the center of the coil. When the projectile nears this point the electromagnet must be switched off, to prevent the projectile from becoming arrested at the center of the electromagnet. In a multistage design, further electromagnets are then used to repeat this process, progressively accelerating the projectile. In common coilgun designs, the \\"barrel\\" of the gun is made up of a track that the projectile rides on, with the driver into the magnetic coils around the track. Power is supplied to the electromagnet from some sort of fast discharge storage device, typically a battery, or high-capacity high voltage capacitors (one per electromagnet), designed for fast energy discharge. A diode is used to protect polarity sensitive components (such as semiconductors or electrolytic capacitors) from damage due to inverse polarity of the voltage after turning off the coil. Many hobbyists use low-cost rudimentary designs to experiment with coilguns, for example using photoflash capacitors from a disposable camera, or a capacitor from a standard cathode-ray tube television as the energy source, and a low inductance coil to propel the projectile forward. = Non-ferromagnetic projectiles = Some designs have non- ferromagnetic projectiles, of materials such as aluminium or copper, with the armature of the projectile acting as an electromagnet with internal current induced by pulses of the acceleration coils. A superconducting coilgun called a quench gun could be created by successively quenching a line of adjacent coaxial superconducting coils forming a gun barrel, generating a wave of magnetic field gradient traveling at any desired speed. A traveling superconducting coil might be made to ride this wave like a surfboard. The device would be a mass driver or linear synchronous motor with the propulsion energy stored directly in the drive coils. Another method would have non- superconducting acceleration coils and propulsion energy stored outside them but a projectile with superconducting magnets. Though the cost of power switching and other factors can limit projectile energy, a notable benefit of some coilgun designs over simpler railguns is avoiding an intrinsic velocity limit from hypervelocity physical contact and erosion. By having the projectile pulled towards or levitated within the center of the coils as it is accelerated, no physical friction with the walls of the bore occurs. If the bore is a total vacuum (such as a tube with a plasma window), there is no friction at all, which helps prolong the period of reusability. = Switching = A multistage coilgun One main obstacle in coilgun design is switching the power through the coils. There are several common solutions‚Äîthe simplest (and probably least effective) is the spark gap, which releases the stored energy through the coil when the voltage reaches a certain threshold. A better option is to use solid-state switches; these include IGBTs or power MOSFETs (which can be switched off mid-pulse) and SCRs (which release all stored energy before turning off). A quick-and-dirty method for switching, especially for those using a flash camera for the main components, is to use the flash tube itself as a switch. By wiring it in series with the coil, it can silently and non-destructively (assuming that the energy in the capacitor is kept below the tube's safe operating limits) allow a large amount of current to pass through to the coil. Like any flash tube, ionizing the gas in the tube with a high voltage triggers it. However, a large amount of the energy will be dissipated as heat and light, and, because of the tube being a spark gap, the tube will stop conducting once the voltage across it drops sufficiently, leaving some charge remaining on the capacitor. = Resistance = The electrical resistance of the coils and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the current source dissipate considerable power. At low speeds the heating of the coils dominates the percentage efficiency of the coilgun, giving exceptionally low efficiency. However, as speeds climb, mechanical power grows proportional to the square of the speed, but, correctly switched, the resistive losses are largely unaffected, and thus these resistive losses become much smaller in percentage terms. = Magnetic circuit = Ideally, 100% of the magnetic flux generated by the coil would be delivered to and act on the projectile; in reality this is impossible due to energy losses always present in a real system, which cannot be entirely eliminated. With a simple air-cored solenoid, the majority of the magnetic flux is not coupled into the projectile because of the magnetic circuit's high reluctance. The uncoupled flux generates a magnetic field that stores energy in the surrounding air. The energy that is stored in this field does not simply disappear from the magnetic circuit once the capacitor finishes discharging, instead returning to the coilgun's electric circuit. Because the coilgun's electric circuit is inherently analogous to an LC oscillator, the unused energy returns in the reverse direction ('ringing'), which can seriously damage polarized capacitors such as electrolytic capacitors. Reverse charging can be prevented by a diode connected in reverse-parallel across the capacitor terminals; as a result, the current keeps flowing until the diode and the coil's resistance dissipate the field energy as heat. While this is a simple and frequently utilized solution, it requires an additional expensive high-power diode and a well-designed coil with enough thermal mass and heat dissipation capability in order to prevent component failure. Some designs attempt to recover the energy stored in the magnetic field by using a pair of diodes. These diodes, instead of being forced to dissipate the remaining energy, recharge the capacitors with the right polarity for the next discharge cycle. This will also avoid the need to fully recharge the capacitors, thus significantly reducing charge times. However, the practicality of this solution is limited by the resulting high recharge current through the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitors; the ESR will dissipate some of the recharge current, generating heat within the capacitors and potentially shortening their lifetime. To reduce component size, weight, durability requirements, and most importantly, cost, the magnetic circuit must be optimized to deliver more energy to the projectile for a given energy input. This has been addressed to some extent by the use of back iron and end iron, which are pieces of magnetic material that enclose the coil and create paths of lower reluctance in order to improve the amount of magnetic flux coupled into the projectile. Results can vary widely, depending on the materials used; hobbyist designs may use, for example, materials ranging anywhere from magnetic steel (more effective, lower reluctance) to video tape (little improvement in reluctance). Moreover, the additional pieces of magnetic material in the magnetic circuit can potentially exacerbate the possibility of flux saturation and other magnetic losses. = Ferromagnetic projectile saturation = Another significant limitation of the coilgun is the occurrence of magnetic saturation in the ferromagnetic projectile. When the flux in the projectile lies in the linear portion of its material's B(H) curve, the force applied to the core is proportional to the square of coil current (I)‚Äîthe field (H) is linearly dependent on I, B is linearly dependent on H and force is linearly dependent on the product BI. This relationship continues until the core is saturated; once this happens B will only increase marginally with H (and thus with I), so force gain is linear. Since losses are proportional to I2, increasing current beyond this point eventually decreases efficiency although it may increase the force. This puts an absolute limit on how much a given projectile can be accelerated with a single stage at acceptable efficiency. = Projectile magnetization and reaction time = Apart from saturation, the B(H) dependency often contains a hysteresis loop and the reaction time of the projectile material may be significant. The hysteresis means that the projectile becomes permanently magnetized and some energy will be lost as a permanent magnetic field of the projectile. The projectile reaction time, on the other hand, makes the projectile reluctant to respond to abrupt B changes; the flux will not rise as fast as desired while current is applied and a B tail will occur after the coil field has disappeared. This delay decreases the force, which would be maximized if the H and B were in phase.  Induction coilguns  Most of the work to develop coilguns as hyper-velocity launchers has used \\"air-cored\\" systems to get around the limitations associated with ferromagnetic projectiles. In these systems, the projectile is accelerated by a moving coil \\"armature\\". If the armature is configured as one or more \\"shorted turns\\" then induced currents will result as a consequence of the time variation of the current in the static launcher coil (or coils). In principle, coilguns can also be constructed in which the moving coils are fed with current via sliding contacts. However, the practical construction of such arrangements requires the provision of reliable high speed sliding contacts. Although feeding current to a multi-turn coil armature might not require currents as large as those required in a railgun, the elimination of the need for high speed sliding contacts is an obvious potential advantage of the induction coilgun relative to the railgun. Air cored systems also introduce the penalty that much higher currents may be needed than in an \\"iron cored\\" system. Ultimately though, subject to the provision of appropriately rated power supplies, air cored systems can operate with much greater magnetic field strengths than \\"iron cored\\" systems, so that, ultimately, much higher accelerations and forces should be possible.  Potential uses  A M934 mortar round is adapted for experimental coilgun launch with a conformal armature tail kit, to be fired through a barrel composed of short solenoidal electromagnets stacked end to end Small coilguns are recreationally made by hobbyists, typically up to several joules to tens of joules projectile energy (the latter comparable to a typical air gun and an order of magnitude less than a firearm) while ranging from under one percent to several percent efficiency. In 2018, a Los Angeles- based company Arcflash Labs offered the first coilgun for sale to the general public. It fired 6-gram steel slugs at 45 m/s with a muzzle energy of approximately 5 joules. Much higher efficiency and energy can be obtained with designs of greater expense and sophistication. In 1978, Bondaletov in the USSR achieved record acceleration with a single stage by sending a 2-gram ring to 5000 m/s in 1 cm of length, but the most efficient modern designs tend to involve many stages. Above 90% efficiency is estimated for some vastly larger superconducting concepts for space launch. An experimental 45-stage DARPA coilgun mortar design is 22% efficient, with 1.6 megajoules KE delivered to a round. to orbit Though facing the challenge of competitiveness versus conventional guns (and sometimes railgun alternatives), coilguns are being researched for weaponry. The DARPA Electromagnetic Mortar program is an example of potential benefits, if practical challenges like sufficiently low weight can be managed. The coilgun would be relatively silent with no smoke giving away its position, though a coilgun projectile would still create a sonic boom if supersonic. Adjustable yet smooth acceleration of the projectile throughout the barrel can allow somewhat higher velocity, with a predicted range increase of 30% for a 120mm EM mortar over the conventional version of similar length. With no separate propellant charges to load, the researchers envision the firing rate to approximately double. In 2006, a 120mm prototype was under construction for evaluation, though time before reaching field deployment, if such occurs, was estimated then as 5 to 10+ years by Sandia National Laboratories. In 2011, development was proposed of an 81mm coilgun mortar to operate with a hybrid-electric version of the future Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. Electromagnetic aircraft catapults are planned, including on board future U.S. Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers. An experimental induction coilgun version of an Electromagnetic Missile Launcher (EMML) has been tested for launching Tomahawk missiles. A coilgun-based active defense system for tanks is under development at HIT in China. Coilgun potential has been perceived as extending beyond military applications. Challenging and corresponding to a magnitude of capital investment that few entities could readily fund, gigantic coilguns with projectile mass and velocity on the scale of gigajoules of kinetic energy (as opposed to megajoules or less) have not been developed so far, but such have been proposed as launchers from the Moon or from Earth: * An ambitious lunar-base proposal considered within a 1975 NASA study would have involved a 4000-ton coilgun sending 10 million tons of lunar material to L5 in support of massive space colonization (cumulatively over years, utilizing a large 9900-ton power plant). * A 1992 NASA study calculated that a 330-ton lunar superconducting quenchgun could launch annually 4400 projectiles, each 1.5 tons and mostly liquid oxygen payload, using a relatively small amount of power, 350 kW average. * After NASA Ames estimated how to meet aerothermal requirements for heat shields with terrestrial surface launch, Sandia National Laboratories investigated electromagnetic launchers to orbit, in addition to researching other EML applications, both railguns and coilguns. In 1990, a kilometer-long coilgun was proposed for launch of small satellites. * Later investigations at Sandia included a 2005 study of the StarTram concept for an extremely long coilgun, one version conceived as launching passengers to orbit with survivable acceleration. * A mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload. Once the payload has been accelerated, the two separate, and the holder is slowed and recycled for another payload.

When Fianna F√°il returned to power after the 1987 general election, she became Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. She had expected a senior government position, but was disappointed.Kenny, Shane and Keane, Fergal, Irish Politics Now: 'This Week' Guide to the 25th D√°il, Dingle, Co. Kerry: Brandon/RT√â, 1987, p. 61 She resigned in 1991, in opposition to Charles Haughey's leadership of the party. The following year Albert Reynolds, whom she now backed for the leadership, became Taoiseach and Fianna F√°il leader. For her loyalty to Reynolds, she was appointed Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. She became Minister for Justice in 1993, in which post she introduced substantial law reform legislation, including the decriminalisation of homosexuality; she was also briefly acting Minister for Equality and Law Reform in late 1994, following the resignation of Labour Party Minister Mervyn Taylor from Reynolds' coalition government. James Reilly When Reynolds resigned as leader of Fianna F√°il in November 1994, Geoghegan-Quinn was seen as his preferred successor in the position.David Sharrock, \\"New coalition likely to avert Irish poll; Finance minister looks certain to take over from Reynolds\\", The Guardian, 19 November 1994. In the resulting leadership election she stood against Bertie Ahern; a win would have made her the first female Taoiseach. On the day of the vote, however, she withdrew from the contest \\"in the interests of party unity\\". It was reported that she had the support of only 15 members of the 66-strong parliamentary party.John Burns, \\"Softly, softly, says Ahern\\", The Sunday Times, 20 November 1994. At the 1997 general election she retired from politics completely, citing privacy issues, after details about her 17-year-old son's expulsion from school appeared in the newspapers. \\"If his mother had been a homemaker, an architect or a businesswoman, this simply would not have happened\\" she commented.Alan Murdoch, \\"Media blamed as Ireland's first woman cabinet minister quits\\", The Independent, 28 January 1997. Other reports suggested that she saw her prospects for promotion under Ahern as poor,Denis Coughlan, \\"Maybe more than a matter of family privacy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn will be a big loss to Fianna Fail, but the denizens of Leinster House are already calling 'next business',\\" Irish Times, 28 January 1997. and a weak showing in constituency opinion polls indicated her seat could be in danger.John Burns and Rory Godson, \\"Desperately seeking candidates\\", The Sunday Times, 19 January 1997. She became a non- executive director of Aer Lingus, a member of the board of the Declan Ganley- owned Ganley Group, and wrote a column for The Irish Times. Geoghegan-Quinn was appointed to the European Court of Auditors in 1999, replacing former Labour Party politician and Minister Barry Desmond. She was appointed for a second term at the Court of Auditors in March 2006, and resigned on 9 February 2010. She was nominated by the Taoiseach Brian Cowen to become Ireland's European Commissioner in November 2009, and was subsequently allocated the Research, Innovation and Science portfolio. In April 2010, after numerous calls were made over several days for Geoghegan-Quinn to surrender her pensions as an Irish former politician‚Äîwhich are worth over ‚Ç¨104,000‚Äîwhile she remained in a paid public office, she did so. In July 2015, it was announced that she would chair an independent panel to examine issues of gender equality among Irish higher education staff.

He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1989 to 1994, and as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1969 to 1989.  Early life  He was born in Cork in 1935, and was educated at Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠, the School of Commerce and University College Cork. He became a trade union official with the ITGWU (which would later merge with other trade unions, becoming SIPTU) and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Con was the President of the IT&GWU; in Cork. His father Cornelius (Con) was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1965‚Äì66 and was active in the labour movement.  Political career  Desmond first entered D√°il √âireann at the 1969 general election, when he was elected as a Labour Party TD for D√∫n Laoghaire and Rathdown. He retained his seat there in 1973 and was then elected in 1977 at D√∫n Laoghaire, where he won a seat at every election until his retirement from the D√°il in 1989.

In the second FitzGerald administration, Desmond was appointed Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health. FitzGerald began a major cabinet reshuffle in February 1986, with the intention to appoint him as Minister for Justice; Desmond refused, and Spring supported him in that attitude.

Frusciante released the album after encouragement from several friends, who told him that there was \\"no good music around anymore.\\" Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt combines avant-garde and stream-of-consciousness styles, with guitar, piano and various effects on a four-track recorder. The album's first half, Niandra LaDes, was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992, during the recording of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The second half, Usually Just a T-Shirt, was recorded while the band was on tour in the months leading up to Frusciante's departure. Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt sold poorly upon its release in 1994. It was re-released in 1999.  Background  Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988, at the age of 18, and released his first album with the group, Mother's Milk, the following year. The follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, was recorded in an empty mansion that the band decided to live in for the duration of recording.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 274‚Äì275 Frusciante adapted well to the environment, and often spent his time alone painting, listening to music, and recording songs that would eventually make up the first half of the album, Niandra LaDes. Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991 and was an instant success. The album peaked at number three in the U.S. and went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide. Soon after the album's release, Frusciante developed a dislike of the band's newfound popularity. He felt that the band was too famous, and wished they were still playing small nightclubs like they were before he joined the group.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 229 By his own admission, the band's rise to popularity took Frusciante by surprise, and he could not cope with it. During Blood Sugar Sex Magik's promotional tour, Frusciante began using heroin and cocaine heavily.Dalley, Helen (August 2002). \\"John Frusciante\\" Total Guitar Magazine. Retrieved on August 27, 2007. He and vocalist Anthony Kiedis often argued before and after performances. According to Kiedis, Frusciante purposely sabotaged the Saturday Night Live performance of \\"Under the Bridge\\" by playing the wrong intro for the song and out of key.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 288 His relationship with the band had become progressively more strained, and he abruptly quit during the Japanese leg of their world tour in 1992.  Writing and recording  After leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante continued to write and record solo material. He had been doing so since the age of nine, but had never considered releasing his material to the public.VPRO Interview with John Frusciante (1994) That was until several of his friends‚Äîincluding Johnny Depp, Perry Farrell, Gibby Haynes and Red Hot Chili Peppers band mate Flea‚Äîencouraged him to release the material he wrote in his spare time during the Blood Sugar Sex Magik sessions.Kenneally, Tim. (October 1, 1994) \\"Frusciante Steps Out With American Set\\". Billboard Magazine Frusciante began working on final cuts of the songs he had been writing, and producing them at his home in mid-1992. The production process, however, became hampered by his increasingly severe addiction to heroin. Usually Just a T-Shirt was recorded in the order it appears, with the final tracks being recorded shortly prior to Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers. Frusciante's use of heroin and cocaine became more extreme during the final stages of recording in late 1993; he began viewing drugs as the only way to \\"make sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul.\\" During a 1994 interview, a visibly intoxicated Frusciante noted that he wrote the album in order to create \\"interesting music\\", which he felt no longer existed. He felt contemporary artists were not writing material he deemed worth listening to and the mainstream population were settling for mediocrity. Drugs were another significant topic on which Frusciante based Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt.Apter, 2004. p. 278 According to Frusciante, he \\"was stoned for every single note [he] played on the album.\\" He increased his drug use to cope with worsening depression that was caused by leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his subsequent isolation. Several songs on the album deal with his dislike for the Chili Peppers' success, such as the album's eleventh track, \\"Blood on My Neck From Success\\". All of the music on the record was written by Frusciante, save for the cover of hardcore punk band Bad Brains' song \\"Big Takeover\\". The track was intentionally slowed down and recorded melodically because of a pastime in which Frusciante sang punk songs in different tempos: \\"It was just something I had been walking around thinking of in my head. Sometimes I'll walk around singing punk rock songs to myself, but as if they were regular songs instead of punk rock songs, you know, slow it down and make a melody instead of just yelling them out. And then the idea occurred me to record it like a Led Zeppelin ballad with mandolins and stuff.\\"Broxvoort, Brian (1994). \\"John Frusciante Goes Over a Bridge.\\" Rockinfreakapotamus. River Phoenix, a friend of Frusciante's, had contributed guitar and backing vocals to two songs that were intended be included on the record, but they were ultimately left off due to protests from his family. These were later included under different names on the album Smile from the Streets You Hold in 1997. Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt incorporated Frusciante's avant-garde style of song composition, with his stream-of-consciousness methodology. He recorded, mixed, produced and mastered the entire record by himself, and released it on Rick Rubin's label, American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, originally held the rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. Because he was living as a recluse, however, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album under his label.  Release, reception, and aftermath  Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt was initially previewed by Billboard magazine, who said that \\"Chili Peppers fans might be daunted by the album's elusive experimentalism.\\"Apter, 2004. p. 279 A representative of American Recordings did not foresee the album as being viable in any mainstream music stores, and some retailers went as far as to ban it from being sold. After the album was released, Frusciante played three small performances, and participated in a few magazine interviews to promote the album, explaining in one interview that people would only be able to understand his work if \\"their heads are capable of tripping out.\\" At one point shortly after release, Frusciante began searching for a string quartet to play the album with him on tour. The idea was eventually discarded when he could not find a band that \\"understands why Ringo Starr is such a great drummer, can play Stravinsky, and also smokes pot.\\" The concept of a tour was ultimately abandoned as well, due to Frusciante's diminishing health. Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt was not widely reviewed, but yielded a generally positive response from critics. Steve Huey of AllMusic, who rated the album four out of five stars, said that \\"[the album was] an intriguing and unexpected departure from Frusciante's work with the Chili Peppers\\", and that \\"the sparse arrangements of the first half help set the stage for the gossamer guitar work later on.\\" He went on to say that Usually Just a T-Shirt‚Äîthe latter half of the album‚Äîcontained \\"pleasant psychedelic instrumentals with plenty of backward-guitar effects.\\" Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, noted that \\"there's nothing quite so stunning as [Frusciante's] magnificent remake of Bad Brains' 'The Big Takeover'.\\" Adam Williams of PopMatters said the album \\"fall[s] somewhere between madness and brilliance\\". He went on to compare Frusciante to Syd Barrett, and felt it was a \\"hint at a deeply cerebral artist looking within for inspiration and creativity.\\" High Times' Tim Kenneally saw the record as \\"a revelation, both disturbingly intimate and cryptically veiled. Ladeled straight out of the guitarist's stream of consciousness, it's worlds away from the up-front, balls-out funk assault of his former band,\\" with \\"an ethereal, otherworldly quality.\\"Kenneally, Tim (July, 1995). \\"Chilly Pepper.\\" High Times. The album received its share of negative criticism as well. Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard felt \\"Frusciante's eccentricities run seriously amok\\", and that \\" [the album] sounds like a string of four-track demos. The first part of the album is slightly more tuneful than the more ambient, experimental second section[...] Mostly what you get are Frusciante's acoustic-guitar scratchings and stream-of-conscious ramblings.\\" The first Rolling Stone review of the record, however, was positive: \\"All in all, [the album is] a mess‚Äîbut definitely a fascinating, often lovely mess. As one might expect of an album titled Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-shirt this is twisted, cool stuff.\\"Wild, David (December, 1994). \\"As If We Needed One, Here's A Reminder of Dylan's Power.\\" Rolling Stone. The Boston Herald said that while the album was \\"a stark display of Frusciante's acoustic guitar virtuosity\\" and \\"eerily beautiful\\", the singing was \\"terrible; his high notes will drive the neighborhood dogs into a frenzy.\\"\\"Music Discs Dionne Farris' arresting vocals bloom into.\\" Boston Herald. December 9, 1994. Venice Beach, California in 1994. Frusciante's drug addiction worsened as the years progressed. An article published by the New Times LA described him as \\"a skeleton covered in thin skin\\". He participated in an interview with Dutch public broadcast station VPRO‚Äîthe first media appearance he made since leaving the Chili Peppers. In the interview Frusciante speaks of the positive effects drugs have had on his mind and proudly admits to being a \\"junkie\\". He went on to confess addictions to heroin and crack cocaine, but ultimately described himself as being in the best health of his life. In 1997, Frusciante released his second solo album Smile From the Streets You Hold, primarily for drug money. Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt was estimated to have sold only 45,000 copies when Frusciante ordered it out of print in 1998‚Äîwhen Frusciante rehabilitated and rejoined the Chili Peppers. Smile From the Streets You Hold was withdrawn from the market a year later. In 1999 Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt was re-released on American Recordings. In the early 2000s, Frusciante said he planned to re-release Smile From the Streets You Hold sometime in the future, but did not give any indication as to when. It was eventually re-released on American Records in Europe of 2006.Discogs In 2000, Frusciante had a brief relationship with actress Milla Jovovich who said she fell in love with him after hearing Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt in 1994. ‚ÄúIt was, like, six years ago, and literally the day I heard his voice for the first time, I was like, ‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù.

It was available as both a standard black vinyl edition and a deluxe translucent red vinyl edition (limited to 1,000 copies) with 7\\" b-side.  Track listing  Niandra LaDes was recorded between late 1990 and mid-1991 at John‚Äôs Home in Los Angeles, CA, with the exception of Running Away Into You, which was recorded in mid-1992 after he quit the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The commercial release features 13 songs out of the 15 that Frusciante initially intended. \\"Bought Her Soul\\" and \\"Soul Removal\\" were ultimately left off the album at the request of River Phoenix's family and later released on his second album, Smile from the Streets You Hold, under different names, \\"Well, I've Been\\" and \\"Height Down\\". \\"Ants\\" was a cassette-only bonus track.John Frusciante - Niandra LaDes And Usually Just A T-Shirt (1994, Cassette)  DiscogsJohn Frusciante - Niandra LaDes And Usually Just A T-Shirt (1994, Black Shell, Cassette)  Discogs Usually Just a T-Shirt was recorded between early 1991 and mid-1992 at John‚Äôs Home in Los Angeles, CA.

Biography =Early life= Pabst was born on March 28, 1836, in the village of Nikolausrieth, in the Province of Saxony, in the Kingdom of Prussia. Friedrich was the second child of Gottlieb Pabst, a local farmer, and his wife, Johanna Friederike.John Eastberg, \\"Frederick Pabst: From Sea Captain to Beer Baron \\", Max Kade Institute Friends Newsletter, vol. 16, no. 2 (Summer 2007), p. 1. In 1848, he emigrated with his parents to the United States, settling first in Milwaukee, and then Chicago. The following year his mother died in a cholera epidemic.Eastberg, p. 3. In Chicago, Frederick and his father had to eke out a living. For a while they worked as waiters and busboys. Frederick soon gave this up, however. Because he had enjoyed his voyage to America, he decided to become a cabin-boy on a Lake Michigan steamer. By the time he was 21, Pabst had earned his pilot's license, and was captain of one of these vessels. In this capacity, he met Phillip Best, the owner of a small but prosperous brewery founded by his father, Jacob Best, in 1844 in Milwaukee. Pabst married Best's daughter, Maria, on March 25, 1862. For the next year and a half, Pabst continued to ply the waters of Lake Michigan as a ship's captain, until an accident in December 1863 led to a change in career. While trying to bring his craft into Milwaukee harbor, Pabst's ship ran aground. A short while later, Pabst purchased half of Best's brewing company. =Brewing= In 1864, when Pabst was taken into partnership in his father-in-law's brewery, he began to study the details of the business. After obtaining a thorough mastery of the art of brewing, Pabst turned his attention to extending the market for the beer and before long had raised the output of the Best brewery to 100,000 barrels a year. The brewery was eventually converted into a public company and its capital repeatedly increased in order to cope with the continually increasing trade. He became president of the corporation in 1873. Later, the brewing company's name was changed to the Pabst Brewing Company. In 1889, Pabst spent $30,000 to take advantage of prime shoreline along Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin's unique location, just north of the city of Milwaukee, by developing a popular lakeshore resort, which he called the Pabst Whitefish Bay Resort. As many as 10,000 visitors would come to the resort on a summer day by horse and buggy, railroad, trolley or excursion steamer. They came to enjoy the scenic view, to ride the Ferris wheel, attend daily concerts (double concerts on Sunday), rent row boats, watch outdoor movies, drink Pabst's beer and dine on fine fare, including five types of whitefish netted daily in the adjoining bay. The resort's popularity faded in 1914 at the start of World War I and the park was closed. In 1915 the land was subdivided into residential lots. The brewing company's renowned \\"Blue Ribbon\\" label was introduced in the 1890s. The beer never actually won a blue ribbon. During some festivals (i.e. World's Fair in Chicago), Pabst placed a blue ribbon around his Best beer (named after founder Phillip Best) so it would stand out among the others. People would start identifying the beer as the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Instead of correcting the public, Pabst just wisely renamed it. He trademarked the Blue Ribbon in 1900.Weiss, Jana. \\"Frederick Pabst.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 2, edited by William J. Hausman. German Historical Institute. Last modified March 23, 2016. Pabst built a fourteen- story Pabst Building in downtown Milwaukee and also helped organize the Wisconsin National Bank, in 1893. Pabst purchased the old Nunnemacher Grand Opera House, located opposite the Milwaukee City Hall, in 1890, and turned it into the Das Neue Deutsche Stadt-Theater (The New German City Theater), but it was destroyed in a fire. Pabst ordered it rebuilt at once and the newly named Pabst Theater opened in 1895. It still is in use today. The Pabst Mansion along Wisconsin Avenue is a well-known Milwaukee tourist attraction and was the Pabst family home from 1892 to 1908. =Personal life= Tombstone in Forest Home Cemetery Pabst was married in 1862 and had 10 children. Five survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (von Ernst, 1865-1891),Cheryl Elaine Brookshear, An Interpretation of the Captain Frederick Pabst Mansion: The Response Based Approach, master's thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 2000, p. 52.

The Pabsts also adopted Elizabeth's daughter, Elsbeth, after Elizabeth died unexpectedly in 1891.Brookshear, p. 53. He had two stock farms, one in Wauwatosa and one in Calhoun for raising Percheron horses. The original stock had been imported by him from France. Pabst was affiliated with Aurora Masonic Lodge No. 30. =Death= Pabst is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

It was the principal city of the former province of Nivernais. It is south-southeast of Paris. History Nevers first enters written history as Noviodunum, a town held by the Aedui at Roman contact. The quantities of medals and other Roman antiquities found on the site indicate the importance of the place, and in 52 BCE, Julius Caesar made Noviodunum, which he describes as in a convenient position on the banks of the Loire, a depot (B. G. vii. 55). There he had his hostages, corn, his military chest, with the money in it allowed him from home for the war, his own and his army's baggage and a great number of horses which had been bought for him in Spain and Italy. After his failure before Gergovia, the Aedui at Noviodunum massacred those who were there to look after stores, the negotiators, and the travelers who were in the place. They divided the money and the horses among themselves, carried off in boats all the corn that they could, and burned the rest or threw it into the river. Thinking they could not hold the town, they burned it. This was a great loss to Caesar; and it may seem that he was imprudent in leaving such great stores in the power of treacherous allies. But he was in straits during this year, and probably he could not have done other than he did. Dio Cassius (xl. 38) tells the story of Caesar out of the affair of Noviodunum. He states incorrectly what Caesar did on the occasion, and he shows that he neither understood his original nor knew what he was writing about. The city was later called Nevirnum, as the name appears in the Antonine Itinerary. In the Tabula Peutingeriana, it is corrupted into Ebrinum. In still other sources the name appears as Nebirnum. It became the seat of a bishopric at the end of the 5th century. The county dates at least from the beginning of the 10th century. The citizens of Nevers obtained charters in 1194 and in 1231. For a short time in the 14th century the town was the seat of a university, transferred from Orl√©ans, to which it was restored. In 1565 the town became the seat of a branch of the Gonzaga family, which in 1627 succeeded to the Duchy of Mantua. This line of the Gonzaga Dukes of Nevers itself died out in 1708. Geography Nevers is situated on the slope of a hill on the right bank of the Loire River. Climate Main sights Ducal Palace of Nevers, in France. Saint Bernadette, seer of Our Lady of Lourdes apparitions. Narrow winding streets lead from the quay through the town where there are numerous old houses dating from the 14th to the 17th century. Among the ecclesiastical buildings the most important is the Cath√©drale of Saint Cyr-Sainte Julitte, dedicated to Saint Quiricus and Saint Julietta, which is a combination of two buildings, and possesses two apses. The apse and transept at the west end are the remains of a Romanesque church, while the nave and eastern apse are in the Gothic style and belong to the 14th century. There is no transept at the eastern end. The lateral portal on the south side belongs to the late 15th century; the massive and elaborately decorated tower which rises beside it to the early 16th century. The church of Saint Etienne is a specimen of the Romanesque style of Auvergne of which the disposition of the apse with its three radiating chapels is characteristic. It was consecrated at the close of the 9th century, and belonged to a priory affiliated to Cluny. The Ducal Palace (now occupied by the courts of justice and an important ceramic museum) was built in the 15th and 16th centuries and is one of the principal feudal edifices in central France. The fa√ßade is flanked at each end by a turret and a round tower. A middle tower containing the great staircase has its windows adorned by sculptures relating to the history of the House of La Marck by the members of which the greater part of the palace was built. Behind the palace lies an open space with a fine view over the valley of the Loire. The Porte du Croux, a square tower, with corner turrets, dating from the end of the 14th century, is among the remnants of the old fortifications; it now contains a collection of sculptures and Roman antiquities. A triumphal arch from the 18th century, commemorating the victory of Fontenoy and the hotel de ville, a modern building which contains the library, are of some interest. The Loire is crossed by a modern stone bridge, and by an iron railway bridge. At the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the mother house of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers, it is possible to view the incorrupt body of Saint Bernadette Soubirous, the famous seer of Our Lady of Lourdes apparitions, which are presented in a gold and crystal reliquary. Economy Nevers is the seat of a bishopric, of tribunals of first instance and of commerce and of a Cour d'assises and has a chamber of commerce and a branch of the Bank of France. Its educational institutions include several lyc√©es, a training college for female teachers, ecclesiastical seminaries, a school of art of the automotive engineering college Institut sup√©rieur de l'automobile et des transports. The town manufactures porcelain, agricultural implements, chemical manures, glue, boilers and iron goods, boots and shoes and fur garments, and has distilleries, tanneries and dye works. Its trade is in iron and steel, wood, wine, grain, livestock, etc. hydraulic lime, kaolin and clay for the manufacture of faience are worked in the vicinity. =Transport= The Gare de Nevers railway station offers connections to Paris, Dijon, Lyon, Clermont-Ferrand and several regional destinations. The A77 motorway connects Nevers with Paris.

It was common in much of Europe. The system of appanage greatly influenced the territorial construction of France and the German states and explains why many of the former provinces of France had coats of arms which were modified versions of the king's arms. Etymology Late Latin *appanaticum, from appanare or adpanare 'to give bread' (panis), a pars pro toto for food and other necessities, hence for a \\"subsistence\\" income, notably in kind, as from assigned land. Original appanage: in France =History of the French appanage = An appanage was a concession of a fief by the sovereign to his younger sons, while the eldest son became king on the death of his father. Appanages were considered as part of the inheritance transmitted to the pu√Æsn√© (French puis, \\"later\\", + n√©, \\"born [masc.]\\") sons; the word Juveigneur (from the Latin comparative iuvenior, 'younger [masc.]'; in Brittany's customary law only the youngest brother) was specifically used for the royal princes holding an appanage. These lands could not be sold, neither hypothetically nor as a dowry, and returned to the royal domain on the extinction of the princely line. Daughters were excluded from the system: Salic law then generally prohibited daughters from inheriting land and also from acceding to the throne. The system of appanage has played a particularly important role in France. It developed there with the extension of royal authority from the 13th century, then disappeared from the late Middle Ages with the affirmation of the exclusive authority of the royal state. It strongly influenced the territorial construction, explaining the arms of several provinces. The prerogative of Burgundy is also the origin of the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch States, through the action of its dukes favored by their position in the court of the kings of France. Appanages were used to sweeten the pill of the primogeniture. It has traditionally been used to prevent the revolt of younger sons who would otherwise have no inheritance, while avoiding the weakening of the kingdom by equal division. Indeed, according to Frankish custom, the inheritance was to be divided among the surviving sons. The kingdom was considered family property, and so many divisions occurred under the Merovingians (the first following the death of Clovis I in 511), and later under the rule of the Carolingians in which the Treaty of Verdun of 843 gave birth to independent territories. The consequences of equal division (dismemberment of the kingdom, civil wars, conflicts between heirs, etc.) led to the adoption of the appanage system, which has the advantage of diverting the claim of younger sons to the crown, which was the inheritance of the eldest. In addition, over time, the system guarantees the unity of the royal domain to the senior heir. Hugh Capet was elected King of the Franks on the death of Louis V in 987. The Capetian dynasty broke away from the Frankish custom of dividing the kingdom among all the sons. The eldest son alone became King and received the royal domain except for the appanages. Unlike their predecessors, their hold on the crown was initially tenuous. They could not afford to divide the kingdom among all their sons, and the royal domain (the territory directly controlled by the king) was very small, initially consisting solely of the √éle-de-France. Most of the Capetians endeavored to add to the royal domain by the incorporation of additional fiefs, large or small, and thus gradually obtained the direct lordship over almost all of France. The first king to create an appanage is Henry I of France in 1032, when he gave the Duchy of Burgundy to his brother Robert, Robert I of Burgundy, whose descendants retained the duchy until 1361 with the extinction of the first Capetian House of Burgundy by the death of Philip de Rouvres. Louis VIII and Louis IX also created appanages. The king who created the most powerful appanages for his sons was John II of France. His youngest son, Philip the Bold, founded the second Capetian House of Burgundy in 1363. By marrying the heiress of Flanders, Philip also became ruler of the Low Countries. King Charles V tried to remove the appanage system, but in vain. Provinces conceded in appanage tended to become de facto independent and the authority of the king was recognized there reluctantly. In particular the line of Valois Dukes of Burgundy caused considerable trouble to the French crown, with which they were often at war, often in open alliance with the English. Theoretically appanages could be reincorporated into the royal domain but only if the last lord had no male heirs. Kings tried as much as possible to rid themselves of the most powerful appanages. Louis XI retook the Duchy of Burgundy at the death of its last duke, Charles the Bold. Francis I confiscated the Bourbonnais, after the treason in 1523 of his commander in chief, Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, the 'constable of Bourbon' (died 1527 in the service of Emperor Charles V). The first article of the Edict of Moulins (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. The apanagist (incumbent) therefore could not separate himself from his appanage in any way. After Charles V of France, a clear distinction had to be made between titles given as names to children in France, and true appanages. At their birth the French princes received a title independent of an appanage. Thus, the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV, never possessed Anjou and never received any revenue from this province. The king waited until the prince had reached adulthood and was about to marry before endowing him with an appanage. The goal of the appanage was to provide him with a sufficient income to maintain his noble rank. The fief given in appanage could be the same as the title given to the prince, but this was not necessarily the case. Only seven appanages were given from 1515 to 1789. Appanages were abolished in 1792 before the proclamation of the Republic. The youngest princes from then on were to receive a grant of money but no territory. Appanages were reestablished under the first French empire by Napoleon Bonaparte and confirmed by the Bourbon restoration-king Louis XVIII. The last of the appanages, the Orl√©anais, was reincorporated to the French crown when the Duke of Orl√©ans, Louis-Philippe, became king of the French in 1830. The word apanage is still used in French figuratively, in a non-historic sense: \\"to have appanage over something\\" is used, often in an ironic and negative sense, to claim exclusive possession over something. For example, \\"cows have appanage over prions.\\" = List of major French appanages =  Direct Capetians  *Henry I gave the Duchy of Burgundy to his brother Robert. *Louis VI gave the County of Dreux to his son Robert. The lineage of the counts became extinct in 1355, but a cadet line, descended from Pierre Mauclerc, became Dukes of Brittany. *Philip II gave his son Philippe Hurepel the county of Clermont, then the counties of Domfront and Mortain. *Louis VIII, by his 1225 will, granted **the County of Artois to his second son Robert. Artois was lost by Robert's male heirs, passing through a female line, and eventually was inherited by the Dukes of Burgundy. Louis XI seized it upon the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, but his son returned it to Charles's heirs in preparation for his invasion of Italy in 1493. **the Counties of Poitou and Auvergne to his fourth son Alphonse. These returned to the crown when Alphonse died without heirs in 1271. **the Counties of Anjou and Maine to his third son John. They returned to the crown when John died without heirs in 1232. *Louis IX endowed **the Counties of Anjou and Maine (1246) to his youngest brother, Charles. They passed to Charles's granddaughter, who married Charles, Count of Valois, the younger son of Philip III, and thence to their son, Philip. When Philip inherited the throne as Philip VI, the lands reverted to the crown. **the County of Orl√©ans to his eldest son, Philip. It returned to the crown when he succeeded his father in 1270 as Philip III. **the County of Valois (ca. 1268) to his second son, Jean Tristan. This title became extinct upon Jean Tristan's death in 1270. **the Counties of Alen√ßon and Perche (1268) to his third son, Pierre. This title became extinct on Pierre's death in 1284. **the County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis (1269) to his fourth son, Robert. Robert's son, Louis, was later given the Duchy of Bourbon, which was treated as an appanage, although it was not technically one. Louis later traded Clermont for La Marche with his cousin Charles, Count of Angoul√™me, younger brother of King Philip V. These appanages remained in the Bourbon family until they were confiscated due to the treason of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon in 1527. *Philip III granted **the County of Valois to his second son Charles. Charles was later given the Counties of Alen√ßon, Perche, and Chartres by his brother, Philip IV of France. Valois passed to Charles's eldest son, Philip upon his death in 1325, and returned to the crown when Philip became King Philip VI in 1328. Alen√ßon and Perche passed to Charles's younger son, Charles. A descendant was raised to the dignity of Duke of Alen√ßon. These titles returned to the crown upon the extinction of the Alen√ßon line in 1525. **the County of Beaumont-sur-Oise to his third son Louis. Louis was later given the County of √âvreux by his brother Philip IV. These titles returned to the throne upon the death of Queen Blanche of Navarre in 1441. *Philip IV endowed **the County of Poitou for his second son, Philip. This title returned to the throne when Philip became king in 1316. **the Counties of La Marche and Angoul√™me for his third son, Charles IV. Charles later traded La Marche for the County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis with the Duke of Bourbon. His titles returned to the throne when Charles became king in 1322.  House of Valois  *Philip VI endowed **the Duchy of Normandy for his elder son John. This title returned to the throne when John succeeded his father in 1350. **the Duchy of Orl√©ans for his younger son Philip. This title returned to the throne when Philip died without issue in 1375. *John II the Good, on his departure to England in 1360, granted **the Duchies of Anjou and of Maine to his second son Louis. This title returned to the throne upon the death of duke Charles IV, Louis I's great-grandson, in 1481. **the Duchies of Berry and of Auvergne to his third son John. These titles returned to the throne upon John's death without male issue in 1416. **In 1363, John II granted the Duchy of Burgundy to his fourth son Philip. Upon the death of Philip's great-grandson Charles the Bold in 1477, King Louis XI claimed the reversion of Burgundy and seized the territory. It continued to be claimed, however, by Charles's daughter Mary and her heirs. When Mary's grandson Emperor Charles V defeated and captured Francis I at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, he forced Francis to sign a treaty recognizing him as Duke of Burgundy, but Francis disavowed the treaty when he was released, and the cession was revoked by the Treaty of Cambrai four years later. Charles and his heirs reserved their claims, however, and this reservation was repeated as late as the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, when Philip IV of Spain continued to reserve his rights to the Duchy. *Charles VI granted the Duchy of Orl√©ans and the County of Angoul√™me to his brother Louis in 1392. The Duchy of Orl√©ans returned to the crown when Louis I's grandson became Louis XII of France in 1498. The County of Angoul√™me returned to the crown when Louis I's great-grandson became Francis I of France in 1515. *Louis XI granted the Duchies of Berry, Normandy, and Guyenne to his younger brother Charles. These titles returned to the crown when Charles died in 1472. *Francis I granted the Duchies of Orl√©ans, Angoul√™me, and Ch√¢tellerault and the Counties of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis and La Marche to his second surviving son, Charles in 1540. To this was added the Duchy of Bourbon in 1544. These titles returned to the crown when Charles died without issue in 1545. *Charles IX granted **the Duchies of Anjou and Bourbonnais and the County of Forez to the older of his two brothers, Henry, in 1566. He added the Duchy of Auvergne to these holdings in 1569. The titles returned to the crown when Henry succeeded his brother in 1574. **the Duchies of Alen√ßon and Ch√¢teau-Thierry and the Counties of Perche, Mantes, and Meulan to his youngest brother, Francis in 1566. To this he later added the Duchy of √âvreux and the County of Dreux in 1569. Francis's other brother, Henry III, increased his holdings still further in 1576, granting him the Duchies of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry and the County of Maine. All these titles returned to the crown upon Francis's death without issue in 1584.  House of Bourbon  *Louis XIII granted the Duchies of Orl√©ans and Chartres and the County of Blois to his younger brother Gaston in 1626. To this was added the Duchy of Valois in 1630. These titles returned to the crown on Gaston's death without male issue in 1660. *Louis XIV granted **the Duchies of Orl√©ans, Chartres, and Valois to his brother, Philippe in 1661. To this was added the Duchy of Nemours in 1672. These titles passed to his descendants and were abolished during the Revolution in 1790. They were restored to the heir at the time of the Restoration in 1814. At the accession of Louis Philippe, these titles merged into the crown. **the Duchies of Alen√ßon and Angoul√™me and the County of Ponthieu to his third grandson, Charles, duc de Berry in 1710. These titles returned to the crown upon his death without surviving issue in 1714 *Louis XV granted **the Duchy of Anjou and the Counties of Maine, Perche, and Senonches to his second surviving grandson, Louis Stanislas, comte de Provence in 1771. Louis was further given the Duchy of Alen√ßon by his brother Louis XVI in 1774. These titles were abolished during the Revolution in 1790. When the monarchy and apanages were restored in 1814, Louis had inherited the throne as Louis XVIII, and his titles merged into the crown. **the Duchies of Auvergne, Angoul√™me and Merc≈ìur and the Viscounty of Limoges to his youngest grandson Charles, comte d'Artois in 1773. To this was added in 1774 by his brother, Louis XVI the Marquisate of Pompadour and the Viscounty of Turenne. In 1776, Louis XVI deprived Charles of Limoges, Pompadour, and Turenne, and gave him in exchange the Duchies of Berry and Ch√¢teauroux, the Counties of Argenton and Ponthieu, and the Lordship of Henrichemont. In 1778, the apanage was further reshaped, with Auvergne and Merc≈ìur removed and replaced with the County of Poitou, leaving Charles with a final apanage consisting of the Duchies of Angoul√™me, Berry, and Ch√¢teauroux, the Counties of Argenton, Ponthieu, and Poitou, and the Lordship of Henrichemont. These titles were abolished during the Revolution in 1790, but were restored at the time of the Restoration in 1814. They merged into the crown when Charles became king in 1824. Although Napoleon restored the idea of apanage in 1810 for his sons, none were ever granted, nor were any new apanages created by the restoration monarchs. Western feudal appanages outside France =Appanages within Britain= English and British monarchs frequently granted appanages to younger sons of the monarch. Most famously, the Houses of York and Lancaster, whose feuding over the succession to the English throne after the end of the main line of the House of Plantagenet caused the Wars of the Roses, were both established when the Duchies of York and Lancaster were given as appanages for Edmund of Langley and John of Gaunt, the younger sons of King Edward III. In modern times, the Duchy of Cornwall is the permanent statutory appanage of the monarch's eldest son, intended to support him until such time as he inherits the Crown. Other titles have continued to be granted to junior members of the royal family, but without associated grants of land directly connected with those titles, any territorial rights over the places named in the titles, or any income directly derived from those lands or places by virtue of those titles. Scotland The defunct Kingdom of Strathclyde was granted as an appanage to the future David I of Scotland by his brother Edgar, King of Scots. Remnants of this can be found within the patrimony of the Prince of Scotland, currently Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay. =Kingdom of Jerusalem= In the only crusader state of equal rank in protocol to the states of Western Europe, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the County of Jaffa and Ascalon was often granted as an appanage. =Brigantine Portugal= With the installation of the House of Braganza on the Portuguese throne in 1640, an official appanage was created for the second eldest son of the monarch, the House of the Infantado. The Infantado included several land grants and palaces, along with a heightened royal pension. Equivalents outside Western Europe The practice is certainly not unique to western feudalism * The principalities of European Russia had a similar practice; an appanage given to a younger male of the royal family was called an udel. The frequency and importance of the custom was particularly important between the mid-13th and the mid-15th centuries; some historians refer to this era as \\"the appanage period\\". * In Medieval Serbia, an appanage was predominantly given to a younger brother of the supreme ruler, called a ≈Ωupa. Its use began in the 9th century and continued into the 14th century, with the fall of the Serbian Empire. * In the Indian subcontinent, the jagir (a type of fief) was often thus assigned to individual junior relatives of the ruling house of a princely state, but not as a customary right of birth, though in practice usually hereditarily held, and not only to them but also to commoners, normally as an essentially meritocratic grant of land and taxation rights (guaranteeing a \\"fitting\\" income, in itself bringing social sway, in the primary way in a mainly agricultural society), or even as part of a deal. *The seniormost female in the Travancore royal family held the estate of Attingal, also known as the Sreepadam Estate in appanage for life. All the income derived from this estate was the private property of the senior maharani, alternatively known as the Senior Rani of Attingal (Attingal Mootha Thampuran). *The Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, which dominated eastern Java in the 14th and 15th centuries, was divided into nagara (provinces). The administration of these nagara was entrusted to members of the royal family, who bore the title of Bhre i. e. Bhra i, \\"lord of\\" (the word bhra being akin to the Thai Phra), followed by the name of the land they were entrusted with: for example a sister of king Hayam Wuruk (r. 1350-1389) was \\"Bhre Lasem\\", \\"lady of Lasem\\". =Appanage system of the Mongol Empire and Mongolian monarchs= The royal family of the Mongol Empire owned the largest appanages in the world because of their enormous empire. In 1206, Genghis Khan awarded large tracts of land to his family members and loyal companions, most of whom were of common origin. Shares of booty were distributed much more widely. Empresses, princesses, and meritorious servants, as well as children of concubines, all received full shares including war prisoners.Weatherford, Jack. Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world, pp. 220-227. For example, Kublai summoned two siege engineers from the Ilkhanate, and after their success rewarded them with lands. After the Mongol conquest in 1238, the port cities in Crimea paid the Jochids custom duties and the revenues were divided among all Chingisid princes in Mongol Empire in accordance with the appanage system.Jackson, Peter. Dissolution of Mongol Empire, pp. 186-243. As loyal allies, the Kublaids in East Asia and the Ilkhanids in Persia sent clerics, doctors, artisans, scholars, engineers and administrators to and received revenues from the appanages in each other's khanates. The Great Khan M√∂ngke divided up shares or appanages in Persia and made redistribution in Central Asia in 1251-1256.Ren√© Grousset The Empire of Steppes, p. 286. Although the Chagatai Khanate was the smallest in size, the Chagatai Khans held the cities of Kat and Khiva in Khorazm, and some cities and villages in Shanxi and Iran, as well as their nomadic grounds in Central Asia. The first Ilkhan, Hulagu, owned 25,000 households of silk-workers in China, valleys in Tibet, and lands in Mongolia. In 1298, his descendant Ghazan of Persia sent envoys with precious gifts to the Great Khan Tem√ºr Khan, and asked for the share of lands and revenues held by his great-grandfather in the Yuan lands (China and Mongolia). It is claimed that Ghazan received revenues that were not sent since the time of M√∂ngke Khan.Jackson, Peter. \\"From Ulus to Khanate: the making of Mongol States, c. 1220-1290\\" in The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy, pp. 12-38. The appanage holders demanded excessive revenues and freed themselves from taxes. √ñgedei decreed that nobles could appoint darughachi and judges in the appanages instead of direct distribution without the permission of the Great Khan, thanks to the brilliant Khitan minister Yel√º Chucai. Both G√ºy√ºk and M√∂ngke restricted the autonomy of the appanages, but Kublai Khan continued √ñgedei's regulations. Ghazan also prohibited any misfeasance of appanage holders in the Ilkhanate, and Yuan councillor Temuder restricted Mongol nobles' excessive powers in appanages in China and Mongolia.Cambridge History of China Kublai's successor Tem√ºr abolished imperial son-in-law King Chungnyeol of Goryeo's 358 departments which caused financial pressures to Korean people, though, Mongols gave them some autonomy.The history of Gaoli Chongson The appanage system was severely affected beginning with the civil strife in the Mongol Empire from 1260 to 1304.Atwood, Christopher P. Encyclopedia of the Mongol Empire and Mongolia, p. 32. Nevertheless, this system survived. For example, Abagha of the Ilkhanate allowed M√∂ngke Tem√ºr of the Golden Horde to collect revenues from silk workshops in northern Persia in 1270, and Baraq of the Chagatai Khanate sent his Muslim vizier to the Ilkhanate in 1269, ostensibly to investigate his appanages there. (The vizier's real mission was to spy on the Ilkhanids.)A COMPENDIUM OF CHRONICLES: Rashid al-Din's Illustrated History of the World (The Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, VOL XXVII) or Reuven Amitai-Preiss (1995), Mongols and Mamluks: The Mamluk-ƒ™lkhƒÅnid War, 1260‚Äì1281, pp. 179-225. Cambridge University Press, . After a peace treaty declared among Mongol Khans: Tem√ºr, Duwa, Chapar, Tokhta and Oljeitu in 1304, the system began to see a recovery. During the reign of Tugh Tem√ºr, Yuan court received a third of revenues of the cities of Transoxiana (Mawarannahr) under Chagatai Khans while Chagatai elites such as Eljigidey, Duwa Tem√ºr, Tarmashirin were given lavish presents and sharing in the Yuan Dynasty's patronage of Buddhist temples.W. Barthold \\"Chagatay Khanate\\" in Encyclopedia of Islam 2nd ed., 3-4; Kazuhide Kato Kebek and Yasawr: the establishment of Chagatai Khanate 97-118 Tugh Tem√ºr was also given some Russian captives by Chagatai prince Changshi as well as Kublai's future khatun Chabi had servant Ahmad Fanakati from Fergana Valley before her marriage.Handbuch Der Orientalistik By Agust√≠ Alemany, Denis Sinor, Bertold Spuler, Hartwig Altenm√ºller, pp. 391-408, Encyclopedia of Mongolia and Mongol Empire \\"Ahmad Fanakati\\" In 1326, Golden Horde started sending tributes to Great Khans of Yuan Dynasty again. By 1339, Ozbeg and his successors had received annually 24 thousand ding in paper currency from their Chinese appanages in Shanxi, Cheli and Hunan.Thomas T. Allsen Sharing out the Empire 172-190 H. H. Howorth noted that Ozbeg's envoy required his master's shares from the Yuan court, the headquarters of the Mongol world, for the establishment of new post stations in 1336.H. H. Howorth History of the Mongols, Vol II, p. 172. This communication ceased only with the breakup, succession struggles and rebellions of Mongol Khanates. After the fall of the Mongol Empire in 1368, the Mongols continued the tradition of appanage system. They were divided into districts ruled by hereditary noblemen.

The term bureaucrat derives from \\"bureaucracy\\", which in turn derives from the French \\"bureaucratie\\" first known from the 18th century. Bureaucratic work had already been performed for many centuries. In countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, bureaucrats are known to be the officials that run the government sector at administrative levels as well as ministerial levels and also they are known as executives that run the corporate sector at managerial and directorial level . Role in society Bureaucrats play various roles in modern society, by virtue of holding administrative, functional, and managerial positions in government. They carry out the day-to-day implementation of enacted policies for central government agencies, such as postal services, education and healthcare administration, and various regulatory bodies. Types of bureaucrats Bureaucrats can be split into different categories based on the system, nationality, and time they come from. # Classical ‚Äì someone who starts at a low level of public work and does not have to express opinions of their own in their professional capacities. They follow policy guidelines and gain increasing ranks within the system. Tax collectors, government accountants, police officers, fire fighters, and military personnel are examples of classical bureaucrats. # American bureaucrats ‚Äì these are different from other types because they operate within a republican form of government, and the political culture traditionally seeks to limit their power. # Chinese bureaucrats, also called ‚ÄúMandarin bureaucrats‚Äù ‚Äì Mandarins were important from 605 to 1905 CE. The Zhou dynasty is the earliest recording of Chinese bureaucrats. There was a 9 rank system, each rank having more power than the lower rank. This type of bureaucrat went on until the Qing dynasty. After 1905, the Mandarins were replaced by modern civil servants. In 1949, the Communist Party took over China, and by their theory, all people were bureaucrats who worked for the government. # European ‚Äì originally referred to as ‚ÄúMandarins‚Äù stemming from the Chinese word for government employee. Bureaucracy didn't catch on in Europe very much due to the many different governments in the region, and constant change and advancement, and relative freedom of the upper class. With the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ancien regime of Europe.Schwarz, Bill. (1996). The expansion of England: race, ethnicity and cultural history. Psychology Pres; . Voltaire and Fran√ßois Quesnay wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had \\"perfected moral science\\" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese. The implementation of Her Majesty's Civil Service as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy, followed the Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan Report of 1854 which was influenced by of the ancient Chinese imperial examination. This system was modeled on the imperial examinations system and bureaucracy of China based on the suggestion of Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan Report. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou, China argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China, published in 1847, that \\"the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only,\\" and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. In 1958, though, after the formation of the European Union the job of the Bureaucrat became extremely important to help organize and govern such a large and diverse community. In 1961 the term Eurocrat was coined by Richard Mayne, a journalist at the time. A Eurocrat is a bureaucrat of the European Union. # Modern Bureaucrat - Bureaucrats gained increasingly negative reputations throughout the second half of the 20th century. As populations grow it becomes harder for bureaucratic systems to work because it often involves a lot of paperwork, which increases processing times, which eventually will be nearly impossible to manage. The digital age and the Internet has revolutionized Bureaucrats and the modern Bureaucrat has a different skill set than before. Also, the internet lowers the corruption levels of some Bureaucratic entities such as the Police Force due to social media and pro‚Äìam journalism. Attributes of bureaucrats German sociologist Max Weber defined a bureaucratic official as the following: * They are personally free and appointed to their position on the basis of conduct. * They exercise the authority delegated to them in accordance with impersonal rules, and their loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of their official duties. * Their appointment and job placement are dependent upon their technical qualifications. * Their administrative work is a full-time occupation. * Their work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career. * They must exercise their judgment and their skills, but their duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority. Ultimately they are responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice their personal judgment if it runs counter to their official duties. * Bureaucratic control is the use of rules, regulations, and formal authority to guide performance. It includes such things as budgets, statistical reports, and performance appraisals to regulate behavior and results.

He finished his fighter career in 1941 with 27 destroyed, 7 shared destroyed and 2 unconfirmed, 3 probables and 16 damaged. At the time he was the RAF's leading ace, and one of the highest scoring pilots to have served wholly with Fighter Command during the Second World War. After the war, Malan became leader of the Torch Commando, a liberal anti-authoritarian organisation that opposed the introduction of the apartheid system. Early life Malan was born on 24 March 1910 to an Afrikaner family of Huguenot descent in Wellington, Western Cape, then part of the Cape Colony. He joined the South African Training Ship General Botha in 1924 or 1925 as a naval cadet (cadet number 168) at the age of 14, and on 5 January 1928 engaged as an officer cadet (seaman's discharge number R42512) aboard the Landsdown CastleCR1 record card, R42512, record group BT348, The National Archives (London) of the Union- Castle Line of the International Mercantile Marine Co. which later earned him the nickname of \\"Sailor\\" amongst his pilot colleagues. On 19 February 1932, he joined the Royal Naval Reserve as an acting sub-lieutenant, and was commissioned a sub-lieutenant on 18 June 1935. Royal Air Force In 1935 the Royal Air Force (RAF) started the rapid expansion of its pilot corps, for which Malan volunteered. He learned to fly in the de Havilland Tiger Moth at an elementary flying school near Bristol, flying for the first time on 6 January 1936. Commissioned an acting pilot officer on 2 March, he completed training by the end of the year, and was sent to join 74 Squadron on 20 December 1936. He was confirmed as a pilot officer on 6 January 1937,. He was promoted to acting flying officer on 20 May 1938 and promoted to substantive flying officer on 6 July. He received another promotion to acting flight lieutenant on 2 March 1939, six months before the outbreak of war. Second World War =Battle of Barking Creek= Malan in the cockpit of his Supermarine Spitfire at Biggin Hill, Kent. No. 74 Squadron saw its first action only 15 hours after war was declared, sent to intercept a bomber raid that turned out to be returning RAF planes. On 6 September 1939, \\"A\\" Flight was scrambled to intercept a suspected enemy radar track and ran into the Hurricanes of No. 56 Squadron RAF. Believing 56 to be the enemy, Malan ordered an attack. Paddy Byrne and John Freeborn downed two RAF aircraft, killing one officer, Montague Hulton-Harrop, in this friendly fire incident, which became known as the Battle of Barking Creek. At the subsequent courts-martial, Malan denied responsibility for the attack. He testified for the prosecution against his own pilots stating that Freeborn had been irresponsible, impetuous, and had not taken proper heed of vital communications. This prompted Freeborn's counsel, Sir Patrick Hastings to call Malan a bare-faced liar. Hastings was assisted in defending the pilots by Roger Bushell, who, like Malan, had been born in South Africa. A London barrister and RAF Auxiliary pilot, Bushell later led the Great Escape from Stalag Luft III. The court ruled the entire incident was an unfortunate error and acquitted both pilots. =Dunkirk= After fierce fighting over Dunkirk during the evacuation of the British Army from Dunkirk on 28 May 1940, Malan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross having achieved five 'kills'. During this battle he first exhibited his fearless and implacable fighting spirit. In one incident he was able to coolly change the light bulb in his gunsight while in combat and then quickly return to the fray. During the night of 19/20 June Malan flew a night sortie in bright moonlight and shot down two Heinkel He 111 bombers, a then unique feat for which a bar to his DFC was awarded. On 6 July, he was promoted to the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. Malan and his senior pilots also decided to abandon the \\"vic\\" formation used by the RAF, and turned to a looser formation (the \\"finger-four\\") similar to the four aircraft Schwarm the Luftwaffe had developed during the Spanish Civil War. Legend has it that on 28 July he met Werner M√∂lders in combat, damaging his plane and wounding him, but failing to bring him down. Recent research has suggested however that M√∂lders was wounded in a fight with No. 41 Squadron RAF. =Squadron leader of No. 74 Squadron= On 8 August, Malan was given command of 74 Squadron and promoted to acting squadron leader. This was at the height of the Battle of Britain. Three days later, on 11 August, action started at 7 am when 74 was sent to intercept a raid near Dover, but this was followed by another three raids, lasting all day. At the end of the day, 74 had claimed to have shot down 38 aircraft, and was known from then on as \\"Sailor's August the Eleventh\\". Malan himself simply commented, \\"thus ended a very successful morning of combat.\\" He received a bar to his DFC on 13 August. On the ground, Malan earned a reputation as an inveterate gambler who often owed his subordinates money. Malan was older than most of his charges and although sociable and relaxed off-duty, he spent most of his time with his wife and family living near Biggin Hill. He soon developed a flying routine of leading the first sortie of the day, then handing the squadron to a subordinate while he stayed on the ground to perform the Squadron commander's administration. Despite frosty relations after the Battle of Barking Creek he would often give command of the squadron to John Freeborn (himself an ace), showing Malan's ability to keep the personal and professional separate. Malan commanded 74 Squadron with strict discipline and did not suffer fools gladly, and could be high-handed with sergeant pilots (many non-commissioned pilots were joining the RAF at this time). He could also be reluctant to hand out decorations, and he had a hard-and-fast yardstick via which he would make recommendations for medals: six kills confirmed for a Distinguished Flying Cross, twelve for a bar to the DFC; eighteen for a Distinguished Service Order. Sailor Malan, colour oil painting by Cuthbert Orde On 29 December 1941 Malan was added to the select list of airmen who had sat for one of Cuthbert Orde's iconic RAF charcoal portraits. He had the rarer honour of also being the subject of a full colour painting by Orde. =Wing commander ‚Äì Biggin Hill= On 24 December, Malan received the Distinguished Service Order, and on 22 July 1941, a bar to the Order. On 10 March 1941 he was appointed as one of the first wing leaders for the offensive operations that spring and summer, leading the Biggin Hill Wing until mid-August, when he was rested from operations. He finished his active fighter career in 1941 with 27 kills destroyed, 7 shared destroyed and 2 unconfirmed, 3 probables and 16 damaged, at the time the RAF's leading ace, and one of the highest scoring pilots to have served wholly with Fighter Command during World War II. He was transferred to the reserve as a squadron leader on 6 January 1942. After tours to the US and the Central Gunnery School, Malan was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 September 1942 and became station commander at Biggin Hill, receiving a promotion to war substantive wing commander on 1 July 1943. Malan remained keen to fly on operations, often ignoring standing orders for station commanders not to risk getting shot down. In October 1943 he became officer commanding No. 19 Fighter Wing, RAF Second Tactical Air Force, then commander of the No. 145 (Free French) Wing in time for D-day, leading a section of the wing over the beaches during the late afternoon. Malan (second from left), RAF and Free French officers on D-Day Rules of air fighting Although not an instinctive pilot Malan was an exceptional shot and a highly aggressive fighter-pilot, and above all a superb tactician who instilled the methods and techniques he had honed in 1940, which would cast an influence on successive generations of RAF fighter pilots who followed after him. He developed a set of clear rules for fighter-pilots (similar to those of Mick Mannock in the First World War), which was disseminated throughout RAF Fighter Command, and which during the latter part of the war could be found tacked to the wall of most airfield's Orderly Rooms: Ten of My Rules For Air Fighting # Wait until you see the whites of his eyes. Fire short bursts of one to two seconds only when your sights are definitely \\"ON\\". # Whilst shooting think of nothing else, brace the whole of your body: have both hands on the stick: concentrate on your ring sight. # Always keep a sharp lookout. \\"Keep your finger out\\". # Height gives you the initiative. # Always turn and face the attack. # Make your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best. # Never fly straight and level for more than 30 seconds in the combat area. # When diving to attack always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as a top guard. # Initiative, Aggression, Air Discipline, and Teamwork are words that Mean something in Air Fighting. # Go in quickly ‚Äì Punch hard ‚Äì Get out! Post-war opposition to Apartheid After the victorious conclusion of World War 2 Malan resigned his commission with the Royal Air Force in April 1946, retaining the rank of Group Captain, and returned home to South Africa, where he commenced a career in sheep farming.'A Flying Springbok of Wartime British Skies: A.G. Sailor Malan', Kronos Magazine, November 2009. http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid;=S0259-01902009000100004 In the early 1950s he became involved in the increasingly febrile South African domestic political scene, with its radical polarizing atmosphere and racially and culturally divided societal tensions. After the National Party was voted into Government in the late 1940s South Africa's domestic governance moved to a position of National Conservatism, and commenced the introduction Apartheid, a system of organised racial segregation, which Malan objected to. In the early 1950s in response Malan joined a Liberal politically organized protest movement opposed to the introduction of the Apartheid System styling itself as the \\"Torch Commando\\", which - with his public recognition acquired from his glamourous war career - to the Presidency of which he was elected. Through the early 1950s he involved himself in political opposition to what he perceived was the increasing authoritarianism of the National Party in Government, which he felt threatened to become fascist in nature. At one point the \\"Torch Commando\\" (so-called for its predilection for staging night-time rallies outside government buildings with the protestors bearing flaming torches for dramatic illumination) movement had 250,000 members, and staged well-attended rallies across South Africa, which Malan often publicly addressed.Newsreel footage of \\"Torch Commando\\" campaigning in 1953. Associated Press Archive newsreel from 1953 on 'British Movietone' Youtube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW8gNsq5_n8 By the late 1950s however the movement lost momentum as some of the factions that constituted it increasingly moved from a hitherto public Liberal position to one of World Communism, and splintered away to join the newly insurgent African National Congress, with which Malan was not sympathetic.'The Torch Commando', article on its history on the 'Observation Post - South African Contemporary Military History' website. 10 November 2017. http://www.samilhistory.com/tag/torch- commando/ The rise of the A.N.C. with its ideological radical agenda in turn discouraged the majority of the \\"Torch Commando's\\" membership from continuing with their campaign against the Apartheid State laws, with Malan leaving the disintegrating organization and retiring from politics and public life, leaving the National Party to rule South Africa exclusively for the next four decades.'Sailor Malan - Freedom Fighter', South African Legion (United Kingdom & Europe) website. http://www.salegion.org.uk/torch-commando/ Death Malan died at the age of 53 on 17 September 1963 from Parkinson's disease, at that time a rare and little understood medical condition.

As diplomat, he served as the U.S. minister to China (1862-1867) and then as China's envoy to the U.S., which resulted in the 1868 landmark Burlingame Treaty. Early life Burlingame was born in New Berlin, Chenango County, New York. In 1823 his parents (Joel Burlingame and Freelove Angell) took him to Ohio, and about ten years afterwards to Michigan. Between 1838 and 1841 he studied at the Detroit branch of the University of Michigan, and in 1846 graduated from Harvard Law School. On June 3, 1847, he married Jane Cornelia Livermore. They had sons Edward Livermore Burlingame (born 1848) and Walter Angell Burlingame (born 1852), as well as a daughter Gertrude Burlingame (born 1856).  Early career  Burlingame practiced law in Boston, Massachusetts, and won a wide reputation by his speeches for the Free Soil Party in 1848. He was a member of the Massachusetts constitutional convention in 1853, of the state senate from 1853 to 1854, and of the United States House of Representatives from 1855 to 1861, being elected for the first term as a Know Nothing and afterwards as a member of the new Republican Party, which he helped to organize in Massachusetts. He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Sigma chapter).  Burlingame vs. Preston Brooks  In May 1856, Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts delivered a vituperative denunciation of President Franklin Pierce and Southerners who sympathized with the pro-slavery violence in Bleeding Kansas. In particular, Sumner lambasted Senator Andrew Butler, a cousin of Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina. Three days later, Congressman Brooks advanced upon Sumner while he worked at his desk in the Senate chamber. Using his cane, Brooks beat Sumner into unconsciousness, with Sumner ripping his bolted-down desk from the floor as he attempted to escape. Brooks received no official censure from the House of Representatives, and was instead hailed as a hero in much of the pro- slavery South.John Schrecker, \\"'For the Equality of Men -- for the Equality of Nations': Anson Burlingame and China's First Embassy to the United States, 1868,\\" Journal of American-East Asian Relations 17.1 (2010): 10. Shortly afterwards, Burlingame delivered what The New York Times referred to as \\"the most celebrated speech\\"The New York Times, February 24, 1870, pg.5 of his career: a scathing denunciation of Brooks' assault on Sumner, branding him as \\"the vilest sort of coward\\" on the House floor. In response, Brooks challenged Burlingame to a duel, stating he would gladly face him \\"in any Yankee mudsill of his choosing\\". Burlingame eagerly accepted; as the challenged party, he had his choice of weapons and location. A well-known marksman, he selected rifles as the weapons and the Navy Yard on the Canadian side of the U.S. border in Niagara Falls as the location (in order to circumvent the U.S. ban on dueling). Brooks, reportedly dismayed by both Burlingame's unexpectedly enthusiastic acceptance and his reputation as a crack shot, neglected to show up, instead citing unspecified risks to his safety if he were to cross \\"hostile country\\" (the northern U.S. states) in order to reach Canada.\\"The Beginnings of the Burlingame Mission\\", Walsh, Warren B., The Far Eastern Quarterly, Vol. 4.3 (May 1945): 274-277 Burlingame's solid defense of a fellow Bostonian greatly raised his stature throughout the North.Schrecker, \\"'For the Equality of Men -- for the Equality of Nations'\\": 10.  Diplomatic posts  Burlingame was given this Daimyo Oak bonsai when he passed through Japan during his return to the U.S. It is on display at the Gardens of Lake Merritt, Oakland, California. =Minister to China (Qing Empire)= On March 22, 1861, after Burlingame lost his bid for re-election, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Burlingame as Minister to the Austrian Empire, but Burlingame, who had championed the Hungarian Lajos Kossuth and his drive for independence from the Austrian Empire, was not acceptable and did not serve.Williams, Anson Burlingame, On June 14, 1861, Lincoln instead appointed Burlingame as minister to the Qing Empire. Burlingame worked for a cooperative policy rather than the imperialistic policies of force which had been used during the First and Second Opium Wars and developed relations with the reform elements of the court. As he put it, the \\"cooperative policy... substituted for the old doctrine of violence one of fair diplomatic action,\\" and the representatives of the Western powers agreed that they would not interfere in the internal affairs of China. Burlingame reported that he had used his diplomacy to get the European powers to agree that they would \\"give to the treaties a fair and Christian construction; that they ... never would menace the territorial integrity of China.\\" Schrecker, \\"'For the Equality of Men -- for the Equality of Nations',\\" 11. =China's envoy to U.S. and European nations= The success of this diplomacy was not lost on Qing dynasty court officials. On November 16, 1867, when he was set to retire and return to his political career at home, the Chinese government appointed Burlingame envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to head a Chinese diplomatic mission to the United States and the principal European nations. The mission, which included two Chinese ministers, an English and a French secretary, six students from Peking, and a considerable retinue, arrived in the United States in March 1868. Burlingame used his personal relations with the Republican administration to negotiate a relatively quick and favorable treaty. In a series of speeches across the country, he displayed eloquent oratory to advocate equal treatment of China and a welcoming stance toward Chinese immigrants. On July 28, 1868, the mission concluded at Washington, D.C., a series of articles, supplementary to the Reed Treaty of 1858, and later known as the Burlingame Treaty. The treaty provided that Chinese subjects in the United States should enjoy the same rights as citizens of the most favored nation, a legal strategy which up until that point had only been used to expand foreign privileges in China. Burlingame worked successfully to include a clause permitting Chinese to become citizens, which was barred by American law. This treaty was the first equal treaty between China and a western power after the Opium War.Schrecker, \\"'For the Equality of Men -- for the Equality of Nations',\\" 29-30. Subsequently, Burlingame also negotiated treaties with Denmark, Sweden, Holland, and Prussia. He died suddenly at Saint Petersburg on February 23, 1870, while negotiating terms for a treaty with Russia. He was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Family His son Edward L. Burlingame was founding editor of Scribner's Magazine. Legacy Bust of Anson Burlingame, by Zhou Limin, at the Burlingame Public Library 2018 After Burlingame's death, the spirit and many of the specific provisions of the treaty bearing his name were reversed. Foreign powers continued to encroach upon China, and Congress passed strict laws against Chinese immigration. The success of the Communist Revolution of 1949 led to animosity between the two countries and Burlingame's reputation was as a naive and euphoric advocate of China. After warming of relations in the 1980s, Burlingame's reputation began to rise again, however.Schrecker, \\"'For the Equality of Men -- for the Equality of Nations',\\" 33-34. Burlingame, California; Burlingame, Kansas; and Anson, Wisconsin, are all named after Anson Burlingame.John Rydjord, Kansas Place Names (University of Oklahoma Press, 1981), 357.

There is no limit to the number of moves which are allowed to achieve the win; this distinguishes studies from the genre of direct mate problems (e.g. \\"mate in 2\\"). Such problems also differ qualitatively from the very common genre of tactical puzzles based around the middlegame, often based on an actual game, where a decisive tactic must be found. Composed studies Composed studies predate the modern form of chess. Shatranj studies exist in manuscripts from the 9th century, and the earliest treatises on modern chess by the likes of Luis Ramirez Lucena and Pedro Damiano (late 15th and early 16th century) also include studies. However, these studies often include superfluous pieces, added to make the position look more \\"game-like\\", but which take no part in the actual solution (something that is never done in the modern study). Various names were given to these positions (Damiano, for example, called them \\"subtleties\\"); the first book which called them \\"studies\\" appears to be Chess Studies, an 1851 publication by Josef Kling and Bernhard Horwitz, which is sometimes also regarded as the starting point for the modern endgame study. The form is considered to have been raised to an art in the late 19th century, with A. A. Troitsky and Henri Rinck particularly important in this respect. Most composers, including Troitsky, Rinck, and other famous figures such as Genrikh Kasparyan, are known primarily for their studies, being little known as players. However, some famous players have also composed endgame studies, with Emanuel Lasker, Richard R√©ti, Vasily Smyslov, and Jan Timman being perhaps the most notable ones. Examples Richard R√©ti's study is one of the most famous of all time. It is White to play and draw. At first sight, this seems an impossible task: if White tries to chase after Black's pawn he can never catch it (1.Kh7 h4 2.Kh6 h3 etc. is clearly hopeless), while it is clear that Black will simply take White's pawn if he tries to promote it. White can draw however, by taking advantage of the fact that the king can move in two directions at once: towards Black's pawn and towards White's own. The solution is 1. Kg7 h4 (1...Kb6 2. Kf6! h4 3.Ke5! transposes) 2. Kf6! Kb6 (if 2...h3, then 3.Ke6 h2 4.c7 Kb7 5.Kd7 allows white to promote his pawn) 3. Ke5! Now, if 3...Kxc6, then 4.Kf4 stops Black's pawn after all, while if 3...h3 4.Kd6 allows White to promote his pawn. Either way, the result is a draw. (Also see King and pawn versus king endgame, the section Rule of the square.) { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Genrikh Kasparyan, Magyar Sakk√©let 1962   } Not all studies are as simple as the above R√©ti example. This study (first diagram) is by Genrikh Kasparyan (first published in Magyar Sakk√©let, 1962). White is to play and draw. The main line of the solution is 1. Ra1 a2 2. Ke6 Ba3 3. Bf4 Bb2 4. Be5 a3 5. Kd5 Bg6 6. Bd4 Bf7+ 7. Ke4 Bc4 8. Rg1, but there are various alternatives for both sides. For example, White could try 1.Bf4 on his first move, with the idea 1...Bxa2 2.Bxd6 and 3.Bxa3 is a draw, but Black can defeat this idea with 1...Bxf4 2.Rxa3 Bc2, which wins. To understand why one move works and another one does not, requires quite advanced chess knowledge. Indeed, it will not be obvious to many players that the position at the end of the given line (second diagram) is a draw at all. One of the most notable studies is Leopold Mitrofanov's 1967 first-prize winner. Unfortunately, Mitrofanov's original study was subsequently found to have a , a miraculous defense that enabled Black either to obtain perpetual check or reach a drawn ending. Solution: 1. b6+ Ka8 2. Re1! Nxe1 3. g7 h1=Q (if 3...Nc4+ then 4.Kb5 h1=Q 5.g8=Q+ Bb8 6.a7 Na3+ 7.Kc6 Qh2 8.axb8=Q+ Qxb8 9.b7+ Ka7 10.Qg1+ Ka6 11.Qb6 mate) 4. g8=Q+ Bb8 5. a7 Nc6+ 6. dxc6 Qxh5+ (not 7.Ka6 Qe2+ or 7.Kb4? Qh4+ with perpetual check, 7. Qg5 Qxg5+ 8. Ka6 (the queen is deflected from the white diagonal where she could give check) 8... Bxa7 (or 8...Qb5+ 9.Kxb5 Nc2 10.c7 and wins) 9. c7! (a silent move; the double threat c8=Q+ and b7 mate forces Black to sacrifice the queen) 9... Qa5+ 10. Kxa5 Kb7 11. bxa7 and White wins. =Early example= Most old shatranj studies are not valid in modern chess because of changed rules. However, the moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. In this Arabic study White wins because the black knight is poorly placed. With White to move the best move is 1. Rd1, but it is not the only winning move. If Black is to move, 1... Kb8! 2. Kc6! Na5+! 3. Kb6! Nc4+ 4. Kb5! Ne5 5. Re1! Nd7 6. Kc6! wins. Studies and special moves The special moves or rules of chess, such as castling, underpromotion, double-square pawn advance, and en passant are commonly a key feature of studies, as are sacrifices. =Castling= Castling in the endgame occurs seldom and is more often seen in studies. Here is one example where White wins by privilege of castling rights. : 1.0-0-0? Ra2! 2.d7 Ra1+ 3.Kc2 Rxd1 4.Kxd1 Kc7 drawn. White needs: 1. d7! Kc7 2. d8=Q+! Kxd8 3. 0-0-0+ simultaneously attacking the king and rook that is captured next move. Study engineering  With the creation and popularization of chess-playing computer software programs, a number of which have achieved Elo ratings higher than top human players, many composers collaborate with them both in composing and solving compositions. Though proven to be helpful, positions have been found which cause even the strongest engines to incorrectly evaluate the outcome. Chess master Fr√©d√©ric Lazard's 1946 composition is White to play and draw. Top chess engines, such as Stockfish, evaluate the position as clearly won for Black. Solution: 1. Ne4+ Kh4 (1...dxe4 2.Be1#) 2. Ng3! Qf8 (2...fxg3 3.Bb6) 3. Be1 fxg3 4. Bf2! d4 (4...Qxf2 stalemate, 4...gxf2 5.g3+ Kh3 stalemate) 5. Bxd4 c5 6. Bxc5 Qf1+ 7. Bg1 Qf2 8. Bxf2 gxf2 9. g3+ Kxg3 drawn.

The airport is co-located with AFB Durban. History The airport was opened in 1951, replacing the Stamford Hill Aerodrome. The original name of the airport was Louis Botha International, named after the South African statesman. The airport maintained this name until 1994 when the political changes that came with that year in South Africa resulted in a change of name to Durban International Airport. While the airport served the domestic market well, the airport suffered from low international passenger numbers and a runway that was too short for a fully laden Boeing 747 to take off. Due to the short runway and the hub and spoke policy that was adopted in the 1990s (favouring OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg), Durban lost almost all of its international traffic. Plans to move the airport to La Mercy, approximately north of Durban International Airport, were proposed and shelved numerous times between the 1970s and 2007, before construction of what was to become King Shaka International Airport began in September 2007. Construction of the new airport was completed in 2010, with Durban International Airport handling its final flight on 30 April 2010 and all flights transferring to King Shaka International Airport in a single, overnight move. Accidents and incidents * On 30 June 1962, a Douglas DC-4 (registration ZS-BMH) operating a scheduled South African Airways flight from Johannesburg to Durban collided with a South African Air Force Harvard trainer. The DC-4 made a successful emergency landing with 46 passengers and 5 crew; the Harvard trainer crashed with its crew of two parachuting to safety. The DC-4 was subsequently repaired. * On 28 December 1973, a Douglas DC-3 (registration ZS-DAK) operated by Executive Funds lost both engines when turning onto final approach and ditched in the Indian Ocean. One passenger drowned out of the 22 passengers and 3 crew. *On 26 November 1981 a hijacked Air India B707-300 (registration VT-DVB) was forced to land at the airport. The plane had been hijacked by mercenaries fleeing an abortive coup in the Seychelles. After freeing the 79 passengers and crew the mercenaries surrendered. * On 18 June 2008, a British Airways Boeing 737-200 registration ZS-OKD (operated by Comair), operating as Flight 6203 from Johannesburg, skidded off the runway while landing under adverse weather conditions. The aircraft was reported to have hit a wet patch on the tarmac, causing it to skid and resulting in the right landing-gear becoming embedded in the surrounding earth. The incident caused the closure of the airport for both arrivals and departures for several hours. All 87 passengers and six crew members escaped without serious injury. * On 24 September 2009, Airlink Flight 8911 crashed in the suburb of Merebank shortly after takeoff from Durban International Airport, injuring its crew of three and one person on the ground, with the pilot subsequently dying of his injuries in hospital. Plans The airport was used by the South African Air Force and the Police Air Wing during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, before being decommissioned. Although it is currently unclear as to what the future usage of the airport site will be, it is widely expected that the site will be used for future industrial development. The site is located on a large parcel of flat land in the Durban South Industrial Basin, which is already home to much of the city's heavy industry; given Durban's generally very hilly terrain, such a large, flat parcel is ideal for future industrial development, port expansion, or both. Ownership of the airport was transferred from the Airports Company South Africa to Transnet in 2012, for the construction of a dig-out port. In 2017, it was reported that plans for the dig-out port had been placed on hold until \\"at least 2030\\". No provision was made during the planning and construction of KSIA to accommodate the South African Air Force base at DIA, thus AFB Durban, 15 Squadron and related support units are still operating from this airport.

East London's airport is a small but bustling one that plays an important role in the growing economy of the Eastern Cape. Every day it welcomes between 20 and 30 flights ‚Äì which bring people to East London each year. Of these, about are holidaymakers, mostly local, and about 15% are foreign tourists. In 2013, the airport served 658,363 passengers. In 2016, East London Airport was voted the fastest growing airport in South Africa, having accomplished an almost 19% increase in traffic over a 12-month-period. The airport welcomed over 806,000 passengers in 2016, beating the 679,000 that passed through East London in 2015. The second best performing airport for growth in 2014 was Kimberley, with its traffic growing by 11%. Overall the top airports of South Africa witnessed nearly 39.7 million passengers in 2016, up 5.3% on the year before.  History  The airport had an inauspicious beginning in 1927, when Lieut Colonel Alistair Miller asked the East London town council to help establish a municipal aerodrome at Woodbrook, west of the city. Passenger flights were undertaken by two de Havilland Moth planes on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sundays, weather permitting. Flights could also be booked for weekdays, but only by special arrangement. In 1931 it took 11 hours to fly from Windhoek in Namibia to East London. In 1944 a new airport was built at Collondale, about 2 km west of the present terminal building. In 1965 the airport was again moved, this time to its present site, 9 km west of the city centre. Construction of the terminal buildings finished in 1966, and the airport was named after Ben Schoeman, the minister of transport at the time. The airport was renamed in 1994. Since then, major alterations to the terminal building have been completed and a new first-floor office development for the airport management team has been added.

Noted for its aerodynamic, futuristic body design and innovative technology, the DS set new standards in ride quality, handling, and braking ‚Äî the latter as the first mass production car equipped with disc brakes. Italian sculptor and industrial designer Flaminio Bertoni and the French aeronautical engineer Andr√© Lef√®bvre styled and engineered the car, and Paul Mag√®s developed the hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension. Citro√´n sold 1,455,746 examples, including 1,330,755 manufactured at the manufacturer's Paris Quai Andr√©-Citro√´n production plant. The DS placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century poll recognizing the world's most influential auto designs and was named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic & Sports Car magazine. Model history After 18 years of secret development as the successor to the Traction Avant, the DS 19 was introduced on 5 October 1955 at the Paris Motor Show. In the first 15 minutes of the show, 743 orders were taken, and orders for the first day totalled 12,000. During the 10 days of the show, the DS took in 80,000 deposits; a record that stood for over 60 years, until it was eclipsed by the Tesla Model 3 which received 180,000 first day deposits in March 2016. Contemporary journalists said the DS pushed the envelope in the ride vs. handling compromise possible in a motor vehicle. To a France still deep in reconstruction after the devastation of World War II, and also building its identity in the post-colonial world, the DS was a symbol of French ingenuity.Fifty Cars That Changed the World by Design Museum, 2010, The DS was distributed to many territories throughout the world. Turn indicators were mounted in the upper corners of the rear window It also posited the nation's relevance in the Space Age, during the global race for technology of the Cold War. Structuralist philosopher Roland Barthes, in an essay about the car, said that it looked as if it had \\"fallen from the sky\\". An American advertisement summarised this selling point: \\"It takes a special person to drive a special car\\". Because they were owned by the technologically aggressive tire manufacturer Michelin, Citro√´n had designed their cars around the technically superior radial tire since 1948, and the DS was no exception. The car featured a novel hydropneumatic suspension including an automatic leveling system and variable ground clearance,\\"...gliding on air with only the flick of the speedometer needle to remind you you're in motion! No bumping, jerking, dragging, lurching.\\" From an ad for the Citro√´n stand at the Motor Show, London, 1957 developed in-house by Paul Mag√®s. This suspension allowed the DS to travel quickly on the poor road surfaces common in France. In addition, the vehicle had power steering and a semi-automatic transmission (the transmission required no clutch pedal, but gears still had to be shifted by hand), though the shift lever controlled a powered hydraulic shift mechanism in place of a mechanical linkage, and a fibreglass roof which lowered the centre of gravity and so reduced weight transfer. Inboard front brakes (as well as independent suspension) reduced unsprung weight. Different front and rear track widths reduced the unequal tyre loading, which is well known to promote understeer, typical of front-engined and front-wheel drive cars. As with all French cars, the DS design was affected by the tax horsepower system, which effectively encouraged smaller engines. Unlike the Traction Avant predecessor, there was no top-of-range model with a powerful six-cylinder engine. Citro√´n had planned an air-cooled flat-6 engine for the car, but did not have the funds to put the prototype engine into production. The DS placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, and fifth on the 2005 list of \\"100 Coolest Cars\\" by Automobile Magazine. It was also named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic & Sports Car magazine after a poll of 20 world-renowned car designers, including Giorgetto Giugiaro, Ian Callum, Roy Axe, Paul Bracq, and Leonardo Fioravanti.  Name  Both the DS and its simpler sibling, the ID, used a punning name. \\"DS\\" is pronounced in French as \\"D√©esse\\" (goddess); \\"ID\\" is pronounced as \\"Id√©e\\" (idea). Motorsport 1000 Lakes Rally The DS was successful in motorsports like rallying, where sustained speeds on poor surfaces are paramount, and won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1959. In the 1000 Lakes Rally, Pauli Toivonen drove a DS19 to victory in 1962. In 1966, the DS won the Monte Carlo Rally again, with some controversy as the competitive BMC Mini-Cooper team was disqualified due to rule infractions. Ironically, Mini was involved with DS competition again two years later, when a drunk driver in a Mini in Sydney Australia crashed into the DS that was leading the 1968 London‚ÄìSydney Marathon, from the finish line. Robert Neyret won the Rallye du Maroc in 1969 and 1970 in a DS 21. The DS was still competitive in the grueling 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally, where it won over 70 other cars, only 5 of which even completed the entire event. Technical innovation ‚Äì hydraulic systems At rest, Citro√´n DS will slowly sink to the ground as the engine-driven hydraulic system is depressurized In conventional cars, hydraulics are only used in brakes and power steering. In the DS they were also used for the suspension, clutch, and transmission. The cheaper 1957 ID19 did have manual steering and a simplified power braking system. An engine-driven pump pressurizes the closed system to http://www.citroen-ds-id.com/ At a time when few passenger vehicles had independent suspension on all wheels, the application of the hydraulic system to the car's suspension system to provide a self-levelling system was an innovative move. This suspension allowed the car to achieve sharp handling combined with very high ride quality, frequently compared to a \\"magic carpet\\". The hydropneumatic suspension used was pioneered the year before, on the rear of another car from Citro√´n, the top of range Traction Avant 15CV-H. Impact on Citro√´n brand development Two DS and Traction Avant The 1955 DS cemented the Citro√´n brand name as an automotive innovator, building on the success of the Traction Avant, which had been the world's first mass-produced unitary body front-wheel-drive car in 1934. In fact, the DS caused such a huge sensation that Citro√´n was apprehensive that future models would not be of the same bold standard. No clean sheet new models were introduced from 1955 to 1970. The DS was a large, expensive executive car and a downward brand extension was attempted, but without result. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s Citro√´n developed many new vehicles for the very large, profitable market segments between the 2CV and the DS, occupied by vehicles like the Peugeot 403, Renault 16 and Ford Cortina, but none made it into production. Either they had uneconomic build costs, or were ordinary \\"me too\\" cars, not up to the company's high standard of innovation. As Citro√´n was owned by Michelin from 1934 to 1974 as a sort of research laboratory, such broad experimentation was possible. Michelin was getting a powerful advertisement for the capabilities of the radial tire Michelin had invented, when such experimentation was successful. New models based on the small, utilitarian 2CV economy car were introduced, notably the 1961 Ami. It was also designed by Flaminio Bertoni and aimed to combine Three-box styling with the chassis of the 2CV. The Ami was very successful in France, but less so on export markets. Many found the styling controversial, and the car noisy and underpowered. The Dyane was a modernised 2CV with a hatchback that competed with the 2CV inspired Renault 4 Hatchback. All these 2 cylinder models were very small, so there remained a wide market gap to the DS range all through the 1960s. In 1970, Citro√´n finally introduced a car to target the mid-range - the Citro√´n GS, which won the \\"European car of the Year\\" for 1971 and sold 2.5 million units. It combined a small flat-4 air-cooled engine with Hydropneumatic suspension. The intended Wankel rotary-engined version with more power did not reach full production. Replacing the DS The DS remained popular and competitive throughout its production run. Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted gearstick, and separate fenders began to seem a little old-fashioned in the 1970s. Citro√´n invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the SM, which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width. The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit. The front disc brakes were the same design. Axles, wheel bearings, steering knuckles, and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.Citro√´n SM parts and repair manuals The SM had a different purpose than replacing the 15-year-old DS design, however - it was meant to launch Citro√´n into a completely new luxury grand touring market segment. Only fitted with a costly, exotic Maserati engine, the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS. The SM was not designed to be a practical 4-door saloon suitable as a large family car, the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe. Typically, manufacturers would introduce low-volume coup√©s based on parts shared with an existing saloon, not as unique models, a contemporary example being the Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class.Mercedes-Benz Buyer's Guide, Fred Larimer, 2004, Page 81 BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid-size sedan (5 series), large coupe (6 series), and large sedan (7 series) sharing common underpinnings. The SM's high price and limited utility of the 2+2 seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS. While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars, a 'modern DS' and the smaller CX, it was left to the CX alone to provide Citro√´n's large family or executive car in the model range. The last DS came off the production line on 24 April 1975 - the manufacturer had taken the elementary precaution of building up approximately eight months of inventory of the \\"break\\" (estate/station wagon) version of the DS, to cover the period till the autumn of 1975, when the estate/station wagon version of the CX would be introduced. Development The DS maintained its size and shape, with easily removable, unstressed body panels, but design changes occurred. During the 20-year production, improvements were made on an ongoing basis. =ID 19 submodel to extend brand downwards (1957‚Äì69)= The 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the Citro√´n Traction Avant.Bobbitt, p. 64. This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II, so a cheaper submodel, the Citro√´n ID, was introduced in 1957. 1967 Citro√´n ID19B The ID shared the DS's body but was less powerful and luxurious. Although it shared the engine capacity of the DS engine (at this stage 1,911 cc), the ID provided a maximum power output of only compared to the claimed for the DS19. Power outputs were further differentiated in 1961 when the DS19 acquired a Weber-32 twin bodied carburettor, and the increasing availability of higher octane fuel enabled the manufacturer to increase the compression ratio from 7.5:1 to 8.5:1. A new DS19 now came with a promised . The ID19 was also more traditional mechanically: it had no power steering and had conventional transmission and clutch instead of the DS's hydraulically controlled set-up. Initially, the basic ID19 was sold on the French market with a price saving of more than 25% against the DS, although the differential was reduced at the end of 1961 when the manufacturer withdrew the entry-level ID19 \\"Normale\\". A station wagon variant, the ID Break, was introduced in 1958. =D Sp√©cial and D Super (1970‚Äì75)= The ID was replaced by the D Sp√©cial and D Super in 1970, but these retained the lower specification position in the range. The D Super was available with the DS21 2175 cc engine and a 5-speed gearbox, and named the D Super 5. =Series 2 - Nose redesign in 1962= In September 1962, the DS was restyled with a more aerodynamically efficient nose, better ventilation, and other improvements. It retained the open two headlamp appearance, but was available with an optional set of driving lights mounted on the front fenders. All models in the range changed nose design at the same time, including the ID and station wagon models. =Series 3 - Nose redesign in 1967 with directional headlights= In late 1967, for the 1968 model year, the DS and ID was again restyled, by Robert Opron, who also styled the 1970 SM and 1974 CX. This version had a more streamlined headlamp design, giving the car a notably shark-like appearance. This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy and the inner set swivelled with the steering wheel. This allowed the driver to see \\"around\\" turns, especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night. The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable. Behind each glass cover lens, the inboard high-beam headlamp swivels by up to 80¬∞ as the driver steers, throwing the beam along the driver's intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road. The outboard low-beam headlamps are self-leveling in response to pitching caused by acceleration and braking.Autocar Road Test No. 2056; 3 December 1965 However, this feature was not allowed in the US at the time (see World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations), so a version with four exposed headlights that did not swivel was made for the US market. Although a directional headlight was previously seen on the 1948 Tucker 48 'Torpedo', Citro√´n was the first to mass-market adaptive headlights. =New \\"green\\" hydraulic fluid= The original hydropneumatic system used a vegetable oil (liquide hydraulique v√©g√©tal, LHV), but later switched to a synthetic (liquide hydraulique synth√©tique, LHS). Both had the disadvantage of being hygroscopic. Disuse allows water to enter the hydraulic components, causing deterioration and requiring expensive maintenance. The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid. With every \\"inhalation\\" of fresh moisture- (and dust-) laden air, the fluid absorbed more water. For the 1967 model year, Citro√´n introduced a new mineral oil-based fluid LHM (Liquide Hydraulique Min√©ral). This fluid was much less harsh on the system. LHM required completely different materials for the seals. Using either fluid in the incorrect system would completely destroy the hydraulic seals very quickly. To help avoid this problem, Citro√´n added a bright green dye to the LHM fluid and also painted all hydraulic elements bright green. The former LHS parts were painted black. All models, including the station wagon and ID, were upgraded at the same time. The hydraulic fluid changed to the technically superior LHM in all markets except the US and Canada, where the change did not take place until January 1969, due to local regulations. International sales and production The DS was primarily manufactured at the Quai Andr√©-Citro√´n in the Javel neighborhood of Paris, with other manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, South Africa, the former Yugoslavia (mostly Break Ambulances), and Australia. Australia constructed their own D variant in the 1960s at Heidelberg, Victoria, identified as the ID 19 \\"Parisienne.\\"ID 19 \\"Parisienne\\", made in Heidelberg, Australia Retrieved 14 August 2012 Australian market cars were fitted with options as standard equipment such as the \\"DSpecial DeLuxe\\" that were not available on domestic European models. Until 1965 UK cars were assembled at the manufacturer's Slough premises, to the west of London, using a combination of French-made knock down kits and locally sourced components, some of them machined on site. A French electrical system superseded the British one on the Slough cars in 1962, giving rise to a switch to \\"continental style\\" negative earthing. An intermediate model between the DS and the ID, called the DW, was introduced on the UK market in 1963 with a manual transmission and simpler foot-operated clutch while retaining the DS power unit, power steering and power braking; outside of the UK this model was known as the DS19M. When the 1985 cc engine replaced the original 1911 cc unit in September 1965 the manual-equipped DSes built in Slough were renamed DS19A. The Slough factory closed on 18 February 1966 and thereafter cars for the British market were imported fully assembled from the company's French plant. The British-built cars are distinguished by their leather seats, wooden (early ID19 models) or one-piece plastic (early DS19 models) dashboards, chromed number plate mount set into the front bumper, and (on pre-1962 cars) Lucas- made electrics. These were all right hand drive cars. The DS was built and sold in South Africa from 1959 to 1975. The DS was sold in Japan, but the models were built in France and left hand drive. From 2005 to 2008, a young Frenchman named Manuel Boileau traveled around the world in a 1971 DS ambulance. It was an journey across 38 countries called Lunaya World Tour. While traveling through Laos, he located the forlorn 1974 DS Prestige belonging to Sisavang Vatthana, the last King of the Kingdom of Laos, which is now preserved and restored by specialists in Bangkok. DS in North America The DS was sold in North America from 1956 to 1972. Despite its popularity in Europe, and regard for its design from the American motoring press, it did not sell well in the United States, and little better in Canada. While promoted as a luxury car, it did not have the basic features that American buyers expected to find on such a vehicle, such as an automatic transmission, air conditioning, power windows, or a powerful engine. The DS was designed specifically to address the French market, with punitive tax horsepower taxation of large engines, as well as very poor roads ‚Äì it is no great mystery that it was a fish out of water when those constraints were removed. Further harming the DS' prospects on the other side of the Atlantic was an inadequate supply of parts for the vehicle. Jay Leno described the sporadic supply of spare parts as a problem for 1970s era customers, based on his early experiences working at a Citro√´n dealer in Boston. Additionally, the DS was expensive, with a vehicle costing $4,170 in 1969, when the price was $4,500 for a Buick Electra 225 4 door sedan. The Electra was available with an automatic transmission, power windows, and came with a much larger engine (a 7,040 cc V8), and it was hardly the only competitor to the DS to have these features as options or as standard. As a result of the insufficient supply of replacement parts, an inability to compete with bigger and more luxurious cars sold for the same price, and simply having not been designed for the North American market, sales for the DS were mediocre on the North American market, ultimately reaching a total of 38,000. US regulations at the time also banned one of the car's more advanced features: its composite headlamps with aerodynamic covered lenses. Based on legislation that dated from 1940, all automobiles sold in the U.S. were required to have round, sealed-beam headlamps that produced 75,000 candlepower. The DS's quartz iodine swiveling headlamps designed for the 1968 model were not allowed by the regulations. Even the aerodynamic headlight covers, featured on other cars such as the Jaguar E-Type were illegal and had to be removed. It was not until Ford Motor Company lobbied to have composite headlamps allowed that the sealed-beam headlamp requirements were finally rescinded in 1983. However, the European lamps were legal in Canada, including the directional headlamps. The hydraulic fluid change in 1967 also fell afoul of American regulations. NHTSA follows the precautionary principle, also used by the Food and Drug Administration, where new innovations are prohibited until their developers can prove them safe to the regulators. The castor-based LHV and synthetic LHS fluids used in European-market DSes were not certified for use in North America, so cars sold there used conventional brake fluid instead. Brake fluid (as well as LHV and LHS) is hygroscopic and miscible, readily absorbing and mixing with moisture, the idea being that within a closed hydraulic circuit these properties will ensure pockets of non-soluble water will not form and cause corrosion of the system from within. The design of the DS's hydraulic system used much more fluid and allowed much more moist air into the system than a simple hydraulic braking circuit, so the fluid's hygroscopic properties were not preventing corrosion as intended. Brake fluid also did not provide the viscosity and lubricity suited for used in the suspension, clutch and gear change mechanism. Mineral-based LHM fluid was designed to remedy these issues but Citroen was obligated to demonstrate the new fluid was safe for automotive use before it could be installed in American-market cars. It took NHTSA until January 1969 to approve it, so in the US market about half the production of cars in the 1969 model year use the older red LHS fluid and half use newer green LHM fluid, neither of which is compatible with the other. Design variations =Pallas= In 1965 a luxury upgrade, the DS Pallas (after Greek goddess Pallas Athena), was introduced. This included comfort features such as better noise insulation, a more luxurious (and optional leather) upholstery, and external trim embellishments. From 1966 the Pallas model received a driver's seat with height adjustment. =Station Wagon, Familiale, and Ambulance= A station wagon version was introduced in 1958. It was known by various names in different markets (Break in France, Safari, and Estate in the UK, Wagon in the US, and Citro√´n Australia used the terms Safari and Station-Wagon). It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack. 'Familiales' had a rear seat- mounted further back in the cabin, with three folding seats between the front and rear squabs. The standard Break had two side-facing seats in the main load area at the back. The Ambulance configuration was similar to that of the Break, but with a 60/30 split in the rear folding seat to accommodate a stretcher. A 'Commerciale' version was also available for a time. The Safari saw use as a camera car, notably by the BBC. The hydropneumatic suspension produces an unusually steady platform for filming while driving.Top Gear, series 8, episode 5 =Convertible= A convertible was offered from 1958 until 1973. The D√©capotable Cabriolet d'Usine (factory convertible) were built by French carrossier Henri Chapron, for the Citro√´n dealer network. It was an expensive car and only 1,365 were sold. These DS convertibles used a special frame which was reinforced on the side members and rear suspension swingarm bearing box, similar to, but not identical to the Break (Station Wagon) frame. =Chapron variations= In addition, Chapron also produced a few coup√©s, non- works convertibles and special sedans (including the \\"Prestige\\", same wheelbase but with a central divider, and the \\"Lorraine\\" notchback). =Bossaert Coupe= Between 1959 and 1964, Hector Bossaert produced a coup√© on a DS chassis shortened by . While the front end remained unchanged, the rear end featured notchback styling. =The Reactor= In 1965, noted American auto customizer Gene Winfield created The Reactor, a Citro√´n DS chassis, with a turbocharged flat-six engine from the Corvair driving the front wheels. Since the DS already had the engine behind the front wheels, the longer engine meant only one row of seats. This was draped in a streamlined, low slung, aluminum body. The Reactor was seen in American Television programs of the era, such as Star Trek: The Original Series episode 2.25 (\\"Bread and Circuses),\\" Batman episodes 110 (\\"Funny Feline Felonies\\") and 111 (driven by Catwoman Eartha Kitt), and Bewitched, which devoted its episode 3.19 (\\"Super Car\\") to The Reactor. = Michelin PLR = The Michelin PLR is a mobile tire evaluation machine, based on the DS Break, built in 1972, later used for promotion. Technical details =Suspension= In a hydropneumatic suspension system, each wheel is connected, not to a spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher-riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, oleopneumatic (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. Hydropneumatic (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.) The DS did not have a jack for lifting the car off the ground. Instead, the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand. To change a flat tyre, one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting, insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre, then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting. The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above the ground, ready to be changed. This system, used on the SM also, was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that, after the suspension was raised to the high position, lifted the tire clear of the ground. The DS system, while impressive to use, sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly, especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel. =Source and reserve of pressure= The central part of the hydraulic system was the high-pressure pump, which maintained a pressure of between 130 and 150 bar in two accumulators. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front brakes, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail. Two different hydraulic pumps were used. The DS used a seven-cylinder axial piston pump driven off two belts and delivering 175 bar (2,540 psi) of pressure. The ID19, with its simpler hydraulic system, had a single-cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the camshaft. =Gearbox and clutch= Hydraulique or Citromatic The DS was initially offered only with the \\"hydraulique\\" four-speed semi-automatic (bvh‚Äî\\"bo√Æte de vitesses hydraulique\\") gearbox. This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, operated by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, disengaged the previous gear, then engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled automatically, responding to hydraulic sensing of engine rpm and the position of the butterfly valve in the carburetor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following a loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill. Unlike an automatic transmission, there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked. In addition, the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped, so the car could not be left in gear when parked. The only way to prevent the car from rolling (for example, if parked on a slope) is to use the parking brake.  Manual‚Äîfour- speed and five-speed  The later and simpler ID19 had the same gearbox and clutch, manually operated. This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in 1963. The mechanical aspects of the gearbox and clutch were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID 19. In September 1970, Citro√´n introduced a five-speed manual gearbox, in addition to the original four-speed unit. All manual transmissions used a steering column- mounted shifter.  Fully automatic  In September 1971 Citro√´n introduced a 3-speed fully automatic Borg-Warner 35 transmission gearbox, on the DS 21 and later DS 23 models. The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time. Many automatic DSs, fuel-injected DS 23 sedans with air conditioning, were sold in Australia. =Engines= Cutaway model shows engine set far back from front wheels (\\"MF layout\\"), and partially reveals configuration of the oleopneumatic suspension The DS was originally designed around an air-cooled flat-six based on the design of the 2-cylinder engine of the 2CV, similar to the motor in the Porsche 911. Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped. Thus, for such a modern car, the engine of the original DS 19 was also old- fashioned. It was derived from the engine of the 11CV Traction Avant (models 11B and 11C). It was an OHV four-cylinder engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of and a stroke of , giving a volumetric displacement of 1911 cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated at 3800 rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated at 4500 rpm. Like the Traction Avant, the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine, with the differential in between. Thus some consider the DS to be a mid engine front-wheel drive car. The DS and ID powerplants evolved throughout its 20-year production life. The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four- cylinder engine. The initial 1911 cc three main bearing engine (carried forward from the Traction Avant) of the DS 19 was replaced in 1965 with the 1985 cc five-bearing wet-cylinder motor, becoming the DS 19a (called DS 20 from September 1969). Spare tire, mounted under the hood The DS 21 was also introduced for model year 1965. This was a 2175 cc, five main bearing engine; power was 109 hp This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of Bosch electronic fuel injection for 1970, making the DS one of the first mass-market cars to use electronic fuel injection. Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time, owing to the employment of larger inlet valves. Lastly, 1973 saw the introduction of the 2347 cc engine of the DS 23 in both carbureted and fuel-injected forms. The DS 23 with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model, producing .Bobbitt, p. 131. IDs and their variants went through a similar evolution, generally lagging the DS by about one year. ID saloon models never received the DS 23 engine or fuel injection, although the Break/Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS 23 engine when it was introduced, supplemented the DS20 Break/Familiale. The top of the range ID model, The DSuper5 (DP) gained the DS21 engine (the only model that this engine was retained in) for the 1973 model year and it was mated to a five- speed gearbox. This should not be confused with the 1985 cc DSuper fitted with an optional \\"low ratio\\" five-speed gearbox, or with the previous DS21M (DJ) five-speed. In popular culture President Charles de Gaulle survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit-Clamart near Paris on 22 August 1962, planned by Algerian War veteran Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry. The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns, disable the vehicles, and then close in for the kill. De Gaulle praised the unusual abilities of his unarmoured Citro√´n DS with saving his life ‚Äì the car, riddled with bullets and all four tyres punctured, was still able to escape at full speed. Afterward, De Gaulle vowed never to ride in any other make of car. This event was accurately recreated in the 1973 film The Day of the Jackal. The 1961 Citro√´n DS 19 D√©capotable Usine by Henri Chapron garnered publicity for the new model, from its prominent film placement, when Cary Grant himself \\"telephoned the French automotive company, Citro√´n, to order a new car for use in the film\\" That Touch of Mink. Another D√©capotable Usine (1962 model) was used in the drug smuggling French Connection crime ring, until the car was seized April 26, 1968 after one of it's transatlantic voyages on SS France (1960). It was disassembled by the New York Police Department and contained a record setting seizure of heroin worth $22.4 Million in 1968 dollars. The total amount smuggled during the transatlantic voyages of the DS was according to arrested smuggler Jacques Bousquet. The DS was portrayed by a Lincoln Continental Mark III in The French Connection (1971 film). Legacy Citro√´n DS values have been rising ‚Äì a 1973 DS 23 Injection Electronique \\"Decapotable\\" (Chapron Convertible) sold for ‚Ç¨176,250 (US$209,738) at Christie's R√©tromobile in February 2006. and a similar car sold by Bonhams in February 2009 brought ‚Ç¨343,497 (US$440,436). On 18 September 2009 a 1966 DS21 Decapotable Usine was sold by Bonhams for a hammer price of UK¬£131,300. Bonhams sold another DS21 Decapotable (1973) on 23 January 2010 for ‚Ç¨189,000. Citro√´n was the featured exhibit at the Mullin Automotive Museum for the year 2017/8, and the DS made its first appearance on the lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in 2018. The DS's place in French society was demonstrated in Paris on 9 October 2005 with a celebration of the 50th anniversary of its launch. 1,600 DS cars drove in procession past the Arc de Triomphe. In 2009, Groupe PSA created a new brand - DS Automobiles, intended as high quality, high specification variations on existing models, with differing mechanics and bodywork. This brand ranges across four models, the DS3, DS4, DS5, and the China-only SUV DS 6. The DS3, launched in March 2010, is based on Citro√´n's new C3, but is more customisable and unique, bearing some resemblance to the original DS, with its \\"Shark Fin\\" side pillar. These have created their own niches, with the DS4 being a mix of a crossover and a coupe and the DS5 mixing a coupe and an estate. Many feature hybrid-diesel engines to maximise efficiency.

The FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) classifies San Carlos as a reliever airport for San Francisco International Airport. The airport is off U.S. Route 101. The airport is home to Civil Air Patrol West Bay Composite Squadron 192. Next to the airport is the Hiller Aviation Museum.  History  The San Carlos Flying Field was established during World War I by J. Paulding Edwards on a field north of Cordilleras Creek and east of today's Old County Road. A 300 foot long hangar was situated along the western end of Terminal Way. San Carlos' first pilot's license was issued on July 10, 1917 to Lieutenant Prince.Pilot's License Granted Flier at San Carlos, Redwood City Democrat, July 10, 1917 In 1923, the airfield was taken over by the Cooley family. Charles P. Cooley was the primary flight instructor and his father, Frank S. Cooley, operated the field. On July 12, 1940, a fire destroyed the main hangar and twelve aircraft. Operations were maintained on an airstrip bounded by today's Brittan Avenue, Washington Street, Old County Road, and Industrial Road. Sometime around 1935 the Cooley family established a different airfield near the foot of today's Twin Dolphin Drive in San Carlos. That facility had a 200 ft by 2100 ft runway and a building that housed various industrial activities. The Cooley family eventually determined that the airport needed to be moved because its proximity to the Phelps and Steinberger Sloughs limited the length of the runway. The Cooleys opened another airfield at the present location of the San Carlos airport in 1948. In 1952 ownership was transferred to Mr. Francis Michaud who renamed it San Carlos-Belmont Airport. Repair and administrative buildings were added and plans were developed to lengthen the runway to 7000 ft. In 1957 the field was renamed San Mateo County Airport, Inc. Ownership was split between Michaud, the Piombo Construction Company, and six other parties. San Mateo County purchased the property in 1964. Today the airport is completely funded with user and business fees and receives no money from the County's General Fund.San Carlos Airport AssociationSan Mateo County Public Works Facilities San Carlos Airport covers at an elevation of 5 feet (2 m). Its one runway, 12/30, is 2,600 by 75 feet (792 x 23 m) asphalt. A plan to lengthen the runway by 400 feet was quelled by neighbors in 1999. Aircraft with gross weight in excess of 12,500 lb (5,670 kg) are prohibited. San Carlos Airport is home to over 30 aviation related businesses. Facilities and FBOs at KSQL include Bay Aerial Helicopter Service, FlyBayArea, JATO Aviation, Rabbit Aviation Services, Surf Air, Zanette Aviation Insurance, West Valley Flying Club, Diamond Aviation Charter, and the San Carlos Flight Center. In 2007 the airport had 155,273 aircraft operations, average 425 per day: 98% general aviation, 2% air taxi and <1% military. 372 aircraft were then based at this airport: 86% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, <1% jet and 3% helicopter.  Origin of SQL airport code  As a backronym, some have speculated that the airport code of SQL is a humorous reference to the nearby headquarters of Oracle Corporation, a maker of database software. In databases, SQL, or Structured Query Language, is used for handling structured data. However, the airport had the code SQL years before Oracle's predecessor, Software Development Laboratories, was incorporated in June, 1977.  Experimental Aircraft Association  The Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) has a local chapter at San Carlos Airport. EAA Chapter 20 had about 50 members as of 2010. An on-field flight school typically hosts monthly meetings on the second Saturday of each month.

The two occupants suffered only minor injuries.https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/small-plane-down-at-san-carlos- airport/35716/  Proposed runway extension  In 1999, a proposal was given to extend the runway into the marshy area near Bair Island south of the airport. The proposal encountered opposition among the adjacent residents in Redwood Shores and Foster City, who complained about the potential for increased noise. Despite promises by San Mateo County officials, opponents felt a longer runway would lead to bigger and noisier planes, in particular, more corporate aircraft of the light jet category. As a result, the runway was not extended.

Johnson. Jenkins' career ended after he was arrested and charged with \\"disorderly conduct\\" with another man in a public restroom in Washington, D.C. It happened weeks before the 1964 presidential election, in an era when homosexual behavior was widely condemned. Personal life Jenkins was born in Jolly, Texas, and spent his childhood in Wichita Falls, Texas. There he attended Hardin Junior College and then spent two years at the University of Texas, though he did not earn a degree.New York Times: \\"Storm Center in Capital,\\" October 16, 1964. Retrieved November 13, 2010 In 1945, following his discharge from the Army, he converted to Roman Catholicism and married Helen Marjorie Whitehill. Jenkins and his wife had six children, four boys and two girls. They separated in the early 1970s but never divorced. She died in 1987. Government career Jenkins began working for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1939 when Johnson was serving in the U.S. House of Representatives as the member from Texas's 10th congressional district. For most of the next 25 years, Jenkins served as Johnson's top administrative assistant, following Johnson as he rose to become a Senator, Vice President under John F. Kennedy, and President. From 1941 until 1945, Jenkins served in the United States Army during World War II. In 1951, he returned to Wichita Falls to run for the House of Representatives. Jenkins lost to Frank N. Ikard in a race marked by attacks on Jenkins because of his Roman Catholic faith. Johnson's former aides credit Jenkins for his ability and temperament. In 1975, journalist Bill Moyers, a former Johnson aide and press secretary, wrote in Newsweek: \\"When they come to canonize political aides, [Jenkins] will be the first summoned, for no man ever negotiated the shark-infested waters of the Potomac with more decency or charity or came out on the other side with his integrity less shaken. If Lyndon Johnson owed everything to one human being other than Lady Bird, he owed it to Walter Jenkins.\\" Joseph Califano wrote, \\"Jenkins was the nicest White House aide I ever met in any administration. He was never overbearing. It was quite remarkable.\\" By the 1960s, Jenkins was more Johnson's friend than employee, close to Lady Bird Johnson and involved in their family finances as well. The Johnsons celebrated Lady Bird's fifty-first birthday at a party at Jenkins' home in December 1963.New York Times: \\"Johnson Gives Wife, 51, Gift that Helped Him to Win Her,\\" December 23, 1963.

The journalist was William White.Edward P. Levine, \\"Studying the American Press: The Walter Jenkins Case.\\" Journalism Quarterly 43.3 (1966): 493-496. Finally, on October 14, a Washington Star editor called the White House for Jenkins' comment on a story it was preparing. Jenkins turned to White House lawyers Abe Fortas, the President's personal lawyer, and Clark Clifford, who unofficially was filling the role of White House Counsel. They immediately lobbied the editors of Washington's three newspapers not to run the story, which only confirmed its significance.White, 368Fortas later emphasized that at the time he did not know the validity of the morals charge against Jenkins. The New York Times: \\"Fortas Asserts Police Need Time to Question Suspects,\\" August 6, 1965. Retrieved November 13, 2010 Within hours Clifford detailed the evidence to the President and press secretary George Reedy, who \\"openly weeping,\\"White 369 confirmed the story to reporters. Probably forewarned, Johnson told Fortas that Jenkins needed to resign. Anticipating the charge that Jenkins might have been blackmailed, Johnson immediately ordered an FBI investigation. He knew that J. Edgar Hoover would have to clear the administration of any security problem because the FBI itself would otherwise be at fault for failing to investigate Jenkins properly years before.Perlstein, 491 Hoover reported on October 22 that security had not been compromised.Evans and Novak, 480White, 369-70 Johnson later said: \\"I couldn't have been more shocked about Walter Jenkins if I'd heard that Lady Bird had tried to kill the Pope.\\"Dallek, 180 He also fed conspiracy theories that Jenkins had been framed. He claimed that before his arrest Jenkins had attended a cocktail party where the waiters came from the Republican National Committee, though the party was hosted by Newsweek to celebrate the opening of its new offices.White, 367. Dallek evaluates various claims that Jenkins was set up and dismisses them. Dallek, 180-1 The Star printed the story and UPI transmitted its version on October 14. Jenkins resigned the same day. Johnson immediately ordered a poll to determine the public's reaction to the affair and learned the next day that its effect on the voters was negligible.Thomas W. Benham, \\"Polling for a Presidential Candidate: Some Observations on the 1964 Campaign,\\" in Public Opinion Quartery, v. 29 (1965), 192 The President announced that only he would contact the press about the incident, but his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, issued her own statement of support for Jenkins. =Political reactions= The incident embarrassed the administration but had little impact on the campaign in which Johnson led his opponent by large margins. One columnist wrote on October 15, \\"Walter Jenkins has revived and dramatized all the harsh feelings about morals, and political cliques, and the Texas gang in Washington.\\" Yet the incident disappeared so quickly from the political scene that Theodore H. White, surveying the 1964 election campaign, assessed its impact this way: \\"Perhaps the most amazing of all events of the campaign of 1964 is that the nation faced the fact fully‚Äîand shrugged its shoulders.\\" Jenkins' arrest was quickly overshadowed by international affairs: Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was deposed on October 14, the British electorate voted Labour into power on October 15, and China successfully tested a nuclear weapon on October 16.Dallek, 181; White 371 Johnson's Republican opponent in the 1964 presidential election, Barry Goldwater, knew Jenkins from the Senate and from serving as commanding officer of his Air Force Reserve unit, but initially denied knowing him. He did not comment on the incident while campaigning, though it fit well with the charges he had been making of a lack of morality in Johnson's administration, though he was referring to Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes.Dallek, 178; White, 369 Instead, since FBI agents had just questioned him about Jenkins, he publicly asked Hoover to explain why Jenkins had not undergone a rigorous security check before joining the White House staff.New York Times: E.W. Kenworthy, \\"Goldwater Asks F.B.I. to Explain Check on Jenkins,\\" October 20, 1964.

During the remainder of the campaign Goldwater occasionally alluded to the scandal. In speeches he referred to Johnson's \\"curious crew who would run the country\\" to the knowing amusement of his audience.Perlstein, 493 At the time, observers noted the difference between the way Goldwater alluded to the scandal and the way the Republican National Committee and Goldwater's running mate, William E. Miller, used it to exploit \\"popular fears.\\"New York Times:James Reston, \\"Washington: Barry Goldwater Examples of Morality,\\" October 23, 2010.

Some things, like loyalty to friends or lasting principle, are more important.\\" Johnson mentioned the affair in general terms while campaigning. In Pittsburgh on October 27, he told a crowd that in government \\"unfortunate things\\" happen and people \\"disappoint\\" you.

The refracting telescope design was originally used in spy glasses and astronomical telescopes but is also used for long focus camera lenses. Although large refracting telescopes were very popular in the second half of the 19th century, for most research purposes, the refracting telescope has been superseded by the reflecting telescope, which allows larger apertures. A refractor's magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the objective lens by that of the eyepiece. Refracting telescopes typically have a lens at the front, then a long tube, then an eyepiece or instrumentation at the rear, where the telescope view comes to focus. Originally, telescopes had an objective of one element, but a century later, two and even three element lenses were made. Refracting telescope is a technology that has often been applied to other optical devices such as binoculars and zoom lenses/telephoto lens/long-focus lens. Invention Refractors were the earliest type of optical telescope. The first record of a refracting telescope appeared in the Netherlands about 1608, when a spectacle maker from Middelburg named Hans Lippershey unsuccessfully tried to patent one.Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupr√©, Rob van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope, Amsterdam University Press, 2010, pages 3-4, 15 News of the patent spread fast and Galileo Galilei, happening to be in Venice in the month of May 1609, heard of the invention, constructed a version of his own, and applied it to making astronomical discoveries. Refracting telescope designs right All refracting telescopes use the same principles. The combination of an objective lens 1 and some type of eyepiece 2 is used to gather more light than the human eye is able to collect on its own, focus it 5, and present the viewer with a brighter, clearer, and magnified virtual image 6. The objective in a refracting telescope refracts or bends light. This refraction causes parallel light rays to converge at a focal point; while those not parallel converge upon a focal plane. The telescope converts a bundle of parallel rays to make an angle Œ±, with the optical axis to a second parallel bundle with angle Œ≤. The ratio Œ≤/Œ± is called the angular magnification. It equals the ratio between the retinal image sizes obtained with and without the telescope.Stephen G. Lipson, Ariel Lipson, Henry Lipson, Optical Physics 4th Edition, Cambridge University Press, Refracting telescopes can come in many different configurations to correct for image orientation and types of aberration. Because the image was formed by the bending of light, or refraction, these telescopes are called refracting telescopes or refractors. =Galilean telescope= thumb400px Optical diagram of Galilean telescope y ‚Äì Distant object ; y‚Ä≤ ‚Äì Real image from objective ; y‚Ä≥ ‚Äì Magnified virtual image from eyepiece ; D ‚Äì Entrance pupil diameter ; d ‚Äì Virtual exit pupil diameter ; L1 ‚Äì Objective lens ; L2 ‚Äì Eyepiece lens e ‚Äì Virtual exit pupil ‚Äì Telescope equalshttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Galileantelescope_2.png The design Galileo Galilei used is commonly called a Galilean telescope. It used a convergent (plano-convex) objective lens and a divergent (plano- concave) eyepiece lens (Galileo, 1610).Sidereus Nuncius or The Sidereal Messenger, 1610, Galileo Galilei et al., 1989, pg. 37, The University of Chicago Press, Albert van Helden tr., (History Dept. Rice University, Houston, TX), . A Galilean telescope, because the design has no intermediary focus, results in a non-inverted and, with the help of some devices, an upright image. Galileo's most powerful telescope, with a total length of , magnified objects about 30 times. Because of flaws in its design, such as the shape of the lens and the narrow field of view, the images were blurry and distorted. Despite these flaws, the telescope was still good enough for Galileo to explore the sky. He used it to view craters on the Moon, the four largest moons of Jupiter, and the phases of Venus. Parallel rays of light from a distant object (y) would be brought to a focus in the focal plane of the objective lens (F‚Ä≤ L1 / y‚Ä≤). The (diverging) eyepiece (L2) lens intercepts these rays and renders them parallel once more. Non-parallel rays of light from the object traveling at an angle Œ±1 to the optical axis travel at a larger angle (Œ±2 > Œ±1) after they passed through the eyepiece. This leads to an increase in the apparent angular size and is responsible for the perceived magnification. The final image (y‚Ä≥) is a virtual image, located at infinity and is the same way up as the object. =Keplerian telescope= Engraved illustration of a focal length Keplerian astronomical refracting telescope built by Johannes Hevelius. The Keplerian telescope, invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, is an improvement on Galileo's design. It uses a convex lens as the eyepiece instead of Galileo's concave one. The advantage of this arrangement is that the rays of light emerging from the eyepiece are converging. This allows for a much wider field of view and greater eye relief, but the image for the viewer is inverted. Considerably higher magnifications can be reached with this design, but to overcome aberrations the simple objective lens needs to have a very high f-ratio (Johannes Hevelius built one with a focal length, and even longer tubeless \\"aerial telescopes\\" were constructed). The design also allows for use of a micrometer at the focal plane (to determine the angular size and/or distance between objects observed). Huygens built an aerial telescope for Royal Society of London with a 19 cm (7.5‚Ä≥) single-element lens.Paul Schlyter, Largest optical telescopes of the world =Achromatic refractors= Alvan Clark polishes the big Yerkes achromatic objective lens, over 1 meter across, in 1896. This 12 inch refractor is mounted in dome and a mount the rotates with the turn of the Earth The next major step in the evolution of refracting telescopes was the invention of the achromatic lens, a lens with multiple elements that helped solve problems with chromatic aberration and allowed shorter focal lengths. It was invented in 1733 by an English barrister named Chester Moore Hall, although it was independently invented and patented by John Dollond around 1758. The design overcame the need for very long focal lengths in refracting telescopes by using an objective made of two pieces of glass with different dispersion, 'crown' and 'flint glass', to reduce chromatic and spherical aberration. Each side of each piece is ground and polished, and then the two pieces are assembled together. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. Chester More Hall is noted as having made the first twin color corrected lens in 1730. Dollond achromats were quite popular in the 18th century. A major appeal was they could be made shorter. However, problems with glass making meant that the glass objectives were not made more than about four inches in diameter. In the late 19th century, the glass maker Guinand developed a way to make higher quality glass blanks of greater than four inches. He also passed this technology to his apprentice Fraunhofer, who further developed this technology and also developed the Fraunhofer doublet lens design. The breakthrough in glass making techniques led to the great refractors of the 19th century, that became progressively larger through the decade, eventually reaching over 1 meter by the end of that century before being superseded by silvered-glass reflecting telescopes in astronomy. Noted lens makers of the 19th century include: The Greenwich 28-inch refractor is a popular tourist attraction in the 21st century in London *Alvan Clark *Brashear *Chance Brothers *Cauchoix *Fraunhofer * Gautier *Grubb *Henry Brothers *Lerebours *Tulley Some famous 19th century doublet refractors are the James Lick telescope (91 cm/36 in) and the Greenwich 28 inch refractor (71 cm). An example of an older refractor is the Shuckburgh telescope (dating to the late 1700s). A famous refractor was the \\"Trophy Telescope\\", presented at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. The era of the 'great refractors' in the 19th century saw large achromatic lenses, culminating with the largest achromatic refractor ever built, the Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900. In the Royal Observatory, Greenwich an 1838 instrument named the Sheepshanks telescope includes an objective by Cauchoix. The Sheepshanks had a 6.7 inch (17 cm) wide lens, and was the biggest telescope at Greenwich for about twenty years. An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the then-new Sheepshanks telescope with the Cauchoix doublet:In the 1900s a noted optics maker was Zeiss. An example of prime achievements of refractors, over 7 million people have been able to view through the 12-inch Zeiss refractor at Griffith Observatory since its opening in 1935; this is the most people to have viewed through any telescope. Achromats were popular in astronomy for making star catalogs, and they required less maintenance than metal mirrors. Some famous discoveries using achromats are the planet Neptune and the Moons of Mars. The long achromats, despite having smaller aperture than the larger reflectors, were often favoured for \\"prestige\\" observatories. In the late 18th century, every few years, a larger and longer refractor would debut. For example, the Nice Observatory debuted with refractor, the largest at the time, but was surpassed within only a couple of years.The Observatory, \\"Large Telescopes\\", Page 248 =Apochromatic refractors= The Apochromatic lens usually comprises three elements that bring light of three different frequencies to a common focus Apochromatic refractors have objectives built with special, extra-low dispersion materials. They are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (tertiary spectrum) can be down to an order of magnitude less than that of an achromatic lens. Such telescopes contain elements of fluorite or special, extra-low dispersion (ED) glass in the objective and produce a very crisp image that is virtually free of chromatic aberration. Due to the special materials needed in the fabrication, apochromatic refractors are usually more expensive than telescopes of other types with a comparable aperture. In the 18th century, Dollond, a popular maker of doublet telescopes, also made a triplet, although they were not really as popular as the two element telescopes. One of the famous triplet objectives is the Cooke triplet, noted for being able to correct the Seidal aberrations. It is recognized as one of the most important objective designs in the field of photography. The Cooke triplet can correct, with only three elements, for one wavelength, spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, field curvature, and distortion.  Technical considerations  The refractor, at Yerkes Observatory, the largest achromatic refractor ever put into astronomical use (photo taken on 6 May 1921, as Einstein was visiting) Refractors suffer from residual chromatic and spherical aberration. This affects shorter focal ratios more than longer ones. A achromatic refractor is likely to show considerable color fringing (generally a purple halo around bright objects). A 16 has little color fringing. In very large apertures, there is also a problem of lens sagging, a result of gravity deforming glass. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens sags due to gravity, distorting the images it produces. The largest practical lens size in a refracting telescope is around . There is a further problem of glass defects, striae or small air bubbles trapped within the glass. In addition, glass is opaque to certain wavelengths, and even visible light is dimmed by reflection and absorption when it crosses the air- glass interfaces and passes through the glass itself. Most of these problems are avoided or diminished in reflecting telescopes, which can be made in far larger apertures and which have all but replaced refractors for astronomical research. The ISS-WAC on the Voyager 1/2 used a 6 cm (2.36‚Ä≥) lens, launched into space in the late 1970s, an example of the use of refractors in space. Applications & Achievements The \\"Gro√üe Refraktor\\" a double telescope with a 80cm (31.5\\") and 50 cm (19.5\\") lenses, was used to discover calcium as an interstellar medium in 1904. Astronaut trains with camera with large lens Refracting telescopes were noted for their use in astronomy as well as for terrestrial viewing. Many early discoveries of the Solar System were made with singlet refractors. The use of refracting telescopic optics are ubiquitous in photography, and are also used in Earth orbit. One of the really famous applications of refracting telescope, was when Galileo used it for astronomy; he discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter in 1609. Furthermore, early refractors were also used to discover the largest moon of Saturn, Titan, several decades later as well as three more of Saturn's moons. In the 19th century, refracting telescopes were used for pioneering work on astrophotography and spectroscopy, and the related instrument, the heliometer, was used to calculate the distance to another star for the first time. There modest apertures did not lead to as many discoveries and typically so small in aperture many astronomical objects were simply not observeable until the advent of long-exposure photograph, by which time the reputation and quirks of reflecting telescopes was beginning to exceed those of the refractors. Despite this some discoveries include the Moons of Mars, a fifth Moon of Jupiter, and many double star discoveries including Sirius (the Dog star). Refactors were often used for positional astronomy, besides from the other uses in photography and terrestrial viewing. Singlets The Galilean moons and many other moons of the solar system, were discovered with single-element objectives and aerial telescopes. Galileo Galilei's discovered the Galilean satellites of Jupiter in 1610 with a refracting telescope.Bakich M. E. (2000). The Cambridge Planetary Handbook. Cambridge University Press. pp. 220‚Äì221. . The planet Saturn's moon, Titan, was discovered on March 25, 1655, by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Doublets In 1861, the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius, was found to have smaller stellar companion using the 18 and half-inch Dearborn refracting telescope. By the 18th century refractors began to have major competition from reflectors, which could be made quite large and did not normally suffer from the same inherent problem with chromatic aberration. Nevertheless, the astronomical community continued to use doublet refractors of modest aperture in comparison to modern instruments. Noted discoveries include the Moons of Mars and a fifth moon of Jupiter, Amalthea. Asaph Hall discovered Deimos on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC and Phobos on 18 August 1877, at the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 GMT (contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon, give the time of discovery as 11 August 14:40 and 17 August 16:06 Washington mean time respectively).Morley, T. A.; A Catalogue of Ground-Based Astrometric Observations of the Martian Satellites, 1877-1982, Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series, Vol. 77, No. 2 (February 1989), pp. 209‚Äì226 (Table II, p. 220: first observation of Phobos on 1877-08-18.38498) The telescope used for the discovery was the 26-inch (66 cm) refractor (telescope with a lens) then located at Foggy Bottom. In 1893 the lens was remounted and put in a new dome, where it remains into the 21st century. Jupiter's moon Amalthea was discovered on 9 September 1892, by Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor telescope at Lick Observatory. It was discovered by direct visual observation with the doublet- lens refractor. In 1904, one of the discoveries made using Great Refractor of Potsdam (a double telescope with two doublets) was of the interstellar medium. The astronomer Professor Hartmann determined from observations of the binary star Mintaka in Orion, that there was the element calcium in the intervening space. ;Triplets Planet Pluto was discovered by looking at photographs (i.e. 'plates' in astronomy vernacular) in a blink comparator taken with a refracting telescope, an astrograph with a 3 element 13-inch lens.

Despite the common name, it is not in fact a lily. Gardening enthusiasts and horticulturists have long bred daylily species for their attractive flowers. Thousands of cultivars have been registered by local and international Hemerocallis societies. The name Hemerocallis comes from the Greek words (hƒìmera) \\"day\\" and (kalos) \\"beautiful\\".  Description  Block Island, Rhode Island. The orange daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) in China Daylilies are perennial plants, whose name alludes to its flowers, which typically last about a day. The flowers of most species open in early morning and wither during the following night, possibly replaced by another one on the same scape the next day. Some species are night-blooming. Daylilies are not commonly used as cut flowers for formal flower arranging, yet they make good cut flowers otherwise, as new flowers continue to open on cut stems over several days. Hemerocallis is native to Asia, primarily eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. This genus is popular worldwide because of the showy flowers and hardiness of many kinds. There are over 80,000 registered cultivars. Hundreds of cultivars have fragrant flowers, and more scented cultivars are appearing more frequently in northern hybridization programs. Some earlier blooming cultivars rebloom later in the season, particularly if their capsules, in which seeds are developing, are removed. Despite the name, daylilies are not true lilies, although the flower has a similar shape. Before 2009, the scientific classification of daylilies put them into the family Liliaceae. Unlike daylillies, which have a fibrous root system, Liliaceae species grow from bulbs and, if ingested, are harmful to humans and animals. It is a common misconception that daylilies share the toxic properties of true lilies. In 2009, under the APG III system, daylilies were removed from the family Liliaceae and assigned to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, subfamily Hemerocallidoideae. Xanthorrhoeaceae was renamed Asphodelaceae in AGP IV. Most kinds of daylilies occur as clumps, each of which has leaves, a crown, scapes, flowers, and roots. The long, linear lanceolate leaves are grouped into opposite fans with arching leaves. The crown is the small white portion between the leaves and the roots. Along the scape of some kinds of daylilies, small leafy proliferations form at nodes or in bracts. A proliferation forms roots when planted and is an exact clone of its parent plant. Many kinds of daylilies have thickened roots in which they store food and water. A normal, single daylily flower has three petals and three sepals, collectively called tepals, each with a midrib in either the same basic color or a different color. The centermost part of the flower, called the throat, may be a different color than the more distal areas of the tepals. Each flower usually has six stamens, each with a two-lobed anther. After successful pollination, a flower forms a botanical capsule (often erroneously called a pod since botanical pods are found in Fabaceae, not Hemerocallis). The orange or tawny daylily (Hemerocallis fulva), common along roadsides in much of North America, is native to Asia. Along with the lemon lily (Hemerocallis flava), it is the foundational species for most modern cultivars. Although the buds and flowers are often used by humans in gourmet dishes, Hemerocallis species are toxic to cats and ingestion may be fatal. Treatment is usually successful if started before kidney failure has developed.

There are thousand-year-old Chinese paintings showing orange daylilies that are remarkably similar to the flowers that grace modern gardens. Daylilies may have been first brought to Europe by traders along the silk routes from Asia. However it was not until 1753 that daylilies were given their botanic name of Hemerocallis by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Daylilies were first brought to North America by early European immigrants, who packed the roots along with other treasured possessions for the journey to the New World. By the early 1800s, the plant had become naturalized, and a bright orange clump of flowers was a common sight in many homestead gardens. As popular as daylilies were for many hundreds of years, it was not until the late 19th century that botanists and gardeners began to experiment with hybridizing the plants. Over the next hundred years, thousands of different hybrids were developed from only a few wild varieties. In fact, most modern hybrids are descended from two types of daylily. One is Hemerocallis flava‚Äîthe yellow lemon lily. The other is Hemerocallis fulva, the familiar tawny-orange daylily, also known affectionately as the \\"ditch lily.\\" Cultivation The daylily has been nicknamed \\"the perfect perennial\\" by gardeners, due to its brilliant colors, ability to tolerate drought and frost and to thrive in many different climate zones, and for being generally low maintenance. It is a vigorous perennial that lasts for many years in a garden, with very little care and adapts to many different soil and light conditions. Daylilies have a relatively short blooming period, depending on the type. Some will bloom in early spring while others wait until the summer or even autumn. Most daylily plants bloom for 1 through 5 weeks, although some bloom twice in one season (\\"rebloomers)\\". =Cultivars= There are more than 80,000 daylily cultivars. Depending on the species and cultivar, daylilies grow in USDA plant hardiness zones 1 through 11, making them some of the more adaptable landscape plants. Hybridizers have developed the vast majority of cultivars within the last 100 years. The large-flowered, bright yellow Hemerocallis 'Hyperion', introduced in the 1920s, heralded a return to gardens of the once-dismissed daylily, and is still widely available in the nursery trade. Daylily breeding has been a specialty in the United States, where daylily heat- and drought-resistance made them garden standbys since the 1950s. New cultivars have sold for thousands of dollars, but many sturdy and prolific cultivars sell at reasonable prices of US$20 or less. Hemerocallis is one of the very highly hybridized plant genera. Hybridizers register hundreds of new cultivars yearly. Hybridizers have extended the genus' color range from the yellow, orange, and pale pink of the species, through vibrant reds, purples, lavenders, greenish tones, near-black, near-white, and more. However, hybridizers have not yet been able to produce a daylily with primarily blue flowers. Flowers of some cultivars have small areas of cobalt blue. Other flower traits that hybridizers developed include height, scent, ruffled edges, contrasting \\"eyes\\" in the center of a bloom, and an illusion of glitter called \\"diamond dust.\\" Sought-after improvements include foliage color, variegation, plant disease resistance, and the ability to form large, neat clumps. Hybridizers also seek to make cultivars cold-hardier by crossing evergreen and semi-evergreen plants with dormant varieties. In recent decades, many hybridizers have focused on breeding tetraploid plants, which tend to have sturdier scapes and tepals than diploids, as well as some flower-color traits that are not found in diploids. Until this trend took root, nearly all daylilies were diploid. \\"Tets,\\" as they are called by aficionados, have 44 chromosomes, while triploids have 33 chromosomes and diploids have 22 chromosomes per individual plant. Diploid and tetraploid daylilies cannot be crossed to produce new cultivarsDaylilies undated info page at University of Nebraska. Accessed August 1, 2007. Hemerocallis fulva 'Europa', H. fulva 'Kwanso', H. fulva 'Kwanso Variegata', H. fulva 'Kwanso Kaempfer', H. fulva var. maculata, H. fulva var. angustifolia, and H. fulva 'Flore Pleno' are all triploids that almost never produce seeds and reproduce almost solely by underground runners (stolons) and dividing groups by gardeners. A polymerous daylily flower is one with more than three sepals and more than three petals. Although some people synonymize \\"polymerous\\" with \\"double,\\" some polymerous flowers have over five times the normal number of petals. Formerly daylilies were only available in yellow, pink, fulvous (bronzed), and rosy-fulvous colors, now they come in an assortment of many more color shades and tints thanks to intensive hybridization. They can now be found in nearly every color except pure blue and pure white. Those with yellow, pink, and other pastel flowers may require full sun to bring out all of their colors; darker varieties, including many of those with red and purple flowers are not colorfast in bright sun.

There are three primary types of optical telescope: * refractors, which use lenses (dioptrics) * reflectors, which use mirrors (catoptrics) * catadioptric telescopes, which combine lenses and mirrors A telescope's ability to resolve small detail is directly related to the diameter (or aperture) of its objective (the primary lens or mirror that collects and focuses the light), and its light gathering power is related to the area of the objective. The larger the objective, the more light the telescope collects and the finer detail it resolves. People use telescopes and binoculars for activities such as observational astronomy, ornithology, pilotage and reconnaissance, and watching sports or performance arts. History The telescope is more a discovery of optical craftsmen than an invention of a scientist.galileo.rice.edu The Galileo Project > Science > The Telescope by Al Van Helden ‚Äì ‚Äúthe telescope was not the invention of scientists; rather, it was the product of craftsmen.‚Äù The lens and the properties of refracting and reflecting light had been known since antiquity, and theory on how they worked was developed by ancient Greek philosophers, preserved and expanded on in the medieval Islamic world, and had reached a significantly advanced state by the time of the telescope's invention in early modern Europe.progression is followed through Robert Grosseteste Witelo, Roger Bacon, through Johannes Kepler, D.

It is in the Netherlands in 1608 where the first documents describing a refracting optical telescope surfaced in the form of a patent filed by spectacle maker Hans Lippershey, followed a few weeks later by claims by Jacob Metius, and a third unknown applicant, that they also knew of this \\"art\\".Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupr√©, Rob van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope, Amsterdam University Press, 2010, pages 3-4, 15 Word of the invention spread fast and Galileo Galilei, on hearing of the device, was making his own improved designs within a year and was the first to publish astronomical results using a telescope.Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupr√©, Rob van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope, Amsterdam University Press, 2010, page 183 Galileo's telescope used a convex objective lens and a concave eye lens, a design is now called a Galilean telescope. Johannes Kepler proposed an improvement on the designSee his books Astronomiae Pars Optica and Dioptrice that used a convex eyepiece, often called the Keplerian Telescope. The next big step in the development of refractors was the advent of the Achromatic lens in the early 18th century,Sphaera - Peter Dollond answers Jesse Ramsden - A review of the events of the invention of the achromatic doublet with emphasis on the roles of Hall, Bass, John Dollond and others. which corrected the chromatic aberration in Keplerian telescopes up to that time‚Äîallowing for much shorter instruments with much larger objectives. For reflecting telescopes, which use a curved mirror in place of the objective lens, theory preceded practice. The theoretical basis for curved mirrors behaving similar to lenses was probably established by Alhazen, whose theories had been widely disseminated in Latin translations of his work. Soon after the invention of the refracting telescope Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties as lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. The potential advantages of using parabolic mirrors (primarily a reduction of spherical aberration with elimination of chromatic aberration) led to several proposed designs for reflecting telescopes,works by Bonaventura Cavalieri and Marin Mersenne among others have designs for reflecting telescopes the most notable of which was published in 1663 by James Gregory and came to be called the Gregorian telescope, but no working models were built. Isaac Newton has been generally credited with constructing the first practical reflecting telescopes, the Newtonian telescope, in 1668 although due to their difficulty of construction and the poor performance of the speculum metal mirrors used it took over 100 years for reflectors to become popular. Many of the advances in reflecting telescopes included the perfection of parabolic mirror fabrication in the 18th century,Parabolic mirrors were used much earlier, but James Short perfected their construction. See silver coated glass mirrors in the 19th century, long-lasting aluminum coatings in the 20th century,Silvering was introduced by L√©on Foucault in 1857, see madehow.com - Inventor Biographies - Jean-Bernard-L√©on Foucault Biography (1819‚Äì1868), and the adoption of long lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932. Bakich sample pages Chapter 2, Page 3 \\"John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, was one of the first to coat a mirror with aluminum. He did it by thermal vacuum evaporation.

A mid-20th century innovation was catadioptric telescopes such as the Schmidt camera, which uses both a lens (corrector plate) and mirror as primary optical elements, mainly used for wide field imaging without spherical aberration. The late 20th century has seen the development of adaptive optics and space telescopes to overcome the problems of astronomical seeing. Principles The basic scheme is that the primary light-gathering element, the objective (1) (the convex lens or concave mirror used to gather the incoming light), focuses that light from the distant object (4) to a focal plane where it forms a real image (5). This image may be recorded or viewed through an eyepiece (2), which acts like a magnifying glass. The eye (3) then sees an inverted magnified virtual image (6) of the object. Keplerian refracting telescope. The arrow at (4) is a (notional) representation of the original image; the arrow at (5) is the inverted image at the focal plane; the arrow at (6) is the virtual image that forms in the viewer's visual sphere. The red rays produce the midpoint of the arrow; two other sets of rays (each black) produce its head and tail. =Inverted images= Most telescope designs produce an inverted image at the focal plane; these are referred to as inverting telescopes. In fact, the image is both turned upside down and reversed left to right, so that altogether it is rotated by 180 degrees from the object orientation. In astronomical telescopes the rotated view is normally not corrected, since it does not affect how the telescope is used. However, a mirror diagonal is often used to place the eyepiece in a more convenient viewing location, and in that case the image is erect, but still reversed left to right. In terrestrial telescopes such as spotting scopes, monoculars and binoculars, prisms (e.g., Porro prisms) or a relay lens between objective and eyepiece are used to correct the image orientation. There are telescope designs that do not present an inverted image such as the Galilean refractor and the Gregorian reflector. These are referred to as erecting telescopes. =Design variants= Many types of telescope fold or divert the optical path with secondary or tertiary mirrors. These may be integral part of the optical design (Newtonian telescope, Cassegrain reflector or similar types), or may simply be used to place the eyepiece or detector at a more convenient position. Telescope designs may also use specially designed additional lenses or mirrors to improve image quality over a larger field of view. Characteristics Eight-inch refracting telescope at Chabot Space and Science Center Design specifications relate to the characteristics of the telescope and how it performs optically. Several properties of the specifications may change with the equipment or accessories used with the telescope; such as Barlow lenses, star diagonals and eyepieces. These interchangeable accessories don't alter the specifications of the telescope, however they alter the way the telescopes properties function, typically magnification, apparent field of view (FOV) and actual field of view. =Surface resolvability= The smallest resolvable surface area of an object, as seen through an optical telescope, is the limited physical area that can be resolved. It is analogous to angular resolution, but differs in definition: instead of separation ability between point-light sources it refers to the physical area that can be resolved. A familiar way to express the characteristic is the resolvable ability of features such as Moon craters or Sun spots. Expression using the formula is given by the sum of twice the resolving power R over aperture diameter D multiplied by the objects diameter D_{ob} multiplied by the constant \\\\Phi all divided by the objects apparent diameter D_{a}. Resolving power R is derived from the wavelength {\\\\lambda} using the same unit as aperture; where 550 nm to mm is given by: R = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{10^6} = \\\\frac{550}{10^6} = 0.00055. The constant \\\\Phi is derived from radians to the same unit as the objects apparent diameter; where the Moon's apparent diameter of D_{a} = \\\\frac{313\\\\Pi}{10800} radians to arcsecs is given by: D_{a} = \\\\frac{313\\\\Pi}{10800} \\\\cdot 206265 = 1878. An example using a telescope with an aperture of 130 mm observing the Moon in a 550 nm wavelength, is given by: F = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{2R}{D} \\\\cdot D_{ob} \\\\cdot \\\\Phi}{D_{a}} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot 0.00055}{130} \\\\cdot 3474.2 \\\\cdot 206265}{1878} \\\\approx 3.22 The unit used in the object diameter results in the smallest resolvable features at that unit. In the above example they are approximated in kilometers resulting in the smallest resolvable Moon craters being 3.22 km in diameter. The Hubble Space Telescope has a primary mirror aperture of 2400 mm that provides a surface resolvability of Moon craters being 174.9 meters in diameter, or sunspots of 7365.2 km in diameter. =Angular resolution= Ignoring blurring of the image by turbulence in the atmosphere (atmospheric seeing) and optical imperfections of the telescope, the angular resolution of an optical telescope is determined by the diameter of the primary mirror or lens gathering the light (also termed its \\"aperture\\"). The Rayleigh criterion for the resolution limit \\\\alpha_R (in radians) is given by :\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_R) = 1.22 \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{D} where \\\\lambda is the wavelength and D is the aperture. For visible light (\\\\lambda = 550 nm) in the small-angle approximation, this equation can be rewritten: :\\\\alpha_R = \\\\frac{138}{D} Here, \\\\alpha_R denotes the resolution limit in arcseconds and D is in millimeters. In the ideal case, the two components of a double star system can be discerned even if separated by slightly less than \\\\alpha_R. This is taken into account by the Dawes limit :\\\\alpha_D = \\\\frac{116}{D} The equation shows that, all else being equal, the larger the aperture, the better the angular resolution. The resolution is not given by the maximum magnification (or \\"power\\") of a telescope. Telescopes marketed by giving high values of the maximum power often deliver poor images. For large ground-based telescopes, the resolution is limited by atmospheric seeing. This limit can be overcome by placing the telescopes above the atmosphere, e.g., on the summits of high mountains, on balloon and high-flying airplanes, or in space. Resolution limits can also be overcome by adaptive optics, speckle imaging or lucky imaging for ground-based telescopes. Recently, it has become practical to perform aperture synthesis with arrays of optical telescopes. Very high resolution images can be obtained with groups of widely spaced smaller telescopes, linked together by carefully controlled optical paths, but these interferometers can only be used for imaging bright objects such as stars or measuring the bright cores of active galaxies. =Focal length and focal ratio= The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light. For an optical system in air, it is the distance over which initially collimated rays are brought to a focus. A system with a shorter focal length has greater optical power than one with a long focal length; that is, it bends the rays more strongly, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance. In astronomy, the f-number is commonly referred to as the focal ratio notated as N. The focal ratio of a telescope is defined as the focal length f of an objective divided by its diameter D or by the diameter of an aperture stop in the system. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD. An example of a telescope with a focal length of 1200 mm and aperture diameter of 254 mm is given by: N = \\\\frac {f}{D} = \\\\frac {1200}{254} \\\\approx 4.7 Numerically large Focal ratios are said to be long or slow. Small numbers are short or fast. There are no sharp lines for determining when to use these terms, and an individual may consider their own standards of determination. Among contemporary astronomical telescopes, any telescope with a focal ratio slower (bigger number) than f/12 is generally considered slow, and any telescope with a focal ratio faster (smaller number) than f/6, is considered fast. Faster systems often have more optical aberrations away from the center of the field of view and are generally more demanding of eyepiece designs than slower ones. A fast system is often desired for practical purposes in astrophotography with the purpose of gathering more photons in a given time period than a slower system, allowing time lapsed photography to process the result faster. Wide- field telescopes (such as astrographs), are used to track satellites and asteroids, for cosmic-ray research, and for astronomical surveys of the sky. It is more difficult to reduce optical aberrations in telescopes with low f-ratio than in telescopes with larger f-ratio. =Light-gathering power= Keck II telescope gathers light by using 36 segmented hexagonal mirrors to create a 10 m (33 ft) aperture primary mirror The light-gathering power of an optical telescope, also referred to as light grasp or aperture gain, is the ability of a telescope to collect a lot more light than the human eye. Its light-gathering power is probably its most important feature. The telescope acts as a light bucket, collecting all of the photons that come down on it from a far away object, where a larger bucket catches more photons resulting in more received light in a given time period, effectively brightening the image. This is why the pupils of your eyes enlarge at night so that more light reaches the retinas. The gathering power P compared against a human eye is the squared result of the division of the aperture D over the observer's pupil diameter D_{p}, with an average adult having a pupil diameter of 7mm. Younger persons host larger diameters, typically said to be 9mm, as the diameter of the pupil decreases with age. An example gathering power of an aperture with 254 mm compared to an adult pupil diameter being 7 mm is given by: P = \\\\left(\\\\frac {D}{D_{p}}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac {254}{7}\\\\right)^2 \\\\approx 1316.7 Light-gathering power can be compared between telescopes by comparing the areas A of the two different apertures. As an example, the light-gathering power of a 10-meter telescope is 25x that of a 2-meter telescope: p = \\\\frac {A_{1}}{A_{2}} = \\\\frac {\\\\pi5^2}{\\\\pi1^2} = 25 For a survey of a given area, the field of view is just as important as raw light gathering power. Survey telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope try to maximize the product of mirror area and field of view (or etendue) rather than raw light gathering ability alone. =Magnification= The magnification through a telescope makes an object appear larger while limiting the FOV. Magnification is often misleading as the optical power of the telescope, its characteristic is the most misunderstood term used to describe the observable world. At higher magnifications the image quality significantly reduces, usage of a Barlow lens increases the effective focal length of an optical system‚Äîmultiplies image quality reduction. Similar minor effects may be present when using star diagonals, as light travels through a multitude of lenses that increase or decrease effective focal length. The quality of the image generally depends on the quality of the optics (lenses) and viewing conditions‚Äînot on magnification. Magnification itself is limited by optical characteristics. With any telescope or microscope, beyond a practical maximum magnification, the image looks bigger but shows no more detail. It occurs when the finest detail the instrument can resolve is magnified to match the finest detail the eye can see. Magnification beyond this maximum is sometimes called empty magnification. To get the most detail out of a telescope, it is critical to choose the right magnification for the object being observed. Some objects appear best at low power, some at high power, and many at a moderate magnification. There are two values for magnification, a minimum and maximum. A wider field of view eyepiece may be used to keep the same eyepiece focal length whilst providing the same magnification through the telescope. For a good quality telescope operating in good atmospheric conditions, the maximum usable magnification is limited by diffraction. Visual The visual magnification M of the field of view through a telescope can be determined by the telescopes focal length f divided by the eyepiece focal length f_{e} (or diameter). The maximum is limited by the focal length of the eyepiece. An example of visual magnification using a telescope with a 1200 mm focal length and 3 mm eyepiece is given by: M = \\\\frac {f}{f_{e}} = \\\\frac {1200}{3} = 400 Minimum There is a lowest usable magnification on a telescope. The increase in brightness with reduced magnification has a limit related to something called the exit pupil. The exit pupil is the cylinder of light coming out of the eyepiece, hence the lower the magnification, the larger the exit pupil. The minimum M_{m} can be calculated by dividing the telescope aperture D over the exit pupil diameter D_{ep}. Decreasing the magnification past this limit cannot increase brightness, at this limit there is no benefit for decreased magnification. Likewise calculating the exit pupil D_{ep} is a division of the aperture diameter D and the visual magnification M used. The minimum often may not be reachable with some telescopes, a telescope with a very long focal length may require a longer-focal-length eyepiece than is possible. An example of the lowest usable magnification using a 254 mm aperture and 7 mm exit pupil is given by: M_{m} = \\\\frac {D}{D_{ep}} = \\\\frac {254}{7} \\\\approx 36, whilst the exit pupil diameter using a 254 mm aperture and 36x magnification is given by: D_{ep} = \\\\frac {D}{M} = \\\\frac {254}{36} \\\\approx 7 Optimum A useful reference is: *For small objects with low surface brightness (such as galaxies), use a moderate magnification. *For small objects with high surface brightness (such as planetary nebulae), use a high magnification. *For large objects regardless of surface brightness (such as diffuse nebulae), use low magnification, often in the range of minimum magnification. Only personal experience determines the best optimum magnifications for objects, relying on observational skills and seeing conditions. =Field of view= Field of view is the extent of the observable world seen at any given moment, through an instrument (e.g., telescope or binoculars), or by naked eye. There are various expressions of field of view, being a specification of an eyepiece or a characteristic determined from an eyepiece and telescope combination. A physical limit derives from the combination where the FOV cannot be viewed larger than a defined maximum, due to diffraction of the optics. Apparent Apparent FOV is the observable world observed through an ocular eyepiece without insertion into a telescope. It is limited by the barrel size used in a telescope, generally with modern telescopes that being either 1.25 or 2 inches in diameter. A wider FOV may be used to achieve a more vast observable world given the same magnification compared with a smaller FOV without compromise to magnification. Note that increasing the FOV lowers surface brightness of an observed object, as the gathered light is spread over more area, in relative terms increasing the observing area proportionally lowers surface brightness dimming the observed object. Wide FOV eyepieces work best at low magnifications with large apertures, where the relative size of an object is viewed at higher comparative standards with minimal magnification giving an overall brighter image to begin with. True True FOV is the observable world observed though an ocular eyepiece inserted into a telescope. Knowing the true FOV of eyepieces is very useful since it can be used to compare what is seen through the eyepiece to printed or computerized star charts that help identify what is observed. True FOV v_{t} is the division of apparent FOV v_{a} over magnification M. An example of true FOV using an eyepiece with 52¬∞ apparent FOV used at 81.25x magnification is given by: v_{t} = \\\\frac {v_{a}}{M} = \\\\frac {52}{81.25} = 0.64^\\\\circ Maximum Max FOV is the maximum useful true field of view limited by the optics of the telescope. It is a physical limitation where increases beyond the maximum remain at maximum. Max FOV v_{m} is the barrel size B over the telescope's focal length f converted from radian to degrees. An example of max FOV using a telescope with a barrel size of 31.75 mm (1.25 inches) and focal length of 1200 mm is given by: v_{m} = B \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\frac {180}{\\\\pi}}{f} \\\\approx 31.75 \\\\cdot \\\\frac {57.2958}{1200} \\\\approx 1.52^\\\\circ Observing through a telescope There are many properties of optical telescopes and the complexity of observation using one can be a daunting task; experience and experimentation are the major contributors to understanding how to maximize one's observations. In practice, only two main properties of a telescope determine how observation differs: the focal length and aperture. These relate as to how the optical system views an object or range and how much light is gathered through an ocular eyepiece. Eyepieces further determine how the field of view and magnification of the observable world change. =Observable world= The observable world is what can be seen using a telescope. When viewing an object or range, the observer may use many different techniques. Understanding what can be viewed and how to view it depends on the field of view. Viewing an object at a size that fits entirely in the field of view is measured using the two telescope properties‚Äîfocal length and aperture, with the inclusion of an ocular eyepiece with suitable focal length (or diameter). Comparing the observable world and the angular diameter of an object shows how much of the object we see. However, the relationship with the optical system may not result in high surface brightness. Celestial objects are often dim because of their vast distance, and detail may be limited by diffraction or unsuitable optical properties. =Field of view and magnification relationship= Finding what can be seen through the optical system begins with the eyepiece providing the field of view and magnification; the magnification is given by the division of the telescope and eyepiece focal lengths. Using an example of an amateur telescope such as a Newtonian telescope with an aperture D of 130 mm (5\\") and focal length f of 650 mm (25.5 inches), one uses an eyepiece with a focal length d of 8 mm and apparent FOV v_{a} of 52¬∞. The magnification at which the observable world is viewed is given by: M = \\\\frac {f}{d} = \\\\frac {650}{8} = 81.25. The field of view v_{t} requires the magnification, which is formulated by its division over the apparent field of view: v_{t} = \\\\frac {v_{a}}{M} = \\\\frac {52}{81.25} = 0.64. The resulting true field of view is 0.64¬∞, allowing an object such as the Orion nebula, which appears elliptical with an angular diameter of 65 √ó 60 arcminutes, to be viewable through the telescope in its entirety, where the whole of the nebula is within the observable world. Using methods such as this can greatly increase one's viewing potential ensuring the observable world can contain the entire object, or whether to increase or decrease magnification viewing the object in a different aspect. =Brightness factor= The surface brightness at such a magnification significantly reduces, resulting in a far dimmer appearance. A dimmer appearance results in less visual detail of the object. Details such as matter, rings, spiral arms, and gases may be completely hidden from the observer, giving a far less complete view of the object or range. Physics dictates that at the theoretical minimum magnification of the telescope, the surface brightness is at 100%. Practically, however, various factors prevent 100% brightness; these include telescope limitations (focal length, eyepiece focal length, etc.) and the age of the observer. Age plays a role in brightness, as a contributing factor is the observer's pupil. With age the pupil naturally shrinks in diameter; generally accepted a young adult may have a 7 mm diameter pupil, an older adult as little as 5 mm, and a younger person larger at 9 mm. The minimum magnification m can be expressed as the division of the aperture D and pupil p diameter given by: m = \\\\frac {D}{d} = \\\\frac {130}{7} \\\\approx 18.6. A problematic instance may be apparent, achieving a theoretical surface brightness of 100%, as the required effective focal length of the optical system may require an eyepiece with too large a diameter. Some telescopes cannot achieve the theoretical surface brightness of 100%, while some telescopes can achieve it using a very small-diameter eyepiece. To find what eyepiece is required to get minimum magnification one can rearrange the magnification formula, where it is now the division of the telescope's focal length over the minimum magnification: \\\\frac {F}{m} = \\\\frac {650}{18.6} \\\\approx 35. An eyepiece of 35 mm is a non-standard size and would not be purchasable; in this scenario to achieve 100% one would require a standard manufactured eyepiece size of 40 mm. As the eyepiece has a larger focal length than the minimum magnification, an abundance of wasted light is not received through the eyes. =Exit pupil= The limit to the increase in surface brightness as one reduces magnification is the exit pupil: a cylinder of light that projects out the eyepiece to the observer. An exit pupil must match or be smaller in diameter than one's pupil to receive the full amount of projected light; a larger exit pupil results in the wasted light. The exit pupil e can be derived with from division of the telescope aperture D and the minimum magnification m, derived by: e = \\\\frac {D}{m} = \\\\frac {130}{18.6} \\\\approx 7. The pupil and exit pupil are almost identical in diameter, giving no wasted observable light with the optical system. A 7 mm pupil falls slightly short of 100% brightness, where the surface brightness B can be measured from the product of the constant 2, by the square of the pupil p resulting in: B = 2*p^2 = 2*7^2 = 98. The limitation here is the pupil diameter; it's an unfortunate result and degrades with age. Some observable light loss is expected and decreasing the magnification cannot increase surface brightness once the system has reached its minimum usable magnification, hence why the term is referred to as usable. These eyes represent a scaled figure of the human eye where 15 px = 1 mm, they have a pupil diameter of 7 mm. Figure A has an exit pupil diameter of 14 mm, which for astronomy purposes results in a 75% loss of light. Figure B has an exit pupil of 6.4 mm, which allows the full 100% of observable light to be perceived by the observer. =Image Scale= When using a CCD to record observations, the CCD is placed in the focal plane. Image scale (sometimes called plate scale) is how the angular size of the object being observed is related to the physical size of the projected image in the focal plane i = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{s}, where i is the image scale, \\\\alpha is the angular size of the observed object, and s is the physical size of the projected image. In terms of focal length image scale is i = \\\\frac{1}{f}, where i is measured in radians per meter (rad/m), and f is measured in meters. Normally i is given in units of arcseconds per millimeter (\\"/mm). So if the focal length is measured in millimeters, the image scale is i(/mm) = \\\\frac{1}{f(mm)}\\\\left[\\\\frac{180 \\\\times 3600}{\\\\pi}\\\\right]. The derivation of this equation is fairly straightforward and the result is the same for reflecting or refracting telescopes. However, conceptually it is easier to derive by considering a reflecting telescope. If an extended object with angular size \\\\alpha is observed through a telescope, then due to the Laws of reflection and Trigonometry the size of the image projected onto the focal plane will be s = \\\\tan(\\\\alpha) f. Thefore, the image scale (angular size of object divided by size of projected image) will be i = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{s} = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\tan(\\\\alpha) f}, and by using the small angle relation \\\\tan(a) \\\\approx a, when a << 1 (N.B. only valid if a is in radians), we obtain i = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha f} = \\\\frac{1}{f}. Imperfect images No telescope can form a perfect image. Even if a reflecting telescope could have a perfect mirror, or a refracting telescope could have a perfect lens, the effects of aperture diffraction are unavoidable. In reality, perfect mirrors and perfect lenses do not exist, so image aberrations in addition to aperture diffraction must be taken into account. Image aberrations can be broken down into two main classes, monochromatic, and polychromatic. In 1857, Philipp Ludwig von Seidel (1821‚Äì1896) decomposed the first order monochromatic aberrations into five constituent aberrations. They are now commonly referred to as the five Seidel Aberrations. =The five Seidel aberrations= ; Spherical aberration : The difference in focal length between paraxial rays and marginal rays, proportional to the square of the objective diameter. ; Coma : A defect by which points appear as comet-like asymmetrical patches of light with tails, which makes measurement very imprecise. Its magnitude is usually deduced from the optical sine theorem. ; Astigmatism : The image of a point forms focal lines at the sagittal and tangental foci and in between (in the absence of coma) an elliptical shape. ; Curvature of Field: The Petzval field curvature means that the image, instead of lying in a plane, actually lies on a curved surface, described as hollow or round. This causes problems when a flat imaging device is used e.g., a photographic plate or CCD image sensor. ; Distortion: Either barrel or pincushion, a radial distortion that must be corrected when combining multiple images (similar to stitching multiple photos into a panoramic photo). Optical defects are always listed in the above order, since this expresses their interdependence as first order aberrations via moves of the exit/entrance pupils. The first Seidel aberration, Spherical Aberration, is independent of the position of the exit pupil (as it is the same for axial and extra-axial pencils). The second, coma, changes as a function of pupil distance and spherical aberration, hence the well-known result that it is impossible to correct the coma in a lens free of spherical aberration by simply moving the pupil. Similar dependencies affect the remaining aberrations in the list. =Chromatic aberrations= : Longitudinal chromatic aberration: As with spherical aberration this is the same for axial and oblique pencils. : Transverse chromatic aberration (chromatic aberration of magnification) Astronomical research telescopes Two of the four Unit Telescopes that make up the ESO's VLT, on a remote mountaintop, 2600 metres above sea level in the Chilean Atacama Desert. Optical telescopes have been used in astronomical research since the time of their invention in the early 17th century. Many types have been constructed over the years depending on the optical technology, such as refracting and reflecting, the nature of the light or object being imaged, and even where they are placed, such as space telescopes. Some are classified by the task they perform such as Solar telescopes. =Large reflectors= Nearly all large research-grade astronomical telescopes are reflectors. Some reasons are: *In a lens the entire volume of material has to be free of imperfection and inhomogeneities, whereas in a mirror, only one surface has to be perfectly polished. *Light of different colors travels through a medium other than vacuum at different speeds. This causes chromatic aberration. *Reflectors work in a wider spectrum of light since certain wavelengths are absorbed when passing through glass elements like those found in a refractor or catadioptric. *There are technical difficulties involved in manufacturing and manipulating large-diameter lenses. One of them is that all real materials sag in gravity. A lens can only be held by its perimeter. A mirror, on the other hand, can be supported by the whole side opposite to its reflecting face. Comparison of nominal sizes of primary mirrors of some notable optical telescopes Most large research reflectors operate at different focal planes, depending on the type and size of the instrument being used. These including the prime focus of the main mirror, the cassegrain focus (light bounced back down behind the primary mirror), and even external to the telescope all together (such as the Nasmyth and coud√© focus). A new era of telescope making was inaugurated by the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT), with a mirror composed of six segments synthesizing a mirror of 4.5 meters diameter. This has now been replaced by a single 6.5 m mirror. Its example was followed by the Keck telescopes with 10 m segmented mirrors. The largest current ground-based telescopes have a primary mirror of between 6 and 11 meters in diameter. In this generation of telescopes, the mirror is usually very thin, and is kept in an optimal shape by an array of actuators (see active optics). This technology has driven new designs for future telescopes with diameters of 30, 50 and even 100 meters. Harlan J. Smith Telescope reflecting telescope at McDonald Observatory, Texas Relatively cheap, mass- produced ~2 meter telescopes have recently been developed and have made a significant impact on astronomy research. These allow many astronomical targets to be monitored continuously, and for large areas of sky to be surveyed. Many are robotic telescopes, computer controlled over the internet (see e.g. the Liverpool Telescope and the Faulkes Telescope North and South), allowing automated follow-up of astronomical events. Initially the detector used in telescopes was the human eye. Later, the sensitized photographic plate took its place, and the spectrograph was introduced, allowing the gathering of spectral information. After the photographic plate, successive generations of electronic detectors, such as the charge-coupled device (CCDs), have been perfected, each with more sensitivity and resolution, and often with a wider wavelength coverage. Current research telescopes have several instruments to choose from such as: *imagers, of different spectral responses *spectrographs, useful in different regions of the spectrum *polarimeters, that detect light polarization. The phenomenon of optical diffraction sets a limit to the resolution and image quality that a telescope can achieve, which is the effective area of the Airy disc, which limits how close two such discs can be placed. This absolute limit is called the diffraction limit (and may be approximated by the Rayleigh criterion, Dawes limit or Sparrow's resolution limit). This limit depends on the wavelength of the studied light (so that the limit for red light comes much earlier than the limit for blue light) and on the diameter of the telescope mirror. This means that a telescope with a certain mirror diameter can theoretically resolve up to a certain limit at a certain wavelength. For conventional telescopes on Earth, the diffraction limit is not relevant for telescopes bigger than about 10 cm. Instead, the seeing, or blur caused by the atmosphere, sets the resolution limit. But in space, or if adaptive optics are used, then reaching the diffraction limit is sometimes possible. At this point, if greater resolution is needed at that wavelength, a wider mirror has to be built or aperture synthesis performed using an array of nearby telescopes. In recent years, a number of technologies to overcome the distortions caused by atmosphere on ground-based telescopes have been developed, with good results. See adaptive optics, speckle imaging and optical interferometry.

As the fifth son of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover, initially he seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but none of his elder brothers had a legitimate son. Ernest succeeded in Hanover under Salic law, which barred women from the succession, ending the personal union between Britain and Hanover that had begun in 1714. Ernest was born in London but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. He was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale in 1799. Although his mother Queen Charlotte disapproved of his marriage in 1815 to her twice-widowed niece, Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved happy. The King's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales (later King George IV), had one child, Charlotte, who was expected to become the British queen, but she died in 1817, giving Ernest some prospect of succeeding to the British throne as well as the Hanoverian one. However, his older brother Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British heir, Victoria, in 1819 shortly before the birth of Ernest's only child, George. Ernest was an active member of the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet, had fathered a son by his sister Sophia, and intended to take the British throne by murdering Victoria. Following the death of his brother King William IV, Ernest became Hanover's first resident ruler since George I. He had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy near its start when he dismissed the G√∂ttingen Seven, including the Brothers Grimm, from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies. A revolution in 1848 was quickly put down in Hanover. The kingdom joined the German customs union in 1850 despite Ernest's reluctance. He died the next year and was succeeded by his son George.  Early life (1771‚Äì1799)  The young Ernest Augustus by Thomas Gainsborough, 1782 Ernest Augustus, the fifth son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, was born at Buckingham House, London, on 5 June 1771, and baptised on 1 July 1771 at St James's Palace. After leaving the nursery, he lived with his two younger brothers, Prince Adolphus (later Duke of Cambridge) and Prince Augustus (later Duke of Sussex), and a tutor in a house on Kew Green, near his parents' residence at Kew Palace. Though the King never left England in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in their adolescence. According to the historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers. At the age of fifteen, Prince Ernest and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of G√∂ttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover. Ernest proved a keen student and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, he attended lectures at the university. Though King George ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines and that they follow the university's rules, the merchants of the Electorate proved willing to extend credit to the princes and all three fell into debt. Colourised sketch of Ernest by James Gillray, 1799. Unusually, this depicts Ernest's disfigured left profile; most later portraits either show his right profile or omit the disfigurement. In 1790, Ernest asked his father for permission to train with Prussian forces. Instead, in January 1791, he and Prince Adolphus were sent to Hanover to receive military training under the supervision of Field Marshal Wilhelm von Freytag. Before leaving G√∂ttingen, Ernest penned a formal letter of thanks to the university and wrote to his father, \\"I should be one of the most ungrateful of men if ever I was forgetful of all I owe to G√∂ttingen & its professors.\\" As a lieutenant, Ernest learned cavalry drill and tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons and proved to be an excellent horseman, as well as a good shot. After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry. In March 1792, the King commissioned Prince Ernest Augustus as a colonel into the 9th Hanoverian Light Dragoons. The Prince served in the Low Countries in the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian and Austrian forces. Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre wound to the head, which resulted in a disfiguring scar. During the Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794, his left arm was injured by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in his left eye faded. In June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his first stay there since 1786. Ernest resumed his duties in early November, by now promoted to major-general. He hoped his new rank would bring him a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as the Allied armies retreated slowly through the Netherlands towards Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, holding several unimportant postings. He had requested a return home to seek treatment for his eye, but it was not until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain. There, Prince Ernest consulted a notable eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found his condition inoperable, as no operation took place. Once back in Britain, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join the British forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused him permission. Ernest did not want to rejoin the Hanoverian forces, as they were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, Freytag was seriously ill and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, Count von Wallmoden.  Duke of Cumberland  = Military commander = On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh, and was granted an allowance of ¬£12,000 a year. Though he was made a lieutenant-general, of both British and Hanoverian forces, he remained in England and, with a seat in the House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views and soon became a leader of the right wing of the party. King George had feared that Ernest, like some of his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which led to the formation of the Addington government. In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy arose. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres. Ernest Augustus in an 1823 miniature based on an 1802 portrait by William Beechey. In early 1803, the Duke of York appointed Ernest as commander of the Severn District, in charge of the forces in and around the Severn Estuary. When war with France broke out again after the Peace of Amiens, the Duke appointed Ernest to the more important Southwest District, comprising Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire. Though Ernest would have preferred command of the King's German Legion, composed mostly of expatriates from French-occupied Hanover, he accepted the post. The Duke of Cumberland increased the defences on the South Coast, especially around the town of Weymouth, where his father often spent time in the summer. The 1800 Acts of Union had given Ireland representation in Parliament, but existing law prevented Irish Catholics from serving there because of their religion. \\"Catholic emancipation\\" was a major political issue of the first years of the 19th century. The Duke of Cumberland was a strong opponent of giving political rights to Catholics, believing that emancipation would be a violation of the King's Coronation Oath to uphold Anglicanism and spoke out in the House of Lords against emancipation. Protestant Irish organisations supported the Duke; he was elected Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1805 and Grand Master of the Orange Lodges two years later. The Duke repeatedly sought a post with Allied forces fighting against France, but was sent to the Continent only as an observer. In 1807, he advocated sending British troops to join the Prussians and Swedes in attacking the French at Stralsund (today, in northeastern Germany). The Grenville government refused to send forces. Shortly afterwards, the government fell and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland, agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. However, they were sent too late: the French defeated Prussia and Sweden at the Battle of Stralsund before Ernest and his forces could reach the town. Ernest was promoted to full general of the army in 1808, backdated to 1805. = Sellis incident and Weymouth controversy = In the early hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, awakening him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti- monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study inquest law and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted that the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis. A George Cruikshank cartoon mocking Ernest at the 1815 defeat of his increased allowance. The brown section at lower right covers an image of the ghost of Sellis (visible if enlarged), who hints at the Duke's involvement in his death (Cruikshank self-censored most copies for fear of a libel suit). Much of the public blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious explanations for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had played a part in the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke to the fact that he did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house and assumed the worst. In early 1813, Ernest was involved in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown to be one of three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in an election to the House of Commons, there was considerable controversy and the government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies. Following this, Ernest received ultimate promotion, to Field Marshal, on 26 November 1813. = Marriage = Ernest met and fell in love in mid-1813 with his first cousin, Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Prince Frederick William of Solms- Braunfels and widow of Prince Louis of Prussia. The two agreed to wed if Frederica became free to marry. Her marriage to Frederick William had not been a success; her husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but his sudden death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too convenient and suspected the princess of poisoning her husband. Queen Charlotte opposed the marriage: before the princess had married Frederick William, she had jilted Ernest's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was announced. Following the marriage in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him money and the governorship of Hanover if they would leave for the Continent. Ernest refused and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace for the next three years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by ¬£6,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about ¬£ today), so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes. At the time of the Duke's marriage in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, William, Duke of Clarence, and Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to secure the succession for another generation. Seeing little prospect of the Queen giving in and receiving her daughter-in-law, the Cumberlands moved to Germany in 1818. They had difficulty living within their means in Britain and the cost of living was much lower in Germany. Queen Charlotte died on 17 November 1818, but the Cumberlands remained in Germany, living principally in Berlin, where the Duchess had relatives. In 1817, the Duchess had a stillborn daughter; in 1819 she gave birth to a boy, Prince George of Cumberland. The Duke occasionally visited England, where he stayed with his eldest brother, who in 1820 succeeded to the British and Hanoverian thrones as George IV. George III's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, died six days before his father, but left a daughter, Princess Victoria of Kent. With the death of George III, Ernest became fourth in line to the British throne, following the Duke of York (who would die without legitimate issue in 1827), the Duke of Clarence and Princess Victoria. Returning to England, his political power was again considerable, as it seemed likely that he would succeed to the throne. = Politics and unpopularity = Ernest Augustus wearing the robes of a Knight of the Order of St Patrick Portrait of Ernest Augustus by George Dawe, 1828 In 1826, Parliament finally voted to increase Ernest's allowance. The Liverpool government argued that the Duke needed an increased allowance to pay for Prince George's education; even so, it was opposed by many Whigs. The bill, which passed the House of Commons 120‚Äì97, required Prince George to live in England if the Duke was to receive the money. In 1828, Ernest was staying with the King at Windsor Castle when severe disturbances broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington government announced that it would introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London and was one of the leading opponents to the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George IV against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have had considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have had little support in the Commons and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law. The Wellington government hoped that Ernest would return to Germany, but he moved his wife and son to Britain in 1829. The Times reported that they would live at Windsor in the \\"Devil's Tower\\"; instead, the Duke reopened his house at Kew. They settled there as rumours flew that Thomas Garth, thought to be the illegitimate son of Ernest's sister Princess Sophia, had been fathered by Ernest. It was also said that Ernest had blackmailed the King by threatening to expose this secret, though Van der Kiste points out that Ernest would have been ill-advised to blackmail with a secret which, if exposed, would destroy him. These rumours were spread as Ernest journeyed to London to fight against Catholic emancipation. Whig politician and diarist Thomas Creevey wrote about the Garth rumour in mid-February and there is some indication the rumours began with Princess Lieven, wife of the Russian ambassador. Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, that the Duke had been thrown out of Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst. In early 1830, a number of newspapers printed articles hinting that Ernest was having an affair with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen, now past fifty. In February 1830, Lord Graves, Ernest's lord of the bedchamber and comptroller of his household, wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death (and the day after the inquest), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide‚Äîor guilty of a second murder. The Duke later stated that he had been \\"accused of every crime in the decalogue\\". Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intention to return to Britain that \\"a campaign of unparalleled viciousness\\" began against him. The Duke of Wellington once told Charles Greville that George IV had said of Ernest's unpopularity, \\"there was never a father well with his son, or husband with his wife, or lover with his mistress, or a friend with his friend, that he did not try to make mischief between them.\\" According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.

The Duke's influence at Court was ended by the death of George IV in June 1830 and the succession of the Duke of Clarence as William IV. Wellington wrote that \\"the effect of the King's death will ... be to put an end to the Duke of Cumberland's political character and power in this country entirely\\". King William had no legitimate children (two daughters having died in infancy) and Ernest was now heir presumptive in Hanover, since the British heir presumptive, Princess Victoria, as a female could not inherit there. William realised that, so long as the Duke maintained a power base at Windsor, he could wield unwanted influence. The Duke was Gold Stick as head of the Household Cavalry; William made the Duke's post responsible to the Commander in Chief rather than to the King, and an insulted Ernest, outraged at the thought of having to report to an officer junior to himself, resigned. King William again emerged triumphant when the new queen, Adelaide of Saxe- Meiningen, wished to quarter her horses in the stables customarily used by the consort, but which were then occupied by Ernest's horses. Ernest initially refused the King's order to remove the horses, but gave in when told that William's grooms would remove them if Ernest did not move them voluntarily. However, Ernest and William remained friendly throughout the latter's seven- year reign. Ernest's house at Kew was too small for his family; the King gave the Duke and Duchess lifetime residence in a nearby, larger house by the entrance to Kew Gardens. Ernest, who was against the extension of civil and religious liberties, opposed the Reform Act 1832 and was one of the \\"diehard\\" peers who voted against the bill on its final reading in which most Tories abstained under threat of seeing the House of Lords flooded with Whig peers. His unpopularity was deepened by the suggestion that he favoured the creation of Orange lodges in the army. Ernest was the subject of more allegations in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis and the jury found against the author. The Cumberlands suffered further tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye for several years; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped that his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely that George could win Princess Victoria's hand and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover. The Duke spent William's reign in the House of Lords, where he was assiduous in his attendance. Wrote newspaper editor James Grant, \\"He is literally‚Äîthe door-keeper of course excepted‚Äîthe first man in the House and the last out of it. And this not merely generally, but every night.\\" Grant, in his observations of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not noted for his oratory (he delivered no speech longer than five minutes) and had a voice that was difficult to understand, though, \\"his manner is most mild and conciliatory.\\" Grant denigrated the Duke's intellect and influence, but stated that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that \\"he is by no means so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose.\\" Controversy arose in 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges (which took anti-Catholic views) were said to be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of Cumberland on the Throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph Hume, speaking in the House of Commons, Victoria was to be passed over on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity. The Commons passed a resolution calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, \\"I would shed the last drop of my blood for my niece.\\" The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that the Duke intended to murder the Princess and take the British throne for himself.  King of Hanover (1837‚Äì1851)  Coat of arms as King of Hanover (from 1848) = Domestic affairs =  Constitutional controversy  On 20 June 1837, King William IV died; Victoria succeeded him as Queen of the United Kingdom, while Ernest Augustus became King of Hanover. On 28 June 1837, Ernest entered his new domain, passing under a triumphal arch. For the first time in over a century, Hanover would have a ruler living there. Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective and would have preferred the popular viceroy, the Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but both of Ernest's younger brothers refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. According to Roger Fulford in his study of George III's younger sons, Royal Dukes, \\"In 1837, King Ernest was the only male descendant of George III who was willing and able to continue the connection with Hanover.\\" 1849 five-thaler coin depicting King Ernest Augustus Hanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in 1819; this did little more than denote Hanover's change from an electorate to a kingdom, guaranteed by the Congress of Vienna. The Duke of Cambridge, as King William's viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganisation of the Hanoverian government. William IV had given his consent to a new constitution in 1833; the Duke of Cumberland's consent was neither asked nor received, and he had formally protested against the constitution's adoption without his consent. One provision of the constitution transferred the Hanoverian Domains (the equivalent of the British Crown Estate) from the sovereign to the state, eroding the monarch's power. Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the King dissolved the Hanoverian Parliament, which had been convened under the disputed constitution. On 5 July, he proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the grounds that his consent had not been asked and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs. On 1 November 1837, the King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored. His son, Crown Prince George, endorsed the action. In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at G√∂ttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover. Only one of the seven, orientalist Heinrich Ewald, was a citizen of Hanover, and he was not expelled. In the final years of the King's reign, the three were invited to return. The King wrote of the incident to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, \\"If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, I would have had no cause to take exception to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the government had received their protest‚Äîthat is what they have done and that I cannot allow.\\" Ernest received a deputation of G√∂ttingen citizens who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain. In the British House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British king, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British throne by his actions. A more significant protest against the revocation of the 1833 constitution was the refusal of a number of towns to appoint parliamentary deputies. However, by 1840 a sufficient number of deputies had been appointed for the King to summon Parliament, which met for two weeks in August, approving a modified version of the 1819 constitution, passing a budget and sending a vote of thanks to the King. The Parliament met again the following year, passed a three-year budget and adjourned again.  National development and trade; 1848 crisis  At the time the King took the throne, the city of Hanover was a densely packed residential town and did not rise to the grand style of many German capitals. Once the political crises of the first years of his reign had subsided, he set out to remedy this state of affairs. Ernest's support led to gas lighting in the city streets of Hanover, up-to-date sanitation and the development of a new residential quarter. He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica's death, to leave standing the Altes Palais, where the two had lived since arriving in Hanover. Ernest's interest in and support of the railroads led to Hanover becoming a major railway junction, much to the nation's benefit. However, when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal \\"this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this green field\\". The King finally gave his consent in 1844 and the opera house opened in 1852, a year after the King's death. Every week, the King travelled with his secretary to different parts of his kingdom, and anyone could lay a petition before him‚Äîalthough Ernest had petitions screened by the secretary so he would not have to deal with frivolous complaints. Ernest opened high ministerial positions to those of any class, securing the services of several ministers who would not have been eligible without this reform. Though the King had, while Duke of Cumberland, fought against Catholic emancipation in Britain and Ireland, he made no objection to Catholics in government service in Hanover and even visited their churches. Ernest explained this by stating that there were no historical reasons to restrict Catholics in Hanover, as there had been in the United Kingdom. He continued to oppose admission of Jews into the British Parliament, but gave Jews in Hanover equal rights. The King supported a postal union and common currency among the German states, but opposed the Prussian-led customs union, the Zollverein, fearing that it would lead to Prussian dominance and the end of Hanover as an independent state. Instead, the King supported the Steuerverein, which Hanover and other western German states had formed in 1834. When the Steuerverein treaties came up for renewal in 1841, Brunswick pulled out of the union and joined the Zollverein, greatly weakening Hanover's position, especially since Brunswick had enclaves within Hanover. Ernest was able to postpone the enclaves' entry into the Zollverein and, when a trade war began, was able to outlast Brunswick. In 1845, Brunswick, Hanover and Prussia signed a trade agreement. In 1850, Ernest reluctantly permitted Hanover to join the Zollverein, though the entry was on favourable terms. Ernest's forebodings about Prussia were warranted; in 1866, fifteen years after his death, Hanover chose the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War, was defeated and was annexed by Prussia. Hanover was little affected by the revolutions of 1848; a few small disturbances were put down by the cavalry without bloodshed. When agitators arrived from Berlin at the end of May 1848 and there were demonstrations outside the King's palace, Ernest sent out the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister warned that, if the demonstrators made any inappropriate demands on the King, Ernest would pack up his things and leave for Britain, taking the Crown Prince with him. This would leave the country at the mercy of expansionist Prussia and the threat put an end to the agitation. Afterwards, the King granted a new constitution, somewhat more liberal than the 1819 document. = Relations with Britain = British \\"To Hanover\\" token or \\"Cumberland Jack\\", marking Ernest's departure from Britain. These pieces were struck through much of the 19th century as whist counters and were sometimes passed as real gold coins to the unwary. Ernest Augustus is supposed to have asked the advice of the Duke of Wellington as to what course he should take after Victoria's accession, with Wellington supposedly saying \\"Go before you are pelted out.\\" However, Bird dismisses this story as unlikely, given Wellington's customary respect to royalty and the fact that Ernest had little choice in what to do‚Äîhe had to repair to his kingdom as quickly as possible. One decision the new king did have to make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords. Shortly after William's death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign sovereign. The King hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine. Ernest was heir presumptive to Queen Victoria until the birth of her daughter Victoria, Princess Royal, in November 1840. The Lord Privy Seal, Lord Clarendon, wrote, \\"What the country cares about is to have a life more, whether male or female, between the succession and the King of Hanover.\\" Almost immediately upon going to Hanover, the King became involved in a dispute with his niece. Queen Victoria had a strained relationship with her mother Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and wanted to give the Duchess accommodation near her, for the sake of appearances‚Äîbut not too near her. To that end, she asked the King to give up his apartments at St James's Palace in favour of the Duchess. The King, wishing to retain apartments in London in anticipation of frequent visits to England and reluctant to give way in favour of a woman who had frequently fought with his brother, King William, declined and the Queen angrily rented a house for her mother. At a time when the Queen was trying to pay off her father's debts, she saw this as an unnecessary expense. Her ill- feeling towards the King increased when he refused, and advised his two surviving brothers to refuse as well, to give precedence to her intended husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest argued that the standing of the various royal families had been settled at the Congress of Vienna and that the King of Hanover should not have to yield to one whom he described as a \\"paper Royal Highness\\". The act which naturalised Albert as a British subject left the question of his precedence unresolved. Matters came to a head when Ernest returned for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The prince, 48 years Ernest's junior, settled things with what Albert described as a \\"strong push\\" and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred on the grounds that they might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, \\"When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me.\\" Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, \\"Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs.\\" This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, \\"No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!\\" The Queen also recorded that though the King greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak. The King made a point of welcoming British visitors to Hanover and when one Englishwoman told him that she had been lost in the city, the King denied that this was possible, as \\"the whole country is no larger than a fourpenny bit.\\" The monarchs engaged in one more battle‚Äîover jewels left by Queen Charlotte. Queen Victoria, who possessed them, took the position that they belonged to the British Crown. King Ernest maintained that they were to go to the heir male, that is, himself. The matter was arbitrated, and just as the arbitrators were about to announce a decision in Hanover's favour, one of the arbitrators died, voiding the decision. Despite the King's request for a new panel, Victoria refused to permit one during the King's lifetime and took every opportunity to wear the jewels, causing the King to write to his friend, Lord Strangford, \\"The little Queen looked very fine, I hear, loaded down with my diamonds.\\" The King's son and successor, King George V, pressed the matter, and in 1858, after another decision in Hanover's favour, the jewels were turned over to the Hanoverian ambassador.  Later life, death, and memorial  Ernest Augustus portrait, circa 1850 In 1851, the King undertook a number of journeys around Germany. He accepted an invitation from the Queen of Prussia to visit Charlottenburg Palace, near Berlin. He visited Mecklenburg for the christening of the Grand Duke's son and L√ºneburg to inspect his old regiment. In June, Ernest celebrated his 80th birthday by playing host to the King of Prussia. Late that summer, he visited G√∂ttingen, where he opened a new hospital and was given a torchlight procession. The King continued his interest in British affairs and wrote to Lord Strangford about the Great Exhibition of 1851: > The folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this trumpery must strike > every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers > themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the > Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the > occasion. The idea ... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. > But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe. Mausoleum of King Ernest Augustus in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Gardens The King died on 18 November 1851 after an illness of about a month. He was mourned greatly in Hanover; less so in England, where The Times omitted the customary black border to its front page and claimed \\"the good that can be said of the Royal dead is little or none.\\" Both he and Queen Frederica rest in a mausoleum in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Gardens. A large equestrian statue of King Ernest Augustus may be found in a square named after him in front of Hanover Central Station, inscribed with his name and the words (in German) \\"To the father of the nation from his loyal people.\\" It is a popular meeting place; in the local phrase, people arrange to meet unterm Schwanz or \\"under the tail\\" (that is, of the horse which the King rides). Although The Times denigrated Ernest's career as Duke of Cumberland, it did speak well of his time as King of Hanover and of his success in keeping Hanover stable in 1848: > Above all, he possessed a resolute decision of character, which, however > unfortunately it may have operated under different conditions, appeared to > extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by > the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, > resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by > contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind and was prepared to > abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest > maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people > without damage from revolution or reaction.

The rules of chess provide that when stalemate occurs, the game ends as a draw. During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive. Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems. The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn. Some regional chess variants have not allowed a player to play a stalemating move. In losing chess, another chess variant, it is typically treated as a win for the stalemated player. In popular usage, the word stalemate refers to a conflict that has reached an impasse, and in which resolution or further action seems highly difficult or unlikely. Examples With Black to move, Black is stalemated in diagrams 1 to 5. Stalemate is an important factor in the endgame ‚Äì the endgame set-up in diagram 1, for example, quite frequently is relevant in play (see King and pawn versus king endgame). The position in diagram 1 occurred in an 1898 game between Amos Burn and Harry PillsburyBurn vs. Pillsbury, 1898 and also in a 1925 game between Savielly Tartakower and Richard R√©ti.Tartakower vs. R√©ti 1925 The same position, except shifted to the e-, occurred in a 2009 game between Gata Kamsky and Vladimir Kramnik.Kamsky vs. Kramnik The position in diagram 4 is an example of a pawn drawing against a queen. Stalemates of this sort can often save a player from losing an apparently hopeless position (see Queen versus pawn endgame). In that position, even if it were White's move, there is no way to avoid this stalemate without allowing Black's pawn to promote. (White may be able to win the resulting queen versus queen ending, however, if the white king is close enough). In diagram 5, Black had forced the position to become stalemate, seeing that the white bishop could not force the black king to go away from the queening square of the rook pawn. In the endgame As the previous section suggests, stalemate is a typical element of the endgame , often enabling the player with the inferior position to draw the game . Concerning chess, below are some examples of this from actual play. =Anand versus Kramnik= In this game Viswanathan Anand‚ÄìVladimir Kramnik from the 2007 World Chess Championship, Black must capture the pawn on f5, causing stalemate . (Any other move by Black loses.) =Korchnoi versus Karpov= An intentional stalemate occurred on the 124th move of the fifth game of the 1978 World Championship match between Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov.Karpov vs. Korchnoi The game had been a theoretical draw for many moves , . (White's bishop is useless; it cannot defend the queening square at a8 nor attack the black pawn on the light a4-square. If the white king heads towards the black pawn, the black king can move towards a8 and set up a fortress.) The players were not on speaking terms, however, so neither would offer a draw by agreement. Korchnoi said that it gave him pleasure to stalemate Karpov and that it was slightly humiliating . (Incidentally, as of 2014Anand Holds Draw In 2nd-Longest World Championship Game Ever this is the longest game played in a World Chess Championship final match, and also the only World Championship game to end in stalemate before 2007 .) =Bernstein versus Smyslov= { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Bernstein vs. Smyslov, 1946    } Sometimes a surprise stalemate saves a game. In the game between Ossip Bernstein‚ÄìVasily Smyslov (see first diagram), Black should win by sacrificing the f-pawn and using the king to support the b-pawn. However, Smyslov thought it was good to advance the b-pawn, because of the skewer of the white rook if it captures the pawn once it is on b2. Play went: :1... b2 2. Rxb2 Now if 2...Rh2+ 3.Kf3! Rxb2 is stalemate (see analysis diagram). Smyslov moved 2...Kg4 and the game was drawn after 3.Kf1 (see Rook and pawn versus rook endgame) . =Matuloviƒá versus Minev= { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Matuloviƒá vs. Minev, 1956    } In the Bernstein‚ÄìSmyslov game, the possibility of stalemate arose because of a blunder. It can arise without one, as in the game Milan Matuloviƒá‚ÄìNikolay Minev (see first diagram). Play continued: :1. Rc6 Kg5 2. Kh3 Kh5 3. f4 The only meaningful attempt to make progress. Now all black moves (like 3...Ra3+) lose, with one exception. : 3... Rxa6! and now 4.Rxa6 would be stalemate. White played 4.Rc5+ instead, and the game was drawn several moves later . =Williams versus Harrwitz= { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Williams vs. Harrwitz, 1846    } In the game Elijah Williams‚ÄìDaniel Harrwitz (see first diagram), Black was up a knight and a pawn in an endgame. This would normally be a decisive advantage, but Black could find no way to make progress because of various stalemate resources available to White. The game continued: :72... Ra8 73. Rc1 Avoiding the threatened 73...Nc2+. :73... Ke3 74. Rc4 Ra4 75. Rc1 Kd2 76. Rc4 Kd3 76...Nc2+ 77.Rxc2+! Kxc2 is stalemate. :77. Rc3+! Kd4 77...Kxc3 is stalemate. :78. Rc1 Ra3 79. Rd1+ Kc5 79...Rd3 80.Rxd3+! leaves Black with insufficient material to win after 80...Nxd3 81.Kxa2, or a standard fortress in a corner draw after 80...Kxd3. :80. Rc1+ Kb5 81. Rc7 Nd5 82. Rc2 Nc3?? 83. Rb2+ Kc4 84. Rb3! (second diagram) Now the players agreed to a draw, since 84...Kxb3 or 84...Rxb3 is stalemate, as is 84...Ra8 85.Rxc3+! Kxc3. Black could still win the game until his critical mistake on move 82. Instead, 82...Nb4 wins, for example: 83.Rc8 Re3 84.Rb8+ Kc5 85.Rc8+ Kd5 86.Rd8+ Kc6 87.Ra8 Re1+ 88.Kb2 Kc5 89.Kc3 a1=Q+ and wins. =Carlsen versus Van Wely= This 2007 game, Magnus Carlsen‚ÄìLoek van Wely, ended in stalemate. Sixteen-year-old Carlsen used the \\"second-rank defense\\" in a rook and bishop versus rook endgame for 46 moves. The fifty-move rule was about to come into effect, under which Carlsen could claim a draw. The game ended with :109. Rc2‚Äìd2+ Bxd2 stalemate . More complex examples Stalemate can also occur with more pieces on the board. Outside of relatively simple endgame positions, such as those above, stalemate occurs rarely, usually when the side with the superior position has overlooked the possibility of stalemate . This is typically realized by the inferior side's sacrifice of one or more pieces in order to force stalemate. A piece that is offered as a sacrifice to bring about stalemate is sometimes called a desperado. =Evans versus Reshevsky= { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Evans vs. Reshevsky, 1963    } One of the best-known examples of the desperado is the game Larry Evans‚ÄìSamuel Reshevsky that was dubbed \\"The Swindle of the Century\\".Larry Evans, Chess Catechism, Simon and Schuster, 1970, p. 66. SBN 671-21531-0. It appears that Evans himself was the first to refer to the game as the \\"Swindle of the Century\\" in print, in his annotations in American Chess Quarterly magazine, of which he was the Editor-in-Chief. American Chess Quarterly, Vol. 3, No. 3 (Winter, 1964), p. 171. Hans Kmoch referred to the conclusion of the game as \\"A Hilarious Finish\\". Hans Kmoch, \\"United States Championship\\", Chess Review, March 1964, pp. 76‚Äì79, at p. 79. Also available on DVD (p. 89 of \\"Chess Review 1964\\" PDF file). Evans sacrificed his queen on move 49 and offered his rook on move 50. White's rook has been called the eternal rook. Capturing it results in stalemate, but otherwise it stays on the seventh and checks Black's king ad infinitum (i.e. perpetual check). The game would inevitably end in a draw by agreement, by threefold repetition, or by an eventual claim under the fifty-move rule . :47. h4! Re2+ 48. Kh1 Qxg3?? After 48...Qg6! 49.Rf8 Qe6! 50.Rh8+ Kg6, Black remains a piece ahead after 51.Qxe6 Nxe6, or after 51.gxf4 Re1+ and 52...Qa2+.Hans Kmoch, \\"United States Championship\\", Chess Review, March 1964, pp. 76‚Äì79, at p. 79. Also available on DVD (p. 89 of \\"Chess Review 1964\\" PDF file). :49. Qg8+! Kxg8 50. Rxg7+! =Gelfand versus Kramnik= { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Gelfand vs. Kramnik, 1994   } The position at right occurred in Boris Gelfand‚ÄìVladimir Kramnik, 1994 FIDE Candidates match, game 6, in Sanghi Nagar, India. Kramnik, down two pawns and on the defensive, would be very happy with a draw. Gelfand has just played 67. Re4‚Äìe7 (see first diagram), a strong-looking move that threatens 68.Qxf6, winning a third pawn, or 68.Rc7, further constricting Black. Black responded 67... Qc1 If White takes Black's undefended rook with 68.Qxd8, Black's desperado queen forces the draw with 68...Qh1+ 69.Kg3 Qh2+!, compelling 70.Kxh2 stalemate (second diagram). If White avoids the stalemate with 68.Rxg7+ Kxg7 69.Qxd8, Black draws by perpetual check with 69...Qh1+ 70.Kg3 Qg1+ 71.Kf4 Qc1+! 72.Ke4 Qc6+! 73.Kd3 (73.d5 Qc4+; 73.Qd5 Qc2+) Qxf3+! 74.Kd2 Qg2+! 75.Kc3 Qc6+ 76.Kb4 Qb5+ 77.Ka3 Qd3+. Gelfand played 68. d5 instead, but still only drew. =Troitsky versus Vogt= { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Troitsky vs. Vogt, 1896    } In Troitsky‚Äì, 1896, the famous endgame study composer Alexey Troitsky pulled off an elegant swindle in actual play. After Troitsky's 1. Rd1!, Black fell into the trap with the seemingly crushing 1... Bh3?, threatening 2...Qg2#. The game concluded 2. Rxd8+ Kxd8 3. Qd1+! Qxd1 stalemate. White's bishop, knight, and f-pawn are all and unable to move. In studies { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Rhine, 2006    } Stalemate is a frequent theme in endgame studies and other chess compositions. An example is the \\"White to Play and Draw\\" study at right, composed by the American master Frederick RhineUnited States Chess Federation rating card for Frederick S. Rhine and published in 2006 . White saves a draw with 1.Ne5+! Black wins after 1.Nb4+? Kb5! or 1.Qe8+? Bxe8 2.Ne5+ Kb5! 3.Rxb2+ Nb3. 1... Bxe5 After 1...Kb5? 2.Rxb2+ Nb3 3.Rxc4!

Kd8! (rightmost diagram) Black is three pieces ahead, but if White is allowed to take the bishop, the two knights are insufficient to force checkmate. The only way to save the bishop is to move it, resulting in stalemate. A similar idea occasionally enables the inferior side to save a draw in the ending of bishop, knight, and king versus lone king. { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Roycroft, 1957    } At right is a composition by A. J. Roycroft which was published in the British Chess Magazine in 1957. White draws with 1. c7! after which there are two main lines: *1... f5 2. c8=Q (if 2.c8=R? then 2...Bc3 3.Rxc3 Qg7#) 2... Bc3 3.

As in Evans‚ÄìReshevsky, Black cannot escape the \\"eternal rook\\" . In problems Some chess problems require \\"White to move and stalemate Black in n moves\\" (rather than the more common \\"White to move and checkmate Black in n moves\\"). Problemists have also tried to construct the shortest possible game ending in stalemate. Sam Loyd devised one just ten moves long: 1.e3 a5 2.Qh5 Ra6 3.Qxa5 h5 4.Qxc7 Rah6 5.h4 f6 6.Qxd7+ Kf7 7.Qxb7 Qd3 8.Qxb8 Qh7 9.Qxc8 Kg6 10.Qe6 (diagram at left). A similar stalemate is reached after: 1.d4 c5 2.dxc5 f6 3.Qxd7+ Kf7 4.Qxd8 Bf5 5.Qxb8 h5 6.Qxa8 Rh6 7.Qxb7 a6 8.Qxa6 Bh7 9.h4 Kg6 10.Qe6 (Frederick Rhine). Loyd also demonstrated that stalemate can occur with all the pieces on the board: 1.d4 d6 2.Qd2 e5 3.a4 e4 4.Qf4 f5 5.h3 Be7 6.Qh2 Be6 7.Ra3 c5 8.Rg3 Qa5+ 9.Nd2 Bh4 10.f3 Bb3 11.d5 e3 12.c4 f4 (diagram at right). A variation of this game has even occurred in a tournament game.Hohmeister vs. Frank 1993 =Double stalemate= There are peculiar chess compositions featuring double stalemate. At left and at right are double stalemate positions, in which neither side has a legal move. Double stalemate is theoretically possible in a practical game, though is not known to ever have happened. Consider the following position: The game draws after a waiting move like 1.Rg2 (1...b2 2.Rxb2; 1...c2 2.Rg4!). However, White has 1.Rb2?, an interesting blunder: if Black errs by 1...cxb2+? then White draws by 2.Kb1, creating a double stalemate position. Black could win by 1...c2! putting White in zugzwang. The fastest known game ending in a double stalemate position was discovered by Enzo Minerva and published in the Italian newspaper l'Unit√† on 14 August 2007: 1.c4 d5 2.Qb3 Bh3 3.gxh3 f5 4.Qxb7 Kf7 5.Qxa7 Kg6 6.f3 c5 7.Qxe7 Rxa2 8.Kf2 Rxb2 9.Qxg7+ Kh5 10.Qxg8 Rxb1 11.Rxb1 Kh4 12.Qxh8 h5 13.Qh6 Bxh6 14.Rxb8 Be3+ 15.dxe3 Qxb8 16.Kg2 Qf4 17.exf4 d4 18.Be3 dxe3.The previous record (37 ply, i.e. 18.5 moves) was held by the German composer Eduard Schildberg, and was published in the Deutsches Wochenschach in 1915. History of the stalemate rule The stalemate rule has had a convoluted history . Although today stalemate is universally recognized as a draw, for much of the game's history that has not been the case. In the forerunners to modern chess, such as chaturanga, stalemate was a win for the side administering it. This practice persisted in chess as played in early 15th- century Spain . However, Lucena (c. 1497) treated stalemate as an inferior form of victory , which in games played for money won only half the stake, and this continued to be the case in Spain as late as 1600 . The rule in England from about 1600 to 1800 was that stalemate was a loss for the player administering it, a rule that the eminent chess historian H. J. R. Murray believes may have been adopted from Russian chess . That rule disappeared in England before 1820, being replaced by the French and Italian rule that a stalemate was a drawn game . Assume that Black is stalemated. Throughout history, such a stalemate has at various times been: *A win for White in 10th century Arabia and parts of medieval Europe . *A half-win for White. In a game played for stakes, White would win half the stake (18th century Spain) . *A win for Black in 9th century India , 17th century Russia , on the Central Plain of Europe in the 17th century , and 17th‚Äì18th century England .Saul's Famous game of Chesse-play (London 1614) explained the reason for this rule as follows: \\"He that hath put his adversary's King into a stale, loseth the game, because he hath disturbed the course of the game, which can only end with the grand Check-mate.\\" Murray, p. 466 & n. 32. McCrary, p. 26. Murray derides the rule as \\"illogical\\", Murray, p. 61, and Saul's explanation as \\"puerile\\", id., p. 466. This rule continued to be published in Hoyle's Games Improved as late as 1866 .Murray wrote in 1913, \\"The rule still appeared in editions after 1857, and I have met with players who argued that the rule was so.\\" Murray, p. 391 n. 47. *Illegal. If White made a move that would stalemate Black, he had to retract it and make a different move (Eastern Asia until the early 20th century). Murray likewise wrote that in Hindustani chess and Parsi chess, two of the three principal forms of chess played in India as of 1913 , a player was not allowed to play a move that would stalemate the opponent . The same was true of Burmese chess, another chess variant, at the time of writing . Stalemate was not permitted in most of the Eastern Asiatic forms of the game (specifically in Burma, India, Japan, and Siam) until early in the 20th century . *The forfeiture of Black's turn to move (medieval France) , although other medieval French sources treat stalemate as a draw . *A draw. This was the rule in 13th-century Italy and also stated in the German Cracow Poem (1422), that noted, however, that some players treated stalemate as equivalent to checkmate . This rule was ultimately adopted throughout Europe, but not in England until the 19th century, after being introduced there by Jacob Sarratt . Proposed rule change Periodically, writers have argued that stalemate should again be made a win for the side causing the stalemate. Grandmaster Larry Kaufman writes, \\"In my view, calling stalemate a draw is totally illogical, since it represents the ultimate zugzwang, where any move would get your king taken\\" . The British master T. H. Tylor argued in a 1940 article in the British Chess Magazine that the present rule, treating stalemate as a draw, \\"is without historical foundation and irrational, and primarily responsible for a vast percentage of draws, and hence should be abolished\\" . Years later, Fred Reinfeld wrote, \\"When Tylor wrote his attack on the stalemate rule, he released about his unhappy head a swarm of peevish maledictions that are still buzzing.\\" Larry Evans calls the proposal to make stalemate a win for the stalemating player a \\"crude proposal that ... would radically alter centuries of tradition and make chess boring\\" . This rule change would cause a greater emphasis on ; an extra pawn would be a greater advantage than it is today. =Effect on endgame theory= If stalemate were a loss for the player unable to move, the outcome of some endgames would be affected. In some situations the superior side can force stalemate but not checkmate. In others, the defending player can use stalemate as a defensive technique to avoid losing (under the current rule). If the proposed rule change were made, both of these situations would become wins for the superior side instead of draws. *The endgame of king and pawn versus king would always be a win unless the pawn can be captured. If the pawn cannot be captured or promoted, the defending king can be forced into a stalemate (see diagram 1 below). *Two knights and a king can stalemate a lone king , so that ending would no longer be a draw (see Two knights endgame). *A plus a bishop on the color opposite the pawn's queening square would be a win instead of a draw, because the defending king can be forced into stalemate (see diagram 2 below). (See Wrong rook pawn). *A king and rook versus a king and bishop would be a win for the side with the rook because of a forced stalemate (see diagram 3 below). (The same is not true for a rook versus knight.) *If the defending king is cornered, a single bishop or knight may be able to stalemate the king, although these cannot be forced in general. *The defensive drawing techniques with a or on the seventh with its king nearby versus a queen would not work, because they rely on stalemate . (See Queen versus pawn endgame.) *Positions such as the Saavedra position, which would normally require an underpromotion due to the fact that a queen would stalemate the opponent, no longer require an underpromotion. (In fact, underpromotion to rook or bishop would no longer be necessary in chess.) Rules in other chess variants Not all variants of chess consider the stalemate to be a draw. Many regional variants, as well some variants of Western chess, have adopted their own rules on how to treat the stalemated player. In chaturanga, which is widely considered to be the common ancestor of all variants of chess, a stalemate was a win for the stalemated player .Chaturangs ‚Äì Game rules Around the 7th century, this game was adopted in the Middle East as shatranj with very similar rules to its predecessor; however, the stalemate rule was changed to its exact opposite: i.e. it was a win for the player delivering the stalemate.Shatranj This game was in turn introduced to the western world, where it would eventually evolve to modern-day (Western) chess, although the stalemate rule for Western chess was not standardised as a draw until the 19th century (see history of the rule). =Modern Asian variants= Chaturanga also evolved into several other games in various regions of Asia, all of which have varying rules on stalemating: * In makruk (Thai chess), a stalemate results in a draw, like in Western chess.Makruk: Thai chess * In shogi (Japanese chess) and the majority of its variants, a stalemate is a win for the player delivering the stalemate.Rules ‚Äì Japanese Game Shogi This is because historically, the objective of shogi was to capture the opponent's king rather than to checkmate it ‚Äì thus from the players' perspective a stalemate was no different from a checkmate, as both outcomes would result in the king's capture in the next move. The official rules of shogi (but not most of its variants) have since altered the objective of the game to checkmate, however stalemate is still considered a form of checkmate and thus a win for the stalemating player. It is worth noting, though, that in shogi (and indeed in any variant of the game that features the drop rule), stalemates are extremely rare due to the fact that no piece ever goes entirely out of play. * Xiangqi (Chinese chess) and janggi (Korean chess), despite being very similar to each other in terms of both the board and the pieces, have adopted different rules for what happens in the case of a stalemate. In xiangqi, like in shogi, it results in an immediate loss for the stalemated player, and there is no explicit distinction between it and checkmate.BrainKing ‚Äì Game rules (Chinese Chess) Janggi, on the other hand, allows the stalemated player to pass his/her turn, i.e. the player may (and in fact must) leave the \\"king\\" in position and make no move when stalemated.Janggi ‚Äì Korean Chess * In sittuyin (Myanma/Burmese chess), stalemates are avoided altogether, as it is counted as an illegal move. Players are not allowed to leave the opponent with no legal moves without putting the king into check.How to Play Sittuyin ‚Äì Burmese Chess ‚Äì Myanmar Chess =Western chess variants= The majority of variants of Western chess do not specify in their set of rules what happens when a player is stalemated, which would imply that the rule is the same as in standard Western chess, i.e. a draw. There are some variants, however, where the rule is specified and differs from the rules of standard chess: * In losing chess, the stalemate rule varies depending on the version being played . According to the \\"international\\" rules, a stalemate is simply a win for the stalemated player. The Free Internet Chess Server, however, grants a win to the player with fewer pieces remaining on the board (regardless of who delivered the stalemate); if both players have the same number of pieces it is a draw.Losing Chess There is also a \\"joint\\" FICS/international rule, according to which a stalemate is only a win if both sources agree that it is a win (i.e. it counts as a win for the stalemated player if that player also happens to have fewer pieces remaining); in all other cases it is a draw. * In Gli≈Ñski's hexagonal chess, stalemate is neither a draw nor a full win. Instead, in tournament games, the player who delivers the stalemate earns point, while the stalemated player receives point.Gli≈Ñski's Hexagonal Chess It is unknown whether a stalemate should be considered a draw or a win in a friendly game. As a metaphor Stalemate has become a widely used metaphor for other situations where there is a conflict or contest between two parties, such as war or political negotiations, and neither side is able to achieve victory, resulting in what is also called an impasse, a deadlock, or a Mexican standoff. Chess writers note that this usage is a misnomer because, unlike in chess, the situation is often a temporary one that is ultimately resolved, even if it seems currently intractable .Golombek wrote, \\"The word 'stalemate' has been taken into the English language to mean (wrongly) a temporary state of impasse.\\" Soltis wrote: > There is a world of difference between no choice ... and a poor choice. > Editorial writers often talk about a political stalemate when the analogy > they probably have in mind is a political \\"zugzwang\\". In stalemate a player > has no legal moves, period. In zugzwang he has nothing pleasant to do.

Buddleia) (; also historically given as Buddlea) is a genus comprising over 140 species of flowering plants endemic to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The generic name bestowed by Linnaeus posthumously honoured the Reverend Adam Buddle (1662‚Äì1715), an English botanist and rector, at the suggestion of Dr. William Houstoun. Houstoun sent the first plants to become known to science as buddleja (B. americana) to England from the Caribbean about 15 years after Buddle's death. Nomenclature The botanic name has been the source of some confusion. By modern practice of botanical Latin, the spelling of a generic name made from 'Buddle' would be Buddleia, but Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum of 1753 and 1754 spelled it Buddleja, with the long i between two vowels, common in early modern orthography.Linnaei, C. (1753). Species plantarum. Impensis Laurentii Salvii, Stockholm. The pronunciation of the long i in Buddleja as j is a common modern error. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature has gradually changed to incorporate stricter rules about orthographic variants and as of the 2006 edition requires (article 60, particularly 60.5) that Linnaeus' spelling should be followed in this case.. Classification The genus Buddleja is now included in Scrophulariaceae, having earlier been classified under Buddlejaceae (synonym: Oftiaceae) and Loganiaceae Description Of the approximately 140 species, nearly all are shrubs less than tall, but a few qualify as trees, the largest reaching . Both evergreen and deciduous species occur, in tropical and temperate regions resp. The leaves are lanceolate in most species, and arranged in opposite pairs on the stems (alternate in one species, B. alternifolia); they range from long. The flowers of the Asiatic species are mostly produced in terminal panicles long; the American species more commonly as cymes forming small, globose heads. Each individual flower is tubular and divided into four spreading lobes (petals) about across, the corolla length ranging from around 10 mm in the Asiatics to 3‚Äì30 mm in the American species, the wider variation in the latter because some South American species have evolved long red flowers to attract hummingbirds, rather than insects, as exclusive pollinators. The colour of the flowers varies widely, from mostly pastel pinks and blues in Asia, to vibrant yellows and reds in the New World, while many cultivars have deeper tones. The flowers are generally rich in nectar and often strongly honey-scented. The fruit is a small capsule about long and diameter, containing numerous small seeds; in a few species (previously classified in the separate genus Nicodemia) the capsule is soft and fleshy, forming a berry. Distribution The genus is found in four continents. Over 60 species are native through the New World from the southern United States south to Chile, while many other species are found in the Old World, in Africa, and parts of Asia, but all are absent as natives from Europe and Australasia. The species are divided into three groups based on their floral type: those in the New World are mostly dioecious (occasionally hermaphrodite or trioecious), while those in the Old World are exclusively hermaphrodite with perfect flowers. Cultivation and uses As garden shrubs buddlejas are essentially 20th-century plants, with the exception of B. globosa which was introduced to Britain from southern Chile in 1774 and disseminated from the nursery of Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. \\"Buddleia\\". Several species are popular garden plants, the species are commonly known as 'butterfly bushes' owing to their attractiveness to butterflies, and have become staples of the modern butterfly garden; they are also attractive to bees and moths. The most popular cultivated species is Buddleja davidii from central China, named for the French Basque missionary and naturalist P√®re Armand David. Other common garden species include the aforementioned B. globosa, grown for its strongly honey-scented orange globular inflorescences, and the weeping Buddleja alternifolia. Several interspecific hybrids have been made, notably B. 'Lochinch' (B. davidii √ó B. fallowiana) and B. √ó weyeriana (B. globosa √ó B. davidii), the latter a cross between a South American and an Asiatic species. Some species commonly escape from the garden. B. davidii in particular is a great coloniser of dry open ground; in urban areas in the United Kingdom, it often self-sows on waste ground or old masonry, where it grows into a dense thicket, and is listed as an invasive species in many areas. It is frequently seen beside railway lines, on derelict factory sites and, in the aftermath of World War II, on urban bomb sites. This earned it the popular nickname of 'the bombsite plant' among the war-time generation. Popular garden cultivars include 'Royal Red' (reddish- purple flowers), 'Black Knight' (very dark purple), 'Sungold' (golden yellow), and 'Pink Delight' (pure pink). In recent years, much breeding work has been undertaken to create small, more compact buddlejas, such as 'Blue Chip' which reach no more than tall, and which are also seed sterile, an important consideration in the US where B. davidii and its cultivars are banned from many states owing to their invasiveness.

It consisted of the nearly-three-year siege of the Carthaginian capital, Carthage (a little north east of modern Tunis). In 149 BC a large Roman army landed at Utica in North Africa. The Carthaginians hoped to appease the Romans, but despite the Carthaginians surrendering all of their weapons, the Romans pressed on to besiege the city of Carthage. The Roman campaign suffered repeated setbacks through 149 BC, only alleviated by Scipio Aemilianus, a middle-ranking officer, distinguishing himself several times. A new Roman commander took over in 148 BC, and fared equally badly. At the annual election of Roman magistrates in early 147 BC public support for Scipio was so great that the usual age restrictions were lifted to allow him to be appointed consul and commander in Africa. Scipio's term commenced with two Carthaginian successes, but he tightened the siege and commenced a construction of a large mole to prevent supplies from getting into Carthage via blockade runners. The Carthaginians had partially rebuilt their fleet and it sortied, to the Romans' surprise; after an indecisive engagement the Carthaginians mismanaged their withdrawal and lost many ships. The Romans then built a large brick structure in the harbour area which dominated the city wall. In the spring of 146 BC the Romans launched their final assault and over seven days systematically destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants; only on the last day did they take prisoners50,000, who were sold into slavery. The formerly Carthaginian territories became the Roman province of Africa with Utica as its capital. It was a century before the site of Carthage was rebuilt as a Roman city. Primary sources The source for most aspects of the Punic Wars (the term Punic comes from the Latin word Punicus (or Poenicus), meaning \\"Carthaginian\\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' Phoenician ancestry.) is the historian Polybius ( ‚Äì ). His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is best-known for The Histories, written sometime after 146 BC. He accompanied his patron and friend, the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus, in North Africa during the Third Punic War, during which the siege of Carthage took place; the modern consensus is that this proximity causes the normally reliable Polybius to recount Scipio's actions in an excessively favourable light. In addition, significant portions of The Histories account of the Third Punic War have been lost. The account of the Roman historian Livy, who relied heavily on Polybius, is much used by modern historians of the Punic Wars, but after 167 BC it has survived only as a list of its contents. Other ancient historians whose accounts of the Third Punic War or its participants have also been largely lost include Plutarch, Dio Cassius and the Sicilian Greek Diodorus Siculus. The account of the 2nd century CE Greek historian Appian has survived and is relied on by modern historians. The modern historian Bernard Mineo states that it \\"is the only complete and continuous account of [the Third Punic War]\\". It is thought to have been largely based on Polybius's account, but a number of problems with it have been identified. These issues mean that information on the siege of Carthage is less certain than is usual for the Punic wars. Other sources include coins, inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions. Background Carthage and Rome fought the 17-year-long Second Punic War between 218 and 201 BC which ended with a Roman victory. The peace treaty imposed on the Carthaginians stripped them of all of their overseas territories, and some of their African ones. An indemnity of 10,000 silver talents was to be paid over 50 years. Hostages were taken. Carthage was forbidden to possess war elephants and its fleet was restricted to 10 warships. It was prohibited from waging war outside Africa, and in Africa only with Rome's express permission. It was clear that Carthage was now politically subordinate to Rome. At the end of the war, the Roman ally Masinissa emerged as by far the most powerful ruler amongst the Numidians, the dominant indigenous people in North Africa west of Egypt. Over the following fifty years, he repeatedly took advantage of Carthage's inability to protect its possessions. Whenever Carthage petioned Rome for redress, or permission to take military action, Rome backed its ally Masinissa, and refused. Masinissa's seizures of, and raids into Carthaginian territory became increasingly flagrant. In 151 BC, Carthage raised a large army commanded by Hasdrubal, and, the treaty notwithstanding, counterattacked the Numidians. The campaign ended in disaster, and the army surrendered; a large number of Carthaginians were subsequently massacred by the Numidians. Hasdrubal escaped to Carthage, where, in an attempt to placate Rome, he was condemned to death. Carthage had paid off its indemnity and was prospering economically, but was no military threat to Rome. Nevertheless, elements in the Roman Senate had long wished to destroy Carthage, and, using the illicit Carthaginian military action as pretext, began preparing a punitive expedition. Carthaginian embassies attempted to negotiate with Rome, but when the large North African port city of Utica went over to Rome in 149 BC, the Senate and the People's Assembly declared war. It was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead an army. A large Roman army landed at Utica in 149 BC under both consuls for the year: Manius Manilius commanding the army, and Lucius Censorinus the fleet. The Carthaginians continued to attempt to appease Rome, and sent an embassy to Utica. The consuls demanded, that Carthaginians hand over all weaponry, which they reluctantly did. Large convoys took enormous stocks of equipment from Carthage to Utica. Surviving records state, that these included 200,000 sets of armour and 2,000 catapults. Their warships all sailed to Utica, and were burnt in the harbour. Once Carthage was disarmed, the consuls made the further demand, that the Carthaginians abandon their city and relocate away from the sea; Carthage would then be destroyed. The Carthaginians abandoned negotiations and prepared to defend their city.  Opposing forces  The city of Carthage itself was unusually large for the time, with a population estimated at 700,000. It was strongly fortified with walls of more than circumference. Defending the main approach from the land were three lines of defences, of which the strongest was a brick-built wall wide and high with a ditch in front of it. Built into this wall was a barracks capable of holding over 24,000 soldiers. The city had few reliable sources of ground water, but possessed a complex system to catch and channel rainwater and a large number of cisterns to store it. The Carthaginians raised a strong and enthusiastic force to garrison the city from their citizenry and by freeing all slaves willing to fight. They also formed a large strong field army, commanded by Hasdrubal, freshly released from his condemned cell. This army was based at Nepheris, south of the city. Appian gives the strength of the Roman army which landed in Africa as 84,000 soldiers; modern historians estimate it at 40,000‚Äì50,000 men, of whom 4,000 were cavalry. Course of the war = 149 BC = The Roman army moved to Carthage and twice attempted to scale the city walls, from the sea and the landward sides, being repulsed both times, before settling down for a siege. Hasdrubal moved up his army and harassed the Roman supply lines and foraging parties. The Romans built two very large battering rams and partially broke down a section of the wall. They stormed the breach but fell into disorder while clambering through and were thrown back by the waiting Carthaginians. The Romans would have been in difficulty except for the actions of Scipio Aemilianus, who was serving with the 4th Legion as a tribunea middle-ranking military position. Rather than join the attack as ordered, Scipio held back and spaced his men along the partially demolished wall, and so was able to beat off the pursuing Carthaginians when the Romans in front of him fled back through the ranks of his unit. Censorinus's camp, the primary role of which was to protect the beached Roman ships, was badly situated and by early summer was so pestiferous that it was moved to a healthier location. This, however, was not as defensible, and the Carthaginians inflicted losses on the Roman fleet with fireships. Separately, a night attack was launched against Manilius's camp; a dangerous outcome for the Romans was again averted by Scipio. He promptly led a force of cavalry out of the rear of the camp, around it in the dark and attacked the Carthaginians in the flank; driving them off in confusion. The Romans made repetitions of these attacks more difficult by building additional field fortifications. = 148 BC = The Romans elected two new consuls in 148 BC, but only one of them was sent to Africa: Calpurnius Piso; Lucius Mancinius commanded the navy as his subordinate. He pulled back the close siege of Carthage to a looser blockade and attempted to mop up the other Carthaginian- supporting cities in the area; he failed. Meanwhile, Hasdrubal, commander of the Carthaginian field army, overthrew the civilian leadership of Carthage and took command himself. A Numidian chief came over to the Carthaginians with 800 cavalry. Carthage allied with Andriscus, a pretender to the Macedonian throne, who invaded Roman Macedonia, defeated a Roman army, had himself crowned King Philip VI, and sparked the Fourth Macedonian War. = 147 BC = Scipio intended to stand in the 147 BC elections for the post of ; this was a natural progression for him and at age 36 or 37 he was too young to stand as consul, for which the minimum age requirement was 41. But the public demand to appoint him as consul, and so allow him to take charge of the African war, was so strong that the Senate put aside the age requirements for all posts for the year. There was considerable political manoeuvring behind the scenes, much of which is opaque in the sources, and it is not known to what extent, if any, Scipio helped orchestrate this outcome. In any event, he secured sole command in Africa, the usual right to conscript enough men to make up the numbers of the forces there and the unusual entitlement to enrol volunteers. Meanwhile, early in 147 BC Mancinius seized an unexpected opportunity to capture a sally port and forced 3,500 men into the city; 3,000 of whom were lightly-armed and armoured sailors. Mancinius sent messages asking for reinforcements. The primary sources have Scipio arriving at Utica that evening to take up his post. He sailed overnight for Carthage and arrived just in time to evacuate Mancinius's hard-pressed force as it was expelled by a Carthaginian counter attack. Scipio moved the Romans' main camp back to near Carthage, closely observed by a Carthaginian detachment of 8,000. He made a speech demanding tighter discipline and dismissed those soldiers he considered ill disciplined or poorly motivated. He then led a night march with a strong force that culminated in an assault against what the Romans considered to be a weak point in Carthage's main wall. A gate was seized and 4,000 Romans pushed into the city. Panicked in the dark, the Carthaginian defenders, after an initial fierce resistance, fled. However, Scipio decided that his position would be indefensible once the Carthaginians reorganised themselves in daylight, and so withdrew. Hasdrubal, horrified at the way the Carthaginian defences had collapsed, had Roman prisoners tortured to death on the walls, in view of the Roman army. He was reinforcing the will to resist in the Carthaginian citizens; from this point there could be no possibility of negotiation or even surrender. Some members of the city council denounced his actions and Hasdrubal had them too put to death and took full control of the city. The renewed close siege cut off landward entry to the city, but a tight seaward interdiction was all but impossible with the naval technology of the time. Frustrated at the amount of food being shipped into the city Scipio started to build an immense mole to cut off access to the harbour. As work on this progressed the Carthaginians responded by cutting a new channel from their harbour to the sea. They had built a new fleet of 50 triremesmedium-sized, manoeuvrable, oared warshipsand a large number of smaller ships since sacrificing their original fleet two years before. Once the channel was complete this sailed out, taking the Romans by surprise. A few days were necessary to trim the new-built ships and to train the new crews who had not been to sea for over two years and were out of the habit of operating together. By the time the Carthaginians felt ready to give battle the Romans had concentrated their own naval forces. In the engagement which followed the Carthaginians held their own, with their lighter craft proving difficult for the Roman ships to deal with. Breaking off the engagement the Carthaginian triremes were covering the withdrawal of their lighter vessels when a collision blocked the new channel. With the Carthaginian ships pinned against the city's sea wall with no room to manoeuvre the Romans sank or captured many of them before the blockage was cleared and the Carthaginian survivors were able to escape back into harbour. The Romans now attempted to advance against the Carthaginian defences in the harbour area. Carthaginians swam across the harbour at night and set fire to several siege engines and many legionaries panicked and fled. Scipio intercepted them in the dark; when they disregarded his orders to halt he had his mounted bodyguard attack them. Nevertheless, the Romans eventually gained control of the quay and built a brick structure as high as the city wall. This took months to complete, but once in place it enabled 4,000 Romans to fire onto the Carthaginian ramparts from short range. = 146 BC = Scipio's position as the Roman commander in Africa was extended for a year in 146 BC, and in the spring he launched the final assault. It came from the harbour area and Hasdrubal, expecting it, set fire to the nearby warehouses. Despite this, a Roman advance party broke through to the military harbour and captured it. The main assault force reached the city's public square, where the legions camped overnight. The next morning Scipio led 4,000 men to link up with the group at the military harbour; this group was delayed when they diverted to strip the gold from the Temple of Apollo. Scipio and his officers were helpless to prevent them and furious. The Carthaginians did not take advantage, having withdrawn to defensive positions. Having regrouped, the Romans systematically worked their way through the residential part of the city, killing everyone they encountered and firing the buildings behind them. At times the Romans progressed from rooftop to rooftop, to prevent missiles being hurled down on them. It took six more days to clear the city of resistance, and on the last day Scipio agreed to accept prisoners. The last holdouts, including 900 Roman deserters in Carthaginian service, fought on from the Temple of Eshmoun and burnt it down around themselves when all hope was gone. At this point Hasdrubal surrendered to Scipio on the promise of his life and freedom. Hasdrubal's wife, watching from a rampart, then blessed Scipio, cursed her husband, and walked into the temple with her children, to burn to death. Polybius recounts how he personally observed the final destruction, alongside Scipio, who \\"reflecting upon the inevitable fall of cities, peoples and empires\\" said to Polybius that \\"I feel a terror and a dread, lest someone some day gives the same order about my own native city\\", i.e. Rome. There were 50,000 Carthaginian prisoners, a small proportion of the pre-war population, who were sold into slavery. The site was cursed () with the intention of preventing it ever being resettled; the notion that Roman forces then sowed the city with salt is a 19th-century invention. Many of the religious items and cult-statues which Carthage had pillaged from Sicilian cities and temples over the centuries were returned with great ceremony. Aftermath Scipio was awarded the \\"Africanus\\", as his adoptive grandfather had been. The formerly Carthaginian territories were annexed by Rome and reconstituted to become the Roman province of Africa with Utica as its capital. The province became a major source of grain and other foodstuffs. Numerous large Punic cities, such as those in Mauretania, were taken over by the Romans, although they were permitted to retain their Punic system of government. A century later, the site of Carthage was rebuilt as a Roman city by Julius Caesar, and would become one of the main cities of Roman Africa by the time of the Empire. The Punic language continued to be spoken in north Africa until the 7th century. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy; the ruins of Carthage lie east of modern Tunis on the North African coast. A formal peace treaty was signed by Ugo Vetere and Chedli Klibi, the mayors of Rome and the modern city of Carthage, respectively, on 5 February 1985; 2,131 years after the war ended.

The Conch Republic is a micronation declared as a tongue-in-cheek secession of the city of Key West, Florida, from the United States on April 23, 1982. It has been maintained as a tourism booster for the city. Since then, the term \\"Conch Republic\\" has been expanded to refer to \\"all of the Florida Keys, or, that geographic apportionment of land that falls within the legally defined boundaries of Monroe County, Florida, northward to 'Skeeter's Last Chance Saloon' in Florida City, Dade County, Florida, with Key West as the nation's capital and all territories north of Key West being referred to as 'The Northern Territories'.A brief history of the Conch Republic While the protests that sparked the creation of the Conch Republic (and others since then) have been described by some as \\"tongue-in-cheek,\\" they were motivated by frustrations over genuine concerns. The original protest event was motivated by a U.S. Border Patrol roadblock and checkpoint that greatly inconvenienced residents and tourists. The Conch Republic celebrates Independence Day every April 23 as part of a week-long festival of activities involving numerous businesses in Key West. The organization ‚Äî a \\"Sovereign State of Mind\\", seeking only to bring more \\"Humor, Warmth and Respect\\" to a world in sore need of all three according to its late Secretary General, Peter Anderson ‚Äî is a key tourism booster for the area.Reno Gazette-Journal History In 1982, the United States Border Patrol set up a roadblock and inspection point on US 1 just north of the merger of Monroe County Road 905A/Miami-Dade County Road 905A onto US 1 (they are the only two roads connecting the Florida Keys with the mainland), in front of the Last Chance Saloon just south of Florida City. Vehicles were stopped and searched for narcotics and illegal immigrants. The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys' important tourism industry. Eastern Air Lines, which had a hub at Miami International Airport, saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only airline to establish jet service to Key West International Airport, counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles. When the City Council's complaints went unanswered by the U.S. federal government and attempts to get an injunction against the roadblock failed in court, as a form of protest Mayor Dennis Wardlow and the council declared Key West's independence on April 23, 1982. In the eyes of the council, since the U.S. federal government had set up the equivalent of a border station as if they were a foreign nation, they might as well become one. As many of the local citizens were referred to as Conchs, the nation took the name of the Conch Republic. As part of the protest, Mayor Wardlow was proclaimed Prime Minister of the Republic, which immediately declared war against the United States (symbolically breaking a loaf of stale Cuban bread over the head of a man dressed in a naval uniform), quickly surrendered after one minute (to the man in the uniform), and applied for one billion dollars in foreign aid. Conch Republic officials were invited to the Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994, and Conch representatives were officially invited to 1995's Florida Jubilee. The faux secession and the events surrounding it generated great publicity for the Keys' plight ‚Äî the roadblock and inspection station were removed soon afterward. It also resulted in the creation of a new avenue of tourism for the Keys. =Invasions of 1995= On September 20, 1995, it was reported that the 478th Civil Affairs Battalion of the United States Army Reserve was to conduct a training exercise simulating an invasion of a foreign island. They were to land on Key West and conduct affairs as if the islanders were foreign. However, no one from the 478th notified Conch officials of the exercise. Seeing another chance at publicity, Wardlow and the forces behind the 1982 Conch Republic secession mobilized the island for a full-scale war, sending the schooner Western Union out to attack an incoming Coast Guard Cutter with water balloons, conch fritters and stale Cuban bread, to which the Coast Guard responded with their fire hoses (quickly ending the battle), and protested to the Department of Defense for arranging this exercise without consulting the City of Key West. The leaders of the 478th issued an apology the next day, saying they \\"in no way meant to challenge or impugn the sovereignty of the Conch Republic\\", and submitted to a surrender ceremony on September 22. During the U.S. federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, as a protest, the Republic sent a flotilla of Conch Navy civilian and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson, located in Dry Tortugas National Park, to reopen it. The action was dubbed a \\"full scale invasion\\" by the Conch Republic. Inspired by efforts of the Smithsonian Institution to keep its museums open by private donations, local residents had raised private money to keep the park running (a closed park would damage the tourist-dependent local economy), but could find no one to accept the money and reopen the park.https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1995/12/30/key-west-to-conch-er-closed- federal-park/ When officials attempted to enter the monument, they were cited. When the citation was contested in court the following year, the resultant case, The United States of America v. Peter Anderson, was quickly dropped.https://web.archive.org/web/20150304095044/https://conchrepublic.com/fortjef.htm =The annexation of Seven Mile Bridge= Seven Mile Bridge In yet another protest on January 13, 2006, Peter Anderson (the defendant in the Dry Tortugas case from 1995‚Äì1996) purported to annex the abandoned span of Seven Mile Bridge, which had been replaced by a parallel span in 1982. The move was in response to a recent event regarding Cuban refugees. On the previous January 4, fifteen Cuban refugees reached the bridge, but were returned to Cuba by the U.S. Border Patrol because the U.S. government had declared the bridge a \\"wet feet\\" location under the wet feet, dry feet policy. The rationale was that, since two sections of the span had been removed and it was no longer connected to land, it was not part of U.S. territory subject to the \\"dry feet\\" rule, and thus the refugees could not stay. Anderson, seizing upon the U.S.'s apparent disavowal of the abandoned span, claimed it for the Republic. He expressed hope to use the bridge for affordable, ecologically friendly housing. In response, Russel Schweiss, spokesman for Florida governor Jeb Bush, declared \\"With all due respect to the Conch Republic, the bridge belongs to all the people of Florida, and we're not currently in negotiations to sell it.\\" The refugee decision was later overturned, but only after the refugees had been returned to Cuba. =Recent history= In another protest, beginning in 2008, the northern keys including Key Largo formed a separation of the Conch Republic known as the Independent Northernmost Territories of the Conch Republic. Proponents claim this separation is a result of disagreements over the definition and use of the term 'Conch Republic'. As of 2011, the Southernmost Point Buoy mentions the Conch Republic. Souvenir passports and vehicle registration A Conch Republic flag hanging from a balcony. Through their website, the Republic issues souvenir passports. These are issued as souvenirs, but some have evidently bought them in the mistaken belief they are legitimate travel and identity documents. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, FBI investigators thought that hijacker Mohamed Atta had possibly purchased a Conch Republic passport from the website. International vehicle registration code stickers can also be purchased from vendors in Key West, bearing the initials \\"KW\\" and \\"CR\\"‚Äîthe country codes for Kuwait and Costa Rica, respectively. Military The Conch Republic actively maintains an Army, Navy, and Air Force whose primary duties are to help re-enact the Great Sea Battle of 1982 and the retaking of Fort Jefferson. The Conch Republic Navy comprises no fewer than 10 civilian boats and the schooner Wolf under the command of Admiral Finbar Gittelman. The Army consists of the 1st Conch Artillery, garrisoned in Fort Taylor. The Conch Republic Air Force has more than a dozen appointed aircraft in its fleet. The flagship, a 1942 Waco, was flown by Fred R. Cabanas, a legendary stunt pilot and Ambassador for the Conch Republic at air shows worldwide. He flew \\"Conch Fury\\" in the 2005 Reno Air Races. Fred was declared General of the Air Force by the mayor of Key West after intercepting a defecting Cuban MiG-23 with his Pitts Special in 1991. Following his death in January 2013, Fred was succeeded by his son, Raymond Cabanas. In literature Some of the action in Joe Haldeman's 1989 science fiction novel Buying Time (published in UK as The Long Habit of Living) takes place in the Conch Republic, a lawless place where assassination and other activities are perfectly legal. Science fiction writer Spider Robinson's Callahan's Crosstime Saloon series - about an Irish bar full of time travellers, aliens and musicians - find themselves relocated to the Conch Republic in the 2000 novel Callahans Key. In popular culture Between 1994 and 1995, WCW wrestler Kevin Sullivan was billed and announced as someone who \\"now seeks sanctuary in the Conch Republic\\". National anthem In 1994, Joe and Meri-Lynn Britz wrote the National Anthem for the Conch Republic, Conch Republic. It was recorded by the Key Lime Pie band and voted on and accepted by the city of Key West City Commissioners. The song \\"Working in the Conch Republic\\" is a BMI tune and can be found on YouTube.youtube See also * Forgottonia, a secessionist movement in Illinois in the 1970s * The Mouse That Roared, a comedy in which a minuscule nation declares war on the United States and wins References External links * 'Conch Republic Independence Celebration' website * 'Conch Republic Military Forces' website Category:Culture of Key West, Florida Category:Geography of Florida Category:History of Key West, Florida Category:Micronations in the United States Category:Separatism in the United States Category:Secessionist towns and cities Category:States and territories established in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in Florida ","title":"Conch Republic"},{"id":"266654","text":"Fenghuang () are mythological birds found in Sinospheric mythology that reign over all other birds. It is known under similar names from various languages (Vietnamese: Ph∆∞·ª£ng ho√†ng or Ph·ª•ng ho√†ng; Japanese: H≈ç-≈ç or Hou-ou; Korean: Bonghwang). The males were originally called feng and the females huang but such a distinction of gender is often no longer made and they are blurred into a single feminine entity so that the bird can be paired with the Chinese dragon, which is traditionally deemed male. The fenghuang is also called the \\"August Rooster\\" () since it sometimes takes the place of the Rooster in the Chinese zodiac. In the Western world, it is commonly called the Chinese phoenix or simply Phoenix, although mythological similarities with the Western phoenix are superficial. Appearance Image of the fenghuang opposite the dragon on the Twelve Symbols national emblem, which was the state emblem of China from 1913-1928 A common depiction of fenghuang was of it attacking snakes with its talons and its wings spread. According to the Erya's chapter 17 Shiniao, fenghuang is made up of the beak of a rooster, the face of a swallow, the forehead of a fowl, the neck of a snake, the breast of a goose, the back of a tortoise, the hindquarters of a stag and the tail of a fish. Today, however, it is often described as a composite of many birds including the head of a golden pheasant, the body of a mandarin duck, the tail of a peacock, the legs of a crane, the mouth of a parrot, and the wings of a swallow. The fenghuang's body symbolizes the celestial bodies: the head is the sky, the eyes are the sun, the back is the moon, the wings are the wind, the feet are the earth, and the tail is the planets. The fenghuang is said to have originated in the sun. Its body contains the five fundamental colors: black, white, red, yellow, and green. It sometimes carries scrolls or a box with sacred books. It is sometimes depicted with a fireball. It is believed that the bird only appears in areas or places that are blessed with utmost peace and prosperity or happiness. Chinese tradition cites it as living atop the Kunlun Mountains in northern China. Origin A vase with a phoenix-headed spout, gray sandstone with celadon coating, Song Dynasty, last half of 10th century. Images of an ancient bird have appeared in China for over 8000 years, as earliest as the Hongshan neolithic period, on jade and pottery motifs, then appearing decorating bronze as well as jade figurines. Some believe they may have been a good-luck totem among eastern tribes of ancient China. During the Han dynasty (2,200 years ago) two phoenixes, one a male (feng, ) and the other a female (huang, ) were often shown together facing one other. Later, during the Yuan dynasty the two terms were merged to become fenghuang, but the \\"King of Birds\\" came to symbolize the empress when paired with a dragon representing the emperor. From the Jiajing era (1522‚Äì66) of the Ming dynasty onwards, a pair of phoenixes was differentiated by the tail feathers of the two birds, typically together forming a closed circle pattern‚Äîthe male identified by five long serrated tail feathers or \\"filaments\\" (five being an odd, masculine, or yang number) and the female by what sometimes appears to be one but is in fact usually two curling or tendrilled tail feathers (two being an even, feminine, or yin number). Also during this period, the fenghuang was used as a symbol representing the direction south. This was portrayed through a male and female facing each other. Their feathers were of the five fundamental colors: black, white, red, green, and yellow. These colors are said to represent Confucius' five virtues: #Ren: the virtue of benevolence, charity, and humanity; #Yi: honesty and uprightness; Y√¨ may be broken down into zh≈çng, doing one's best, conscientiousness, loyalty and sh√π: the virtue of reciprocity, altruism, consideration for others #Zhi: knowledge #Xin: faithfulness and integrity; #Li: correct behavior, propriety, good manners, politeness, ceremony, worship. The phoenix represented power sent from the heavens to the Empress. If a phoenix was used to decorate a house it symbolized that loyalty and honesty were in the people that lived there. Or alternatively, a phoenix only stays when the ruler is without darkness and corruption (). Meaning Longshan Temple in Taipei Dutch man, circa 1664. The fenghuang has very positive connotations. It is a symbol of high virtue and grace. The fenghuang also symbolizes the union of yin and yang. The first chapter of the Classic of Mountains and Seas , the \\"Nanshang-jing\\", records each part of fenghuang's body symbolizes a word. The head represents virtue (), the wing represents duty (), the back represents propriety (), the abdomen says credibility () and the chest represents mercy ().Shan Hai Jing - chapter 1. ‚ÄúNanshang Jing‚Äù - Nan Ci San Jing: Portrait of an empress, possibly Empress Xiaoxianchun, (wife of the Qianlong Emperor) sitting on a chair decorated with Phoenix In ancient and modern Chinese culture, they can often be found in the decorations for weddings or royalty, along with dragons. This is because the Chinese considered the dragon-and-phoenix design symbolic of blissful relations between husband and wife, another common yang and yin metaphor. In some traditions it appears in good times but hides during times of trouble, while in other traditions it appeared only to mark the beginning of a new era.Sources: * It's rumored to only land in areas where there is something precious underneath.

Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the town is a tourist destination and its visitor attractions include its spa waters and RHS Harlow Carr gardens. away from the town centre is the Yorkshire Dales national park and the Nidderdale AONB. Harrogate grew out of two smaller settlements, High Harrogate and Low Harrogate, in the 17th century. For three consecutive years (2013‚Äì2015), polls voted the town as \\"the happiest place to live\\" in Britain.\\"Harrogate named as happiest place to live in Britain\\", BBC, 6 August 2015 Harrogate spa water contains iron, sulphur and common salt. The town became known as 'The English Spa' in the Georgian era, after its waters were discovered in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries its 'chalybeate' waters (containing iron) were a popular health treatment, and the influx of wealthy but sickly visitors contributed significantly to the wealth of the town. Harrogate railway station and Harrogate bus station in the town centre provide transport connections. Leeds Bradford Airport is southwest of Harrogate. The main roads through the town are the A61, connecting Harrogate to Leeds and Ripon, and the A59, connecting the town to York and Skipton. Harrogate is also connected to Wetherby and the A1(M) by the A661, while the A658 from Bradford forms a bypass around the south of the town. Harrogate had a population of 71,594 at the 2001 UK census;Local statistics - Office for National Statistics Office for National Statistics : Neighbourhood Statistics] Retrieved 18 September 2009The population of the Harrogate Unparished Area is derived from the totals for Bilton; Granby; Harlow Moor; High Harrogate; Hookstone; Low Harrogate; New Park; Pannal; Rossett; Saltergate; Starbeck; Stray; and Woodfield wards then subtracting that part of Killinghall Civil Parish within Saltergate Ward. The population for the portion of Killinghall Civil Parish is derived from subtracting the populations of Nidd and Ripley Civil Parishes from the total for Killinghall ward. This gives the portion of Killinghall Civil Parish in Killinghall Ward; this is then subtracted from the total for Killinghall Civil Parish to give the total for the portion of Killinghall Civil Parish in Saltergate Ward. the urban area comprising Harrogate and nearby Knaresborough had a population of 85,128, while the figure for the much wider Borough of Harrogate, comprising Harrogate, Knaresborough, Ripon, as well as a number of smaller settlements and a large rural area, was 151,339. The town motto is Arx celebris fontibus, which means \\"a citadel famous for its springs.\\" Toponym The name Harrogate is first attested in the 1330s as Harwegate, Harougat and Harrowgate. The origin of the name is uncertain. It may derive from Old Norse h«´rgr 'a heap of stones, cairn' + gata 'street', in which case the name presumably meant 'road to the cairn'.Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. HARROGATE. Another possibility is that the name means \\"the way to Harlow\\". The form Harlowgate is known from 1518, and apparently in the court rolls of Edward II. History Royal Pump Room In medieval times Harrogate was a place on the borders of the township of Bilton with Harrogate in the ancient Parish of Knaresborough, and the parish of Pannal, also known as Beckwith with Rossett. The part within the township of Bilton developed into the community of High Harrogate, and the part within Pannal developed into the community of Low Harrogate. Both communities were within the Royal Forest of Knaresborough. In 1372 King Edward III granted the Royal Forest to his son John, Duke of Lancaster (also known as John of Gaunt), and the Duchy of Lancaster became the principal landowner in Harrogate. Harrogate's development is owed to the discovery of its chalybeate and sulphur rich spring water from the 16th century. The first mineral spring was discovered in 1571 by William Slingsby who found that water from the Tewit Well in High Harrogate possessed similar properties to that from springs in the Belgian town of Spa, which gave its name to spa towns. The medicinal properties of the waters were publicised by Edmund Deane; his book, Spadacrene Anglica, or the English Spa Fountain was published in 1626. In the 17th and 18th centuries further chalybeate springs were discovered in High Harrogate, and both chalybeate and sulphur springs were found in Low Harrogate. The two communities attracted many visitors. A number of inns were opened for visitors in High Harrogate in the 17th century (the Queen's Head, the Granby, the Dragon and the World's End). In Low Harrogate, the Crown was open by the mid 18th century, and possibly earlier. In accordance with an Enclosure Act of 1770, promoted by the Duchy of Lancaster, the Royal Forest of Knaresborough was enclosed. The enclosure award of 1778 clarified ownership of land in the Harrogate area. Under the award of land, which included the springs known at that time, were reserved as a public common, The Stray, which has remained public open space. The Enclosure Award facilitated development around the Stray. During the 19th century, the area between High Harrogate and Low Harrogate, which until then had remained separate communities a mile apart, was developed, and what is now the central area of Harrogate was built on high ground overlooking Low Harrogate. An area to the north of the developing town was reserved to the Duchy of Lancaster, and was developed for residential building. To provide entertainment for the increasing numbers of visitors the Georgian Theatre was built in 1788. Bath Hospital (later the Royal Bath Hospital) was built in 1826. The Royal Pump Room was built in 1842. The site of Tewit Well is marked by a dome on the Stray. Other wells can be found in the Valley Gardens and Royal Pump Room museum. In 1870, engineering inventor Samson Fox perfected the process of creating water gas, in the basement laboratory of Grove House. After constructing a trial plant at his home on Skipton Road, making it the first house in Yorkshire to have gas lighting and heating; he built a town-sized plant to supply Harrogate. After Parliament Street became the world's first route to be lit by water-gas, newspapers commented: \\"Samson Fox has captured the sunlight for Harrogate.\\" After donating the town's first fire engine, and building the town's theatre, he was elected mayor for three years, an unbroken record. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Harrogate was popular among the English √©lite and frequented by nobility from mainland Europe . Its popularity declined after the First World War. During the Second World War, Harrogate's large hotels accommodated government offices evacuated from London paving the way for the town to become a commercial, conference, and exhibition centre. In 1893 Harrogate doctor George Oliver was the first to observe the effect of adrenaline on the circulation. Former employers in the town were the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the Milk Marketing Board and ICI who occupied offices and laboratories at Hornbeam Park where Crimplene was invented in the 1950s and named after the nearby Crimple Valley and beck. In 2007, two metal detectorists found the Harrogate hoard, a 10th-century Viking treasure hoard, near Harrogate. The hoard contains almost 700 coins and other items from as far away as Afghanistan. The hoard was described by the British Museum as the most important find of its type in Britain for 150 years. Governance Harrogate Town Hall In 1884 the Municipal Borough of Harrogate was created, taking High Harrogate from the civil parish of Bilton with Harrogate and Low Harrogate from the civil parish of Pannal. The borough absorbed neighbouring areas in subsequent years, including the whole of the civil parishes of Bilton and Starbeck, and a large part of the civil parish of Pannal, including the village of Pannal, in 1938. The municipal borough was abolished in 1974, when Harrogate was transferred from the West Riding to North Yorkshire and became part of the wider Borough of Harrogate. Harrogate then became an unparished area, with no local government of its own. The MP for the Harrogate and Knaresborough constituency is Andrew Jones, a Conservative. He was elected in 2010, ousting the Liberal Democrats who had won the seat at the previous three general elections. He subsequently won re- election in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 (albeit with a reduced majority) general elections. The town is governed by Harrogate Borough Council, which since the 2010 election has had a Conservative majority. The Borough of Harrogate is twinned with: * Bagn√®res-de-Luchon, France (since 1953) * Barrie, Canada (since 2013) * Harrogate, Tennessee, United States * Montecatini Terme, Italy (since 1962) * Wellington, New Zealand Geography The town is a dormitory town for commuters working in Leeds, Bradford and York area.

The Stray is an area of open parkland in the centre of the town. It was created in 1778 to link most of Harrogate's springs in one protected area by an act of Parliament which fixed its area as , and even now when part is removed, e.g. due to road widening, it must be replaced elsewhere. During the Victorian period, there was a racecourse for horses there. RHS Harlow Carr gardens, on the western edge of Harrogate, are award- winning themed gardens and are the Royal Horticultural Society's main presence and representative in the North of England.

Today much of the route of the line through the city is now a relief road and although the former station still stands, it is now surrounded by a new housing development. The issue remains a significant one in local politics and there are movements wanting to restore the line. Reports suggest the reopening of a line between Ripon and Harrogate would be economically viable, costing ¬£40 million and could initially attract 1,200 passengers a day, rising to 2,700. Campaigners call on MPs to restore Ripon railway link. =Buses= Yorkshire Tiger Flying Tiger route 747 now withdrawn Operator Website has Bradford/Airport/harrogate service removed - https://www.yorkshiretiger.co.uk/timetables/ Buses are every 15 minutes between Harrogate, Ripon and Leeds (via Harewood, Moortown and Chapel Allerton) on route 36, which run more frequently at peak time and overnight on Fridays and Saturdays between Leeds and Harrogate.

The Qur ªan was originally written in the Arabic language and has been translated into most major African, Asian and European languages.  Islamic theology  The translation of the Qur ªan into modern languages has always been a difficult issue in Islamic theology. Because Muslims revere the Qur ªan as miraculous and inimitable (i ªjaz al- Qur ªan), they argue that the Qur ªanic text should not be isolated from its true form to another language or written form, at least not without keeping the Arabic text with it. Furthermore, an Arabic word, like a Hebrew or Aramaic word, may have a range of meanings depending on the context ‚Äì a feature present in all Semitic languages, when compared to English, Latin, and Romance languages ‚Äì making an accurate translation even more difficult. According to Islamic theology, the Qur ªan is a revelation very specifically in Arabic, and so it should only be recited in Quranic Arabic. Translations into other languages are necessarily the work of humans and so, according to Muslims, no longer possess the uniquely sacred character of the Arabic original. Since these translations necessarily subtly change the meaning, they are often called \\"interpretations\\" or \\"translation[s] of the meanings\\" (with \\"meanings\\" being ambiguous between the meanings of the various passages and the multiple possible meanings with which each word taken in isolation can be associated, and with the latter connotation amounting to an acknowledgement that the so- called translation is but one possible interpretation and is not claimed to be the full equivalent of the original). For instance, Pickthall called his translation The Meaning of the Glorious Koran rather than simply The Koran. The task of translation of the Qur ªan is not an easy one; some native Arab speakers will confirm that some Qur ªanic passages are difficult to understand even in the original Arabic script. A part of this is the innate difficulty of any translation; in Arabic, as in other languages, a single word can have a variety of meanings. There is always an element of human judgement involved in understanding and translating a text. This factor is made more complex by the fact that the usage of words has changed a great deal between classical and modern Arabic. As a result, even Qur ªanic verses which seem perfectly clear to native Arab speakers accustomed to modern vocabulary and usage may not represent the original meaning of the verse. The original meaning of a Qur ªanic passage will also be dependent on the historical circumstances of the prophet Muhammad's life and early community in which it originated. Investigating that context usually requires a detailed knowledge of hadith and sirah, which are themselves vast and complex texts. This introduces an additional element of uncertainty which cannot be eliminated by any linguistic rules of translation.  History  The first translation of the Qur ªan was performed by Salman the Persian, who translated surah al-Fatiha into the Middle Persian in the early seventh century.An-Nawawi, Al-Majmu', (Cairo, Matbacat at-'Tadamun n.d.), 380. According to Islamic tradition contained in the hadith, the Negus of the Ethiopian Empire and the Byzantine emperor Heraclius received letters from Muhammad containing verses from the Qur ªan. However, during Muhammad's lifetime, no passage from the Qur ªan was ever translated into these languages nor any other. The second known translation was into Greek and was used by Nicetas Byzantius, a scholar from Constantinople, in his 'Refutation of Qur ªan' written between 855 and 870. However, we know nothing about who and for what purpose had made this translation. It is however very probable that it was a complete translation.Christian H√∏gel, \\"An early anonymous Greek translation of the Qur ªan. The fragments from Niketas Byzantios' Refutatio and the anonymous Abjuratio\\", Collectanea Christiana Orientalia 7 (2010), pp. 65‚Äì119; Kees Versteegh, \\"Greek translations of the Qur ªan in Christian polemics (9th century)\\", Zeitschrift der Deutschen morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft 141 (1991); Ast√©rios Argyriou, \\"Perception de l'Islam et traductions du Coran dans le monde byzantin grec\\", Byzantion 75 (2005). The first fully attested complete translations of the Qur ªan were done between the 10th and 12th centuries into Classical Persian. The Samanid emperor, Mansur I (961‚Äì976), ordered a group of scholars from Khorasan to translate the Tafsir al-Tabari, originally in Arabic, into Persian. Later in the 11th century, one of the students of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari wrote a complete tafsir of the Qur ªan in Persian. In the 12th century, Najm al-Din 'Umar al-Nasafi translated the Qur ªan into Persian. The manuscripts of all three books have survived and have been published several times. In 1936, translations in 102 languages were known. = European languages =  Latin  Bertrandon de la Broqui√®re giving a Latin translation of the Qur ªan to Philip the Bold (detail). Illustration (folio 152v) by from BnF, MS fr. 9087, made in Lille in 1455. Robertus Ketenensis produced the first Latin translation of the Qur ªan in 1143. His version was entitled Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete (\\"The law of Mahomet the false prophet\\"). The translation was made at the behest of Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, and currently exists in the Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal in Paris. According to modern scholars, the translation tended to \\"exaggerate harmless text to give it a nasty or licentious sting\\" and preferred improbable and unpleasant meanings over likely and decent ones. Ketenensis' work was republished in 1543 in three editions by Theodore Bibliander at Basel along with Cluni corpus and other Christian propaganda. All editions contained a preface by Martin Luther. Many later European \\"translations\\" of the Qur ªan merely translated Ketenensis' Latin version into their own language, as opposed to translating the Qur ªan directly from Arabic. As a result, early European translations of the Qur ªan were erroneous and distorted. In the early thirteenth century, Mark of Toledo made another, more literal, translation into Latin, which survives in a number of manuscripts. In the fifteenth century, Juan of Segovia produced another translation in collaboration with the Mudejar writer, Isa of Segovia. Only the prologue survives. In the sixteenth century, Juan Gabriel Terrolensis aided Cardenal Eguida da Viterbo in another translation into Latin. In the early seventeenth century, another translated was made, attributed to Cyril Lucaris. Louis Maracci (1612‚Äì1700), a teacher of Arabic at the Sapienza University of Rome and confessor to Pope Innocent XI, issued a second Latin translation in 1698 in Padua.Samuel Marinus Zwemer: Translations of the Koran , The Moslem World, 1915 His edition contains the Qur ªan's Arabic text with a Latin translation, annotations to further understanding and ‚Äì embued by the time's spirit of controversy ‚Äì an essay titled \\"Refutation of the Qur ªan\\", where Marracci disproves Islam from the then Catholic point of view. Despite the refutatio's anti-Islamic tendency Marracci's translation is accurate and suitably commented; besides, by quoting many Islamic sources he certainly broadens his time's horizon considerably. Marracci's translation too became the source of other European translations (one in France by Savory, and one in German by Nerreter). These later translations were quite inauthentic, and one even claimed to be published in Mecca in 1165 AH.  Modern languages  The first translation in a modern European language was in Castilian Spanish or Aragonese by the convert Juan Andr√©s (or so he claims in his Confusi√≥n o Confutaci√≥n de la secta mahom√©tica y del alcor√°n) but this translation is lost. A few dozen Qur ªan verses into Castilian are found within the Confusi√≥n itself. There were lost translations in Catalan, one of them by Francesc Pons Saclota in 1382, the other appeared in Perpignan in 1384. Another Romance translation was made into Italian, 1547 by Andrea Arrivabene, derived from Ketenensis'. The Italian translation was used to derive the first German translation Salomon Schweigger in 1616 in Nuremberg, which in turn was used to derive the first Dutch translation in 1641. The first French translation came out in 1647, and again in 1775, issued by Andr√© du Ryer. The Du Ryer translation also fathered many re-translations, most notably an English version by Alexander Ross in 1649. Ross' version was used to derive several others: a Dutch version by Glazemaker, a German version by Lange.  French Language  L'Alcoran de Mahomet by Andr√© du Ryer, 1647. L'Alcoran de Mahomet / translat√© d'Arabe Fran√ßois par le Sieur Du Ryer, Sieur de la Garde Malezair., 1647, 1649, 1672, 1683, 1719, 1734, 1770, 1775, by Andr√© Du Ryer, was the first French translation. This was followed two centuries later in Paris by the 1840 translation by Kasimirski who was an interpreter for the French Persian legation. Then in the mid-twentieth century a new translation was done by R√©gis Blach√®re a French Orientalist followed few years later in 1959 by the first translation by a Muslim into the French Language from the original Arabic . This work of Muhammad Hamidullah continues to be reprinted and published in Paris and Lebanon as it is regarded as the most linguistically accurate of all translation although critics may complain there is some loss of the spirit of the Arabic original.  Spanish  There are four complete translations of the Qur ªan in modern Spanish that are commonly available. * Julio Cortes translation 'El Coran' is widely available in North America, being published by New York-based Tahrike Tarsile Qur ªan publishing house. * Ahmed Abboud and Rafael Castellanos, two converts to Islam of Argentine origin, published 'El Sagrado Coran' (El Nilo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1953). * Kamel Mustafa Hallak fine deluxe hardback print 'El Coran Sagrado' is printed by Maryland-based Amana Publications. * Abdel Ghani Melara Navio a Spaniard who converted to Islam in 1979, his 'Traduccion-Comentario Del Noble Coran' was originally published by Darussalam Publications, Riyadh, in December 1997. The King Fahd Printing Complex has their own version of this translation, with editing by Omar Kaddoura and Isa Amer Quevedo.  English  An engraving of Muhammad in The Life of Mahomet, containing an English translation of the Qur ªan derived from the French translation L'Alcoran de Mahomet, initially published in 1649. Edition dating to 1719. The earliest known translation of the Qur ªan in any European language was the Latin works by Robert of Ketton at the behest of the Abbot of Cluny in c. 1143. This translation remained the only one until 1649 when the first English language translation was done by Alexander Ross, chaplain to King Charles I, who translated from a French work L'Alcoran de Mahomet by du Ryer. In 1734, George Sale produced the first translation of the Qur ªan direct from Arabic into English but reflecting his missionary stance. Since then, there have been English translations by the clergyman John Medows Rodwell in 1861, and Edward Henry Palmer in 1880, both showing in their works a number of mistakes of mistranslation and misinterpretation, which brings into question their primary aim. These were followed by Richard Bell in 1937 and Arthur John Arberry in the 1950s. The Qur ªan (1910) by Dr. Mirza Abul Fazl (1865‚Äì1956), a native of East Bengal (now Bangladesh), later moved to Allahabad, India. He was the first Muslim to present a translation of the Qur ªan into English along with the original Arabic text. Among the contemporary Muslim scholars, Dr. Abul Fazl was a pioneer who took interest in the study of the chronological order of the Qur ªan and drew the attention of Muslim scholars to its importance. With the increasing population of English-speaking Muslims around the start of the 20th century, three Muslim translations of the Qur ªan into English made their first appearance. The first was Muhammad Ali's 1917 translation, which is composed from an Ahmadiyya perspective, with some small parts being rejected as unorthodox interpretation by vast majority of Muslims. This was followed in 1930 by the English convert to Islam Marmaduke Pickthall's more literalist translation. Soon thereafter in 1934, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, a Bohra Ismaili, published his translation, featuring copious explanatory annotation ‚Äì over 6000 notes, generally being around 95% of the text on a given page, to supplement the main text of the translation. This translation has gone through over 30 printings by several different publishing houses, and is one of the most popular amongst English-speaking Muslims, alongside the Pickthall and Saudi-sponsored Hilali-Khan translations. With few new English translations over the 1950‚Äì1980 period, these three Muslim translations were to flourish and cement reputations that were to ensure their survival into the 21st century, finding favour among readers often in newly revised updated editions. Orientalist Arthur Arberry's 1955 translation and native Iraqi Jew N. J. Dawood's unorthodox translation in 1956 were to be the only major works to appear in the post-war period. A. J. Arberry's The Koran Interpreted remains the scholarly standard for English translations, and is widely used by academics. The English translation of Kanzul Iman is called The Treasure of Faith, which is translated by Farid Ul Haq. It is in simple, easy-to- understand modern-day English. Explanations are given in brackets to avoid ambiguity, provide better understanding and references to similar verses elsewhere. Dr. Syed Abdul Latif's translation published in 1967, regarded highly by some. He was a professor of English at Osmania University, Hyderabad. It was nevertheless short-lived due to criticism of his foregoing accuracy for the price of fluency. The Message of the Qur ªan: Presented in Perspective (1974) was published by Hashim Amir Ali. He translated the Qur ªan into English and arranged it according to chronological order. Dr. Hashim Amir-Ali (1903-c. 1987) was a native of Salar Jung, Hyderabad State in the Deccan Plateau. In 1938, he came under the influence of Dr. Abul Fazl and took a deep interest in the study of the Qur ªan and was aware of the significance of the chronological order of the passages contained in it. Another Jewish convert to Islam, Muhammad Asad's monumental work The Message of The Qur'an made its appearance for the first time in 1980. Professor Ahmed Ali's Al- Qur ªan: A Contemporary Translation (Akrash Publishing, Karachi, 1984, Reprinted by Oxford University Press, Delhi, 1987; Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 1988, with 9th reprinting 2001). Fazlur Rahman Malik of the University of Chicago writes, \\"It brings out the original rhythms of the Qur ªanic language and the cadences. It also departs from traditional translations in that it gives more refined and differentiated shades of important concepts\\". According to Francis Edward Peters of New York University, \\"Ahmed Ali's work is clear, direct, and elegant ‚Äì a combination of stylistic virtues almost never found in translations of the Qur ªan. His is the best I have read\\". At the cusp of the 1980s, the 1973 oil crisis, the Iranian Revolution, the Nation of Islam and a new wave of cold-war generated Muslim immigrants to Europe and North America brought Islam squarely into the public limelight for the first time in Western Europe and North America. This resulted in a wave of translations as Western publishers tried to capitalize on the new demand for English translations of the Qur ªan. Oxford University Press and Penguin Books were all to release editions at this time, as did indeed the Saudi Government, which came out with its own re-tooled version of the original Yusuf Ali translation. Canadian Muslim Professor T. B. Irving's 'modern English' translation (1985) was a major Muslim effort during that time. Qur ªan: The Final Testament, Islamic Productions, Tucson, Arizona, (1989) was published by Rashad Khalifa (; 19 November 1935 ‚Äì 31 January 1990) Khalifa wrote that he was a messenger of God and that the archangel Gabriel 'most assertively' told him that chapter 36, verse 3, of the Qur ªan, 'specifically' referred to him.Appendix ii, (21), Authorized English Translation of the Qur ªan, Dr. Rashad Khalifa, PhD He is referred to as God's Messenger of the Covenant by his followers. He wrote that the Qur ªan contains a mathematical structure based on the number 19. He made the controversial claim that the last two verses of chapter nine in the Qur ªan were not canonical, telling his followers to reject them.‚Ä≥The idol worshipers were destined to tamper with the Qur ªan by adding 2 false verses (9:128‚Äì129).‚Ä≥ His reasoning was that the verses, disrupted an otherwise flawless nineteen-based pattern and were sacrilegious inasmuch as they appeared to endorse worship of Muhammad. Khalifa's research received little attention in the West. In 1980, Martin Gardner mentioned it in Scientific American.Gardner, Martin (1980), Mathematical Games, Scientific American, September 1980, pp16‚Äì20. Gardner later wrote a more extensive and critical review of Khalifa and his work.The numerology of Dr. Rashad Khalifa ‚Äì scientist, Martin Gardner, Skeptical Inquirer, Sept‚ÄìOct 1997 The arrival of the 1990s ushered in the phenomenon of an extensive English-speaking Muslim population well-settled in Western Europe and North America.

Biography  The youngest son of Captain James Haldane of Airthrey Castle (who died two weeks before he was born),Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 (his older brother Robert Haldane was also a clergyman) in Stirlingshire, he was born at Dundee. His mother was sister to Admiral Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan.Grants Old and New Edinburgh, chapter 16 He was educated first at Dundee Grammar School and afterwards at the High School in Edinburgh and University of Edinburgh. At the age of seventeen he joined the Honorable East India Company as a midshipman on board the ship, the Duke of Montrose. After four voyages to India, in the summer of 1793, he was promoted to captain and commander of the Melville Castle. He started a careful study of the Bible during his voyages, and also came under the evangelical influence of David Bogue of Gosport, one of the founders of the London Missionary Society. He briefly returned to Scotland in 1793, and began preaching on an itinerant basis. He remained in HEICS until 1797, his final action being on home ground in the Spithead mutiny, where he boarded the \\"Dutton\\".Grants Old and New Edinburgh vol V p.158 He left the HEICS in the summer of 1797 and, encouraged by friends, began as a lay preacher in Gilmerton south of Edinburgh. = Evangelism = In about 1796 he became acquainted with the celebrated evangelical, Charles Simeon of Cambridge, in whose company he toured Scotland, distributing tracts and trying to awaken others to an interest in religious subjects. In May 1797 he preached his first sermon, at Gilmerton near Edinburgh, with encouraging success. In the same year he established a non-sectarian organization for tract distribution and lay preaching called the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at Home. During the next few years he made repeated missionary journeys, preaching wherever he could obtain hearers, and generally in the open air. Around 1815 he moved to the city centre, living at 16 George StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1815 and began preaching at the huge Tabernacle Church at the head of Leith Walk (now the site of the Playhouse Theatre).Grants Old and New Edinburgh Haldane was never a preacher for the Church of Scotland, but was an evangelical preacher, who proved more popular than the established church. His studies of the New Testament led him to leave that denomination behind and work in an independent church movement. Along with his brother, Robert Haldane, and others, James established 85 independent churches in Scotland and Ireland. Churches originated by the Haldanes practised baptism by immersion, weekly communion, and congregational polity (autonomous government). The Haldanes also operated a seminary and were influenced in their principles by other independency thinkers such as John Glas and Robert Sandeman of the Glasite church. As advancing years compelled him to withdraw from the more exhausting labours of travel and open-air preaching, he sought to influence the discussion of current religious and theological questions by means of the press. In later years he adopted Baptist views.

Biography He was born at Reading, Berkshire in 1759 and baptised in the parish church on 24 October of that year. He was the fourth and youngest son of Richard Simeon (died 1784) and Elizabeth Hutton. His eldest brother, named Richard after their father, died early. His second brother, John, entered the legal profession, became an MP and received a baronetcy. The third brother, Edward Simeon, was a director of the Bank of England. Simeon was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate at King's from 1779, brought up in the High Church tradition, he read The Whole Duty of Man and then a work by Thomas Wilson on the sacrament, and taking communion at Easter experienced a Christian conversion. In 1782 he became Fellow of King's College, and was ordained deacon, then graduating B.A. in 1783. He began as a minister as deputy to Christopher Atkinson (1754‚Äì1795), at St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge. Atkinson introduced him to John Venn and Simeon then met Henry Venn, confirming evangelical and Calvinist views. Simeon received the living of Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, in 1783. The appointment, technically a curacy, followed the death of the Rev. Henry Therond. Simeon's father intervened with James Yorke, the Bishop of Ely, and he was appointed, under the age of 23, as a curate-in-charge for the bishop. He was at first unpopular, and indeed the congregation would have preferred John Hammond (died 1830), who had been curate there, and became lecturer. Services were disrupted, and he was insulted in the streets. Simeon remained there for the rest of his life, eventually with a crowded church. Simeon died, unmarried, on 13 November 1836, and was buried on the 19th in King's College Chapel, Cambridge. His memorial by Humphrey Hopper in Holy Trinity Church (Cambridge), was described by architectural critic Nikolaus Pevsner as an \\"epitaph in Gothic forms.\\"Nikolaus Pevsner. Cambridgeshire. \\"The Buildings of England.\\" Second Edition (London: Penguin Books, 1970), p.231. Influence Simeon's funeral at King's College, Cambridge on 19 November 1836 Simeon gained influence among the undergraduates of the university. He became a leader among evangelical churchmen, and was one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society in 1799. He also helped found the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews (now known as the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People or CMJ) in 1809, and acted as adviser to the British East India Company in the choice of chaplains for India. According to the historian Thomas Macaulay, Simeon's \\"authority and influence‚Ä¶ extended from Cambridge to the most remote corners of England, ‚Ä¶ his real sway in the Church was far greater than that of any primate.\\" The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay, 1980, p. 50 Works In 1792 Simeon read An Essay on the Composition of a Sermon by the French Reformed minister Jean Claude. Simeon found that their principles were identical and used the essay as the basis for his lectures on sermon composition. Claude‚Äôs essay also inspired Simeon to make clear his own theological position. He published hundreds of sermons and sermon outlines (called \\"sermon skeletons\\"), still in print, that to some were an invitation to clerical plagiarism. His chief work is a commentary on the whole Bible, entitled Horae homileticae (London). Legacy Simeon is remembered in the Episcopal Church of the United States with a Lesser Feast and in the Anglican Church of Canada with a Commemoration on 13 November. In the Church of England he is remembered with a Lesser Festival on 13 November. He established what is now the Charles Simeon Trust, for the purpose of acquiring church patronage to perpetuate evangelical clergy in Church of England parishes. It arose from the bequest of John Thornton, who died in 1813, of ten advowsons, left to a trust, of which Simeon was one of the trustees. Simeon expanded the group of livings with money he had inherited. It continues to operate to this day.

It occupies a campus located in southeastern South Dakota, approximately southwest of Sioux Falls, northwest of Sioux City, Iowa, and north of the Missouri River. The university is home to South Dakota's only medical school and law school. It is also home to the National Music Museum, with over 15,000 American, European, and non-Western instruments. USD is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents, and its president is Sheila Gestring. The university has been accredited by the North Central Association of College and Schools since 1913.

History The University of South Dakota was founded in 1862 by the Dakota Territorial Legislature. It authorized the establishment of the University at Vermillion, making it the oldest postsecondary institution in the Dakotas. The authorization was unfunded, however, and classes did not begin until 20 years later under the auspices of the privately incorporated University of Dakota, created with support from the citizens of Clay County. Ephraim Epstein served as the first president and primary faculty member in the institution that opened in loaned space in downtown Vermillion. Before 1883 ended, the university had moved into Old Main, and the first public board was appointed to govern the institution. Enrollment increased to 69 students by the end of 1883, and, by the time South Dakota became the 40th state in 1889, USD boasted an enrollment of 500 students. USD's first academic unit, the College of Arts and Sciences, was established in 1883. The School of Law began offering classes in 1901; the School of Medicine in 1907; Continuing Education in 1916; the Graduate School in 1927; and the College of Fine Arts in 1931. The School of Business began offering classes in 1927 and has been continuously accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) since 1949. It is the state's oldest public university, and is one of six universities governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents. USD has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools since 1913 and is a member of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. The school houses the state's only law and medical schools and the lone College of Fine Arts. USD is also home to the state's oldest and largest political science department. Within the program is the Farber Fund, named for storied university professor emeritus Dr. William O. Farber, which provides subsidy to political science and criminal justice majors to attend conferences, participate in study tours, complete internships, and study abroad. The Sanford School of Medicine, a community- based program, emphasizes family medicine and primary care with the support and participation by practicing physicians and community hospitals throughout the state. Community hospitals and clinics provide teaching sites and the practicing physicians are teachers. The Lee Medical Sciences building houses the basic science education. Campus The University of South Dakota is based on a campus along the bluffs near the Missouri River in the southeast corner of the state. The most prominent academic facility on campus, one the school's symbols, is Old Main. It was built in 1883, burned down in 1893, and was fully restored in 1997. Along with several classrooms, it houses an Oscar Howe Museum, the University Honors Program. Farber Hall, a 190-seat theater used mainly for speaking engagements, is also in Old Main. =Campus and academic buildings= Al Neuharth Media Center, dedicated to Al Neuharth USD opened the newly constructed Theodore R. and Karen K. Muenster University Center (MUC) for student use on February 17, 2009. The MUC houses the Student Activities Center, a campus dining facility, coffee shop, bookstore, convenience store and a number of lounge and TV areas. It was expanded on January 13, 2014, to include more food and entertainment options. One of the newest additions to the campus is the Al Neuharth Media Center, named for the founder of USA Today. Dedicated in September 2003, the Neuharth Center houses the news and media organizations on campus, including the Freedom Forum‚Äôs South Dakota operations, South Dakota Public Broadcasting, the Department of Contemporary Media and Journalism, the campus newspaper The Volante, campus radio station KAOR, and television station KYOT. Formerly an armory and athletic field house, the building was converted into a media center through donations made by Al Neuharth, a 1950 USD graduate. USD's Beacom School of Business moved into a new building in the fall of 2009. The previous building, Patterson Hall, is used as office space.  Galleries  The University of South Dakota has two main galleries: The John A. Day Gallery located in the Fine Arts building and the Oscar Howe Gallery located in Old Main. There are several other locations across campus that are designated gallery space, such as the hall way on the second floor of the Muenster University Center.Student Wellness Center =Wellness Center & Dakota Dome= A $15 million, wellness center opened in the spring of 2011. Located just north of the Warren M. Lee Center for the Fine Arts, the center includes state-of-the-art workout equipment, a multi-story climbing wall, multiple courts for basketball and volleyball, racquetball courts, and a three-lane walking/jogging track. The DakotaDome serves not only as the home venue for the school's football, softball, swimming, basketball, volleyball, and track and field teams, but also as a recreational center for the student body. It is South Dakota's only domed football stadium, hosting the state's high school football championships in November. =Housing= Coyote Village Residence Hall North Complex consists of four residence halls: Beede, Mickelson, Richardson and Olson. Richardson is the only non-freshmen hall in North Complex. Coed-floors in the North Complex house men and women on the same floor on opposite sides with lounges, laundry and restrooms as a visual barrier. North Complex residence halls Olson (left) and Mickelson (right) Burgess/Norton Complex are located just south of North Complex. Burgess and Norton Halls are near Dakota, Noteboom, East Hall, Delzell Education Center, and the Arts and Sciences Building. They consist of 3 floors each with single-sex floors and typically house sophomores. Other residence halls include McFadden Hall, Coyote Village, and Brookman. McFadden Hall is for non-freshmen, graduate, professional and non-traditional students, outfitted with 25 four-person apartments and furnished individual single bedrooms. Brookman hall is single rooms for upperclassmen, international students and graduate students. Coyote Village, the university's newest residence complex, opened in 2010. Located just south of the DakotaDome, the four-story, 175-unit complex provides suite-style and apartment living for 548 students. Monthly rental rates for Coyote Village range from $453 to $658. All units are fully furnished and have wireless Internet. Coyote Village housing is available to all students. All full scholarship athletes live in Coyote Village. , Coyote Village.

Coyote News In fall 2005, USD's Contemporary Media & Journalism Department revived its weekly live 30-minute television newscast, Coyote News. It is entirely produced, directed & reported by USD students. The newscast airs Wednesdays at 5:00 PM with an encore broadcast at 6:00 PM on KYOT-TV, Cable Channel 21. The newscast can be viewed throughout Vermillion as well as numerous other cities in southeast South Dakota. The program was originally entitled \\"Coyote News\\" but was renamed in 2007, following the University of South Dakota's adoption of the U. marketing theme. In 2011, it was changed back to \\"Coyote News.\\" Also in 2007, U. News Radio newscasts began airing Wednesdays at noon on KAOR-FM, 91.1 U. Radio. The 15 minute live radio newscast is entirely produced and reported by USD students. The individual stories and features of U. News Radio and TV can be viewed online on the U. The KYOT-TV and KAOR-FM studios are located in the Al Neuharth Media Center on USD's campus. Coyote Radio In 2011 KAOR FM was renamed Coyote Radio, following the University of South Dakota's decision to end the U. Campaign. The central on-campus headquarters for KAOR Radio is the Al Neuharth Media Center while the transmitter lies atop Slagle Hall on USD's campus. The Volante The Volante (Spanish for \\"steering wheel\\") has served as the campus newspaper since 1887. It is published every Wednesday morning during the school year. Managed entirely by students, The Volante prides itself on its editorial independence. The paper has won numerous awards, including a number of Best of Show and Pacemakers. In October 2011 it was awarded its 8th Pacemaker Award, sometimes called the Pulitzer Prize of college journalism, by the Associated Collegiate Press. The paper includes news, sports, opinion and verve (arts and entertainment) sections. The paper also has a frequently updated website, which includes campus news, staff blogs and podcasts. The Volante generally maintains a staff of 50 students. =Department media= The Vermillion Literary Project Magazine is a literary journal published by the English Department of the University of South Dakota. The VLP Magazine is staffed by undergraduate and graduate students in the school and advised by faculty. Submissions are received from around the world and evaluated via a blind review. The award-winning publication is annual and in 2012 will celebrate its 30th year of press. =South Dakota Public Broadcasting= The university is home to South Dakota Public Broadcasting, or SDPB for short. It is a network of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television and NPR radio stations serving the state of South Dakota. The stations are operated by the South Dakota Bureau of Information and Telecommunication, a state agency. The studios and offices are located at 500 N. Dakota Avenue in the Al Neuharth Media Center on the west edge of campus. Recognition The Department of Political Science holds a number of popular speaker forums. The department has produced thirteen Truman Scholars, as well as four Rhodes Scholars. William O. Farber storied professor of Political Science is attributed with growing in developing the program. Upon his death 'Doc' Farber gifted the University with his house and other assets were established as the Farber Internship and Travel Fund, which funds students of Political Science for experiential learning opportunities. Athletics DakotaDome, home of USD football and other athletics The University of South Dakota sponsors six sports for men (football, basketball, swimming & diving, cross country, track & field and golf) and nine sports for women (basketball, swimming & diving, cross country, track & field, golf, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball). The school's athletic teams are called the \\"Coyotes\\" (pronounced Ki Yoat) and nicknamed the \\"Yotes\\" (Yoats). The school colors are red and white. USD competes at the NCAA Division I level (Football Championship Subdivision in football) and is a member of The Summit League for all sports except football. Its football team is a member of the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Athletic facilities include the DakotaDome, for football and indoor track, the Sanford Coyote Sports Center for volleyball and men's and women's basketball, First Bank & Trust Soccer Complex and Lillibridge Track Complex. The long-time intrastate rivalry between the Coyotes and South Dakota State Jackrabbits ended in 2003 when SDSU moved to Division I athletics and the Coyotes remained in Division II. USD eventually moved up to Division I and in the 2011‚Äì2012 academic year, SDSU and USD resumed regularly scheduled contests in most sports when the Coyotes joined the athletics conferences in which SDSU was a member, the Summit League and the Missouri Valley Football Conference. The University of South Dakota fight songs include South Dakota Victory, Hail South Dakota and Get Along Coyotes. The University of South Dakota's mascot of Coyotes comes from a horse race in 1863 in which a Dakota horse outran a horse from Iowa, in which someone from Iowa stated, \\"look at the Kiote run.\\"http://www.thesummitleague.org/sports/articles/2011-12/releases/usd_mascot Notable alumni and faculty Among the thousands of graduates from the University of South Dakota, notable alumni in the field of journalism include Al Neuharth, founder of the USA Today B.A., 1946; Greg Mortenson, author of Three Cups of Tea and Stones into Schools B.A., 1983; Tom Brokaw, American broadcaster and longtime NBC Nightly News anchor B.A., 1964.

In simple words, has-a relationship in an object is called a member field of an object. Multiple has-a relationships will combine to form a possessive hierarchy. This is to be contrasted with an is-a (is_a or is a) relationship which constitutes a taxonomic hierarchy (subtyping). The decision whether the most logical relationship for an object and its subordinate is not always clearly has-a or is-a. Confusion over such decisions have necessitated the creation of these metalinguistic terms. A good example of the has-a relationship is containers in the C++ STL. To summarize the relations, we have * hypernym-hyponym (supertype-subtype) relations between types (classes) defining a taxonomic hierarchy, where ** for an inheritance relation: a hyponym (subtype, subclass) has a type-of (is-a) relationship with its hypernym (supertype, superclass); * holonym-meronym (whole/entity/container- part/constituent/member) relations between types (classes) defining a possessive hierarchy, where ** for an aggregation (i.e. without ownership) relation: *** a holonym (whole) has a has-a relationship with its meronym (part), ** for a composition (i.e. with ownership) relation: *** a meronym (constituent) has a part-of relationship with its holonym (entity), ** for a containmentSee also Containment (computer programming). relation: *** a meronym (member) has a member-of relationship with its holonym (container); * concept-object (type-token) relations between types (classes) and objects (instances), where ** a token (object) has an instance-of relationship with its type (class). Examples = Entity‚Äìrelationship model = Entity‚Äìrelationship model In databases has-a relationships are usually represented in an Entity‚Äìrelationship model. As you can see by the diagram on the right an account can have multiple characters. This shows that account has a \\"has-a\\" relationship with character. = UML class diagram = UML class diagram Misuses of composition and aggregation In object-oriented programming this relationship can be represented with a Unified Modeling Language Class diagram. This has-a relationship is also known as composition. As you can see from the Class Diagram on the right a car \\"has-a\\" carburetor, or a car is \\"composed of\\" a carburetor. When the diamond is coloured black it signifies composition, i.e. the object on the side closest to the diamond is made up of or contains the other object. While the white diamond signifies aggregation, which means that the object closest to the diamond can have or possess the other object. = C++ = Another way to distinguish between composition and aggregation in modeling the real world, is to consider the relative lifetime of the contained object. For example, if a Car object contains a Chassis object, a Chassis will most likely not be replaced during the lifetime of the Car. It will have the same lifetime as the car itself; so the relationship is one of composition. On the other hand, if the Car object contains a set of Tire objects, these Tire objects may wear out and get replaced several times. Or if the Car becomes unusable, some Tires may be salvaged and assigned to another Car. At any rate, the Tire objects have different lifetimes than the Car object; therefore the relationship is one of aggregation. If one were to make a C++ software Class to implement the relationships described above, the Car object would contain a complete Chassis object in a data member. This Chassis object would be instantiated in the constructor of the Car class (or defined as the data type of the data member and its properties assigned in the constructor.) And since it would be a wholly contained data member of the Car class, the Chassis object would no longer exist if a Car class object was to be deleted. On the other hand, the Car class data members that point to Tire objects would most likely be C++ pointers. Tire objects could be instantiated and deleted externally, or even assigned to data members of a different Car object. Tire objects would have an independent lifetime separate from when the Car object was deleted.

With his friend the Reverend John McLeod Campbell he attempted a revision of Calvinism. Life Erskine was the youngest son of David and Ann Erskine. His great- grandfather was Colonel John Erskine of Carnock, near Dunfermline. The colonel's son was John Erskine of Carnock whose second son, David, was a writer to the signet, and purchased the estate of Linlathen, near Dundee; by the death without surviving issue of his elder brothers, it came into the possession of Thomas Erskine in 1816. After his father's death when he was very young, Erskine was left largely to the care of his maternal grandmother, Mrs. Graham of Airth Castle, a Stirling of Ardoch, Episcopalian and a strong Jacobite. Erskine was educated at the Edinburgh High School, a school in Durham, and the University of Edinburgh, and was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1810. He took a place in the literary society of Edinburgh. Inheriting by the death of his brother James the estate of Linlathen, Erskine retired from the bar, and gave himself up to the study of questions of theology. He travelled and made friends including Thomas Carlyle, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Alexander Ewing, F. D. Maurice, Lucien-Anatole Pr√©vost-Paradol, Alexandre Vinet, Adolphe Monod, and Madame de Broglie. He initially wrote extensively on contemporary religious controversies. In 1831 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland deposed John McLeod Campbell, minister of Rhu, for preaching the doctrine of universal atonement. Erskine strongly supported Campbell, and went further in doctrine, espousing universal reconciliation. When Erskine died at home in 1870, his last words were: \\"Lord Jesus!\\"Henderson, p. 136. Works Erskine was known as the author of: *Remarks on the Internal Evidence for the Truth of Revealed Religion (1820); * an Essay on Faith (1822); and * Unconditional Freeness of the Gospel (1828). These books all passed through several editions. Erskine also authored The Brazen Serpent (1831), and then wrote The Doctrine of Election, a lengthy treatise on the theological doctrine of predestination and interaction with Paul's Letter to the Romans, which appeared in 1837. This was the final work during his lifetime. A posthumously published work was The Spiritual Order and Other Papers (1871). Two volumes of his letters, edited by William Hanna, appeared in 1877. Views Erskine was an Episcopalian, self-taught in theology. He emphasized the loving side of God's nature, supported the universal atonement of Christ, and was critical of the typical federal theology of the Scottish Calvinism of his time.Letters of Thomas Erskine of Linlathen Thomas Erskine, ed. William Hanna ‚Äì 1878 \\"I can only say that I do not believe that thinking people will be helped to take hold of the doctrine of Universal Salvation by mere texts. \\" The work The Doctrine of Election has a purpose and theme that may be summed up as follows: > The current form of Calvinistic doctrine goes against human experience and > the real message of Scripture. The powers of good and evil, of God and the > self, strive within every person's soul. A person's 'elective will' in one's > own personality determines with which of the other two wills one chooses to > side. This last will only chooses which of the two shall be dominant. Thus, > God inwardly encourages us to choose the good, the true and the beautiful‚Äîwe > are not agents of our own good decision making, but rather we choose that > which God has already chosen for us. As Erskine studied the Bible text he became convinced that it \\"presented a history of wondrous love in order to excite gratitude, of a high and holy worth, to attract veneration and esteem. It presented a view of danger, to produce alarm; of refuge to confer peace and joy; and of eternal glory, to animate hope.\\" Remarks on the Internal Evidence for the Truth of Revealed Religion, p. 40. A quote shows some of his thinking: > Christ, the gift of God's present forgiving love to every man and woman, is > the door through which alone we can enter into our provision of hope. Until > we know the love of our Father's heart to us, as manifested in Christ, the > future must always be to us at best a dark and doubtful wilderness. But when > we know that all that we have conceived of our Father's love, is as nothing > to the reality‚Äîthat he is indeed love itself‚Äîa love passing knowledge‚Äîa > shoreless, boundless, bottomless ocean-fountain of love, of holy, sin- > hating, sin-destroying love, which longs over us that we should be filled > with itself‚Äîand be by it delivered from the power of evil‚Äîthen, indeed, we > are saved by hope, for we know that love must triumph and fulfill all its > counsel.Cf. The Brazen Serpent, p. 122. Reputation In his day and time Erskine was influential on theologically forward-thinking pastors and theologians. The German church historian Otto Pfleiderer \\"regard[ed] [Erskine's] ideas as the best contribution to dogmatics which British theology has produced in the present century.\\"The Development of Theology in Germany since Kant, and its Progress in Great Britain since 1825, p. 382.

It was founded in 1973 on the campus of the University of South Dakota. The NMM is recognized as \\"A Landmark of American Music\\" by the National Music Council. The NMM's renowned collections, which include more than 15,000 American, European, and non-Western instruments from all cultures and historical periods, are among the world's most inclusive. They include many of the earliest, best preserved, and historically most important instruments known to survive. The quality and scope of the NMM has earned it international recognition. The museum is closed to the public until late 2021, due to an extensive renovation and expansion project. The museum's current director is Matt Collinsworth. Background Grand piano by Louis Bas of Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon, France, 1781. Earliest French grand piano known to survive; includes an inverted wrestplank and action derived from the work of Bartolomeo Cristofiori (ca. 1700) with ornately decorated soundboard. The NMM was founded as a partnership between The University of South Dakota, which provides staff and facilities for preservation, teaching, and research, and the Board of Trustees of the NMM, a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that is responsible for acquisitions, public exhibiting, and programming. The NMM was established around the private musical-instrument collection, numbering approximately 2500 instruments, of Arne B. Larson. Larson's son, Dr. Andr√© P. Larson, was the founding director of the museum until his retirement in 2011. The second (and current) director is Dr. Cleveland Johnson. The NMM is housed in a building (originally the University's library, built in 1910 with a grant from Andrew Carnegie's library building program). The Concert Hall has superb acoustics and provides a perfect setting for performing and recording music played on original instruments of various historical periods and cultural milieu. There is a specialized library, extensive study-storage areas, and a laboratory for the conservation and restoration of the instruments. There are violin-making tools and Baroque fittings, early harpsichord and fortepiano tuning hammers, and 1,000 brass instrument mouthpieces from virtually every turn-of-the-century manufacturer. It also has rich holdings of related objects and archival materials, such as the unequaled Salabue-Fiorini-De Wit-Hermann- Witten-Rawlins Collection of 650 violin makers' labels. The American musical instrument manufacturers archives is the largest of its kind. Scholars from around the world make frequent use of the NMM's collections and facilities, providing an important opportunity for students to meet and work with individuals on the latest scholarship on musical research. Collection Double chromatic harp, built ca. 1890 by Henry Greenway, Brooklyn, New York; one of two extant instruments of this type. The NMM is the only place in the world where one can find two 18th-century grand pianos with the specific type of action conceived by the piano's inventor, Bartolomeo Cristofori. One of these built in 1767 by Manuel Antunes of Lisbon, is the earliest signed and dated piano by a maker native to Portugal; the other, built by Louis Bas in Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon in 1781, is the earliest extant French grand piano. Other extraordinary keyboards include a Neapolitan virginal (ca. 1520), three 17th-century Flemish harpsichords (two by Andreas Ruckers), 17th- and 18th- century English, German, Portuguese, and French harpsichords, and German and Swedish clavichords. A group of 500 instruments made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the C.G. Conn Company of Elkhart, Indiana, is a resource unparalleled anywhere for historical research about a major American industry and the American band movement. The NMM's holdings by 17th- and 18th- century N√ºrnberg makers of wind instruments, including members of the Denner, Ehe, Haas, Oberlender, and Steinmetz families, as well as Ernst Busch, Paul Hainlein, Johann Benedikt Gahn, Johann Carl Kodisch, Leonhard Maussiel, Michael Nagel, and Paulus Schmidt, are unique outside of Germany. The NMM's holdings of 17th- and 18th-century Dutch woodwind instruments by such makers as Richard Haka (represented here by a soprano recorder made ca. 1690), Hendrik Richters, Philip Borkens, and Abraham van Aardenberg is unique outside of the Netherlands. The Witten-Rawlins Collection of early Italian stringed instruments crafted by Andrea Guarneri, Antonio Stradivari, three generations of the Amati family, and others by far surpasses any in Italy. Included are two 17th-century Cremonese stringed instruments preserved in unaltered condition. Additionally, the NMM preserves one of four Stradivari guitars to be seen in a museum setting, and one of only two Stradivari mandolins known to survive. The sum of these groups of American, Dutch, German, and Italian instruments is to be found nowhere else. The 1994 addition of the John Powers Saxophone Collection (Aspen, Colorado) and the Cecil Leeson Saxophone Collection and Archives (transferred from Ball State University) make the NMM the preeminent center for studying the history of the saxophone. The 1996 addition of the Rosario Mazzeo (Carmel, California) and the Bill Maynard (Massapequa, New York) Clarinet Collections make the NMM the preeminent center for studying the clarinet. The 1999 addition of the Joe & Joella Utley (Spartanburg, South Carolina) Collection and the establishment of the Utley Institute for Brass Studies makes the NMM the preeminent center for studying the history of brass instruments. The Alan Bates Harmonica Collection and Archives (Wilmington, Delaware), received as a gift in 2000, is second in size and importance only to the Harmonika Museum in Trossingen, Germany. The 2005 gift of the D'Angelico, D'Aquisto, Gudelsky Workshop was the focus of a major exhibition, \\"Great American Guitars\\" (by D'Angelico, D'Aquisto, Fender, Gibson, Martin, and Stromberg-Voisinet). In April 2007, the Museum outbid New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art at a Christie's auction in acquiring a rare English cittern dating from the late 16th century, \\"This instrument is extremely rare, probably the only English cittern from the Renaissance known to survive,\\" Museum Director Andre Larson said. \\"We already have an Italian cittern from the same period, but it's one of two or three that have survived.\\" See also * List of museums in South Dakota * Music of South Dakota * List of Carnegie libraries in South Dakota * List of music museums External links * National Music Museum website * The Renaissance Cittern Site: Informational page about the NMM English cittern Category:Museums established in 1973 Category:University museums in South Dakota Category:University of South Dakota Category:Music museums in the United States Category:History museums in South Dakota Category:Museums in Clay County, South Dakota Category:Musical instrument museums in the United States Category:Institutions accredited by the American Alliance of Museums Category:1973 establishments in South Dakota Category:Buildings and structures in Vermillion, South Dakota ","title":"National Music Museum"},{"id":"266696","text":"Alexander Ewing (25 March 1814 ‚Äì 22 May 1873) was a Scottish church leader. He was born of an old Highland family in Aberdeen, Scotland. In October 1838 he was admitted to deacon's orders, and after his return from Italy he took charge of the episcopal congregation at Forres, and was ordained a presbyter in the autumn of 1841. In 1847 he was consecrated bishop of the newly united Diocese of Argyll and The Isles, the duties of which position he discharged till his death. In 1851 he received the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford. Though hampered by poor health, he worked cheerfully, and his personal charm and Catholic sympathies gradually won him a prominent position. In theological discussion he was tolerant, and attached little importance to ecclesiastical authority and organization. His own theological position had close affinity with that of Thomas Erskine of Linlathen and Frederick Denison Maurice; but his opinions were independent. The trend of his teaching is only to be gathered from fragmentary publications‚Äîletters to the newspapers, pamphlets, special sermons, essays contributed to the series of Present Day Papers, of which he was the editor, and a volume of sermons entitled Revelation considered as Light. Besides his strictly theological writings, Ewing was the author of the Cathedral or Abbey Church of Iona (1865), the first part of which contains drawings and descriptive letterpress of the ruins, and the second a history of the early Celtic church and the mission of St Columba. Ewing's daughter Margaret Nina married Alexander Crum printer and MP in 1863.

There were four wildfires in this series, which spanned the years of 1933‚Äì1951. By association, the name Tillamook Burn also refers to the location of these fires. This event is an important part of the local history of Oregon. First fire (1933) The Tillamook burn photographed in 1941 The first fire started in a ravine at the headwaters of Gales Creek on August 14, 1933. The exact cause of the first fire is unknown; however, the common narrative states that as the crews were wrapping up operations early due to fire hazard restrictions, a steel cable dragging a fallen Douglas fir rubbed against the dry bark of a wind-fallen snag. The snag burst into flame, and the wildfire that grew out of this burned before it was extinguished by seasonal rains on September 5.Tillamook Burn reforested after three blazes. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. An oppressive, acrid smoke filled the neighboring valleys; ashes, and cinders, and the charred needles of trees fell in the streets of Tillamook; and debris from the fire reached ships at sea. A Civilian Conservation Corps member was the only known human casualty of fighting the fire. The loss in processed lumber was estimated to have been $442.4 million in contemporary (1933) dollars‚Äîa serious loss not only to the timber industry at the time, but also to a nation struggling with the Great Depression. A massive salvage operation was immediately begun to harvest usable portions of the burned wilderness. The speed with which a forest fire can spread in heavy fuels under the most hazardous conditions is well illustrated by this fire. From August 14 at 1 p.m. until the early morning of August 24 the fire had burned about and it appeared that it might be brought under control soon. Thus, for over 10 days it had burned at an average rate of about a day. On August 24, the humidity dropped rapidly to 26 percent and hot gale force winds from the east sprang up. During the next 20 hours of August 24 and 25 the fire burned over an additional , or at a rate of per hour along a front. The fire was stopped only by the fact that the wind ceased and a thick, wet blanket of fog drifted in from the ocean. PROBLEMS OF FIRE IN NUCLEAR WARFARE Jerald E. Hill Rand Corporation Santa Monica, California 21 August 1961. pg 25 Second fire (1939) The second fire was started in 1939, allegedly by another logging operation. It burned before being extinguished, and was contained within the bounds of the earlier fire. Third fire (1945) A third fire started on the morning of July 9, 1945, near the Salmonberry River, and was joined two days later by a second blaze on the Wilson River, started by a discarded cigarette. This fire burned before it was put out. The cause of the blaze on the Salmonberry River was mysterious, and many believed it had been set by an incendiary balloon launched by the Japanese (due to the fire occurring in the waning days of World War II), which had been carried to Oregon by the jet stream. The third fire was perhaps the best known, after the initial wildfire, because it affected much of the forested mountains along the popular highways between Portland and the recreational destinations of the ocean beaches. This devastation remained visible to any traveler through the area as late as the mid-1970s. Fourth fire (1951) The last fire started in 1951, and burned only . It was also confined within the burned-over area.  Salvage operations  Immediately after the first fire, new logging camps formed and existing ones expanded operations. At the time, access to the forest was limited and the railroad lines did not yet extend into the inner reaches of the forest. The town of Timber expanded during the time and became a prominent logging town along with the smaller town of Cochran to the west. Some of the logging companies near Glenwood joined their operations to form the Consolidated Timber Company. The lumber from these operations played an important part in providing wood resources to the United States during World War II. Throughout the subsequent years, miles of roads and railroad lines and were built through the forest to the various logging camps providing enhanced access. This made it easier for forestry restoration, maintenance, and fire prevention operations allowing them eventually to get a handle on the continued series of burns, however it had the secondary effect of creating new issues with erosion among a terrain known for landslides. Restoration The repeated fires led some to think that large wildfires in the area were inevitable and that the land was now too damaged from the intense heat to ever again sustain forests.See Lucia, supra, at 65. But determined efforts by Oregonians -- private citizens, government officials, land owners and many others -- resulted in efforts to restore The Burn, beginning with hearings during World War II under Judge H. D. Kerkman of Washington County and eventually resulting in a decades-long reforestation program.See Lucia, supra, at 135 et seq. Much of the lands of the Tillamook burn had come to be owned by the counties of Tillamook, Yamhill, and Washington through foreclosures on unpaid property taxes; at the time of the forest fires, most of the land was owned by timber companies, which also paid the cost of fighting the fires. A measure was submitted by the Legislative Assembly to the voters to float a bond to finance reforestation, which narrowly passed in 1948. In a book published that same year, Stewart Holbrook wrote about the Tillamook Burn in Northwest Corner: Oregon and Washington: > [Reforestation] can never compensate for that tragedy we call the Tillamook > Burn, as somber a sight as to be viewed this side of the Styx. There they > stand, millions of ghostly firs, now stark against the sky, which were green > as the sea and twice as handsome, until an August day of 1933, when a tiny > spark blew into a hurricane of fire that removed all life from of the finest > timber even seen. It was timber, too, that had been 400 years in the making. > It was wiped out in a few seething hours which Oregon will have reason to > remember well past the year 2000. To this day the forest stands powerless > against the threat of wildfires. Reforestation was performed simultaneously with research by the forest industry into the best methods of growing and planting the young trees (including how to protect them from the ravages of deer, beavers, mice and other wildlife). Young people from northwest Oregon helped with the hand- planting of seedlings. Between 1949 and 1972, they planted about a million seedlings, a massive number but still only about 1 percent of the total of 72 million seedlings replanted by all means. Everything from state prisoners to newly designed helicopters played a part in the reseeding program over the years.Lucia, supra, at 185 and 215. Eventually the forest began to return and in 1973, Oregon Governor Tom McCall dedicated the Tillamook Burn as the Tillamook State Forest. At the time the reforestation of the Tillamook Burn began, some assumed that the forest land would, when the trees were mature, be harvested for lumber. Current environmental beliefs have questioned this assumption, and both the proportions and specific parts of this land that will be logged or conserved for wildlife are in dispute. Pop culture Folk singer Sufjan Stevens references the Tillamook Burn in his song 'Fourth of July' from his album Carrie and Lowell. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTeKpWp8Psw Poet and author Albert Drake titled a 1970s book of poems and essays, Tillamook Burn, from his experiences growing up in Oregon.

John McLeod Campbell (4 May 1800 ‚Äì 27 February 1872) was a Scottish minister and Reformed theologian. In the opinion of one German church historian, contemporaneous with Campbell, his theology was a highpoint of British theology during the nineteenth century.Otto Pleiderer, The Development of Theology in Germany since Kant and its Progress in Great Britain since 1825, Macmillan and Co., New York, New York, 1890, p. 382\\\\. \\"I regard their (Thomas Erskine of Linlathen's and John Mcleod Campbell's) ideas as the best contribution to dogmatics which British theology has produced in the present century.\\" James B. Torrance ranked him highly on the doctrine of the atonement, placing Campbell alongside Athanasius of Alexandria and Anselm of Canterbury.James B. Torrance, Scottish Journal of Theology, #26, 1973, p. 295. Campbell took his cue from his close reading of the early Church Fathers, the historic Reformed confessions and catechisms, John Calvin, Martin Luther's commentary on Galatians, and Jonathan Edwards' works.On this the reading of The Whole Proceedings..., shows how widely read Campbell really was, particularly with regard to Reformed theology outside of the Westminster Standards. That he continued reading widely may be seen in his dialogue in On the Nature of the Atonement with past theologians like Martin Luther, John Owen, Jonathan Edwards, and contemporary theologians like Pye Smith, George Payne, Thomas Jenkyns, Thomas Chalmers, and others. Early life Campbell was born on 4 May 1800 in Argyllshire, Scotland, the oldest child of the Rev. Donald Campbell. His mother died when Campbell was only 6, in 1806. Educated chiefly at home by his father, Campbell was already a good Latin scholar when he went to the University of Glasgow in 1811. Finishing his course in 1817, he became a student at the Divinity Hall, where he gained some reputation as a Hebraist. After further training at the University of Edinburgh Campbell was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Lorne in 1821. In 1825 he was appointed to the parish of Row (now Rhu) on the Gareloch and the Clyde coast. There drunkenness was frequent, fights common, and smuggling ordinary; religion was conceived only as offering safety from the anger of God and so prayers and worship rang hollow and were often hypocritical. There was little joy in their Christianity.See on this On the Nature of the Atonement, p. 43. Campbell preached universal atonement; and the presbytery in 1829 reviewed the orthodoxy of his preaching and teaching. At issue was the theology of Campbell in his sermons and its relationship and uniformity with the Westminster Standards which all Scottish ministers agreed to preach and teach at their ordination. A first petition was withdrawn; but a subsequent appeal in March 1830 led to a presbyterial visitation, and an accusation of heresy. Campbell clearly disagreed with the Westminster Confession of Faith's view of a limited atonement, and he was removed from the ministry. The General Assembly, by which the charge was ultimately considered, found Campbell guilty of teaching heretical doctrines and deprived him of his living.Geddes MacGregor, The Harvard Theological Review, #43 (1985), p. 281\\\\. MacGregor states that there were five levels of ecclesiastical discipline available to the Assembly in dealing with Campbell. (1.) Admonition, (2.) Rebuke, (3.) Suspension, (4.) Deposition, and (5.) Excommunciation. As MacGregor points out \\"deposition was a ferocious penalty...resorted to only in the most serious cases.\\" p. 281\\\\. On Campbell's breadth of education and reading, MacGregor is most instructive. See page 289 where he states that Campbell was better read in the Church fathers, and in Reformation theology than most of his colleagues who judged him so harshly. Several issues came into play, not least that Campbell did not support either of the theological parties in the Assembly, the Moderates or the Evangelicals.J. H. Leckie, The Expository Times: Books that Have Influenced our Epoch, #40 (1929), p. 199\\\\. \\"When his trial came he was without influential friends.\\" Declining an invitation to join Edward Irving in the Catholic Apostolic Church, he worked for two years as an evangelist in the Scottish Highlands. In Glasgow Returning to Glasgow in 1833, Campbell was minister for sixteen years in a large chapel specially built for him by close friends. In 1859 his health gave way, and he advised his congregation to join the Barony church, where Norman Macleod was pastor. Later years In 1868 he received the degree of D.D. from Glasgow University for his theological work and writing. He and his friends took it to be a reaching out on the part of the Scottish church towards him so long after his deposition from the ministry. It was clear that his book on the atonement was significant and required some response. In 1870 he moved to Rosneath, and there began his Reminiscences and Reflections, an unfinished work published after his death by his son. Campbell had a close circle of friends, which included Thomas Erskine, Norman McLeod, Alexander Ewing, Frederick Maurice and C. J. Vaughan. In 1871 a testimonial, dinner and address were presented to him by representatives of most of the religious bodies in Scotland. He died in early 1872 from prostate cancer. He was buried in Rosneath churchyard. Works Jonathan Edward's question regarding the atonement, one of the prompts for Campbell's work, was: \\"Could God be satisfied by Christ's earnest and honest repentance on behalf of humanity, or was his death necessary for satisfaction, forgiveness, and atonement to occur?\\" Asked in another way, did Christ have to die to effect atonement, or was there another way for atonement to take place? Campbell also was pastorally sensitive to the attitude of his parishioners in living as Christians. He discovered that their Christianity was essentially joyless and depressing. Campbell's influence may be seen particularly in the work of Hugh Ross Mackintosh, Donald Baillie, and most notably in Thomas F. Torrance and James B. Torrance. Later Scottish theology affirmed Campbell's influence in its departure from the strict reading of Westminster's Standards. Campbell, through the influence of the Torrance brothers, has begun to be appreciated as a pastoral theologian. In 1856 Campbell published The Nature of the Atonement, which profoundly influenced Scottish theology. Campbell's theological aim was to view the Atonement in the light of the Incarnation. In the Atonement, one may not separate the birth, person, work, and death of Jesus Christ. As one looks more closely at Christ, one may discover that the divine mind in Christ is the mind of perfect obedient sonship towards God and perfect brotherhood towards men. Jesus Christ in his person fulfills the law to love God wholeheartedly and to love neighbor selflessly. By the light of this divine fact of the Incarnation, Christ's life as atonement, vicariously lived in humanity's place, is seen to develop itself naturally and necessarily as a perfect and complete reconciliation; the penal element in the sufferings of Christ is but one aspect or facet of the atonement. There is some disagreement among scholars as to whether Campbell is rightly accused of denying the penal substitutionary theory of the atonement with his alternate view. Some would argue that he believed that rather than bearing the sin of humanity, Christ confessed humanity's sin on their behalf. A closer reading of his magnum opus belies this inaccurate view. His vicarious confession is just one part of his mediatorial, vicarious and representative work (as part of his person). Is Christ's death alone sufficient? Or does the nature of the atonement require an additional depth to his death with the addition of his confession of sin on humanity's behalf and his rightful recognition of God's just punishment? McLeod Campbell was clear on Christ's substitutionary death, but developed his theory to add to what he perceived to be a too frequent weakness on the part of previous theories. How participatory does Christ's work have to be in order for it to be effective? His reading of Phineas's zeal in Numbers 25 as making atonement is most instructive in this regard. Some critics have argued that Campbell's position was not self-consistent in the place assigned to the penal and expiatory element in the sufferings of Christ, nor adequate in its recognition of the principle that the obedience of Christ perfectly affirms all righteousness and so satisfies the holiness of God, thus effecting a peace and reconciliation between God and humanity‚Äîa true atonement. Others would vociferously disagree. Campbell sought, through his work, to change the dominant paradigm of atonement theory. There are those who suggest he succeeded; while others who argue he did not. He sought, with his atonement theory, to move from a purely legal framework (based as it is in the Latin West) to a filial and familial one (more in keeping with the Orthodox East). This change in language and the concepts behind it is partly to blame for the variety of views regarding whether he ultimately succeeded or failed. In 1862 Campbell published Thoughts on Revelation and a few years later (1869) he published a revised version of his 1851 book: Christ the Bread of Life. Family Campbell married Mary Campbell, daughter of John Campbell of Ardnahua, Kilninver. Their marriage was looked upon unfavorably by his family because of Mary's lower social standing. McLeod Campbell, however, was deeply in love with her and did not let the social inequality stand in the way of their union. As a result, it was years before his family resumed communication and correspondence with him.Gael Turnbull, noted Scottish poet and Campbell family historian, personal correspondence. The union produced James Macnabb Campbell.

It can be found used in various financial documents including the latest departmental and agency annual accounts. It was the name of a British government department responsible for the collection and the management of taxes and revenues; of making payments on behalf of the sovereign and auditing official accounts. It also developed a judicial role along with its accountancy responsibilities and tried legal cases relating to revenue. Similar offices were later created in Scotland around 1200 and in Ireland in 1210. Origin of the name The Exchequer was named after a table used to perform calculations for taxes and goods in the medieval period. According to the Dialogue concerning the Exchequer, an early medieval work describing the practice of the Exchequer, the table was large, 10 feet by 5 feet with a raised edge or \\"lip\\" on all sides of about the height of four fingers to ensure that nothing fell off it, upon which counters were placed representing various values. The name Exchequer referred to the resemblance of the table to a chess board (French: √©chiquier) as it was covered by a black cloth bearing green stripes of about the breadth of a human hand, in a chequer-pattern. The spaces represented pounds, shillings and pence.King John of England: Royal Licenses to Export and Import, 1205‚Äì1206 Dialogue concerning the Exchequer Internet Medieval Sourcebook publ by Fordham University, New York.

Exchequer of Normandy The operation of an exchequer in Normandy is documented as early as 1180. This exchequer had broader jursidiction than the English exchequer, dealing in both fiscal and administrative matters. The Dialogue concerning the Exchequer presents it as a general belief that the Norman kings established the Exchequer in England on the loose model of the Norman exchequer, while noting with some doubt an alternative view that the Exchequer existed in Anglo-Saxon times. The specific chronology of the two exchequers' foundings remains unknown.  Exchequer in England and Wales  It is unknown exactly when the Exchequer was established, but the earliest mention appears in a royal writ of 1110 during the reign of King Henry I. The oldest surviving Pipe Roll is that of 1130.Chrimes Administrative History pp. 62‚Äì63 Pipe Rolls form a mostly continuous record of royal revenues and taxation; however, not all revenue went into the Exchequer, and some taxes and levies were never recorded in the Pipe Rolls. Under Henry I, a procedure adopted for the audit involved the Treasurer drawing up a summons to be sent to each sheriff, who was required to answer with an account of the income in his shire both from royal demesne lands and from the county farm (a form of local taxation). The Chancellor of the Exchequer then questioned him concerning debts owed by private individuals. By 1176, the 23rd year of the Reign of Henry II which is the date of the Dialogue concerning the Exchequer,Dialogue concerning the Exchequer the Exchequer was split into two components: the purely administrative Exchequer of Receipt, which collected revenue, and the Exchequer of Pleas, a law court concerned with the King's revenue. Appeals were to the Court of Exchequer Chamber. Following the proclamation of Magna Carta, legislation was enacted whereby the Exchequer would maintain the realm's prototypes for the yard and pound. These nominal standards were, however, only infrequently enforced on the localities around the kingdom. From the late 1190s to the expulsion of the Jews in 1290, there was a separate division for taxation of Jews and the law- cases arising between Jews and Christians, called Exchequer of the Jews (Latin: Scaccarium Judaeorum).Joe Hillaby (2003) \\"Jewish Colonisation in the Twelfth Century\\" In Patricia Skinner (ed.)

London: Office of the Jewish Chronicle; reprinted from Papers of the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exposition, pp. 170‚Äì230. Through most of the 1600s, goldsmiths would deposit their reserve of treasure with the Exchequer, sanctioned by the government. Charles II \\"shut up\\" the Exchequer in 1672, forbidding payments from it, in what Walter Bagehot described as \\"one of those monstrous frauds... this monstrous robbery\\". This ruined the goldsmiths and the credit of the Stuart government, which would never recover it. In 1694, the credit of William III of England's government was so bad in London that it could not borrow, which led to the foundation of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The records of the Exchequer were kept in the Pell Office, adjacent to Westminster Hall, until the 19th century. The office was named after the skins (then \\"pells\\" or pelts) from which the rolls were made.Urbanus Records of the Exchequer.

Pickering.(book review) Google books = Officers = = Reform and decline= In the 19th century, a number of reforms reduced the role of the Exchequer, with some functions moved to other departments. The Exchequer became unnecessary as a revenue collecting department in 1834 with the reforms of Prime Minister William Pitt, who also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The government departments collecting revenue then paid it directly to the Bank of England, with all money previously paid to the Exchequer being credited to the Consolidated Fund. In 1866, the Standards Department of the Board of Trade took over metrological responsibilities and audit functions were combined with those of the Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts under the new post of Comptroller and Auditor General. The name continued as the Exchequer and Audit Department from 1866 until 1983 when the new National Audit Office was created.‚ÄúThe Audit Commission‚Äù by Couchman V. in Sherer & Turley: Current Issues in Auditing, Paul Chapman Publishing (1997) In modern times, \\"Exchequer\\" has come to mean the Treasury and, colloquially, pecuniary possessions in general; as in \\"the company's exchequer is low\\".  Exchequer in Scotland  The Scottish Exchequer dates to around 1200, with a similar role in auditing and royal revenues as in England. The Scottish Exchequer was slower to develop a separate judicial role; and it was not until 1584 that it became a Court of Law, separate from the King's council. Even then, the judicial and the administrative roles were never completely separated as with the English Exchequer. In 1707, the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1707 (6 Ann. c. 53) reconstituted the Exchequer into a law court on the English model, with a Lord Chief Baron and four Barons. The court adopted English forms of procedure and had further powers added. This was done in Section 19 of the Act of Union 1707Section XIX, \\"And that there be a Court of Exchequer in Scotland after the Union, for deciding Questions concerning the Revenues of Customs and Excises there, having the same power and authority in such cases, as the Court of Exchequer has in England\\": From 1832, no new Barons were appointed; their role was increasingly assumed by judges of the Court of Session. By the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1856 (19 & 20 Vict. c. 56), the Exchequer became a part of the Court of Session. A Lord Ordinary acts as a judge in Exchequer causes. The English forms of process ceased to be used in 1947. Exchequer of Ireland The Exchequer of Ireland developed in 1210 when King John of England reorganized the governance of his Lordship of Ireland and brought it more in line with English law. It consisted of the Superior Exchequer, a court of equity and revenue akin to the Exchequer of Pleas, and the Inferior Exchequer. The latter were the treasurers who handled all logistics from collecting the money (Teller or Cashier), logging it (Clerk of the Pells) and signing money orders accepting or paying money. It was managed by its own Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland and Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. The Court of Exchequer (Ireland) existed from about 1299 to 1877. It was abolished under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 and was merged, along with the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), the Court of Chancery (Ireland) and the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), into the new High Court of Justice in Ireland (now replaced by the High Court). The Central Fund, the Republic of Ireland's equivalent of the UK's Consolidated Fund, is colloquially called the Exchequer when distinguished as a component of government funding.

A handkerchief is also sometimes used as a purely decorative accessory in a suit pocket; it is then called a pocket square. It is also an important accessory in many folk-dances in many regions like the Balkans and the Middle East; an example of a folk-dance using handkerchiefs is Kalamatianos. Modern usage The material of a handkerchief can be symbolic of the socio-economic class of the user, not only because some materials are more expensive, but because some materials are more absorbent and practical for those who use a handkerchief for more than style. Handkerchiefs can be made of cotton, cotton-synthetic blend, synthetic fabric, silk, or linen. Handkerchiefs are also used as an impromptu way to carry around small items when a bag or basket is unavailable. They could also serve as a substitute for a bandage over a small injury. In the United Kingdom, the habit of wearing a handkerchief with tied corners on one's head at the beach has become a seaside postcard stereotype. From the late 18th century white handkerchiefs were waved, generally by women (men usually waved their hats), to demonstrate approval at public events such as processions or political rallies.\\"Mr. PITT's carriage was nearly the last...he was received with very general applause; the ladies waving their white handkerchiefs from the windows as he passed.\\" \\"The Procession To St. Paul's.\\" Times [London, England], 20 December 1797, p.2General Lafayette was greeted on a visit to Providence, R.I., by \\"nearly 200 Misses, arrayed in white,\\" who strewed flowers in his path \\"at the same time waving their white handkerchiefs.\\" \\"Lafayette In America.\\" Times [London, England] 16 October 1824, p. 2 Using handkerchiefs to accentuate hand movements while dancing is a feature of both West African and African-American traditional dance, in the latter case especially in wedding celebrations.'Information About Dancing And Waving White Handkerchiefs In Ewe Cultures Of Ghana & Togo And The Igbo Culture Of Nigeria' Edited by Azizi Powell Handkerchiefs are also traditional accoutrements in certain kinds of English folk dance, such as the Morris dance. Besides their intended use, they could be used for cleaning equipment, polishing shoes, cleaning hands and face, signalling for attention, as a sweat band, neckerchief, as protection from dust inhalation, to repair footwear, cut out pieces to patch clothes, cut up as emergency firearms cleaning patches, Molotov cocktail wick (fire-bomb), hot cooking utensil holder, a makeshift bandage, tourniquet, or arm sling. Origin Before people used the word handkerchief, the word kerchief alone was common. This term came from two French words: couvrir, which means ‚Äúto cover,‚Äù and chef, which means ‚Äúhead.‚Äù In the times of ancient Greece and Rome, handkerchiefs were often used the way they are today. But in the Middle Ages, kerchiefs were usually used to cover the head. Then in the 16th century, people in Europe began to carry kerchiefs in their pockets to wipe their forehead or their nose. To distinguish this kind of kerchief from the one used to cover the head, the word \\"hand\\" was added to \\"kerchief\\". King Richard II of England, who reigned from 1377 to 1399, is widely believed to have invented the cloth handkerchief, as surviving documents written by his courtiers describe his use of square pieces of cloth to wipe his nose.Tuchman, Barbara. A Distant Mirror, 473. Certainly they were in existence by Shakespeare's time, and a handkerchief is an important plot device in his play Othello. Pocket square Suits with pocket handkerchief In addition to carrying for practical purposes, handkerchiefs have long been displayed in the chest pocket of men's jackets. Used in this way, they are referred to as a pocket handkerchief or pocket square. A traditional pocket square will have the hem rolled, contrary to handkerchiefs. The trend of pocket squares as a fashion accessory really started during the 1920s, and continued until the 1960s. During that period, actors such as Cary Grant, Fred Astaire and Gary Cooper wore them regularly. The pocket square subsequently fell into disuse until the late 2000s when it made a comeback thanks in part to popular television shows such as Mad Men. Pocket squares are usually made in fabrics such as silk, cotton, linen or wool. As a visible fashion item there are a wide variety of ways to fold a pocket square, ranging from the austere to the flamboyant: * The Presidential, or Flat Fold, perhaps the simplest, is folded at right angles to fit in the pocket. * The Winged Puff, a simple and elegant fold. * The Puff or the Cooper is simply shaped into a round puff. * The Reverse Puff, or The Crown Fold, is like the Puff, except with the puff inside and the points out, like petals. * The Westo Four Point fold, the quickest way to achieve a four-point fold effect. * The TV Fold looks similar but is folded diagonally with the point inside the pocket. * The One-point Fold is folded diagonally with the point showing. * The Two-point Fold is folded off-center so the two points do not completely overlap. * The Three-point Fold is first folded into a triangle, then the corners are folded up and across to make three points. * The Four-point Fold is an off-center version of the Three- point Fold. * The Cagney is basically a backwards version of the Four-point Fold. * The Astaire is a puff with a point on either side. * The Straight Shell is pleated and then folded over to give the appearance of nested shells. * The Diagonal Shell is pleated diagonally and then folded.

It is bounded by Mercer Street to the west and the Bowery to the east, and from East 9th Street in the north to East Houston Street in the south. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has declared most of the 125-building area a historic district, divided into the NoHo Historic District and the NoHo East Historic District, created in 2003. History In 1748, Jacob Sperry, a physician from Switzerland, created the city's first botanical garden near the current intersection of Lafayette Street and Astor Place. At the time, it was located about north of the developed portion of the city and served as a vacation stop for people from present-day downtown. By 1804, John Jacob Astor bought the site from Sperry and leased it to Joseph Delacroix. Delacroix built a country resort named Vauxhall Gardens on the site; the gardens had previously been located further downtown, in Tribeca. NoHo soon became an enclave for well-to-do families. Because of rapid development on Bond, Bleecker, and Great Jones Streets, it was not affordable to build houses on these streets. These streets were among the city's most elite at the time, and contained such personalities as \\"aristocratic\\" mayor Philip Hone. Therefore, in 1826, after Delacroix's lease expired, Astor carved out an upper-class neighborhood from the site with Lafayette Street bisecting eastern gardens from western homes. The street was christened by the Marquis de Lafayette in July 1825. Colonnade Row Wealthy New Yorkers, including Astor and other members of the family, built mansions along this central thoroughfare. Astor built the Astor Library in the eastern portion of the neighborhood as a donation to the city. Alexander Jackson Davis designed eye-catching row houses called LaGrange Terrace (now Colonnade Row) for speculative builder Seth Geer. Geer built the houses for the development in 1833. The area became a fashionable, upper-class residential district, and when Lafayette Street was opened in the 1820s, it quickly became one of the most fashionable streets in New York.Henderson, Mary C. (2004). The City and the Theatre: The History of New York Playhouses, a 250-year Journey from Bowling Green to Times Square. New York City: Back Stage Books. . This location made the Gardens accessible to the residents of nearby Broadway and the Bowery.Caldwell, Mark (2005). New York Night: The Mystique and Its History. New York City: Scribner. . The houses once contained such notable residents as the Astor family and the Vanderbilt family, in addition to authors Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and William Makepeace Thackeray; U.S. President John Tyler was married in these houses. In the summer of 1838, the garden's owners opened a saloon for the staging of vaudeville comic operas. Later theatre managers expanded the offerings to appeal to a wider range of patrons. By 1850, the rowdier crowds of the Bowery had mostly scared off the upper classes, and fewer people came to the Vauxhall Gardens. The theater buildings were demolished in 1855, and the gardens closed for the last time in 1859. Even so, wealthy New Yorkers lived here through the end of the 19th century. Editor and poet William Cullen Bryant and inventor and entrepreneur Isaac Singer lived in the neighborhood in the 1880s.By the 20th century, however, warehouses and manufacturing firms moved in, the elite moved to places such as Murray Hill, and the area fell into disrepair. The neighborhood became mainly a manufacturing district by the 1880s, especially around the relatively wide Bond Street. Terra cotta and brick \\"loft\\" buildings were among the new buildings being constructed in this time, and construction of such buildings continued into the 1890s, in the Greek Revival architectural style in homage to the mansions that formerly occupied the area. The demolition of upper-class buildings continued, and by 1902, the southernmost five mansions on Colonnade Row were demolished for the Wanamaker's Department Store annex. Most of the mansions on Bond Street, though, lasted through the 1930s.Gray, Christopher. \\"Streetscapes / Bond Street From Lafayette Street to the Bowery; A Block That Offers the Quintessence of NoHo\\", The New York Times, January 17, 1999. Accessed August 18, 2015. Florence Crittenton Mission, 21 Bleecker Street, 1893 Not all of NoHo was built for and by the rich and (now) famous. Two Federal architecture-style row houses on the easternmost block of Bleecker Street were once the home of the National Florence Crittenton Mission, providing a home for \\"fallen women\\". 21 Bleecker Street's entrance now bears the lettering \\"Florence Night Mission,\\" described by the New York Times in 1883 as \\"a row of houses of the lowest character\\". The National Florence Crittenton Mission was an organization established in 1883 by Charles N. Crittenton. It attempted to reform prostitutes and unwed pregnant women through the creation of establishments where they were to live and learn skills. That same block of Bleecker Street, between Lafayette and Bowery Streets in NoHo, is also home to both the Margaret Sanger Health Center, headquarters of Planned Parenthood, and the Catholic Sheen Center, immediately adjacent to it. Bleecker Street was the home of Sanger's original Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, operated from another building from 1930 to 1973. Bleecker Street now features Margaret Sanger Square, at the intersection with Mott Street. After World War II, manufacturing companies moved out of New York City and to the suburbs. By the 1950s, these spaces were rented to artists and small theatre companies. The artists had to go through extensive litigation to live and work in these spaces. By 1960, there were more artist residents than businesses in these loft spaces. Among the famous artist residents at the time were Robert Mapplethorpe, who bought a loft in NoHo; Chuck Close, who lived next to him; and street artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. The neighborhood was revitalized beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s.Elsroad, Linda. \\"Astor Place\\" in As artists began to rent lofts in the neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s, the name NoHo came into use to distinguish it from nearby SoHo. Previously, the area now comprising NoHo, SoHo, and eastern Tribeca was known as the warehouse district. The art movement of the 1970s and the preservation movements of the 1990s and 2000s also helped to revitalize the area. Preservation The Astor Place Building at 444 Lafayette Street was built in 1876 The area was declared an official city historic district by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1999. From its designation report: The NoHo Historic District was expanded in 2008. Additionally, another district in the neighborhood, the NoHo East Historic District, was created in 2003. The designations followed considerable effort by and strong support from numerous local community and preservation groups, including the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and Historic Districts Council, and together, they form a contiguous area of landmarked buildings over 21 city blocks. The 2008 extension is bounded on the west by Lafayette Street, on the east by the Bowery, on the north by East Fourth Street and on the south by Bond Street. It includes 56 buildings and a mid-block parking lot to the south and east of the existing Noho Historic District. It does not include 30 Great Jones Street, a historic building that was partially demolished in early 2008. Most of the buildings in the extension were built between the 1860s and the early 1900s, when the area had become one of the city's major commercial and manufacturing districts. By the late 1800s, larger commercial lofts in the Greek Revival style became the dominant building type. The Merchant's House Museum, at 29 East Fourth Street, is an individual historic building located just outside the eastern boundary of the Historic District. It is also a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Both the inside and outside of this 1832 house have been restored to the mid-19th century style in which merchant Seabury Tredwell and his family lived. Despite the fragility of the structure, in April 2014 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission approved construction of an eight-story hotel immediately next door. Preservationists including City Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the Historic Districts Council and the Museum itself fought the proposed hotel for years due to concern for the intact survival of the Merchant's House. The LPC approved it over the objections of engineers and architects. =Gallery= File:330 Bowery bank-theater-store.jpgThe Bouwerie Lane Theatre's Bowery facade File:SullivanNY1.jpgFacade of Louis Sullivan's Bayard‚ÄìCondict Building (built 1897‚Äì99) at 65 Bleecker Street between Broadway and Lafayette Street File:687-691 Broadway.jpg687‚Äì691 Broadway/250‚Äì254 Mercer Street was designed by J.

Since NoHo is primarily made up of loft apartments, this in turn makes it one of the most expensive and desirable neighborhoods in Manhattan. Its small size and central location also contributes to a high demand, again keeping prices high. In 2014, a one- bedroom loft could rent at an average monthly rate of US$4,000. Notable places Some individual landmarks in the NoHo Historic District include the Astor Library, the Bouwerie Lane Theater, the Bayard-Condict Building, the De Vinne Press Building. Two New York City Subway stations, Astor Place and Bleecker Street, are also landmarked. The only survivor of the 19th-century upper class era is half of the original Colonnade Row, which is also landmarked. The Gene Frankel Theater, established in 1949, is located in the landmarked 24 Bond Street building, built in 1893. Across from Colonnade Row is The Public Theater. The easternmost block of Bleecker Street houses the last remaining Federal architecture-style row houses, including two that were once the home of the Florence Night Mission, which provided a home for \\"fallen women\\". (21 Bleecker Street's entrance now bears the lettering in the flooring.) The block also houses the Planned Parenthood headquarters at the Margaret Sanger Square, adjacent to a Catholic event center.

The route is a former alignment of U.S. Route 9/State Highway Route 4 through Absecon, intersecting with State Highway Route 43 starting in the 1927 state highway renumbering. The route stayed on the alignment until 1930, when U.S. Route 9/Route 4 was bypassed to the west. The former alignment remained unnumbered until the 1953 state highway renumbering, when it was designated as Route 157.  Route description  View south at the northern terminus of Route 157 at US 9 in Absecon Route 157 begins at a large intersection with U.S. Route 30 (White Horse Pike), County Route 585 (South Shore Road), Atlantic County Route 601 (New Jersey Avenue) and Creek Road in the city of Absecon. The route heads northward along North Shore Road, passing through the local commercial districts of Absecon. Intersecting with Station Road (the highway connecting Route 157 to the Absecon train station), the route leaves the commercial district and enters the residential areas.

At an intersection with Faunce Landing Road, Route 157 turns to the northeast onto its final stretch. Continuing through the forestry, the highway intersects with several local roads and traverses near some residential homes. Still in Absecon, Route 157 becomes surrounded by residential homes, terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (Wyoming Avenue).

Route 159's western and eastern termini are both at U.S. Route 46 (US 46). Route 159 is called locally as Bloomfield Avenue, Oak Road, and Clinton Road during its length. Route 159 is a former alignment of U.S. Route 46, until the highway was bypassed in 1941. At that time, U.S. Route 46 also had the designation State Highway Route 6, and when the bypass opened in 1941, the original alignment was designated Route 6M. The 6M designation lasted just twelve years, when in 1953, it was renumbered as Route 159. Route description Route 159 approaching its northern terminus in Fairfield. Signage denoting END 159 is visible on the right side Route 159 begins at an interchange of US 46 westbound. Route 159 heads eastward, following a divided Bloomfield Avenue along a commercial strip near the Passaic River. The highway continues, crossing the river, and passing West Essex Park. Nearby to the south are the park's woodlands and to the north, across the divided highway, is a large commercial development. Right after West Essex Park ends, Route 159 comes to a Y intersection, where it leaves Bloomfield Avenue and turns to the north along Oak Road; County Route 506 begins here and runs east along Bloomfield Avenue. Route 159 begins to curve northward, and parallels the commercial development that was only accessible westbound. During the curve away from Bloomfield Avenue, the highway intersects CR 614 Spur (Brook Road) at an at-grade intersection. Route 159 continues its curve, intersecting with CR 614 (Clinton Road). The Oak Road moniker ends at that intersection, where it changes to Clinton Road, a continuation of Route 614's right-of-way. With the commercial development to the south of Route 159 now, the highway progresses its way to the north-northwest. View east along Route 159 at Brook Street in Fairfield Along Clinton Road, Route 159 passes some residences to the north, and intersects with Ray Place, which connects to the commercial development to the nearby south. There is an intersection with Ludsin Lane, which dead-ends in a local commercial area. After that, there is an intersection with Industrial Road, which serves some industrial development in the area. Route 159 begins to parallel U.S. Route 46 once again, leaving the commercial development behind. Eastbound U.S. Route 46 provides an exit to (but not an entrance from) Route 159. A short distance later, Route 159 ends at a traffic light- controlled intersection with U.S. Route 46, north of where it began. CR 627 continues the right-of-way as Plymouth Street past the eastern terminus of Route 159. Travelers on westbound US 46 who wish to travel to Route 159 must exit at Madison Road before making a left onto Plymouth Street through a jughandle intersection. History The alignment that Route 159 currently takes was originally an alignment of US 46. In 1941, construction finished of a new bypass of the communities of The Caldwells and Fairfield, where Route 159's northern terminus occurs. U.S. Route 46 at the time also had the internal designation of New Jersey State Highway Route 6, which gave the bypassed segment of 6/46 the designation of New Jersey State Highway Route 6M. Route 6M remained intact for twelve years, when the 1953 renumbering of state highways occurred. Route 6M and its parent, Route 6, were decommissioned. Route 6 remained US 46, and Route 6M was redesignated as New Jersey Route 159. The bridge taking westbound Route 159 (Bloomfield Avenue at that point) over US 46 eastbound and into US 46 westbound (at the western terminus of Route 159) was undergoing replacement, and was re-opened for traffic on December 24, 2009. Construction period is August 2009 to February 2010. Construction will continue until the end of the construction period, though the bridge is open for traffic.

It was formerly known as H. F. Verwoerd Airport. The airport is owned and operated by the Airports Company South Africa which also operates nine other airports around South Africa. The airport is located approximately two miles south of the city's central business district. In 2017, the airport served 1,620,705 passengers. History A highlight in Port Elizabeth's history was the first flight to Port Elizabeth from Cape Town in 1917, made by Major Allister Mackintosh Miller. At that time, this was considered a long distance flight, and it heralded the start of the civil aviation industry in Port Elizabeth. This flight and many more has been captured on canvas by Ron Belling and is on display at the Ron Belling Art Gallery. Port Elizabeth Airport was established in 1929 in close proximity to the city. It was initially founded by Lieutenant Colonel Miller, who needed an airfield to operate his postal service between the city and Cape Town. It was only officially opened some nine years later, in 1936, boasting a single runway, one hangar and a concrete apron. However, the foundations of this infrastructure will be removed to make room for additional vehicle parking. During World War II, the airfield was extended to accommodate 42 Air School for the Royal Air Force and 6 Squadron South African Air Force on the southern and eastern sides of the field. Commercial operations were conducted from the northern side. In 1954, it saw the landing of the first jet-propelled aircraft - five De Havilland Vampire FB9s. Construction of the permanent terminal buildings, runways and an air traffic control building began in 1950. The commercial operation was moved to an airfield at St Albans, some 25 km from the city centre, for the construction period. The new buildings were officially opened in 1955. In 1973 the apron was extended to accommodate larger aircraft and a new departures terminal was opened in 1980. The facilities served the airport community until 2000 when plans for a major terminal upgrade were drawn. These facilities served the community till 2000 when plans for a major terminal upgrade was drawn-up. The separate arrivals and departures buildings were consolidated into a single facility with a central retail area linking the departures with arrivals creating a light friendly atmosphere. This facility caters for domestic flights but can be screened off to operate a fully compliant International arrivals and departures section. Facilities Entrance Aerial view of Port Elizabeth Airport The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 08/26 is and 17/35 is . There are also 13 aircraft parking bays on the apron and the terminal building measures . The modern terminal upgrade was completed in June 2004 allowing the airport to handle up to 2 million passengers a year. In preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup runway 08/26 was going to be extended from 1,980m to 3,000m with a view to accommodating International flights, although this never happened. A number of hotels are present on or near the airport. Ground transport is provided by local taxis. The airport also has a selection of parking areas and several car rental offices, including Eurocar and Bidvest. =South African Air Force= Air Force Station Port Elizabeth is home to C Flight of 15 Squadron of the South African Air Force. It is a helicopter unit primarily tasked with maritime and landward search and rescue. There is also a branch of the South African Air Force Museum at the airport.

The west end is at an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) and Route 94 in Columbia, Warren County on the Delaware River. The east end is in the middle of the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River in Fort Lee, Bergen County while the route is concurrent with I-95 and US 1-9. Throughout much of its length, US 46 is closely paralleled by I-80. US 46 is a major local and suburban route, with some sections built to or near freeway standards and many other sections arterials with jughandles. The route runs through several communities in the northern part of New Jersey, including Hackettstown, Netcong, Dover, Parsippany-Troy Hills, Wayne, Clifton, Ridgefield Park, Palisades Park, and Fort Lee. It crosses over the Upper Passaic River at several points. The road has been ceremonially named the United Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Veterans Memorial Highway. What is now US 46 was originally designated as three separate routes. Pre-1927 Route 5 was created in 1916 to follow the road from Delaware to Denville, pre-1927 Route 12 in 1917 to follow the route between Hackettstown and Paterson, and pre-1927 Route 10 in 1917 to run between Paterson and Edgewater. In 1927, Route 6 was legislated to run from Delaware east to the George Washington Bridge, replacing portions of Routes 5 and 12 and paralleling the former Route 10, which itself became Route 5 and Route 10N, the latter being shortly removed from the state highway system. In 1936, US 46 was designated to run from US 611 in Portland, Pennsylvania east to the George Washington Bridge. The route replaced Pennsylvania Route 987 to the Delaware Bridge over the Delaware, and from there followed Route 6 across New Jersey. In 1953, the Route 6 designation was removed from US 46 in New Jersey, and later that year, the route was realigned to end at US 611 in Columbia, New Jersey, replacing a part of Route 94\\\\. US 611 had been brought into New Jersey by two new bridges over the Delaware River, following a freeway between them that became a part of I-80. In 1972, US 611 was aligned back into its original Pennsylvania route (which from 1953 until US 611 decommission was US 611 Alternate), and US 46's western terminus remained as an interchange ramp with I-80 and Route 94\\\\. Route description =Warren County= View west along US 46 at Grand Avenue in Hackettstown US 46 begins at a complex interchange with I-80 and Route 94 near the Portland‚ÄìColumbia Toll Bridge leading to Pennsylvania Route 611 in the community of Columbia in Knowlton Township, Warren County. From this interchange, the route heads southeast along the east bank of the Delaware River as a four-lane divided highway briefly before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. The road passes through wooded mountainous areas before reaching the community of Delaware. In Delaware, US 46 intersects Route 163, the approach to the former Delaware Bridge, before passing a few commercial establishments. From here, the route continues alongside the river, passing more rural areas of woods and farms with occasional development as it enters White Township. US 46 makes a sharp turn to the east away from the Delaware River, widening into a four-lane divided highway again as it bypasses the town of Belvidere and has a few businesses on it. The road turns back into a two-lane undivided road and comes to a crossroads with CR 519\\\\. Past this intersection, US 46 continues through rural sectors with some business before coming to the northern terminus of Route 31. From this point, the route continues east through dense woods prior to turning northeast into Liberty Township. The road passes through the community of Townsbury before crossing into Independence Township. Here, US 46 enters more agricultural areas and turns east again, with development increasing along the road as it passes through Great Meadows-Vienna. It continues southeast before entering Hackettstown, where the road becomes Main Street. In Hackettstown, the route crosses NJ Transit's Morristown Line and Montclair-Boonton Line before coming to an intersection with CR 517\\\\. Here, CR 517 forms a concurrency with US 46, and the two routes continue southeast through the downtown area. At the intersection with the northern terminus of Route 182, CR 517 splits from US 46 by heading south on that route while US 46 continues to the east. =Morris and Essex counties= US 46 westbound in Roxbury TownshipShortly after the Route 182 intersection, the route crosses the Musconetcong River into Washington Township, Morris County, where it heads back into rural surroundings. About a mile into Morris County, US 46 divides and becomes a four-lane highway with a wide median. The road passes a median park and ride lot as it turns north and crosses over a mountain. It continues into Mount Olive Township, taking a sharp turn to the east before the road becomes undivided while remaining four lanes. The road passes rural areas and development as it goes through Budd Lake. In this community, the route passes to the south of the namesake lake as it begins to turn northeast and then north. The road heads northeast again before it enters Netcong and becomes a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-80/US 206\\\\. Within this interchange, the lanes of US 46 split. From this point, the route narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and runs through developed areas of Netcong a short distance to the south of NJ Transit's Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. US 46 meets Route 183 at an intersection (formerly Netcong Circle) before widening into a four-lane undivided road and leaving Netcong for Roxbury Township. Here, the road passes through wooded areas, meeting I-80 at another interchange and briefly becoming a divided highway at the crossing under I-80 and again at the actual interchange. US 46 remains a divided highway with jughandles past this point, continuing southeast into the Ledgewood area. At a three-way intersection which was formerly Ledgewood Circle, Route 10 begins straight while US 46 turns left to continue east as a two-lane undivided road through more development, crossing the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's High Bridge Branch. Upon crossing the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Chester Branch and passing through Kenvil, the road enters Mine Hill Township, where the road becomes three lanes with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. The route passes through Wharton at its southern tip before continuing into Dover. US 46 narrows back into two lanes, becoming Blackwell Street as it passes St. Clare's Dover General Hospital. The road widens to four lanes as Blackwell Street splits from it at an eastbound exit and westbound entrance prior to a bridge over the Rockaway River and NJ Transit's Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. A short distance later, US 46 intersects the southern terminus of Route 15 and passes over the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Dover and Rockaway Branch. From here, the route continues on McFarland Street. US 46 continues east, entering Rockaway Township, where there is an intersection with CR 513\\\\. Past CR 513, the road narrows to two lanes as it heads northeast through Rockaway Borough before turning east and crossing the Rockaway River and the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Dover and Rockaway Branch. The route continues northeast, entering wooded residential areas as it heads into Denville and has a limited interchange with I-80, where it can only be entered to and from the westbound lane and where US 46 east can only be entered from the eastbound lane and to the eastbound lane. As it crosses under I-80, US 46 becomes a six-lane divided highway. US 46 westbound past Route 159 in Montville Township The road is lined with a moderate number of businesses, most with right-in/right-out (RIRO) access, as it continues southeast through Denville, narrowing to four lanes before coming to an interchange with Route 53\\\\. From this interchange, the route continues east before curving southeast and entering Mountain Lakes. In Mountain Lakes, US 46 crosses under the Montclair-Boonton Line before continuing into Parsippany-Troy Hills. Here, the road comes to US 202/CR 511 before passing under I-287. At this point, the westbound direction of US 46 has a ramp to northbound I-287, with access to and from southbound I-287 provided by US 202\\\\. Past the I-287 crossing, the road comes to another partial interchange with I-80 near the western terminus of I-280. Past this interchange, US 46 widens to six lanes and enters Montville. In Montville, the route narrows back to four lanes, and has traffic light-controlled intersections with New Road and Hook Mountain Road/Chapin Road. It then has an interchange with Route 159 and makes a turn to the northeast. Upon crossing the Passaic River at Pine Brook, US 46 enters Essex County into Fairfield Township. A short distance into Essex County, US 46 has another interchange with Route 159 (Clinton Road), providing access to that route and to its continuation as CR 627 (Plymouth Street). Shortly farther along US 46, Route 159 and CR 627 meet it at a traffic light-controlled intersection, providing cross-traffic and turns onto US 46\\\\. Past this point, US 46 remains a surface road with RIRO-accessed driveways, but has several intersections controlled by interchanges. Within Fairfield, US 46 has interchanges with Hollywood Avenue and Passaic Avenue as well as two trumpet interchanges providing access to Fairfield Road, which runs a short distance to the south of US 46. =Passaic County= US 46 eastbound at exit for CR 640 in Totowa The route crosses the Passaic River again into Wayne in Passaic County. The median splits as the road passes to the north of the Willowbrook Mall, with an exit serving the mall, before reaching the Spaghetti Bowl interchange with partial access to I-80 and full access to Route 23. Within this interchange, US 46 passes under the Montclair-Boonton Line again. From here, it passes businesses and many shopping centers with RIRO access as a six-lane highway, heading into Totowa. In this area, the route has interchanges with CR 640 and Route 62/CR 646\\\\. The road turns southeast, crossing the Passaic River a third time into Little Falls. At this point, US 46 runs along the Little Falls/Woodland Park border, interchanging with CR 639 and Browertown Road. After the exit for Lower Notch Road, the route enters more wooded surroundings, interchanging with Notch Road/Rifle Camp Road before entering Clifton. Upon reaching Clifton, US 46 has an interchange with the western terminus of Route 3 and Valley Road (CR 621), with the Valley Road exit stitched into the Route 3 side of the highway fork. Prior to reconstruction of the interchanges, the Valley Road ramp exited before Route 3 began, and Route 3 branched off immediately after Valley Road. Past Route 3, the highway narrows to four lanes, continuing east-northeast as a limited-access divided highway with some RIRO-accessed businesses still on it, though many roads are accessed through over and underpasses. US 46 has an exit for Van Houten Avenue/Grove Street before coming to a large interchange with Route 19/CR 509 and the Garden State Parkway. After this, the road passes over Norfolk Southern's Newark Industrial Track line and NJ Transit's Main Line and has an exit for Hazel Street/Paulison Avenue. US 46 then begins a brief concurrency with Piaget Avenue in Clifton with a series of connector streets and three intersections controlled by stoplights. After the third, at Day Street near Christopher Columbus Middle School, the two roads split at a fork, marked as an exit, with US 46 continuing eastbound to the left and Piaget Avenue continuing to the right. Vehicles traveling west on Piaget Avenue have access to US 46 westbound through use of a one way underpass that carries US 46 eastbound over it, and also have access to US 46 eastbound by a right-turn only lane near the intersection of Piaget Avenue and Fourth Street. After the split, US 46 turns into a limited-access road again and passes under Main Avenue/CR 601 and Norfolk Southern's Passaic Spur line before coming to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 21\\\\. From this interchange, the route turns north along the west bank of the Passaic River, crossing the Garden State Parkway again before widening to six lanes and meeting the southern terminus of Route 20 at an interchange near the border of Paterson. =Bergen County= US 46 westbound in Lodi US 46 turns east and crosses the Passaic River a fourth and final time, entering Bergen County in Elmwood Park. Immediately after the river, the route has an interchange for CR 507\\\\. Passing through more RIRO-accessed business areas, the road narrows to four lanes and has a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Past the parkway, US 46 continues as a road with some jughandles and other traffic light-controlled intersections (but still largely maintaining RIRO access to driveways and side streets), crossing New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway's Dundee Branch line and passing through a small corner of Garfield before crossing into Saddle Brook. Within Saddle Brook, the road turns more to the southeast and crosses over NJ Transit's Bergen County Line. Continuing east, US 46 has an exit for with Outwater Lane and crosses into Lodi. Through this area, there is no access across the median of US 46, as it interchanges with Main Street. The route continues into Hasbrouck Heights, where it turns more south-southeast, interchanging with Boulevard. A short distance later, US 46 reaches an interchange with Route 17 and crosses NJ Transit's Pascack Valley Line near the Teterboro station. From here, US 46 enters Teterboro and interchanges with Green Street before continuing southeast as a six-lane highway through industrial areas, passing to the north of Teterboro Airport. The road continues into Little Ferry, where it passes suburban residential and commercial areas and narrows into a four-lane undivided road called Sylvan Avenue, turning to the east and crossing CR 503\\\\. After intersecting the Bergen Turnpike at the modified Little Ferry Circle, which US 46 runs through, the route crosses the Hackensack River into Ridgefield Park on the Route 46 Hackensack River Bridge, passing over New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway's New Jersey Subdivision line and CSX's River Subdivision line before the bridge ends. In Ridgefield Park, the route is called Winant Avenue and becomes a four-lane divided highway before briefly becoming undivided again. Upon turning back into a divided highway, US 46 comes to a large interchange with I-95/New Jersey Turnpike. Past this interchange, the route widens to six lanes and crosses the Overpeck Creek into Ridgefield, where it passes over CSX's Northern Running Track line. Upon entering Palisades Park, the road has an interchange with Route 93 before reaching a diamond interchange with US 1-9. US 1/9 southbound and US 46 westbound at Route 63 interchange in Fort LeeUS 46 continues southeast as a four-lane freeway, with the US 1-9 ramps following the route a short distance before merging into the route. At this point, US 1-9 become concurrent with US 46 and the freeway makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast. The road has an interchange to the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US 1-9 / US 46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access to a couple commercial areas via RIRO before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes with RIRO access, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US 1-9 / US 46 all join I-95 (although US 46 is unsigned east of this interchange) and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high- rise buildings. The road has an interchange with Route 67 at GWB Plaza before coming to the eastbound toll plaza for the George Washington Bridge. Past the toll plaza, there is an interchange for the Palisades Interstate Parkway. After the Palisades Interstate Parkway, the road crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, which has eight lanes total on the upper deck (formed from the express lanes) and six lanes total on the lower deck (formed from the local lanes). At the New Jersey/New York border on the bridge, US 46 ends while I-95 and US 1-9 continue into the borough of Manhattan in New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway. History = Before 1916 = What is now US 46 west of Netcong was part of the Manunkachunk Trail, an old Lenape trail running from the Great Minisink Trail in Netcong west to Manunkachunk Village, now Belvidere. Another Lenape trail extended from Netcong to what is now Parsippany and Springfield Township.Snyder, John (1969). \\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries 1606-1968\\" In 1809, the Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike was chartered to extend from the Newark-Pompton Turnpike to the Union Turnpike; the section east from Denville was later named Bloomfield Avenue. The Dover Turnpike was chartered in 1813 to run west from the Union Turnpike in Dover to the Morris Turnpike. By 1920, the portion of the modern route west of Hackettstown was signed as part of the Lackawanna Trail, which ran from Hackettstown through Pennsylvania to Binghamton, New York.Rand Mcnally And Company. . [New York?: Rand McNally & Co. ; Newark, N.J.: Berwick Hotel distributor, ?, 1920] Map. Retrieved from the Library of Congress, . =Routes 5, 10 and 12: 1916-1927= Bridge stamp for pre-1927 Route 5 along Route 163 (former US 46)Prior to 1927, what is today US 46 was followed by three different routes. The first route was pre-1927 Route 5, which was first legislated in 1916. It began by crossing the Delaware River from Pennsylvania at the community of Delaware. Several undercrossings of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad near Delaware were bypassed with a short new road on the southwest side of the railroad. From there, Route 5 used the existing Delaware Road to north of Belvidere, then the Buttzville-Belvidere Road to Buttzville, the Buttzville Road to Great Meadows, and the Danville Mountain Road to Hackettstown. From Hackettstown to Denville, Route 5 ran concurrently with pre-1927 Route 12, which was first legislated in 1917. A mostly-new road (now eastbound US 46) was built from Hackettstown east to Netcong to avoid steep grades on the existing roads. Portions of the existing Budd's Lake Road were used between Budd Lake and Netcong. From Netcong the route used the old Morris Turnpike to Ledgewood and the Dover Turnpike to Dover, running into Dover on Blackwell Street. Blackwell Street led to Rockaway Road, becoming Main Street in Rockaway, from which it used the old Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike to Denville. At Denville, Route 5 turned south, while Route 12 continued east along the Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike to Pine Brook. The route left the old turnpike there to head northeast towards Paterson, starting with the Pine Brook Road (now Fairfield Road and Little Falls Road) to Little Falls. A bypass was planned around the south side of Little Falls, taking it under the Erie Railroad at Union Boulevard. From there Route 12 would use Union Boulevard, Totowa Road and McBride Avenue into Paterson. Pre-1927 Route 10, which was legislated in 1917, continued east on Market Street on the other side of Paterson to Edgewater, where it connected to the Fort Lee Ferry across the Hudson River. The new alignments were generally built as planned, except at Little Falls, where a bypass was to be built for Route 12. =Route 6: 1927-1953= The expansion of the highway system followed the opening of the George Washington Bridge. In the 1927 renumbering, Route 6 was assigned to the route across northern New Jersey, using the old Route 5 from Delaware to Netcong, Route 12 from Hackettstown to Paterson, and a generally new alignment parallel to Route 10 from Paterson to the proposed George Washington Bridge; the old Route 10 alignment between Paterson and Edgewater was to become Route 5\\\\. In Paterson, Route 6 was marked along McBride Avenue, Spruce Street and Market Street.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. Route 6 was redefined in 1929 to use none of the old road east of Paterson (it had formerly been planned to use Market Street west of roughly where Route 17 now crosses it), and Route 5 was cut back to run only east from Ridgefield.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1929, Chapter 126. The portion of pre-1927 Route 10 that was bypassed by Route 6 was designated Route 10N, but was eventually removed from the state highway system.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1939, compiled. In addition, Route 6 was redefined to bypass Paterson to the south. The new route would enter Paterson just south of Market Street, but then turn south and southwest before heading back west to rejoin the old route at the east end of the Little Falls bypass at the Union Boulevard crossing. The old road along Union Boulevard towards Paterson was assigned Route S6, as a spur of Route 6. Route S6 became Route 62 in the 1953 renumbering, and has since been truncated to a short piece between US 46 and I-80 in Totowa.Wikisource:1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering By 1937, most of Route 6 had been completed with the exception of the Paterson bypass. In 1938, a spur of Route 6 called Route 6A was legislated to run from Route 6 in Dover north to US 206/Route S31 in Lafayette Township; this became Route 15 in 1953.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1938, Chapter 47 A realignment at the Passaic River crossing near Pine Brook was built in the 1940s, along with a new road for a short distance west from Pine Brook. Also in the 1940s, the road was widened west into Denville, and a bypass of downtown Denville, including an interchange at Route 5N (now Route 53) was built. The Route 6 designation was dropped in favor of US 46 in the 1953 renumbering. By Joint Resolution No. 1, approved April 14, 1941, the New Jersey Legislature designated the highway as the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in honor of the United Spanish War Veterans.State of New Jersey; Laws of 1941, Joint Resolution No. 1 =U.S. Route 46: 1936-present= US 46 westbound at exit for CR 509 southbound in Clifton In 1925, the US 46 designation was first proposed for a route in Colorado connecting Limon to Grand Junction, but it instead became US 40S. The current US 46 was marked in 1936 between Portland, Pennsylvania and the George Washington Bridge. At the time, the new Route 6 had not been completed from Route 2 (now Route 17) west to Route S6 (now Route 62), and so US 46 was marked through Paterson until this portion was completed by the 1940s. At the west end of Route 6, US 46 continued over the Delaware River on the Delaware Bridge into Pennsylvania, replacing Pennsylvania Route 987 north to Portland, where it ended at US 611\\\\. The Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge and its associated freeway to Columbia (now I-80) opened in December 1953, as did the new Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Following this, US 611 was rerouted to cross the river twice in order to use the freeway through the Delaware Water Gap, and US 46 was moved to former Route 94 (pre-1953 Route 8) to end at the Columbia, New Jersey side of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. The former approaches to the Darlington's Bridge, which itself was dismantled by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission in 1954, became Route 163 in New Jersey and State Route 1039 in Pennsylvania. The US 611 freeway was designated I-80 by 1960, and US 611 was moved back to its old all-Pennsylvania alignment by 1972, leaving US 46 to end at I-80 and Route 94. In 1964, the approach to the George Washington Bridge, shared with US 1-9, was rebuilt into a freeway that became a part of I-95. Since then, many changes have occurred to US 46.The Little Ferry Circle, initially constructed in 1933, was modified in 1985 to allow US 46 to run straight through the circle. In 1998, the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus of Route 10 was replaced with a signalized T-intersection. In 2007, the NJDOT announced that they would eliminate the Little Ferry Circle by turning it into a straight intersection; work ran through 2014. The Netcong Circle at Route 183 was replaced with a signalized intersection a cost of $13.3 million in 2013. A temporary junction opened in January of that year with the permanent configuration completed the following August. In addition, the interchange between US 46 and the western terminus of Route 3 is planned to be reconstructed. This project will reconfigure ramps, bring bridges up to standard, and will provide for three- lane connections between Route 3 and US 46\\\\. It was announced in 2003 and is projected to cost $200 million. Construction on the first contract began in December 2015 with expected completion in mid-2018. The second contract is in the final design stage. In 1988 the Legislature resolved that \\"The Commissioner of Transportation shall designate that portion of United States Highway Route 46 located between Hope Road and Barkers Mill Road in the township of Independence, Warren County as 'Clifford Jones Avenue',\\" honoring United States Army Specialist Clifford Jones, Jr., a resident of Independence Township who had been killed in action in 1968 during the Vietnam War.State of New Jersey; Laws of 1988, Joint Resolution No. 1 Major intersections See also * List of crossings of the Upper Passaic River * New Jersey Route 6A * New Jersey Route 6M * New Jersey Route S6 References External links * US 46 straight line diagram (PDF) * NJ 1920s Route 5 * NJ 1920s Route 12 * Police Scanner Frequencies for Route 46 * Speed Limits for Route 46 * Endpoints of US 46 * US 46 (Greater New York Roads) 46 46 46 U.S. Route 46 U.S. Route 46 U.S. Route 46 U.S. Route 46 U.S. Route 46 Category:Limited- access roads in New Jersey ","title":"U.S. Route 46"},{"id":"266747","text":"The term wired intelligence refers to a robot that has no programmed microprocessor.

Although it is a signed state highway, it does not connect to any other state-maintained roadways. However, the south terminus is aligned just northeast of the interchange of Route 3 and the Garden State Parkway (interchange 153). The highway originated as Route S3 Spur, a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 3 to State Highway Route 6 (currently U.S. Route 46 or US 46). The route was redesignated in 1953 as Route 161, though one late 1950s Essex County Hagstrom map and in the NJ highway code for mid-block crosswalks the highway is shown as Route 61. It is unknown whether Route 61 existed. Route description View southbound along Route 161 at Van Houten Avenue Route 161 begins at the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Allwood Road (CR 602) in Clifton. The route passes a park and large commercial building at the southern terminus. A short distance after, Route 161 provides a connector to Richfield Terrace on the northbound side of the highway, the park's divider known as Cross Street. The highway continues northward, intersecting with Richland Court, which provides access to local residential homes. The next intersection is with Joan Place, which serves a similar function to Richland Court. Soon after, Route 161 intersects with Saint Andrew's Boulevard, which also serves as the northern terminus of Richfield Terrace and connects the highway with CR 609 (Mount Prospect Avenue). Just past Saint Andrew's Boulevard Route 161 passes through a largely commercial section of Clifton with a heavy concentration of medical offices before terminating at an intersection with CR 614 (Van Houten Avenue). The right-of-way of Route 161 continues as CR 611 (Clifton Avenue) towards downtown Clifton. History Route S3 was defined in 1929 to run from Route 3 in East Rutherford west to Route 6 (US 46) in Clifton, (this is now part of Route 3). In 1942, the state took over the alignment and made it an unnumbered state highway was defined to run from the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Van Houten Avenue southwest to Route S3, which then ran along Allwood Road. World War II delayed completion of Route S3 long enough for an alternate freeway route to be selected, and the part of Allwood Road that was taken over is no longer a state highway. In 1948, the route was assigned the number Route S3 Spur. The number was changed to Route 161 in the 1953 state highway renumbering, and ever since then it has remained an isolated state highway.

Route 162 and County Route 626 date back to the 1850s, when local businessmen and county financial Richard Holmes put together the Cape May Turnpike. The turnpike was chartered in 1854, but construction did not begin until 1857, with completion in April of the next year. The turnpike however, caused a lot of controversy, and struggled to live. For many years, railroads were proposed, becoming possible competition for Holmes, who did not appreciate the idea. The railroad was constructed in 1863, just nine years after the charter of the turnpike syndicate. Route S4C was designated by the New Jersey Legislature in 1929 as a spur of Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9), beginning at Bennett and running south on Seashore Road and Broadway, past Sunset Boulevard to the Delaware Bay. Route S4C was never taken over by the state. However, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers built the Cape May Canal during World War II, Seashore Road was chosen as one of two roads to cross the canal. (The other was Route 4, now Route 109). The Army Corps built a low level bridge close to the pre-canal alignment. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) built a higher bridge in 1971 on a new alignment.  History  = The Cape May Turnpike: the precedent to Seashore Road = alt=Aerial view in black and white of the area around Cape May in 1944 Before 1854, the area based around Bridgeton was a strong business and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, wanted to have a strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 made it hard to convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities. View north along Route 162, signed as CR 626 Although local business owners and land owners held out hope that the turnpike company would pay off, the turnpike experienced problems. Richard Holmes and Henry Swain, the director of the turnpike company, were running into problems including failure to buy land from Elijah Hand's pasture and Samuel Hoffman's local residence for the turnpike route, because they kept land prices high. The farmers refused to the sell their rightful land, and locals started showing opposition due to the fact it would cost money to deliver important foods. One of those locals, John Tomlin from Goshen, soon after brought up the idea of the \\"Shunpike\\" ‚Äì a free turnpike road to the west of the Cape May Turnpike. However, the turnpike company kept pushing forward, persuading Hand and Hoffman to sell land in 1857 and erecting two tollhouses in the route, one at the Court House (now Cape May Court House) and one near Cold Spring. Eventually, locals finally began to move towards support of the turnpike. In April 1858, John Wiley, who helped persuade Hand and Hoffman to sell, announced that in three weeks, the route would be complete as one continuous road from Cape Island to Cape May Court House. Map denoting the routes around Cape May After completion of the turnpike in April‚ÄìMay 1858, the Cape May Turnpike did not receive much profits. Even with tolls being collected and stock being bought, these could not offset the costs of repairs and maintenance. The roadbed was commonly washed away in storms and it was becoming a less used route as the \\"Shunpike\\" (now Route 162/County Route 626) nearby was free to use, taking away traffic from the turnpike. Walters Miller, a big investor of the turnpike company, decided to leave the syndicate in favor of working towards railroads. Miller himself looked into the construction of railroads in the area, hiring William Cook, who engineered the Camden and Amboy Railroad into producing routes along the peninsula. Cook proposed three routes in 1852, one from the Camden waterfront to Cape May economic region, one through Millville and Bridgeton and a third through Salem. Although the rights for a railroad in the area by the New Jersey General Assembly had been allowed since 1832, there has been no progress on any railroad in Cape May County until 1863. That year, progress started on constructing the Camden and Atlantic Railroad using the first proposal by Cook in 1852. Jonathan Pitney of Absecon spent two years trying to obtain the charter from the General Assembly. In a letter to Richard Holmes, Pitney said the chances of getting the railroad charter and building it were \\"good\\". Holmes, however, was cautious towards the railroad company investment, showing little thought of having a railroad created that would compete with his struggling turnpike syndicate. Businessmen in Cape May County believed the economy in the area was still unstable for quite an engineering project. An adviser to Richard Holmes suggested to be careful on future investments that he would take, including investing into the railroad company. The adviser believed that it would be \\"bad policy\\" to make such decisions. Debate continued about the railroad line for at least a decade, and the heads of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad put forth a proposal to build a portion of railroad from Absecon to Cape May along the Tuckahoe River. After attempts to revive the railroad were attempted by several other companies (including the Glassboro and Millville Railroad), the attempts failed. An eventual formation of the Cape May and Millville Railroad in 1860 pushed forward more proposals, and a railroad was constructed in 1863 (and leased in 1869), and the alignment of Seashore Road became part of a stagecoach route from Cold Spring to Cape Island. = Route S4C and construction of Route 162 = In 1929, a route from the Delaware Bay just short of Sunset Boulevard (the former Cape Island Turnpike) northward to U.S. Route 9 at Bennett Station via Broadway and Seashore Road was designated in the state legislature as State Highway Route S4C. The route was designated along County Route 626's length along with County Route 604 as a county-maintained highway, remaining the same until January 1, 1953. On that day, State Highway Route S4C was decommissioned during the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. No number was designated to replace the highway's former number. During the 1930s and 1940s, the proposal for a canal to supply ships with an evacuation route from Germany's U-boats in World War II along with dangerous shoals of the Delaware Bay came forward. The canal, now the Cape May Canal, was approved in 1941 and was constructed in 1942 to supply this need along with a strong usage by yachts. By 1944, a bridge was constructed across the canal, which was replaced in 1971. That year, the state built a brand new bridge and denoted it as Relocated Seashore Road, a long steel girder bridge over the Canal. The bridge was built south of U.S. Route 9 and has stood since and received the designation of Route 162 upon completion.  Route description  Route 162 in Cape May At the intersection with Bridge Road and CR 641, Route 162 officially begins though the county maintains the state numbered alignment of the road from this intersection to the beginning of the Relocated Seashore Road Bridge. The route heads northward from CR 641, paralleling both roads as it heads up the bridge approach and following the shoreline. From there, Route 162 reaches the Cape May Canal, crossing on the two-lane Relocated Seashore Road Bridge for a short distance. NJDOT maintains the bridge itself but once the route returns to land on the other side of the canal, county maintenance resumes. More farms and residences can be seen from the northern approach of the bridge. Route 162 curves to the northwest, intersecting with Seashore Road (CR 603). At that intersection, Route 162 ends but Seashore Road continues once again as CR 626.

Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route 6 in 1927 and U.S. Route 46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount was a far cry from the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route 6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire. The Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April 3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.  History  A map of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad = Railroad bridge = As expansion of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;) continued westward from Hoboken, the railroad company saw the need to build a new bridge over the Delaware River. Reaching the community of Delaware (named after the river nearby), DL&W; built a train station previously in the community, denoted as Delaware Station. The new wood bridge was constructed on the railroad mainline during 1855. The structure lasted a short time, until DL&W; replaced the wooden crossing for a new long iron bridge. The new bridge had two tracks to cross the river, serving the local area with coal cars and boxcars crossing. The new bridge survived the floods in 1903 that destroyed many bridges (including the nearby Riverton-Belvidere Bridge) along the Delaware and continued to prosper. However, as trains, cars and locomotives began to get heavier and larger, the DL&W; needed to build a new bridge across the river to support the heavier weights. In 1914, they built the new bridge just upstream for the reason that it would not have to move much track for better service. As soon as the new bridge was finished, DL&W; put the former one up for sale. Demand for second- hand bridges were not high at the time, and when Henry V.B. Darlington, a local Episcopal minister, put up an offer of $5,000 (1914 USD) for the bridge, DL&W; immediately took the money. The railroad did not check on the background of Reverend Darlington or asked what he wanted to do with the iron structure. His money was \\"as good as anybody's\\", according to DL&W.; = Henry Darlington's ownership = Route 163 (former US 46), the approach to the Darlington's Bridge After Darlington bought the railroad bridge from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad he took out the tracks, replacing them with a paved roadway. Darlington knew the automobile was becoming a big entity in the 1910s and 1920s, turning the bridge into a vehicular bridge was an important decision to make the most out of the crossing. He also figured that the bridge would make a good approach for drivers coming to visit the local natural attractions, such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Pocono Mountains. Darlington created new roadway approaches (Lackawanna Road and Ferry Lane) to the bridge and even two buildings on the New Jersey side of the span. One building was for toll collecting while the other was for living quarters. These quarters were soon occupied by Edward McCracken and his wife. McCracken and his wife had come from the Meyer's Ferry, a local ferry service running at that point on the Delaware since the early 18th century. McCracken had been the local ferry operator, but when a large accident occurred during a dinner break killed four passengers, the owner put the ferry under his control and later fired McCracken. Klein later sold the ferry, which Darlington bought and shut down. He immediately hired the McCrackens to work as the toll collectors. The alignment of Route 163, which was the approach from New Jersey to the Darlington's Bridge In the meantime, the only other bridge across the Delaware River easily accessible for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers were never able to find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed. Two Airedales the McCrackens kept in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey, helped keep the place clear from thieves. In the time of the bridge prospering, Reverend Darlington was wed to Dorothy Stone Smith at the Trinity Chapel in Newark. The wedding, which occurred in November 1920, made the local news and the ceremony was performed by Darlington's father. Two years later, the Darlingtons made the news again, this time with the birth of their first child (a son) in Orange, New Jersey at Orange Memorial Hospital. = Buyout and dismantling = The bridge continued to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter to cross the bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington refused, raising the amount to $275,000. Once the bridge was brought, tolls were eliminated. Although the bridge remained in service for another 21 years as a free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission constructed a brand new bridge at the Portland-Columbia. The new toll bridge was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ today), but the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington's Bridge. Darlington, who had retired from his job in Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll Bridge Commission went ahead and dismantled the Darlington's bridge, which was fought by several legal actions. The bridge ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered bridge at Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of Darlington's Bridge, the approach on the New Jersey side had been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the bridge was in use.

Introduced alongside the Macintosh IIsi and Macintosh Classic as part of a new wave of lower-priced Macintosh computers, the LC offered the same overall performance as the Macintosh II for half the price. Part of Apple's goal was to produce a machine that could be sold to school boards for the same price as an Apple IIGS, a machine that was very successful in the education market. Not long after the Apple IIe Card was introduced for the LC, Apple officially announced the retirement of the IIGS, as the company wanted to focus its sales and marketing efforts on the LC. The original Macintosh LC was introduced on October 1990, with updates in the form of the LC II and LC III in 1992 and early 1993. These early models all shared the same pizza box form factor, and were joined by the Macintosh LC 500 series of all-in-one desktop machines in mid-1993. A total of twelve different LC models were produced by the company, the last of which, the Power Macintosh 5300 LC, was on sale until early 1997.  Overview  The LC family (LC, II, III, 475, Quadra 605) front face After Apple co-founder Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985, product development was handed to Jean-Louis Gass√©e, formerly manager of Apple France. Gass√©e consistently pushed the Apple product line in two directions, towards more \\"openness\\" in terms of expandability and interoperability, and towards higher price. Gass√©e long argued that Apple should not market their computers towards the low end of the market, where profits were thin, but instead concentrate on the high end and higher profit margins. He illustrated the concept using a graph showing the price/performance ratio of computers with low-power, low-cost machines in the lower left and high-power high-cost machines in the upper right. The \\"high-right\\" goal became a mantra among the upper management, who said \\"fifty-five or die\\", referring to Gass√©e's goal of a 55 percent profit margin. This policy led to a series of ever more expensive computers. This was in spite of strenuous objections within the company, and when a group at Claris started a low-end Mac project called \\"Drama\\", Gass√©e actively killed it. Elsewhere at the company, two engineers, H.L. Cheung and Paul Baker, had been working in secret on a pet project, a color Macintosh prototype they called \\"Spin\\". The idea was to produce a low-cost system in the vein of the Apple II, a product that Cheung had previously worked on at Apple as the head of design. The machine would, in effect, be a significantly smaller Macintosh II with built-in video, no NuBus expansion, and a matching RGB monitor similar to the one introduced with the Apple IIgs the year prior. The project changed direction during development, with executives dictating that the machine should have video capabilities and processing power similar to the Macintosh IIci, which was also under development at the time. In early 1989, the prototype was shown Apple executives, who liked the project but felt it was not different enough from existing models to justify further effort, and the project was shut down. Around the same time, Apple CEO John Sculley was facing public scrutiny for declining sales that was blamed in large part on the company's lack of an inexpensive Macintosh computer. Amidst promises to the press and investors that a new low-cost Macintosh was on the way, he revived the Spin project with the goal of creating the lowest-priced Macintosh that was possible. Gass√©e pleaded with the team to keep color as a feature of the project, and from then on the product was known internally by a new code name, \\"Elsie\\", a homonym for the \\"LC\\" (i.e. low-cost color) name the computer would later be sold as. Elsie prototypes at this point resembled an Apple IIc where the keyboard was integrated into the unit, and it had a single 800 KB floppy drive with no hard drive. The team ended up with a problem -- the machine was cheap, but it wasn't a good computer, especially because the 68000 CPU was not powerful enough to display color graphics with acceptable performance. By April 1989, it was decided to split the project into three computers‚Äîthe Macintosh IIsi, which would have the more powerful 68030 CPU; the Macintosh Classic, which would use a black & white display, and the LC, which would use the 68020 CPU from the Macintosh II. The LC family (LC, II, III, 475, Quadra 605) back face To keep the price down, Apple cut some corners on performance and features, and redesigned components to be less expensive. For example, the external floppy connector that was included on the IIsi and Classic was excluded from the LC, as it would save a couple of dollars for the connector. The integrated keyboard had also been dropped by this point; it was replaced with a newly designed keyboard called the Apple Keyboard II. = Market = The Macintosh LC was introduced to the market alongside the Macintosh Classic (a repackaging of the older Macintosh Plus) and the Macintosh IIsi (a new entry-level machine for the Macintosh II series). Due to pent-up demand for a low-cost color Macintosh, the LC was a strong seller, and in 1992, the original Macintosh LC was succeeded by the LC II. The updated machine replaced the LC's Motorola 68020 processor with a 68030 and increased the soldered memory to 4 MB to make it more suitable for System 7. However, it retained the original LC's 16-bit system bus and 10 MB RAM limit (if 4 MB SIMMs was used, the extra 2 MB of RAM would be inaccessible), making its performance roughly the same as the earlier model. The main benefit of the 030 processor in the LC II was the ability to use System 7's virtual memory feature. In spite of this, the new model sold even better than the LC. Computer Gaming World in 1990 criticized the LC as too expensive, stating that consumers would prefer a $2,000 IBM PS/1 with VGA graphics to a $3,000 LC with color monitor. Although the Classic was more popular at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was outselling the Classic (1.2 million). More than half of LCs were used in homes and schools; Apple claimed that it helped the company regain educational market share lost to inexpensive PC clones, with the IIe Card used in about half of schools' LCs. In early 1993, Apple introduced the LC III, which used a 25 MHz version of the 68030 and had a higher memory limit of 36 MB, instead of the 10 MB of the LC and LC II. The LC III spawned a whole series of LC models, most of which later were sold both with the LC name to the education world and to consumers via traditional Apple dealers, and as Performa to the consumer market via electronics stores, and department stores such as Sears. (For example, the LC 475 was also known as the Performa 475.) The last official \\"LC\\" was the Power Macintosh 5300/100 LC, which was released in August 1995 and discontinued in April 1996. The LC 580 was notable for being the last desktop 680x0-based Macintosh. =Expansion to all-in-one market= Side view of an LC II Rear view of an LC II In mid-1993, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC 520, which combined the traditional all-in-one form factor popularized by the compact Macintosh family, with the technology platform of the LC III. It became Apple's mainstream education-market Macintosh, featuring a built-in 14\\" CRT display, CD-ROM drive, and stereo speakers. The case is similar to the recently-introduced Macintosh Color Classic, but considerably larger and heavier due to its larger screen and a bulging midsection to house the larger electronics. Four LC 500-series models were released over the next two years, the 520, 550, 575, and 580, with the 520 and 550 both using different speeds of the Motorola 68030, and the 575 and 580 sharing the 33 MHz Motorola 68LC040 processor but differing on the rest of the hardware. All of these computers were also sold to the consumer market through department stores under the Macintosh Performa brand, with similar model numbers. The LC models, in particular, became very popular in schools for their small footprint, lack of cable clutter, and durability. Apple also released the Macintosh TV, a variant of the LC/Performa 520 that, while not branded as an LC, uses a black-coloured version of the LC 520's case, a logic board similar to the LC 550 and a TV tuner card. The compact Color Classic series shares many components, and is able to swap logic boards, with the early 500 series machines. The Power Macintosh 5200 LC was introduced in April 1995 with a PowerPC 603 CPU at 75 MHz as a PowerPC-based replacement of the LC 500 series. In August, the Power Macintosh 5300 LC was released which kept the same motherboard design but included a more powerful PowerPC 603e CPU, as well as a \\"Director's Edition\\" with similar design and features to the Macintosh TV. Unlike previous education models, which prepended the model number with \\"LC\\", the 5200 / 5300 models use the Power Macintosh designation of Apple's main workstation line of the time, with \\"LC\\" appended to the end. The 5300 LC is the final model branded as an \\"LC\\" and was on sale until early 1997.

As the second-largest canyon in the United States, it is roughly long and has an average width of , but reaches a width of at places. Its depth is around , but in some locations, it increases to . Palo Duro Canyon (from the Spanish meaning \\"hard wood\\" or, more exactly, \\"hard stick\\") has been named \\"The Grand Canyon of Texas\\" both for its size and for its dramatic geological features, including the multicolored layers of rock and steep mesa walls similar to those in the Grand Canyon. Geology Palo Duro Canyon Geologic map The canyon was formed by the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, which initially winds along the level surface of the Llano Estacado of West Texas, then suddenly and dramatically runs off the Caprock Escarpment. Water erosion over the millennia has shaped the canyon's geological formations. Notable canyon formations include caves and hoodoos. One of the best-known and the major signature feature of the canyon is the Lighthouse Rock. A multiple-use, round-trip loop trail is dedicated to the formation. The Lighthouse Palo Duro Canyon was downcut by the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, during the Pleistocene, when the whole region was uplifted.Spearing, Darwin. Roadside Geology of Texas. Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Co., 1991. p. 381 Most of the strata visible in the canyon were deposited during the Permian and Triassic periods. From oldest to youngest, and each separated by an unconformity, the formations are: The Quartermaster Formation is Permian in age, and forms the red, lower slopes of the Canyon. This layer was deposited in a near-shore shallow-marine environment consisting of siltstones and shales with ripple marks and cross bedding, that alternated with dry tidal flats indicated by satin spar gypsum and halite cast evaporite deposits. The red color indicates periods of oxidation.Spearing, pp. 377, 383 The Quartermaster Formation forms the lower wall and canyon floor, averaging in thickness where it outcrops. In particular, this alternating red and white formation forms the steep and gullied lower portion of the north flank of Timber Mesa, with the maroon and lavender smooth slopes of the Tecovas Shale above. The Tecovas Formation is a part of the Dockum Group with the Trujillo Formation. This multicolored Triassic unit consists of shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Deposited in streams and swamps, its colors indicate varying oxidizing conditions, and the alternating dry/wet cycles typical of such environments. These rocks are fossiliferous, containing the remains of phytosaurs, amphibians, and fish,Spearing, 384-5 including Metoposaurus, Desmatosuchus, Koskinonodon, and lungfish, besides coprolites and the petrified wood remains of Araucarioxylon. Septarian calcite concretions and calcite geodes are numerous, and the shale forms the less steep canyon walls covered by talus slopes. A prominent band of jointed white sandstone about thick marks the middle of this formation. Lavender, gray and white shales lie below this sandstone, while an orange shale lies between this sandstone and the Trujillo Formation above. The Quartermaster and Tecovas Formations make up Capital Peak. Likewise, the lower third of Triassic Peak is composed of the deeply furrowed Quartermaster Formation, overlain by the gentle slopes and smooth surface of the Tecovas Formation shales, all capped by the weather- resistant Trujillo Formation sandstone. Large blocks of this sandstone, due to mass wasting, are found along the flanks and base of the peak. The Trujillo Formation is a Triassic formation which is harder than the underlying Tecovas, and forms many of the Canyon's ledges. Composed of coarse sandstone, river cross-bedding indicates deposition in a stream environment. Fossils are rare.Spearing, pp. 384-5 The sandstone has alternating layers of shale and marl-pebble conglomerate. The formation is massively bedded sandstone, making a distinct contact with the underlying Tecovas Formation, forming cliffs, prominent benches and mesas within the canyon. The formation includes a basal, middle and upper sandstone members, separated by shales. The middle sandstone member forms conspicuous ledges and cliffs. Phytosaur and Koskinonodon remains, plus leaf imprints and mineralized wood have been found within the formation. Erosion resistant sandstones protect pedestals of underlying shale, giving rise to hoodoos, including the Lighthouse, and the hoodoo at the south end of Capitol Peak. Likewise, the Rock Garden is composed of Trujillo sandstone boulders. The Ogallala Formation is a late Miocene to early Pliocene unit which forms the cliffs and ledges at the very top of the canyon. Composed of sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate eroded from a late Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains. It is separated from the lower Trujillo Formation by a disconformity, representing a long hiatus. The coarse, porous sedimentary units of the Ogallala Formation constitute the Ogallala Aquifer, which has historically functioned as a major source of drinking water for much of the High Plains.Darton, N.H. 1898. Preliminary report on the geology and water resources of Nebraska west of the one hundred and third meridian. In: Walcott, C.D. (ed), Nineteenth Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey, 1897-1898, Part IV, pp. 719-785.Rex C. Buchanan, B. Brownie Wilson, Robert R. Buddemeier, and James J. Butler, Jr. \\"The High Plains Aquifer\\". Kansas Geological Survey, Public Information Circular (PIC) 18. Fossils of saber- toothed cats (Smilodon), bone-crushing dogs (Borophagus), mastodons, horses, long-necked camels (Aepycamelus), rhinoceroses, and large tortoises up to 3 feet in length, are present in the Ogallala.Spearing, pp. 355-6, 385 The siltstone and sandstone have been cemented by silica, which gives rise to the occurrence of common opal and almost-chert pockets. The upper portion of the formation has thick deposits of caliche, very evident at the Coronado Lodge on the northwest rim of the canyon. Fortress Cliff, on the eastern rim of the canyon, has a spectacular exposure of the Ogallala Formation. Headward erosion by the Prairie Dog Town fork of the Red River, into the caprock escarpment of the Llano Estacado, caused differential erosion. This meant the more resistant Ogallala and Trujillo formations formed the steeper walls of the canyon. History The first evidence of human habitation of the canyon dates back about 10,000-15,000 years, and it is believed to have been continuously inhabited to the present day. Native Americans were attracted to the water of the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, as well as the consequent ample game, edible plants, and protection from the weather the canyon provided. The first European explorers to discover the canyon were members of the Coronado expedition, who visited the canyon in 1541. Apache Indians lived in Palo Duro at the time, but they were later displaced by Comanche and Kiowa tribes, who had the advantage of owning horses brought over by the Spanish. They had contact with traders, called Comancheros, in nearby New Mexico. A United States military team under Captain Randolph B. Marcy mapped the canyon in 1852 during their search for the headwaters of the Red River. The land remained under American Indian control until a military expedition led by Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie was sent in 1874 to remove the Indians to reservations in Oklahoma. The Mackenzie expedition captured about 1,200 of the Indians' horses and slaughtered them in nearby Tule Canyon during the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. The Comanche and Kiowa conceded and left the area. Soon after, in 1876, Charles Goodnight and a wealthy Ulster Scot named John Adair established the JA Ranch in Palo Duro Canyon. Col. Goodnight helped manage the ranch until 1890. Over the next half-century, the canyon remained in private hands but was an increasingly popular tourist spot for local residents. Charles N. Gould made a geologic map of the canyon and named the formations in 1905. In 1931, a major landowner signed a two-year contract with the local chamber of commerce to allow public access to the canyon., Steely, James Wright. Parks for Texas: Enduring Landscapes of the New Deal. Austin: U of Texas, 1999. Print. The upper section of the canyon was purchased by the State of Texas in 1934 and turned into the Palo Duro Canyon State Park. Amarillo is the largest city near Palo Duro Canyon State Park, but the smaller city of Canyon is nearer. In 1976, Palo Duro Canyon State Park was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. Seven units of the Civilian Conservation Corps developed the park from 1933 until 1937. Four groups of veterans, two groups of African Americans, and one junior group, took part in various construction projects, starting with the construction of Park Road 5, a two-lane road from the rim to the floor of the canyon. Other projects included the headquarters building, culverts, low-water crossings, bridges, Spring House, Well House, the Coronado Lodge interpretive center, 4 overnight cabins known as Cow Camp, and the 3 rim cabins. In addition, picnic and camping areas were built, complete with tables, seats, fireplaces and garbage receptacles. The Texas Department of Transportation has built bridges over Water crossings 1, 2, and 6 to allow motorists easier access during and after heavy rains. Paving work has been completed at the Juniper Multi-use Area, with the addition of utilities pending. Campsites and pavilions have also been added, along with several hiking trails.

The battle consisted of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636, near the Yarmouk River, along what are now the borders of Syria‚ÄìJordan and Syria‚ÄìPalestine, east of the Sea of Galilee. The result of the battle was a complete Muslim victory that ended Byzantine rule in Syria. The Battle of Yarmouk is regarded as one of the most decisive battles in military history, and it marked the first great wave of early Muslim conquests after the death of Muhammad, heralding the rapid advance of Islam into the then Christian Levant. To check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius had sent a massive expedition to the Levant in May 636. As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to the Arabian Peninsula, where they were reinforced and defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army. The battle is Khalid ibn al-Walid's greatest military victory and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history. Background In 610, during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, after overthrowing Phocas. Meanwhile, the Sasanian Empire conquered Mesopotamia and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia, occupying Caesarea Mazaca (now Kayseri, Turkey). In 612, Heraclius managed to expel the Persians from Anatolia but was decisively defeated in 613 when he launched a major offensive in Syria against the Persians. Over the following decade, the Persians were able to conquer Palestine and Egypt. Meanwhile, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack and rebuilt his army. In 622, Heraclius finally launched his offensive. After his overwhelming victories over the Persians and their allies in the Caucasus and Armenia, Heraclius launched a winter offensive against the Persians in Mesopotamia in 627, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Nineveh thus threatening the Persian capital city of Ctesiphon. Discredited by the series of disasters, Khosrow II was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II, who immediately sued for peace and agreed to withdraw from all occupied territories of the Byzantine Empire. Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629. Meanwhile, there had been rapid political development in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and, by 630, had successfully annexed most of Arabia under a single political authority. When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was chosen as caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, and several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr, who declared war against the rebels. In what became known as the Ridda wars of 632‚Äì633, Abu Bakr managed to defeat his opponents and unite Arabia under the central authority of the caliph at Medina. Map detailing the Rashidun Caliphate's invasion of the Levant. Once the rebels had been subdued, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest, beginning with Iraq. Sending his most brilliant general, Khalid ibn al-Walid, Iraq was conquered in a series of successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persians. Abu Bakr's confidence grew, and once Khalid established his stronghold in Iraq, Abu Bakr issued a call to arms for the invasion of Syria in February 634. The Muslim invasion of Syria was a series of carefully planned and well-co-ordinated military operations, which employed strategy, instead of pure strength, to deal with the Byzantine defensive measures. The Muslim armies, however, soon proved to be too small to handle the Byzantine response, and their commanders called for reinforcements. Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr from Iraq to Syria with reinforcements and to lead the invasion. In July, the Byzantines were decisively defeated at Ajnadayn. Damascus fell in September, followed by the Battle of Fahl in which the last significant garrison of Palestine was defeated and routed. After Abu Bakr died in 634, his successor, Umar, was determined to continue the Caliphate's expansion deeper into Syria. Though previous campaigns led by Khalid had been successful, he was replaced by Abu Ubaidah. Having secured southern Palestine, Muslim forces now advanced up the trade route, and Tiberias and Baalbek fell without much struggle and conquered Emesa early in 636. The Muslims then continued their conquest across the Levant. Byzantine counterattack Having seized Emesa, the Muslims were just a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his granddaughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what was meant to be a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not co-ordinate with the manoeuvrer, probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government, and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark. Muslim and Byzantine troop movements before the battle of Yarmouk. Modern countries indicated. Byzantine preparations began in late 635 and by May 636 Heraclius had a large force concentrated at Antioch in Northern Syria. The assembled Byzantine army contingents consisted of, Slavs, Franks, Georgians, Armenians and Christian Arabs. The force was organized into five armies, the joint leader of which was Theodore Trithyrius. Vahan, an Armenian and the former garrison commander of Emesa, Bartikyan, Hrach. ¬´’é’°’∞’°’∂¬ª (Vahan). Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. vol. xi. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1985, p. 243. was made the overall field commander, and had under his command a purely Armenian army. Buccinator (Qanatir), a Slavic prince, commanded the Slavs and Jabalah ibn al-Aiham, king of the Ghassanid Arabs, commanded an exclusively Christian Arab force. The remaining contingents, all European, were placed under Gregory and Dairjan. Heraclius himself supervised the operation from Antioch. Byzantine sources mention Niketas, son of the Persian general Shahrbaraz, among the commanders, but it is not certain which army he commanded. The Rashidun army was then split into four groups: one under Amr in Palestine, one under Shurahbil in Jordan, one under Yazid in the Damascus-Caesarea region and the last one under Abu Ubaidah along with Khalid at Emesa. As the Muslim forces were geographically divided, Heraclius sought to exploit that situation and planned to attack. He did not wish to engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the Muslims to retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would fulfil his strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius' son Constantine III, probably to tie down Yazid's forces, which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria in the middle of June 636. The Byzantine imperial army was to operate under the following plan: * Jabalah's lightly armed Christian Arabs would march to Emesa from Aleppo via Hama and hold the main Muslim army at Emesa. * Dairjan would make a flanking movement between the coast and Aleppo's road and approach Emesa from the west, striking at the Muslims' left flank while they were being held frontally by Jabalah. * Gregory would strike the Muslims' right flank, approaching Emesa from the northeast via Mesopotamia. * Qanatir would march along the coastal route and occupy Beirut, from where he was to attack the weakly defended Damascus from the west to cut off the main Muslim army at Emesa. * Vahan's corps would act as a reserve and would approach Emesa via Hama. Muslim strategy The Muslims discovered Heraclius' preparations at Shaizar through Byzantine prisoners. Alert to the possibility of being caught with separated forces, which could be destroyed, Khalid called for a council of war and advised Abu Ubaidah to pull the troops back from Palestine and Northern and Central Syria and then to concentrate the entire Rashidun army in one place. Abu Ubaidah ordered the concentration of troops in the vast plain near Jabiyah, as control of the area made cavalry charges possible and facilitated the arrival of reinforcements from Umar so that a strong, united force could be fielded against the Byzantine armies. The position also benefited from close proximity to the Rashidun stronghold of Najd, in case of retreat. Instructions were also issued to return the jizya (tribute) to the people who had paid it. However, once concentrated at Jabiyah, the Muslims were subject to raids from pro-Byzantine Ghassanid forces. Encamping in the region was also precarious as a strong Byzantine force was garrisoned in Caeseara and could attack the Muslim rear while they were held in front by the Byzantine army. On Khalid's advice the Muslim forces retreated to Dara‚Äôah (or Dara) and Dayr Ayyub, covering the gap between the Yarmouk Gorges and the Harra lava plains, and established a line of camps in the eastern part of the plain of Yarmouk. That was a strong defensive position, and the manoeuvrers pitted the Muslims and Byzantines into a decisive battle, which the latter had tried to avoid. During the maneuvers, there were no engagements except for a minor skirmish between Khalid's elite light cavalry and the Byzantine advance guard. Battlefield Across the ravines lies the battlefield of Yarmouk, about 8 miles away from here, in Jordan. Map detailing where the battle took place. The battlefield lies in the plain of Jordanian Hauran, just southeast of the Golan Heights, an upland region currently on the frontier between Jordan and Syria, east of the Sea of Galilee. The battle was fought on the plain south of Yarmouk River. That ravine joins the Yarmouk River, a tributary of the Jordan River, on its south. The stream had very steep banks, ranging from ‚Äì in height. On the north is the Jabiyah road and to the east are the Azra hills although the hills were outside the actual field of battle. Strategically, there was only one prominence in the battlefield: a elevation known as Tel al Jumm'a, and for the Muslim troops concentrated there, the hill gave a good view of the plain of Yarmouk. The ravine on the west of the battlefield was accessible at a few places in 636 AD, and had one main crossing: a Roman bridge (Jisr-ur-Ruqqad) near 'Ain Dhakar Logistically, the Yarmouk plain had enough water supplies and pastures to sustain both armies. The plain was excellent for cavalry manoeuvrers. Troop deployment Most early accounts place the size of the Muslim forces between 24,000 and 40,000 and the number of Byzantine forces between 100,000 and 400,000. Modern estimates for the sizes of the respective armies vary: the vast majority of estimates for the Byzantine army are between 80,000 and 150,000, while other estimates are as low as 15,000 to 20,000.John Haldon (2013) Estimates for the Rashidun army are between 25,000 and 40,000. Original accounts are mostly from Arab sources, generally agreeing that the Byzantine army and their allies outnumbered the Muslim Arabs by a sizeable margin. The only early Byzantine source is Theophanes, who wrote a century later. Accounts of the battle vary, some stating it lasted a day, others more than a day. =Rashidun army= During a council of war, the command of the Muslim army was transferred to Khalid by Abu Ubaidah, Commander in Chief of the Muslim army. After taking command, Khalid reorganized the army into 36 infantry regiments and four cavalry regiments, with his cavalry elite, the mobile guard, held in reserve. The army was organised in the Tabi'a formation, a tight, defensive infantry formation. The army was lined up on a front of , facing west, with its left flank lying south on the Yarmouk River a mile before the ravines of Wadi al Allan began. The army's right flank was on the Jabiyah road in the north across the heights of Tel al Jumm'a, with substantial gaps between the divisions so that their frontage would match that of the Byzantine battle line at . The centre of the army was under the command of Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah (left centre) and Shurahbil bin Hasana (right centre). The left wing was under the command of Yazid and the right wing was under Amr ibn al-A'as. The centre, left and right wings were given cavalry regiments, to be used as a reserve for counterattack if they were pushed back by the Byzantines. Behind the centre stood the mobile guard under the personal command of Khalid. If Khalid was too occupied in leading the general army, Dharar ibn al-Azwar would command the mobile guard. Over the course of the battle, Khalid would repeatedly make critical and decisive use of that mounted reserve. Khalid sent out several scouts to keep the Byzantines under observation. In late July, Vahan sent Jabalah with his lightly armoured Christian-Arab forces to reconnoiter-in-force, but they were repulsed by the mobile guard. After the skirmish, no engagement occurred for a month. Weaponry Helmets used included gilded helmets similar to the silver helmets of the Sassanid empire. Mail was commonly used to protect the face, neck, and cheeks as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif. Heavy leather sandals as well as Roman-type sandal boots were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers. Armour included hardened leather scale or lamellar armour and mail armour. Infantry soldiers were more heavily armoured than horsemen. Large wooden or wickerwork shields were used. Long-shafted spears were used, with infantry spears being long and cavalry spears being up to long. Short infantry swords like the Roman gladius and Sassanid long swords were used; long swords were usually carried by horsemen. Swords were hung in baldrics. Bows were about long when unbraced, similar in size to the famous English longbow. The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow was about . Early Muslim archers, while being infantry archers without the mobility of horseback archer regiments, proved to be very effective in defending against light and unarmoured cavalry attacks. =Byzantine army= A few days after the Muslims encamped at the Yarmouk plain, the Byzantine army, preceded by the lightly armed Ghassanids of Jabalah, moved forward and established strongly fortified camps just north of the Wadi-ur-Ruqqad. The right flank of the Byzantine army was at the south end of the plains, near the Yarmouk River and about a mile before the ravines of Wadi al Allan began. The left flank of the Byzantines was at the north, a short distance before the Hills of Jabiyah began, and was relatively exposed. Vahan deployed the Imperial Army facing east, with a front about long, as he was trying to cover the whole area between the Yarmouk gorge in the south and the Roman road to Egypt in the north, and substantial gaps had been left between the Byzantine divisions. The right wing was commanded by Gregory and the left by Qanatir. The centre was formed by the army of Dairjan and the Armenian army of Vahan, both under the overall command of Dairjan. The Byzantine regular heavy cavalry, the cataphract, was distributed equally among the four armies, each army deploying its infantry at the forefront and its cavalry as a reserve in the rear. Vahan deployed Jabalah's Christian Arabs, mounted on horses and camels, as a skirmishing force, screening the main army until its arrival. Early Muslim sources mention that the army of Gregory had used chains to link together its foot soldiers, who had all taken an oath of death. The chains were in 10-man lengths as a proof of unshakeable courage on the part of the men, who thus displayed their willingness to die where they stood and not to retreat. The chains also acted as an insurance against a breakthrough by enemy cavalry. However, modern historians suggest that the Byzantines adopted the Graeco-Roman testudo military formation in which soldiers would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with shields held high and an arrangement of 10 to 20 men would be completely shielded on all sides from missile fire, each soldier providing cover for an adjoining companion. Weaponry The Byzantine cavalry was armed with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the shoulder across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armour consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant: a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armour. Light lamellar and scale armour was also used. Tensions in Byzantine army Khalid's strategy of withdrawing from the occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared. Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end and there was a decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command not to engage in large- scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan had little choice but to respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of the feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat. Battle The battle lines of the Muslims and the Byzantines were divided into four sections: the left wing, the left centre, the right centre and the right wing. Note that the descriptions of the Muslim and the Byzantine battle lines are exactly each other's opposite: the Muslim right wing faced the Byzantine left wing (see image). thumbrightalt=map detailing the respective troop deployment before the battle.Troop deployment. Vahan was instructed by Heraclius not to engage in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored., probably because Yazdegerd III's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, but their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, with a similar end. The negotiations delayed the battles for a month. On the other hand, Umar, whose forces at Qadisiyah were threatened with confronting the Sassanid armies, ordered Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas to enter negotiations with the Persians and to send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and his commander Rostam FarrokhzƒÅd, apparently inviting them to Islam. That was most probably the delaying tactic employed by Umar on the Persian front. Meanwhile, he sent reinforcements of 6,000 troops, mostly from Yemen, to Khalid. The force included 1,000 Sahaba (companions of Muhammad), among whom were 100 veterans of the Battle of Badr, the first battle in Islamic history, and included citizens of the highest rank, such as Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Abu Sufyan, and his wife Hind bint Utbah. Also present were such distinct companions as Sa'id ibn Zayd, Fadl ibn Abbas, Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr (the son of Abu Bakr), Abdullah ibn Umar (the son of Umar), Aban ibn Uthman (the son of Uthman), Abdulreman ibn Khalid (the son of Khalid), Abdullah ibn Ja'far (the nephew of Ali), Ammar ibn Yasir, Miqdad ibn Aswad, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, Malik al-Ashtar, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, Qays ibn Sa'd, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, Ubada ibn as-Samit, Hisham ibn al-A'as, Abu Huraira and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. As it was a citizen army, in contrast to a mercenary army, the age of the soldiers ranged from 20 (in the case of Khalid's son) to 70 (in the case of Ammar). Three of the ten companions promised paradise by Muhammad, namely Sa'id, Zubayr and Abu Ubaidah, were present at Yarmouk. Umar, apparently wanting to defeat the Byzantines first, used the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided that they had no choice but to attack. The reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements to demoralize the Byzantines to compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah. =Day 1= Day 1, limited attacks by the Byzantine army The battle began on 15 August. At dawn, both armies lined up for battle less than a mile apart. It is recorded in Muslim chronicles that before the battle started, George, a unit commander in the Byzantine right centre, rode up to the Muslim line and converted to Islam; he would die the same day fighting on the Muslim side. The battle began as the Byzantine army sent its champions to duel with the Muslim mubarizun. The mubarizun were specially trained swordsmen and lancers, with the objective to slay as many enemy commanders as possible to damage their morale. At midday, after losing a number of commanders in the duels, Vahan ordered a limited attack with a third of his infantry forces to test the strength and strategy of the Muslim army and, using their overwhelming numerical and weaponry superiority, achieve a breakthrough wherever the Muslim battle line was weak. However the Byzantine assault lacked determination; many Byzantine soldiers were unable to press the attack against the Muslim veterans. The fighting was generally moderate although in some places, it was especially intense. Vahan did not reinforce his forward infantry, two thirds of which was kept in reserve with one third deployed to engage the Muslims, and at sunset, both armies broke contact and returned to their respective camps. =Day 2= Day 2, Phase 1. Day 2, Phase 2. Day 2, Phase 3. _Phase 1:_ On 16 August, Vahan decided in a council of war to launch his attack just before dawn, to catch the Muslim force unprepared as they conducted their morning prayers. He planned to engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre in an effort to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army, which would then be driven away from the battlefield or pushed towards the centre. To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack. However, Khalid had prepared for such a contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims time to prepare for battle. At the centre, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and preventing them from aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the centre remained stable, but on the wings the situation was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank, which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp. _Phase 2:_ Khalid, aware of the situation at the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of the Byzantine left wing, and the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front. The three- pronged attack forced the Byzantine left wing to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round. The situation on the Muslim left wing, which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. The Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard but not the left wing, and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. There, the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defence. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps and for a moment Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken though morale was severely damaged. The retreating Muslim army was met by the ferocious Arab women in the camps. Led by Hind, the Muslim women dismantled their tents, and armed with tent poles, charged at their husbands and fellow men singing an improvised song from the Battle of Uhud, which then had been directed against the Muslims. That boiled the blood of the retreating Muslims so much that they returned to the battlefield. _Phase 3:_ After managing to stabilize the position on the right flank, Khalid ordered the mobile guard cavalry to provide relief to the battered left flank. Khalid detached one regiment under Dharar ibn al-Azwar and ordered him to attack the front of the army of Dairjan (left centre) to create a diversion and threaten the withdrawal of the Byzantine right wing from its advanced position. With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation. At sunset, the central armies broke contact and withdrew to their original positions and both fronts were restored along the lines occupied in the morning. The death of Dairjan and the failure of Vahan's battle plan left the larger Imperial army relatively demoralized, but Khalid's successful counterattacks emboldened his troops despite their being smaller in number. =Day 3= Day 3, Phase 1. Day 3, Phase 2. On 17 August, Vahan pondered over his failures and mistakes of the previous day, where he launched attacks against respective Muslim flanks, but after initial success, his men were pushed back. What bothered him the most was the loss of one of his commanders. The Byzantine army decided on a less ambitious plan, and Vahan now aimed to break the Muslim army at specific points. He decided to press upon the relatively exposed right flank, where his mounted troops could manoeuvrer more freely as compared to the rugged terrain at the Muslims' left flank. The junction was to be between the Muslim right centre, its right wing held by Qanatir's Slavs, to break them apart so that they would be fought separately. _Phase 1:_ The battle resumed with Byzantine attacks on the Muslim right flank and right centre. After holding off the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, followed by the right centre. They were again said to have been met by their own women, who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize some distance from the camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack. _Phase 2:_ Knowing that the Byzantine army was focusing on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left centre, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right centre struck at the Byzantines left centre at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right-wing cavalry to strike at the left flank of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk, the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had at the start of the battle. =Day 4= The fourth day was to prove decisive. Day 4, Phase 1. Day 4, Phase 2. _Phase 1:_ Vahan decided to persist with the previous day's war plan as he had been successful in inflicting damage on the Muslim right. Qanatir led two armies of Slavs against the Muslim right wing and right centre with some assistance from the Armenians and Christian Arabs led by Jabalah. The Muslim right wing and right centre again fell back. Khalid entered the fray yet again with the mobile guard. He feared a general attack on a broad front, which he would be unable to repulse, and so ordered Abu Ubaidah and Yazid on the left centre and the left wings, respectively, to attack the Byzantine armies at the respective fronts. The attack would result in stalling the Byzantine front and prevent a general advance of the Imperial army. _Phase 2:_ Khalid divided his mobile guard into two divisions and attacked the flanks of the Byzantine left centre, and the infantry of the Muslim right centre attacked from the front. Under the three-pronged flanking manoeuvre, the Byzantines fell back. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking from the front and the cavalry reserve attacking the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing. As the Byzantine left centre retreated under three-pronged attacks of Khalid, the Byzantine left wing, having been exposed at its southern flank, also fell back. While Khalid and his mobile guard were dealing with the Armenian front throughout the afternoon, the situation on the other end was worsening. Byzantine horse- archers had taken to the field and subjected Abu Ubaidah and Yazid's troops to intense archery preventing them from penetrating their Byzantine lines. Many Muslim soldiers lost their sight to Byzantine arrows on that day, which thereafter became known as the \\"Day of Lost Eyes\\". The veteran Abu Sufyan is also believed to have lost an eye that day. The Muslim armies fell back except for one regiment, led by Ikrimah bin Abi Jahal, which was on the left of Abu Ubaidah's corps. Ikrimah covered the retreat of the Muslims with his 400 members of the cavalry by attacking the Byzantine front, and the other armies reorganized themselves to counterattack and regain their lost positions. All of Ikrimah's men were either seriously injured or dead that day. Ikrimah, a childhood friend of Khalid, was mortally wounded and died later in the evening. =Day 5= Deployment of troops on the fifth day. Khalid gathered all his cavalry for a decisive flanking charge. During the four-day offence of Vahan, his troops had failed to achieve any breakthrough and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard's flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce for the next few days so that fresh negotiations could be held. He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops, but Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer. Until now, the Muslim army had adopted a largely defensive strategy, but knowing that the Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now decided to take the offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total strength of the cavalry group was now about 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, Wadi-ur-Ruqqad at west, Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry. There were however, some passages across the deep ravines of Wadi-ur-Raqqad in west, strategically the most important one was at Ayn al Dhakar, a bridge. Khalid sent Dharar with 500 cavalry at night to secure that bridge. Dharar moved around the northern flank of Byzantines and captured the bridge, a manoeuvrer that was to prove decisive the next day. =Day 6= Day 6, Phase 1. Day 6, Phase 2. Day 6, Phase 3. Day 6, The last phase. On 20 August, Khalid put into action a simple but bold plan of attack. With his massed cavalry force, he intended to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial army, would be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear. At the same time, he planned to push a determined attack to turn the left flank of the Byzantine army and drive them towards the ravine to the west. _Phase 1:_ Khalid ordered a general attack on the Byzantine front and galloped his cavalry around the left wing of the Byzantines. Part of his cavalry engaged the Byzantine left wing cavalry while the rest of it attacked the rear of the Byzantine left wing infantry. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing pressed against it from the front. Under the two-pronged attack, the Byzantine left wing fell back and collapsed and fell back to the Byzantine left centre, greatly disordering it. The remaining Muslim cavalry then attacked the Byzantine left wing cavalry at the rear while they were held frontally by the other half of the Muslim cavalry, routing them off the battlefield to the north. The Muslim right-wing infantry now attacked the Byzantine left centre at its left flank while the Muslim right centre attacked from front. _Phase 2:_ Vahan, noticing the huge cavalry manoeuvrer of the Muslims, ordered his cavalry to group together, but was not quick enough. Before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons, Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons, falling upon them from the front and the flank while they were still moving into formation. The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate. _Phase 3:_ With the Byzantine cavalry completely routed, Khalid turned to the Byzantine left centre, which already held the two-pronged attack of the Muslim infantry. The Byzantine left centre was attacked at its rear by Khalid's cavalry and was finally broken. _Phase 4:_ With the retreat of the Byzantine left centre, a general Byzantine retreat started. Khalid took his cavalry north to block the northern route of escape. The Byzantines retreated west towards Wadi-ur-Ruqqad, where there was a bridge at Ayn al Dhakar for safe crossing across the deep gorges of the ravines of Wadi-ur-Ruqqad. Dharar had already captured the bridge as part of Khalid's plan the night before. A unit of 500 mounted troops had been sent to block the passageway. In fact, that was the route by which Khalid wanted the Byzantines to retreat all along. The Byzantines were surrounded from all sides now. Some fell into the deep ravines off the steep slopes, others tried to escape in the waters but were smashed on the rocks below and still others were killed in their flight. Nevertheless, many of the soldiers managed to escape the slaughter. Jonah, the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus, died in the battle. The Muslims took no prisoners in the battle, but they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit. Theodore Trithurios died on the battlefield, and Niketas managed to escape and reach Emesa. Jabalah ibn al- Ayham also managed to escape and later briefly came to terms with the Muslims, but he soon defected to the Byzantine court again. Aftermath Immediately after the operation was over, Khalid and his mobile guard moved north to pursue the retreating Byzantine soldiers and found them near Damascus and attacked. Vahan, who had escaped the fate of most of his men at Yarmouk, was probably killed in the ensuing fighting. Khalid then entered Damascus, where he was welcomed by the local residents, thus recapturing the city. When news of the disaster reached Heraclius at Antioch, the emperor was devastated and enraged. He blamed his wrongdoings for the loss, primarily referring to his incestuous marriage to his niece Martina. He would have tried to reconquer the province if he had the resources but now had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead, he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously and accepted the fact that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins of the people of the land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night. His ship supposedly set sail, and he bade a last farewell to Syria,: Farewell, a long farewell to Syria, my fair province. Thou art an infidel's (enemy's) now. Peace be with you, O Syria‚Äîwhat a beautiful land you will be for the enemy. Heraclius abandoned Syria with the holy relic of the True Cross, which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, just to protect it from the invading Arabs. It is said that he had a fear of water, and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, he began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638‚Äì39, and Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated. In 639‚Äì642 Muslims invaded and captured Byzantine Egypt, led by Amr ibn al-A'as, who had commanded the right flank of the Rashidun army at Yarmouk. Evaluation The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed their enemy to have the battlefield of his choosing. Even then, they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew all along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until the last day of the battle, conducted an essentially defensive campaign, suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a smaller force and needed all the men he could muster, he had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat that he had anticipated for the enemy army. Because of his leadership at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid is considered one of the finest generals in history, and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changed the course of events wherever they appeared, and, then just as quickly, galloped away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field. Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did not manage to deal with the mounted force and use the sizable advantage of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never played a significant role in the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks, and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, but that may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, but the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops. The original strategy of Heraclius, to destroy the Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed those qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmouk, Khalid carried out, on a small tactical scale, what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale. By rapidly deploying and manoeuvring his forces, Khalid was able to concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field temporarily to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan was never able to make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the terrain, which prevented large-scale deployment. However, Vahan never attempted to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive five out of the six days, his battle line remained remarkably static. That stands in stark contrast to the very successful offensive plan, which Khalid carried out on the final by reorganising virtually all his cavalry and committing it to a grand manoeuvre, which won the battle.

Reuse A postage stamp is a small required piece of paper attached to mail that indicates that the postage (the cost of sending the mail) has been paid. Because stamps are sent on most mail, the stamp on a received item can be removed and placed on a different piece of mail to be sent, thus reusing the stamp without paying the proper postage. In many countries, such as the United States, reuse of used stamps, whether cancelled or not, is illegal. Prevention =Mute cancellation (killer)= After use, many stamps are marked by a cancellation by the postal system, which defaces the stamp and prevents its reuse. The cancellation usually includes a killer placed on the stamp that has black bars, cork impressions or other obstructive shapes to deface the stamp. Instead of using an entirely separate mark, some countries use their postmark, placed on the stamp, to cancel mail. Rare mute cancellation in the Austrian empire 1850 issue =Grilling= In the United States, the experiment of grilling was tried in 1867, where tiny squares were embossed into the paper after the stamp was printed, the idea being that this would break up the paper fibers and let more ink be absorbed into the paper. But this also made the stamps more prone to tearing, and grilling was abandoned around 1871. The more unusual types of grills are now among the great rarities of US stamps. =Design with water-soluble inks= In Great Britain, the 1880s saw the use of inks which were water-soluble, thus preventing washing altogether. Only lilac and green colors were available. This scheme was abandoned after a few years, and the few surviving unwashed stamps have become collectibles. =Surface coating= Later experiments involved surface coatings. Between 1901 and 1907 Austria applied varnish bars, thin diagonal strips of varnish, to the paper before printing the design. Russia did the same between 1909 and 1915, applying the varnish in a pattern of lozenges. In both cases the (not very convincing) theory was the same; the ink of the printed design would not soak into the varnish, so that in the washing process the design would tend to flake off, forming a telltale pattern on the washed stamp. The United States also coated a few of their $1 revenue stamps with varnish around the turn of the 20th century. =Perfin= A perfin is a stamp that has had initials or a name perforated across it to discourage theft. By agreement with postal authorities, a perfin stamp on a letter could be used only by the owner of the perfin. Therefore, a stolen perforated stamp would be of no value to the unauthorized bearer. =Varia= More unusual methods have included tearing or slicing the stamp, but this is a slower process and can easily damage the contents, and was only occasionally used. An example is 19th-century Afghanistan, where cancellation involved the removal of part of the stamp rather than applying ink or other surface marking.

The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century, by Isaac Newton, as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since reflecting telescopes use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a \\"catoptric\\" telescope. From the time of Newton to the 1800s, the mirror itself was made of metal usually speculum metal. This type included Newton's first designs and even the largest telescopes of the 19th century, the Leviathan of Parsonstown with a 1.8 meter wide metal mirror. In the 19th century a new method using a block of glass coated with very thin layer of silver began to become more popular by the turn of the century. A major turning point in reflecting telescopes was the Paris Observatory 1.2 m of 1878, A.A. Common telescopes which led to the Crossley and Harvard reflecting telescopes, which helped establish a better reputation for reflecting telescopes as the metal mirror designs were noted for their drawbacks. Chiefly the metal mirrors only reflected about 2/3 of the light and the metal would tarnish. After multiple polishings and tarnishings the mirror could lose its precise figuring needed. Reflecting telescopes became extraordinarily popular for astronomy and many famous telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope and popular amateur models use this design. In addition, the reflection telescope principle was applied to other wavelengths of light, and for example, X-Ray telescopes also use the reflection principle to make image forming optics. History A replica of Newton's second reflecting telescope that he presented to the Royal Society in 1672 The great telescope of Birr, the Leviathan of Parsonstown. Modern day remnants of the mirror and support structure. The idea that curved mirrors behave like lenses dates back at least to Alhazen's 11th century treatise on optics, works that had been widely disseminated in Latin translations in early modern Europe. Soon after the invention of the refracting telescope, Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge of the principles of curved mirrors, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. There were reports that the Bolognese Cesare Caravaggi had constructed one around 1626 and the Italian professor Niccol√≤ Zucchi, in a later work, wrote that he had experimented with a concave bronze mirror in 1616, but said it did not produce a satisfactory image. The potential advantages of using parabolic mirrors, primarily reduction of spherical aberration with no chromatic aberration, led to many proposed designs for reflecting telescopes.theoretical designs by Bonaventura Cavalieri, Marin Mersenne, and Gregory among others The most notable being James Gregory, who published an innovative design for a ‚Äòreflecting‚Äô telescope in 1663. It would be ten years (1673), before the experimental scientist Robert Hooke was able to build this type of telescope, which became known as the Gregorian telescope. Isaac Newton has been generally credited with building the first reflecting telescope in 1668. It used a spherically ground metal primary mirror and a small diagonal mirror in an optical configuration that has come to be known as the Newtonian telescope. Despite the theoretical advantages of the reflector design, the difficulty of construction and the poor performance of the speculum metal mirrors being used at the time meant it took over 100 years for them to become popular. Many of the advances in reflecting telescopes included the perfection of parabolic mirror fabrication in the 18th century,Parabolic mirrors were used much earlier, but James Short perfected their construction. See silver coated glass mirrors in the 19th century, long-lasting aluminum coatings in the 20th century,Silvering on a reflecting telescope was introduced by L√©on Foucault in 1857, see madehow.com - Inventor Biographies - Jean-Bernard-L√©on Foucault Biography (1819‚Äì1868), and the adoption of long lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932. Bakich sample pages Chapter 2, Page 3 \\"John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, was one of the first to coat a mirror with aluminum. He did it by thermal vacuum evaporation. The first mirror he aluminized, in 1932, is the earliest known example of a telescope mirror coated by this technique.\\" segmented mirrors to allow larger diameters, and active optics to compensate for gravitational deformation. A mid-20th century innovation was catadioptric telescopes such as the Schmidt camera, which use both a spherical mirror and a lens (called a corrector plate) as primary optical elements, mainly used for wide-field imaging without spherical aberration. The late 20th century has seen the development of adaptive optics and lucky imaging to overcome the problems of seeing, and reflecting telescopes are ubiquitous on space telescopes and many types of spacecraft imaging devices. Technical considerations Gran Telescopio Canarias A curved primary mirror is the reflector telescope's basic optical element that creates an image at the focal plane. The distance from the mirror to the focal plane is called the focal length. Film or a digital sensor may be located here to record the image, or a secondary mirror may be added to modify the optical characteristics and/or redirect the light to film, digital sensors, or an eyepiece for visual observation. The primary mirror in most modern telescopes is composed of a solid glass cylinder whose front surface has been ground to a spherical or parabolic shape. A thin layer of aluminum is vacuum deposited onto the mirror, forming a highly reflective first surface mirror. Some telescopes use primary mirrors which are made differently. Molten glass is rotated to make its surface paraboloidal, and is kept rotating while it cools and solidifies. (See Rotating furnace.) The resulting mirror shape approximates a desired paraboloid shape that requires minimal grinding and polishing to reach the exact figure needed. =Optical errors= Reflecting telescopes, just like any other optical system, do not produce \\"perfect\\" images. The need to image objects at distances up to infinity, view them at different wavelengths of light, along with the requirement to have some way to view the image the primary mirror produces, means there is always some compromise in a reflecting telescope's optical design. An image of Sirius A and Sirius B by the Hubble Space Telescope, showing diffraction spikes and concentric diffraction rings. Because the primary mirror focuses light to a common point in front of its own reflecting surface almost all reflecting telescope designs have a secondary mirror, film holder, or detector near that focal point partially obstructing the light from reaching the primary mirror. Not only does this cause some reduction in the amount of light the system collects, it also causes a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction as well as diffraction spikes caused by most secondary support structures.Rodger W. Gordon, \\"Central Obstructions and their effect on image contrast\\" brayebrookobservatory.org\\"Obstruction\\" in optical instruments The use of mirrors avoids chromatic aberration but they produce other types of aberrations. A simple spherical mirror cannot bring light from a distant object to a common focus since the reflection of light rays striking the mirror near its edge do not converge with those that reflect from nearer the center of the mirror, a defect called spherical aberration. To avoid this problem most reflecting telescopes use parabolic shaped mirrors, a shape that can focus all the light to a common focus. Parabolic mirrors work well with objects near the center of the image they produce, (light traveling parallel to the mirror's optical axis), but towards the edge of that same field of view they suffer from off axis aberrations:Richard Fitzpatrick, Spherical Mirrors, farside.ph.utexas.eduVik Dhillon, reflectors, vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk * Coma ‚Äì an aberration where point sources (stars) at the center of the image are focused to a point but typically appears as \\"comet-like\\" radial smudges that get worse towards the edges of the image. * Field curvature ‚Äì The best image plane is in general curved, which may not correspond to the detector's shape and leads to a focus error across the field. It is sometimes corrected by a field flattening lens. * Astigmatism ‚Äì an azimuthal variation of focus around the aperture causing point source images off-axis to appear elliptical. Astigmatism is not usually a problem in a narrow field of view, but in a wide field image it gets rapidly worse and varies quadratically with field angle. * Distortion ‚Äì Distortion does not affect image quality (sharpness) but does affect object shapes. It is sometimes corrected by image processing. There are reflecting telescope designs that use modified mirror surfaces (such as the Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescope) or some form of correcting lens (such as catadioptric telescopes) that correct some of these aberrations. Use in astronomical research Goddard Space Flight Center, May 2016. Nearly all large research-grade astronomical telescopes are reflectors. There are several reasons for this: * Reflectors work in a wider spectrum of light since certain wavelengths are absorbed when passing through glass elements like those found in a refractor or in a catadioptric telescope. * In a lens the entire volume of material has to be free of imperfection and inhomogeneities, whereas in a mirror, only one surface has to be perfectly polished. * Light of different wavelengths travels through a medium other than vacuum at different speeds. This causes chromatic aberration. Reducing this to acceptable levels usually involves a combination of two or three aperture sized lenses (see achromat and apochromat for more details). The cost of such systems therefore scales significantly with aperture size. An image obtained from a mirror does not suffer from chromatic aberration to begin with, and the cost of the mirror scales much more modestly with its size. * There are structural problems involved in manufacturing and manipulating large-aperture lenses. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces. The largest practical lens size in a refracting telescope is around 1 meter. In contrast, a mirror can be supported by the whole side opposite its reflecting face, allowing for reflecting telescope designs that can overcome gravitational sag. The largest reflector designs currently exceed 10 meters in diameter.  Reflecting telescope designs  =Gregorian= Light path in a Gregorian telescope. The Gregorian telescope, described by Scottish astronomer and mathematician James Gregory in his 1663 book Optica Promota, employs a concave secondary mirror that reflects the image back through a hole in the primary mirror. This produces an upright image, useful for terrestrial observations. Some small spotting scopes are still built this way. There are several large modern telescopes that use a Gregorian configuration such as the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, the Magellan telescopes, the Large Binocular Telescope, and the Giant Magellan Telescope. =Newtonian= Light path in a Newtonian telescope. The Newtonian telescope was the first successful reflecting telescope, completed by Isaac Newton in 1668. It usually has a paraboloid primary mirror but at focal ratios of f/8 or longer a spherical primary mirror can be sufficient for high visual resolution. A flat secondary mirror reflects the light to a focal plane at the side of the top of the telescope tube. It is one of the simplest and least expensive designs for a given size of primary, and is popular with amateur telescope makers as a home-build project. =The Cassegrain design and its variations= Light path in a Cassegrain telescope. The cassegrain telescope (sometimes called the \\"Classic Cassegrain\\") was first published in a 1672 design attributed to Laurent Cassegrain. It has a parabolic primary mirror, and a hyperbolic secondary mirror that reflects the light back down through a hole in the primary. The folding and diverging effect of the secondary mirror creates a telescope with a long focal length while having a short tube length. Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien The Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescope, invented by George Willis Ritchey and Henri Chr√©tien in the early 1910s, is a specialized Cassegrain reflector which has two hyperbolic mirrors (instead of a parabolic primary). It is free of coma and spherical aberration at a nearly flat focal plane if the primary and secondary curvature are properly figured, making it well suited for wide field and photographic observations. Almost every professional reflector telescope in the world is of the Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien design. Three-mirror anastigmat Including a third curved mirror allows correction of the remaining distortion, astigmatism, from the Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien design. This allows much larger fields of view. Dall‚ÄìKirkham The Dall‚ÄìKirkham Cassegrain telescope's design was created by Horace Dall in 1928 and took on the name in an article published in Scientific American in 1930 following discussion between amateur astronomer Allan Kirkham and Albert G. Ingalls, the magazine editor at the time. It uses a concave elliptical primary mirror and a convex spherical secondary. While this system is easier to grind than a classic Cassegrain or Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien system, it does not correct for off- axis coma. Field curvature is actually less than a classical Cassegrain. Because this is less noticeable at longer focal ratios, Dall‚ÄìKirkhams are seldom faster than f/15. =Off-axis designs= There are several designs that try to avoid obstructing the incoming light by eliminating the secondary or moving any secondary element off the primary mirror's optical axis, commonly called off-axis optical systems.  Herschelian  The Herschelian reflector is named after William Herschel, who used this design to build very large telescopes including the 40-foot telescope in 1789. In the Herschelian reflector the primary mirror is tilted so the observer's head does not block the incoming light. Although this introduces geometrical aberrations, Herschel employed this design to avoid the use of a Newtonian secondary mirror since the speculum metal mirrors of that time tarnished quickly and could only achieve 60% reflectivity.catalogue.museogalileo.it - Institute and Museum of the History of Science - Florence, Italy, Telescope, glossary Schiefspiegler A variant of the Cassegrain, the Schiefspiegler telescope (\\"skewed\\" or \\"oblique reflector\\") uses tilted mirrors to avoid the secondary mirror casting a shadow on the primary. However, while eliminating diffraction patterns this leads to an increase in coma and astigmatism. These defects become manageable at large focal ratios ‚Äî most Schiefspieglers use f/15 or longer, which tends to restrict useful observation to the Moon and planets. A number of variations are common, with varying numbers of mirrors of different types. The Kutter (named after its inventor Anton Kutter) style uses a single concave primary, a convex secondary and a plano-convex lens between the secondary mirror and the focal plane, when needed (this is the case of the catadioptric Schiefspiegler). One variation of a multi-schiefspiegler uses a concave primary, convex secondary and a parabolic tertiary. One of the interesting aspects of some Schiefspieglers is that one of the mirrors can be involved in the light path twice ‚Äî each light path reflects along a different meridional path. Stevick-Paul Stevick-Paul telescopesStevick-Paul Telescopes by Dave Stevick are off-axis versions of Paul 3-mirror systems with an added flat diagonal mirror. A convex secondary mirror is placed just to the side of the light entering the telescope, and positioned afocally so as to send parallel light on to the tertiary. The concave tertiary mirror is positioned exactly twice as far to the side of the entering beam as was the convex secondary, and its own radius of curvature distant from the secondary. Because the tertiary mirror receives parallel light from the secondary, it forms an image at its focus. The focal plane lies within the system of mirrors, but is accessible to the eye with the inclusion of a flat diagonal. The Stevick-Paul configuration results in all optical aberrations totaling zero to the third-order, except for the Petzval surface which is gently curved. Yolo The Yolo was developed by Arthur S. Leonard in the mid-1960s.Arthur S. Leonard THE YOLO REFLECTOR Like the Schiefspiegler, it is an unobstructed, tilted reflector telescope. The original Yolo consists of a primary and secondary concave mirror, with the same curvature, and the same tilt to the main axis. Most Yolos use toroidal reflectors. The Yolo design eliminates coma, but leaves significant astigmatism, which is reduced by deformation of the secondary mirror by some form of warping harness, or alternatively, polishing a toroidal figure into the secondary. Like Schiefspieglers, many Yolo variations have been pursued. The needed amount of toroidal shape can be transferred entirely or partially to the primary mirror. In large focal ratios optical assemblies, both primary and secondary mirror can be left spherical and a spectacle correcting lens is added between the secondary mirror and the focal plane (catadioptric Yolo). The addition of a convex, long focus tertiary mirror leads to Leonard's Solano configuration. The Solano telescope doesn't contain any toric surfaces. =Liquid-mirror telescopes= One design of telescope uses a rotating mirror consisting of a liquid metal in a tray that is spun at constant speed. As the tray spins, the liquid forms a paraboloidal surface of essentially unlimited size. This allows making very big telescope mirrors (over 6 metres), but unfortunately they cannot be steered, as they always point vertically. Focal planes = Prime focus = A prime focus telescope design. The observer/camera is at the focal point (shown as a red X). In a prime focus design no secondary optics are used, the image is accessed at the focal point of the primary mirror. At the focal point is some type of structure for holding a film plate or electronic detector. In the past, in very large telescopes, an observer would sit inside the telescope in an \\"observing cage\\" to directly view the image or operate a camera. Nowadays CCD cameras allow for remote operation of the telescope from almost anywhere in the world. The space available at prime focus is severely limited by the need to avoid obstructing the incoming light. Radio telescopes often have a prime focus design. The mirror is replaced by a metal surface for reflecting radio waves, and the observer is an antenna. = Cassegrain focus = Cassegrain design For telescopes built to the Cassegrain design or other related designs, the image is formed behind the primary mirror, at the focal point of the secondary mirror. An observer views through the rear of the telescope, or a camera or other instrument is mounted on the rear. Cassegrain focus is commonly used for amateur telescopes or smaller research telescopes. However, for large telescopes with correspondingly large instruments, an instrument at Cassegrain focus must move with the telescope as it slews; this places additional requirements on the strength of the instrument support structure, and potentially limits the movement of the telescope in order to avoid collision with obstacles such as walls or equipment inside the observatory. = Nasmyth and coud√© focus = Nasmyth/coud√© light path. Nasmyth The Nasmyth design is similar to the Cassegrain except the light is not directed through a hole in the primary mirror; instead, a third mirror reflects the light to the side of the telescope to allow for the mounting of heavy instruments. This is a very common design in large research telescopes. Coud√© Adding further optics to a Nasmyth-style telescope to deliver the light (usually through the declination axis) to a fixed focus point that does not move as the telescope is reoriented gives a coud√© focus (from the French word for elbow). The coud√© focus gives a narrower field of view than a Nasmyth focus and is used with very heavy instruments that do not need a wide field of view. One such application is high-resolution spectrographs that have large collimating mirrors (ideally with the same diameter as the telescope's primary mirror) and very long focal lengths. Such instruments could not withstand being moved, and adding mirrors to the light path to form a coud√© train, diverting the light to a fixed position to such an instrument housed on or below the observing floor (and usually built as an unmoving integral part of the observatory building) was the only option. The 60-inch Hale telescope (1.5 m), Hooker Telescope, 200-inch Hale Telescope, Shane Telescope, and Harlan J. Smith Telescope all were built with coud√© foci instrumentation. The development of echelle spectrometers allowed high- resolution spectroscopy with a much more compact instrument, one which can sometimes be successfully mounted on the Cassegrain focus. Since inexpensive and adequately stable computer-controlled alt-az telescope mounts were developed in the 1980s, the Nasmyth design has generally supplanted the coud√© focus for large telescopes. =Fibre-fed spectrographs= For instruments requiring very high stability, or that are very large and cumbersome, it is desirable to mount the instrument on a rigid structure, rather than moving it with the telescope. Whilst transmission of the full field of view would require a standard coud√© focus, spectroscopy typically involves the measurement of only a few discrete objects, such as stars or galaxies. It is therefore feasible to collect light from these objects with optical fibers at the telescope, placing the instrument at an arbitrary distance from the telescope. Examples of fiber-fed spectrographs include the planet-hunting spectrographs HARPS or ESPRESSO. Additionally, the flexibility of optical fibers allow light to be collected from any focal plane; for example, the HARPS spectrograph utilises the Cassegrain focus of the ESO 3.6 m Telescope, whilst the Prime Focus Spectrograph is connected to the prime focus of the Subaru telescope.

It was established in 1964, and opened for classes in 1965 after acquiring the entirety of Fenn College, a private school that had been in operation since 1923. CSU absorbed the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in 1969. Today it is part of the University System of Ohio, has more than 120,000 alumni, and offers over 200 academic programs. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". History Public education in Cleveland was first started in 1870, when Cleveland YMCA began to offer free classes. By 1921, the program had grown enough to become separate from YMCA, being renamed Cleveland YMCA School of Technology. Two years later, the school offered courses towards a bachelor's degree for the first time. This is now regarded as Fenn College's founding date, although the college would not be formally renamed until 1929. Fenn College took over several buildings in the area including Fenn Tower, Stilwell Hall, and Foster Hall. In 1964, the State of Ohio purchased the entirety of Fenn College's campus in downtown Cleveland and established a commuter college that targeted area residents. This new institution became known as Cleveland State University. Industrialist James J. Nance served as Chair of the first Board of Trustees. Over the next several decades, Cleveland State University quickly grew in size, and claimed over 15,000 students in 1997. However, only six hundred students resided in University housing. In the mid 2000s, President Michael Schwartz ended open admissions and implemented a vision to move from a U.S. News & World Report fourth tier university to a second tier university. 2020 Covid-19 Remote Learning On March 11, 2020, an email was sent to Cleveland State students regarding the changes made due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It also has a satellite campus in Westlake, Ohio which is in the Greater Cleveland metropolitan area in Cuyahoga County. As of spring 2013, the combined student body (undergraduate and graduate students) totaled over 17,000. =Campus expansion= In 2006, Cleveland State University completed its state-of-the-art student Recreation Center, and a renovation of Parker Hannifan Hall for the College of Graduate Studies. To make the campus more amenable to residence and increase the number of students living on campus thousands of housing units were built, anchored by a new dormitory, Fenn Tower, a reuse of the school's most historic building. Fenn Tower housed what was the world's longest Foucault pendulum, but the pendulum was removed during the residence hall renovation in 2006 and is now in the Cleveland State University archives. The university worked with private developers and the City of Cleveland to develop housing, retail, and \\"collegetown\\" amenities around Fenn Tower, particularly along the main thoroughfare of Euclid Avenue. In 2010, Euclid Avenue was upgraded as part of the Euclid Corridor Project which brought bus rapid transit to the university and connected Public Square in downtown Cleveland to University Circle, approximately four miles to the east.city.http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/03/csu_officials_envision_large_e.html Cleveland State University's $65 million construction project, intended to transform the campus from a mostly commuter school into a residential campus, included the new Student Center and Julka Hull, which houses the College of Education and School of Nursing. Both projects were finished in 2010. In 2011, the new Euclid Commons dorms complex, which features apartment-style living for CSU students, opened. That same year, the university's Dramatic Arts Program moved into the renovated Middough Building and Allen Theatre at Playhouse Square Center in collaboration with the Cleveland Play House. In 2012, CSU opened the Galleries At CSU on Euclid Avenue. Also in 2012, Cleveland State University partnered with the South China University of Technology allowing students to complete their education and receive joint degrees. During the fall semester of 2012, the first phase of the private Langston apartment and retail complex opened along Chester Avenue across from Rhodes Tower. In the spring semester of 2013, the former Viking Hall dormitory was torn down to make way for the university's new Center for Health Professions. This was opened in the fall of 2015. The University is partnering with Northeast Ohio Medical University or NEOMED to train future health care professionals to specifically work in urban settings. They are working on adding a new physics department onto the campus and starting to build a better physics department. In 2018, CSU established the CSU School of Film and Media Arts, having used a $7.5 million appropriation from the State of Ohio to renovate an entire floor of the IdeaStream Center at Playhouse Square. It is the first standalone film school in the State of Ohio. =Student media= The campus' student-run radio station, 89.3 WCSB, has a 630-Watt transmitter on top of Rhodes Tower (formerly called University Tower). Additionally, Cleveland State is served in print by The Cauldron, an independent student newspaper, The Cleveland Stater, a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication, The Vindicator,https://www.thevindi.com/about-us Cleveland State University's art and culture magazine, and The Gavel which won the 2005 American Bar Association's -Student Division's first prize for the best law school newspaper in the country. There is no student television station at this time, though the university offers a film production and video production major with courses through its Digital Video Communication Center and a variety of related majors through the School of Film and Media Arts. =Information technology= CSU is a member of the OneCommunity (formerly OneCleveland) computer network, an initiative of Case Western Reserve University that connects nonprofit institutions throughout Northeast Ohio, allowing large scale collaborations over a high-speed fiber optic network. =Greek Organizations= Cleveland State University is home to 4 NIC fraternities, Delta Sigma Phi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Tau Gamma, and Tau Kappa Epsilon. There are 4 NPC sororities, Alpha Sigma Alpha, Delta Zeta, Phi Mu, and Theta Phi Alpha and there are 4 NPHC organizations, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Sigma Gamma Rho. Athletics When the school was still known as Fenn College, the sports teams' nickname was the Foxes. When the University was renamed Cleveland State, the nickname changed as well, and CSU's sports teams became the \\"Vikings\\". That nickname stands to this day. The school colors are forest green and white. For many years the school mascot was the comic strip character H√§gar the Horrible along with his wife Helga, and the couple appeared at sporting events as well as on University literature. A new mascot, \\"Vike\\" was introduced in 1997 and Hagar was phased out by 1998. Another new mascot named \\"Magnus\\" was introduced in August 2007. Cleveland State fields varsity teams in seventeen sports. Most of the teams compete in the Horizon League. The men's basketball team was noteworthy in 1986 when seeded 14th in the NCAA tournament, it upset heavily favored 3-seed Indiana and St. Joseph's before being beaten by Navy by one point, an unprecedented achievement for such a low seed. The Vikes made yet another NCAA tournament appearance in 2009, upsetting the highly favored 4th seeded Wake Forest before falling to the University of Arizona in the second round. The school also fields a wrestling team that competes in the Mid- American Conference. =Fielding a football team= On October 14, 2008, CSU President Michael Schwartz stated \\"he wants a blue ribbon panel to give him a recommendation on the football team before July 1, 2009, when he was scheduled to retire. He also said the program will have to be structured to pay for itself.\\" The establishment of a football team became an official item on the student government election ballot. Although over two-thirds of the voters favored establishment of a football team over half of them were not willing to pay a fee for Division I non-scholarship football in addition to any potential future tuition increases that may be instituted by the University.Question 1: Are you interested in having Cleveland State University add a Division I non- scholarship football team (e.g. University of Dayton, Butler University) to its intercollegiate athletic program? 1.

The real curves are hard to detect visually, giving the corrector plate the appearance of being an optically flat window. A Schmidt corrector plate is an aspheric lens which corrects the spherical aberration introduced by the spherical primary mirror of the Schmidt or Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope designs. It was invented by Bernhard Schmidt in 1931, although it may have been independently invented by Finnish astronomer Yrj√∂ V√§is√§l√§ in 1924 (sometimes called the Schmidt-V√§is√§l√§ camera as a result).telescope—≤ptics.net, 10.2.2. - Full- aperture Schmidt corrector: Schmidt camera Schmidt originally introduced it as part of a wide-field photographic catadioptric telescope, the Schmidt camera.

Function left Example of an optical system using just a spherical mirror (top) and a spherical mirror combined with a Schmidt corrector plate (bottom). Schmidt corrector plates work because they are aspheric lenses with spherical aberration that is equal to but opposite of the spherical primary mirrors they are placed in front of. They are placed at the center of curvature \\"C\\" of the mirrors for a pure Schmidt camera and just behind the prime focus for a Schmidt-Cassegrain. The Schmidt corrector is thicker in the middle and the edge. This corrects the light paths so light reflected from the outer part of the mirror and light reflected from the inner portion of the mirror is brought to the same common focus \\"F\\". The Schmidt corrector only corrects for spherical aberration. It does not change the focal length of the system. Manufacture Schmidt corrector plates can be manufactured in many ways. The most basic method, called the \\"classical approach\\",METHOD FOR MAKING REPLICA CONTOUR BLOCK MASTERS FOR PRODUCING SCHMIDT CORRECTOR PLATES, United States Patent 3837124 involves directly figuring the corrector by grinding and polishing the aspherical shape into a flat glass blank using specially shaped and sized tools. This method requires a high degree of skill and training on the part of the optical engineer creating the corrector.Rod Mollise, Down with Love, uncle-rods.blogspot.com, Sunday, February 21, 2010 Schmidt himself worked out a second, more elegant, scheme for producing the complex figure needed for the correcting plate. A thin glass disk with a perfectly polished accurate flat form was placed on a heavy metal pan. The upper edge of the pan was ground at a precise angle or bevel based on the coefficient of elasticity of the particular type of glass plate that was being used. The glass plate was sealed to the ground edge of the pan, then a vacuum pump was used to exhaust the air until a particular negative pressure had been achieved. This caused the glass plate to warp slightly. The exposed side was then ground and polished to a perfect flat. When the vacuum was released, the plate sprang back until its bottom surface was again plane, while the upper surface had the correct figure. Schmidt's vacuum figuring method is rarely used today. The glass plate will usually break if bent enough to generate a curve for telescopes of focal ratio f/2.5 or faster. Also, for fast focal ratios, the curve obtained is not sufficiently exact and requires additional hand correction. A third method, invented in 1970 for Celestron by Tom Johnson and John O'rourke,Tammy Plotner, universetoday.com, Celestron Telescope uses a vacuum pan with the correct shape of the curve pre-shaped into the bottom of the pan, called a \\"master block\\". This removes the need to have to hold a shape by applying an exact vacuum and allows for the mass production of corrector plates of the same exact shape. The technical difficulties associated with the production of Schmidt corrector plates led some designers, such as Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov and Albert Bouwers, to come up with alternative designs using more conventional Meniscus corrector lenses.John F.

In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo- Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, the major powers restructured the map of the Balkan region. They reversed some of the extreme gains claimed by Russia in the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano, but the Ottomans lost their major holdings in Europe. It was one of three major peace agreements in the period after the 1815 Congress of Vienna. It was the final act of the Congress of Berlin (13 June ‚Äì 13 July 1878) and included Great Britain and Ireland, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Germany's Otto von Bismarck was the chairman and dominant personality. The most important task of the Congress was to decide the fate of Bulgaria, but Bulgaria itself was excluded from participation in the talks, at Russian insistence. At the time, as it was not a sovereign state, Bulgaria was not a subject of international law, and the same went for the Bulgarians themselves. The exclusion was already an established fact in the great powers' Constantinople Conference, which had been held one year before without any Bulgarian participation. The most notable result of the conference was the official (de jure) recognition of actual (de facto) newly independent states of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro. Background The Paris Peace Treaty of 1856, which ended the Crimean War, had made the Black Sea a neutral territory. The treaty had protected the Ottoman Empire, ended the Holy Alliance (Austria, Prussia and Russia) and weakened Russia's position in Europe. In 1870, Russia invoked the doctrine of rebus sic stantibus and effectively terminated the treaty by breaching provisions concerning the neutrality of the Black Sea. The great powers became increasingly convinced that the Ottoman Empire would not be able to hold its territories in Europe. In 1875, the Herzegovina uprising resulted in the Great Eastern Crisis. As the conflict in the Balkans intensified, atrocities during the 1876 April Uprising in Bulgaria inflamed anti-Turkish sentiments in Russia and Britain, which eventually culminated in the Russo- Turkish War of 1877.  Terms  The treaty formally recognized the independence of the de facto sovereign principalities of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and the autonomy of Bulgaria although the latter de facto functioned independently and was divided into three parts: the Principality of Bulgaria, the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia and Macedonia, which was given back to the Ottomans, thus undoing Russian plans for an independent and Russophile \\"Greater Bulgaria\\". The Treaty of San Stefano had created a Bulgarian state, which was just what Britain and Austria-Hungary feared the most. The Treaty of Berlin confirmed most of the Russian gains from the Ottoman Empire specified in the Treaty of San Stefan, but the valley of Alashkerd and the town of Bayazid were returned to the Ottomans. Despite the pleas of the Romanian delegates, Romania was forced to cede southern Bessarabia to the Russian Empire. As a compensation, Romania received Dobruja, including the Danube Delta. The treaty also limited the Russian occupation of Bulgaria to 9 months, which limited the time during which Russian troops and supplies could be moved through Romanian territory. The three newly independent states subsequently proclaimed themselves kingdoms: Romania in 1881, Serbia in 1882 and Montenegro in 1910, and Bulgaria proclaimed full independence in 1908 after it had united with Eastern Rumelia in 1885. annexed Bosnia in 1908, sparking the Bosnian crisis, a major European crisis that reinforced alliances.Bosnian Crisis The Treaty of Berlin accorded special legal status to some religious groups and also would serve as a model for the Minority Treaties, which would be established within the framework of the League of Nations. It stipulated that Romania recognize non-Christians (Jews and Muslims) as full citizens. It also vaguely called for a border rectification between Greece and the Ottoman Empire, which occurred after protracted negotiations in 1881, with the transfer of Thessaly to Greece. In the \\"Salisbury Circular\\" of 1 April, British Foreign Secretary, the Marquess of Salisbury, made clear his own and his government's objections to the Treaty of San Stefano and its favourable position of Russia.Walker, Christopher J. (1980), Armenia: The Survival of A Nation, London: Croom Helm, p. 112 Historian AJP Taylor wrote, \\"If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for Beaconsfield in his wilder moments, had expected less and were, therefore, less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878: 'We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.'\\" The Kosovo Vilayet remained part of the Ottoman Empire. Austria-Hungary was allowed to station military garrisons in the Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. The Vilayet of Bosnia was placed under Austro-Hungarian occupation although it formally remained part of the Ottoman Empire until it was annexed by Austria-Hungary thirty years later, on 5 October 1908. The Austro-Hungarian garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar were withdrawn in 1908, after the annexation of the Vilayet of Bosnia and the resulting Bosnian Crisis, to reach a compromise with the Ottoman Empire, which was struggling with internal strife because of the Young Turk Revolution (1908). The chaotic situation in the Ottoman Empire also allowed Bulgaria to formally declare its independence on 5 October 1908.

During its existence, it was the third most populous empire after the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom in Europe. Along with Prussia, it was one of the two major powers of the German Confederation. Geographically, it was the third largest empire in Europe after the Russian Empire and the First French Empire (621,538 square kilometres; 239,977 sq mi). Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it partially overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The Kingdom of Hungary ‚Äî as Regnum Independens ‚Äî was administered by its own institutions separately from the rest of the empire. After Austria was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was adopted, joining together the Kingdom of Hungary and the Empire of Austria to form Austria-Hungary. History =Foundation= Changes shaping the nature of the Holy Roman Empire took place during conferences in Rastatt (1797‚Äì1799) and Regensburg (1801‚Äì1803). On 24 March 1803, the Imperial Recess () was declared, which reduced the number of ecclesiastical states from 81 to only 3 and the free imperial cities from 51 to 6. This measure was aimed at replacing the old constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, but the actual consequence of the Imperial Recess was the end of the empire. Taking this significant change into consideration, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II created the title Emperor of Austria, for himself and his successors. In 1804, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, who was also ruler of the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy, founded the Empire of Austria, in which all his lands were included. In doing so he created a formal overarching structure for the Habsburg Monarchy, which had functioned as a composite monarchy for about three hundred years. He did so because he foresaw either the end of the Holy Roman Empire, or the eventual accession as Holy Roman Emperor of Napoleon, who had earlier that year adopted the title of an Emperor of the French; Francis II eventually abandoned the title of German-Roman Emperor later in 1806. To safeguard his dynasty's imperial status he adopted the additional hereditary title of Emperor of Austria. Apart from now being included in a new \\"Kaiserthum\\", the workings of the overarching structure and the status of its component lands at first stayed much the same as they had been under the composite monarchy that existed before 1804. This was especially demonstrated by the status of the Kingdom of Hungary, a country that had never been a part of the Holy Roman Empire and which had always been considered a separate realm‚Äîa status that was affirmed by Article X, which was added to Hungary's constitution in 1790 during the phase of the composite monarchy and described the state as a Regnum Independens. Hungary's affairs remained administered by its own institutions (King and Diet) as they had been beforehand. Thus no Imperial institutions were involved in its government.\\"Vor dem Jahr 1848 is[t] das Kaisertum √ñsterreich verfassungsrechtlich als ein monarchischer Einheitsstaat auf differenziert f√∂deralistischer Grundlage zu sehen, wobei die besondere Stel[l]ung Ungarns im Rahmen dieses Gesamtstaates stets offenkundig war. Eine weitere Differenzierung der f√∂deralistischen Grundlage erfolgte ab 1815 durch die Zugeh√∂rigkeit eines teiles des Kaisertums zum Deutschen Bund.\\" \\"Before 1848 the Austrian Empire can be regarded in constitutional law as a unitary monarchy on a differentiated federalistic basis, whereby the special position of Hungary within the framework of this federal entity was always evident. A further differentiation of the federalistic position followed from 1815 through the affiliation of a part of the empire to the German federation.\\"J√≥zsef Zachar, Austerlitz, 1805. december 2. A h√°rom cs√°sz√°r csat√°ja ‚Äì magyar szemmel, In: Eszm√©k, forradalmak, h√°bor√∫k. Vad√°sz S√°ndor 80 √©ves, ELTE, Budapest, 2010 p. 557 The fall and dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was accelerated by French intervention in the Empire in September 1805. On 20 October 1805, an Austrian army led by General Karl Mack von Leiberich was defeated by French armies near the town of Ulm. The French victory resulted in the capture of 20,000 Austrian soldiers and many cannons. Napoleon's army won another victory at Austerlitz on 2 December 1805. Francis was forced into negotiations with the French from 4 to 6 December 1805, which concluded with an armistice on 6 December 1805. The French victories encouraged rulers of certain imperial territories to ally themselves with the French and assert their formal independence from the Empire. On 10 December 1805, Maximilian IV Joseph, the prince-elector and Duke of Bavaria, proclaimed himself King, followed by the Duke of W√ºrttemberg Frederick III on 11 December. Charles Frederick, Margrave of Baden, was given the title of Grand Duke on 12 December. Each of these new states became French allies. The Treaty of Pressburg between France and Austria, signed in Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia) on 26 December, enlarged the territory of Napoleon's German allies at the expense of defeated Austria. Francis II agreed to the humiliating Treaty of Pressburg (26 December 1805), which in practice meant the dissolution of the long-lived Holy Roman Empire and a reorganization under a Napoleonic imprint of the German territories lost in the process into a precursor state of what became modern Germany, those possessions nominally having been part of the Holy Roman Empire within the present boundaries of Germany, as well as other measures weakening Austria and the Habsburgs in other ways. Certain Austrian holdings in Germany were passed to French allies‚Äîthe King of Bavaria, the King of W√ºrttemberg and the Elector of Baden. Austrian claims on those German states were renounced without exception. On 12 July 1806, the Confederation of the Rhine was established, comprising 16 sovereigns and countries. This confederation, under French influence, put an end to the Holy Roman Empire. On 6 August 1806, even Francis recognized the new state of things and proclaimed the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, as he did not want Napoleon to succeed him. This action was unrecognized by George III of the United Kingdom who was also the Elector of Hanover and had also lost his German territories around Hanover to Napoleon. His claims were later settled by the creation of the Kingdom of Hanover which was held by George's British heirs until Queen Victoria's accession, when it split into the British and Hanoverian royal families. =Metternich era= Karl von Schwarzenberg and the monarchs of Austria, Prussia, and Russia after the Battle of Leipzig, 1813 Klemens von Metternich became Foreign Minister in 1809. He also held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848, under both Francis II and his son Ferdinand I. The period of 1815-1848 is also referred to as the \\"Age of Metternich\\".Sked, Alan. The Decline and Fall of the Habsburg Empire, 1815-1918. London: Longman, 1989. Print. During this period, Metternich controlled the Habsburg Monarchy's foreign policy. He also had a major influence in European politics. He was known for his strong conservative views and approach in politics. Metternich's policies were strongly against revolution and liberalism.Jelavich, Barbara. The Habsburg Empire in European Affairs: 1814-1918. Chicago: Rand Mcnally, 1969. Print. In his opinion, liberalism was a form of legalized revolution.Tuncer, Huner. \\"Metternich and the Modern Era.\\" ARTS-CULTURE -. Daily News, 6 Sept. 1996. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. Metternich believed that absolute monarchy was the only proper system of government. This notion influenced his anti-revolutionary policy to ensure the continuation of the Habsburg monarchy in Europe. Metternich was a practitioner of balance-of-power diplomacy.Sofka, James R. \\"Metternich's Theory of European Order: A Political Agenda for 'Perpetual Peace'.\\" The Review of Politics 60.01 (1998): 115. Web. His foreign policy aimed to maintain international political equilibrium to preserve the Habsburgs' power and influence in international affairs. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Metternich was the chief architect of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Austrian Empire was the main beneficiary from the Congress of Vienna and it established an alliance with Britain, Prussia, and Russia forming the Quadruple Alliance. The Austrian Empire also gained new territories from the Congress of Vienna, and its influence expanded to the north through the German Confederation and also into Italy. Due to the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Austria was the leading member of the German Confederation. Following the Congress, the major European powers agreed to meet and discuss resolutions in the event of future disputes or revolutions. Because of Metternich's main role in the architecture of the Congress, these meetings are also referred to as the \\"Metternich congress\\" or \\"Metternich system\\". Under Metternich as the Austrian foreign minister, other congresses would meet to resolve European foreign affairs. These included the Congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818), Carlsbad (1819), Troppau (1820), Laibach (1821), and Verona (1822). The Metternich congresses aimed to maintain the political equilibrium among the European powers and prevent revolutionary efforts. These meetings also aimed to resolve foreign issues and disputes without resorting to violence. By means of these meetings and by allying the Austrian Empire with other European powers whose monarchs had a similar interest in preserving conservative political direction, Metternich was able to establish the Austrian Empire's influence on European politics. Also, because Metternich used the fear of revolutions among European powers, which he also shared, he was able to establish security and predominance of the Habsburgs in Europe. Under Metternich, nationalist revolts in Austrian north Italy and in the German states were forcibly crushed. At home, he pursued a similar policy to suppress revolutionary and liberal ideals. He employed the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, which used strict censorship of education, press and speech to repress revolutionary and liberal concepts. Metternich also used a wide-ranging spy network to dampen down unrest. Metternich operated very freely with regard to foreign policy under Emperor Francis II's reign. Francis died in 1835. This date marks the decline of Metternich's influence in the Austrian Empire. Francis' heir was his son Ferdinand I, but he suffered from an intellectual disability. Ferdinand's accession preserved the Habsburg dynastic succession, but he was not capable of ruling. The leadership of the Austrian Empire was transferred to a state council composed of Metternich, Francis II's brother Archduke Louis, and Count Franz Anton Kolowrat, who later became the first Minister-President of the Austrian Empire. The liberal Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire forced Metternich's resignation. Metternich is remembered for his success in maintaining the status quo and the Habsburg influence in international affairs. No Habsburg foreign minister following Metternich held a similar position within the empire for such a long time nor held such a vast influence on European foreign affairs. Historians often remember the Metternich era as a period of stagnation: the Austrian Empire fought no wars nor did it undergo any radical internal reforms.Crankshaw, Edward. The Fall of the House of Habsburg. New York: Viking, 1963. Print. However, it was also thought of as a period of economic growth and prosperity in the Austrian Empire. The population of Austria rose to 37.5 million by 1843. Urban expansion also occurred and the population of Vienna reached 400,000. During the Metternich era, the Austrian Empire also maintained a stable economy and reached an almost balanced budget, despite having a major deficit following the Napoleonic Wars.\\"History of Austria, Austria in the Age of Metternich.\\" History of Austria, Austria in the Age of Metternich. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. =Revolutions of 1848= Battle of Kom√°rom during the Hungarian Revolution, 1849 From March 1848 through November 1849, the Empire was threatened by revolutionary movements, most of which were of a nationalist character. Besides that, liberal and even socialist currents resisted the empire's longstanding conservatism. Although most of the revolution plans failed, some changes were made; significant lasting reforms included the abolition of serfdom, cancellation of censorship and a promise made by Ferdinand I of Austria said to implement a constitution throughout the whole Empire. =The Bach years= After the death of Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg in 1852, the Minister of the Interior Baron Alexander von Bach largely dictated policy in Austria and Hungary. Bach centralized administrative authority for the Austrian Empire, but he also endorsed reactionary policies that reduced freedom of the press and abandoned public trials. He later represented the Absolutist (or Klerikalabsolutist) direction, which culminated in the concordat of August 1855 that gave the Roman Catholic Church control over education and family life. This period in the history of the Austrian Empire would become known as the era of neo-absolutism, or Bach's absolutism. Franz Joseph with his troops at the Battle of Solferino, 1859 The pillars of the so-called Bach system (Bachsches System) were, in the words of Adolf Fischhof, four \\"armies\\": a standing army of soldiers, a sitting army of office holders, a kneeling army of priests and a fawning army of sneaks. Prisons were full of political prisoners, like Czech nationalist journalist and writer Karel Havl√≠ƒçek Borovsk√Ω who was forcibly expatriated (1851‚Äì1855) to Brixen. This exile undermined Borovsk√Ω's health and he died soon afterwards. This affair earned Bach a very bad reputation amongst Czechs and subsequently led to the strengthening of the Czech national movement. However, Bach's relaxed ideological views (apart from the neo-absolutism) led to a great rise in the 1850s of economic freedom. Internal customs duties were abolished, and peasants were emancipated from their feudal obligations. In her capacity as leader of the German Confederation, Austria participated with volunteers in the First War of Schleswig (1848‚Äì1850).Handbook of Austria and Lombardy- Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850‚Äì1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961. Sardinia allied itself with France for the conquest of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia. Austria was defeated in the 1859 armed conflict. The Treaties of Villafranca and Z√ºrich removed Lombardy, except for the part east of the Mincio river, the so-called Mantovano.Mueller 1961, Historical Data, p.H5. =After 1859= The Constitution of 1861 created a House of Lords () and a House of Deputies (). But most nationalities of the monarchy remained dissatisfied. After the second war with Denmark in 1864, Holstein came under Austrian, Schleswig and Lauenburg under Prussian administration. But the internal difficulties continued.Mueller 1961, p.H6. Diets replaced the parliament in 17 provinces, the Hungarians pressed for autonomy, and Venetia was attracted by the now unified Italy. After Austria was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the German Confederation was dissolved, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was adopted. By this act, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Empire of Austria as two separate entities joined together on an equal basis to form the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The frequent abbreviation K.u.K. (Kaiserliche und K√∂nigliche, \\"Imperial and Royal\\") does not refer to that dual monarchy but originated in 1745, when the \\"royal\\" part referred to the Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary. Foreign policy Wellington, Talleyrand, and other European diplomats at the Congress of Vienna, 1815 The Napoleonic Wars dominated Austrian foreign policy from 1804 to 1815. The Austrian army was one of the most formidable forces the French had to face. After Prussia signed a peace treaty with France on 5 April 1795, Austria was forced to carry the main burden of war with Napoleonic France for almost ten years. This severely overburdened the Austrian economy, making the war greatly unpopular. Emperor Francis II therefore refused to join any further war against Napoleon for a long time. On the other hand, Francis II continued to intrigue for the possibility of revenge against France, entering into a secret military agreement with the Russian Empire in November 1804. This convention was to assure mutual cooperation in the case of a new war against France.Gunther Rothenberg, Napoleon's great adversaries: the Archduke Charles and the Austrian army, 1792-1814 (Indiana UP, 1982). Austrian unwillingness to join the Third Coalition was overcome by British subsidies, but the Austrians withdrew from the war yet again after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz. Although the Austrian budget suffered from wartime expenditures and its international position was significantly undermined, the humiliating Treaty of Pressburg provided plenty of time to strengthen the army and economy. Moreover, the ambitious Archduke Charles and Johann Philipp von Stadion never abandoned the goal of further war with France. The Austrian Empire in 1812 Archduke Charles of Austria served as the Head of the Council of War and Commander in Chief of the Austrian army. Endowed with the enlarged powers, he reformed the Austrian Army to preparedness for another war. Johann Philipp von Stadion, the foreign minister, personally hated Napoleon due to an experience of confiscation of his possessions in France by Napoleon. In addition, the third wife of Francis II, Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este, agreed with Stadion's efforts to begin a new war. Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, located in Paris, called for careful advance in the case of the war against France. The defeat of French army at the Battle of Bail√©n in Spain on 27 July 1808 triggered the war. On 9 April 1809, an Austrian force of 170,000 men attacked Bavaria.Robert Goetz, 1805, Austerlitz: Napoleon and the Destruction of the Third Coalition (2005). Despite military defeats‚Äîespecially the Battles of Marengo, Ulm, Austerlitz and Wagram‚Äîand consequently lost territory throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (the Treaties of Campo Formio in 1797, Luneville in 1801, Pressburg in 1806, and Sch√∂nbrunn in 1809), Austria played a decisive part in the overthrow of Napoleon in the campaigns of 1813‚Äì14. It participated in a second invasion of France in 1815, and put an end to Murat's regime in south Italy. The latter period of Napoleonic Wars featured Metternich exerting a large degree of influence over foreign policy in the Austrian Empire, a matter nominally decided by the Emperor. Metternich initially supported an alliance with France, arranging the marriage between Napoleon and Francis II's daughter, Marie-Louise; however, by the 1812 campaign, he had realised the inevitability of Napoleon's downfall and took Austria to war against France. Metternich's influence at the Congress of Vienna was remarkable, and he became not only the premier statesman in Europe but the virtual ruler of the Empire until 1848‚Äîthe Year of Revolutions‚Äîand the rise of liberalism equated to his political downfall. The result was that the Austrian Empire was seen as one of the great powers after 1815, but also as a reactionary force and an obstacle to national aspirations in Italy and Germany.Josephine Bunch Stearns, The Role of Metternich in Undermining Napoleon (University of Illinois Press, 1948). During this time, Metternich was able to maintain an elaborate balance between Prussia, the lesser German states, and Austria in the German Confederation. Thanks to his efforts, Austria was seen as the senior partner with Prussia keeping watch over Germany as a whole. Further, Metternich opposed the weakening of France in the years after Napoleon, and viewed the new monarchy in Paris as an effective tool in keeping Russia at bay. From 1815 to 1848, Metternich steered Austria Imperial foreign policy, and indeed the mood of Europe, and managed to keep peace on the continent despite the growing liberal and radical movements inside most major powers. His resignation in 1848, forced by moderates in the court, and revolutionaries in the streets, may have caused the spread of the revolutions throughout the monarchy. It is stipulated that Metternich's departure emboldened liberal factions in Austria and Hungary, but this cannot be confirmed for certain.

Religious overview In Dharmic spiritual traditions from India, the third eye refers to the ajna (or brow) chakra. The third eye refers to the gate that leads to the inner realms and spaces of higher consciousness. In spirituality, the third eye often symbolizes a state of enlightenment or the evocation of mental images having deeply personal spiritual or psychological significance. The third eye is often associated with religious visions, clairvoyance, the ability to observe chakras and auras,Leadbeater, C. W. The Chakras Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79. precognition, and out-of-body experiences. People who are said to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as seers. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows, representing the enlightenment one achieves through meditation. Hindus also place a \\"tilaka\\" between the eyebrows as a representation of the third eye, which is also seen on expressions of Shiva. Buddhists regard the third eye as the \\"eye of consciousness\\", representing the vantage point from which enlightenment beyond one's physical sight is achieved. In Taoism and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called Zen in Japanese), \\"third eye training\\" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various qigong postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct \\"vibration\\" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach a more advanced meditative state. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the mind's eye, is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism asserts that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth Chakra, forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.The doctrine of the elixir, R. B. Jefferson, Coombe Springs Press 1982, chapter 4: \\"The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs\\". In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the \\"Upper Dan Tien\\" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name \\"muddy pellet\\". According to the Christian teaching of Father Richard Rohr, the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), \\"but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes‚Äîand yet goes further.\\" Rohr refers to this level of awareness as \\"having the mind of Christ\\".Rohr, Richard The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See, The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, , . Adherents of theosophist H. P. Blavatsky have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant pineal gland, which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain.H. P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, 1888, , pp. 289‚Äì306. Reptiles and amphibians sense light via a third parietal eye‚Äîa structure associated with the pineal gland‚Äîwhich serves to regulate their circadian rhythms, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. C. W. Leadbeater thought that by extending an \\"etheric tube\\" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision. It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as quarks.Phillips, Stephen Extrasensory Perception of Quarks Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House . According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295. Rick Strassman has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of DMT (dimethyltryptamine), an entheogen which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death. ()  Philosophy  The use of the phrase mind's eye does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs. Philosopher Daniel Dennett has critiqued this view.Consciousness Explained, Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991. .  In popular literature  The 1959 novel The Third Eye by Lobsang Rampa (born Cyril Henry Hoskin, 19101981, a native of Plympton, Devonshire) introduced a fictional account of the third eye for the first time to a wide popular audience of English-speaking readers.

It is owned by the state of Qatar via its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. The Harrods brand also applies to other enterprises undertaken by the Harrods group of companies including Harrods Estates, Harrods Aviation and Air Harrods, and formerly to Harrods Buenos Aires, sold by Harrods in 1922 and closed .La Naci√≥n newspaper, Buenos Aires, Harrods, the return of an icon of Bienos Aires, April 2010 The store occupies a site and has 330 departments covering of retail space. It is one of the largest and most famous department stores in Europe. The Harrods motto is Omnia Omnibus Ubique, which is Latin for \\"all things for all people, everywhere\\". Several of its departments, including the seasonal Christmas department and the food halls, are well known. History Share of the Harrod's Stores Ltd., issued 7 August 1903 Fashion plate of 1909 showing Londoners walking in front of Harrods Back site of a share from 1903 In 1824, at the age of 25, Charles Henry Harrod established a business at 228 Borough High Street in Southwark. He ran this business, variously listed as a draper, mercer, and a haberdasher, until at least 1831.Rate Books April 1824 to April 1831 held at Local History Library, Borough High Street, Southwark, London.1830 Critchett‚Äôs Directory, London.1832 Robson‚Äôs Directory During 1825, the business was listed as 'Harrod and Wicking, Linen Drapers, Retail',Pigot‚Äôs Directory of 1826‚Äì27 but this partnership was dissolved at the end of that year. His first grocery business appears to be as 'Harrod & Co. Grocers' at 163 Upper Whitecross Street, Clerkenwell, E.C.1., in 1832.1832 Robson's Directory In 1834, in London's East End, he established a wholesale grocery in Stepney at 4 Cable Street with a special interest in tea. In 1849, to escape the vice of the inner city and to capitalise on trade to the Great Exhibition of 1851 in nearby Hyde Park, Harrod took over a small shop in the district of Brompton, on the site of the current store. Beginning in a single room employing two assistants and a messenger boy, Harrod's son Charles Digby Harrod built the business into a thriving retail operation selling medicines, perfumes, stationery, fruits and vegetables. Harrods rapidly expanded, acquired the adjoining buildings, and employed one hundred people by 1881. However, the store's booming fortunes were reversed in early December 1883, when it burnt to the ground. Remarkably, Charles Harrod fulfilled all of his commitments to his customers to make Christmas deliveries that year‚Äîand made a record profit in the process. In short order, a new building was built on the same site, and soon Harrods extended credit for the first time to its best customers, among them Oscar Wilde, Lillie Langtry, Ellen Terry, Charlie Chaplin, No√´l Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, Sigmund Freud, A. A. Milne, and many members of the British Royal Family. A chance meeting in London with businessman, Edgar Cohen, eventually led to Charles Harrod selling his interest in the store for ¬£120,000 via a stock market flotation in 1889. The new company was called Harrod's Stores Limited. Sir Alfred James Newton became chairman and Richard Burbidge managing director. Financier William Mendel was appointed to the board in 1891 and he raised funding for many of the business expansion plans. Richard Burbidge was succeed in 1917 by his son Woodman Burbidge and he in turn by his son Richard in 1935. On 16 November 1898, Harrods debuted England's first \\"moving staircase\\" (escalator) in their Brompton Road stores; the device was actually a woven leather conveyor belt-like unit with a mahogany and \\"silver plate- glass\\" balustrade.\\"The First Moving Staircase in England.\\" The Drapers' Record, 19 November 1898: 465. Nervous customers were offered brandy at the top to revive them after their 'ordeal'. The department store was acquired by House of Fraser in 1959, which in turn was purchased by the Fayed brothers in 1985. In 1994, Harrods was moved out of the House of Fraser Group to remain a private company prior to the group's relisting on the London Stock Exchange. =Qatar Holdings ownership= The Harrods building frontage at night Following denial that it was for sale, Harrods was sold to Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar in May 2010. A fortnight previously, chairman of Harrods since 1985, Mohamed Al-Fayed, had stated that \\"People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. Fair enough. But I put two fingers up to them. It is not for sale. This is not Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca.\\" The sale was concluded in the early hours of 8 May, when Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani came to London to finalise the deal, saying that the acquisition of Harrods would add \\"much value\\" to the investment portfolio of Qatar Holdings while his deputy, Hussain Ali Al- Abdulla, called it a \\"landmark transaction\\". A spokesman for Mohamed Al-Fayed said \\"in reaching the decision to retire, [Fayed] wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued.\\" Al- Fayed later revealed in an interview that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his dividend approved by the trustee of the Harrods pension fund. Al-Fayed said \\"I'm here every day, I can't take my profit because I have to take a permission of those bloody idiots. I say is this right? Is this logic? Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take the trustee's permission to take my profit.\\" Al-Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he will hold for at least six months. With the previously operating Disney Cafe and Disney Store, the Disney at Harrods partnership added the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique salon on 25 November 2013 to those stores. =Significant event timeline= Harrods Furniture Depository in Barnes, London, England *1824: Charles Henry Harrod starts his first business as a draper, at 228, Borough High Street, Southwark, London. *1834: Charles Henry Harrod (1799‚Äì1885) founds a wholesale grocery in Stepney, East London *1849: Harrods moves to the Knightsbridge area of London, near Hyde Park *1861: Harrods undergoes a transformation when it was taken over by Harrod's son, Charles Digby Harrod (1841‚Äì1905) *1883: On 6 December, fire guts the shop buildings, giving the family the opportunity to rebuild on a grander scale *1889: Charles Digby Harrod retires, and Harrods shares are floated on the London Stock Exchange under the name Harrod's Stores Limited *1905: Begun in 1894, the present building is completed to the design of architect Charles William Stephens. *1914: Harrods opens its first and only foreign branch in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The gold products ranged from to , and could be purchased within Harrods Bank. They also offered storage services, as well as the ability to sell back gold to Harrods in the future. Royal warrants Harrods was the holder of royal warrants from: *Queen Elizabeth II (Provisions and Household Goods) *The Duke of Edinburgh (Outfitters) *The Prince of Wales (Outfitters and Saddlers) *Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (China and Glass) In August 2010, in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, chairman Mohamed Al-Fayed revealed that he had burnt Harrods royal warrants, after taking them down in 2000. Harrods had held the Royal warrants since 1910. Describing the warrants as a \\"curse\\", Al-Fayed claimed that business had tripled since their removal. The Duke of Edinburgh removed his warrant in January 2000, and the other warrants were removed from Harrods by Al-Fayed in December, pending their five-yearly review. The Duke of Edinburgh had been banned from Harrods by Al-Fayed. Film of the burning of the warrants in 2009 was shown in the final scene of Unlawful Killing, a film funded by Al-Fayed and directed by Keith Allen. Memorials Innocent Victims, Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed memorial at Harrods Since the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed, Mohamed Al-Fayed's son, two memorials commissioned by Al-Fayed have been erected inside Harrods to the couple. The first, located at the base of the Egyptian Escalator, was unveiled on 12 April 1998, consisting of photographs of the two behind a pyramid-shaped display that holds a wine glass smudged with lipstick from Diana's last dinner as well as what is described as an engagement ring Dodi purchased the day before they died.Rick Steves, Getting Up To Snuff In London, /www.ricksteves.com. The second memorial, unveiled in 2005 and located by the escalator at door three is entitled Innocent Victims, a bronze statue of the two dancing on a beach beneath the wings of an albatross, a bird said to symbolise the \\"Holy Spirit\\".Harrods unveils Diana, Dodi statue, CNN.com, 1 September 2005. The sculpture was created by William Mitchell, a close friend of Al-Fayed and artistic design advisor to Harrods for 40 years. Al-Fayed said he wanted to keep the pair's \\"spirit alive\\" through the statue. After the death of Michael Jackson, Al- Fayed announced that they had already been discussing plans to build a memorial statue. This was unveiled in April 2011 at the rear of Craven Cottage football ground (Fulham F.C.) but removed in September 2013 on the orders of new club owner Shahid Khan. Dress code In 1989, Harrods introduced a dress code for customers. The store turns away people whose dress is not in compliance with the code. Forbidden items include uniforms; cycling shorts; high-cut shorts, Bermuda or beach shorts; swimwear; athletic singlets; flip flops or thong sandals; bare feet; bare midriff; or wearing dirty or unkempt clothing. Patrons found not in compliance with the code and barred from entry include pop star Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Luke Goss, a Scout troop, a woman with a Mohican hair cut, and the entire first team from FC Shakhtar Donetsk who were wearing tracksuits. Conversely, pupils in uniform from nearby notable Hill House School have never been denied entry, and until 2018 were supplied uniforms by Harrods. Size The store occupies a site and has over one million square feet () of selling space in over 330 departments making it the biggest department store in Europe. The UK's second-biggest shop, Selfridges, Oxford Street, is a little over half the size with of selling space. By comparison Europe's second-largest department store the KaDeWe in Berlin has a retail space of . Criticism Harrods and Mohamed Al-Fayed were criticised for selling real animal fur with regular protests organised outside Harrods. Harrods is the only department store in Britain that has continued to sell fur. Harrods was sharply criticised in 2004 by the Hindu community for marketing a line of feminine underwear (designed by Roberto Cavalli) which featured the images of Indian goddesses. The line was eventually withdrawn and formal apologies were made. Harrods has been criticised by Guardian journalist Sali Hughes as \\"deeply sexist\\" for making female employees wear six kinds of makeup at all times without requiring this of male employees. They have also been criticised after reports came out claiming that Harrods staff told a black woman that she would not be employed unless she chemically straightened her hair, stating that her natural hair style was \\"unprofessional\\". Harrods' restaurants and cafes included a 12.5% discretionary service charge on customers' bills, but failed to share the full proceeds with kitchen and service staff. Several employees joined the UVW union, which claimed that 483 affected employees were losing up to ¬£5,000 each in tips every year. A surprise protest and roadblock organised by the union outside Harrods during the January sales of 2017 was followed by an announcement that \\"an improved tronc system\\" would give 100% of service charges to staff. Litigation In 1986, the town of Otorohanga, New Zealand, briefly changed its name to \\"Harrodsville\\". This was a protest in support of a restaurateur, Henry Harrod of Palmerston North, who was being forced to change the name of his restaurant following the threat of lawsuits from Mohamed Al Fayed, the then owner of Harrods department store. As a show of solidarity for Henry Harrod, and in anticipation of actions against other similar-sounding businesses, it was proposed that every business in Otorohanga change its name to \\"Harrods\\". With the support of the District Council, Otorohanga temporarily changed the town's name to Harrodsville. After being lampooned in the British tabloids, Al Fayed dropped the legal action and Harrodsville and its shops reverted to their former names. The town's response raised widespread media interest around the world, with the BBC World Service and newspapers in Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Canada covering the story. On 27 October 2008, in the case of Harrods Ltd v.

Aftermath In June 1926, German banks granted to the Soviet Union credits to the total amount of 300 million marks \\"thanks to the cooperation of the German Government\\". Interest was fixed at 9.4% per annum. In October 1926, the Soviet Government invited a notable group of Reichstag deputies to Moscow. Georgy Chicherin, visiting Berlin at December 1926, remarked on the improvement of the present German-Soviet relation in comparison with 1925.

The agreement was reaffirmed by the Treaty of Berlin, 1926. Background Both Germany and the RSFSR were left vulnerable in the period following the end of World War I. Germany had lost the war, leaving it diplomatically isolated, and the Treaty of Versailles after the war led to German disarmament and the cession of German territories, including all her colonies. The Soviet Union had left the war before its end in 1917, due to the Bolshevik revolution and ceded many of its Western territories to Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk; after Germany's defeat, this territory was transformed into a number of new, independent states, including Poland. Like the Germans, the Russians were left diplomatically isolated as their transition to communist rule had led to the loss of western allies as \\"the policies pursued by the victors, especially France, left no alternative to Germany but to move closer to Russia\\" Germany initially hoped to pursue peaceful changes to the Versailles Treaty, and its main territorial goal was to reclaim certain portions of western Poland. An initially conciliatory posture failed in 1919, leading Germany to institute an economic blockade of Poland in January 1920.Lee and Michalka 50 This effort to force changes also failed, and led to severe losses for German businessmen.Lee and Michalka 51 These failures led Germany to look for other alternatives, which reached their most extreme form in the proposal of Hans von Seeckt, commander of the Reichswehr (German military), who suggested that Germany and the Soviet Union should conclude an alliance to jointly invade Poland, followed by a war on France. His proposals did not have much impact on official policy, but the general idea of seeking closer cooperation with Russia began to gain currency among a number of groups, including German businessmen who saw market opportunities in Russia.Lee and Michalka 58-59 Like Germany, Russia hoped to make territorial gains at Poland's expense, but it was left without an effective means of doing so. Early in 1919, the Polish-Soviet War had broken out over border disputes between the two countries. After initial Soviet victories, the Poles counterattacked successfully, and a compromise peace was reached in March 1921, leaving Soviet desires for border revision largely unfulfilled. The war also left the Soviets even further isolated from Britain and France.Kochan 115-116 This common isolation and interest in revision in Poland led to a natural sympathy between Russia and Germany. At the Tenth Party Conference in 1921, the Soviets settled on a policy of pursuing opportunities for trade with the Western powers, which could supply badly needed industrial materials. As such, > Germany and Russia were rapidly moving closer together because each could > use what the other had to offer. Russia needed Germany's skilled, now idle > industrial workers, its engineers, and general knowledge of advanced > industrial methods. For Germany, Russia provided an outlet for its energies, > a market for its products, and a source of raw materials. The joint German-Soviet concerns first led to signing, in May 1921, of a treaty between the two nations under which Germany recognized the Soviet regime as the only legitimate government of Russia, and agreed to suspend relations with all other groups which still claimed power. This agreement paved the way for future cooperation between the two.Kochan 117 Text of agreement The German Government, represented by Dr Walther Rathenau, Minister of State, and the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, represented by M. Tchitcherin, People's Commissary, have agreed upon the following provisions: Article 1 The two Governments are agreed that the arrangements arrived at between the German Reich and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, with regard to questions dating from the period of war between Germany and Russia, shall be definitely settled upon the following basis: [a] The German Reich and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic mutually agree to waive their claims for compensation for expenditure incurred on account of the war, and also for war damages, that is to say, any damages which may have been suffered by them and by their nationals in war zones on account of military measures, including all requisitions in enemy country. Both Parties likewise agree to forgo compensation for any civilian damages, which may have been suffered by the nationals of the one Party on account of so-called exceptional war measures or on account of emergency measures carried out by the other Party. [b] Legal relations in public and private matters arising out of the state of war, including the question of the treatment of trading vessels which have fallen into the hands of either Party, shall be settled on a basis of reciprocity. [c] Germany and Russia mutually agree to waive their claims for compensation for expenditure incurred by either party on behalf of prisoners of war. Furthermore, the German Government agrees to forgo compensation within regard to the expenditure incurred by it on behalf of members of the Red Army interned in Germany. The Russian Government agrees to forgo the restitution of the proceeds of the sale carried out in Germany of the army stores brought into Germany by the interned members of the Red Army mentioned above. Article 2 Germany waives all claims against Russia which may have arisen through the application, up to the present, of the laws and measures of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic to German nationals or their private rights and the rights of the German Reich and states, and also claims which may have arisen owing to any other measures taken by the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic or by their agents against German nationals or the private rights, on condition that the government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic does not satisfy claims for compensation of a similar nature made by a third Party. Article 3 Diplomatic and consular relations between the German Reich and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic shall be resumed immediately. The conditions for the admission of the Consuls of both Parties shall be determined by means of a special agreement. Article 4 Both Governments have furthermore agreed that the establishment of the legal status of those nationals of the one Party, which live within the territory of the other Party, and the general regulation of mutual, commercial and economic relations, shall be effected on the principle of the most favoured nation. This principle shall, however, not apply to the privileges and facilities which the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic may grant to a Soviet Republic or to any State which in the past formed part of the former Russian Empire. Article 5 The two Governments shall co-operate in a spirit of mutual goodwill in meeting the economic needs of both countries. In the event of a fundamental settlement of the above question on an international basis, an exchange of opinions shall previously take place between the two Governments. The German Government, having lately been informed of the proposed agreements of private firms, declares its readiness to give all possible support to these arrangements and to facilitate their being carried into effect. Article 6 Articles 1[b] and 4 of this Agreement shall come into force on the day of ratification, and the remaining provisions shall come into force immediately.

Article 2 The German Government and the Government of the Socialist Soviet Republic of the Ukraine are agreed that the determination and the settlement of such claims as may have arisen in favour either of the German Government or of the Government of the Ukraine since the conclusion of the state of war between Germany and the Ukraine during the period in which German troops were present in the Ukraine shall be reserved. Article 3 All nationals of one of the Contracting Parties who are resident on the territory of the other Party shall enjoy complete legal protection of their persons in conformity with international law and the general laws of the country of residence. Nationals of the German Reich who enter the territory of the States allied to the RSFSR in conformity with the passport regulations, or who are at present resident there, shall be granted inviolability in respect of all property taken with them and of all property acquired on the territory of the States allied with the RSFSR provided that the acquisition and employment of that property is in accordance with the laws of the State of residence or with specific agreements made with the competent authorities of that State.

Article 4 The Governments of the States allied with the RSFSR shall be entitled to establish, at places in Germany where they have diplomatic representatives or one of their consular agents, national trade offices which shall have the same legal status as the Russian trade delegation in Germany. In this case they shall recognise as binding upon themselves all legal acts performed either by the director of their trade office or by officials invested by him with full powers, provided that such officials act in accordance with the full powers granted to them. Article 5 In order to facilitate economic relations between the German Reich on the one hand, and the States allied with the RSFSR on the other hand, the following principles have been laid down: [1] All agreements concluded between nationals of the German Reich, German legal persons, or German firms on the one hand, and the Governments of the States allied with the RSFSR, or their national trade offices mentioned in Article 4, or individuals, legal persons, or firms belonging to those states, on the other hand, and also the economic effects of such agreements, shall be dealt with according to the laws of the State in which they were concluded and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of that State. This provision shall not apply to agreements which were concluded before the coming into force of the present Treaty. [2] The agreements mentioned under [1] may contain an arbitration clause. Provision may also be made in such agreements for bringing them under the jurisdiction of one of the contracting States. Article 6 The States allied with the RSFSR shall allow persons who possessed German nationality but have since lost it, and also their wives and children, to leave the country, provided that proof is forthcoming that they are transferring their residence to Germany. Article 7 The delegations of both Parties and all persons employed in connection therewith shall refrain from any agitation or propaganda against the Government and national institutions of the country in which they reside. Article 8 This Treaty may, as regards the above Articles 3 to 6, and also as regards the corresponding application of Article 4 of the Treaty of Rapallo, be denounced on three months notice being given. Such denunciation may be notified by Germany to any one of the States allied with the RSFSR to take effect only for her relations with that State and, conversely, by any one of these States to Germany, to take effect only for relations between that single State and Germany.

The members of the commission shall be regarded as representatives of a nondiplomatic character and shall liquidate all transactions at the latest within six months after the expiry of this Treaty. Article 9 This Treaty shall be ratified. Special instruments of ratification shall be exchanged between Germany on the one hand, and each one of the States allied with the RSFSR on the other hand.

Its route network focused on the East Coast of the United States, but it also extended to the West Coast. The route network was based at Washington Dulles International Airport. It ceased all operations at 8:24 p.m. UTC-5 on January 5, 2006. The airline had been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since November 7, 2005. There had been discussion of a last-minute deal that could save the airline, but that did not happen. History A regional jet operated by Independence Air, seen through terminal windows Independence Air started life as Atlantic Coast Airlines on December 15, 1989, operating feeder services as United Express for United Airlines and Delta Connection for Delta Air Lines. After United withdrew the contract when the ACA labor and management would not agree to the concessions it requested, Atlantic Coast reinvented itself as low-cost carrier Independence Air. It was announced on November 19, 2003, and operations as Independence Air began on June 16, 2004. At its inception, it was unique among low-cost carriers in that its fleet mainly consisted of 50-seat regional jets, although the airline later introduced larger Airbus A319 equipment. It was based at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) and contributed to Dulles's substantial increase in passenger use, bringing one million new customers to the airport in its first three months of operation. The airline was also credited with helping to reduce fares to and from the airport. =Criticism= From the beginning, the airline faced criticism. Some believed that it expanded too quickly, had a poor fleet mix and did not have the resources to compete with the legacy airlines, who despite their own financial troubles, would match the fares offered by Independence. Further, industry experts believed that the reasons behind the airline's failure were not problems with the low-cost strategy, but miscues on the part of airline management. Atlantic Coast's / Independence Air's former partner at Dulles, United Airlines, responded vigorously to Independence Air's emergence as a stand-alone carrier by leveraging Washington area passenger loyalty to the United Mileage Plus frequent flyer program. United offered its Mileage Plus members substantial bonuses, including free trips around the world on United and other Star Alliance carriers; these proved effective in maintaining United's grip on the lucrative business travel market, and Independence Air was unable to respond to United's promotional onslaught. (United's primary offer for free flights based on a sliding scale of flight segments to/from a Washington airport - IAD, DCA, BWI. 24 segments yielded a United coach ticket, 48 segments yielded a Star Alliance round-the-world business class ticket.) Problems, including flights flying far below capacity, were identified in October 2004, less than six months following the airline's launch as the parent company attempted to avoid bankruptcy. =Promotional activities= Sterling On May 20, 2004, even prior to its inaugural flight, Independence Air signed a deal with the Washington Redskins to become the official airline sponsor of the team for three years. In the summer of 2005, the airline offered the GLiDE Summer Travel Pass for college students. Upon paying $250, the customer would be able to fly at no cost (after paying taxes & airport fees) from May 1-Aug 31, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays & Saturdays. This move was meant not to bring in revenue, but to try to fill seats that otherwise would have flown empty. This promotional tool was not enough to prevent trouble, due in part to the airline losing almost $150 million in its two years of operation. Independence Air became quickly known for the humorous touches it added to the flying experience, such as replacing the flight attendant safety announcements with prerecorded versions of the warnings by celebrities such as James Carville and Mary Matalin. They also attracted attention from their partnership with the Laugh Factory and the use of former baggage handler Dave George as \\"the Flyi Guy\\" -- the airline's resident comedian. Independence Air also invested in a fleet of 20 promotional vehicles, dubbed \\"Jet Trucks\\". Modified pickup trucks were painted in the airline's livery and featured an aircraft tail attached to the truck's bed. Jet Trucks were featured at all promotional events and activities, where employees would hand out information and branded giveaways. Rather than having these vehicles sit in the headquarters office parking lot between events, 10 trucks were allocated for employee use to increase public exposure. Corporate affairs =Headquarters= Independence Air had its headquarters in Loudoun Gateway III in the Loudoun Gateway Corporate Center in Dulles, unincorporated Loudoun County, Virginia.\\"ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.\\" Independence Air.

From the airline's beginning, its fleet mix was cited as one of the causes of its financial troubles. Independence Air's fleet ebbed and flowed in an attempt to stay in business. In February 2005, the airline canceled the lease on more than 20 Bombardier CRJ200 jets and British Aerospace Jetstream 41 turbo-prop planes. = Historical fleet= Independence Air previously operated the following aircraft: * 12 Airbus A319 * 87 Bombardier CRJ200 * 31 Dornier 328 Decline After its emergence as an independent brand name, Independence Air became known for offering very low airfares: as little as $29 one-way to Florida from Washington Dulles International Airport. However, the company never overcame a series of financial problems during its transition, and its decline started only six months after its launch. In February 2005, one of its aircraft was repossessed after the company missed a lease payment, after trying and failing to restructure the lease. Later that year, three more aircraft were sold or repossessed and in November 2005, FLYi, Inc., their parent company, declared bankruptcy. The company cited rising costs in the airline industry as the reason its low-cost strategy did not succeed. In the intervening months between FLY I's declaration of bankruptcy and Independence Air's cessation of operations, a number of airlines expressed an interest in acquiring the airline's assets including: Mesa Air Group, United Airlines and Richard Branson. Not finding a suitable buyer in time to keep the planes flying, Independence Air announced on January 2, 2006, that it would cease operations at 7:26 p.m. UTC-5 on January 5, 2006 following a flight from Westchester County Airport in New York. When the airline ceased operations, it employed more than 2,500 staff, many of whom had been with the airline since its inception as Atlantic Coast Airlines. Over its 18 months of operation, Independence carried more than 8 million passengers.

It also stated that Germany would never go to war with the other countries. Locarno divided borders in Europe into two categories: western, which were guaranteed by Locarno treaties, and eastern borders of Germany with Poland, which were open for revision. Planning the treaties German foreign minister Gustav Stresemann made his highest priority the restoration of German prestige and privileges as a leading European nation. French withdrawal from the Occupation of the Ruhr was scheduled for January 1925, but Stresemann sensed that France was very nervous about its security and might cancel the withdrawal. Having realized that France deeply desired a British guarantee of its postwar borders, but that London was reluctant, Stresemann came up with a plan whereby all sides would get what they wanted: through a series of treaties that promised these guarantees. Upon hearing this proposal, British Foreign Minister Austen Chamberlain enthusiastically agreed. France realized that its occupation of the Ruhr had caused much financial and diplomatic damage. The foreign ministers then convened in the Swiss resort of Locarno in October 1925, where they came to an agreement on the treaties. The first treaty was the most critical: a mutual guarantee of the frontiers of Belgium, France, and Germany, guaranteed by Britain and Italy. The second and third treaties called for arbitration between Germany and Belgium, and Germany and France, regarding future disputes. The fourth and fifth were similar arbitration treaties between Germany and Poland, and Germany and Czechoslovakia. Poland especially, and Czechoslovakia as well, felt threatened by the Locarno agreements and these treaties were an attempt to reassure them. Thanks to the Dawes Plan, Germany was now making regular reparations payments. The success of the Locarno agreements led to the admission of Germany to the League of Nations in September 1926, with a seat on its council as a permanent member.Norman Rich, Great Power Diplomacy since 1914 (2003) pp 148‚Äì49. Goals  For the British government, the main goals were promoting Franco-German reconciliation, and the expectation that reconciliation would lead to France dissolving its Cordon sanitaire, as the French alliance system in Eastern Europe was known between the wars.Stephen Schuker, ‚ÄúThe End of Versailles‚Äù pages 38‚Äì56 in Gordon Martel, ed. The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered (1999) pp 48‚Äì49. If France were to dissolve its alliances in Eastern Europe, Poland would peacefully hand over the territories ceded by Germany in the Versailles Peace Treaty: the Polish Corridor, the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) and Upper Silesia.Schuker, ‚ÄúThe End of Versailles‚Äù in The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered pp 48‚Äì49; J W Bruegel, \\"German Diplomacy and the Sudeten Question before 1938\\" in International Affairs vol. 37 no. 3 (Jul 1961): 323-326, discusses the lack of German revisionism towards German-speaking Czechoslovakia in the 1920s. Parties and agreement The principal treaty concluded at Locarno was the Rhineland Pact between Germany, France, Belgium, Great Britain, and Italy. Germany formally recognised its new western borders acted by the Treaty of Versailles. Furthermore, the first three signatories undertook not to attack each other, with the latter two acting as guarantors. In the event of aggression by any of the first three states against another, all other parties were to assist the country under attack.Jon Jacobson, Locarno diplomacy: Germany and the west, 1925‚Äì1929 (2015) Germany also agreed to sign arbitration conventions with France and Belgium and arbitration treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, undertaking to refer future disputes to an arbitration tribunal or to the Permanent Court of International Justice. France signed further treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, pledging mutual assistance in the event of conflict with Germany. These essentially reaffirmed existing treaties of alliance concluded by France with Poland on 19 February 1921 and with Czechoslovakia on 25 January 1924. These treaties also showed that relations between France and Germany had not improved to a large extent. Effect The Locarno Treaties marked a dramatic improvement in the political climate of western Europe in 1925‚Äì1930. They promoted expectations for continued peaceful settlements, often called the \\"spirit of Locarno\\". This spirit was made concrete when Germany joined the League in 1926, and the withdrawal of Allied troops occupying Germany's Rhineland. The Nobel Peace Prize was given to the lead negotiators of the treaty, going to Sir Austen Chamberlain in 1925 and jointly to Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann in 1926. Historian Sally Marks says: Hitler repudiated Locarno by sending troops into the demilitarized Rhineland on 7 March 1936. =Anger in Poland= In Poland, the public humiliation received by Polish diplomats was one of the contributing factors to the fall of the Grabski cabinet. Locarno contributed to the worsening of the atmosphere between Poland and France, weakening the French-Polish alliance. J√≥zef Beck ridiculed the treaties saying, \\"Germany was officially asked to attack the east, in return for peace in the west.\\" J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski would say that \\"every honest Pole spits when he hears this word [Locarno]\\".Piotr Wandycz, France and Her Eastern Allies 1919‚Äì1925: French- Czechoslovak-Polish Relations from the Paris Peace Conference to Locarno (1962). Proposals in 1934 for an \\"eastern Locarno\\" pact securing Germany's eastern frontiers foundered on German opposition and on Poland's insistence that its eastern borders should be covered by a western guarantee of her borders. The Locarno treaty was heavily undermined by the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance on 2 May 1935, which the German government claimed was a violation of its \\"spirit\\".

He is the founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society and used to be a senior research fellow at the Center for Inquiry, focusing on Quranic criticism. Warraq is the Vice-President of the World Encounter Institute. Warraq has written historiographies of the early centuries of the Islamic timeline and has published works which question mainstream conceptions of the period. The pen name Ibn Warraq (, most literally \\"son of a papermaker\\") is used due to his concerns for his personal safety; Warraq stated, \\"I was afraid of becoming the second Salman Rushdie.\\" It is a name that has been adopted by dissident authors throughout the history of Islam. The name refers to the 9th-century skeptical scholar Abu Isa al- Warraq. Warraq adopted the pseudonym in 1995 when he completed his first book, entitled Why I Am Not a Muslim. Warraq's commentary on Islam has been criticized by academic specialists in Islamic history as polemical, overly revisionist and lacking in expertise,Dutton, Y. (2000) Review: The Origins of the Koran: Classic Essays on Islam's Holy Book. Journal of Islamic Studies. while others praised it as refreshing, well-researched, and mostly accurate.Daniel Pipes, \\"Why I Am Not a Muslim,\\" Weekly Standard, January 22, 1996 pg1 \\"Ibn Warraq brings a scholarly sledge-hammer to the task of demolishing Islam. Writing a polemic against Islam, especially for an author of Muslim birth, is an act so incendiary that the author must write under a pseudonym; not to do so would be an act of suicide. And what does Ibn Warraq have to show for this act of unheard-of defiance? A well-researched and quite brilliant, if somewhat disorganized, indictment of one of the world's great religions. While the author disclaims any pretense to originality, he has read widely enough to write an essay that offers a startlingly novel rendering of the faith he left.\\" He is the author of nine books, including The Origins of the Koran (1998), The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (2000), What the Koran Really Says: Language, Text and Commentary (2002), Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism (2007), Which Koran?: Variants, Manuscripts, and the Influence of Pre-Islamic Poetry (2008), Why the West Is Best: A Muslim Apostate's Defense of Liberal Democracy (2011) and Sir Walter Scott's Crusades & Other Fantasies (2013). Early life and education Warraq was born in Rajkot, Gujarat in British India and his family migrated to the newly independent Pakistan in 1947. His family were of Kutchi origin. His mother died when he was an infant. He stated in an interview that he \\"studied Arabic and read the Qur'an as a young man in hopes of becoming a follower of the Islamic faith.\\" His father decided to send him to a boarding school in England partly to circumvent a grandmother's effort to push an exclusively religious education on his son at the local Madrasa. After his arrival in Britain, he only saw his father once more, when he was 14. His father died two years later. Warraq claims to have been \\"shy\\" for most of his youth. By 19 he had moved to Scotland to pursue his education at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied philosophy and Arabic with Islamic studies scholar W. Montgomery Watt.Priya Abraham, \\"Dissident voices,\\" World Magazine, Vol. 22, No. 22, June 16, 2007 (accessed January 1, 2014; archive available at ) After graduating, Warraq was a primary school teacher in London for five years and moved to France with his wife in 1982, opening an Indian restaurant. He also worked as a courier for a travel agent. Writing and works During the Rushdie affair, Ibn Warraq noticed there were frequent critical attacks on Christianity and Judaism, but never on Islam, which ‚Äì according to Warraq ‚Äì tries to control every single aspect of an individual's life, giving \\"no scope for independent thinking.\\" He expected various intellectuals in the West to defend Rushdie and values like freedom of expression, but \\"instead of defending Rushdie and his right to freedom of expression, they condemned him; they were blaming the victim.\\" Because of this, Warraq began to write for Free Inquiry Magazine, the American secular humanist publication, on topics such as \\"Why I am not Muslim.\\" \\"The sovereignty in Islam,\\" said Warraq in a 2006 interview, \\"lies with God, whereas in human rights, in democracy, for example, the sovereignty lies with people. And, the human rights, the universal declaration of human rights, on several occasions, clashes with various aspects of Islamic law, especially in the treatment of women and non-Muslims.\\" In addition, Warraq expressed concerns about freedom of religion: \\"In Islam, you don't have the right to leave your religion. You're born a Muslim and that's it. An apostasy, that is to say, leaving your religion in Islam, is punishable by death.\\" Ibn Warraq continued writing with several works examining the historiography of the Qur'an and Muhammad. Other books treated the topic of secular humanist values among Muslims. In The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam's Holy Book, Ibn Warraq includes some of Theodor N√∂ldeke's studies. In 2005, Warraq spent several months working with Christoph Luxenberg, who wrote about Syriac vs. Arabic interpretation of Koranic verse.Center for Inquiry Volume 9 Issue 5, July 2005. Qu'ranic \\"scholar Christoph Luxenberg has tried to demonstrate that many of the obscurities of the Qu'ran disappear if we read certain words as being Syriac and not Arabic. This would include, for example, reinterpreting the promise of virgins in the afterlife as a promise for chilled drinks and good food. Luxenberg's work has been well received among Islamic scholars, and the esteemed critic Ibn Warraq regards it as the most important book ever written on the Qu'ran. In a series of three lectures, Warraq, who has spent several months working with Luxenberg, will give a summary of Luxenberg's research.\\" In February 2006, he participated with several other specialists at the Pim Fortuyn Memorial Conference on Islam in The Hague (17‚Äì19 February 2006).Pim Fortuyn Memorial Conference on Islam in The Hague on Militant Islam Monitor.Pim Fortuyn Memorial Conference on Islam in The Hague on The Brussels Journal. In March 2006, a letter he co-signed entitled MANIFESTO: Together facing the new totalitarianism with eleven other individuals (most notably Salman Rushdie) was published in response to violent and deadly protests in the Islamic world surrounding the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. Although he does not subscribe to any particular religion, he has a higher opinion of humanism than of Islam.Why I am not a Muslim, p. 116‚Äì23 He is the founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society (ISIS). Despite his criticisms of Islam, he does not take the view that it cannot be reformed; and he works with liberal Muslims in his group. He has described himself as an atheist or an agnostic. Shortly after the 9/11, George W. Bush's speechwriter David Frum, known for coining the term Axis of Evil, hosted Ibn Warraq at an hour-and-a-half lunch at the White House. Warraq's op- ed pieces have appeared in The Wall Street Journal and The Guardian in London, and he has addressed governmental bodies all over the world, including the United Nations in Geneva.THe Campus enquirer Volume 10, Issue 2 March 2006. Prior to 2007, Ibn Warraq refused to show his face in public. This was due to fears for his personal safety and also due to his desire to travel to see his family in Pakistan without being denied access to Muslim-majority countries due to his criticism of Islam. His face was blacked out on the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society's website. In 2007, he participated in St Petersburg Secular Islam Summit along with other thinkers such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Wafa Sultan, and Irshad Manji. The group released the St Petersburg Declaration, which urges world governments to, among other things, reject Sharia law, fatwa courts, clerical rule, and state-sanctioned religion in all their forms; and to oppose all penalties for blasphemy and apostasy, which they believe to be in violation of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In October 2007, Warraq participated in the IQ2 debates in London with Douglas Murray, David Aaronovitch, Tariq Ramadan, William Dalrymple, and Charles Glass. Reception =Praise= In a 1996 review of Why I Am Not a Muslim, Daniel Pipes wrote that \\"With few exceptions, he [Warraq] relies almost entirely on the Western tradition of Islamic studies\\" but concluded that \\"Despite his anger, 'Ibn Warraq' has written a serious and thought-provoking book\\" calling for \\"an equally compelling response from a believing Muslim.\\"Daniel Pipes, \\"Why I Am Not a Muslim,\\" Middle East Quarterly, Vol. III, Num. 1, March 1996 Pipes also described Why I am not a Muslim (1995) as \\"well-researched and quite brilliant.\\" David Pryce-Jones said that it was \\"a scrupulously documented examination of the life and teaching of the Prophet Muhammad, of the Qur'an and its sources, and the resulting culture.\\"David Pryce-Jones \\"Enough Said,\\" The New Criterion, January 2008 Christopher Hitchens described Why I Am Not a Muslim as his \\"favorite book on Islam.\\"Christopher Hitchens, \\"Holy Writ,\\" The Atlantic, April 1, 2003. In 2007, Douglas Murray described Ibn Warraq as: In a 2008 review of Ibn Warraq's book, Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism, political scientist Peter Berkowitz described Warraq as a \\"worthy critic\\" for Edward Said. Berkowitz said that \\"with a rare combination of polemical zest and prodigious learning, it [Defending the West] is the first [book-length critique] to address and refute Said's arguments 'against the background of a more general presentation of salient aspects of Western civilization.'\\"Peter Berkowitz, \\"Answering Edward Said: Peter Berkowitz on Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism by Ibn Warraq,\\" Policy Review number 149, June 2, 2008. In a 2009 review of Defending the West A. J. Caschetta concluded that \\"Ibn Warraq's critique of Said's thought and work is thorough and convincing, indeed devastating to anyone depending on Saidism. It should do to Orientalism what Mary Lefkowitz's Not Out of Africa did to Martin Bernal's Black Athena.\\"A. J. Caschetta, \\"Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism,\\" Middle East Quarterly, Vol. XVI, Num. 1, Winter 2009 Pryce-Jones said that it \\"demolishes in close detail the Saidian 'narrative.'\\" In a 2012 review of Ibn Warraq's book, Virgins? What Virgins, Rice University historian of Islam David Cook wrote: \\"As a scholar of Islam myself, I find Ibn Warraq's attitude to be very refreshing, and his scholarship for the most part to be accurate and devastating in pinpointing the weaknesses in Muslim orthodoxy.\\" The book's third essay, Cook continues, \\"could almost serve as a history of our field, and of its systematic failure to critique the foundational texts of Islam as those of other faiths have been critiqued.\\"David Cook, \\"Ibn Warraq. Virgins? What Virgins? and Other Essays\\" in Reason Papers: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Normative Studies, vol. 34, no. 2 (October 2012), p. 235 =Criticism= In reviewing Ibn Warraq's compilation The Origins of the Koran, religious studies professor Herbert Berg has labelled him as \\"polemical and inconsistent\\" in his writing. Berg lauded the inclusion of the essay by Theodor N√∂ldeke, but panned the inclusion of William St. Clair Tisdall's as \\"not a particularly scholarly essay\\". He concluded \\"[i]t seems that Ibn Warraq has included some of the essays not on the basis of their scholarly value or their status as 'classics', but rather on the basis of their hostility to Islam. This does not necessarily diminish the value of the collection, but the reader should be aware that this collection does not fully represent classic scholarship on the Quran.\\" In reviewing Ibn Warraq's essay in his Quest for the Historical Muhammad (2001) Fred Donner, a professor in Near Eastern studies, notes his lack of specialist training in Arabic studies, citing \\"inconsistent handling of Arabic materials,\\" and unoriginal arguments, and \\"heavy-handed favoritism\\" towards revisionist theories and \\"the compiler's [i.e. Ibn Warraq's] agenda, which is not scholarship, but anti-Islamic polemic.\\"Donner, Fred. (2001) Review: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad . Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, University of Chicago. Anthropologist and historian Daniel Martin Varisco has criticized Ibn Warraq's book Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism, writing that \\"This modern son of a bookseller imprints a polemical farce not worth the 500-plus pages of paper it wastes.\\" His work, \\"The Origins of the Koran\\", is itself based on a polemic by St. Clair Tisdall \\"The original sources of the Qur'an\\" which was described by Fran√ßois de Blois as a \\"decidedly shoddy piece of missionary propaganda\\". Fran√ßois de Blois in reviewing The origins of the Koran, states that \\"it is surprising that the editor, who in his Why I am not a Muslim took a very high posture as a critical rationalist and opponent of all forms of obscurantism, now relies so heavily on writings by Christian polemicists from the nineteenth century\\". Asma Afsaruddin states that \\"Ibn Warraq is not interested in debate; he wants nothing less than wholesale conversion to his point of view within the community of scholars of Islam\\" and added that his work, The Origins of The Koran, \\"needlessly poisons the atmosphere and stymies efforts to engage in honest scholarly discussion\\".

The experiments were created to argue the idea of a rotating Earth as opposed to a stationary Earth around which rotated the Sun and planets and stars. An argument that was used at the time was that if the earth were rotating, there would be detectable effects on the trajectories of projectiles or falling bodies. Ship's mast experiment In 1616, after Galileo had already become concerned that he was a target of suspicion by the Inquisition, he received a letter from Monsignor Francesco Ingoli listing both scientific and theological arguments against Copernicanism. As part of a lengthy 1624 reply, Galileo described the experiment of dropping a rock from the mast of a smoothly moving ship, and observing whether the rock hit at the base of the mast or behind it. Various people had discussed the experiment in theoretical terms, and some claimed to have done it, with conflicting reports as to the result. For example, actual or thought experiments similar to this one had been previously discussed by Jean Buridan,Questions on Aristotle‚Äôs On the Heavens. Cambridge (Mass.), Medieval Academy of America (English translation by E.A. Moody of the c. 1340 Latin original) Nicolas Oresme,Le livre du Ciel et du Monde. Book II, Chapter 25 (manuscript). Paris, National Library. Nicolaus Cusanus,On Learned Ignorance. Minneapolis, The Arthur J. Banning Press (English translation by J. Hopkins of the 1440 Latin original). ClaviusIn sphaeram ioannis de sacro bosco commentarius, p. 196, \\"Neque enim valet responsio quorundam...\\" and Giordano Bruno.La Cena delle Ceneri, III, 5. Galileo told Ingoli (translated by Stillman Drake): > I have been twice as good a philosopher as those others because they, in > saying what is the opposite of the effect, have also added the lie of their > having seen this by experiment; and I have made the experiment -- before > which, physical reasoning had persuaded me that the effect must turn out as > it indeed does. The experiment is also discussed in the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (day two), but without any assertion that it was actually carried out. A similar experiment discussed by Galileo and other authors such as Oresme, Clavius and Bruno is one in which a projectile is launched straight up from the surface of the earth. A common Aristotelian-Scholastic argument was that if the earth's surface were moving to the east, then in this experiment the projectile would land to the west of the launching point, contrary to observation. 1632 thought experiment Galileo's 1632 book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems considered (the Second Day) all the common arguments then current against the idea that the Earth moves. One of these is that if the Earth were spinning on its axis, then we would all be moving to the East at hundreds of miles an hour so a ball dropped straight down from a tower would land West of the tower which would have moved some distance East in the interim. Similarly, the argument went, a cannonball fired to the East would land closer to the cannon than one fired to the West because the cannon moving East would partly catch up with the ball. To counter such arguments the book observes that a person on a uniformly moving ship has no sense of movement and so a cannonball dropped from the top of the mast would fall directly to the foot. To prove the point Galileo's fictional advocate Salviati proposed the experiment described below to show the classical principle of relativity according to which there is no internal observation (i.e. without, as it were, looking out the window) by which one can distinguish between a system moving uniformly from one at rest. Hence, any two systems moving without acceleration are equivalent, and unaccelerated motion is relative. Nearly three centuries later, this notion was applied to the laws of electricity and magnetism (Maxwell's equations) by Albert Einstein. This led to the formulation of the special theory of relativity, a restatement of Galileo's argument with the then-known laws of gravitation and electromagnetism taken into account. =The proposal= Salviati's experiment goes as follows: > Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some > large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small > flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a > bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the > ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal > speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all > directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing > something to your friend, you need throw it no more strongly in one > direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet > together, you pass equal spaces in every direction. When you have observed > all these things carefully (though doubtless when the ship is standing still > everything must happen in this way), have the ship proceed with any speed > you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not fluctuating this way and > that. You will discover not the least change in all the effects named, nor > could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing > still. In jumping, you will pass on the floor the same spaces as before, nor > will you make larger jumps toward the stern than toward the prow even though > the ship is moving quite rapidly, despite the fact that during the time that > you are in the air the floor under you will be going in a direction opposite > to your jump. In throwing something to your companion, you will need no more > force to get it to him whether he is in the direction of the bow or the > stern, with yourself situated opposite. The droplets will fall as before > into the vessel beneath without dropping toward the stern, although while > the drops are in the air the ship runs many spans. The fish in their water > will swim toward the front of their bowl with no more effort than toward the > back, and will go with equal ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges > of the bowl. Finally the butterflies and flies will continue their flights > indifferently toward every side, nor will it ever happen that they are > concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out from keeping up with the > course of the ship, from which they will have been separated during long > intervals by keeping themselves in the air. And if smoke is made by burning > some incense, it will be seen going up in the form of a little cloud, > remaining still and moving no more toward one side than the other. The cause > of all these correspondences of effects is the fact that the ship's motion > is common to all the things contained in it, and to the air also. That is > why I said you should be below decks; for if this took place above in the > open air, which would not follow the course of the ship, more or less > noticeable differences would be seen in some of the effects noted. :Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, translated by Stillman Drake, University of California Press, 1953, pp. 186 - 187 (Second Day).

Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro-level analysis of society. Karl Marx is regarded as the father of social conflict theory, which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology. Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought. While many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory does not refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, peace and conflict studies, or any other specific theory of social conflict.  In classical sociology  Of the classical founders of social science, conflict theory is most commonly associated with Karl Marx (1818‚Äì1883). Based on a dialectical materialist account of history, Marxism posited that capitalism, like previous socioeconomic systems, would inevitably produce internal tensions leading to its own destruction. Marx ushered in radical change, advocating proletarian revolution and freedom from the ruling classes. At the same time, Karl Marx was aware that most of the people living in capitalist societies did not see how the system shaped the entire operation of society. Just as modern individuals see private property (and the right to pass that property on to their children) as natural, many of the members in capitalistic societies see the rich as having earned their wealth through hard work and education, while seeing the poor as lacking in skill and initiative. Marx rejected this type of thinking and termed it false consciousness, the use of misdirection by the ruling class to obfuscate the exploitation intrinsic to the relationship between the proletariat and the ruling class. Marx wanted to replace this false consciousness with something Friedrich Engels termed class consciousness, the workers' recognition of themselves as a class unified in opposition to capitalists and ultimately to the capitalist system itself. In general, Marx wanted the proletarians to rise up against the capitalists and overthrow the capitalist system. Two early conflict theorists were the Polish- Austrian sociologist and political theorist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838‚Äì1909) and the American sociologist and paleontologist Lester F. Ward (1841‚Äì1913). Although Ward and Gumplowicz developed their theories independently they had much in common and approached conflict from a comprehensive anthropological and evolutionary point-of-view as opposed to Marx's rather exclusive focus on economic factors. Gumplowicz, in Grundriss der Soziologie (Outlines of Sociology, 1884), describes how civilization has been shaped by conflict between cultures and ethnic groups. Gumplowicz theorized that large complex human societies evolved from the war and conquest. The winner of a war would enslave the losers; eventually a complex caste system develops.Fifty Key Sociologists: the Formative Theorists, John Scott Irving, 2007, pg 59 Horowitz says that Gumplowicz understood conflict in all its forms: \\"class conflict, race conflict and ethnic conflict\\", and calls him one of the fathers of conflict theory.\\"Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing\\", Irving Louis Horowitz, 1986, pg 281 Ward directly attacked and attempted to systematically refute the elite business class' laissez-faire philosophy as espoused by the hugely popular social philosopher Herbert Spencer. Ward's Dynamic Sociology (1883) was an extended thesis on how to reduce conflict and competition in society and thus optimize human progress. At the most basic level Ward saw human nature itself to be deeply conflicted between self- and altruism, between emotion and intellect, and between male and female. These conflicts would be then reflected in society and Ward assumed there had been a \\"perpetual and vigorous struggle\\" among various \\"social forces\\" that shaped civilization.\\"Transforming Leadership\\", James MacGregor Burns, 2004, pg 189\\"German Realpolitik and American Sociology: an Inquiry Into the Sources and Political Significance of the Sociology of Conflict\\", James Alfred Aho, 1975, ch. 6 'Lester F. Ward's Sociology of Conflict' Ward was more optimistic than Marx and Gumplowicz and believed that it was possible to build on and reform present social structures with the help of sociological analysis. √âmile Durkheim (1858‚Äì1917) saw society as a functioning organism. Functionalism concerns \\"the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system,\\"Bourricaud, F. 'The Sociology of Talcott Parsons' Chicago University Press. . p. 94 The chief form of social conflict that Durkheim addressed was crime. Durkheim saw crime as \\"a factor in public health, an integral part of all healthy societies.\\"Durkheim, E. (1938). The Rules of Sociological Method. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. p. 67. The collective conscience defines certain acts as \\"criminal.\\" Crime thus plays a role in the evolution of morality and law: \\"[it] implies not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes.\\"Durkheim, (1938), pp. 70‚Äì81. Max Weber's (1864‚Äì1920) approach to conflict is contrasted with that of Marx. While Marx focused on the way individual behaviour is conditioned by social structure, Weber emphasized the importance of \\"social action,\\" i.e., the ability of individuals to affect their social relationships.Livesay, C. Social Inequality: Theories: Weber. Sociology Central. A-Level Sociology Teaching Notes. Retrieved on: 2010-06-20.  Modern approaches  C. Wright Mills has been called the founder of modern conflict theory.Knapp, P. (1994). One World ‚Äì Many Worlds: Contemporary Sociological Theory (2nd Ed.). Harpercollins College Div, pp. 228‚Äì246. Online summary In Mills's view, social structures are created through conflict between people with differing interests and resources. Individuals and resources, in turn, are influenced by these structures and by the \\"unequal distribution of power and resources in the society.\\" The power elite of American society, (i.e., the military‚Äìindustrial complex) had \\"emerged from the fusion of the corporate elite, the Pentagon, and the executive branch of government.\\" Mills argued that the interests of this elite were opposed to those of the people. He theorized that the policies of the power elite would result in \\"increased escalation of conflict, production of weapons of mass destruction, and possibly the annihilation of the human race.\\" Gene Sharp (1928-2018) was a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. He is known for his extensive writings on nonviolent struggle, which have influenced numerous anti-government resistance movements around the world. In 1983 he founded the Albert Einstein Institution, a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide.Gene Sharp biography at Albert Einstein Institution web site. Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state‚Äîregardless of its particular structural organization‚Äîultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler or rulers. If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power. Sharp has been called both the \\"Machiavelli of nonviolence\\" and the \\"Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare.\\"Weber, Thomas. Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2004 Sharp's scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. More recently, the protest movement that toppled President Mubarak of Egypt drew extensively on his ideas, as well as the youth movement in Tunisia, and the earlier ones in the Eastern European colour revolutions that had previously been inspired by Sharp's work. A recent articulation of conflict theory is found in Canadian sociologist Alan Sears' book A Good Book, in Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking (2008):Sears, Alan. (2008) A Good Book, In Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking. North York: Higher Education University of Toronto Press, pg. 34-6, . * Societies are defined by inequality that produces conflict, rather than which produces order and consensus. This conflict based on inequality can only be overcome through a fundamental transformation of the existing relations in the society, and is productive of new social relations. * The disadvantaged have structural interests that run counter to the status quo, which, once they are assumed, will lead to social change. Thus, they are viewed as agents of change rather than objects one should feel sympathy for. * Human potential (e.g., capacity for creativity) is suppressed by conditions of exploitation and oppression, which are necessary in any society with an unequal division of labour. These and other qualities do not necessarily have to be stunted due to the requirements of the so-called \\"civilizing process,\\" or \\"functional necessity\\": creativity is actually an engine for economic development and change. * The role of theory is in realizing human potential and transforming society, rather than maintaining the power structure. The opposite aim of theory would be the objectivity and detachment associated with positivism, where theory is a neutral, explanatory tool. * Consensus is a euphemism for ideology. Genuine consensus is not achieved, rather the more powerful in societies are able to impose their conceptions on others and have them accept their discourses. Consensus does not preserve social order, it entrenches stratification, a tool of the current social order. * The State serves the particular interests of the most powerful while claiming to represent the interests of all. Representation of disadvantaged groups in State processes may cultivate the notion of full participation, but this is an illusion/ideology. * Inequality on a global level is characterized by the purposeful underdevelopment of Third World countries, both during colonization and after national independence. The global system (i.e., development agencies such as World Bank and International Monetary Fund) benefits the most powerful countries and multi-national corporations, rather than the subjects of development, through economic, political, and military actions. Although Sears associates the conflict theory approach with Marxism, he argues that it is the foundation for much \\"feminist, post-modernist, anti-racist, and lesbian-gay liberationist theories.\\"Sears, pg. 36. Conflict theory has three assumptions:Hamon, Raeann R. \\"Conflict Theory.\\" Encyclopedia of Family Studies (2016): 1-5. * Humans are self- interested. * Societies operate under perpetual scarcity of resources. * Conflict is pervasive and unavoidable within social groups and between social groups. Types Conflict theory is most commonly associated with Marxism, but as a reaction to functionalism and the positivist method, it may also be associated with a number of other perspectives, including: * Critical theory * Feminist theory: An approach that recognizes women's political, social, and economic equality to men. * Postmodern theory: An approach that is critical of modernism, with a mistrust of grand theories and ideologies.Macionis, J., and Gerber, L.

Drawn up by the 1646 Westminster Assembly as part of the Westminster Standards to be a confession of the Church of England, it became and remains the \\"subordinate standard\\" of doctrine in the Church of Scotland and has been influential within Presbyterian churches worldwide. In 1643, the English Parliament called upon \\"learned, godly and judicious Divines\\" to meet at Westminster Abbey in order to provide advice on issues of worship, doctrine, government and discipline of the Church of England. Their meetings, over a period of five years, produced the confession of faith, as well as a Larger Catechism and a Shorter Catechism. For more than three hundred years, various churches around the world have adopted the confession and the catechisms as their standards of doctrine, subordinate to the Bible. The Westminster Confession of Faith was modified and adopted by Congregationalists in England in the form of the Savoy Declaration (1658). Likewise, the Baptists of England modified the Savoy Declaration to produce the Second London Baptist Confession (1689). English Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists would together (with others) come to be known as Nonconformists, because they did not conform to the Act of Uniformity (1662) establishing the Church of England as the only legally approved church, though they were in many ways united by their common confessions, built on the Westminster Confession. Historical situation The Assertion of Liberty of Conscience by the Independents at the Westminster Assembly of Divines, painted by John Rogers Herbert, During the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1649), the English Parliament raised armies in an alliance with the Covenanters who by then were the de facto government of Scotland, against the forces of Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland. The purpose of the Westminster Assembly, in which 121 Puritan clergymen participated, was to provide official documents for the reformation of the Church of England. The Church of Scotland had recently overthrown the bishops imposed by the King and reinstated presbyterianism (see Bishops' Wars). For this reason, as a condition for entering into the alliance with the English Parliament, the Scottish Parliament formed the Solemn League and Covenant with the English Parliament, which meant that the Church of England would abandon episcopalianism and consistently adhere to Calvinistic standards of doctrine and worship. The Confession and Catechisms were produced in order to secure the help of the Scots against the king. The Scottish Commissioners who were present at the Assembly were satisfied with the Confession of Faith, and in 1646, the document was sent to the English parliament to be ratified, and submitted to the General Assembly of the Scottish Kirk. The Church of Scotland adopted the document, without amendment, in 1647. In England, the House of Commons returned the document to the Assembly with the requirement to compile a list of proof texts from Scripture. After vigorous debate, the Confession was then in part adopted as the Articles of Christian Religion in 1648, by act of the English parliament, omitting section 4 of chapter 20 (Of Christian Liberty), sections 4‚Äì6 of chapter 24 (Of Marriage and Divorce), and chapters 30 and 31 (Of Church Censures and Of Synods and Councils). The next year, the Scottish parliament ratified the Confession without amendment. In 1660, the Restoration of the British monarchy and Anglican episcopacy resulted in the nullification of these acts of the two parliaments. However, when William of Orange replaced the Roman Catholic King James VII of Scotland and II of England on the thrones of Scotland, England and Ireland, he gave royal assent to the Scottish parliament's ratification of the Confession, again without change, in 1690. Contents The confession is a systematic exposition of Calvinist orthodoxy (which neo-orthodox scholars refer to as \\"scholastic Calvinism\\"), influenced by Puritan and covenant theology. It includes doctrines common to most of Christendom such as the Trinity and Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection, and it contains doctrines specific to Protestantism such as sola scriptura and sola fide. Its more controversial features include the covenant of works with Adam, the Puritan doctrine that assurance of salvation is not a necessary consequence of faith, a minimalist conception of worship, and Puritan Sabbatarianism. It states that the Pope is the Antichrist, which was a very common belief in seventeenth-century England. It also stated that the Roman Catholic mass is a form of idolatry, that the civil magistrates have divine authority to punish heresy, and rules out marriage with non-Christians. =Holy Scriptures, the Trinity and predestination= The confession begins with a definition of the Bible's content as well as an explication of its role within the church. Chapter 1 declares that the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, written Word of God. As the Word of God, the Bible is considered \\"the rule of faith and life.\\" The Holy Scriptures are said to possess infallible truth and divine authority, containing \\"all things necessary for [God's] own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life\\", so that no new revelations or human traditions can be added to it. The Confession of Faith states that, in the original languages, the Bible was kept pure and authentic. Because of this, the Scriptures alone are the church's final authority in all religious disputes. The confession states that \\"the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture\\" is \\"the supreme judge\\" of councils, ancient writers, doctrines, and private revelation. After describing the attributes of God, chapter 2 of the confession endorses the traditional doctrine of the Trinity, which holds that the one and only God exists as three persons, \\"of one substance, power, and eternity\\", namely, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Chapter 3 affirms the Reformed doctrine of predestination: that God foreordained who would be among the elect (and therefore saved), while he passed by those who would be damned for their sins. The confession states that from eternity God did \\"freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass\\". By God's decree, \\"some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life; and others foreordained to everlasting death.\\" Chapter 4 recounts the Genesis creation narrative and affirms that human beings were created in the image of God with immortal souls, having fellowship with God and dominion over other creatures. Chapter 6 recounts the Fall of Man whereby humans committed original sin and became subject to total depravity. According to the confession, the consequence of the fall and sin is that sinners are guilty before God, under divine wrath and the curse of the law, and, ultimately, subject to spiritual death. The confession states that the fall and all other sins were foreordained by divine providence; however, the confession also teaches that sin \\"proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God\\". God cannot be the author of sin because he is entirely holy and righteous. =Covenant theology, Christ's mediation and free will= Chapter 7 is a description of covenant theology, which holds that God has dealt with humans through various covenants. In the first covenant, a covenant of works, Adam and his descendants were promised life on the condition of perfect obedience. The fall made it impossible for man to keep this covenant, so God made another covenant, this one called the covenant of grace. In the covenant of grace, God freely offered sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ. As part of this covenant, God promises to give the elect the Holy Spirit to make them willing and able to believe. According to the confession, the covenant of grace was administered differently in the time of the law (during Old Testament times) and in the time of the gospel (during and after New Testament times). Under the law, the covenant was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances instituted among the Jewish people. These all anticipated Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, and were sufficient to give the elect of that time forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation. The confession teaches that under the gospel, the covenant of grace is dispensed more fully through the preaching of the Bible and the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper. Chapter 8 declares that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, was chosen by God the Father to be the mediator between God and man and hold the threefold office of prophet, priest, and king. It affirms his incarnation, virgin birth, and dual nature as both God and man. In his human nature, Christ was without sin. He was crucified and buried, and the confession teaches that he was bodily resurrected and afterward ascended into heaven where he intercedes on behalf of the living. It also teaches that Christ will return to earth to judge the world. Chapter 8 also describes Christ's sacrificial death as satisfying God's justice and attaining both humanity's reconciliation with God and everlasting life for the elect. Salvation is granted to individuals by means of the word of God and the Holy Spirit, who persuades them to believe and obey. Chapter 9 teaches that man's will is free, and that because of the fall, man lost the ability to do anything spiritually pleasing to God, and man's will became enslaved to his sinful nature. Man, after conversion, regains the ability to please God and to choose good, but sin remains within. Complete sinless perfection is only attainable after death in the state of glorification. =Salvation= Chapters 10 through 18 describe various phases or aspects of salvation. The confession teaches that‚Äîby the Holy Spirit and the preaching of the word‚ÄîGod effectually calls the elect out of the state of sin and death toward faith in Jesus Christ and spiritual life. It teaches that \\"elect infants\\" and \\"all other elect persons who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the Word\\" are regenerated and saved. Chapter 11 covers the doctrine of justification. It affirms the Reformation doctrines of justification by faith alone and the imputation of Christ's righteousness to the elect (the Catholic teaching of infused righteousness is specifically rejected). Justification can never be lost, but the justified are still able to sin and, as a result, confession and repentance must be ongoing. Chapter 12 states that all who are justified also partake in the grace of adoption and become children of God. In addition, those who are effectually called and regenerated are also sanctified. In sanctification, the dominion of sin is eliminated and lust is weakened and suppressed as the individual grows in holiness. Chapter 14 defines saving faith as that which enables people to believe to the saving of their souls. The confession states that it is the work of the Holy Spirit and is ordinarily accomplished by the preaching of the word. Saving faith is strengthened and increased by the preaching of the word, the sacraments, and prayer. This faith enables a person to believe that whatever is revealed in the Bible is true and to rest on Christ alone for eternal life. Chapter 15 stresses the need for repentance alongside saving faith. While repentance (rejecting sin and committing to obey God's commandments) does not earn forgiveness (which is the result of divine grace), the confession states that no sinner \\"may expect pardon without it.\\" The confession also describes the role of private and public confession of sin in the life of a Christian. Chapter 16 explains the role of good works (actions done in obedience to God's commandments) in the Christian life and their relationship to salvation. Good works are said to be the result of the Holy Spirit's influence and are evidence of true faith; however, good works cannot earn or merit salvation or forgiveness of sins. Chapter 17 presents the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, which holds that it is impossible for those effectually called to \\"fall away\\" from the state of grace or, in other words, lose their salvation. Chapter 18 states that believers can receive assurance of faith. This assurance is based on \\"the promises of salvation, the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are made, the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God\\". The confession does not teach that assurance is instantaneous upon conversion; rather, it states that \\"a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties, before he be partaker of it\\". =Law, Christian liberty and worship= Chapter 19 discusses God's law and Christian ethics. The confession states that while the ceremonial and juridical parts of biblical law have been abrogated under the New Covenant, the moral law as described in the Ten Commandments remains binding to all people. While true believers are neither \\"justified, or condemned\\" by the law, it serves \\"as a rule of life informing them of the will of God, and their duty\\". The confession also teaches that the Holy Spirit enables \\"the will of man to do that freely, and cheerfully, which the will of God, revealed in the law, requireth to be done.\\" Chapter 20 states that \\"God alone is Lord of the conscience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men.\\" The purpose of Christian liberty is to enable Christians to \\"serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him.\\" The confession warns that Christian liberty cannot be used to justify sinful behavior or to resist lawful secular and church authority. Chapter 21 describes the acceptable parameters of Reformed worship as governed by the regulative principle of worship. It also outlines a Puritan Sabbatarian position in regards to Christian behavior on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath. Chapter 22 describes the appropriate use of oaths and solemn vows, which are part of religious worship because the person calls upon God. =Civil government and marriage= Chapter 23 describes the role of the civil authorities in relation to the church. Governments are ordained by God to maintain justice and peace and to punish evil doers. The civil magistrate has no right to interfere with the preaching of the word of God or administration of the sacraments. The power of the keys is reserved exclusively to church authorities. Nevertheless, the civil magistrate has a duty to preserve church unity, suppress heresy, and prevent corruption and abuse within the church. To fulfill these obligations, the magistrate has authority to convene synods and ensure that its deliberations are agreeable to \\"the mind of God.\\" Chapter 23 also teaches that Christians are obligated to pray for civil authorities and to obey lawful commands. A magistrate's legal authority is not lost because of unbelief or religious differences. The confession denies that the Pope has any jurisdiction over civil magistrates or authority to deprive magistrates of their office if he determines them to be heretics. Chapter 24 covers Reformed teaching on marriage and divorce. Marriage is to be heterosexual and monogamous. The purpose of marriage is to provide for the mutual help of husband and wife, the birth of legitimate children, the growth of the church, and the prevention of \\"uncleanness.\\" The confession discourages interfaith marriage with non-Christians, Roman Catholics, or \\"other idolaters\\". In addition, godly persons should not be \\"unequally yoked\\" in marriage to \\"notoriously wicked\\" persons. Incestuous marriage, defined according to biblical guidelines, is also prohibited. The only grounds for divorce are adultery and willful abandonment by a spouse. =Church= Chapter 25 addresses Reformed ecclesiology or the teachings about the Christian Church. The confession teaches that the church is catholic (or universal) and both invisible and visible. The invisible church is made up of all the elect who will ever live. Christ is the head of the church, and the church is the body of Christ and the bride of Christ. The visible church includes all people alive throughout the world who \\"profess the true religion\\" and their children. It is described as the kingdom of Christ and the house and family of God. The confession teaches that there is no ordinary possibility of salvation outside of the visible church. It is said that Christ gave to the visible church \\"the ministry, oracles, and ordinances of God\\" for the perfecting of the saints. The confession teaches that local churches can be more or less pure depending on how faithfully they adhere to correct doctrine and worship. Yet, it acknowledges that even the purest churches might contain some theological error, while other churches have become so corrupted that they can no longer be called churches of Christ but instead are of Satan. The confession affirms that only Jesus Christ can be head of the church. It states that the pope is an Antichrist who \\"exalteth himself, in the Church, against Christ and all that is called God.\\" Chapter 26 presents Reformed teaching on the communion of saints. This is the spiritual union that Christians have with Christ and with one another that allows them to share in the grace, suffering, death, resurrection, and glory of Christ. =Sacraments= Chapter 27 summarizes Reformed sacramental theology. It states that sacraments were established by God as \\"signs and seals\\" of the covenant of grace to represent Christ and his benefits, to visibly differentiate members of the church from the rest of world and draw them to God's service. The confession teaches that in every sacrament there is a spiritual relation between the sign and what is being signified; because of this, the names and effects of one are attributed to the other. The effectiveness of a sacrament depends upon the work of the Holy Spirit and the words of institution, which contains a promise of benefit to worthy receivers. The confession teaches that only ordained ministers can provide the sacraments, of which there are only two: baptism and the Lord's Supper. Chapter 28 presents a summary of Reformed baptismal theology. Baptism joins a person to the visible church and signifies the person's union with Christ, regeneration, forgiveness of sin and newness of life. Individuals should be baptized in water using the Trinitarian formula (\\"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\\"). Baptism by immersion is not necessary; affusion and aspersion are acceptable modes. The confession approves of infant baptism if one or both parents are Christians. While it teaches that neglecting baptism is a \\"great sin\\", the confession does not endorse baptismal regeneration. It states that it is possible to be regenerated without baptism, and unregenerated with baptism. This is because the effectiveness of baptism is not tied to the moment in time it is administered; the grace promised is granted by the Holy Spirit to the elect according to God's own will and at the time of his choosing. According to the confession, baptism is to be received only once. Chapter 29 summarizes Presbyterian beliefs about the Lord's Supper. It states that the sacrament is to be observed in the church until the end of the world \\"for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of Himself in His death; the sealing all benefits thereof, unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in Him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto Him; and, to be a bond and pledge of their communion with Him, and with each other, as members of His mystical body.\\" The confession states that the Lord's Supper is not the actual sacrifice of Christ but rather a commemoration of Christ's one sacrifice for the remission of sins and an offering of praise to God. It explicitly condemns the Roman Catholic Church's teaching of \\"the popish sacrifice of the mass\\". It also rejects the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which states that after consecration by a priest the bread and wine miraculously become the body and blood of Christ. Rather, the confession teaches that communicants receive the body and blood of Christ and all the benefits of his death spiritually by faith, while the bread and wine remain physically unchanged. Ignorant, wicked and ungodly persons may eat the bread and wine, but they do not receive Christ. Instead, these unworthy persons are \\"guilty of the body and blood of the Lord\\" and commit great sin; for this reason, such persons should not be admitted to the sacrament. =Church government and discipline= Chapter 30 describes the role of church officers, who are appointed by Christ to govern the church. These officers hold the keys of the kingdom, giving them power to discipline church members through admonition, suspension from the Lord's Supper for a period of time, and excommunication, according to the severity of the offense. Church discipline is for the purpose of leading sinful church members to repentance, deterring others from similar behavior, vindicating the honor of Christ, and preventing the wrath of God from falling on the entire church. Chapter 31 states that synods and church councils have authority to settle religious controversies, make rules for the church and public worship, and judge cases of misconduct in the church. While synods may be called by civil authorities, they only have jurisdiction over ecclesiastical affairs and are not to intervene in civil affairs except \\"by way of humble petition in cases extraordinary; or, by way of advice\\". =Eschatology= Chapters 32 and 33 concern Christian eschatology. Chapter 32 describes what occurs after death‚Äîwhile the body decomposes, the immortal soul immediately returns to God. The souls of the righteous are then made perfect in holiness and received into heaven where they \\"behold the face of God\\" and wait for the redemption of their bodies. The souls of the wicked are sent to hell where they remain in torment until the judgment. The confession rejects the idea of purgatory because it is not present in scripture. The confession teaches that on the last day, those alive will not die but will be changed, and all the dead will be resurrected with the same bodies they had when alive. The bodies of the unjust will be \\"raised to dishonour\\", but the bodies of the just will be raised \\"unto honour\\" . Chapter 33 describes the Last Judgment in which the Father will give Christ authority to judge all apostate angels and every person that has lived on earth. Those judged will \\"give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds\\" and will \\"receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.\\" God's purpose in dispensing judgment is to show the glory of his mercy‚Äîby saving the elect‚Äîand of his justice‚Äîby the damnation of the reprobate. The righteous will receive eternal life in the presence of God, and the wicked will receive eternal torment and destruction. The date and time of the Last Judgment is unknown. Usage The Westminster Confession was adopted as a doctrinal standard by various Presbyterian churches around the world. These churches have at times repudiated or changed different parts of the confession over the years. =Australia= The Presbyterian Church of Australia holds to the Westminster Confession of Faith as its standard, subordinate to the Word of God, and read in the light of a declaratory statement. =England and Wales= *Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales - subordinate standard (excepting the authority of the \\"civil magistrate\\" over presbyteries in religious or moral matters and the identification of the Antichrist exclusively with the papacy which is deemed a matter of individual interpretation). Additionally, individual eiders and sessions may determine their own positions on the establishment principle as concerns the relationship between the church and state and the question of marriages to close relatives of deceased spouses. =Scotland= *Church of Scotland - subordinate standard but since 1986 has dissociated itself from four sections of the Confession (relating to monastic vows, marriage to Catholics and non-Christians, the identification of the Pope with the Antichrist and the Mass). Additionally, liberty of opinion is granted on those matters which do not enter into the substance of the faith.http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/650/westminster_confession.pdf *Free Church of Scotland - subordinate standard *United Free Church of Scotland - subordinate standard (but with liberty of judgement allowed on matters which do not enter into the substance of the faith)https://www.ufcos.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/General%20Assembly/2018/Ec%20Rel%20GA18.pdf =United States= With the Adopting Act of 1729, the Synod of Philadelphia officially adopted the Westminster Confession as the doctrinal standard for American Presbyterians. All ministerial candidates were required to subscribe to it but were allowed to declare scruples to those parts considered nonessential. This compromise left a permanent legacy to following generations of Presbyterians in America resulting in permanent controversies over the manner in which a minister is bound to accept the document; and it has left the American versions of the Westminster Confession more amenable to the will of the church to amend it. When the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was formed in 1789, it adopted the Westminster standards, as containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures. However, it revised chapters 20.4, 23.3, and 31.2 of the Confession, basically removing the civil magistrate (i.e., the state) from involvement in ecclesiastical matters. It also removed the phrase \\"tolerating a false religion\\" from the list of sins forbidden in Answer 109 of the Larger Catechism, and replaced \\"depopulations\\" in Answer 142 with \\"depredation.\\" The Confession was amended again in 1887, when the final sentence of chapter 24.4, which forbade the marrying of the close kindred of one's deceased spouse, was removed. The Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. adopted more sweeping revisions of its Confession in 1903. Chapter 16.7, on the works of unregenerate men, was rewritten. The last sentence of chapter 22.3, which forbade the refusing of a proper oath when imposed by lawful authority, was removed. Chapter 25.6, on the head of the church, was rewritten, and the identification of the Roman Catholic pope as the Antichrist was removed.

Kastellorizo is part of the Rhodes regional unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The island has become more popular in recent years among tourists looking for an isolated place in the Dodecanese, thanks also to the 1991 Oscar-winning movie Mediterraneo, by Gabriele Salvatores, which is set on the island during the Second World War. Name and etymology The island's official name, Megisti (ŒúŒµŒ≥ŒØœÉœÑŒ∑) means \\"biggest\\" or \\"greatest\\", but at only in area, it is the smallest of the Dodecanese. The name refers to the fact that it is the largest of the small archipelago.Bertarelli, 131 This name was used in antiquity,Strabo, Geographica 14.3.7 but is now rarely used in Greek, the name Kastell√≥rizo (ŒöŒ±œÉœÑŒµŒªŒªœåœÅŒπŒ∂Œø) being common since the 12th century. There are several hypotheses about the origin of this name. \\"Kastello\\" derives from the Italian word \\"castello\\", meaning \\"castle\\". There is some argument on the second part of the name. The arguments are centered on the following possible origins of the element rizo: #rizo being derived from the Italian word \\"rosso\\" meaning \\"red\\", either from the reddish color of the rocks of the island, the reddish color of the castle at sunset, or the color of the coat of arms of the Great Master of the Knights of Rhodes, Juan Fern√°ndez de Heredia, which stood above the gate of the castle; these arguments are widely discredited as the rocks on the island have no red pigment and the name Kastellorizo predates the Knights' arrival.Bertarelli, 131 #rizo being a corruption of the word \\"Rhoge\\", one of the ancient appellations of the nearby island of Ro. If this is correct, the island's modern name is actually an amalgam of the separate island names \\"Castello\\" and \\"Rhoge\\". #rizo being the actual Greek word \\"rizon\\" meaning \\"root\\", as researched by Greek Historian I.M. Hatzifotis (1996), to signify the foothill or 'rizovouno' on which the island's original castle was built. It has gone by several different names in its history, including Kastellorizo (Greek), Castellorizo (Greek name with Italian spelling), Castelrosso (Italian, meaning \\"Red Castle\\"), Ch√¢teau Rouge (French translation of Italian name) and or Kƒ±zƒ±lhisar, the former deriving from the island's official name in Greek, the latter meaning \\"Red Castle\\", a translation of the Italian name. Geography Map of Kastellorizo and the surrounding islets. Satellite picture of the island. The blue grotto Kastellorizo is (with the exception of the nearby islet of Strongyli) the easternmost Greek island and is situated in the Levantine Sea. It is the largest island of the homonym archipelago comprising the islands and islets of Agios Georgios, Agrielaia, Voutsakia, Megalo Mavro Poini, Mikro Mavro Poini, Polifados Ena, Polifados Dio, Ro, Savoura, Stroggili, Tragonera, Psomi and Psoradia. It lies about from the Anatolian coastal town of Ka≈ü, more or less halfway between Rhodes and Antalya. Cyprus is about to the south-east. It is six kilometres () long and three kilometres () wide, with a surface of . It has a triangular shape, and is oriented from NE to SW. The island features three capes: Agios Stefanos (north), Nifti (east) and Pounenti (south west); between the first two there is a wide and accommodating bay, the island's main harbor, where one finds the only town on the island. Cape Agios Stefanos, the nearest to Anatolia, is 2250m south of the modern Turkish town of Ka≈ü (Greek: And√≠fli, the Ancient Greek City of Antiph√©llos). Cape Nifti lies some greater distance from the Anatolian coast. The island is mountainous, with high and steep coastlines, which become more difficult to access moving west. The soil is composed of limestone and produces only small amounts of olives, grapes and beans. On the island there is no source of drinking water. The Municipality of Meg√≠sti includes the offshore islands of Ro and Strongyli as well as several smaller islets. It has a total land area of . =Climate= Kastellorizo has a hot- summer Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K√∂ppen climate classification). It has hot dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. A new meteorological station from the National Observatory of Athens was placed in Kastellorizo in summer 2018 while an older station from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service is operating on the island. =Geology= The island's geology is almost exclusively limestone laid down at the Mesozoic/Cenozoic boundary. As a result of the lack of significant flora covering the island, the landscape shows many features of karstification. There are a number of notable sea caves including the so-called Blue Grotto which is much larger than its namesake in Capri. Exploration undertaken in 2006 by members of the SELAS Caving club of Greece has revealed vertical caves in many parts of the island. The deepest found so far was surveyed to a depth of in March 2006 and will be the subject of further exploration in the future by the same team. Description of the island Kastellorizo town Panorama of the port. View of Mandraki, the small port. The houses of the town are slender and characterised by wooden balconies and windows of the Anatolian type.Bertarelli, 133 Behind the waterfront, many houses are still in a ruinous state. At the entrance to the harbour, on the east side, stand the single story remnants of the former Italian government house (palazzina della delegazione), erected in 1926 by the Italian architect Florestano Di Fausto, who also designed some of the most important buildings of the Italian period in Rhodes.Bertarelli, 132 Nearby is the island's former Ottoman mosque which dates from the second half of the 18th century and which has been restored and re-opened as a museum since 2007. From here starts the town's quay, which runs along all three sides of the harbour. The central square ‚ÄîPlateia Ethelondon Kastell√≥rizou (\\"Kastellorizo Volunteers' Square\\")‚Äîlies at the midpoint of the eastern side, near the vessel dock. On the opposite side of the harbour one has a good view from this vantage of Pera Meria, the western quay, and the monasteries of Profitis Il√≠as and Aghia Triadha, the former now an army base. Above the quay on the eastern side there is a pathway which leads to the Castle of the Knights (14th century). Of it remain the curtain wall, part of a square tower, the remains of a cylindrical tower at the east corner, and toward the sea another cylindrical tower.Bertarelli, 134 A Doric inscription, carved in the rock, attests to the existence of an earlier fortress here during Antiquity.Bertarelli, 134 Inside the tower there is a large covered cistern.Bertarelli, 134 Ascending the steps on the eastern side of the town, one reaches the suburb of Horafia, where there is a square surrounded by the Church of St. George (1906), with a high dome of Byzantine type, and the Cathedral of Saints Constantine and Helena (1835). It has three naves divided by monolithic granite columns from the temple of Apollo Lykios in Patara (Anatolia).Bertarelli, 133 The columns carry ogival arches. Further east is the small bay known as Mandraki, the secondary harbour of the island. West of the town, beyond the summit of the island known as Vigla (270 m), stands Palaiokastro (old castle), the island's ancient acropolis. This fortified elevation has classical origins (see below, history section): its plan is rectangular and measures .Bertarelli, 134 In its interior stand an ancient tower, built with square limestone blocks, and large water cisterns.Bertarelli, 134 Carved on the base of the castle there is also a Doric inscription, dating back to the 4th or 3rd centuries BC, with references to Megiste (the ancient name of Kastellorizo) and its dependence on Rhodes.Bertarelli, 134 On the east side there are remnants of a gateway, or propylaea.Bertarelli, 134 Since August 2020 the island also features an interactive Puzzle Museum, the first of its kind in Greece and one of the very few in the world. Transport The island is connected with Rhodes, Piraeus and Ka≈ü by ferry. Passenger ferries' frequency is as follows: *Kastellorizo - Rhodes - Symi - Tilos - Nisyros - Kalymnos - Piraeus : 2 trips / week (winter period) *Kastellorizo - Ka≈ü : 1 trip / week (winter period)http://ferries- turkey.com/ferry-routes/turkey-greece/kas-meis-ferry-en.html#start Air connection is provided by Olympic Air, which operates from Kastellorizo Airport 4 times/week (winter period).https://e-ticket.olympicair.com/pl/A3Online/wds/FlexPricerAvailability.action;jsessionid=QkUW9l5IS4t7GVZx1q7j4KDd5w-5AfHTKGO55jOHLSJTUeYa8Cwg!384344890!-982618842 There is one small bus in service on Kastellorizo and it is used to collect tourists from the airport. Nearby islands between Turkey and Kastellorizo There are many islets in this area; Volos, near Kalkan (in Greek Kalamaki), Ochendra, Furnachia, Prassonisi, Ro, Tragonera, Marathi, Strongyli, Dhassia, Alimentaria, Kekova and Psomi besides many rocks and cliffs.Bertarelli, 134 The most important among these islets is Kekova (also named Caravola), not inhabited, which has an area of and faces the Turkish village of Kalek√∂y (Simena in antiquity). All these islets were subject to dispute between Italy and Turkey until 1932. According to the 1932 Convention between Italy and Turkey all these islets except Ro, Strongyli and Psomi were assigned to Turkey. History =Ancient period= The island was colonised by Dorian Greeks, who named it \\"Megiste\\".Smith, William (1865), Dictionary of Greek and Roman geography, s.v. \\"Megiste\\". The Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax says that the island belonged to the Rhodians.Pseudo Scylax, Periplous, ¬ß100 In addition, inscriptions found at the foot of the Knight's castle confirm that during the Hellenistic period the island was ruled by Rhodes, and formed part of its Peraia. The Rhodians sent an overseer, or epistates, to monitor events on the island. Map of Kastellorizo by Piri Reis (1521) =Byzantine era= During the period of the Byzantine Empire, Kastellorizo was part of the \\"Province of the Islands\\", the capital of which was Rhodes. =Knights Hospitaller period= In 1306 the island was taken over by the Knights Hospitaller, headed by Foulques de Villaret, as part of their expedition to conquer the island of Rhodes, which became the centre of their Crusader State. They restored the castle, which was thereafter used as a prison for disobedient knights. Around 1440 the island was occupied by Sultan Djemal-el-din Yusuf of Egypt, who destroyed the castle. Ten years later it was conquered by Alfonso V of Aragon, king of Naples, who in 1461 rebuilt the castle and dispatched a Catalan governor. =Ottoman era= The Crown of Aragon retained possession of it until 1512, when it was conquered by Ottoman Sultan Suleiman I. On 22 September 1659, during the Siege of Candia, the island was conquered by Venice and the castle was destroyed again, but the Ottomans were able to regain it again soon after. Between 1828 and 1833 Kastell√≥rizo joined the Greek insurgents, but after the end of the Greek War of Independence it came back into the possession of the Ottoman Empire. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Kastellorizo (Meyis) had a total population of 4.871, consisting of 4.635 Greeks, 225 Muslims, 6 Jews and 5 foreign citizens.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 130-131 In 1912, during the Libyan war between Italy and the Ottoman Empire, the inhabitants asked Giovanni Battista Ameglio, chief of the Italian occupation forces in Rhodes, for their island to be annexed to Italy. This was refused, and on 14 March 1913 the local population imprisoned the governor and his Ottoman garrison and proclaimed a provisional government.Bertarelli, 132 In August 1913, the Greek government sent from Samos a provisional governor supported by gendarmes, but in early 1914 in Florence it was decided the return of the island to the Ottoman Empire. =WWI and Italian period= On 28 December 1915, during WWI, while the Kingdom of Greece was still neutral, the French navy led by the cruiser Jeanne d'Arc occupied the island at the behest of the inhabitants who feared Turkish reprisals. The French quickly blocked another landing attempted on the same day by a royalist Greek contingent of Evzones. Turkish shore batteries responded to the French occupation by shelling the island in 1917, succeeding in sinking the British seaplane carrier HMS Ben-my-Chree. In the Treaty of S√®vres the island was assigned to Italy and the Italian navy assumed it from the French on 1 March 1921, but the treaty was never ratified. The Treaty of Lausanne confirmed the Italian claim on Kastellorizo, and the island ‚Äì under the Italian name \\"Castelrosso\\" ‚Äì was then integrated in the possession of the Isole Italiane dell'Egeo. Because of the Italian occupation, the island was not affected directly by the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey of 1923, but the forced emigration of the large Greek population living on the nearby Anatolian coast hit heavily the economy of the island. The 1932 Convention between Italy and Turkey, which defined the sea border between the two powers, assigned all the islets of the small archipelago around Kastellorizo except Ro and Strongyli to Turkey. During the 1930s it was a stopover for French and British seaplanes. During the Second World War, on 25 February 1941, in the course of Operation Abstention, British Commandos occupied the island, but Italian forces from Rhodes recaptured it some days later. After the British occupation, fearing a German invasion, some of the inhabitants fled to Gaza in Palestine. When Italy capitulated to the Allies (8 September 1943), the island was occupied again by Allied forces, and it remained under their occupation for the rest of the war. In July 1944, a fuel dump caught fire, which spread to an adjacent ammunition dump, thereby destroying half of the homes on the island. =Modern Greek era= Kastellorizo was assigned to Greece with the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. In May 1945 it was still under British administration, but on September 15, 1947 effectively came under Greek administration. The island formally joined the Greek State on 7 March 1948 together with the other Dodecanese islands. The island has become more popular in recent years, among tourists looking for an isolated place in the Dodecanese, thanks also to the 1991 Oscar-winning movie Mediterraneo, by Gabriele Salvatores, which is set on the island. Kastell√≥rizo was the only territory of the European Union where the solar eclipse of March 29, 2006 was visible in its totality. In 2011, the French ship Dignit√©-Al Karama, the only member the Freedom Flotilla II that managed to approach Gaza, refueled at Kastellorizo. The ship was warmly received by the inhabitants, some of whom remembered about the shelter the island's inhabitants had found in Gaza, then under British control, during World War II. Demographics and economy CS Salamis Glory in Kastellorizo harbour. The population and the economy reached its apogee at the end of the 19th century with an estimated 10,000 people residing there. At that time, Kastellorizo was still the only safe harbor along the route between Makri (today's Fethiye) and Beirut.Bertarelli, 132 Its sailing ships traded products from Anatolia (coal, timber, valonia, pine bark) for Egyptian goods (rice, sugar, coffee, tissues and yarns), and carried Anatolian cereals to Rhodes and Cyprus.Bertarelli, 132 On the island there was also a flourishing production of charcoal (much sought after in Alexandria, where it was used for narghile).Bertarelli, 132 The fishing industry‚Äîmainly sea sponges‚Äîwas important too.Bertarelli, 132 At the dawn of the 20th century the decay of the island's economy set in, accelerated by the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. In the late 1920s the island's population dropped to 3,000, while about 8,000 inhabitants lived abroad, predominantly in Australia, Egypt, Greece and the U.S.Bertarelli, 132 At that time the town had 730 inhabited houses, while 675 were already empty, and many ruined.Bertarelli, 132 The population, according to the 2011 census, now stands at 492, all living in the town of Meg√≠sti. The municipality also includes the islands of Ro and Strongyli, both without permanent inhabitants. Many of its emigrants live in Australia (especially Perth and Sydney), where they are known as \\"Kazzies\\". During the Ottoman period a tiny Turkish minority existed on the island, while a large Greek population resided on the adjoining coast until the imposed population exchange of 1923. The Turkish minority had a graveyard that still exists near the castle. They also built a mosque on the island. There are many Turkish families from Kastellorizo in Turkey's Antalya Province. Kastellorizo also had a few Jewish merchant families living there during the Ottoman period. Culture Kastellorizo's inhabitants had characteristic traditions, partly influenced by the Muslim tradition. There were at least three types of women's dress, which used brilliantly colored fabric, and women wore necklaces, brooches, pendants and earrings made from ancient Venetian or Byzantine gold coins.Bertarelli, 132 The women's festive dress consisted of: *One or more long silk blouses (ipok√°miso). The most external one was closed on the front by six large filigreed gold or silver buttons. These buttons were shaped as a half-sphere depressed in the middle. From the lowest one was hung a small chain with a cross;Bertarelli, 132 *A pair of short pants (katof√≥ri) whose lower part was made with good quality material quilted with gold thread;Bertarelli, 132 *A sleeved jacket (zepuni) made with brilliant colored silk or velvet, opened at the front;Bertarelli, 132 *Another long underskirt (kavadi), laced with gold thread, also opened at the front; *A large scarf (zosma) made with three or four silk strips, quilted with gold or silver thread. It was tied very low on the sides, like a loose belt;Bertarelli, 132 *A large velvet coat (gunna) decorated with gold and silver lace on the hems and on the back, with *fur lapels: It was always kept open;Bertarelli, 132 *A woolen cap;Bertarelli, 132 *A quadrangular wrinkled silken shawl (mandili), decorated with relief flowers and fringed hems, coloured in white, red and deep blue. Folded diagonally, it was fixed above the cap, with its longest angle falling on the back almost to the ground, while the side edges were folded on the front or put over the shoulders;Bertarelli, 132 *The socks were woven with multicolored wool or silk;Bertarelli, 132 *The shoes were shaped like tipped slippers, and were made of velvet or silk. They were laced with gold or silver thread and shorter than the foot;Bertarelli, 132 The other types of dress were similar, but not so lavish and without fur decorations.Bertarelli, 132 The girls' dress was simpler. Single and engaged girls, and married women and widows were also distinguished by dress.Bertarelli, 132 =Religion, customs and superstitions= The engagement, which was decided by the parents, and the wedding, which lasted 15 days, occurred through prescribed and curious ceremonies, having symbolic and poetic meaning.Bertarelli, 133 Weddings were celebrated on Sunday, in the church of Agios Konstantinos, and an announcement on the main square invited the whole city to participate. Also baptisms and funerals (with mourning women, or praeficae, and a dish with oil and wine crushed on the coffin) had well-established rituals.Bertarelli, 133 On December 31 and on New Year's Day, groups of children carrying small cardboard boats adorned with ribbons and small flags go around visiting houses, stores and coffee shops, singing songs with good wishes and receiving coins and wheat cakes, while the elderly exchange visits.Bertarelli, 133 On the morning of Agios Basilios day, coming back from Liturgy, the men customarily throw a pomegranate hard against the walls of their homes, wishing for abundance and happiness for their family. The more seeds that are spread around the rooms, the more luck the family will have in the coming year.Bertarelli, 133 The day before the feast of Agios Elias on July 19 (the feast itself is on July 20) first the children and then the men jump into the sea, and wear their wet clothes the whole day. Those who do not want to participate are sometimes forced to do so.Bertarelli, 133M. Hamilton, \\"The Pagan Element in the Names of Saints\\", The Annual of the British School at Athens 13 (1906-07) 348-55, pp. 353-54. On Easter, the Liturgy of the Resurrection takes place in the open at midnight, the faithful bearing candles. As soon as the bells start ringing, the young people let off fireworks, and the people tell each other the ritual words \\"Christ is resurrected\\". Then everyone enters the church and lights his candle from the holy fire held by the priest, and then goes home to light the fire in the fireplace.Bertarelli, 133 On Easter Monday the whole population gathers in the main square, and they remain there the whole day eating, drinking and singing. In the past single girls had to stay at home, but they were allowed to stay in the entrance, where they sang and played with swings.Bertarelli, 133 On May 1, at dawn, all the girls of the island, in groups, each one carrying a jar, went to get water outside of town, but they were not allowed to speak a single word during the route. This water (Amilito Ner√≥, \\"water of silence\\") was supposed to bring good luck to the family. Everyone washed him/herself with it that day, and every utensil and wall of the house was splashed with it. When a girl became engaged, she filled a crystal carafe with it and brought it to her future mother-in-law, who gave her in return a special cake and an odd number of gold coins.Bertarelli, 133 When a child became seriously ill, a woman with knowledge of prayers against the evil eye was invited to her/his home. She drew signs of the cross on the body of the child with a thurible filled with embers and branches of the olive tree which had been gathered in the church on Palm Sunday, pronouncing the following words: \\"Christ came: then he laid down his stick and chased away the snake and the bad neighbor from our home\\". After this exorcism, the woman would throw the content of the thurible into a bucket filled with water, and then count the pieces of wood which did not burn. This number was said to be equal to the number of persons who were supposed to have enchanted the sick child. The enchantment of the child was sure, if the olive leaves burned with a loud crackling sound.Bertarelli, 133 When a man was going to emigrate, gentle, sorrowful songs were sung to him by his friends.Bertarelli, 133 Notable people *Georgios Mavros, politician *Lady of Ro, patriot Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities Kastellorizo is twinned with: * Perth, Western Australia, Australia * Antalya, Turkey Cinema and popular culture Mediterraneo (1991) was filmed on the island. Kastellorizo also lends its name to David Gilmour's instrumental track \\"Castellorizon\\" from his album On an Island (2006). He stayed on the island in the early 1990s with his wife, Polly Samson, and many close friends. The music reflects the memories of the time spent there, and is a tribute to the friends who have since died.

He is believed to have been responsible for enabling the (presumed) murders of the Princes in the Tower, though there is no conclusive evidence to prove it. He died defending the King at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Early life His date of birth is unknown.http://www.shakespeareandhistory.com/robert-brakenbury.php He was a younger son of Thomas Brackenbury of Denton, County Durham, England. This was a family which had been known in Durham since the end of the 12th century. They were lords of the manors of Burne Hall, Denton and Saleby. Robert inherited Saleby; in the immediate vicinity of Barnard Castle. Barnard Castle had passed to the Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) in the right of his wife, Anne Neville in about 1474. Richard III and Brackenbury, were therefore, close neighbours. Indeed, a tower of Barnard Castle is still called Brackenbury Tower. Royal service Brackenbury was one of Richard III's close associates. He was treasurer of Richard's household when he was Duke of Gloucester. When King Edward died Brackenbury was almost certainly one of the Northerners who accompanied Richard to London. Shortly after Richard took the throne Brackenbury received a number of appointments, including Constable of the Tower of London. After the collapse of the Buckingham Revolt he was rewarded with large grants of land in the south-east of England forfeited by Rivers and the Cheney family and in 1484 was appointed sheriff of Kent. Brackenbury remained Constable of the Tower and on 17 July 1483 he was appointed Constable of the Tower for life. He was also given the very lucrative post of Master of the King's Moneys and Keeper of the Exchange, that is, Master of the Mint after the execution of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, the previous incumbent. Many other honours and duties were laid on him. In March 1485 he was entrusted with Richard's bastard son, John of Gloucester, whom he took to Calais to become its Captain. In May he was placed in command of the defence of London. His income must have exceeded ¬£500 per year ‚Äì more than many Barons. He must have been better rewarded than all but three or four of the household. Between August 1484 and January 1485 he was knighted. Brackenbury seems to have been a man of popularity and wide learning. The Italian poet Pietro Cameliano, dedicated one of his Latin works to him. Brackenbury and the Princes in the Tower As Constable of the Tower of London, Brackenbury inevitably figures in any account of the fate of Richard III's nephews, the Princes in the Tower. For example, in Thomas More‚Äôs version of the life of Richard III, More says that after the coronation on 6 July 1483 and while on his way to Gloucester, Richard sent John Green to Brackenbury with written orders for Brackenbury to kill the princes. Brackenbury, says More, replied \\"that he would never put them to death, though he should die therefore\\". So Richard then ordered Sir James Tyrrell to go to Brackenbury with a letter by which he was commanded to deliver to Sir James all the keys of the Tower for one night, \\"to the end he might there accomplish the King's pleasure\\". Although Thomas More seems to have written a rather convincing account of the events during the reign of Richard III, it should not be relied on wholeheartedly. Thomas More was only 7 years old during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Tudor invasion and death In 1485, when news arrived that Henry Tudor had landed in Wales he was ordered to escort Lords Hungerford and Bourchier to Leicester but en route they escaped. When Richard III marched against the invader, Brackenbury hurried himself to reach the King and arrived two days before the Battle of Bosworth Field (22 August 1485), in which ‚Äì according to Molinet and Lindsay ‚Äì he had joint command of Richard's vanguard; he took part in the final charge on Henry and was killed by Sir Walter Hungerford of Farleigh fighting beside Richard III. On 7 November 1485, Brackenbury was posthumously attainted by Henry VII. In a document antedating Henry Tudor's rule, Brackenbury was charged with having \\"assembled to them at Leicester ... a great host, traitorously intending, imagining and conspiring the destruction of the king's royal person, our sovereign liege lord\\". Brackenbury's attainder was partly reversed in 1489 in favour of his sisters and bastard son, allowing them to recover the family lands but not the new grants from Richard III. Ralph, his nephew and heir male inherited Saleby. Sources *Bennett, Michael, The Battle of Bosworth.

Ratcliffe came from a gentry family in the Lake District, and became a companion of Richard when the latter was still Duke of Gloucester (1461‚Äì83). He was one of Richard's trustees in the lordship of Richmond, and was named steward of Barnard Castle. Richard, while Duke of Gloucester, knighted Ratcliffe during the Scottish campaigns, at the same time creating him a knight banneret.Ross, Charles. Richard III. 1981 During the seizure of power by Richard III, Ratcliffe was chosen to return to the north and organize an army to help the Protector, as Richard III was then titled. Some sources name Ratcliffe as the person who gave the order to execute Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers (beheaded Jun 1483). When Richard became king he gave Ratcliffe a number of offices, including the currently attainted hereditary High Sheriff of Westmorland, and made him a Knight of the Garter. He also received a large grant of lands, including much that had belonged to the Courtenay Earls of Devon. After the rebellion of 1483 he was given a very large number of forfeited estates. As a result, he had an income larger than most barons. In July 1484, William Collingbourne, a Tudor agent, tacked up a lampooning poem to St. Paul's Cathedral, which mentions Ratcliffe among the three aides to King Richard, whose emblem was a white boar: Ratcliffe had married Agnes Scrope, daughter of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton, one of the great barons in the north of England.

McLoughlin, Jr., Billy Sunday Was His Real Name (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955), xvii: \\"By 1917 he was considered by many the greatest revivalist in American history, perhaps the greatest since the days of the apostles.\\" Born into poverty in Iowa, Sunday spent some years at the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home before working at odd jobs and playing for local running and baseball teams. His speed and agility provided him the opportunity to play baseball in the major leagues for eight years, where he was an average hitter and a good fielder known for his base-running. Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left baseball for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his skills as a pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist before the advent of electronic sound systems. He also made a great deal of money and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919. Despite questions about his income, no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was sincerely devoted to his wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him. His audiences grew smaller during the 1920s as Sunday grew older, religious revivals became less popular, and alternative sources of entertainment appeared. Nevertheless, Sunday continued to preach and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death. Early life Billy Sunday was born near Ames, Iowa. His father, William Sunday, was the son of German immigrants named Sonntag, who had anglicized their name to \\"Sunday\\" when they settled in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. William Sunday was a bricklayer who worked his way to Iowa, where he married Mary Jane Corey, daughter of \\"Squire\\" Martin Corey, a local farmer, miller, blacksmith, and wheelwright.McLoughlin, 1‚Äì2. Martin, 2. William Sunday enlisted in the Iowa Twenty-Third Volunteer Infantry on August 14, 1862. He died four months later of pneumonia at an army camp in Patterson, Missouri, five weeks after the birth of his youngest son, William Ashley. Mary Jane Sunday and her children moved in with her parents for a few years, and young Billy became close to his grandparents and especially his grandmother. Mary Jane Sunday later remarried, but her second husband soon deserted the family.McLoughlin, 1‚Äì3. Martin, 4‚Äì5. When Billy Sunday was ten years old, his impoverished mother sent him and an older brother to the Soldiers' Orphans Home in Glenwood, Iowa, and later to the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home in Davenport, Iowa. At the orphanage, Sunday gained orderly habits, a decent primary education, and the realization that he was a good athlete.Dorsett, 8‚Äì10, 13. By fourteen, Sunday was shifting for himself. In Nevada, Iowa, he worked for Colonel John Scott, a former lieutenant governor, tending Shetland ponies and doing other farm chores. The Scotts provided Sunday a good home and the opportunity to attend Nevada High School.The 4-H baseball field in Nevada is named Billy Sunday Field. Although Sunday never received a high school diploma, by 1880 he was better educated than many of his contemporaries.\\"He had almost completed a high school education, which many young Americans of his generation lacked.\\" Martin, 8. According to Lyle Dorsett, Sunday was \\"much better educated than the typical American.\\" Dorsett, 14. In 1880, Sunday relocated to Marshalltown, Iowa, where, because of his athleticism, he had been recruited for a fire brigade team. In Marshalltown, Sunday worked at odd jobs, competed in fire brigade tournaments, and played for the town baseball team. In 1882, with Sunday in left field, the Marshalltown team defeated the state champion Des Moines team 13‚Äì4.Dorsett, 15; Knickerbocker, 26‚Äì7. Professional baseball player Sunday's professional baseball career was launched by Adrian \\"Cap\\" Anson, a Marshalltown native and future Hall of Famer, after his aunt, an avid fan of the Marshalltown team, gave him an enthusiastic account of Sunday's prowess. In 1883, on Anson's recommendation, A.G. Spalding, president of the Chicago White Stockings, signed Sunday to the defending National League champions.Anson's aunt, Emily Haviland attended Marshalltown games with her husband Marshall, who was the official team scorer in 1871. In 1916, Anson recalled that his aunt \\"finally induced me to give Billy a chance in Chicago. She was what you call a dyed-in-the-wool fan and never missed a game the Marshalltown club ever played.\\" In 1921, Sunday told veteran writer William Phelon Jr., \\"It was owing to the fact that Capt. Anson of the Chicago team had an aunt in Marshalltown that I became a big leaguer.\\" Cap \\"had Aunt Emma there and she was greatly interested in seeing me progress in baseball. She praised my playing to Anson, told him I was about the fastest fielder on earth and insisted that he give me a chance with Chicago and he agreed.\\" Rosenberg, 132. Sunday struck out four times in his first game, and there were seven more strikeouts and three more games before he got a hit. During his first four seasons with Chicago, he was a part-time player, taking Mike \\"King\\" Kelly's place in right field when Kelly served as catcher.Cap Anson, Sunday's captain- manager, said in his 1900 autobiography that Sunday struck out his first thirteen times at bat. However, contemporary newspaper accounts report eleven strikeouts at most, with two of his other at-bats reported simply as outs, probably not made by striking out. Sunday's verifiable strikeouts-in-a-row are four. Knickerbocker, 31‚Äì32. Sunday's speed was his greatest asset, and he displayed it both on the basepaths and in the outfield. In 1885, the White Stockings arranged a race between Sunday and Arlie Latham, the fastest runner in the American Association. Sunday won the hundred-yard dash by about ten feet.Knickerbocker, 45‚Äì47; Firstenberger, 18. Sunday had been uncomfortable with this race and tried to withdraw. Anson persuaded Sunday to run because a great deal of money had been bet on the outcome, some of it put up by Sunday's teammates. In later years he regretted having been involved in a gambling event. The win was noted by contemporary newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune (November 9, 1885, quoted in Knickerbocker, 47), as \\"by three yards\\", or about ten feet. Sunday's personality, demeanor, and athleticism made him popular with the fans, as well as with his teammates. Manager Cap Anson considered Sunday reliable enough to make him the team's business manager, which included such duties as handling the ticket receipts and paying the team's travel expenses.Sunday later said, \\"That was my first experience at bookkeeping and I was never shy a dollar.\\" Bruns, 39‚Äì40; Knickerbocker, 37. In 1887, when Kelly was sold to another team, Sunday became Chicago's regular right fielder, but an injury limited his playing time to fifty games. During the following winter Sunday was sold to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys for the 1888 season. He was their starting center fielder, playing a full season for the first time in his career. The crowds in Pittsburgh took to Sunday immediately; one reporter wrote that \\"the whole town is wild over Sunday.\\" Although Pittsburgh had a losing team during the 1888 and 1889 seasons, Sunday performed well in center field and was among the league leaders in stolen bases.Knickerbocker, 73‚Äì75, 97, 109, 120; Bruns, 51; Dorsett, 36‚Äì39.Billy Sunday, Center Fielder, Chicago White Stockings, c. 1887 In 1890, a labor dispute led to the formation of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday's conscience would not allow him to break his contract with Pittsburgh. Sunday was named team captain, and he was their star player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons in baseball history. By August the team had no money to meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.Knickerbocker, 125‚Äì131. The Philadelphia team had an opportunity to win the National League pennant, and the owners hoped that adding Sunday to the roster would improve their chances. Although Sunday played well in his thirty-one games with Philadelphia, the team finished in third place.Knickerbocker,131‚Äì133; Bruns, 51; Dorsett, 36‚Äì39. In March 1891, Sunday requested and was granted a release from his contract with the Philadelphia ball club. Over his career, Sunday was never much of a hitter: his batting average was .248 over 499 games, about the median for the 1880s. In his best season, in 1887, Sunday hit .291, ranking 17th in the league. He was an exciting but inconsistent fielder. In the days before outfielders wore gloves, Sunday was noted for thrilling catches featuring long sprints and athletic dives, but he also committed a great many errors. Sunday was best known as an exciting base-runner, regarded by his peers as one of the fastest in the game, even though he never placed better than third in the National League in stolen bases.Fans reportedly said, \\"Billy is fast enough, but he can't steal first base.\\" Knickerbocker, 135‚Äì137, 2‚Äì3. Sunday remained a prominent baseball fan throughout his life. He gave interviews and opinions about baseball to the popular press;For example, in 1917 Baseball Magazine published his opinions on baseball's patriotic value and the game's importance to the nation in wartime. he frequently umpired minor league and amateur games in the cities where he held revivals; and he attended baseball games whenever he could, including a 1935 World Series game two months before he died.Sunday obituary in Sporting News, November 14, 1935, 2, quoted in Knickerbocker, 156. Sunday \\"attended one game of the 1935 World series, but declared himself so disgusted with the umpiring that he stayed away from the remaining contests.\\" Conversion On a Sunday afternoon in Chicago, during either the 1886 or 1887 baseball season, Sunday and several of his teammates were out on the town on their day off. At one street corner, they stopped to listen to a gospel preaching team from the Pacific Garden Mission. Attracted by the hymns he had heard his mother sing, Sunday began attending services at the mission. After talking with a former society matron who worked there, Sundayafter some struggle on his partdecided to become a Christian. He began attending the fashionable Jefferson Park Presbyterian Church, a congregation handy to both the ball park and his rented room.Knickerbocker, 80‚Äì89; Dorsett, 24‚Äì28. Sunday could never remember the date of this experience, although he made repeated reference to it. The oft- told conversion story poses a number of chronological difficulties. The best explication of the problems and their partial solutions is Knickerbocker, 59‚Äì63, 79‚Äì89. Although he socialized with his teammates and sometimes gambled, Sunday was never a heavy drinker. In his autobiography, he said, \\"I never drank much. I was never drunk but four times in my life. ... I used to go to the saloons with the baseball players, and while they would drink highballs and gin fizzes and beer, I would take lemonade.\\"Billy Sunday, The Sawdust Trail, 67. Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.Dorsett, 29; Knickerbocker, 61‚Äì62. Marriage In 1886, Sunday was introduced at Jefferson Park Presbyterian Church to Helen Amelia \\"Nell\\" Thompson, daughter of the owner of one of Chicago's largest dairy products businesses. Although Sunday was immediately smitten with her, both had serious on-going relationships that bordered on engagements.Firstenberger, 7. Furthermore, Nell Thompson had grown to maturity in a much more privileged environment than had Sunday, and her father strongly discouraged the courtship, viewing all professional baseball players as \\"transient ne'er-do- wells who were unstable and destined to be misfits once they were too old to play.\\"Dorsett, 34. Nevertheless, Sunday pursued and eventually married her. On several occasions, Sunday said, \\"She was a Presbyterian, so I am a Presbyterian. Had she been a Catholic, I would have been a Catholicbecause I was hot on the trail of Nell.\\" Mrs. Thompson had liked Sunday from the start and weighed in on his side, and Mr. Thompson finally relented. The couple was married on September 5, 1888.Dorsett, 32‚Äì34; Frankenberg, 62; Martin, 34. Apprenticeship for evangelism In the spring of 1891, Sunday turned down a baseball contract for $3,500 a year to accept a position with the Chicago YMCA at $83 per month. Sunday's job title at the YMCA was Assistant Secretary, yet the position involved a great deal of ministerial work. It proved to be good preparation for his later evangelistic career. For three years Sunday visited the sick, prayed with the troubled, counseled the suicidal, and visited saloons to invite patrons to evangelistic meetings.Dorsett, 39‚Äì43, 48. Sunday's father-in-law was unhappy that Sunday had exchanged the promise of $3,000 for seven months of work for a six-day-a-week job that paid $1,000 per year. In 1893, Sunday became the full-time assistant to J. Wilbur Chapman, one of the best known evangelists in the United States at the time. Chapman was well educated and was a meticulous dresser, \\"suave and urbane.\\"Dorsett, 51. Personally shy, like Sunday, Chapman commanded respect in the pulpit both because of his strong voice and his sophisticated demeanor. Sunday's job as Chapman's advance man was to precede the evangelist to cities in which he was scheduled to preach, organize prayer meetings and choirs, and in general take care of necessary details. When tents were used, Sunday would often help erect them.Dorsett, 49‚Äì57. By listening to Chapman preach night after night, Sunday received a valuable course in homiletics. Chapman also critiqued Sunday's own attempts at evangelistic preaching and showed him how to put a good sermon together. Further, Chapman encouraged Sunday's theological development, especially by emphasizing the importance of prayer and by helping to \\"reinforce Billy's commitment to conservative biblical Christianity.\\"Dorsett, 53‚Äì54, 57. Popular evangelist Sunday preaches =Kerosene circuit= When Chapman unexpectedly returned to the pastorate in 1896, Sunday struck out on his own, beginning with meetings in tiny Garner, Iowa. For the next twelve years Sunday preached in approximately seventy communities, most of them in Iowa and Illinois. Sunday referred to these towns as the \\"kerosene circuit\\" because, unlike Chicago, most were not yet electrified. Towns often booked Sunday meetings informally, sometimes by sending a delegation to hear him preach and then telegraphing him while he was holding services somewhere else.Dorsett, 58‚Äì59, 62‚Äì63. Sunday also took advantage of his reputation as a baseball player to generate advertising for his meetings. In 1907 in Fairfield, Iowa, Sunday organized local businesses into two baseball teams and scheduled a game between them. Sunday came dressed in his professional uniform and played on both sides. Although baseball was his primary means of publicity, Sunday also once hired a circus giant to serve as an usher.Knickerbocker, 145‚Äì146; McLaughlin, 11. One newspaper reporting on the Garner revival \\"to be conducted by W.A. Sunday\\" noted that \\"this must be 'Billy' Sunday who used to play ball for Anson with the Chicago White Stockings. 'Billy' is as true a Christian gentleman as he was a rattling ball player, and that is saying a good deal.\\" When Sunday began to attract crowds larger than could be accommodated in rural churches or town halls, he pitched rented canvas tents. Again, Sunday did much of the physical work of putting them up, manipulating ropes during storms, and seeing to their security by sleeping in them at night. Not until 1905 was he well-off enough to hire his own advance man.Dorsett, 61‚Äì64. In 1906, an October snowstorm in Salida, Colorado, destroyed Sunday's tenta special disaster because revivalists were typically paid with a freewill offering at the end of their meetings. Thereafter he insisted that towns build him temporary wooden tabernacles at their expense. The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold at the end of the meetings), and locals had to put up the money for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising tabernacles provided good public relations for the coming meetings as townspeople joined together in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the tabernacles were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.Dorsett, 64‚Äì65; Firstenberger, 46. =Under the administration of Nell= Eleven years into Sunday's evangelistic career, both he and his wife had been pushed to their emotional limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity.Dorsett, 81‚Äì83. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.Dorsett, 81‚Äì84; Firstenberger, 45, 98‚Äì100. In 1911, Nell Sunday met Nora Lynn at the Erie, Pennsylvania campaign and persuaded her to become the Sundays' live-in housekeeper. Lynn was employed by the Sundays for twenty years; she effectively became a member of the Sunday family and died in their house. Nell Sunday transformed her husband's out-of-the-back-pocket organization into a \\"nationally renowned phenomenon.\\"Dorsett, 86. New personnel were hired, and by the New York campaign of 1917, the Sundays had a paid staff of twenty-six. There were musicians, custodians, and advance men; but the Sundays also hired Bible teachers of both sexes, who among other responsibilities, held daytime meetings at schools and shops and encouraged their audiences to attend the main tabernacle services in the evenings. The most significant of these new staff members were Homer Rodeheaver, an exceptional song leader and music director who worked with the Sundays for almost twenty years, and Virginia Healey Asher, who (besides regularly singing duets with Rodeheaver) directed the women's ministries, especially the evangelization of young working women.Dorsett, 86, 100‚Äì104; Firstenberger, 124‚Äì126. Firstenberger has documented more than seventy individuals who were members of the Sunday evangelistic team through the years of Billy Sunday's ministry. Virginia Asher and her husband William had known the Sundays since the 1890s and had previously worked for Dwight L. Moody and other evangelists. Asher organized permanent, post-campaign \\"Virginia Asher Councils\\" to continue work among those who, during that period, were called \\"businesswomen.\\" Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist A. B. MacDonald was also an assistant in 1917. =Campaign platform= Billy Sunday preaching on March 15, 1915 in a temporary tabernacle erected on the site of the Central Library of the Free Library of Philadelphia.

Free Library of Philadelphia - Digital Collections. Accessed 5 March 2020. With his wife administering the campaign organization, Sunday was free to do what he did best: compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran from one end of the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era. A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote: Homer Rodeheaver said that \\"One of these sermons, until he tempered it down a little, had one ten-minute period in it where from two to twelve men fainted and had to be carried out every time I heard him preach it.\\", p. 87 Some religious and social leaders criticized Sunday's exaggerated gestures as well as the slang and colloquialisms that filled his sermons, but audiences clearly enjoyed them.Firstenberger, 36‚Äì39. Fundamentalist leader Bob Jones, Jr., who knew Sunday as a teenager, admitted in his memoirs that he was \\"repelled by the roughness\\" of Sunday's performance and noted that Sunday's messages seemed \\"studied and stage-managed\\" ‚Äî which of course, they were. Bob Jones [Jr.], Cornbread and Caviar: Reminiscences and Reflections (Greenville, South Carolina: Bob Jones University Press, 1985), 89. In 1907, journalist Lindsay Denison complained that Sunday preached \\"the old, old doctrine of damnation\\". Denison wrote, \\"In spite of his conviction that the truly religious man should take his religion joyfully, he gets his results by inspiring fear and gloom in the hearts of sinners. The fear of death, with torment beyond it‚Äîintensified by examples of the frightful deathbeds of those who have carelessly or obdurately put off salvation until it is too late‚Äîit is with this mighty menace that he drives sinners into the fold.\\"Denison, Lindsay (1907), \\"The Rev. Billy Sunday and His War On the Devil\\", The American Magazine, September, 1907, 64(5), p. 461 But Sunday himself told reporters \\"with ill-concealed annoyance\\" that his revivals had \\"no emotionalism.\\"McLoughlin, 128. Certainly contemporary comparisons to the extravagances of mid-nineteenth-century camp meetings‚Äîas in the famous drawing by George Bellows‚Äîwere overdrawn.McLoughlin, 127. Sunday told one reporter that he believed that people could \\"be converted without any fuss,\\"Rocky Mountain News, September 7, 1914, 1, in McLoughlin, 128. and, at Sunday's meetings, \\"instances of spasm, shakes, or fainting fits caused by hysteria were few and far between.\\"McLoughlin, 128. Crowd noise, especially coughing and crying babies, was a significant impediment to Sunday's preaching because the wooden tabernacles were so acoustically live. During his preliminaries, Rodeheaver often instructed audiences about how to muffle their coughs. Nurseries were always provided, infants forbidden, and Sunday sometimes appeared rude in his haste to rid the hall of noisy children who had slipped through the ushers. Tabernacle floors were covered with sawdust to dampen the noise of shuffling feet (as well as for its pleasant smell and its ability to hold down the dust of dirt floors), and coming forward during the invitation became known as \\"hitting the sawdust trail.\\"Firstenberger, 37; McLoughlin, 97; Dorsett, 91‚Äì92. The term was first used in a Sunday campaign in Bellingham, Washington, in 1910. Apparently, \\"hitting the sawdust trail\\" had first been used by loggers in the Pacific Northwest to describe following home a trail of previously dropped sawdust through an uncut forest ‚Äî a metaphor for coming from, in Nell Sunday's words, \\"a lost condition to a saved condition.\\" Billy Sunday's tabernacle (Detroit 1916) New York City Tabernacle, 1917 By 1910, Sunday began to conduct meetings (usually longer than a month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and Denver, and then finally, between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City.BGEA New York Crusade During the 1910s, Sunday was front-page news in the cities where he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. Sunday was the subject of over sixty articles in major periodicals, and he was a staple of the religious press regardless of denomination.Dorsett, 92‚Äì93. \\"Scores of newborn boys were named 'Billy Sunday' in his honor, and in Fulton County, Illinois, a recipe for 'Billy Sunday Pudding' was formulated by local residents. The pudding was designed to bake in the oven during his sermon and be ready when the family came home from the meeting.\\" Firstenberger, 39. Over the course of his career, Sunday probably preached to more than one hundred million people face-to-face‚Äîand, to the great majority, without electronic amplification. Vast numbers \\"hit the sawdust trail.\\" Although the usual total given for those who came forward at invitations is an even million, one modern historian estimates the true figure to be closer to 1,250,000.Dorsett, 93; Firstenberger, 39, 120‚Äì123; Lyle W. Dorsett, \\"Billy Sunday\\", American National Biography, 21: 150‚Äì52; Bernard A. Weisberger, They Gathered at the River: The Story of the Great Revivalists and Their Impact upon Religion in America (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1958), 254. Sunday did not preach to a hundred million different individuals but to many of the same people repeatedly over the course of a campaign. Before his death, Sunday estimated that he had preached nearly 20,000 sermons, an average of 42 per month from 1896 to 1935. During his heyday, when he was preaching more than twenty times each week, his crowds were often huge. Even in 1923, well into the period of his decline, 479,300 people attended the 79 meetings of the six-week 1923 Columbia, South Carolina, campaign‚Äì23 times the white population of Columbia. Nevertheless,\\"trail hitters\\" were not necessarily conversions (or even \\"reconsecrations\\") to Christianity. Sometimes whole groups of club members came forward en masse at Sunday's prodding. By 1927, Rodeheaver was complaining that Sunday's invitations had become so general that they were meaningless.McLoughlin, 98‚Äì105, 199‚Äì203; Dorsett, 136. =Wages of success= 1911 bungalow in Winona Lake, Indiana Large crowds and an efficient organization meant that Sunday, the former resident of an orphan home, was soon netting hefty offerings. The first questions about Sunday's income were apparently raised during the Columbus, Ohio, campaign at the turn of 1912‚Äì13. During the Pittsburgh campaign a year later, Sunday spoke four times per day and effectively made $217 per sermon or $870 a day at a time when the average gainfully employed worker made $836 per year. The major cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and New York City gave Sunday even larger offerings. Sunday donated Chicago's offering of $58,000 to Pacific Garden Mission and the $120,500 New York offering to war charities. Nevertheless, between 1908 and 1920, the Sundays earned over a million dollars; an average worker during the same period earned less than $14,000.Dorsett, 90‚Äì91. Billy Sunday at the White House, 1922 Sunday was welcomed into the circle of the social, economic, and political elite. He counted among his neighbors and acquaintances several prominent businessmen. Sunday dined with numerous politicians, including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and counted both Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. as friends.Dorsett, 93‚Äì94, 134, 149‚Äì50. During and after the 1917 Los Angeles campaign, the Sundays visited with Hollywood stars, and members of Sunday's organization played a charity baseball game against a team of show business personalities that included Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.Dorsett, 93, 95; Knickerbocker, 156. The movie stars won, 1‚Äì0, and Sunday jokingly complained that his team could not get a break from the umpires, Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin. The Sundays enjoyed dressing well and dressing their children well; the family sported expensive but tasteful coats, boots, and jewelry. Nell Sunday also bought land as an investment. In 1909, the Sundays bought an apple orchard in Hood River, Oregon, where they vacationed for several years. Although the property sported only a rustic cabin, reporters called it a \\"ranch.\\" Sunday was a soft touch with money and gave away much of his earnings.In 1913, Sunday's mentor, J. Wilbur Chapman, wrote that he could not think of a time that Sunday had \\"had opportunity for conversation\\" that he had not asked, \\"Do you need any money?\\" Frankenburg, \\"Forward.\\" Neither of the Sundays were extravagant spenders. Although Sunday enjoyed driving, the couple never owned a car. In 1911, the Sundays moved to Winona Lake, Indiana, and built an American Craftsman-style bungalow, which they called \\"Mount Hood\\", probably as a reminder of their Oregon vacation cabin. The bungalow, furnished in the popular Arts and Crafts style, had two porches and a terraced garden but only nine rooms, of living space, and no garage.Dorsett,95‚Äì96. A good description of the house and its furnishings is in Firstenberger, 80‚Äì92. In her will, Nell Sunday donated the house and its collection of artifacts as a museum. Religious views Sunday was a conservative evangelical who accepted fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At the turn of the 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by the vast majority of the Protestant churches and their clergy.Firstenberger, 26‚Äì29. Although preached in colloquialisms, Sunday's theology was fairly sophisticated and \\"orthodox in its basic ingredients\\". See Daniel LaRoy Anderson, \\"The Gospel According to Sunday\\", Th.D. dissertation, Dallas Theological Seminary, 199. Sunday was not a separationist as were many Protestants of his era. He went out of his way to avoid criticizing the Roman Catholic Church and even met with Cardinal Gibbons during his 1916 Baltimore campaign. Also, cards filled out by \\"trail hitters\\" were faithfully returned to the church or denomination that the writers had indicated as their choice, including Catholic and Unitarian.Dorsett, 80‚Äì81; Firstenberger, 30. A short but striking first-person account of Sunday's 1915 Syracuse campaign by a Universalist clergyman is Frederick W. Betts, Billy Sunday: The Man and the Method (Boston: Murray Press, 1916.) Betts was clearly disgusted by Sunday but awestruck by the power of his personality and sermons over even his educated acquaintances. Although Sunday was ordained by the Presbyterian Church in 1903, his ministry was nondenominational and he was not a strict Calvinist. He preached that individuals were, at least in part, responsible for their own salvation. \\"Trail hitters\\" were given a four-page tract that stated, \\"if you have done your part (i.e. believe that Christ died in your place, and receive Him as your Saviour and Master) God has done HIS part and imparted to you His own nature.\\"Weisberger, 253. Sunday never attended seminary and made no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, but he had a thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was once charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted agnostic Robert Ingersoll.Dorsett, 77; Firstenberger, 32, 63. Sunday's library included a copy of Thomas W. Hanford, Ingersollia: Gems of Thought from the Lectures, Speeches and Conversations of the Late Col. Robert G. Ingersoll(1899) with underlined text and marginal notes. Sunday's homespun preaching had a wide appeal to his audiences, who were \\"entertained, reproached, exhorted, and astonished.\\"Martin, 138. Sunday claimed to be \\"an old-fashioned preacher of the old-time religion\\"Ellis, 146. and his uncomplicated sermons spoke of a personal God, salvation through Jesus Christ, and following the moral lessons of the Bible. Sunday's theology, although sometimes denigrated as simplistic, was situated within the mainstream Protestantism of his time.Dorsett, 155‚Äì157. Martin, 138‚Äì140. Social and political views Cover of August 1914 issue of The Melting Pot: A Magazine of Protest, edited by Henry M. Tichenor, condemning Sunday as a tool of big business. Forest Home Cemetery, Forest Park, Illinois Sunday was a lifelong Republican, and he espoused the mainstream political and social views of his native Midwest: individualism, competitiveness, personal discipline, and opposition to government regulation.Martin, 126‚Äì127. Writers such as Sinclair Lewis,Sinclair Lewis' novel Babbitt includes a character named Mike Monday, \\"the distinguished evangelist, the best-known Protestant pontiff in America...As a prize-fighter he gained nothing but his crooked nose, his celebrated vocabulary, and his stage-presence. The service of the Lord had been more profitable.\\" In his novel, a visit by Monday is opposed by \\"certain Episcopalian and Congregationalist ministers\\", whom Monday calls \\"a bunch of gospel-pushers with dish-water instead of blood, a gang of squealers that need more dust on the knees of their pants and more hair on their skinny old chests.\\" Lewis's Elmer Gantry is a novel about an evangelist with more than a passing resemblance to Sunday. (Sunday in turn referred to Lewis as a member of \\"Satan's cohort.\\") Elmer Gantry study guide, bookrags.com. Henry M. Tichenor,R. A. Bruns, Preacher: Billy Sunday and Big-Time American Evangelism (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2002), 194‚Äì195. and John Reed attacked Sunday as a tool of big business, and poet Carl Sandburg called him a \\"four-flusher\\" and a \\"bunkshooter.\\"McLoughlin, 223. John Reed, \\"Back of Sunday\\", Metropolitan Magazine (May 1915), 10. Carl Sandburg, \\"To Billy Sunday\\" , 1915. Sandburg wrote, \\"You come along squirting words at us, shaking your fist and calling us all dam fools so fierce the froth slobbers over your lips...always blabbing we're all going to hell straight off and you know all about it...Go ahead and bust all the chairs you want to. Smash a whole wagon load of furniture at every performance. Turn sixty somersaults and stand on your nutty head. If it wasn't for the way you scare the women and kids I'd feel sorry for you and pass the hat. I like to watch a good four-flusher work, but not when he starts people puking and calling for the doctors.\\" Sunday also appears in some modern fiction, both as an historical touchstone and as a metaphorical figure. For example, John Jakes inserts a mention of Sunday in Homeland, his historical novel about Chicago; and Sunday's life is employed metaphorically in Rod Jones' novel Billy Sunday. Jerry Garcia also referred to Billy Sunday in the Grateful Dead song, \\"Ramble On Rose.\\" Nevertheless, Sunday sided with Progressives on some issues. For example, he denounced child labor\\"Men who will gladly draw their check for $10,000 and give it a child's hospital see nothing ridiculous in the fact that the $10,000 for the child's hospital came of out of $200,000 made from a system of child labor which crushes more children in one year than the hospital will heal in ten.\\" Quoted in McLoughlin, 145. and supported urban reform and women's suffrage.Firstenberger, 66‚Äì68; McLoughlin, 140‚Äì143. Sunday condemned capitalists \\"whose private lives are good, but whose public lives are very bad\\", as well as those \\"who would not pick the pockets of one man with the fingers of their hand\\" but who would \\"without hesitation pick the pockets of eighty million people with fingers of their monopoly or commercial advantage.\\"Quoted in McLoughlin, 144‚Äì45. He never lost his sympathy for the poor, and he sincerely tried to bridge the gulf between the races during the zenith of the Jim Crow era,Dorsett, 96‚Äì97, 152‚Äì154. although on at least two occasions in the mid-1920s Sunday received contributions from the Ku Klux Klan.Firstenberger, 29‚Äì30. Sunday apparently never either praised the Klan nor denounced it (McLoughlin, 274‚Äì275). According to Larson, Sunday's Memphis campaign of February 1925 featured both a special night for African Americans and an \\"unofficial Klan night.\\" (). Sunday was a passionate supporter of World War I. In 1918 he said, \\"I tell you it is [Kaiser] Bill against Woodrow, Germany against America, Hell against Heaven.\\" Sunday raised large amounts of money for the troops, sold war bonds, and stumped for recruitment.McLoughlin, 257‚Äì259; Firstenberger, 60‚Äì62; Dorsett, 113‚Äì114. Sunday said, \\"If you turn hell upside down, you will find 'Made in Germany' stamped on the bottom.\\" Ray H. Abrams, Preachers Present Arms (Scottdale, Pennsylvania: Herald Press, 1933), 79. Sunday had been an ardent champion of temperance from his earliest days as an evangelist, and his ministry at the Chicago YMCA had given him first-hand experience with the destructive potential of alcohol. Sunday's most famous sermon was \\"Get on the Water Wagon\\", which he preached on countless occasions with both histrionic emotion and a \\"mountain of economic and moral evidence.\\" Sunday said, \\"I am the sworn, eternal and uncompromising enemy of the Liquor Traffic. I have been, and will go on, fighting that damnable, dirty, rotten business with all the power at my command.\\"Dorsett, 112‚Äì113; Firstenberger, 69; McLaughlin, 180‚Äì184. Sunday preached that \\"whiskey and beer are all right in their place, but their place is in hell.\\"(Compare Christianity and alcohol.) Sunday played a significant role in arousing public interest in Prohibition and in the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919. When the tide of public opinion turned against Prohibition, he continued to support it. After its repeal in 1933, Sunday called for its reintroduction.McLoughlin, 232‚Äì234; Firstenberger, 72. During Prohibition, Sunday's revival theme song, \\"Brighten the Corner Where You Are\\", is said to have become a drinking song in the blind pigs. A line in the popular Frank Sinatra song \\"Chicago\\", written by Fred Fisher in the 1920s, refers to Chicago as \\"the town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down.\\" Sunday also opposed eugenics, recent immigration from southern and eastern Europe,McLoughlin, 146‚Äì48. and the teaching of evolution.Although Sunday was a firm creationist, he believed that the seven days of creation were indeterminate periods and not literal 24-hour days. As proof Sunday quoted 2 Peter 3:8 that \\"one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\\" \\"Nuts for Skeptics to Crack\\", (sermon) May 24, 1917, Papers of William and Helen Sunday, Reel 11. William Jennings Bryan asked Sunday to participate in the Scopes Trial. Although Sunday assured Bryan that \\"all the believing world is back of you in your defense of Christ and the Bible\\", Sunday declined to come to Dayton. Sunday to Bryan, July 4, 1925, William Jennings Bryan Papers, Library of Congress, Box 47. Further, he criticized such popular middle-class amusements as dancing,\\"Sunday said that 'three-fourths of all the fallen women fell as a result of the dance.'\\" Quoted in McLoughlin, 132. Sunday's views were caricatured in P. G. Wodehouse's short story, \\"The Aunt and the Sluggard\\" (My Man Jeeves) in which the fictional revival preacher Jimmy Mundy says that \\"the tango and the fox-trot were devices of the devil to drag people down into the Bottomless Pit. He said that there was more sin in ten minutes with a negro banjo orchestra than in all the ancient revels of Nineveh and Babylon.\\" playing cards, attending the theater, and reading novels.McLoughlin, 132‚Äì135; Firstenberger, 65‚Äì66. However, he believed baseball was a healthy and even patriotic form of recreation, so long as it was not played on Sundays.Knickerbocker, 156‚Äì157. Decline and death Sunday's popularity waned after World War I, when many people in his revival audiences were attracted to radio broadcasts and moving pictures instead.Dorsett, 148.\\"Sabbath church attendance was not greatly affected by the rapid rise of the entertainment industry, but revivals conducted in big tents and tabernacles night after night for several weeks running were definitely undercut when the public found new competitors for their time.\\" The Sundays' health also declined even as they continued to drive themselves through rounds of revivals‚Äîsmaller but also with fewer staff members to assist them. Tragedy marred Sunday's final years. His three sons engaged in many of the activities he preached against, and the Sundays paid blackmail to several women to keep the scandals relatively quiet.Dorsett, 129. In a 1929 letter to his wife, Sunday wrote that \\"all we have earned in the last 5 years has gone to Millie\\", Billy, Jr.'s ex-wife. BS to HTS, Box 4, Folder 32, The Papers of William and Helen Sunday [microfilm] (Wheaton, Illinois: Billy Graham Center, 1978). In 1930, Nora Lynn, their housekeeper and nanny, who had become a virtual member of the family, died. Then the Sundays' daughter, the only child actually raised by Nell, died in 1932 of what seems to have been multiple sclerosis.Dorsett, 129‚Äì130. Their oldest son George, rescued from financial ruin by his parents, committed suicide in 1933.All three of Sunday's sons died violently: George from a \\"fall\\" from a hotel window; Billy, Jr. in an automobile crash after a night of partying; and Paul in an airplane crash. Although Sunday's four children contracted nine marriages, Billy and Nell Sunday had only three grandchildren. The grandchildren, in turn, contracted five marriages that resulted in only one great-grandchild, who apparently died childless. The great-grandchild, Marquis Ashley Sunday, was killed by his lover in San Francisco on March 22, 1982. Therefore, fifty years after his death, Sunday had no known living descendants. Dorsett, 126‚Äì130. Firstenberger, 136‚Äì137, gives the genealogical details. Nevertheless, even as the crowds declined during the last 15 years of his life, Sunday continued accepting preaching invitations and speaking with effect. In early 1935, he had a mild heart attack, and his doctor advised him to stay out of the pulpit. Sunday ignored the advice. He died on November 6, a week after preaching his last sermon on the text \\"What must I do to be saved?\\"Dorsett, 141‚Äì143. Sunday was buried at Forest Home Cemetery, in Forest Park, outside Chicago. According to The New York Times Actually, after resting in the afternoon, Sunday had helped his wife and brother-in-law repot some plants. Afterward, he again went upstairs to rest. Nell brought him his supper, and when she went downstairs to get her own, Sunday cried, \\"Nell! Oh, come quick! I've got an awful pain.\\" Sunday had severe chest pain that spread to both arms. A doctor was called, and he prescribed an ice pack for Sunday's chest. Sunday's pain subsided, and his pulse improved. The doctor left to keep evening appointments with other patients, promising to return. As Nell sat by his side answering letters, Sunday said, \\"I'm getting dizzy, Ma!\\" Those were his last words.

He has maintained a dual career of author of fiction and advocate of paranormal concepts through his best-selling non-fiction books, his Unknown Country web site, and his Internet podcast, Dreamland. Early life and education Strieber was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Kathleen Mary (Drought) and Karl Strieber, a lawyer. He attended Central Catholic High School in San Antonio, Texas. He was educated at the University of Texas at Austin and the London School of Film Technique, graduating from each in 1968. He then worked for several advertising firms in New York City, rising to the level of vice president before leaving in 1977 to pursue a writing career. Early fiction Strieber began his career as a novelist with the horror novels The Wolfen (1978) and The Hunger (1981), both of which were made into feature films, followed by the less successful horror novels Black Magic (1982) and The Night Church (1983). Strieber then turned to speculative fiction with social conscience. Collaborating with James Kunetka, he wrote Warday (1984), about the dangers of limited nuclear warfare, and Nature's End (1986), a novel about environmental apocalypse. He independently authored Wolf of Shadows (1985), a young adult novel set in the aftermath of a nuclear war. In 1986, Strieber's fantasy novel Catmagic was published with co-authorship credited to Jonathan Barry, who was billed as an aerospace industry consultant and a practicing witch. In the 1987 paperback edition, Strieber states that Jonathan Barry is fictitious and that he is the sole author of Catmagic. Strieber's personal publishing company, Walker & Collier, is named after two characters in Catmagic. Later, less successful thrillers by Strieber include Billy (1990), The Wild (1991), Unholy Fire (1992) and The Forbidden Zone (1993). Short stories The author's short stories were collected in the 1997 limited edition volume Evenings with Demons. More recent short stories include \\"The Good Neighbor\\", published in Twilight Zone: 19 Original Stories on the 50th Anniversary, and \\"The Christmas Spirits\\" (2012), a modern retelling of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. Communion and \\"the visitors\\" Strieber contends that he was abducted from his cabin in upstate New York on the evening of December 26, 1985 by non-human beings. He wrote about this experience and related experiences in Communion (1987), his first non-fiction book. Although the book is perceived generally as an account of alien abduction, Strieber draws no conclusions about the identity of the alleged abductors. He refers to the beings as \\"the visitors\\", a name chosen to be as neutral as possible to entertain the possibility that they are not extraterrestrials. Neurologist Steven Novella remarks that the details of Whitley's tale of waking up seemingly paralyzed fits the description of hypnagogia, a fairly common neurological phenomenon that has been mistaken by some for an intervention by demons or aliens. Both the hardcover and paperback edition of Communion reached the number one position on The New York Times Best Seller list (non-fiction), with more than 2 million copies collectively sold. Although published as non-fiction, the book editor of the Los Angeles Times pronounced the follow-up title, Transformation (1988), to be fiction and removed it from the non-fiction best-seller list (it nonetheless made the top 10 on the fiction side of the chart). \\"It's a reprehensible thing,\\" Strieber responded. \\"My book is a true story ... Placing this book on the fiction list is an ugly example of exactly the kind of blind prejudice that has hurt human progress for many generations.\\" Criticism noting the similarity between the non-human beings in Strieber's autobiographical accounts and the non-human beings in his initial horror novels were typically acknowledged by the author as a fair observation, but not indicative of his autobiographical works being fictional: \\"The mysterious small beings that figure prominently in Catmagic seem to be an unconscious rendering of [the visitors], created before I was aware that they may be real.\\" Over the next 24 years (since the 1987 publication of Communion), Strieber wrote four additional autobiographies detailing his experiences with the visitors: Transformation (1988), a direct follow-up; Breakthrough: The Next Step (1995), a reflection on the original events and accounts of the sporadic contact he'd subsequently experienced; The Secret School (1996), in which he examines strange memories from his childhood; and lastly, Solving the Communion Enigma: What Is to Come (2011). In Solving the Communion Enigma, Strieber reflects on how advances in scientific understanding since his 1987 publication may shed light on what he perceived, noting, \\"Among other things, since I wrote Communion, science has determined that parallel universes may be physically real and that time travel may in some way be possible\\". The book is a consolidation of UFO sightings and related phenomena, including crop circles, alien abductions, mutilations and deaths in an attempt to discern any kind of meaningful overall pattern. Strieber concludes that the human species is being shepherded to a higher level of understanding and existence within an endless \\"multiverse\\" of matter, energy, space and time. He also writes more candidly about the deleterious effects his initial experiences had upon him while staying at his upstate New York cabin in the 1980s, noting \\"I was regularly drinking myself to sleep when we were there. I would listen to the radio until late hours, drinking vodka...\\" Page 9: \\"As I have said, it is not at all clear the final resolution of the mystery will involve creatures from another planet. Among other things, since I wrote Communion, science has determined that parallel universes may be physically real and that time travel may in some way be possible.\\"; Page 157: \\"I was regularly drinking myself to sleep...\\" Other visitor-themed books of Strieber's include Majestic (1989), a novel about the Roswell UFO incident; The Communion Letters (1997, reissued in 2003), a collection of letters from readers reporting experiences similar to Strieber's; Confirmation (1998), in which Strieber reviews a variety of evidence that is suggestive of alien contact, and considers what more would be required to provide 'confirmation'; The Grays (2006) a novel in which his impressions of alien contact are presented through a fictional thriller/espionage narrative, and; Hybrids (2011) a fictional narrative that imagines human/alien hybrids being born into the modern world. Additional visitor-themed writings include a screenplay for the 1989 film Communion, directed by Philippe Mora and starring Christopher Walken as Strieber. The movie covers material from the books Communion and Transformation. Strieber has stated that he was dissatisfied with the film, which utilized scenes of improvised dialogue and includes themes not present in his books. Strieber also wrote a screenplay for his novel Majestic, which to date has not been filmed. Whitley Strieber has repeatedly expressed frustration that his experiences have been taken as \\"alien contact\\" when he does not actually know what they were. Strieber has reported anomalous childhood experiences and suggested that he may have suffered some sort of early interference by intelligence or military agencies.\\"The Boy in the Box,\\" Whitley's Journal, Friday, March 14, 2003 He was extensively tested for temporal lobe epilepsy and other brain abnormalities at his own request, but his brain was found to be functioning normally. The results of these tests were reported in his book Transformation. The Whitman Massacre In Communion, Strieber wrote of having told friends over the years that he had witnessed the University of Texas tower shooting in Austin, Texas on August 1, 1966, when he had in fact not been on campus that day: Strieber presents his claim to have witnessed the Whitman shooting in Communion in the context of alien abduction screen memories, expressing puzzlement at having repeated this false claim over the years. In two interviews prior to Communion, however, Strieber described in graphic detail what he purportedly witnessed. In a 1985 interview with Douglas Winter published in Faces of Fear, Strieber described: Critics including panelists on the British television discussion programme After Dark questioned Strieber about his statements in Communion about not having been at the Whitman shooting.After Dark, produced by Open Media for Channel 4, 18 November 1989. Strieber announced that in his latest book, Transformation, he had changed his mind and decided he had witnessed the shooting. Despite this, according to public information, no \\"little boy on a bicycle\\" was killed by Whitman that day. Further, according to Ed Conroy in his Report on Communion, Strieber's mother stated during an interview that Strieber had been in Austin the day of the shooting, but not on campus.Ed Conroy, Report on Communion, 1989. The Master of the Key In 2001, Strieber self-published a book entitled The Key in which he claimed that while on a book tour for his book Confirmation, he was visited in the early morning of June 6, 1998, at his Toronto hotel room by an unknown man who presented him with a \\"new image of God\\". Strieber engaged the man in dialogue for \\"half an hour\\" though Strieber also conceded that \\"once our conversation was transcribed, it became obvious that more time was involved\\" and \\"he must have been with me for at least two hours\\". Subjects discussed included the Holocaust, sudden climate change, the afterlife, psychic ability, UFOs, and using the human soul in machines. According to Strieber, the man did not give his name, and in the book Strieber refers to him as Master of the Key. While he was writing the book, Strieber said that unlike other events he had experienced \\"the reality of this one isn't in question.\\"Excerpt from Whitleysworld News e-mail newsletter 14 Sept 2000. Retrieved from beyondcommunion.com In the section of The Key entitled The Conversation, Strieber presented a transcription of the conversation which Strieber has claimed is \\"80 to 90 percent accurate\\", \\"90% accurate or more\\". In 2011, Tarcher/Penguin printed a new edition of The Key, which contained significant differences with the version of the transcription contained in Strieber's original Walker & Collier edition. In response, Strieber alleged that his own 2001 self-published edition had been \\"censored\\" by \\"sinister forces\\". Current works Whitley Strieber is currently the host of the spiritual and science-themed internet podcast, Dreamland, available on a weekly basis from his website, Unknown Country. The program was a former companion show to Coast to Coast AM, with both shows founded by broadcaster Art Bell, before being taken on by Strieber in 1999. Strieber has also continued writing novels, including The Last Vampire (2001), and Lilith's Dream (2003), both being sequels to his 1981 vampire novel The Hunger. As well, he has authored 2012: The War For Souls (2007), a horror novel about an interdimensional invasion, and Critical Mass (2009), a thriller about nuclear terrorism. Strieber also co-authored the graphic novel The Nye Incidents (2008), along with co-authors Craig Spector and Guss Floor. His novel, The Omega Point, is a novel \\"based on a hidden connection between 2012 and the Book of Revelation\\".\\"Why is the Middle East Exploding?\\" Whitley's Journal, Wednesday, February 2, 2011 This title released in 2010 is Strieber's second novel dealing with the subject of 2012, the first being his novel 2012: The War for Souls. An entry in the popular teen-lit genre, Melody Burning, was published in late 2011. The story centers on a feral teenager who lives within a skyrise building unnoticed, and a new tenant, a pop-star named Melody, with whom he falls in love. In 2012, Strieber began an alien-themed thriller series called 'Alien Hunter,' the first volume of which was published in August 2013. A series based on the book was released by SyFy in April 2016 called Hunters. The second volume in the series, Alien Hunter: Underworld, was published in August 2014. In March 2014, Strieber and his wife Anne published an account of her illness called Miraculous Journey. Mrs. Strieber experienced a cerebral hemorrhage in 2004, and in 2013 underwent treatment for a brain tumor. Strieber collaborated with religious scholar Jeffrey J. Kripal on 2016's Super Natural: A New Vision of the Unexplained, a study of occultism, supernatural experiences, and parapsychology that explores \\"why the supernatural is neither fantasy nor fiction but a vital and authentic aspect of life\\". Media appearances On November 1989 Strieber made an extended appearance on the British television discussion programme After Dark alongside others including astronaut Buzz Aldrin.Website of production company Open Media, see also List of After Dark editions Strieber, and perhaps his wife Anne, made a cameo appearance in the 2009 movie Race to Witch Mountain. Television appearances during the publication of Communion were numerous and included The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. He has made appearances (including a 2006 interview on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson) in support of his newer novels. He has been featured many times on the overnight radio show Coast to Coast AM, both as guest and guest-host. On April 6, 2013 he did a two-hour interview with John B. Wells. Cultural influences In the TV series Babylon 5, there is an alien race that is similar to the Greys in Communion. This race is named the Streibs after Whitley Strieber.IMDb 'trivia' for B5 season 2, episode 11, \\"All Alone in the Night\\" (1995). In an episode of The X-Files, \\"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\\", the cover of the book From Outer Space is a parody of the cover of Communion (the difference being that the alien on the cover is depicted smoking a cigarette). In the 120th book in The Hardy Boys series, The Case of the Cosmic Kidnapping (1993), the character of \\"Hodding Wheatley\\", a Connecticut-based writer who had undergone UFO experiences, is inspired by Strieber, as indicated by the surname of the character \\"Wheatley\\". In Search of Truth, a 2001 concept album by Swedish progressive metal band Evergrey, was inspired by the ideas presented in Communion. The post-punk dance music group The Mekano Set cite Whitley Strieber's non-fiction work as an influence on their work. They wrote a tribute to Strieber for their 2013 album The Three Thieves (a reference to characters from Strieber's novel The Grays) entitled What is it Whit? The closing track of U.N.K.L.E. debut album \\"Psyence Fiction\\" (1998) features vocals from Whitley Strieber, taken from a weekend edition of Art Bell‚Äôs Coast to Coast AM nightly radio talk show. Personal life Whitley Strieber is currently a practicing Catholic. He is also associated with the Gurdjieff Foundation. He left regular work in the Foundation shortly before the experiences reported in Communion but remains involved in the mystical teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky and makes frequent references to them in his non-fiction writings. Strieber was married to Anne Strieber until her death in 2015. According to his website, he lives in California as of April 2019.

R. Johnson, American Flying Boats and Amphibious Aircraft: An Illustrated History, McFarland and Company, Inc., It differs from a floatplane as it uses a purpose-designed fuselage which can float, granting the aircraft buoyancy. Flying boats may be stabilized by under-wing floats or by wing-like projections (called sponsons) from the fuselage. Flying boats were some of the largest aircraft of the first half of the 20th century, exceeded in size only by bombers developed during World War II. Their advantage lay in using water instead of expensive land- based runways, making them the basis for international airlines in the interwar period. They were also commonly used for maritime patrol and air-sea rescue. Their use gradually trailed off after World War II, partially because of the investments in airports during the war. In the 21st century, flying boats maintain a few niche uses, such as dropping water on forest fires, air transport around archipelagos, and access to undeveloped areas. Many modern seaplane variants, whether float or flying boat types, are convertible amphibious aircraft where either landing gear or flotation modes may be used to land and take off. History =Early pioneers= Gabriel Voisin, air pioneer, who made one of the earliest flights in a seaplane, with Henry Farman (left), in 1908. The Frenchman Alphonse P√©naud filed the first patent for a flying machine with a boat hull and retractable landing gear in 1876, but Austrian Wilhelm Kress is credited with building the first seaplane Drachenflieger in 1898, although its two 30 hp Daimler engines were inadequate for take-off and it later sank when one of its two floats collapsed.Flying Boats & Seaplanes: A History from 1905, St√©phane Nicolaou On 6 June 1905 Gabriel Voisin took off and landed on the River Seine with a towed kite glider on floats. The first of his unpowered flights was 150 yards. He later built a powered floatplane in partnership with Louis Bl√©riot, but the machine was unsuccessful. Other pioneers also attempted to attach floats to aircraft in Britain, Australia, France and the USA. On 28 March 1910 Frenchman Henri Fabre flew the first successful powered seaplane, the Gnome Omega-powered hydravion, a trimaran floatplane.Naughton, Russell. Henri Fabre (1882‚Äì1984).\\" Monash University Centre for Telecommunications and Information Engineering, 15 May 2002. Retrieved: 9 May 2008 Fabre's first successful take off and landing by a powered seaplane inspired other aviators and he designed floats for several other flyers. The first hydro-aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March 1912, featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre, Curtiss, Tellier and Farman. This led to the first scheduled seaplane passenger services at Aix- les-Bains, using a five-seat Sanchez-Besa from 1 August 1912. The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in 1912. In 1911‚Äì12 Fran√ßois Denhaut constructed the first seaplane with a fuselage forming a hull, using various designs to give hydrodynamic lift at take-off. Its first successful flight was on 13 April 1912. Throughout 1910 and 1911 American pioneering aviator Glenn Curtiss developed his floatplane into the successful Curtiss Model D land-plane, which used a larger central float and sponsons. Combining floats with wheels, he made the first amphibian flights in February 1911 and was awarded the first Collier Trophy for US flight achievement. From 1912 his experiments with a hulled seaplane resulted in the 1913 Model E and Model F, which he called \\"flying-boats\\". In February 1911 the United States Navy took delivery of the Curtiss Model E, and soon tested landings on and take-offs from ships using the Curtiss Model D. In Britain, Captain Edward Wakefield and Oscar Gnosspelius began to explore the feasibility of flight from water in 1908. They decided to make use of Windermere in the Lake District, England's largest lake. The latter's first attempts to fly attracted large crowds, though the aircraft failed to take off and required a re-design of the floats incorporating features of Borwick's successful speed-boat hulls. Meanwhile, Wakefield ordered a floatplane similar to the design of the 1910 Fabre Hydravion. By November 1911, both Gnosspelius and Wakefield had aircraft capable of flight from water and awaited suitable weather conditions. Gnosspelius's flight was short-lived as the aircraft crashed into the lake. Wakefield's pilot however, taking advantage of a light northerly wind, successfully took off and flew at a height of 50 feet to Ferry Nab, where he made a wide turn and returned for a perfect landing on the lake's surface. In Switzerland, Emile Tadd√©oli equipped the Dufaux 4 biplane with swimmers and successfully took off in 1912. A seaplane was used during the Balkan Wars in 1913, when a Greek \\"Astra Hydravion\\" did a reconnaissance of the Turkish fleet and dropped 4 bombs.Anonymous (2009) The establishment of the Navy Airforce, Fox2 Magazine (in Greek language) =Birth of an industry= In 1913, the Daily Mail newspaper put up a ¬£10,000 prize for the first non-stop aerial crossing of the Atlantic which was soon \\"enhanced by a further sum\\" from the Women's Aerial League of Great Britain. Curtiss NC Flying Boat \\"NC-3\\" skims across the water before takeoff, 1919 American businessman Rodman Wanamaker became determined that the prize should go to an American aircraft and commissioned the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company to design and build an aircraft capable of making the flight. Curtiss' development of the Flying Fish flying boat in 1913 brought him into contact with John Cyril Porte, a retired Royal Navy Lieutenant, aircraft designer and test pilot who was to become an influential British aviation pioneer. Recognising that many of the early accidents were attributable to a poor understanding of handling while in contact with the water, the pair's efforts went into developing practical hull designs to make the transatlantic crossing possible.The Felixstowe Flying Boats, Flight 2 December 1955 At the same time the British boat building firm J. Samuel White of Cowes on the Isle of Wight set up a new aircraft division and produced a flying boat in the United Kingdom. This was displayed at the London Air Show at Olympia in 1913.Hull, Norman. Flying Boats of the Solent: A Portrait of a Golden Age of Air Travel (Aviation Heritage). Great Addington, Kettering, Northants, UK: Silver Link Publishing, 2002. . In that same year, a collaboration between the S. E. Saunders boatyard of East Cowes and the Sopwith Aviation Company produced the \\"Bat Boat\\", an aircraft with a consuta laminated hull that could operate from land or on water, which today we call an amphibious aircraft. The \\"Bat Boat\\" completed several landings on sea and on land and was duly awarded the Mortimer Singer Prize. It was the first all- British aeroplane capable of making six return flights over five miles within five hours. In the U.S. Wanamaker's commission built on Glen Curtiss' previous development and experience with the Model F for the U.S. Navy which rapidly resulted in the America, designed under Porte's supervision following his study and rearrangement of the flight plan; the aircraft was a conventional biplane design with two-bay, unstaggered wings of unequal span with two pusher inline engines mounted side-by-side above the fuselage in the interplane gap. Wingtip pontoons were attached directly below the lower wings near their tips. The design (later developed into the Model H), resembled Curtiss' earlier flying boats, but was built considerably larger so it could carry enough fuel to cover . The three crew members were accommodated in a fully enclosed cabin. Trials of the America began 23 June 1914 with Porte also as Chief Test Pilot; testing soon revealed serious shortcomings in the design; it was under- powered, so the engines were replaced with more powerful engines mounted in a tractor configuration. There was also a tendency for the nose of the aircraft to try to submerge as engine power increased while taxiing on water. This phenomenon had not been encountered before, since Curtiss' earlier designs had not used such powerful engines nor large fuel/cargo loads and so were relatively more buoyant. In order to counteract this effect, Curtiss fitted fins to the sides of the bow to add hydrodynamic lift, but soon replaced these with sponsons, a type of underwater pontoon mounted in pairs on either side of a hull. These sponsons (or their engineering equivalents) and the flared, notched hull would remain a prominent feature of flying boat hull design in the decades to follow. With the problem resolved, preparations for the crossing resumed. While the craft was found to handle \\"heavily\\" on takeoff, and required rather longer take-off distances than expected, the full moon on 5 August 1914 was selected for the trans-Atlantic flight; Porte was to pilot the America with George Hallett as co-pilot and mechanic. =World War I= Curtiss and Porte's plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Porte sailed for England on 4 August 1914 and rejoined the Navy, as a member of the Royal Naval Air Service. Appointed Squadron Commander of Royal Navy Air Station Hendon, he soon convinced the Admiralty of the potential of flying boats and was put in charge of the naval air station at Felixstowe in 1915. Porte persuaded the Admiralty to commandeer (and later, purchase) the America and a sister craft from Curtiss. This was followed by an order for 12 more similar aircraft, one Model H-2 and the remaining as Model H-4's. Four examples of the latter were assembled in the UK by Saunders. All of these were similar to the design of the America and, indeed, were all referred to as Americas in Royal Navy service. The engines, however, were changed from the under-powered 160 hp Curtiss engines to 250 hp Rolls-Royce Falcon engines. The initial batch was followed by an order for 50 more (totalling 64 Americas overall during the war). Porte also acquired permission to modify and experiment with the Curtiss aircraft. The Curtiss H-4s were soon found to have a number of problems; they were underpowered, their hulls were too weak for sustained operations and they had poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off.Bruce Flight 2 December 1955, p.844.London 2003, pp. 16‚Äì17. One flying boat pilot, Major Theodore Douglas Hallam, wrote that they were \\"comic machines, weighing well under two tons; with two comic engines giving, when they functioned, 180 horsepower; and comic control, being nose heavy with engines on and tail heavy in a glide.\\"Hallam 1919, pp. 21‚Äì22. Felixstowe F.2A, the first production seaplane, and the basis for future development.left At Felixstowe, Porte made advances in flying boat design and developed a practical hull design with the distinctive \\"Felixstowe notch\\".\\"Felixstowe.\\" NASM. Retrieved: 20 May 2012. Porte's first design to be implemented in Felixstowe was the Felixstowe Porte Baby, a large, three-engined biplane flying-boat, powered by one central pusher and two outboard tractor Rolls- Royce Eagle engines. Porte modified an H-4 with a new hull whose improved hydrodynamic qualities made taxiing, take-off and landing much more practical, and called it the Felixstowe F.1. Porte's innovation of the \\"Felixstowe notch\\" enabled the craft to overcome suction from the water more quickly and break free for flight much more easily. This made operating the craft far safer and more reliable. The \\"notch\\" breakthrough would soon after evolve into a \\"step\\", with the rear section of the lower hull sharply recessed above the forward lower hull section, and that characteristic became a feature of both flying boat hulls and seaplane floats. The resulting aircraft would be large enough to carry sufficient fuel to fly long distances and could berth alongside ships to take on more fuel. Porte then designed a similar hull for the larger Curtiss H-12 flying boat which, while larger and more capable than the H-4s, shared failings of a weak hull and poor water handling. The combination of the new Porte-designed hull, this time fitted with two steps, with the wings of the H-12 and a new tail, and powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines, was named the Felixstowe F.2 and first flew in July 1916,London 2003, pp. 24‚Äì25. proving greatly superior to the Curtiss on which it was based. It was used as the basis for all future designs.Bruce Flight 2 December 1955, p. 846. It entered production as the Felixstowe F.2A, being used as a patrol aircraft, with about 100 being completed by the end of World War I. Another seventy were built, and these were followed by two F.2c, which were built at Felixstowe. In February 1917, the first prototype of the Felixstowe F.3 was flown. It was larger and heavier than the F.2, giving it greater range and heavier bomb load, but poorer agility. Approximately 100 Felixstowe F.3s were produced before the end of the war. The Felixstowe F.5, designed by Lieutenant Commander John Cyril Porte at the Seaplane Experimental Station, Felixstowe The Felixstowe F.5 was intended to combine the good qualities of the F.2 and F.3, with the prototype first flying in May 1918. The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but, to ease production, the production version was modified to make extensive use of components from the F.3, which resulted in lower performance than the F.2A or F.3. Porte's final design at the Seaplane Experimental Station was the 123 ft-span five-engined Felixstowe Fury triplane (also known as the \\"Porte Super-Baby\\" or \\"PSB\\").\\"Felixstowe Flying-Boats.\\" Will Higgs Co, United Kingdom. Retrieved: 24 December 2009. F.2, F.3, and F.5 flying boats were extensively employed by the Royal Navy for coastal patrols, and to search for German U-boats. In 1918 they were towed on lighters towards the northern German ports to extend their range; on 4 June 1918 this resulted in three F.2As engaging in a dogfight with ten German seaplanes, shooting down two confirmed and four probables at no loss. As a result of this action, British flying boats were dazzle-painted to aid identification in combat. Felixstowe F5L under construction at the Naval Aircraft Factory, Philadelphia, circa 1920. The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company independently developed its designs into the small Model \\"F\\", the larger Model \\"K\\" (several of which were sold to the Russian Naval Air Service), and the Model \\"C\\" for the U.S. Navy. Curtiss among others also built the Felixstowe F.5 as the Curtiss F5L, based on the final Porte hull designs and powered by American Liberty engines. Meanwhile, the pioneering flying boat designs of Fran√ßois Denhaut had been steadily developed by the Franco-British Aviation Company into a range of practical craft. Smaller than the Felixstowes, several thousand FBAs served with almost all of the Allied forces as reconnaissance craft, patrolling the North Sea, Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans. In Italy several seaplanes were developed, starting with the L series, and progressing with the M series. The Macchi M.5 in particular was extremely manoeuvrable and agile and matched the land-based aircraft it had to fight. 244 were built in total. Towards the end of World War I, the aircraft were flown by the Italian Navy Aviation, the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps airmen. Ensign Charles Hammann won the first Medal of Honor awarded to a United States naval aviator in an M.5 The Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company built some of the biggest sea planes of the time in Keyport, New Jersey. Mr.Uppercu built the factory on a 66-acre site in 1917 and Built the Aeromarine 75 and Aeromarine AMC flying Boats which with Aeromarine West Indies Airways flew Air Mail to Florida, Bahamas, and Cuba along with being passenger carriers. The German aircraft manufacturing company Hansa- Brandenburg built flying boats starting with the model Hansa-Brandenburg GW in 1916. The Austro-Hungarian firm, Lohner-Werke began building flying boats, starting with the Lohner E in 1914 and the later (1915) influential Lohner L version. = Between the wars = Two Supermarine Southamptons In September 1919 British company Supermarine started operating the first flying boat service in the world, from Woolston to Le Havre in France, but it was short- lived. A Curtiss NC-4 became the first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1919, crossing via the Azores. Of the four that made the attempt, only one completed the flight. Before the development of highly reliable aircraft, the ability to land on water was a desirable safety feature for transoceanic travel. In 1923, the first successful commercial flying boat service was introduced with flights to and from the Channel Islands. The British aviation industry was experiencing rapid growth. The Government decided that nationalization was necessary and ordered five aviation companies to merge to form the state-owned Imperial Airways of London (IAL). IAL became the international flag-carrying British airline, providing flying boat passenger and mail transport links between Britain and South Africa using aircraft such as the Short S.8 Calcutta. In 1928, four Supermarine Southampton flying boats of the RAF Far East flight arrived in Melbourne, Australia. The flight was considered proof that flying boats had evolved to become reliable means of long distance transport. Flying boats of Ad Astra Aero S.A. at Z√ºrichhorn water airport, Uetliberg in the background (~1920) In the 1930s, flying boats made it possible to have regular air transport between the U.S. and Europe, opening up new air travel routes to South America, Africa, and Asia. Foynes, Ireland and Botwood, Newfoundland and Labrador were the termini for many early transatlantic flights. In areas where there were no airfields for land-based aircraft, flying boats could stop at small island, river, lake or coastal stations to refuel and resupply. The Pan Am Boeing 314 \\"Clipper\\" planes brought exotic destinations like the Far East within reach of air travelers and came to represent the romance of flight. By 1931, mail from Australia was reaching Britain in just 16 days ‚Äì less than half the time taken by sea. In that year, government tenders on both sides of the world invited applications to run new passenger and mail services between the ends of the British Empire, and Qantas and IAL were successful with a joint bid. A company under combined ownership was then formed, Qantas Empire Airways. The new ten- day service between Rose Bay, New South Wales (near Sydney) and Southampton was such a success with letter-writers that before long the volume of mail was exceeding aircraft storage space. A solution to the problem was found by the British government, who in 1933 had requested aviation manufacturer Short Brothers to design a big new long-range monoplane for use by IAL. Partner Qantas agreed to the initiative and undertook to purchase six of the new Short S23 \\"C\\" class or \\"Empire\\" flying boats. Dornier Do X over a seaport town in the Baltic, 1930 Delivering the mail as quickly as possible generated a lot of competition and some innovative designs. One variant of the Short Empire flying boats was the strange-looking \\"Maia and Mercury\\". It was a four-engined floatplane \\"Mercury\\" (the winged messenger) fixed on top of \\"Maia\\", a heavily modified Short Empire flying boat. The larger Maia took off, carrying the smaller Mercury loaded to a weight greater than it could take off with. This allowed the Mercury to carry sufficient fuel for a direct trans-Atlantic flight with the mail. Unfortunately this was of limited usefulness, and the Mercury had to be returned from America by ship. The Mercury did set a number of distance records before in-flight refuelling was adopted. Sir Alan Cobham devised a method of in-flight refuelling in the 1930s. In the air, the Short Empire could be loaded with more fuel than it could take off with. Short Empire flying boats serving the trans-Atlantic crossing were refueled over Foynes; with the extra fuel load, they could make a direct trans-Atlantic flight. A Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow was used as the fuel tanker. The German Dornier Do X flying boat was noticeably different from its UK and U.S.-built counterparts. It had wing-like protrusions from the fuselage, called sponsons, to stabilize it on the water without the need for wing-mounted outboard floats. This feature was pioneered by Claudius Dornier during World War I on his Dornier Rs. I giant flying boat, and perfected on the Dornier Wal in 1924. The enormous Do X was powered by 12 engines and once carried 170 persons as a publicity stunt. It flew to America in 1930‚Äì31, crossing the Atlantic via an indirect route over 9 months. It was the largest flying boat of its time, but was severely underpowered and was limited by a very low operational ceiling. Only three were built, with a variety of different engines installed, in an attempt to overcome the lack of power. Two of these were sold to Italy. The Dornier Wal was \\"easily the greatest commercial success in the history of marine aviation\\".St√©phane Nicolaou FLYING BOATS & SEAPLANES A History from 1905, Bay View Books Ltd Bideford Devon 1998 (English translation, originally published in French - copyright ETAI, Paris 1996) Over 250 were built in Italy, Spain, Japan, The Netherlands and Germany. Numerous airlines operated the Dornier Wal on scheduled passenger and mail services.Gandt, Robert L. CHINA CLIPPER - The Age of the Great Flying Boats, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis Maryland 1991 Wals were used by explorers, for a number of pioneering flights, and by the military in many countries. Though having first flown in 1922, from 1934 to 1938 Wals operated the over-water sectors of the Deutsche Luft Hansa South Atlantic Airmail service.James W. Graue & John Duggan \\"Deutsche Lufthansa South Atlantic Airmail Service 1934 - 1939\\", Zeppelin Study Group, Ickenham, UK 2000 =World War II= PBY Catalinaleft The military value of flying boats was well-recognized, and every country bordering on water operated them in a military capacity at the outbreak of the war. They were utilized in various tasks from anti-submarine patrol to air-sea rescue and gunfire spotting for battleships. Aircraft such as the PBM Mariner patrol bomber, PBY Catalina, Short Sunderland, and Grumman Goose recovered downed airmen and operated as scout aircraft over the vast distances of the Pacific Theater and the Atlantic. They also sank numerous submarines and found enemy ships. In May 1941 the German battleship Bismarck was discovered by a PBY Catalina flying out of Castle Archdale Flying boat base, Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. The largest flying boat of the war was the Blohm & Voss BV 238, which was also the heaviest plane to fly during World War II and the largest aircraft built and flown by any of the Axis Powers. right In November 1939, IAL was restructured into three separate companies: British European Airways, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), and British South American Airways (which merged with BOAC in 1949), with the change being made official on 1 April 1940. BOAC continued to operate flying boat services from the (slightly) safer confines of Poole Harbour during wartime, returning to Southampton in 1947. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, the Mediterranean was closed to allied planes and BOAC and Qantas operated the Horseshoe Route between Durban and Sydney using Short Empire flying boats. The Martin Company produced the prototype XPB2M Mars based on their PBM Mariner patrol bomber, with flight tests between 1941 and 1943. The Mars was converted by the Navy into a transport aircraft designated the XPB2M-1R. Satisfied with the performance, 20 of the modified JRM-1 Mars were ordered. The first, named Hawaii Mars, was delivered in June 1945, but the Navy scaled back their order at the end of World War II, buying only the five aircraft which were then on the production line. The five Mars were completed, and the last delivered in 1947.Goebel, Greg. \\"The Martin Mariner, Mars, & Marlin Flying Boats.\\" Vectorsite. Retrieved: 20 May 2012. =Post- War= Hughes H-4 Hercules Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 After World War II the use of flying boats rapidly declined for several reasons. The ability to land on water became less of an advantage owing to the considerable increase in the number and length of land based runways during World War II. Further, as the reliability, speed, and range of land-based aircraft increased, the commercial competitiveness of flying boats diminished; their design compromised aerodynamic efficiency and speed to accomplish the feat of waterborne takeoff and landing. Competing with new civilian jet aircraft like the de Havilland Comet and Boeing 707 proved impossible. The Hughes H-4 Hercules, in development in the U.S. during the war, was even larger than the BV 238 but it did not fly until 1947. The Spruce Goose, as the 180-ton H-4 was nicknamed, was the largest flying boat ever to fly. Carried out during Senate hearings into Hughes use of government funds on its construction, the short hop of about a mile at 70 ft above the water by the \\"Flying Lumberyard\\" was claimed by Hughes as vindication of his efforts. Cutbacks in expenditure after the war and the disappearance of its intended mission as a transatlantic transport left it no purpose.Its claim to true flying status is disputed as it made but one short flight in its life In 1944, the Royal Air Force began development of a small jet-powered flying boat that it intended to use as an air defence aircraft optimised for the Pacific, where the relatively calm sea conditions made the use of seaplanes easier. By making the aircraft jet powered, it was possible to design it with a hull rather than making it a floatplane. The Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 prototype first flew in 1947 and was relatively successful in terms of its performance and handling. However, by the end of the war, carrier based aircraft were becoming more sophisticated, and the need for the SR.A/1 evaporated. During the Berlin Airlift (which lasted from June 1948 until August 1949) 10 Sunderlands and two Hythes were used to transport goods from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to isolated Berlin, landing on the Havelsee beside RAF Gatow until it iced over. The Sunderlands were particularly used for transporting salt, as their airframes were already protected against corrosion from seawater. Transporting salt in standard aircraft risked rapid and severe structural corrosion in the event of a spillage. In addition, three Aquila Airways flying boats were used during the airlift. This is the only known operational use of flying boats within central Europe. The U.S. Navy continued to operate flying boats (notably the Martin P5M Marlin) until the late 1960s. The Navy even attempted to build a jet- powered seaplane bomber, the Martin Seamaster. BOAC ceased flying boat services out of Southampton in November 1950. Bucking the trend, in 1948 Aquila Airways was founded to serve destinations that were still inaccessible to land-based aircraft. This company operated Short S.25 and Short S.45 flying boats out of Southampton on routes to Madeira, Las Palmas, Lisbon, Jersey, Majorca, Marseille, Capri, Genoa, Montreux and Santa Margherita. From 1950 to 1957, Aquila also operated a service from Southampton to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The flying boats of Aquila Airways were also chartered for one-off trips, usually to deploy troops where scheduled services did not exist or where there were political considerations. The longest charter, in 1952, was from Southampton to the Falkland Islands. In 1953 the flying boats were chartered for troop deployment trips to Freetown and Lagos and there was a special trip from Hull to Helsinki to relocate a ship's crew. The airline ceased operations on 30 September 1958. Saunders-Roe Princess G-ALUN at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September 1953 The technically advanced Saunders-Roe Princess first flew in 1952 and later received a certificate of airworthiness. Despite being the pinnacle of flying boat development none were sold, though Aquila Airways reportedly attempted to buy them. Of the three Princesses that were built, two never flew, and all were scrapped in 1967. Ansett Australia operated a flying boat service from Rose Bay to Lord Howe Island until 1974, using Short Sandringhams. =Flying boats today= The shape of the Short Empire, a British flying boat of the 1930s was a harbinger of the shape of 20th century aircraft yet to come. Today, however, true flying boats have largely been replaced by seaplanes with floats and amphibious aircraft with wheels. The Beriev Be-200 twin-jet amphibious aircraft has been one of the closest \\"living\\" descendants of the earlier flying boats, along with the larger amphibious planes used for fighting forest fires. There are also several experimental/kit amphibians such as the Volmer Sportsman, Quikkit Glass Goose, Airmax Sea Max, Aeroprakt A-24, and Seawind 300C. The ShinMaywa US-2 is a large STOL amphibious aircraft designed for air-sea rescue work. The US-2 is operated by the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force. The Canadair CL-215 and successor Bombardier 415 are examples of modern flying boats and are used for forest fire suppression. Dornier announced plans in May 2010 to build CD2 SeaStar composite flying boats in Quebec, Canada. The Chinese state owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China is set to launch a massive new AVIC AG600 amphibious airplane in 2016. The ICON A5 is an amphibious aircraft in the light-sport class.

The gulf was formed within a relatively young but now inactive Gulf of Suez Rift rift basin, dating back about 26 million years.http://geoinfo.amu.edu.pl/wpk/geos/GEO_2/GEO_PLATE_T-37.HTML Detailed geological information on the Gulf It stretches some north by northwest, terminating at the Egyptian city of Suez and the entrance to the Suez Canal. Along the mid-line of the gulf is the boundary between Africa and Asia. The entrance of the gulf lies atop the mature Gemsa oil and gas field. The gulf is considered one of the world's important maritime zones due to being an entrance to the Suez Canal. Geography The gulf occupies the northwestern arm of the Red Sea between Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. It is the third arm of the triple junction rift system, the second arm being the Gulf of Aqaba. The length of the gulf, from its mouth at the Strait of Gubal (alternate name: Strait of Jubal) to its head at the city of Suez, is , and it varies in width from . =Extent= The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the gulf as \\"A line running from Ras Muhammed (27¬∞43'N) to the South point of Shadwan Island (34¬∞02'E) and thence Westward on a parallel (27¬∞27'N) to the coast of Africa\\".

He has been called \\"...the most illustrious exponent of the revival of liturgical poetry which the twelfth century affords.\\" Life Adam of Saint Victor was born in the latter part of the eleventh century, probably at Paris, where he was educated. The first reference to him dates from 1098, in the archives of Notre Dame Cathedral, where he held office first as a subdeacon and later as a precentor. He left the cathedral for the Abbey of Saint Victor around 1133, probably because of his attempts at imposing the Rule of St Augustine at the cathedral. Adam likely had contact with a number of important theologians, poets, and musicians of his day, including Peter Abelard and Hugh of St Victor, and he may have taught Albertus Parisiensis. According to John Julian, \\"His principal merits may be described as comprising terseness and felicity of expression; deep and accurate knowledge of Scripture, especially its typology; smoothness of versification; richness of rhyme, accumulating gradually as he nears the conclusion of a Sequence; and a spirit of devotion breathing throughout his work, that assures the reader that his work is \\"a labour of love.\\"Julian, John. \\"Adam of St. Victor\\", Dictionary of Hymnology, 1907 He lived in the abbey, which was somewhat of a theological center, then in the suburbs of Paris but included in it subsequently through the city's growth.A'Becket, John Joseph. \\"Adam of St. Victor.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 15 January 2020 He died there some time between 1172 and 1192. Anglican Archbishop Richard Chenevix Trench characterized Adam of Saint Victor as \\"the foremost among the sacred Latin poets of the Middle Ages\\" In Mont Saint Michel and Chartres, Henry Adams wrote that Adam \\"aimed at obtaining his effect from the skillful use of the Latin sonorities for purposes of the chant.\\" Works Adam of St Victor's surviving works are sequences for liturgical use, not theological treatises.These texts were gradually rediscovered in the nineteenth century.The critical edition of these texts is Jean Grosfillier, ed, Les sequences d'Adam de Saint-Victor: √âtude litt√©raire (po√©tique et rh√©torique). Textes et traductions, commentaires, Bibliotheca Victorina 20, (Turnhout: Brepols, 2008), pp252-481. They are now fully translated in Adam of Saint-Victor, Sequences. Introduction, Text, Translation, and Notes by Juliet Mousseau, Dallas Medieval Texts, (Leuven: Peeters, 2011). In addition, Hugh Feiss, On Love, (2010), p71, argues that three additional Marian sequences seem likely to be by Adam of St Victor. The Latin text is in Bernadette Joll√®s, ed, Quatorze proses du XIIe si√®cle √† louange de Marie, (Turnhout: Brepols, 1994). Jodocus Clichtovaeus, a Catholic theologian of the 16th century, published thirty-seven of his hymns in the Elucidatorium Ecclesiasticum (1516). The remaining seventy hymns were preserved in the Abbey of Saint Victor until its dissolution during the French Revolution. They were then transferred to the Biblioth√®que Nationale, where they were discovered by L√©on Gautier, who edited the first complete edition of them (Paris, 1858). Around 47 sequences by Adam survive. In a practice that developed from the ninth century onwards, these are poems composed to be sung during the mass, between the Alleluia and the gospel reading. The sequence therefore bridges the Old Testament or epistle readings and the gospel, both literarily and musically.

Other ideas presented here are entirely non-scientific, but have in one way or another impinged on scientific domains or practices. Many adherents or practitioners of the topics listed here dispute their characterization as pseudoscience. Each section here summarizes the alleged pseudoscientific aspects of that topic.  Physical sciences  = Astronomy and space sciences = * 2012 phenomenon ‚Äì a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end- date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chich√©n Itz√° in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala. Professional Mayanist scholars stated that no extant classic Maya accounts forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Maya history and culture, while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations. * Ancient astronauts ‚Äì a concept based on the belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistoric times. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures, technologies, and religions. A common claim is that deities from most, if not all, religions are actually extraterrestrial in origin, and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans. The idea that ancient astronauts existed is not taken seriously by academics, and has received no credible attention in peer reviewed studies.Harrold; \\"Noah's Ark and Ancient Astronauts: Pseudoscientific Beliefs About the Past Among a Sample of College Students;\\" The Skeptical Inquirer; vol 11.1; 1986: 61; Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal; 13 December 2010. :* Anunnaki from Nibiru (Sitchin) (variant) ‚Äì Zecharia Sitchin proposed in his series The Earth Chronicles, beginning with The 12th Planet (1976) revolves around Sitchin's unique interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts from around the world. He hypothesizes that the gods of old Mesopotamia were actually astronauts from the planet \\"Nibiru\\", which Sitchin claims the Sumerians believed to be a remote \\"12th planet\\" (counting the Sun, Moon, and Pluto as planets) associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit our sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. :* Ancient astronauts from the Sirius star-system (Temple) (variant) ‚Äì Robert K. G. Temple's proposal in his book The Sirius Mystery (1976) argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including supposed advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Sumer. * Astrology (see also Astrology and science) ‚Äì consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Several systems of divination are based on the relative positions and movement of various real and construed celestial bodies. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified. * Creationist cosmologies are explanations of the origins and form of the universe in terms of the Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1), according to which the God of the Bible created the cosmos in eight creative acts over the six days of the \\"creation week\\". * Dogon people and Sirius B ‚Äì a series of claims that the Dogon tribe knew about the white dwarf companion of Sirius despite it being invisible to the naked eye (and knew about it for reasons other than being told about it by visiting Europeans). * Evidence for life on Mars :* Martian canals ‚Äì Speculation about life on Mars exploded in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation by some observers of apparent artificially constructed canals‚Äîwhich were later found to be optical illusions. They were first described by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, and confirmed by later observers. :* The Face on Mars is a rock formation in Cydonia Mensae on Mars asserted to be evidence of intelligent, native life on the planet. High-resolution images taken recently show it to appear less face-like. It features prominently in the works of Richard C. Hoagland and Tom Van Flandern. This effect can also be explained by the psychological phenomena, pareidolia, whereby one assigns meaning (such as facial perception) to an otherwise ambiguous or meaningless stimuli. * Lunar effect ‚Äì the belief that the full Moon influences human behavior. * Modern flat Earth beliefs propose that the earth is a flat, disc-shaped planet that accelerates upward, producing the illusion of gravity. Proposers of a flat Earth, such as the Flat Earth Society, do not accept compelling evidence, such as photos of planet Earth from space. * Modern geocentrism ‚Äì In astronomy, the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system) is a superseded description of the universe with the Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all circled Earth. The geocentric model served as the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle and Ptolemy. * Moon landing conspiracy theories ‚Äì claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the six manned landings (1969‚Äì72) were faked and that 12 Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, Moon rock samples, and even killing some key witnesses. * Nibiru cataclysm ‚Äì a prediction first made by contactee Nancy Lieder that a mythological planet Nibiru would collide with Earth. After having adjusted her prediction many times, she later claimed the year of the occurrence to be 2012. In 2017, a conspiracy theorist known as David Meade claimed 2017 was the year Nibiru would hit. * VaimƒÅnika ShƒÅstra ‚Äì claim that airplanes were invented in ancient India during the Vedic period. A 1974 study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore found that the heavier-than-air aircraft that the VaimƒÅnika ShƒÅstra described were aerodynamically unfeasible. The authors remarked that the discussion of the principles of flight in the text were largely perfunctory and incorrect, in some cases violating Newton's laws of motion. * Worlds in Collision ‚Äì writer Immanuel Velikovsky proposed in his book Worlds in Collision that ancient texts and geographic evidence show mankind was witness to catastrophic interactions of other planets in our Solar system. = Earth sciences = * Megalithic geometry or 366 geometry ‚Äì posits the existence of an Earth-based geometry dating back to at least 3500 BCE, and the possibility that such a system is still in use in modern Freemasonry. According to proponents, megalithic civilizations in Britain and Brittany had advanced knowledge of geometry and the size of the Earth. The megalithic yard is correlated to the polar circumference of Earth using a circle divided into 366 degrees. * The Bermuda Triangle ‚Äì a region of the Atlantic Ocean that lies between Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and (in its most popular version) Florida. Ship and aircraft disasters and disappearances perceived as frequent in this area have led to the circulation of stories of unusual natural phenomena, paranormal encounters, and interactions with extraterrestrials. * Climate change denial ‚Äì involves denial, dismissal, unwarranted doubt or contrarian views which depart from the scientific consensus on climate change, including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its impacts on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions.: \\"The first pillar of climate change denial‚Äîthat climate change is bad science‚Äîattacks various aspects of the scientific consensus about climate change ‚Ä¶ there are climate change deniers: * who deny that significant climate change is occurring * who ‚Ä¶ deny that human activity is significantly responsible * who ‚Ä¶ deny the scientific evidence about its significant effects on the world and our society ‚Ä¶ * who ‚Ä¶ deny that humans can take significant actions to reduce or mitigate its impact. Of these varieties of climate change denial, the most visible are the first and the second.\\": \\"Anatomy of Denial‚ÄîGlobal warming deniers‚Ä¶. throw up a succession of claims, and fall back from one line of defense to the next as scientists refute each one in turn. Then they start over: 'The earth is not warming.' 'All right, it is warming but the Sun is the cause.' 'Well then, humans are the cause, but it doesn't matter, because it warming will do no harm. More carbon dioxide will actually be beneficial. More crops will grow.' 'Admittedly, global warming could turn out to be harmful, but we can do nothing about it.' 'Sure, we could do something about global warming, but the cost would be too great. We have more pressing problems here and now, like AIDS and poverty.' 'We might be able to afford to do something to address global warming some- day, but we need to wait for sound science, new technologies, and geoengineering.' 'The earth is not warming. Global warming ended in 1998; it was never a crisis.' * Flood geology ‚Äì creationist form of geology that advocates most of the geologic features on Earth are explainable by a global flood. * Hollow Earth ‚Äì a proposal that Earth is either entirely hollow or consists of hollow sections beneath the crust. Certain folklore and conspiracy theories hold this idea and suggest the existence of subterranean life. * Welteislehre, a.k.a. the World Ice Theory or Glacial Cosmogony ‚Äì ice is proposed to be the basic substance of all cosmic processes, and ice moons, ice planets, and the \\"global ether\\" (also made of ice) had determined the entire development of the universe. = Energy = * Animal magnetism - also known as mesmerism, was the name given by German doctor Franz Mesmer in the 18th century to what he believed to be an invisible natural force (Lebensmagnetismus) possessed by all living things, including humans, animals, and vegetables. He believed that the force could have physical effects, including healing, and he tried persistently but without success to achieve scientific recognition of his ideas.Wolfart, Karl Christian; Friedrich Anton Mesmer.

Cambridge University Press, 2011. . Foreword. * Free energy ‚Äì a class of perpetual motion that purports to create energy (violating the first law of thermodynamics) or extract useful work from equilibrium systems (violating the second law of thermodynamics). :* Water-fueled cars ‚Äì an instance of perpetual motion machines. Such devices are claimed to use water as fuel or produce fuel from water on board with no other energy input. Many such claims are part of investment frauds.State of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety press release, 9 November 2006 :* Gasoline pill, which was claimed to turn water into gasoline. :* Hongcheng Magic Liquid ‚Äì a scam in China where Wang Hongcheng (Chinese: ÁéãÊ¥™Êàê; pinyin: W√°ng H√≥ngch√©ng), a bus driver from Harbin with no scientific education, claimed in 1983 that he could turn regular water into a fuel as flammable as petrol by simply dissolving a few drops of his liquid in it. * Hydrinos ‚Äì a supposed state of the hydrogen atom that, according to its proponent, is of lower energy than ground state and has extremely high efficiency as a fuel. and Critics say it lacks corroborating scientific evidence, and is a relic of cold fusion. Critical analysis of the claims have been published in the peer reviewed journals Physics Letters A, New Journal of Physics, Journal of Applied Physics, and Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics on the basis that Quantum Mechanics is valid, and that the proposed hydrino states are unphysical and incompatible with key equations of Quantum Mechanics. * E-Cat ‚Äì a claimed cold fusion reactor.Patent application * Orgone ‚Äì a pseudoscientific concept described as an esoteric energy or hypothetical universal life force, originally proposed in the 1930s.Kenneth S. Isaacs (psychoanalyst), 1999: \\"Orgone‚Äîa useless fiction with faulty basic premises, thin partial theory, and unsubstantiated application results. It was quickly discredited and cast away.\\"Isaacs 1999, p. 240. = Physics = * Autodynamics ‚Äì a physics theory proposed in the 1940s that claims the equations of the Lorentz transformation are incorrectly formulated to describe relativistic effects, which would invalidate Einstein's theories of special relativity and general relativity, and Maxwell's equations. The theory is discounted by the mainstream physics community. * Einstein‚ÄìCartan‚ÄìEvans theory ‚Äì a unified theory of physics proposed by Myron Wyn Evans which claims to unify general relativity, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism.: \\"ECE Theory was discovered by chemist, physicist, and mathematician, Myron Wyn Evans...\\". The hypothesis was largely published in the journal Foundations of Physics Letters between 2003 and 2005; in 2008, the editor published an editorial note effectively retracting the journal's support for the hypothesis due to incorrect mathematical claims. * Electrogravitics ‚Äì claimed to be an unconventional type of effect or anti- gravity propulsion created by an electric field's effect on a mass. The name was coined in the 1920s by Thomas Townsend Brown, who first described the effect and spent most of his life trying to develop it and sell it as a propulsion system. Followups on the claims (R. L. Talley in a 1990 U.S. Air Force study, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell in a 2003 experiment, and Martin Tajmar in a 2004 paper) have found that no thrust could be observed in a vacuum, consistent with the phenomenon of ion wind.  Applied sciences  = Agriculture = * Lysenkoism, or Lysenko-Michurinism ‚Äì was a political campaign against genetics and science-based agriculture conducted by Trofim Lysenko, his followers and Soviet authorities. Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964. The pseudo- scientific ideas of Lysenkoism built on Lamarckian concepts of the heritability of acquired characteristics. Lysenko's theory rejected Mendelian inheritance and the concept of the \\"gene\\"; it departed from Darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection. * Biodynamic agriculture ‚Äì method of organic farming that treats farms as unified and individual organisms. Biodynamics uses a calendar which has been characterized as astrological. The substances and composts used by biodynamicists have been described as unconventional and homeopathic. For example, field mice are countered by deploying ashes prepared from field mice skin when Venus is in the Scorpius constellation. No difference in beneficial outcomes has been scientifically established between certified biodynamic agricultural techniques and similar organic and integrated farming practices. Biodynamic agriculture lacks strong scientific evidence for its efficacy and has been labeled a pseudoscience because of its overreliance upon esoteric knowledge and mystical beliefs. = Architecture = * Feng shui ‚Äì ancient Chinese system of mysticism and aesthetics based on astronomy, geography, and the putative flow of qi. Evidence for its effectiveness is based on anecdote, and there is a lack of a plausible method of action; this leads to conflicting advice from different practitioners of feng shui. Feng shui practitioners use this as evidence of variations or different schools; critical analysts have described it thus: \\"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork.\\" Modern criticism differentiates between feng shui as a traditional proto- religion and the modern practice: \\"A naturalistic belief, it was originally used to find an auspicious dwelling place for a shrine or a tomb. However, over the centuries it... has become distorted and degraded into a gross superstition.\\" * Ley lines ‚Äì proposed intentional alignment of ancient monuments and landscape features was later explained by a statistical analysis of lines that concluded: \\"the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip' a number of sites.\\" Additional New Age and feng shui concepts have been proposed building on the original concept, and pseudo-scientific claims about energy flowing through the lines have been made. * Vastu shastra is the ancient Hindu system of architecture, which lays down a series of rules for building houses in relation to ambiance. Vastu Shastra is considered as pseudoscience by rationalists like Narendra Nayak of Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations and astronomer Jayant Narlikar who writes that Vastu does not have any \\"logical connection\\" to the environment. = Finance = * Technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. It is still considered by many academics to be pseudoscience. Academics such as Eugene Fama say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the weak form of the efficient-market hypothesis. = Health and medicine = Pseudoscientific medical practices are often known as quackery. In contrast, modern medicine is (or seeks to be) evidence-based. * Acupuncture ‚Äì use of fine needles to stimulate acupuncture points and balance the flow of qi. There is no known anatomical or histological basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians and acupuncture is regarded as an alternative medical procedure. Some acupuncturists regard them as functional rather than structural entities, useful in guiding evaluation and care of patients. Acupuncture has been the subject of active scientific research since the late 20th century, and its effects and application remain controversial among medical researchers and clinicians. Because it is a procedure rather than a pill, the design of controlled studies is challenging, as with surgical and other procedures. Some scholarly reviews conclude that acupuncture's effects are mainly attributable to the placebo effect, and others find likelihood of efficacy for particular conditions. ** Dry needling is the therapeutic insertion of fine needles without regard to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) knowledge and is similarly controversial. ** Acupressure is an alternative medicine technique similar in principle to acupuncture. It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through \\"meridians\\" in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices. Some studies have suggested it may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, lower back pain, tension headaches, and stomach ache although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias. Like many alternative medicines, it may benefit from a placebo effect. Quackwatch says acupressure is a dubious practice and its practitioners use irrational methods. * Adrenal fatigue or hypoadrenia is a pseudoscientific diagnosis described as a state in which the adrenal glands are exhausted and unable to produce adequate quantities of hormones, primarily the glucocorticoid cortisol, due to chronic stress or infections. Quote: \\"There is no scientific basis for the existence of this disorder and no conclusive method for diagnosis.\\" Adrenal fatigue should not be confused with a number of actual forms of adrenal dysfunction such as adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease. The term \\"adrenal fatigue\\", which was invented in 1998 by James Wilson, a chiropractor, may be applied to a collection of mostly nonspecific symptoms. There is no scientific evidence supporting the concept of adrenal fatigue and it is not recognized as a diagnosis by any scientific or medical community. A systematic review found no evidence for the term adrenal fatigue, confirming the consensus among endocrinological societies that it is a myth. * The Alexander Technique, named after its creator Frederick Matthias Alexander, is an educational process that was created to retrain habitual patterns of movement and posture. Alexander believed that poor habits in posture and movement damaged spatial self-awareness as well as health, and that movement efficiency could support overall physical well-being. He saw the technique as a mental training technique as well. Alexander began developing his technique's principles in the 1890s in an attempt to address voice loss during public speaking. He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in Shakespearean theater. Some proponents of the Alexander Technique say that it addresses a variety of health conditions related to cumulative physical behaviors, but there is little evidence to support many of the claims made about the technique. As of 2015 there was evidence suggesting the Alexander Technique may be helpful for long-term back pain, long-term neck pain, and may help people cope with Parkinson's disease. However, both Aetna and the Australian Department of Health have conducted reviews and concluded that the technique has insufficient evidence to warrant insurance coverage. * Alternative cancer treatments are alternative or complementary treatments for cancer that have not been approved by the government agencies responsible for the regulation of therapeutic goods and have not undergone properly conducted, well-designed clinical trials. Among those that have been published, the methodology is often poor. A 2006 systematic review of 214 articles covering 198 clinical trials of alternative cancer treatments concluded that almost none conducted dose-ranging studies, which are necessary to ensure that the patients are being given a useful amount of the treatment. These kinds of treatments appear and vanish frequently, and have throughout history. * Alternative or fringe medicine ‚Äì The terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, and new age medicine are used interchangeably and are almost synonymous. Terminology shifts over time to reflect the branding of practitioners.\\"Integrative medicine\\": A brand, not a specialty. Science Based Medicine Therapies are often framed as \\"natural\\" or \\"holistic\\", implicitly and intentionally suggesting that conventional medicine is \\"artificial\\" and \\"narrow in scope\\". * Anthroposophic medicine, or anthroposophical medicine, is a form of alternative medicine. Cited in Devised in the 1920s by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman, it was based on occult notions and drew on Steiner's spiritual philosophy, which he called anthroposophy. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts. Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra-diluted substances, similar to those used in homeopathy. Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination, and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease. Professor of complementary medicine Edzard Ernst and other critics have characterized anthroposophic medicine as having no basis in science, pseudoscientific, and quackery. * Apitherapy is a branch of alternative medicine that uses honey bee products, including honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom. Proponents of apitherapy make claims for its health benefits which remain unsupported by evidence-based medicine. * Applied kinesiology (AK) is a technique in alternative medicine claimed to be able to diagnose illness or choose treatment by testing muscles for strength and weakness. According to their guidelines on allergy diagnostic testing, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology stated there is \\"no evidence of diagnostic validity\\" of applied kinesiology. Another study has shown that as an evaluative method, AK \\"is no more useful than random guessing\\", and the American Cancer Society has said that \\"scientific evidence does not support the claim that applied kinesiology can diagnose or treat cancer or other illness\\". * Aromatherapy uses aromatic materials, including essential oils, and other aroma compounds, with claims for improving psychological or physical well-being. It is offered as a complementary therapy or as a form of alternative medicine, the first meaning alongside standard treatments, the second instead of conventional, evidence-based treatments. Aromatherapists, people who specialize in the practice of aromatherapy, utilize blends of supposedly therapeutic essential oils that can be used as topical application, massage, inhalation or water immersion. There is no good medical evidence that aromatherapy can either prevent, treat, or cure any disease. Placebo-controlled trials are difficult to design, as the point of aromatherapy is the smell of the products. There is disputed evidence that it may be effective in combating postoperative nausea and vomiting. * Auriculotherapy (also auricular therapy, ear acupuncture, and auriculoacupuncture) is a form of alternative medicine based on the idea that the ear is a micro-system, which reflects the entire body, represented on the auricle, the outer portion of the ear. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively. Similar mappings are used in many areas of the body, including the practices of reflexology and iridology. These mappings are not based on or supported by any medical or scientific evidence, and are therefore considered to be pseudoscience. * Autistic enterocolitis ‚Äì is the name of a nonexistent medical condition proposed by discredited British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield when he suggested a link between a number of common clinical symptoms and signs which he contended were distinctive to autism. The existence of such an enterocolitis has been dismissed by experts as having \\"not been established\\". Wakefield's now-retracted and fraudulent report used inadequate controls and suppressed negative findings, and multiple attempts to replicate his results have been unsuccessful. Reviews in the medical literature have found no link between autism and bowel disease. * Balneotherapy ( \\"bath\\") is the presumed benefit from disease by bathing, a traditional medicine technique usually practiced at spas. Balneotherapy may involve hot or cold water, massage through moving water, relaxation, or stimulation. Many mineral waters at spas are rich in particular minerals such as silica, sulfur, selenium, and radium. Scientific studies into the effectiveness of balneotherapy do not show that balneotherapy is effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis. There is also no evidence indicating a more effective type of bath, or to indicate that bathing is more effective than exercise, relaxation therapy, or mudpacks. Most of the studies on balneotherapy have methodological flaws and are not reliable. A 2009 review of all published clinical evidence concluded that existing research is not sufficiently strong to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of balneotherapy. * Bates method for better eyesight ‚Äì an alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight. Eye-care physician William Horatio Bates, M.D. (1860‚Äì1931) attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of the eyes, and felt that glasses were harmful and never necessary. Bates self- published a book, Perfect Sight Without Glasses, as well as a magazine, Better Eyesight Magazine, (and earlier collaborated with Bernarr MacFadden on a correspondence course) detailing his approach to helping people relax such \\"strain\\", and thus, he claimed, improve their sight. His techniques centered on visualization and movement. In 1952, optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates, \\"Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists.\\" Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to \\"flashes of clear vision\\" experienced by many who followed it. Such occurrences have since been explained as a contact lens-like effect of moisture on the eye, or a flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles. * Biological terrain assessment ‚Äì a set of computerized tests used to measure the pH, resistivity, and redox of a person's urine, blood, and saliva, with the intention of recommending a customized program of health supplements and remedies (such as vitamins, homeopathic supplements, or herbal medicines) based on the results. Proponents suggest that BTA allows for a correction of biological imbalances before they become pathological, while opponents claim that the tests are imprecise and results in incorrect diagnoses. * Biorhythm theory - is an attempt to predict various aspects of a person's life through simple mathematical cycles. The theory was developed by Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in the late 1970s. It was described as pseudoscience. * Body memory (BM) is a hypothesis that the body itself is capable of storing memories, as opposed to only the brain. While experiments have demonstrated the possibility of cellular memory there are currently no known means by which tissues other than the brain would be capable of storing memories. Modern usage of BM tends to frame it exclusively in the context of traumatic memory and ways in which the body responds to recall of a memory. In this regard, it has become relevant in treatment for PTSD. * Brain Gym ‚Äì is an organization promoting a series of exercises claimed to improve academic performance. Twenty-six Brain Gym activities are claimed to improve eye teaming (binocular vision), spatial and listening skills, hand‚Äìeye coordination, and whole-body flexibility, and by doing this manipulate the brain, improving learning and recall of information. The Brain Gym program calls for children to repeat certain simple movements such as crawling, yawning, making symbols in the air, and drinking water; these are intended to \\"integrate\\", \\"repattern\\", and increase blood flow to the brain. Though the organization claims the methods are grounded in good neuroscience, the underlying ideas are pseudoscience. * Candida hypersensitivity ‚Äì It has been spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and non-specific symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, asthma, and others. The notion has been strongly challenged by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. * Chelation therapy is claimed by some practitioners of alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments, including heart disease and autism. The use of chelation therapy by alternative medicine practitioners for behavioral and other disorders is considered pseudoscientific; there is no proof that it is effective. In addition to being ineffective, chelation therapy prior to heavy metal testing can artificially raise urinary heavy metal concentrations (\\"provoked\\" urine testing) and lead to inappropriate and unnecessary treatment. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology warn the public that chelating drugs used in chelation therapy may have serious side effects, including liver and kidney damage, blood pressure changes, allergies and in some cases even death of the patient. * Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine mostly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. Some proponents, especially those in the field's early history, have claimed that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system, through vertebral subluxation, claims which are not based on scientific evidence. The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy, especially spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), manipulations of other joints and soft tissues. AHCPR Pub No. 98-N002. Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine, and chiropractic is sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as vertebral subluxation and \\"innate intelligence\\" that reject science. * Chromotherapy, sometimes called color therapy, colorology or cromatherapy, is an alternative medicine method, which is considered pseudoscience.Williams, William F. (2000). Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy. Facts on File Inc. p. 52. Chromotherapists claim to be able to use light in the form of color to balance \\"energy\\" lacking from a person's body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels. Color therapy is distinct from other types of light therapy, such as neonatal jaundice treatment and blood irradiation therapy which is a scientifically accepted medical treatment for a number of conditions, and from photobiology, the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms. French skeptic and lighting physicist S√©bastien Point considers that LED lamps at domestic radiance are safe in normal use for the general population; he also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control.S.Point, the danger of chromotherapy, Skeptical Inquirer, Vol.41, N¬∞4, July/August 2017 skepdigest.awardspace.us/The_Danger_of_Chromotherapy.pdf * Chronic Lyme disease (not to be confused with Lyme disease) is a generally rejected diagnosis that encompasses \\"a broad array of illnesses or symptom complexes for which there is no reproducible or convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to Borrelia burgdorferi infection.\\" Despite numerous studies, there is no clinical evidence that \\"chronic\\" Lyme disease is caused by a persistent infection. It is distinct from post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, a set of lingering symptoms which may persist after successful treatment of infection with Lyme spirochetes. The symptoms of \\"chronic Lyme\\" are generic and non-specific \\"symptoms of life\\". * Colon cleansing (a.k.a. colon therapy) encompasses a number of alternative medical therapies claimed to remove nonspecific toxins from the colon and intestinal tract by removing any accumulations of feces. Colon cleansing may be branded colon hydrotherapy, a colonic or colonic irrigation. During the 2000s, internet marketing and infomercials of oral supplements supposedly for colon cleansing increased. Some forms of colon Hydrotherapy use tubes to inject water, sometimes mixed with herbs or with other liquids, into the colon via the rectum using special equipment. Oral cleaning regimens use dietary fiber, herbs, dietary supplements, or laxatives. People who practice colon cleansing believe that accumulations of putrefied feces line the walls of the large intestine and that these accumulations harbor parasites or pathogenic gut flora, causing nonspecific symptoms and general ill-health. This \\"auto-intoxication\\" hypothesis is based on medical beliefs of the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks and was discredited in the early 20th century. * Colloidal silver (a colloid consisting of silver particles suspended in liquid) and formulations containing silver salts were used by physicians in the early 20th century, but their use was largely discontinued in the 1940s following the development of safer and effective modern antibiotics. Since about 1990, there has been a resurgence of the promotion of colloidal silver as a dietary supplement, marketed with claims of it being an essential mineral supplement, or that it can prevent or treat numerous diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, HIV/AIDS, herpes, and tuberculosis. No medical evidence supports the effectiveness of colloidal silver for any of these claimed indications. Silver is not an essential mineral in humans; there is no dietary requirement for silver, and hence, no such thing as a silver \\"deficiency\\". There is no evidence that colloidal silver treats or prevents any medical condition, and it can cause serious and potentially irreversible side effects such as argyria. * Craniosacral therapy ‚Äì is a form of bodywork or alternative therapy using gentle touch to manipulate the synarthrodial joints of the cranium. A practitioner of cranial-sacral therapy may also apply light touches to a patient's spine and pelvis. Practitioners believe that this manipulation regulates the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and aids in \\"primary respiration.\\" Craniosacral therapy was developed by John Upledger, D.O. in the 1970s, as an offshoot of osteopathy in the cranial field, or cranial osteopathy, which was developed in the 1930s by William Garner Sutherland. According to the American Cancer Society, although CST may relieve the symptoms of stress or tension, \\"available scientific evidence does not support claims that craniosacral therapy helps in treating cancer or any other disease.\\" CST has been characterized as pseudoscience and its practice has been called quackery. Cranial osteopathy has received a similar assessment, with one 1990 paper finding there was no scientific basis for any of the practitioners' claims the paper examined. * Cryonics ‚Äì a field of products, techniques, and beliefs supporting the idea that freezing the clinically dead, at very low temperatures (typically below ‚àí196 degrees Celsius) will enable future revival or re-substantiation. These beliefs often hinge on the existence of advanced human or alien societies, in the distant future, who will possess as-of-yet unknown technology for the stabilization of dying cells. There is no evidence a human being can be revived after such freezing, and no solid scientific evidence suggests that reanimation will be possible in the future. * Crystal healing ‚Äì belief that crystals have healing properties. Once common among pre- scientific and indigenous peoples, it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s with the New Age movement. There is no scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect.Regal, Brian. (2009). Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia. Greenwood. p. 51. * Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine. Cupping is used in more than 60 countries. Its usage dates back to as far as 1550 B.C. There are different forms of cupping; the most common are dry, wet, and fire cupping. Cups are applied onto the skin and a suction is created, pulling the skin up. It is meant to increase blood flow to certain areas to the body. Not a part of medical practice in the modern era, cupping has been characterized as a pseudoscience. There is no good evidence it has any health benefits, and there are some risks of harm, especially in case of wet and fire cupping. * Detoxification ‚Äì Detoxification in the context of alternative medicine consists of an approach that claims to rid the body of \\"toxins\\" ‚Äì accumulated substances that allegedly exert undesirable effects on individual health in the short or long term. The concept has received criticism from scientists and health organizations for its unsound scientific basis and lack of evidence for the claims made. The \\"toxins\\" usually remain undefined, with little to no evidence of toxic accumulation in the patient. The British organisation Sense About Science has described some detox diets and commercial products as \\"a waste of time and money\\", while the British Dietetic Association called the idea \\"nonsense\\" and a \\"marketing myth\\". * Ear candling also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is a pseudoscientifican alternative medicine practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the other end in the ear canal. Medical research has shown that the practice is both dangerous and ineffective and does not functionally remove earwax or toxicants, despite product design contributing to that impression. * Earthing therapy or Grounding is a therapy that is claimed to ease pain, provide a better night's sleep, and assist in diseases with symptoms of inflammation by being in direct physical contact with the ground or a device connected to electrical ground. Purportedly, Earth has an excess of electrons which people are missing due to insulating shoes and ground cover. Being in electrical contact with Earth provides the body with those excess electrons, which then act as antioxidants. A 2012 systematic review study showed inconclusive results related to methodological issues across the literature. Subsequently, a 2017 systematic review of the benefits of spending time in forests demonstrated positive health effects, but not enough to generate clinical practice guidelines or demonstrate causality. * Electrohomeopathy (or Mattei cancer cure) is a derivative of homeopathy invented in the 19th century by Count Cesare Mattei. The name is derived from a combination of electro (referring to an electric bio-energy content supposedly extracted from plants and of therapeutic value, rather than electricity in its conventional sense) and homeopathy (referring to an alternative medicinal philosophy developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century). Electrohomeopathy has been defined as the combination of electrical devices and homeopathy. * Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) ‚Äì reported sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields or electromagnetic radiation of various frequencies at exposure levels well below established safety standards. Symptoms are inconsistent, but can include headache, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and similar non-specific indications. Provocation studies find that the discomfort of sufferers is unrelated to hidden sources of radiation, and \\"no scientific basis currently exists for a connection between EHS and exposure to [electromagnetic fields].\\" * Energy medicine, energy therapy, energy healing, vibrational medicine, psychic healing, spiritual medicine or spiritual healing are branches of alternative medicine based on a pseudo-scientific belief that healers can channel healing energy into a patient and effect positive results. This idea itself contains several methods: hands-on, hands-off, and distant (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations. While early reviews of the scientific literature on energy healing were equivocal and recommended further research, more recent reviews have concluded that there is no evidence supporting clinical efficiency. * Facilitated communication is a scientifically discredited technique that attempts to aid communication by people with autism or other communication disabilities. The facilitator holds the disabled person's arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move to type on a keyboard or other device. Research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through FC (involving ideomotor effect guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator). Studies have consistently found that FC is unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object). In addition, in numerous cases disabled persons have been assumed by facilitators to be typing a coherent message while the patient's eyes were closed or while they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board. * Faith healing ‚Äì act of curing disease by such means as prayer and laying on of hands. There is no material benefit in excess of that expected by the placebo effect is observed. \\"Belief in pseudoscience is relatively widespread... Polls also show that one quarter to more than half of the public believes in ... faith healing.\\" * Fasting ‚Äì Some practitioners of alternative medicine promote \\"cleansing the body\\" through fasting; the concept is quackery with no scientific basis for its rationale or efficacy. During the early 20th century, fasting was promoted by alternative health writers such as Hereward Carrington, Edward H. Dewey, Bernarr Macfadden, Frank McCoy, Edward Earle Purinton, Upton Sinclair and Wallace Wattles. All of these writers were either involved in the natural hygiene or new thought movement. In 1911, Sinclair authored The Fasting Cure, which made sensational claims of fasting curing practically all diseases, including cancer, syphilis and tuberculosis.Nash, Jay R. (1982). Zanies: The World's Greatest Eccentrics. New Century Publishers. p. 339. Gratzer, Walter. (2005). Terrors of the Table: The Curious History of Nutrition. Oxford University Press. p. 201. Sinclair has been described as \\"the most credulous of faddists\\" and his book is considered an example of quackery.Kang, Lydia; Pedersen, Nate. (2017). Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything. Workman Publishing. p. 265. * Functional medicine is a form of alternative medicine that encompasses a number of unproven and disproven methods and treatments. Its proponents claim that it focuses on the \\"root causes\\" of diseases based on interactions between the environment and the gastrointestinal, endocrine, and immune systems to develop \\"individualized treatment plans\\". Opponents have described it as pseudoscience, quackery, and at its essence a re-branding of complementary and alternative medicine. * Germanic New Medicine ‚Äì On 8 August 1978, Ryke Geerd Hamer's son, Dirk, was shot by the son of the last king of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, while asleep on a yacht off Cavallo and died on 7 December 1978. Sometime after Dirk's death, Hamer began to develop Germanic New Medicine (GNM). According to GNM no real diseases exist; rather, what established medicine calls a \\"disease\\" is actually a \\"special meaningful program of nature\\" (sinnvolles biologisches Sonderprogramm) to which bacteria, viruses and fungi belong. Hamer's GNM claims to explain every disease and treatment according to those premises, and to thereby obviate traditional medicine. The cure is always the resolving of the conflict. Some treatments like chemotherapy or pain relieving drugs like morphine are deadly, according to Hamer. These \\"laws\\" are dogmas of GNM, not laws of nature or medicine, and are at odds with scientific understanding of human physiology.Another cancer tragedy in the making, David Gorski, Science Based Medicine * Hair analysis is, in mainstream scientific usage, the chemical analysis of a hair sample. The use of hair analysis in alternative medicine as a method of investigation to assist alternative diagnosis is controversial and its use in this manner has been opposed repeatedly by the AMA because of its unproven status and its potential for health care fraud.Hair analysis: A potential for medical abuse. Policy number H-175.995,(Sub. Res. 67, I-84; Reaffirmed by CLRPD Rep. 3 ‚Äì I-94) * Health bracelets and various healing jewelry that are purported to improve the health, heal, or improve the chi of the wearer, such as ionized bracelets, hologram bracelets, and magnetic jewelry. No claims of effectiveness made by manufacturers have ever been substantiated by independent sources. * Hexagonal water ‚Äì A term used in a marketing scam that claims the ability to create a certain configuration of water that is better for the body. The term \\"hexagonal water\\" refers to a cluster of water molecules forming a hexagonal shape that supposedly enhances nutrient absorption, removes metabolic wastes, and enhances cellular communication, among other things. Similar to the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, the scam takes advantage of the consumer's limited knowledge of chemistry, physics, and physiology. * Homeopathy ‚Äì the belief that a patient with symptoms of an illness can be treated with extremely dilute remedies that are thought to produce those same symptoms in healthy people. These preparations are often diluted beyond the point where any treatment molecule is likely to remain. Studies of homeopathic practice have been largely negative or inconclusive. No scientific basis for homeopathic principles has been substantiated. :*Bach flower remedies (BFRs) are solutions of brandy and water‚Äîthe water containing extreme dilutions of flower material developed by Edward Bach, an English homeopath, in the 1930s. Bach claimed that dew found on flower petals retain imagined healing properties of that plant. Systematic reviews of clinical trials of Bach flower solutions have found no efficacy beyond a placebo effect. * Iridology ‚Äì means of medical diagnosis which proponents believe can identify and diagnose health problems through close examination of the markings and patterns of the iris. Practitioners divide the iris into 80‚Äì90 zones, each of which is connected to a particular body region or organ. This connection has not been scientifically validated, and disorder detection is neither selective nor specific. Because iris texture is a phenotypical feature which develops during gestation and remains unchanged after birth (which makes the iris useful for Biometrics), iridology is all but impossible. * Leaky gut syndrome ‚Äì in alternative medicine, a proposed condition caused by the passage of harmful substances outward through the gut wall. It has been proposed as the cause of many conditions, including multiple sclerosis and autism, a claim which has been called pseudoscientific. According to the UK National Health Service, the theory is vague and unproven. Some skeptics and scientists say that the marketing of treatments for leaky gut syndrome is either misguided or an instance of deliberate health fraud. * Lightning Process ‚Äì a system claimed to be derived from osteopathy, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) and life coaching. Proponents claim that the Process can have a positive effect on a long list of diseases and conditions, including myalgic encephalomyelitis, despite no scientific evidence of efficacy. The designer of the Lightning Process, Phil Parker, suggests certain illnesses such as ME/CFS arise from a dysregulation of the central nervous system and autonomic nervous system, which the Lightning Process aims to address, helping to break the \\"adrenaline loop\\" that keeps the systems' stress responses high. * Macrobiotic diets (or macrobiotics) are fixed on ideas about types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism. The diet attempts to balance the supposed yin and yang elements of food and cookware. Major principles of macrobiotic diets are to reduce animal products, eat locally grown foods that are in season, and consume meals in moderation. Macrobiotics writers often claim that a macrobiotic diet is helpful for people with cancer and other chronic diseases, although there is no good evidence to support such recommendations, and that the diet can be harmful. Studies that indicate positive results are of poor methodological quality. Neither the American Cancer Society nor Cancer Research UK recommend adopting the diet. * Magnet therapy ‚Äì practice of using magnetic fields to positively influence health. While there are legitimate medical uses for magnets and magnetic fields, the field strength used in magnetic therapy is too low to effect any biological change, and the methods used have no scientific validity. :* The above is not to be confused with current health treatments involving electromagnetism on human tissue, such as pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (see: Electromagnetic therapy). * Ayurveda ‚Äì traditional Ayurveda is a 5,000-year-old alternative medical practice with roots in ancient India based on a mind-body set of beliefs. Imbalance or stress in an individual's consciousness is believed to be the cause of diseases. Patients are classified by body types (three doshas, which are considered to control mind-body harmony, determine an individual's \\"body type\\"); and treatment is aimed at restoring balance to the mind-body system. It has long been the main traditional system of health care in India, and it has become institutionalized in India's colleges and schools, although unlicensed practitioners are common. As with other traditional knowledge, much of it was lost; in the West, current practice is in part based on the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1980s, who mixed it with Transcendental Meditation; other forms of Ayurveda exist as well. The most notable advocate of Ayurveda in America is Deepak Chopra, who claims that the Maharishi's Ayurveda is based on quantum mysticism. * A medical intuitive is an alternative medicine practitioner who claims to use their self-described intuitive abilities to find the cause of a physical or emotional condition through the use of insight rather than modern medicine. Other terms for such a person include medical clairvoyant, medical psychic or intuitive counselor. In 2009 Steven Novella, writing on Science Based Medicine, calls medical intuitive diagnosis as \\"purely magical thinking\\" and refers to a Huffington Post article about it as \\"a promotion of a dubious pseudoscientific medical claim\\". * Morgellons ‚Äì is the informal name of a self-diagnosed, unexplained skin condition in which individuals have sores that they believe contain some kind of fibers. Morgellons is poorly characterized but the general medical consensus is that it is a form of delusional parasitosis. An attempt to link Morgellons to the cause of Lyme disease has been attacked by Steven Salzberg as \\"dangerous pseudoscience\\". * Moxibustion ‚Äì application on or above the skin of smoldering mugwort, or moxa, to stimulate acupuncture points. A Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the use of moxibustion in correcting breech presentation of babies and called for more experimental trials. Side effects included nausea, throat irritation, and abdominal pain from contractions. Moxibustion has also been studied for the treatment of pain, cancer, stroke, ulcerative colitis, constipation, and hypertension. Systematic reviews have found that these studies are of low quality and positive findings could be due to publication bias. * Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques (NAET) are a form of alternative medicine which proponents claim can treat allergies and related disorders. The techniques were devised by Devi Nambudripad, a California-based chiropractor and acupuncturist, in 1983, drawing on a combination of ideas from applied kinesiology, acupuncture, acupressure, nutritional management and chiropractic methods. There is no credible evidence to support its effectiveness in assessing or treating allergies. * Naturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, is a type of alternative medicine based on a belief in vitalism, which posits that a special energy called vital energy or vital force guides bodily processes such as metabolism, reproduction, growth, and adaptation.Sarris, J., and Wardle, J. 2010. Clinical naturopathy: an evidence-based guide to practice. Elsevier Australia. Chatswood, NSW. Naturopathy has been characterized as pseudoscience. It has particularly been criticized for its unproven, disproven, or dangerous treatments., a web page with further references Natural methods and chemicals are not necessarily safer or more effective than artificial or synthetic ones; any treatment capable of eliciting an effect may also have deleterious side effects. * Negative air ionization therapy is the use of air ionizers as an experimental non-pharmaceutical treatment. It is widely considered pseudoscience. * Oil pulling ‚Äì is a folk remedy where oil is \\"swished\\" or \\"held\\" in the mouth for up to 20 minutes with the goal of improving oral as well as systemic health. It is said that this technique \\"pulls out\\" toxins from the body, and is claimed to be able to treat a plethora of conditions from migraines to diabetes. * Orthomolecular medicine, sometimes referred to as megavitamin therapy, is a form of alternative medicine, that aims to maintain human health through nutritional supplementation. The concept builds on the idea of an optimum nutritional environment in the body and suggests that diseases reflect deficiencies in this environment. Treatment for disease, according to this view, involves attempts to correct \\"imbalances or deficiencies based on individual biochemistry\\" by use of substances such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, trace elements and fatty acids. The notions behind orthomolecular medicine are not supported by sound medical evidence and the therapy is not effective; even the validity of calling the orthomolecular approach a form of medicine has been questioned since the 1970s. * Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) or osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) ‚Äì the core technique of osteopathic medicine. OMM is based on a philosophy devised by Andrew Taylor Still (1828‚Äì1917), who held that the body had self-regulating mechanisms that could be harnessed through manipulating the bones, tendons and muscles. It has been proposed as a treatment for a number of human ailments including Parkinson's disease, pancreatitis, and pneumonia, but has only been found to be effective for lower back pain by virtue of the spinal manipulation used. It has long been regarded as rooted in \\"pseudoscientific dogma\\". In 2010, Steven Salzberg referred to the OMT-specific training given by colleges of osteopathic medicine as \\"training in pseudoscientific practices\\". * Pulse diagnosis is a diagnostic technique used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Mongolian medicine, Siddha medicine, traditional Tibetan medicine, and Unani. It has no scientific legitimacy, and is ill-defined, subjective and unreliable. * Radionics ‚Äì means of medical diagnosis and therapy which proponents believe can diagnose and remedy health problems using various frequencies in a putative energy field coupled to the practitioner's electronic device. The first such \\"black box\\" devices were designed and promoted by Albert Abrams, and were definitively proven useless by an independent investigation commissioned by Scientific American in 1924. The internal circuitry of radionics devices is often obfuscated and irrelevant, leading proponents to conjecture dowsing and ESP as operating principles. Similar devices continue to be marketed under various names, though none is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration; there is no scientific evidence for the efficacy or underlying premise of radionics devices. The radionics of Albert Abrams and his intellectual descendants should not be confused with similarly named reputable and legitimate companies, products, or medical treatments such as radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation. * Reiki is a form of alternative medicine called energy healing. Reiki practitioners use a technique called palm healing or hands-on healing through which a \\"universal energy\\" is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing. Reiki is a pseudoscience, and is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles. It is based on qi (\\"chi\\"), which practitioners say is a universal life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists.Reiki: Fraudulent Misrepresentation ¬´ Science-Based Medicine: Reiki: Fraudulent Misrepresentation ¬´ Science-Based Medicine, accessdate: 28 May 2016 Clinical research has not shown reiki to be effective as a treatment for any medical condition. There has been no proof of the effectiveness of reiki therapy compared to the placebo effect. An overview of reiki investigations found that studies reporting positive effects had methodological flaws. The American Cancer Society stated that reiki should not replace conventional cancer treatment, a sentiment echoed by Cancer Research UK and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Developed in Japan in 1922 by Mikao Usui, it has been adapted into varying cultural traditions across the world. * Reflexology, or zone therapy, is an alternative medicine involving the physical act of applying pressure to the feet, hands, or ears with specific thumb, finger, and hand techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based on what reflexologists claim to be a system of zones and reflex areas that they say reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work effects a physical change to the body. A 2009 systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that the best evidence available to date does not demonstrate convincingly that reflexology is an effective treatment for any medical condition. There is no consensus among reflexologists on how reflexology is supposed to work; a unifying theme is the idea that areas on the foot correspond to areas of the body and that, by manipulating these, one can improve health through one's qi. Reflexologists divide the body into ten equal vertical zones, five on the right and five on the left. Concerns have been raised by medical professionals that treating potentially serious illnesses with reflexology, which has no proven efficacy, could delay the seeking of appropriate medical treatment. * Rolfing (also called Structural Integration) ‚Äì body manipulation devised by Ida Rolf (1896‚Äì1979) claimed by practitioners to be capable of ridding the body of traumatic memories storied in the muscles. There is no evidence that rolfing is effective as a treatment for any condition. * Therapeutic touch ‚Äì a form of vitalism where a practitioner, who may be also a nurse, passes his or her hands over and around a patient to \\"realign\\" or \\"rebalance\\" a putative energy field. A recent Cochrane Review concluded that \\"[t]here is no evidence that [Therapeutic Touch] promotes healing of acute wounds.\\" No biophysical basis for such an energy field has been found. * Tin foil hat ‚Äì A tin foil hat is a hat made from one or more sheets of aluminium foil, or a piece of conventional headgear lined with foil, worn in the belief it shields the brain from threats such as electromagnetic fields, mind control, and mind reading. The usage of a metal foil hat for protection against interference of the mind was mentioned in a science fiction short story by Julian Huxley, \\"The Tissue-Culture King\\", first published in 1926, in which the protagonist discovers that \\"caps of metal foil\\" can block the effects of telepathy. At this time no link has been established between the radio-frequency EMR that tin foil hats are meant to protect against and subsequent ill health. * Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) ‚Äì a traditional medical system originating in China and practiced as an alternative medicine throughout much of the world. It contains elements based in the cosmology of Taoism, and considers the human body more in functional and vitalistic than anatomical terms. Health and illness in TCM follow the principle of yin and yang, and are ascribed to balance or imbalance in the flow of a vital force, qi. Diagnostic methods are solely external, including pulse examination at six points, examination of a patient's tongue, and a patient interview; interpractitioner diagnostic agreement is poor. The TCM description of the function and structure of the human body is fundamentally different from modern medicine. ** TCM materia medica ‚Äì a collection of crude medicines used in traditional Chinese medicine. These include many plants in part or whole, such as ginseng and wolfberry, as well as more exotic ingredients such as seahorses. Preparations generally include several ingredients in combination, with selection based on physical characteristics such as taste or shape, or relationship to the organs of TCM. Most preparations have not been rigorously evaluated or give no indication of efficacy. Pharmacognosy research for potential active ingredients present in these preparations is active, though the applications do not always correspond to those of TCM. ** Gua sha (), kerokan or coining, is part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Its practitioners use a tool to scrape people's skin to cause tissue damage in the belief this has medicinal benefit. Gua sha is sometimes referred to as \\"scraping\\", \\"spooning\\" or \\"coining\\" by English speakers. Any apparent benefit from gua sha is due to the placebo effect. ** Meridians are the channels through which qi flows, connecting the several zang-fu organ pairs. There is no known anatomical or histological basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians. ** Shiatsu () is a form of Japanese bodywork based on ideas in traditional Chinese medicine. Shiatsu derives from a Japanese massage modality called anma. There is no evidence that shiatsu is an effective medical treatment.> ** Qi ‚Äì vital energy whose flow must be balanced for health. Qi has never been directly observed, and is unrelated to the concept of energy used in science. \\"Despite complete scientific rejection, the concept of a special biological fields within living things remains deeply engraved in human thinking. It is now working its way into modern health care systems, as non-scientific alternative therapies become increasingly popular. From acupuncture to homeopathy and therapeutic touch, the claim is made that healing can be brought about by the proper adjustment of a person's or animal's 'bioenergetic fields. ** Qigong (),\\"qigong\\". Collins English Dictionary. qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung () is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (chi), translated as \\"life energy\\". Research concerning qigong has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including hypertension, pain, and cancer, and with respect to quality of life. Most research concerning health benefits of qigong has been of poor quality, such that it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage. ** Zang-fu ‚Äì concept of organs as functional yin and yang entities for the storage and manipulation of qi. These organs are not based in anatomy. * Urine therapy ‚Äì drinking either one's own undiluted urine or homeopathic potions of urine for treatment of a wide variety of diseases is based on pseudoscience. * Promotion of a link between autism and vaccines, in which the vaccines are accused of causing autism-spectrum conditions, triggering them, or aggravating them, has been characterized as pseudoscience. Many epidemiological studies have reported no association between either the MMR vaccine and autism, or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Consequently, the Institute of Medicine has concluded that there is no causal link between either of these varieties of vaccines and autism. Similarly, \\"Vaccine overload\\", a non-medical term describing the notion that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immature immune system and lead to adverse effects, is strongly contradicted by scientific evidence. * Vitalism ‚Äì doctrine that the processes of life are not explicable by the laws of physics and chemistry alone and that life is in some part self-determining. The book Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience stated \\"today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force.\\" \\"Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality.\\" * Wilson's syndrome (not to be confused with Wilson's disease) is an alternative medicine concept, not recognized as a legitimate diagnosis in evidence-based medicine. Its supporters describe Wilson's syndrome as a mix of common and non-specific symptoms which they attribute to low body temperature and impaired conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), despite normal thyroid function tests. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) says Wilson's syndrome is at odds with established knowledge of thyroid function, has vague diagnostic criteria, and lacks supporting scientific evidence. The ATA further raised concern that the proposed treatments were potentially harmful. * Wind turbine syndrome and wind farm syndrome are terms for adverse health effects that have been ascribed to the proximity of wind turbines. Proponents have claimed that these effects include death, cancer and congenital abnormality. The distribution of recorded events, however, correlates with media coverage of wind farm syndrome itself, and not with the presence or absence of wind farms. Reviews of the scientific literature have consistently found no reason to believe that wind turbines are harmful to health.  Social sciences  = History= * New chronology (Fomenko) - pseudohistorical conspiracy theory which argues that events of antiquity generally attributed to the civilizations of the Roman Empire, Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt, actually occurred during the Middle Ages, more than a thousand years later. = Psychology = * Attachment therapy ‚Äì common name for a set of potentially fatal clinical interventions and parenting techniques aimed at controlling aggressive, disobedient, or unaffectionate children using \\"restraint and physical and psychological abuse to seek their desired results.\\" (the term \\"attachment therapy\\" may sometimes be used loosely to refer to mainstream approaches based on attachment theory, usually outside the US where the pseudoscientific form of attachment therapy is less known). Probably the most common form is holding therapy, in which the child is restrained by adults for the purpose of supposed cathartic release of suppressed rage and regression. Perhaps the most extreme, but much less common, is \\"rebirthing\\", in which the child is wrapped tightly in a blanket and then made to simulate emergence from a birth canal. This is done by encouraging the child to struggle and pushing and squeezing him/her to mimic contractions. Despite the practice's name, it is not based on traditional attachment theory and shares no principles of mainstream developmental psychology research. In 2006, it was the subject of an almost entirely critical Taskforce Report commissioned by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC). Not all forms of attachment therapy are coercive and since the Candace Newmaker case, there has been a move towards less coercive practices by leaders in the field. * Conversion therapy ‚Äì sometimes called reparative therapy, seeks to change a non-heterosexual person's sexual orientation so they will no longer be homosexual or bisexual. The American Psychiatric Association defines reparative therapy as \\"psychiatric treatment ... which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change their sexual homosexual orientation.\\" * Coding is a catch-all term for various Russian alternative therapeutic methods used to treat addictions, in which the therapist attempts to scare patients into abstinence from a substance they are addicted to by convincing them that they will be harmed or killed if they use it again. Each method involves the therapist pretending to insert a \\"code\\" into patients' brains that will ostensibly provoke a strong adverse reaction should it come into contact with the addictive substance. The methods use a combination of theatrics, hypnosis, placebos, and drugs with temporary adverse effects to instill the erroneous beliefs. Therapists may pretend to \\"code\\" patients for a fixed length of time, such as five years. * Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy in which the person being treated is asked to recall distressing images; the therapist then directs the person in one type of bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side eye movements or hand tapping. It is included in several guidelines for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some clinical psychologists have argued that the eye movements do not add anything above imagery exposure and characterize its promotion and use as pseudoscience. However, this characterization is disputed in light of two large meta analyses show the effect size was larger when eye movements were used. * Facilitated communication (FC), supported typing, or hand over hand, is a scientifically discredited technique that attempts to facilitate communication by people with severe educational and communication disabilities. The facilitator holds or gently touches the disabled person's arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move to type on a special keyboard. In addition to providing physical support needed for typing or pointing, the facilitator provides verbal prompts and moral support. There is widespread agreement within the scientific community and multiple disability advocacy organizations that FC is not a valid technique for authentically augmenting the communication skills of those with autism spectrum disorder. Instead, research indicates that the facilitator is the source of most or all messages obtained through FC (involving ideomotor effect guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator); thus, studies have consistently found that patients are unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object) . In addition, numerous cases have been reported by investigators in which disabled persons were assumed by facilitators to be typing a coherent message while the patient's eyes were closed or while they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board. * The Feldenkrais Method is a type of exercise therapy devised by Israeli Mosh√© Feldenkrais (1904‚Äì1984) during the mid-20th century. The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state. There is no good medical evidence that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits. It is not known if it is safe or cost-effective, but researchers do not believe it poses serious risks. * Graphology ‚Äì psychological test based on a belief that personality traits unconsciously and consistently influence handwriting morphology‚Äîthat certain types of people exhibit certain quirks of the pen. Analysis of handwriting attributes provides no better than chance correspondence with personality, and neuroscientist Barry Beyerstein likened the assigned correlations to sympathetic magic. Graphology is only superficially related to forensic document examination, which also examines handwriting. * Hypnosis ‚Äì state of extreme relaxation and inner focus in which a person is unusually responsive to suggestions made by the hypnotist. The modern practice has its roots in the idea of animal magnetism, or mesmerism, originated by Franz Mesmer. Mesmer's explanations were thoroughly discredited, and to this day there is no agreement amongst researchers whether hypnosis is a real phenomenon, or merely a form of participatory role-enactment.Westen et al. 2006 \\"Psychology: Australian and New Zealand edition\\" John Wiley. Some aspects of suggestion have been clinically useful.Nash, Michael R. \\"The Truth and the Hype of Hypnosis\\". Scientific American: July 2001 Other claimed uses of hypnosis more clearly fall within the area of pseudoscience. Such areas include the use of hypnotic regression, including past life regression. \\"[H]ypnotically induced past life experiences are rule-governed, goal-directed fantasies that are context generated and sensitive to the demands of the hypnotic regression situation.\\" * Hypnotherapy ‚Äì therapy that is undertaken with a subject in hypnosis. It is widely considered a branch of alternative medicine though its founder, James Braid, has been described as \\"one of the most ardent and influential critics of pseudo-science.\\" :Using hypnosis for relaxation, mood control, and other related benefits (often related to meditation) is regarded as part of standard medical treatment rather than alternative medicine, particularly for patients subjected to difficult physical emotional stress in chemotherapy. * Law of attraction ‚Äì the maxim that \\"like attracts like\\" which, in New Thought philosophy, is used to sum up the idea that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts a person brings positive or negative experiences into their life.Whittaker, S. Secret attraction , The Montreal Gazette, 12 May 2007. Skeptical Inquirer magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims. Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self-selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias. Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head. * Memetics ‚Äì approach to evolutionary models of cultural information transfer based on the concept that units of information, or \\"memes\\", have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution through environmental forces. Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of Richard Dawkins, it has since turned into a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics. Memetics has been deemed a pseudoscience on several fronts. Its proponents' assertions have been labeled \\"untested, unsupported or incorrect\\" though the same book contains Susan Blackmore's counter-article \\"Memes as Good Science\\". Supporters of memetics include EO Wilson, Douglas Hofstadter and many others. * Myers‚ÄìBriggs Type Indicator ‚Äì a personality test composed of four categories of two types. The test has consistent problems with repeatability, in addition to problems of whether or not it has exhaustive and mutually exclusive classifications. The four categories are Introversion/Extroversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perception. Each person is said to have one quality from each category, producing 16 unique types. The Center for Applications of Psychological Type claims that the MBTI is scientifically supported, but most of the research on it is done through its own journal, Journal of Psychological Type, raising questions of bias. Results are said to follow the Barnum effect. * Neuro-linguistic programming ‚Äì an approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created in the 1970s. The title refers to a stated connection between the neurological processes (\\"neuro\\"), language (\\"linguistic\\") and behavioral patterns that have been learned through experience (\\"programming\\") and can be organized to achieve specific goals in life. According to certain neuroscientists psychologists and linguists, NLP is unsupported by current scientific evidence, and uses incorrect and misleading terms and concepts. Reviews of empirical research on NLP indicate that NLP contains numerous factual errors, and has failed to produce reliable results for the claims for effectiveness made by NLP's originators and proponents. According to Devilly, NLP is no longer as prevalent as it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Criticisms go beyond the lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness; critics say that NLP exhibits pseudoscientific characteristics, title, concepts and terminology. NLP is used as an example of pseudoscience for facilitating the teaching of scientific literacy at the professional and university level. NLP also appears on peer reviewed expert-consensus based lists of discredited interventions. In research designed to identify the \\"quack factor\\" in modern mental health practice, Norcross et al. (2006) list NLP as possibly or probably discredited, and in papers reviewing discredited interventions for substance and alcohol abuse, Norcross et al. (2008) list NLP in the \\"top ten\\" most discredited, and Glasner-Edwards and Rawson (2010) list NLP as \\"certainly discredited\\". * Parapsychology ‚Äì controversial discipline that seeks to investigate the existence and causes of psychic abilities and life after death using the scientific method. Parapsychological experiments have included the use of random number generators to test for evidence of precognition and psychokinesis with both human and animal subjects and Ganzfeld experiments to test for extrasensory perception. * Phrenology ‚Äì now defunct system for determining personality traits by feeling bumps on the skull proposed by 18th-century physiologist Franz Joseph Gall. In an early recorded use of the term \\"pseudo-science\\", Fran√ßois Magendie referred to phrenology as \\"a pseudo-science of the present day\\". The assumption that personality can be read from bumps in the skull has since been thoroughly discredited. However, Gall's assumption that character, thoughts, and emotions are located in the brain is considered an important historical advance toward neuropsychology (see also Localization of brain function, Brodmann's areas, Neuro-imaging, Modularity of mind or Faculty psychology). * Polygraph (\\"lie detection\\") ‚Äì an interrogation method which measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions. The belief is that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. Many members of the scientific community consider polygraphy to be pseudoscience. Polygraphy has little credibility among scientists. Despite claims of 90‚Äì95% validity by polygraph advocates, and 95‚Äì100% by businesses providing polygraph services, critics maintain that rather than a \\"test\\", the method amounts to an inherently unstandardizable interrogation technique whose accuracy cannot be established. A 1997 survey of 421 psychologists estimated the test's average accuracy at about 61%, a little better than chance. Critics also argue that, even given high estimates of the polygraph's accuracy, a significant number of subjects (e.g., 10% given a 90% accuracy) will appear to be lying, and would unfairly suffer the consequences of \\"failing\\" the polygraph. * Primal therapy ‚Äì sometimes presented as a science. The Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology (2001) states that: \\"The theoretical basis for the therapy is the supposition that prenatal experiences and birth trauma form people's primary impressions of life and that they subsequently influence the direction our lives take ... Truth be known, primal therapy cannot be defended on scientifically established principles. This is not surprising considering its questionable theoretical rationale.\\" Other sources have also questioned the scientific validity of primal therapy, some using the term \\"pseudoscience\\" (see ). * Psychoanalysis ‚Äì body of ideas developed by Austrian physician Sigmund Freud and his followers, which is devoted to the study of human psychological functioning and behavior. Although psychoanalysis is a strong influence within psychiatry, it has been controversial ever since its inception. It is considered pseudoscience by some. Karl Popper characterized it as pseudoscience based on psychoanalysis failing the requirement for falsifiability. Frank Cioffi argued that \\"though Popper is correct to say that psychoanalysis is pseudoscientific and correct to say that it is unfalsifiable, he is mistaken to suggest that it is pseudoscientific because it is unfalsifiable. [...] It is when [Freud] insists that he has confirmed (not just instantiated) [his empirical theses] that he is being pseudoscientific.\\". Reprinted in * Sluggish schizophrenia ‚Äì a diagnosis used in some Communist nations to justify the involuntary commitment of political dissidents to mental institutions.Reich, Walter. The world of Soviet psychiatry. The New York Times. 30 January 1983 accessdate=1 * Subliminal advertising ‚Äì visual or auditory information discerned below the threshold of conscious awareness, which is claimed to have a powerful enduring effect on consuming habits. It went into disrepute in the late 1970s, but there has been renewed research interest recently. The mainstream of accepted scientific opinion does not hold that subliminal perception has a powerful, enduring effect on human behaviour. * Trepanning, also known as trepanation, trephination, trephining or making a burr hole (the verb trepan derives from Old French from Medieval Latin trepanum from Greek trypanon, literally \\"borer, auger\\") is a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the human skull, exposing the dura mater, to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases or release pressured blood buildup from an injury. It may also refer to any \\"burr\\" hole created through other body surfaces, including nail beds. It is often used to relieve pressure beneath a surface. A trephine is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone. = Racial theories = * Scientific racism ‚Äì claim that scientific evidence shows the inferiority or superiority of certain races. :*Aryanism ‚Äì the claim that there is a distinct \\"Aryan race\\" which is superior to other putative races,Regal, Brian. 2009. Pseudoscience: a critical encyclopedia Greenwood Press. pp. 27‚Äì29 was an important tenet of Nazism, and \\"the basis of the German government policy of exterminating Jews, Gypsies, and other 'non- Aryans.'\\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Aryan. \\"This notion, which had been repudiated by anthropologists by the second quarter of the 20th century, was seized upon by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and made the basis of the German government policy of exterminating Jews, Gypsies, and other 'non-Aryans.'\\". :* Drapetomania was a conjectural mental illness that, in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized as the cause of enslaved Africans fleeing captivity. It has since been debunked as pseudoscience and part of the edifice of scientific racism. :* Melanin theory ‚Äì belief founded in the distortion of known physical properties of melanin, a natural polymer, that posits the inherent superiority of dark-skinned people and the essential inhumanity and inferiority of light-skinned people. :*Turkish History Thesis ‚Äì the belief that Turks from Central Asia migrated and brought civilization to China, India, the Middle East, and Europe. :*Sun Language Theory ‚Äì the belief that all languages had their origins in the Turkish language. =Sociology= * Unilineal evolution ‚Äì Before Darwin's work On the Origin of Species, some models incorporated Enlightenment ideas of social progress, and thus, according to philosopher of science Michael Ruse, were pseudoscientific by current standards, and may have been viewed as such during the 18th century, as well as into the start of the 19th century (though the word pseudoscience may not have been used in reference to these early proposals). This pseudoscientific, and often political, incorporation of social progress with evolutionary thought continued for some 100 years following the publication of Origin of Species.  Paranormal and ufology  Paranormal subjectsstatement from the Russian Academy of Sciences. have been subject to critiques from a wide range of sources including the following claims of paranormal significance: * Animal mutilations ‚Äì cases of animals, primarily domestic livestock, with seemingly inexplicable wounds. These wounds have been said to be caused by extraterrestrials, cults, covert government organizations, or cryptids such as el chupacabra, when in fact most such cases were found to be caused by natural predation. * An aura or human energy field is, according to New Age beliefs, a colored emanation said to enclose a human body or any animal or object. In some esoteric positions, the aura is described as a subtle body. Psychics and holistic medicine practitioners often claim to have the ability to see the size, color and type of vibration of an aura. In New Age alternative medicine, the human aura is seen as a hidden anatomy that affect the health of a client, and is often understood to comprise centers of vital force called chakra. Such claims are not supported by scientific evidence and are pseudoscience. When tested under controlled experiments, the ability to see auras has not been shown to exist. * Channeling ‚Äì communication of information to or through a person allegedly from a spirit or other paranormal entity. * Crop circles ‚Äì geometric designs of crushed or knocked- over crops created in a field. Aside from skilled farmers or pranksters working through the night, explanations for their formation include UFOs and anomalous, tornado-like air currents. The study of crop circles has become known as \\"cerealogy\\". * Cryptozoology ‚Äì search for creatures that are considered not to exist by most biologists. Well-known examples of creatures of interest to cryptozoologists include Bigfoot, the Yeren, the Yeti, and the Loch Ness Monster. According to leading skeptical authors Michael Shermer and Pat Linse, \\"Cryptozoology ranges from pseudoscientific to useful and interesting, depending on how it is practiced.\\" * Dowsing refers to practices said to enable one to detect hidden water, metals, gemstones or other objects. * Electronic voice phenomenon ‚Äì purported communication by spirits through tape recorders and other electronic devices. * Extra-sensory perception ‚Äì paranormal ability (independent of the five main senses or deduction from previous experience) to acquire information by means such as telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychometry, psychic abilities, and remote viewing. * Ghost hunting is the process of investigating locations that are reported to be haunted by ghosts. Typically, a ghost-hunting team will attempt to collect evidence supporting the existence of paranormal activity. Ghost hunters use a variety of electronic devices, including EMF meters, digital thermometers, both handheld and static digital video cameras, including thermographic and night vision cameras, as well as digital audio recorders. Other more traditional techniques are also used, such as conducting interviews and researching the history of allegedly haunted sites. Ghost hunters may also refer to themselves as \\"paranormal investigators.\\" Ghost hunting has been heavily criticized for its dismissal of the scientific method. No scientific study has ever been able to confirm the existence of ghosts. The practice is considered a pseudoscience by the vast majority of educators, academics, science writers, and skeptics.Regal, Brian. (2009). Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia. Greenwood. pp. 43; 75‚Äì77. Science historian Brian Regal described ghost hunting as \\"an unorganized exercise in futility\\". * Lizard people - The idea of a reptilian reconquest was popularized by David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens control Earth by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate human societies. Icke has stated on multiple occasions that many world leaders are, or are possessed by, so-called reptilians. * Levitation ‚Äì act of rising up from the ground without any physical aids, usually by the power of thought. * Palmistry ‚Äì the belief that the future can be foretold through palm reading. Predictions are based on the shape, line, and mounts of the hands. Palmists use cold reading in order to appear psychic. * Parapsychology ‚Äì (see Psychology section above) * Pseudoarchaeology ‚Äì investigation of the ancient past using alleged paranormal or other means which have not been validated by mainstream science. * Psychic surgery ‚Äì a type of medical fraud, popular in Brazil and the Philippines. Practitioners use sleight of hand to make it appear as though they are reaching into a patient's body and extracting \\"tumors\\". Psychic surgery is usually explicit deception; i.e., the \\"practitioners\\" are aware that they are practicing fraud or \\"quackery\\". * Psychokinesis ‚Äì paranormal ability of the mind to influence matter or energy at a distance. * Rumpology ‚Äì neologism referring to a pseudoscience akin to physiognomy, performed by examining crevices, dimples, warts, moles and folds of a person's buttocks in much the same way a chirologist would read the palm of the hand. * S√©ances ‚Äì ritualized attempts to communicate with the dead. * The Tunguska event was an actual large explosion, possibly caused by a meteoroid or comet, in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia in June 1908. Night skies as far away as London were markedly brighter for several evenings. Unsupported theories regarding the event include the impact of a miniature black hole or large body of antimatter, ball lightning, a test by Nikola Tesla of the apparatus at Wardenclyffe Tower, and a UFO crash.\\"Russian Alien Spaceship Claims Raise Eyebrows, Skepticism\\", Robert Roy Britt, SPACE.com Another theory is that the explosion was caused by a piece of Biela's Comet from 1883. * Ufology ‚Äì the study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that sometimes includes the belief that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial visitors.  Numerology  * Numerology (including the numerology practices of Kabbalah) ‚Äì a set of beliefs in a divine, mystical, or other special relationship between a number and coinciding events. Numerology is regarded as pseudomathematics or pseudoscience by modern scientists. It is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar divinatory arts. * Scriptural codes ‚Äì the belief that a book or fragment of holy scripture contains encoded messages that impart esoteric knowledge. One such decoding method involves identifying \\"equidistant letter sequences\\" that spell out such messages.  Religious and spiritual beliefs  Spiritual and religious practices and beliefs, according to astronomer Carl Sagan, are normally not classified as pseudoscience. However, religion can sometimes nurture pseudoscience, and \\"at the extremes it is difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from rigid, doctrinaire religion\\", and some religions might be confused with pseudoscience, such as traditional meditation. The following religious/spiritual items have been related to or classified as pseudoscience in some way: * Affirmative prayer is a form of prayer or a metaphysical technique that is focused on a positive outcome, rather than a negative situation. For instance, a person who is experiencing some form of illness would focus the prayer on the desired state of perfect health and affirm this desired intention \\"as if already happened\\" rather than identifying the illness and then asking God for help to eliminate it. William James described affirmative prayer as an element of the American metaphysical healing movement that he called the \\"mind-cure\\"; he described it as America's \\"only decidedly original contribution to the systemic philosophy of life.\\" What sets affirmative prayer apart from secular affirmations of the autosuggestion type taught by the 19th century self-help author √âmile Cou√© (whose most famous affirmation was \\"Every day in every way, I am getting better and better\\") is that affirmative prayer addresses the practitioner to God, the Divine, the Creative Mind, emphasizing the seemingly practical aspects of religious belief. * Exorcism (from Greek ·ºêŒæŒøœÅŒ∫ŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ, exorkism√≥s \\"binding by oath\\") is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, that is believed to be possessed. Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist, this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate ritual, or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power. The practice is ancient and part of the belief system of many cultures and religions. Requested and performed exorcism began to decline in the United States by the 18th century and occurred rarely until the latter half of the 20th century, when the public saw a sharp rise due to the media attention exorcisms were getting. There was \\"a 50% increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s\\". * Energy is used by writers and practitioners of various esoteric forms of spirituality and alternative medicine to refer to a variety of claimed experiences and phenomena that defy measurement and thus can be distinguished from the scientific form of energy. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of such energy. Therapies that purport to use, modify, or manipulate unknown energies are thus among the most contentious of all complementary and alternative medicines. Claims related to energy therapies are most often anecdotal (from single stories), rather than being based on repeatable empirical evidence. * Koranic scientific foreknowledge (Islam) ‚Äì Koranic Science (or Qur'anic science or Hadeeth science) asserts that foundational Islamic religious texts made accurate statements about the world that science verified hundreds of years later. This belief is a common theme in Bucailleism. * Christian Science is generally considered a Christian new religious movement; however, some have called it \\"pseudoscience\\" because its founder, Mary Baker Eddy, used \\"science\\" in its name, and because of its former stance against medical science. Also, \\"Eddy used the term Metaphysical science to distinguish her system both from materialistic science and from occult science.\\"Religious outsiders and the making of Americans Robert Laurence Moore; Oxford University Press 1986, p. 223 The church now accepts the use of medical science. Vaccinations were banned, but in 1901, Eddy, at the age of 80, advised her followers to submit to them. = Creation science = Creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about geology, cosmology, biological evolution, archaeology, history and linguistics. * Creationist cosmologies ‚Äì cosmologies which, among other things, allow for a universe that is only thousands of years old. * Baraminology ‚Äì taxonomic system that classifies animals into groups called \\"created kinds\\" or \\"baramins\\" according to the account of creation in the book of Genesis and other parts of the Bible. * Creation biology ‚Äì subset of creation science that tries to explain biology without macroevolution. * Flood geology ‚Äì creationist form of geology that advocates most of the geologic features on Earth are explainable by a global flood.Such as the existence of the geologic column; see * Searches for Noah's Ark ‚Äì attempts to find the burial site of Noah's Ark that, according to the Genesis flood narrative, is located somewhere in the alleged \\"Mountains of Ararat\\". There have been numerous expeditions with several false claims of success; the practice is widely regarded as pseudoscience, more specifically pseudoarchaeology. * Intelligent design ‚Äì maintains that \\"certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.\\" These features include: :* Irreducible complexity ‚Äì claim that some biological systems are too complex to have evolved from simpler systems. It is used by proponents of intelligent design to argue that evolution by natural selection alone is incomplete or flawed, and that some additional mechanism (an \\"Intelligent Designer\\") is required to explain the origins of life.\\"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large.\\" s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 79 of 139 Ruling, Judge John E. Jones III, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District :* Specified complexity ‚Äì claim that when something is simultaneously complex and specified, one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. = Scientology = * Dianetics, a therapeutic technique promoted by Scientology, purports to treat a hypothetical reactive mind. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of an actual reactive mind, apart from the stimulus response mechanisms documented in behaviorist psychology. * Scientology's Purification Rundown and Narconon programs purport to clean the human body of toxins and drugs respectively. Their method consists of very long saunas over many days, extremely large (possibly toxic) doses of vitamins including niacin, and Scientology 'training routines', sometimes including attempts at telekenesis. The programs have been described as \\"medically unsafe\\", \\"quackery\\" and \\"medical fraud\\", while academic and medical experts have dismissed Narconon's educational programme as containing \\"factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling\\". In turn, Narconon has claimed that mainstream medicine is \\"biased\\" against it, and that \\"people who endorse so-called controlled drug use cannot be trusted to review a program advocating totally drug-free living.\\" Narconon has said that criticism of its programmes is \\"bigoted\\", and that its critics are \\"in favor of drug abuse [...] they are either using drugs or selling drugs\\". = Other = * Transcendental Meditation (TM) refers to a specific form of silent mantra meditation and less commonly to the organizations that constitute the Transcendental Meditation movement. The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi created and introduced the TM technique and TM movement in India in the mid-1950s. It is not possible to say whether meditation has any effect on health, as the research is of poor quality, and is marred by a high risk for bias due to the connection of researchers to the TM organization and by the selection of subjects with a favorable opinion of TM. * Quantum mysticism ‚Äì builds on a superficial similarity between certain New Age concepts and such seemingly counter-intuitive quantum mechanical concepts as the uncertainty principle, entanglement, and wave‚Äìparticle duality, while generally ignoring the limitations imposed by quantum decoherence. One of the most abused ideas is Bell's theorem, which proves the nonexistence of local hidden variables in quantum mechanics. Despite this, Bell himself rejected mystical interpretations of the theory.  Idiosyncratic ideas  The following concepts have only a very small number of proponents, yet have become notable: * Aquatic ape hypothesis ‚Äì the idea that certain ancestors of modern humans were more aquatic than other great apes and even many modern humans and, as such, were habitual waders, swimmers and divers. * Lawsonomy ‚Äì proposed philosophy and system of claims about physics made by baseball player and aviator Alfred William Lawson. * Morphic resonance ‚Äì The idea put forth by Rupert Sheldrake that \\"natural systems, such as termite colonies, or pigeons, or orchid plants, or insulin molecules, inherit a collective memory from all previous things of their kind\\". It is also claimed to be responsible for \\"mysterious telepathy-type interconnections between organisms\\". * N rays ‚Äì A hypothesized form of radiation described by Prosper-Ren√© Blondlot in 1903 which briefly inspired significant scientific interest, but were subsequently found to have been a result of confirmation bias. * Penta Water ‚Äì claimed acoustically induced structural reorganization of liquid water into long-lived small clusters of five molecules each. Neither these clusters nor their asserted benefits to humans have been shown to exist.Water Cluster Quackery. The junk science of structure-altered waters, Stephen Lower * Polywater ‚Äì hypothetical polymerized form of water proposed in the 1960s with a higher boiling point, lower freezing point, and much higher viscosity than ordinary water. It was later found not to exist, with the anomalous measurements being explained by biological contamination. Chains of molecules of varying length (depending on the temperature) tend to form in normal liquid water without changing the freezing or boiling point. * Time Cube ‚Äì a website created by Gene Ray, in 1997, where he sets out his personal model of reality, which he calls Time Cube. He suggests that all of modern physics is wrong, and his Time Cube model proposes that each day is really four separate days occurring simultaneously.\\"Truth is cubic?\\", by Kate Duffy,The Phoenix, Swarthmore College, 19 September 2002. Archived by the Internet Archive, archive copy retrieved 25 July 2010. * Timewave zero ‚Äì numerological formula that was invented by psychonaut Terence McKenna with the help of the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine. After experiencing 2012 doomsday predictions, he redesigned his formula to have a \\"zero-point\\" at the same date as the Mayan longcount calendar.Dynamics of Hyperspace * Torsion field ‚Äì hypothetical physical field responsible for extra-sensory perception, homeopathic cures, levitation, telepathy, clairvoyance, telekinesis, and other paranormal phenomena. Despite the several obvious contradictions with established physics along with associated statements by believers criticized as being \\"nonsensical\\" by reputable scientists, torsion fields have been embraced as an explanation for claims of such paranormal phenomena. The harnessing of torsion fields has been claimed to make everything possible from miracle cure devices (including devices that cure alcohol addiction) to working perpetual motion machines, stargates, UFO propulsion analogs, and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Some such devices, in particular the miracle cure boxes, have been patented, manufactured and sold.

Its epicenter was in Reseda, a neighborhood in the north-central area of the San Fernando Valley. The quake had a duration of approximately 10‚Äì20 seconds, and its peak ground acceleration of https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70208422USGS Earthquake Information for 1994 \\"Significant Earthquakes of the World 1994\\" was the highest ever instrumentally recorded in an urban area in North America.Northridge Earthquake Southern California Earthquake Data Center. Retrieved October 6, 2006. Strong ground motion was felt as far away as Las Vegas, Nevada, about from the epicenter. The peak ground velocity at the Rinaldi Receiving Station was , the fastest ever recorded. Two 6.0 aftershocks followed, the first about one minute after the initial event and the second approximately 11 hours later, the strongest of several thousand aftershocks in all. The death toll was 57, with more than 8,700 injured. In addition, property damage was estimated to be $13‚Äì50 billion (equivalent to $‚Äì billion in 2014), making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. Epicenter The earthquake struck in the San Fernando Valley about northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Although given the name \\"Northridge\\", where the quake was believed to have been centered and substantial damage occurred, the actual epicenter was pinpointed in the neighboring community of Reseda within several days. The National Geophysical Data Center placed the hypocenter's geographical coordinates at and at a depth of . It occurred on a previously undiscovered fault, now named the Northridge blind thrust fault (also known as the Pico thrust fault). Several other faults experienced minor rupture during the main shock and other ruptures occurred during large aftershocks, or triggered events. Damage and fatalities Residential damage in Santa Monica Interstate 10 that collapsed Collapsed section (left of police car) and sag leading to it Kaiser Permanente building Apartment building that collapsed onto its own footprint, crushing cars parked beneath it Buckled pavement Damage occurred up to away, with the most damage in the west San Fernando Valley, and the cities and neighborhoods of Santa Monica, Hollywood, Simi Valley and Santa Clarita. The Historic Egyptian Theater in Hollywood was red- tagged and closed as was the Capital Theater in Glendale due to structural damage. The exact number of fatalities is unknown, with sources estimating it at 60 or \\"over 60\\", to 72,Reich, K. Study raises Northridge quake death toll to 72. Los Angeles Times December 20, 1995 where most estimates fall around 60. The \\"official\\" death toll was placed at 57; 33 people died immediately or within a few days from injuries sustained, and many died from indirect causes, such as stress-induced cardiac events. Some counts factor in related events such as a man's suicide possibly inspired by the loss of his business in the disaster. More than 8,700 were injured including 1,600 who required hospitalization. Actress Iris Adrian died in September 1994 from complications of a broken hip she suffered in the earthquake.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-iris- adrian-1440804.html Sixteen people were killed as a result of the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex. The Northridge Fashion Center and California State University, Northridge also sustained very heavy damage ‚Äì most notably the collapse of parking structures. The earthquake also gained worldwide attention because of damage to the vast freeway network, which serves millions of commuters every day. The most notable was to the Santa Monica Freeway, Interstate 10, known as the busiest freeway in the United States, congesting nearby surface roads for three months while the freeway was repaired. Farther north, the Newhall Pass interchange of Interstate 5 (the Golden State Freeway) and State Route 14 (the Antelope Valley Freeway) collapsed as it had 23 years earlier in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, even though it had been rebuilt with minor improvements to the structural components. LAPD motorcycle officer Clarence Wayne Dean died because of the collapse of the Newhall Pass interchange, falling 40 feet from the damaged connector from southbound 14 to southbound I-5. He likely did not realize until too late in the early morning darkness that the elevated roadway had collapsed. The rebuilt interchange was renamed in his honor a year later. Additional damage occurred about southeast in the city of Anaheim, located in Orange County, as the scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium collapsed onto several hundred seats. The stadium was vacant at the time. Although several commercial buildings also collapsed, loss of life was minimized because of the early morning hour of the quake, and because it also occurred on a federal holiday (Martin Luther King Jr. Day). Also, because of known seismic activity in California, area building codes dictate that buildings incorporate structural design intended to withstand earthquakes. However, the damage revealed that some structural specifications did not perform as intended. Because of these revelations, building codes were revised. Some structures were not red-tagged until months later because the damage was not immediately evident. The quake produced unusually strong ground accelerations in the range of 1.0 g. Damage was also caused by fire and landslides. The Northridge earthquake was notable for hitting almost the same exact area as the 6.6 San Fernando (Sylmar) earthquake. Estimates of total damage range between $13 and $40 billion. Most casualties and damage occurred in multi-story wood frame buildings (such as the three-story Northridge Meadows apartment building). In particular, buildings with an unstable first floor (such as those with parking areas on the bottom) performed poorly. Numerous fires were also caused by broken gas lines from houses shifting off their foundations or unsecured water heaters tumbling. In the San Fernando Valley, several underground gas and water lines were severed, resulting in some streets experiencing simultaneous fires and floods. Damage to the system resulted in water pressure dropping to zero in some areas; this predictably affected success in fighting subsequent fires. Five days later, it was estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 customers were still without public water service. As expected, unreinforced masonry buildings and houses on steep slopes suffered damage. However, school buildings (K-12), which are required by California law to be reinforced, in general, survived fairly well. Valley fever outbreak An unusual effect of the Northridge earthquake was an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) in Ventura County. This respiratory disease is caused by inhaling airborne spores of the fungus. The 203 cases reported, of which three resulted in fatalities, constituted roughly 10 times the normal rate in the initial eight weeks. This was the first report of such an outbreak following an earthquake, and it is believed that the spores were carried in large clouds of dust created by seismically triggered landslides.Schneider, E., Hajjeh, R. A., Spiegel, R. A., Jibson, R. W., Harp, E. L., Marshall, G. A., . . . Werner, S. B. (1997). A coccidioidomycosis outbreak following the Northridge, Calif, earthquake. Jama, 277(11), 904-908. Most of the cases occurred immediately downwind of the landslides. Facilities and infrastructure affected =Hospitals= Eleven hospitals suffered structural damage and were damaged or rendered unusable. Not only were they unable to serve their local neighborhoods, but they also had to transfer out their inpatient populations, which further increased the burden on nearby hospitals that were still operational. As a result, the state legislature passed a law requiring all hospitals in California to ensure that their acute care units and emergency rooms would be in earthquake-resistant buildings by January 1, 2005. Most were unable to meet this deadline and only managed to achieve compliance in 2008 or 2009. =Television, movie, and music productions= The production of movies and TV shows was disrupted. At the time of the quake, before dawn on Monday morning, the Warner Bros. film Murder in the First (with Christian Slater, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Oldman) was actually being filmed only from the epicenter. Production came to a halt. The main courtroom set was in shambles. The building containing the set was later \\"red tagged\\" as unsafe due to the damage it sustained. The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Profit and Loss\\" was being filmed at the time, and actors Armin Shimerman and Edward Wiley left the Paramount Pictures lot in full Ferengi and Cardassian makeup, respectively. The season five episode of Seinfeld entitled \\"The Pie\\" was due to begin shooting on January 17 before stage sets were damaged. NBC's The Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno, took place in the NBC Studios in Burbank, close to the epicenter of the quake. Also, ABC's General Hospital, which shoots in Los Angeles, was heavily affected. The set, which is at ABC Television Center, suffered major damage, including partial structural collapse and water damage. All of the earthquake sequences in the Wes Craven film New Nightmare were filmed a month prior to the Northridge quake. The real quake struck only weeks before filming was completed. Subsequently, a team was sent out to film footage of the quake-damaged areas of the city. The cast and crew had initially thought that the scenes that were filmed before the real quake struck were a bit overdone, but upon viewing the footage after the earthquake, they were reportedly startled by the realism of it. Some archives of film and entertainment programming were also affected. For example, the original 35 mm master films for the 1960s sitcom My Living Doll were destroyed.Susan King, \\"The 'perfect' '60s woman\\", Los Angeles Times, April 4, 2012; retrieved April 14, 2012 The first and second episodes of the fifth season of Baywatch featured the earthquake, and how the lifeguards responded to it, professionally and personally. The Animaniacs segment \\"A Quake! A Quake!\\" tells the story of the event. =Transportation= Complete failure of Golden State Freeway at Gavin Canyon Portions of a number of major roads and freeways, including Interstate 10 over La Cienega Boulevard, and the interchanges of Interstate 5 with California State Route 14, 118, and Interstate 210, were closed because of structural failure or collapse. James E. Roberts was chief bridge engineer with Caltrans and was placed in charge of the seismic retrofit program for Caltrans until his death in 2006. Rail service was briefly interrupted, with full Amtrak and expanded Metrolink service resuming in stages in the days after the quake. Interruptions to road transport caused Metrolink to experiment with service to Camarillo in February and Oxnard in April, which continues today as the Ventura County Line, and extended the Antelope Valley Line almost ten years ahead of schedule. Six new stations opened in six weeks. Metrolink leased equipment from Amtrak, San Francisco's Caltrain and Toronto, Canada's GO Transit to handle the sudden onslaught of passengers. Amtrak ceased service in the Pasadena Subdivision following structural damage to a rail bridge in Arcadia and redirected all rail traffic through Riverside and Fullerton. All MTA bus lines operated service with detours and delays on the day of the quake. Los Angeles International Airport and other airports in the area were also shut down as a 2-hour precaution, including Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (now Hollywood Burbank Airport) and Van Nuys Airport, which is near the epicenter, where the control tower suffered from radar failure and panel collapse. The airport was reopened in stages after the quake. =California State University, Northridge= California State University, Northridge, was the closest university to the epicenter. Many campus buildings were heavily damaged and a parking structure collapsed. Many classes were moved to temporary structures. The 1994 Northridge earthquake greatly affected the CSUN campus, damaging much of its infrastructure, and causing multiple fires and explosions throughout the campus. The 6.7 magnitude earthquake damaged several buildings as well as destroying all communications, such as telephone lines and causing computer systems to shut down. The seismic event killed two CSUN students at the Northridge Meadows Complex along with 14 other residents. The damage caused a shutdown of the campus and delayed the start of the 1994 Spring semester.  Campus damage  All 58 buildings on campus sustained significant damage, resulting in a $406 million recovery effort (equivalent to $ million today). In addition, the newly completed student parking structure C collapsed, and had to be demolished. The Oviatt Library experienced both interior and exterior damage, but the overall frame of the central part of the building remained stable, allowing student use to continue. In the Science Complex, Building #1 and #2 suffered fire damage while the bridges connecting buildings #3 #4 were closed and named unstable. The Fine Arts Building and the South Library experienced internal structural damage, resulting in the demolition and replacement of both buildings.  Classes and enrollment  The 1994 Spring semester was delayed by two weeks due to the Northridge earthquake. The campus was unable to use any of its classrooms because of the damage the buildings sustained. The campus still opened and provided students with mobile classrooms and mobile offices. CSUN President Dr. Blenda Wilson assured the rental of temporary structures to be placed in available spaces throughout the campus. An estimated $350 million (equivalent to $ million today) was used to supply the number of trailers and domes which housed classes and administration offices. Enrollment dropped by approximately 1,000 students, leaving some homeless as dormitories were closed due to damage which rendered them unsafe and which required repair. \\"An earthquake is the shifting of land, a force of nature that affects the natural, built and economic landscape\\"-Lauretta Wasserstein Sculpture Garden  External resources  The seismic event led to millions of dollars worth damage resulting in a sharp drop in student enrollment. Fortunately, CSUN received financial assistance for its efforts in reestablishing the damaged buildings with monetary gifts from the McCarthy Foundation, the Common Wealth Fund, and the Union Bank Foundation. In addition, the campus received a $23,000 check (equivalent to $ today) from the Los Angeles Times Valley Edition for the journalism department. CSUN also received assistance from government agencies FEMA and OES to support the recovery effort and serve the needs of the local community. UCLA and Pierce College opened their doors and allowed CSUN students to use their libraries while providing shuttle buses to and from the university. =Entertainment and sports= Universal Studios Hollywood shut down the Earthquake attraction, based on the 1974 motion picture blockbuster, Earthquake. It was closed for the second time since the Loma Prieta earthquake. Angel Stadium of Anaheim (then known as Anaheim Stadium) suffered some damage when the scoreboard fell into the seats. The theme parks Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain were shut down after the quake, but only for inspections since all were designed with earthquakes in mind. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and now-gone Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena suffered minor damage. The major Hollywood film studios including Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Studios and Universal Studios were also shut down. The recording venues Capitol Records and Warner Bros. Records were shut down at the time of the quake. British musicians Paul Hardcastle and Simon Harris narrowly escaped injury and were among guests evacuated when the Sheraton- Universal Hotel in Universal City, California where they were staying was damaged during the earthquake. The Los Angeles Clippers of the NBA had three home games postponed or moved to other venues. The game scheduled against the Sacramento Kings was postponed, the game against the Cleveland Cavaliers was relocated to The Forum (then the home arena of the Los Angeles Lakers), and the game against the New York Knicks was moved to the Arrowhead Pond (now Honda Center) in Anaheim. =Other buildings= Numerous Los Angeles museums, including the Art Deco Building in Hollywood, were closed, as were numerous city shopping malls. Gazzarri's nightclub suffered irreparable damage and had to be torn down. The city of Santa Monica suffered significant damage. Many multifamily apartment buildings in Santa Monica were yellow-tagged and red- tagged. Especially hard hit was the area between Santa Monica Canyon and Saint John's Hospital, a linear corridor that suffered a significant amount of property damage. The City of Santa Monica provided assistance to landlords dealing with repairs so tenants could return home as soon as possible. In Valencia, the California Institute of the Arts experienced heavy damage, with classes relocated to a nearby Lockheed test facility for the remainder of 1994. The Los Angeles Unified School District closed local schools throughout the area, which reopened one week later. UCLA and other local universities were also shut down. The University of Southern California suffered some structural damage to several older campus buildings, but classes were conducted as scheduled. =Radio and television= Los Angeles' radio and television stations were knocked off the air, but resumed coverage later. NBC station KNBC was the first television station to go on the air, with reporter Joe Rico beginning the station's coverage just two minutes after the earthquake began while anchors Kent Shocknek, Carla Aragon, Colleen Williams and Chuck Henry were producing special reports throughout the morning. Other local television stations, including KTLA, KCAL-TV, KCBS-TV and KABC-TV, were also knocked off the air. Afterward, anchors and reporters Stan Chambers and Hal Fishman of KTLA, Laura Diaz and Harold Greene of KABC, John Beard of KTTV, and Michael Tuck, Linda Alvarez and Tritia Toyota of KCBS were doing coverage throughout the day. Radio stations such as KFI, KFWB and KNX were on the air during the main tremor, which caused their signals to get very noisy. KROQ- FM's Kevin and Bean morning show asked those people tuned in to stay out of their homes. Mark & Brian's morning show on KLOS was also affected. The duo spoke to Los Angeles-area residents about their situation. FM radio stations such as KRTH, KIIS, KOST and KCBS radio were bringing special reports when morning show hosts Robert W. Morgan, Rick Dees and Charlie Tuna were calling Los Angeles residents and others from their sister stations to bring their belongings to the stations and advising people not to drink water. =Government and organizations= The United States Postal Service suspended all mail service throughout the Los Angeles area for several days. The Los Angeles Public Library shut down most of its branches; books were knocked down during the quake. The Los Angeles City Hall suffered no damage. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan declared a state of emergency and issued curfews in the area, while Governor Pete Wilson and President Bill Clinton visited Los Angeles to tour the area. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles's Cathedral of St. Vibiana suffered severe damage and canceled activities until a new cathedral was built in 2002. The Church on the Way, which is near the epicenter, suffered moderate damage to the church campus building. The Martin Luther King Jr. Parade, scheduled to take place on January 17, was not held. Aftermath = Lifestyle disruptions in the weeks following = In the weeks following the quake, many San Fernando Valley residents had either lost their homes entirely or experienced structural damage too severe to continue living in them without making repairs. Although the vast majority of homes in the area, with the exception of a few particular neighborhoods, were relatively unaffected; many feared an aftershock to rival or exceed the severity of the first one. While a notable aftershock never came, many residents opted to stay in shelters or live with friends and family outside the area for a short time following. While many businesses remained closed in the days following the quake, some infrastructure was not able to be rebuilt for months, even years later. The daily commute for many drivers in the weeks following was significantly lengthened, notably for those traveling between Santa Clarita and Los Angeles, and commuters on I-10 traveling to and from the Westside. Additionally, many businesses were forced to relocate or use temporary facilities in order to accommodate structural damage to their original locations or the difficulty accessing them. Some people even made temporary relocations closer to their jobs while their homes or neighborhoods were being rebuilt. =State legislative response= The Northridge earthquake led to a number of legislative changes. Due to the large amount lost by insurance companies, most insurance companies either stopped offering or severely restricted earthquake insurance in California. In response, the California Legislature created the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), which is a publicly managed but privately funded organization that offers minimal coverage. A substantial effort was also made to reinforce freeway bridges against seismic shaking, and a law requiring water heaters to be properly strapped was passed in 1995. =Engineering analysis= The analysis of the effect of Northridge earthquake on behavior of structures has been investigated by many researchers. For example, the behavior of underground walls has been evaluated for the Northridge earthquake using numerical methods. The comparison of the seismic behavior of underground braced walls with ACI 318 design method reveals that bending moment and shear force of the walls under Northridge earthquake loads were observed to reach 2.8 and 2.7 times as large as the respective allowable limits. Therefore, caution should be taken in seismic design of diaphragm walls using ACI 318 code requirements.

Marie Joseph Fran√ßois Garnier (; 25 July 1839 ‚Äì 21 December 1873) was a French officer, inspector of Indigenous Affairs of Cochinchina and explorer. He eventually became mission leader of the Mekong Exploration Commission in 19th century Southeast Asia. Early career Garnier was born on July 25, 1839 at Saint-√âtienne, Loire, and entered the French Navy, and after voyaging in Brazilian waters and the Pacific, he obtained a post on the staff of Admiral L√©onard Victor Charner, who from February 1860 to November 1861 was campaigning in Cochinchina. Mekong Exploration Commission. Garnier at the left. After some time spent in France, Garnier returned to the East, and in 1862, he was appointed inspector of native affairs in Cochinchina, and entrusted with the administration of Cholon, a suburb of Saigon.  Exploration of the Mekong and Yangtze rivers  It was at his suggestion that the marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat determined to send a mission to explore the valley of the Mekong River, but as Garnier was not considered old enough to be put in command, the chief authority was entrusted to Captain Ernest Doudard de Lagr√©e. In the course of the expedition ‚Äì to quote the words of Sir Roderick Murchison addressed to the youthful traveller when, in 1870, he was presented with the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London ‚Äì \\"from Krati√© in Cambodia to Shanghai 5392 miles were traversed, and of these, 3625 miles, chiefly of country unknown to European geography, were surveyed with care, and the positions fixed by astronomical observations, nearly the whole of the observations being taken by Garnier himself\\". A year earlier he received an award to be shared with David Livingstone at the 1869 Geographical Congress in Antwerp. Volunteering to lead a detachment to Dali, the capital of Sultan Suleiman, the sovereign of the Muslim rebels in Yunnan, Garnier successfully carried out the more-than- adventurous enterprise. When shortly afterwards Lagr√©e died, Garnier naturally assumed the command of the expedition, and he conducted it in safety to the Yangtze River, and thus to the Chinese coast. On his return to France, he was received with enthusiasm. The preparation of his narrative was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War, and during the siege of Paris, Garnier served as principal staff officer to the admiral in command of the eighth sector. His experiences during the siege were published anonymously in the feuilleton of Le Temps, and appeared separately as Le Si√®ge de Paris, journal d'un officier de marine (1871). Returning to Cochinchina, he found the political circumstances of the country unfavourable to further exploration, so accordingly, he went to China, and in 1873 followed the upper course of the Yangtze River to the waterfalls.  Intervention in Tonkin  Ceremonial dress of Marshall Nguy·ªÖn Tri Ph∆∞∆°ng, taken as a trophy by Garnier in the capture of Hanoi in 1873. Garnier met his death in controversial circumstances. In late 1873 he was sent by Admiral Dupr√©, the governor of Cochinchina, to Tonkin, to resolve a dispute between the Vietnamese authorities and the French entrepreneur Jean Dupuis. Persuaded that the time was ripe for a French conquest of Tonkin, Garnier captured Hanoi, the capital of Tonkin, 20 November 1873. In the next few weeks a small French force under Garnier's command captured most of the citadels of the Red River Delta. The Vietnamese authorities, despairing of meeting the French with their own forces, appealed to the notorious Chinese soldier of fortune Liu Yongfu to come to their aid with his Black Flag Army.  Defeat and death  On 21 December 1873 Liu Yongfu and around 600 Black Flags (, ), marching beneath an enormous black banner, approached the west gate of Hanoi. A large Vietnamese army followed in their wake. Garnier began shelling the Black Flags with a field piece mounted above the gate, and when they began to fall back he led a party of 18 French marine infantrymen out of the city to chase them away. The attack failed. Garnier, leading three men uphill in a bayonet attack on a party of Black Flags, was stabbed and hacked to death by several Black Flag soldiers after stumbling in a watercourse. The youthful enseigne de vaisseau Adrien-Paul Balny d'Avricourt led an equally small column out of the citadel to support Garnier, but was also killed at the head of his men. Three French soldiers were also killed in these sorties, and the others fled back to the citadel after their officers fell.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 126‚Äì8 Colonel Thomazi, the historian of French Indochina, gave the following detailed description of Garnier's last moments: > At midday on 21 December he was in conference with the ambassadors when an > interpreter ran up, announcing that bands of Black Flags were attacking the > town by the western gate. He immediately hurried to the spot, but some of > his men had got there before him, and their fire had sufficed to force the > bandits to retreat behind the bamboo hedges. A 40-millimetre gun arrived at > this moment. Garnier rallied a dozen men, three of whom dragged this small > cannon, and left the town at a run to pursue the enemy. As the gun could not > move quickly enough across the fields, he left it behind with its gunners. > He then divided the nine men who remained with him into three groups. The > first two groups moved off to the left and the right, to rejoin one another > further on, while he marched in the middle, followed only by two men. One > and a half kilometres from the town he found himself in front of a dyke, and > slipped and fell while trying to cross it. Some Black Flags hidden behind > the dyke ran out, while others opened fire. At this moment the two men who > were accompanying Garnier were 100 metres behind him. One of them was killed > by a bullet and the other wounded. Garnier cried, 'To me, brave boys, and > we'll give them a thrashing!' He then fired the six rounds from his revolver > in an attempt to rescue himself, but the bandits surrounded him, pierced him > with thrusts of sabres and lances, cut off his head, odiously mutilated his > corpse, and ran away. The two other groups, rushing up to the sound of the > shooting, were only able to recover his bloodied corpse and bring it back to > Hanoi.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 126‚Äì7 Garnier's death effectively ended the first French adventure in Tonkin. The French government disavowed Garnier's adventure and hastened to conclude a peace settlement with the Vietnamese, abandoning most of its claims in Tonkin.  Achievement  Garnier's chief fame rests on the fact that he both conceived the idea of exploring the Mekong and carried out the larger portion of the work. During the French colonial period he was also honoured for his feats of arms in Tonkin, which paved the way for the eventual French conquest of Tonkin in the 1880s.  Commemoration  In 1883, nine years after Francis Garnier's death, the French naval officer Henri Rivi√®re was also killed by the Black Flags in Tonkin, in remarkably similar circumstances. Garnier and Rivi√®re were honoured during the French colonial period as the two pre-eminent French martyrs of the conquest of Tonkin. In 1884, during the Sino-French War, two gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla were named after the two men. During the siege of Tuy√™n Quang (November 1884‚ÄìMarch 1885), Liu Yung-fu's Black Flags, who formed part of the besieging Chinese army, taunted the men of the French garrison by chanting the names of their two most famous victims: 'Garnier! Rivi√®re! Garnier! Rivi√®re!'De Lonlay, 114 In 1943, French Indochina issued a postage stamp commemorating Garnier. * A warship was named after him during World War II but was scuttled after a fight with the Japanese, near the Cambodian town of Krati√©. * In 1973 a new ship, , was built.

Lines of the same color are \\"parallel\\". The centre of the figure is not a \\"point\\" of this affine plane, hence the two green \\"lines\\" don't \\"intersect\\". A finite geometry is any geometric system that has only a finite number of points. The familiar Euclidean geometry is not finite, because a Euclidean line contains infinitely many points. A geometry based on the graphics displayed on a computer screen, where the pixels are considered to be the points, would be a finite geometry. While there are many systems that could be called finite geometries, attention is mostly paid to the finite projective and affine spaces because of their regularity and simplicity. Other significant types of finite geometry are finite M√∂bius or inversive planes and Laguerre planes, which are examples of a general type called Benz planes, and their higher- dimensional analogs such as higher finite inversive geometries. Finite geometries may be constructed via linear algebra, starting from vector spaces over a finite field; the affine and projective planes so constructed are called Galois geometries. Finite geometries can also be defined purely axiomatically. Most common finite geometries are Galois geometries, since any finite projective space of dimension three or greater is isomorphic to a projective space over a finite field (that is, the projectivization of a vector space over a finite field). However, dimension two has affine and projective planes that are not isomorphic to Galois geometries, namely the non-Desarguesian planes. Similar results hold for other kinds of finite geometries. Finite planes Finite affine plane of order 3, containing 9 points and 12 lines. The following remarks apply only to finite planes. There are two main kinds of finite plane geometry: affine and projective. In an affine plane, the normal sense of parallel lines applies. In a projective plane, by contrast, any two lines intersect at a unique point, so parallel lines do not exist. Both finite affine plane geometry and finite projective plane geometry may be described by fairly simple axioms. = Finite affine planes = An affine plane geometry is a nonempty set X (whose elements are called \\"points\\"), along with a nonempty collection L of subsets of X (whose elements are called \\"lines\\"), such that: # For every two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both points. # Playfair's axiom: Given a line \\\\ell and a point p not on \\\\ell, there exists exactly one line \\\\ell' containing p such that \\\\ell \\\\cap \\\\ell' = \\\\varnothing. # There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line. The last axiom ensures that the geometry is not trivial (either empty or too simple to be of interest, such as a single line with an arbitrary number of points on it), while the first two specify the nature of the geometry. The simplest affine plane contains only four points; it is called the affine plane of order 2. (The order of an affine plane is the number of points on any line, see below.) Since no three are collinear, any pair of points determines a unique line, and so this plane contains six lines. It corresponds to a tetrahedron where non- intersecting edges are considered \\"parallel\\", or a square where not only opposite sides, but also diagonals are considered \\"parallel\\". More generally, a finite affine plane of order n has n2 points and lines; each line contains n points, and each point is on lines. The affine plane of order 3 is known as the Hesse configuration. = Finite projective planes = A projective plane geometry is a nonempty set X (whose elements are called \\"points\\"), along with a nonempty collection L of subsets of X (whose elements are called \\"lines\\"), such that: # For every two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both points. # The intersection of any two distinct lines contains exactly one point. # There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line. Duality in the Fano plane: Each point corresponds to a line and vice versa. An examination of the first two axioms shows that they are nearly identical, except that the roles of points and lines have been interchanged. This suggests the principle of duality for projective plane geometries, meaning that any true statement valid in all these geometries remains true if we exchange points for lines and lines for points. The smallest geometry satisfying all three axioms contains seven points. In this simplest of the projective planes, there are also seven lines; each point is on three lines, and each line contains three points. The Fano plane This particular projective plane is sometimes called the Fano plane. If any of the lines is removed from the plane, along with the points on that line, the resulting geometry is the affine plane of order 2. The Fano plane is called the projective plane of order 2 because it is unique (up to isomorphism). In general, the projective plane of order n has n2 + n + 1 points and the same number of lines; each line contains n + 1 points, and each point is on n + 1 lines. A permutation of the Fano plane's seven points that carries collinear points (points on the same line) to collinear points is called a collineation of the plane. The full collineation group is of order 168 and is isomorphic to the group PSL(2,7) ‚âà PSL(3,2), which in this special case is also isomorphic to the general linear group . = Order of planes = A finite plane of order n is one such that each line has n points (for an affine plane), or such that each line has n + 1 points (for a projective plane). One major open question in finite geometry is: :Is the order of a finite plane always a prime power? This is conjectured to be true. Affine and projective planes of order n exist whenever n is a prime power (a prime number raised to a positive integer exponent), by using affine and projective planes over the finite field with elements. Planes not derived from finite fields also exist (e.g. for n=9), but all known examples have order a prime power. The best general result to date is the Bruck‚ÄìRyser theorem of 1949, which states: :If n is a positive integer of the form or and n is not equal to the sum of two integer squares, then n does not occur as the order of a finite plane. The smallest integer that is not a prime power and not covered by the Bruck‚ÄìRyser theorem is 10; 10 is of the form , but it is equal to the sum of squares . The non-existence of a finite plane of order 10 was proven in a computer-assisted proof that finished in 1989 ‚Äì see for details. The next smallest number to consider is 12, for which neither a positive nor a negative result has been proved. =History= Individual examples can be found in the work of Thomas Penyngton Kirkman (1847) and the systematic development of finite projective geometry given by von Staudt (1856). The first axiomatic treatment of finite projective geometry was developed by the Italian mathematician Gino Fano. In his work on proving the independence of the set of axioms for projective n-space that he developed, he considered a finite three dimensional space with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes (see diagram), in which each line had only three points on it. Finite Geometries? an AMS Featured Column In 1906 Oswald Veblen and W. H. Bussey described projective geometry using homogeneous coordinates with entries from the Galois field GF(q). When n + 1 coordinates are used, the n-dimensional finite geometry is denoted PG(n, q).Oswald Veblen (1906) Finite Projective Geometries, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 7: 241‚Äì59 It arises in synthetic geometry and has an associated transformation group. Finite spaces of 3 or more dimensions For some important differences between finite plane geometry and the geometry of higher- dimensional finite spaces, see axiomatic projective space. For a discussion of higher-dimensional finite spaces in general, see, for instance, the works of J.W.P. Hirschfeld. The study of these higher-dimensional spaces () has many important applications in advanced mathematical theories. =Axiomatic definition= A projective space S can be defined axiomatically as a set P (the set of points), together with a set L of subsets of P (the set of lines), satisfying these axioms : * Each two distinct points p and q are in exactly one line. * Veblen's axiom:also referred to as the Veblen‚ÄìYoung axiom and mistakenly as the axiom of Pasch . Pasch was concerned with real projective space and was attempting to introduce order, which is not a concern of the Veblen‚ÄìYoung axiom. If a, b, c, d are distinct points and the lines through ab and cd meet, then so do the lines through ac and bd. * Any line has at least 3 points on it. The last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can be written as a disjoint union of projective spaces together with 2-point lines joining any two points in distinct projective spaces. More abstractly, it can be defined as an incidence structure consisting of a set P of points, a set L of lines, and an incidence relation I stating which points lie on which lines. Obtaining a finite projective space requires one more axiom: * The set of points P is a finite set. In any finite projective space, each line contains the same number of points and the order of the space is defined as one less than this common number. A subspace of the projective space is a subset X, such that any line containing two points of X is a subset of X (that is, completely contained in X). The full space and the empty space are always subspaces. The geometric dimension of the space is said to be n if that is the largest number for which there is a strictly ascending chain of subspaces of this form: : \\\\varnothing = X_{-1} \\\\subset X_{0}\\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset X_{n} = P . =Algebraic construction= A standard algebraic construction of systems satisfies these axioms. For a division ring D construct an -dimensional vector space over D (vector space dimension is the number of elements in a basis). Let P be the 1-dimensional (single generator) subspaces and L the 2-dimensional (two independent generators) subspaces (closed under vector addition) of this vector space. Incidence is containment. If D is finite then it must be a finite field GF(q), since by Wedderburn's little theorem all finite division rings are fields. In this case, this construction produces a finite projective space. Furthermore, if the geometric dimension of a projective space is at least three then there is a division ring from which the space can be constructed in this manner. Consequently, all finite projective spaces of geometric dimension at least three are defined over finite fields. A finite projective space defined over such a finite field has points on a line, so the two concepts of order coincide. Such a finite projective space is denoted by , where PG stands for projective geometry, n is the geometric dimension of the geometry and q is the size (order) of the finite field used to construct the geometry. In general, the number of k-dimensional subspaces of is given by the product:, where the formula is given, in terms of vector space dimension, by . : {{n+1} \\\\choose {k+1}}_q = \\\\prod_{i=0}^k \\\\frac{q^{n+1-i}-1}{q^{i+1}-1}, which is a Gaussian binomial coefficient, a q analogue of a binomial coefficient. =Classification of finite projective spaces by geometric dimension= *Dimension 0 (no lines): The space is a single point and is so degenerate that it is usually ignored. *Dimension 1 (exactly one line): All points lie on the unique line, called a projective line. *Dimension 2: There are at least 2 lines, and any two lines meet. A projective space for is a projective plane. These are much harder to classify, as not all of them are isomorphic with a . The Desarguesian planes (those that are isomorphic with a ) satisfy Desargues's theorem and are projective planes over finite fields, but there are many non-Desarguesian planes. *Dimension at least 3: Two non- intersecting lines exist. The Veblen‚ÄìYoung theorem states in the finite case that every projective space of geometric dimension is isomorphic with a , the n-dimensional projective space over some finite field GF(q). =The smallest projective three-space= PG(3,2) but not all the lines are drawn The smallest 3-dimensional projective space is over the field GF(2) and is denoted by PG(3,2). It has 15 points, 35 lines, and 15 planes. Each plane contains 7 points and 7 lines. Each line contains 3 points. As geometries, these planes are isomorphic to the Fano plane. Square model of Fano 3-space Every point is contained in 7 lines. Every pair of distinct points are contained in exactly one line and every pair of distinct planes intersects in exactly one line. In 1892, Gino Fano was the first to consider such a finite geometry. Kirkman's schoolgirl problem PG(3,2) arises as the background for a solution of Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, which states: \\"Fifteen schoolgirls walk each day in five groups of three. Arrange the girls‚Äô walk for a week so that in that time, each pair of girls walks together in a group just once.\\" There are 35 different combinations for the girls to walk together. There are also 7 days of the week, and 3 girls in each group. Two of the seven non- isomorphic solutions to this problem can be stated in terms of structures in the Fano 3-space, PG(3,2), known as packings. A spread of a projective space is a partition of its points into disjoint lines, and a packing is a partition of the lines into disjoint spreads. In PG(3,2), a spread would be a partition of the 15 points into 5 disjoint lines (with 3 points on each line), thus corresponding to the arrangement of schoolgirls on a particular day. A packing of PG(3,2) consists of seven disjoint spreads and so corresponds to a full week of arrangements.

He was born in the San Juan area of R√≠o Piedras, but because of the closeness of his birthplace to Caguas, he often trained at the Bairoa Gym in Caguas. His training base, however, was the Caimito Gym. A former Lineal and WBA Bantamweight champion, Solis is the only world champion in a family that produced two other world-class boxers: brother Enrique was outpointed by WBA Featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza in 1978, and brother Rafael was knocked out in five rounds by WBC Super featherweight champion H√©ctor Camacho in 1983. Professional boxing career Solis began his professional boxing career in 1975, outpointing Ray Negron in four on 11 November. He won his first five fights in Puerto Rico, and then had his first international fight in December 1975, when he beat Juan G√≥mez in St. Maarten by a knockout in round two. On 12 February 1978, he met fringe contender Nivio Nolasco, outpointing him over ten rounds, and travelled to the Dominican Republic, where on 15 March he outpointed Leopoldo Frias also in ten rounds. With a record of 12-0 and 5 knockouts, he returned to the Dominican Republic, where he challenged Julio Soto Solano on 16 October for the \\"Latin American Bantamweight title\\", winning the regional belt by outpointing Solano over 12 rounds. World bantamweight championship In 1979, he won four fights, including one over Julio C. Saba knocked out in eight rounds in Buenos Aires. Solis continued on his travels in 1980. He retained the Latin American title with a 12th-round knockout of future world title challenger Edgar Roman in Venezuela, won a fight in South Africa, and challenged the Lineal and WBA Bantamweight champion Jorge Lujan in Miami on 29 August, winning on points. For his first defense, Solis returned to Miami, but he lost the belt and his undefeated record to Jeff Chandler on November 14 when he was knocked out in the fourteenth round. After beginning 1981 with a win, he met Chandler again on 25 July, at Atlantic City, New Jersey. This time Chandler did the job in half the time, knocking out Solis in the seventh round. His next fight, with Kiko Bejines (later to die in a boxing related accident) in Los Angeles, also resulted in a seventh-round knockout defeat. Solis started 1982 by winning two fights in San Juan and another one in Chile. By 1983, he was a popular performer in televised fights, often held in small Puerto Rican cities. He won four fights in Puerto Rico that year, and drew in Panama with the Number One ranked Super bantamweight, Bernardo Checa. In 1984, he won three fights, including a ten-round decision over future world champion Kenny Mitchell on the 8 December undercard of the Azumah Nelson - Wilfredo G√≥mez WBC Featherweight championship bout in San Juan. In 1985, Solis fought only once, outpointing David Campo. He began 1986 by losing on points to Mike Ayala over ten rounds on 2 March in San Antonio. Solis and his handlers felt he had been robbed of a victory by the judges in this fight, feeling that Solis had done enough to win. They filed a complaint with the Texas state athletic commission, but in vain, as the officials reviewed a tape of the fight and decided the result should stand. Solis fought on from this point, but he only won six of his last fifteen bouts before retiring in 1992. True to his globe-trotting style, only two of those bouts were in Puerto Rico, and he visited Italy, South Korea, South Africa once again, Miami and various American states.

The original version of the character first appeared in Adventure Comics #428 (cover-dated July 1973). Fictional character biographies =Susan Linden- Thorne= Alba Garcia as Black Orchid in Justice League Dark #11 (September 2012). Art by Mikel Jan√≠n. Although she has a number of superpowers (including flight, super-strength, and invulnerability to bullets) her main ability is a mastery of disguise. She often spends an entire investigation impersonating a seemingly insignificant female background character (e.g. a maid, a secretary, someone's girlfriend) and the other characters only discover her involvement at the end of the story upon finding the bound and gagged woman she impersonated, and an abandoned disguise with her calling card, a black orchid. After appearing in Adventure Comics #'s 428‚Äì430, a backup feature starring the character ran in The Phantom Stranger #31‚Äì32, 35‚Äì36, and 38‚Äì41 (1974‚Äì1976). Black Orchid subsequently appeared sporadically, including occasional cameos in the Crisis on Infinite Earths 12-issue limited series, Blue Devil Annual #1, Deadshot #1, and Invasion! #2. She had a slightly larger role in Suicide Squad as a member of the team in issues #4, 7, 11‚Äì12, and 22 (1987‚Äì1988). She also had an appearance in the non-continuity children's comic book Super Friends #31. While Adventure Comics #428 proclaimed on its cover that it was an \\"origin issue,\\" almost no background on the character was given, not even her name. Until Neil Gaiman described her origin, the character was known for her lack of an origin. Instead, writers teased the audience with several possible origins, all refuted. In Adventure Comics #429, Barry DeMorte hypothesizes that either yoga master Lucinda \\"Cindy\\" Harper or anti-gravity specialist Daphne Wingate is Black Orchid, and he kidnaps both. When Black Orchid comes to the rescue, he learns otherwise. In The Phantom Stranger #38, writer Michael Fleisher posited racecar driver Ronnie Kuhn as a possible secret identity for Black Orchid. In the next issue, Kuhn is revealed to be simply an admirer of Black Orchid, who is soon seduced into \\"The Black Orchid Legion\\" (molecular chemist Karen Jensen, astrophysicist Stefanie Tower, Olympic gymnast and acrobat Barbie Henderson, criminologist Janet Grant, and psychologist and martial artist Lisa Patrick), a group of criminals who developed suits that would mimic Black Orchid's powers, because of her father's status as president of the World Bank, claiming that they are helping her to protect it from Communists. They bind her to the safe door, which they have set with explosives. Black Orchid rescues her, and when the police arrest the Legion, one mistakes Kuhn for Black Orchid, claiming to \\"know how it is with you super-heroes.\\"The Phantom Stranger (vol. 2) #40‚Äì41 Although Super Friends was never considered canon, writer E. Nelson Bridwell made it fit, anyway. His story had Lisa Patrick purchase a large chunk of kryptonite on the black market, convinced that Black Orchid is a Kryptonian. Patrick tries to lure her to the meteorite display at the Gotham City Museum of Natural History, attracting the Justice League. Black Orchid places a force field around the kryptonite to protect Superman, but the force field harms her instead, further convincing Patrick that she is Kryptonian, not noting the lack of effect on Superman. Superman takes the kryptonite into space, and Black Orchid follows him to take it as a brief hand-off so that the fragments will not kill him. When she survives the explosion, Superman inquires where she is from and how she acquired her powers. She answers, \\"Earth\\".Super Friends #31 In Blue Devil Annual #1, the usually reliable Madame Xanadu and Phantom Stranger provide competing origins for Black Orchid. Xanadu identifies her as Madeleine Moorcock, and her origin is a parody of Daredevil, while the Stranger identifies her as Paula Porter, whose origin parodies Spider-Man. Her appearances as an auxiliary member of the Suicide Squad are generally limited to brief rescues or bits of spying. Perhaps the most revealing issue is #19, in which she does not actually appear, but a black orchid is found as evidence that she has been tapping into Task Force X's mainframe computer, which arouses suspicion, as she is there as support rather than as a rehabilitated criminal. Her disappearance was eventually noted by the Squad. In 1988, the character was relaunched in the three-issue miniseries Black Orchid, written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Dave McKean. The miniseries fleshed out the character considerably, providing an origin story which explained how and why she became known as Black Orchid. It also gave the character a civilian name in her origin sequence, Susan Linden-Thorne. Instead of being a normal super- powered human (or metahuman in the DC Universe), her background was changed to be that of a human-plant hybrid with ties to the Green. In this way she became related with other such human-plant hybrids as the Swamp Thing, Floronic Man, and Poison Ivy. After the miniseries concluded, DC Comics intended to put Black Orchid in Suicide Squad as a comic relief character, but replaced her with Poison Ivy after Gaiman's objections. Gaiman had also wanted to write a sequel to that series called Black Orchard, an \\"ecological Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", but it never materialized because he didn't want to make it without Dave McKean or at least an artist he liked as much.\\"Interview With Neil Gaiman, 1989\\" Susan Linden had been killed by an abusive husband named Carl Thorne, whom she met while a croupier in Monaco. She had been a teenage crush of botanist Philip Sylvain, who later became a colleague to Pamela Isley, Alec (Swamp Thing) Holland and Linda Holland. When Thorne became abusive, she retreated to Sylvain, who cared for her until Thorne succeeded in killing her. Sylvain used Linden's DNA as the source for plant/human hybrids, and kept an entire greenhouse full of them. While working with the Suicide Squad, Flo Crowley caught Black Orchid, or rather her calling card, after she accessed Task Force X's mainframes.Suicide Squad #19 She had been attempting to infiltrate Lexcorp, but her ruse was discovered. She had been masquerading as a secretary, but her wig and mask were removed to reveal her in her classic costume. She was bound to a chair inside a burning building. Black Orchid undid her bindings but died of smoke inhalation before she could escape. Her unrecognizable corpse was determined to be plant material by the fire department. Linden's consciousness was again killed by Thorne, this time a plant that merely thought that she was Linden.Black Orchid #1 Thorne destroyed the greenhouse and killed Sylvain, leaving only two surviving hybrids.Black Orchid #2 Thorne pursued the survivors to Brazil. A squad, sent by Lex Luthor to capture the hybrids, kills Thorne in self-defense. The survivors, enamored by Black Orchid, bury Thorne and leave.Black Orchid #3 =Flora Black= The surviving Black Orchids, both having the consciousness and limited memories of Linden, become as mother and daughter, one being significantly smaller and younger than the other, and although the younger is initially more aware of Linden's memories, these swiftly degenerate. The elder goes under the alias of Flora Black to meet with Sherilyn Sommers, her closest friend. An ongoing Black Orchid series, published under the newly created Vertigo imprint, featuring the new Black Orchid, ran for 22 issues from 1993 to 1995. Written by Dick Foreman, it saw the second version of the character use pheromone manipulation as mind control to become a femme fatale, breaking and marrying millionaire Elliot Weems to claim his fortune and company business as her own. She then became the series' major villain in the closing story arc, before perishing in the final issue. Her companion, a child version of Black Orchid heretofore nicknamed \\"Suzy\\", had matured over the course of the series, taking up the mantle of the Black Orchid as a young adult. Suzy features prominently in The Black Orchid Annual #1, part 2 of Vertigo's Children's Crusade crossover. The Annual was published between issues #4 and #5 of the ongoing series.The Continuity Pages: Swamp Thing, Hellblazer and Black Orchid Accessed January 11, 2008 =Suzy= The grown-up Suzy is identical to her \\"sister\\" and carries on the tradition in both the DC Universe and related Vertigo titles. She has appeared in four event titles: 1999's Totems one-shot, 2001's Justice Leagues limited series, 2005's Day of Vengeance limited series, and 2006's Infinite Crisis limited series. She is at present an ally of the Shadowpact and the Birds of Prey. An unidentified Black Orchid recently appeared in the weekly Trinity series, as a member of an alternate universe Justice League. =Alba Garcia= A new Black Orchid resembling the original (with a slightly modernized costume) appears in The New 52, the 2011 reboot of DC's continuity. In this new timeline, she is assigned to the Justice League Dark by Steve Trevor and is an agent of ARGUS. Her name has been revealed to be Alba Garcia, formerly an army private whose arms had been amputated.Justice League Dark #14 She transforms into a monstrous purple Swamp Thing-like creature during her time in a magical alternate dimension where each member of the Justice League Dark suffers differently due to the effects of the new environment. The transformation possibly suggests that she is linked to an elemental force analogous to \\"the Green\\", considering Swamp Thing's physical form manifests due to his connection to the Green. Powers and abilities The first Black Orchid had super strength, durability, flight, and was a master of disguise. The second and third Black Orchids had super strength, flight, and could absorb nutrients from the air. The second version could also generate seductive pheromones and was seen to change her eye pigmentation, commenting that skin, hair, and eye color were easy for adjust (presumably linking back to her predecessors' disguise ability). The New 52 version of the character seemingly possesses all of these abilities, as well as the power to change shape at will, providing a modern explanation for the elaborate disguises of the original. Her manipulation of the Red and the Green allow her to change form, and stretch her body to extreme lengths. Other versions =JLA: The Nail= In the Elseworlds story JLA: The Nail, a captive Black Orchid makes an appearance in Professor Hamilton's Cadmus Labs.JLA: The Nail #3 In the sequel Another Nail, she appears alongside Power Girl and Star Sapphire as part of a team sent to steal Amazo from the Metal Men, later revealed to be on the orders of Niles Caulder and Dinah Lance. =Flashpoint= The original Black Orchid briefly appears in the 2011 limited series Flashpoint: Secret Seven. She is a member of the original Secret Seven who had been killed years earlier. Black Orchid apparently returns from the dead to contact her former teammate Shade, the Changing Man, but is ultimately revealed to be a monster who had merely assumed Orchid's form.Flashpoint: Secret Seven #1 In other media =Television= * Black Orchid appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Mask of Matches Malone!\\".

Writer Mary Hope and painter Rachel Morrow scratch out a meager existence on a farm (called Amarna) on the Oregon coast. They are determined to collect and preserve for a new civilization all the great books of western culture. Farther down the coast lives the Arkites, a fundamentalist group that denies all knowledge not found in the Bible. After a plague strikes the Arkites Mary agrees to take in a few survivors on the condition that she be allowed to educate the children as she sees fit\\". From the back cover of the backinprint.com paperback edition: A Gift Upon the Shore is a lyrical, haunting story of two women, an artist and a writer, who survive pandemic, the collapse of civilization, and a deadly nuclear winter. Driven by rich and fully drawn characters, this is a powerful, compelling story of a friendship that endures the devastation and finds a purpose for survival: to preserve the books, the shards of a lost golden age, as a gift to an unknowable posterity. Yet this gift is threatened by the only other survivors the women encounter, the people of the Ark, who believe that except for the Bible, all books are evil. A Gift Upon the Shore is a story about remaining human under the worst of conditions, and the humanizing influence of books and art and love.

It is a planned town with a population of 25,549 as of February 2010. With all the buildings owned by the government, development is strictly controlled and carefully planned. Overview Taipei, capital of the Republic of China (Taiwan), was also the capital of Taiwan Province from September 1945 until 1956. Ground was broken on the village on 4 November 1955, and branches of the government began moving in 5 July 1956. The provincial government held its first meeting at Zhongxing New Village on 27 November 1957, and the provincial administration building began use on 1 July 1957. The People's Republic of China (PRC), which has ruled the Chinese mainland since 1949, who also claimed the island of Taiwan, does not recognize the move of the provincial government from Taipei to Zhongxing New Village as legitimate. Thus, the PRC publishes Taipei as the claimed provincial capital on its official maps. Research development There are plans for an industrial innovation park to be set up in the planned zone in the city; domestic research institutes have been invited to open innovation and incubation centers there. In addition, a market intelligence technology center is also planned for the development of green intelligence mobile technologies through cloud computing. The park is scheduled to begin construction after the completion of an environmental impact assessment in 2011. It is estimated to cost NT$10.7 billion (US$367.5 million) to construct, and will house 250 research and development units and provide 13,000 new jobs. No manufacturing activities will be conducted at the park, which will instead focus on emerging and advanced industrial technology.

It is the least typical of Wyndham's major novels, but regarded by some as his best. An early manuscript version was entitled Time for a Change. The novel was adapted for BBC radio by Barbara Clegg in 1982, with a further adaptation by Jane Rogers in 2012. It was also adapted for the theatre by playwright David Harrower in 1999. Plot summary The inhabitants of post-apocalypse Labrador have vague knowledge of the \\"Old People\\", a technologically advanced civilization they believe was destroyed when God sent \\"Tribulation\\" to the world to punish their forebears' sins. The inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist Christianity; they believe that to follow God's word and prevent another Tribulation, they must preserve absolute normality among the surviving humans, plants and animals, and therefore practice eugenics. Humans with even minor mutations are considered blasphemies and either killed or sterilized and banished to the Fringes, a lawless and untamed area rife with animal and plant mutations, and suggested to be contaminated with radiation. Arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of over- sized horses. These are deemed by the government to be legitimate breeds, either preexisting or achieved through conventional breeding. The government's position is considered both cynical and heretical by many of the orthodox frontier community, and it is suggested that they support the usage of these animals for the sole purpose of their greater efficiency. The inland rural settlement of Waknuk is a frontier farming community, populated with hardy and pious individuals, and is where the story mainly takes place. David Strorm, the son of Waknuk's most religious man, Joseph Strorm, has dreams of large cities and \\"horseless carts\\", although he does not understand why he has these dreams or what they mean, and is cautious about mentioning it to his father, lest he raise suspicion that he's a mutant. He makes friends with Sophie, a girl who secretly has six toes on one of her feet. Later, Sophie's family attempts to escape from the reprisals (ceremonies in which blasphemies are sterilized) when, having walked ashore from swimming, her wet footprints are observed by a local boy. David and other children in Waknuk hide their own form of mutation: telepathy. David's Uncle Axel, who knew about the group from talking to David about his telepathy when he was young, advises David and protects them from persecution. He advises David on the wisdom of hiding his and the other's ability, and later kills the husband of one of the group's members who was planning to blackmail the telepaths. David's younger sister Petra demonstrates exceptionally strong telepathic talent when her horse is attacked by a wildcat - she calls to all the telepaths for help across the entire Waknuk area, and stuns those closest to her. That leads to suspicion from the locals, and Uncle Axel warns the group, via David, that the Inspectors are beginning to investigate them. Later, two telepaths, Katherine and Sally, are captured and tortured for information, while David, his cousin Rosalind, and Petra escape to the Fringes. A group of men from various districts band together to track and capture the telepaths - unknown to the Norms, the posse includes a telepath named Michael who keeps the escaping group informed of the trackers' progress. Later, with Petra's strong telepathic abilities, they contact a society with telepaths in a different country they mistakenly refer to as \\"Sealand\\" (New Zealand). With the help of Sophie, who is now living in the Fringes, they escape the hunters and are rescued by a Sealand expedition. Unfortunately, they do not have enough fuel to take the craft back to Waknuk to pick up Rachel, the lone remaining Waknuk telepath, so they continue to Sealand. Michael vows to return to Waknuk to rescue Rachel, and join them in Sealand however they can. Tribulation Though the nature of \\"Tribulation\\" is not explicitly stated, it is implied that it was a nuclear holocaust, both by the mutations and by the stories of sailors who report blackened, glassy wastes to the south-west where the remains of faintly glowing cities can be seen (presumably the east coast of the US). Sailors venturing too close to these ruins experience symptoms consistent with radiation sickness. A woman from Sealand, a character with evident knowledge of the Old People's technology, mentions \\"the power of gods in the hands of children\\", referring to the nuclear capabilities of world power which were led by incompetent political leaders. Major characters *David Strorm is the narrator of the story. David is one of a small group of youngsters who can communicate with each other via telepathy. However, their community's theological prejudice against anyone who is abnormal means he and the others must keep their abilities carefully hidden. David and Rosalind's love for each other is kept secret from their parents because of a bitter feud between their families. *Sophie Wender is a young girl born with six toes on one of her feet. Sophie lives with her parents in an isolated cottage somewhere north-west of Waknuk, her deviation from the \\"norm\\" keeps her from associating with other children. She befriends David after he discovers her secret but promises not to reveal it. *Joseph Strorm is the father of David and Petra. He is a domineering personality, deeply religious, and unyielding on the subject of mutations and blasphemy, even punishing David severely for an unintentionally blasphemous remark about \\"needing an extra hand\\" to apply a bandage. *Uncle Axel is a widely travelled former sailor, open-minded and willing to question conventional religious precepts. Upon discovering David's telepathy, he counsels caution and extracts a promise that David take great care not to allow others to learn of his mutation. *Petra Strorm is the youngest of the Strorm children. The group of telepaths discovers that her ability is extraordinarily strong and difficult to resist, placing the group at greater risk of discovery. *Rosalind Morton is David's closest friend among the group of telepaths. They become more of a couple later on in the book. She lives on a neighbouring farm and is David's half cousin. *The Sealand woman and her people are from a more technologically advanced society where telepathic ability, while not ubiquitous, is far more common and is accepted, promoted and studied. The woman calls her country \\"Zealand\\", but the telepaths (having had only second-hand contact through Petra) initially believe it is spelled \\"Sealand\\" instead. *Michael is the most objective, perceptive and decisive of the telepaths, the best educated, and in many ways plays a leading role in the group despite his physical absence from events in the story. His telepathic abilities remain secret, and during the pursuit into the Fringes he joins the leading posse to give updates and warnings to David, Rosalind and Petra as they flee. *Rachel is the last remaining telepath in Waknuk after David, Rosalind and Petra depart to Zealand. As her own elder sister who was also a telepath had committed suicide earlier in the book, her possible fate of being left alone whilst the others depart, carries even greater pathos. As an act of heroism, commitment and love, Michael remains behind with Rachel when they find out that the aircraft bringing the four of the telepaths to Zealand does not have enough fuel to also collect Rachel from Waknuk and get home again. He declares the intention to find some other way to come to Zealand with Rachel at some future time. Allusions to actual geography The inland village of Waknuk (Wabush) is in southwestern Labrador. Labrador has become a much warmer place in the fictional future, with large tracts of arable land. Rigo (Rigolet) is the capital of Labrador and the fictional government in the book, a fairly large river town near the east coast. The port of Lark (Lark Harbour) is mentioned as a way-point on the west coast of the island of Newf (Newfoundland) where sailors may obtain provisions. A large island to the north-east (Greenland) is rumoured to be inhabited by an amazonian people with bizarre habits. Northern islands are described as being cold and inhabited chiefly by birds and sea animals (islands of Nunavut). Uncle Axel, a former sailor, has travelled far to the south of Labrador, and from a distance seen the \\"Black Coasts\\", where there are areas with what look like ruins of the old civilisation. He also recounts second-hand tales of South American primates living in forests. Later, the existence of geographic areas far less affected by the nuclear exchange and fallout are established, particularly Sealand (New Zealand), which is home to a socially and technologically advanced society where telepathy not only is the norm, but is encouraged and developed as a survival advantage. Literary significance Although stylistically The Chrysalids does not differ markedly from Wyndham's other novels, the subject matter is rather different. While most are set against a mid-twentieth-century English middle-class background, The Chrysalids is set in a future society which is described in some detail. Unlike most of his novels, it is also a coming-of-age story. It was written after The Kraken Wakes and before The Midwich Cuckoos. Critical response J. Francis McComas, reviewing the American release for The New York Times, declared that the \\"outstanding success\\" of the novel lay in Wyndham's \\"creation of humanly understandable characters that are, after all, something more and less than human\\" and concluded that the novel \\"will be well noted and long remembered\\".\\"Spaceman's Realm\\", The New York Times Book Review, 10 July 1955, p. 15 The critic and science fiction author Damon Knight wrote that Wyndham \\"failed to realize how good a thing he had. The sixth toe was immensely believable, and sufficient; but Wyndham has dragged in a telepathic mutation on top of it; has made David himself one of the nine child telepaths, and hauled the whole plot away from his carefully built background, into just one more damned chase with a rousing cliche at the end of it ... this error is fatal.\\" SFreviews.net gave a mixed review, stating that \\"The Chrysalids comes heart-wrenchingly close to being John Wyndham's most powerful and profound work\\", but that \\"Wyndham stumbles‚Äîcatastrophically‚Äîat the climax, in a way that actually undermines the story's thematic foundations\\". The novel also got some positive reviews. The Ottawa Citizen judged the novel as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"a top-notch piece of sci-fi that should be enjoyed for generations yet to come\\". The Guardian described it as \\"a remarkably tender story of a post- nuclear childhood\\" and \\"a classic to most of its three generations of readers\\". Hartford Courant reviewer George W. Earley praised it as \\"a compelling story and Mr. Wyndham's best novel to date.\\"\\"Science Fiction\\", The Hartford Courant, 16 October 1955, p. SM22 Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin praised the novel as \\"so skillfully done that the fact that it's not a shiny new idea makes absolutely no difference\\".\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, September 1955, p.91 Anthony Boucher similarly found the novel made \\"something completely fresh\\" out of a familiar theme, commending Wyndham's \\"accumulation of minutely plausible detail\\" and \\"greater depth and maturity than he has shown in previous novels\\".\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, August 1955, p.94. Writing in Astounding, P. Schuyler Miller reported that Wyndham \\"has made the Mutant theme believable in a way that Odd John, Slan and the stories of the Baldies never quite were\\".Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"The Reference Library\\", Astounding Science-Fiction, October 1955, pp. 144‚Äì45. There is critical disagreement regarding whether the intervention of the Sealand culture at the end of the novel should be considered a deus ex machina. Critics have disagreed with Wyndham's implication that two differently evolved species must necessarily fight to the death. Wyndham justifies this in a lengthy speech from the Sealand woman near the end of the novel, but her reasoning seems at odds with the implicit plea for tolerance in the earlier part of the novel. This implication also exists in The Kraken Wakes and The Midwich Cuckoos. Radio adaptations BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour presented an unabridged reading by Geoffrey Wheeler of the novel in ten 15-minute episodes, broadcast daily between 17 and 28 August 1970. The novel was adapted by Barbara Clegg as a single 90-minute drama for BBC Radio 4, directed by Michael Bartlett, and first broadcast on 24 April 1981. The cast includes: * Stephen Garlick ‚Äì David * Amanda Murray ‚Äì Rosalind * Judy Bennett ‚Äì Petra * Spencer Banks ‚Äì Michael/Alan * Philipa Ritchie ‚Äì Katherine * Jenny Lee ‚Äì Rachel * Kathryn Hurlbutt ‚Äì Anne This version was released on CD by BBC Audiobooks in 2007. In popular culture The song \\"Crown of Creation\\" by the American rock band Jefferson Airplane was inspired by the novel. Its title and lyrics are drawn from the text and plot with permission from Wyndham. One example lifted almost verbatim from the text reflects a philosophical explanation by the New Zealand woman: \\"But life is change, that is how it differs from rocks, change is its very nature.\\" This line is rendered in the lyrics as \\"Life is change ‚Äì How it differs from the rocks.\\" The portion of the song that reads: \\"In loyalty to their kind / they cannot tolerate our minds. / In loyalty to our kind / we cannot tolerate their obstruction\\" is from an explanation by the New Zealand woman that asserts the inevitability of conflict between a more advanced species and its less advanced progenitors. (The book's original phrase is \\"they cannot tolerate our rise\\".)

A pioneer of brain surgery, he was the first exclusive neurosurgeon and the first person to describe Cushing's disease. He wrote a biography of William Osler in three volumes. Early life Harvey Cushing was born in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents were Elizabeth Maria \\"Betsey M.\\" Williams and Henry Kirke Cushing,https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf a physician whose ancestors came to Hingham, Massachusetts, as Puritans in the 17th century.Lincoln, Solomon Jr.; Gill, Caleb Jr. History of the Town of Hingham, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, Farmer and Brown, Hingham, 1827. Harvey was the youngest of ten children. =Education= As a child, Cushing attended the Cleveland Manual Training School, which expanded his interest in science and medicine. The school's emphasis on experimental training and a \\"physics-focused\\" approach to education played an important role in influencing Cushing towards a career in medical surgery. The school's manual dexterity training program also contributed to Cushing's future success as a surgeon.Fulton, John. Harvey Cushing A Biography. Springfield, Illinois. 1946. Print. He graduated with an A.B. degree in 1891 from Yale University, where he was a member of Scroll and Key and Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter). He studied medicine at Harvard Medical School and earned his medical degree in 1895. Cushing completed his internship at Massachusetts General Hospital and then did a residency in surgery under the guidance of pioneering surgeon William Stewart Halsted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Career After doing exceptional cerebral surgery abroad under Kocher at Bern and Sherrington at Liverpool, he began private practice in Baltimore. During his time with Kocher, he first encountered the Cushing reflex which describes the relationship between blood pressure and intracranial pressure. At the age of 32, he was made associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and was placed in full charge of cases of surgery of the central nervous system. Yet he found time to write numerous monographs on surgery of the brain and spinal column and to make important contributions to bacteriology. He made (with Kocher) a study of intracerebral pressure and (with Sherrington) contributed much to the localization of the cerebral centers. In Baltimore, he developed the method of operating with local anaesthesia, and his paper on its use in hernia gave him a European reputation. In 1911, he was appointed surgeon-in-chief at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He became a professor of surgery at the Harvard Medical School starting in 1912. In 1913, he was made an honorary F.R.C.S. (London). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914. In 1915, before the Clinical Congress of Surgeons in Boston, he showed the possibility of influencing stature by operating on the pituitary gland. In 1924, Cushing was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. =First World War= Shortly after the entry of the United States into the First World War, Cushing was commissioned as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps on May 5, 1917. He was director of the U.S. base hospital attached to the British Expeditionary Force in France. Cushing also served as the head of a surgical unit in a French military hospital outside of Paris. During his time at the French military hospital, Cushing experimented with the use of electromagnets to extract fragments of metallic missile shrapnel that were lodged severely within the brain. He was mentioned in a dispatch by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in November 1917.Harvard's Military Record during the World War. Harvard Alumni Association. 1921. pg. 238. On June 6, 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was assigned as senior consultant in neurological surgery for the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe. He attained the rank of colonel (O-6) on October 23, 1918. In that capacity, he treated Lieutenant Edward Revere Osler, who was fatally wounded during the third battle of Ypres. Lieutenant Osler was the son of Sir William Osler. Cushing returned to the United States in February 1919 and was discharged on April 9 of the same year. In recognition of his service during the war, Cushing was invested as a Companion of the Bath by the British government. In 1923 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the U.S. Army.Decorations of the United States Army, 1862‚Äì1926. War Department. Office of the Adjutant General. Washington. 1927. pg. 693. =Later career= Cushing authored the Pulitzer prize-winning biography, Life of Sir William Osler (London: Oxford University Press, 1925). From 1933 to 1937, when he retired, he worked at the Yale School of Medicine as Sterling Professor of Neurology. Cushing died on October 7, 1939, in New Haven, Connecticut, from complications of a myocardial infarction. He was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. An autopsy performed on Cushing revealed that his brain harbored a colloid cyst of the third ventricle. =Legacy= In the beginning of the 20th century, Dr. Cushing developed many of the basic surgical techniques for operating on the brain. This established him as one of the foremost leaders and experts in the field. Under his influence neurosurgery became a new and autonomous surgical discipline. Historical marker at Lake View Cemetery, Cleveland * He considerably improved the survival of patients after difficult brain operations for intracranial tumors. * He used X-rays to diagnose brain tumors. * He used electrical stimuli for study of the human sensory cortex. * He played a pivotal role in development of the Bovie electrocautery tool with William T. Bovie, a physicist. * He was the world's leading teacher of neurosurgeons in the first decades of the 20th century. Arguably, Cushing's greatest contribution came with his introduction to North America of blood pressure measurement. Upon visiting colleague Scipione Riva-Rocci, an Italian physician, Cushing was astonished by Riva-Rocci's non-invasive way of measuring intra-arterial pressure. In 1896, Riva-Rocci developed a wall-mounted mercury manometer linked to a balloon-inflated cuff that would measure the pressure needed to compress arterial systolic pressure, i.e. systolic blood pressure measurement. Riva-Rocci's design was based on a more primitive version developed by French physician Pierre Potain. Cushing returned to the US with a sample of Riva- Rocci's sphygmomanometer and blood pressure measurement became a vital sign. The use of the Riva-Rocci sphygmomanometer as a diagnostic tool rapidly spread across the US and western world, a direct contribution by Harvey Cushing. The device's use continued until Russian physician Nikolai Korotkov included diastolic blood pressure measurement in 1905 (after he discovered the famed \\"Korotkoff sounds\\") with his improved sphygmomanometer, which also replaced the mercury manometer with a smaller, round dial manometer.Mangione, Salvatore (2000) Physical Diagnosis Secrets. Hanley & Belfus. Dr. Harvey Cushing, 1908; oil on canvas, Edmund C. Tarbell Cushing's name is commonly associated with his most famous discovery, Cushing's disease. In 1912 he reported in a study an endocrinological syndrome caused by a malfunction of the pituitary gland which he termed \\"polyglandular syndrome.\\" He published his findings in 1932 as \\"The Basophil Adenomas of the Pituitary Body and Their Clinical Manifestations: pituitary Basophilism\\". Reprinted in Cushing was also awarded the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for a book recounting the life of one of the fathers of modern medicine, Sir William Osler. In 1930, Cushing was awarded the Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. As part of the award, he delivered the Lister Memorial Lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in July 1930.The lecture is available at: Neurohypophysial mechanisms from a clinical standpoint Cushing, H., Lancet (Lond.), 1930, ii, 119‚Äì147; 175‚Äì184.For a picture of Cushing's Lister Medal, and an offprint of the lecture, see Harvey Cushing, M.D. Legendary Neurosurgeon ehistorybuff.com (accessed February 17, 2009) Cushing was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1934, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He served as president of the History of Science Society in 1934.The History of Science Society \\"The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society\\" . Retrieved December 4, 2013 Cushing was also a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, nominated at least 38 times. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor. In 1988, the United States Postal Service issued a 45-cent postage stamp in his honor, as part of the Great Americans series.Scott catalog # 2188. Cushing ventricular cannula Cushing developed many surgical instruments that are in use today, most notably Cushing forceps and the Cushing ventricular cannula. The forceps instrument is used to grasp the thick tissues of the scalp during cranial surgery and the cannula is used to enter the brain ventricles for CSF drainage. He also developed a surgical magnet while working with the Harvard Medical Unit in France during World War I to extract shrapnel from the heads of wounded soldiers. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical LibraryDigital Library Collections of the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library at Yale University at Yale University contains extensive collections in the field of medicine and the history of medicine. Cushing's long-time personal secretary, Madeline Stanton, played a major role in organizing his rare book donations, along with those from John F. Fulton and Arnold C. Klebs, to form the library. In 2005, the library released portions of its collection online, including the Peter Parker Collection which consists of a collection of portrait engravings and 83 mid-19th-century oil paintings rendered by artist Lam Qua of Chinese tumor patients, and a biography of Harvey Cushing by John F. Fulton. In 2010, Yale placed on display Cushing's collection of brain specimens. There is also a collection of his papers at the National Library of Medicine.

It was fought in the East Coast region and across the heavily forested central North Island and Bay of Plenty between New Zealand government military forces and followers of spiritual leader Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki. The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti's return to New Zealand after two years of internment on the Chatham Islands, from where he had escaped with almost 200 MƒÅori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti, who had been held without trial on the island for two years, told the government he and his followers wished to be left in peace and would fight only if pursued and attacked. But two weeks after their return to New Zealand, members of Te Kooti's party found themselves being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and MƒÅori volunteers. Te Kooti's force routed them in an ambush, seizing arms, ammunition, food and horses. The engagement was the first in what became a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions by colonial and MƒÅori troops against Te Kooti's dwindling number of warriors. Although initially fighting defensively against pursuing government forces, Te Kooti went on the offensive from November 1868, starting with the Poverty Bay massacre, a well-organised lightning strike against selected European settlers and MƒÅori opponents in the Matawhero district, in which 51 men, women and children were slaughtered and their homes set alight. The attack prompted another vigorous pursuit by government forces, which included a siege at Ngatapa pƒÅ that came to a bloody end: although Te Kooti escaped the siege, MƒÅori forces loyal to the government caught and executed more than 130 of his supporters, as well as prisoners he had earlier seized. Dissatisfied with the MƒÅori King Movement's reluctance to continue its fight against European invasion and confiscation, Te Kooti offered MƒÅori an Old Testament vision of salvation from oppression and a return to a promised land. Wounded three times in battle, he gained a reputation for being immune to death, uttered prophecies that had the appearance of being fulfilled, and developed an image of a mighty warrior riding a white horse, reflecting themes of Christian apocalypticism. In early 1870 Te Kooti gained refuge with T≈´hoe tribes, which consequently suffered a series of damaging raids in which crops and villages were destroyed, as other MƒÅori iwi were lured by the promise of a ¬£5000 reward for Te Kooti's capture. Te Kooti was finally granted sanctuary by the MƒÅori king in 1872 and moved to the King Country, where he continued to develop rituals, texts and prayers of his Ringat≈´ faith. He was formally pardoned by the government in February 1883 and died in 1893. A 2013 Waitangi Tribunal report said the action of Crown forces on the East Coast from 1865 to 1869, the East Coast Wars and the start of Te Kooti's War, resulted in the deaths of proportionately more MƒÅori than in any other district during the New Zealand wars. It condemned the \\"illegal imprisonment\\" on the Chatham Islands of a quarter of the East Coast region's adult male population and said the loss in war of an estimated 43 per cent of the male population, many through acts of \\"lawless brutality\\", was a stain on New Zealand's history and character. Background to war Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki was born about 1832 into the Ngati Maru sub-tribe of the MƒÅori people in Poverty Bay on the south shore of East Cape. By the age of 20 he had become known as one of a group of \\"bother boys\\" or \\"social bandits\\" who led protests over land rights in the Makaraka district near present-day Gisborne, seizing horses and cattle that were being grazed without agreement on MƒÅori land and also plundering settlers' homes, often taking alcohol. The protests were part of a movement to recover occupied land and set up a \\"coalition\\" against the government. Despite his involvement in land politics, Te Kooti stayed clear of the Pai MƒÅrire (Hauhau) religion when it spread to the East Coast in early 1865. He fought with k≈´papa (\\"loyal\\") MƒÅori and government troops against Pai MƒÅrire men, women and children in the week-long siege of Waerenga-a-Hika in October 1865. Te Kooi claimed to have killed two Pai MƒÅrire fighters in the battle, but was accused of being a spy and was arrested after the siege ended. He was released after an investigation, but five months later, on 3 March 1866, he was seized again‚Äîfor reasons now unclear, but probably after accusations by prominent MƒÅori and settlers he had antagonised‚Äîand shipped with several hundred Pai MƒÅrire prisoners and their families to the Chatham Islands for internment without trial. His repeated pleas to be told of what offence he had been accused of, and to be put on trial, were ignored. Prisoners were kept in poor conditions with minimal health care and forced to build roads and barracks and plough cultivations without the aid of animals. In April 1867, a year after their arrival, prisoners were told they would not be repatriated until East Coast land confiscations had been determined. By 1868 the mood of the exiles darkened as they realised there were no plans to return them to New Zealand. On 4 July 1868 Te Kooti led a carefully planned and executed breakout from their internment, overpowering guards, seizing arms and ammunition and commandeering a schooner, the Rifleman, which was moored at the settlement of Waitangi. A total of 298 people‚Äî163 men, 64 women and 71 children‚Äîsailed out of the Chatham Islands, arriving at a secluded cove at Whareongaonga, south of Turanga (modern-day Gisborne), on 9 July. During his time of exile Te Kooti claimed he experienced a series of spiritual revelations that formed the basis of what became known as the Ringat≈´ (\\"Raised hand\\") faith, which was strongly influenced by Old Testament prophecies of divine direction and deliverance from enemies. The apparently unerring fulfillment of Te Kooti's predictions won him the unwavering support of other whakarau (prisoners), and in a letter given to the crew of the Rifleman after arrival in New Zealand, he wrote that Jehovah had intervened to deliver his people from their captivity. The letter also asked that they be left in peace and not be pursued as they made their way to the interior of the North Island. While in the Chathams Te Kooti also learned of the sale of disputed Poverty Bay land in which he held an interest. The transactions involved many of those, both MƒÅori and European settler, whom he later killed in his Poverty Bay campaigns. First engagements Major Reginald Biggs, militia commanding officer and Turanga resident magistrateOn the morning of 12 July 1868, three emissaries arrived at Whareongaonga, passing on a demand from Major Reginald Biggs, Turanga's resident magistrate and militia commanding officer, that they were to surrender their arms and await the government's decision on their future. Te Kooti rejected the demand, declaring he would fight only if he was pursued and attacked. As Biggs scrambled to assemble a force with which to confront Te Kooti at Whareongaonga‚Äîhis militia volunteers, the Mounted Rifles under Captain Charles Westrup, as well as other men from Wairoa and Napier‚Äîthe whakarau, whose fighting force then numbered about 60, set off on 14 July, bound for the King Country, where Te Kooti hoped to challenge the mana of MƒÅori King TƒÅwhiao, who similarly claimed to be the mouthpiece of God. Te Kooti intended to eventually settle in the village of Tauranga, on the eastern shore of Lake Taupo. Biggs, arriving at Whareongaonga and discovering he had missed Te Kooti, marched his 70-strong force to Paparatu, about 40 km away, across a more direct route through open country, intending to cut off his quarry as they crossed the Arai Stream. Biggs left Westrup in command at Paparatu and returned to Turanga to organise a resupply. On the morning of 20 July Te Kooti lured Westrup's force into an ambush, killing two Europeans and forcing a retreat. He seized food, arms and ammunition and 80 horses. Further victories were achieved at Te Koneke on 24 July and then at Ruakitori Gorge, near their new base at the ancient pƒÅ at Puketapu, on 8 August, when Te Kooti's force defeated a column led by the commandant of the Armed Constabulary, Colonel George Whitmore, whom Te Kooti now dubbed \\"Witi koaha\\", or \\"witless\\". The succession of victories attracted more recruits to Te Kooti's party, including Ngati Kohatu chief Korohina Te Rakiroa, who brought with him up to 20 men with government-issued rifles. A crucial bond was also struck between Te Kooti and a high-ranking chief of inland Wairoa, Te Waru Tamatea, a Pai MƒÅrire convert whose son had been taken prisoner in October 1865 during the East Cape War and executed at Biggs' command. Te Waru and fellow chief Nama, survivors of the Waerenga-a- Hika siege, had earlier fought for autonomy for themselves and their people but were now bitterly opposed to the land confiscations that had followed the East Cape War; the failure of the Crown to return their land despite a confiscation settlement a year earlier deepened their resentment. Te Kooti's force was now even stronger, and he was also now committed to aiding Te Waru to achieve utu over his son's death. In Taranaki, meanwhile, government forces were suffering humiliating defeats at the hands of bush warrior and Pai MƒÅrire prophet Riwha Titokowaru. In the wake of their devastating loss at Te Ngutu o Te Manu in early September 1868, Whitmore was sent to Taranaki to assume command, and took the entire east coast Armed Constabulary force with him. The government, eager to free further resources for use against Titokowaru, seized the moment to offer Te Kooti a peace agreement. In mid-October Defence Minister Theodore Haultain directed that a message be sent to Te Kooti at Puketapu stating that if the prisoners surrendered themselves and their arms, no further proceedings would be taken against them and land would be found for them to live on. Historian James Belich commented that the offer was almost certainly genuine and, if accepted, \\"could easily have made Te Kooti's first campaign his last\\". Catholic missionary Father Euloge Reignier was chosen to act as the emissary and negotiator, but was prevented from reaching Te Kooti and instead passed the message on via Pai MƒÅrire warriors. If Te Kooti did receive the offer, he rejected it, suspicious of the government's intentions and aware they planned to storm Puketapu. Unable to move forward or backward without the threat of attack, Te Kooti launched an intensive campaign for MƒÅori support, seeking TƒÅwhiao's assent to enter the King Country and also asking Tuhoe chiefs permission to enter their land. While Tuhoe deferred their decision, TƒÅwhiao sent an outright rejection, warning they would be repelled if they encroached on his territory. Three months after arriving at Puketapu, and by now with a fighting force of about 250‚Äîmany of them drawn from tribes who shared his outrage at spreading land confiscations‚ÄîTe Kooti announced they would return to Turanga. He told his followers: \\"They did not listen. Now we must turn and strike them. Now Turanga shall be given us to dwell in.\\" Poverty Bay massacre, Ngatapa siege On the night of 9 November 1868 Te Kooti led a war party towards Turanga, a district that was home to about 150 European settlers and 500 MƒÅori, in preparation for what became known as the Poverty Bay Massacre or Matawhero Massacre. He emerged about midnight from the Patutahi valley, about 15 km northwest of the European township, accompanied by a 100-man kokiri, or attack party, 60 of whom were mounted. The kokiri was split into two main contingents, with almost all their targets in the farming district of Matawhero, on Turanga's outskirts, where land formerly owned by Te Kooti had been sold and settled during his internment. The first attack force, led by Nama, struck first at the family of Captain James Wilson, killing Wilson, a servant and three of his four children and fatally wounding his wife. The second, and larger, kokiri led by Te Kooti surrounded Biggs' home where he, his wife, their baby and servants were fatally shot, clubbed and bayoneted. The attackers moved on to other homes, slaughtering the families of other settlers who had fought with the militia forces and setting fire to their houses. Many of the killings were followed by the singing of Psalm 63, which concluded: \\"They who seek my life will be destroyed ... they will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.\\" A total of 29 Europeans and part-MƒÅori were killed, as well as 22 MƒÅori, specifically selected by Te Kooti for slaughter for what he perceived as double-dealing or disloyalty over his land during his exile. By the following morning Te Kooti was in control of all land between the Waipaoa River and Makaraka. He remained in the district until 13 November, continuing to take MƒÅori prisoners, before marching his followers and prisoners inland to Oweta pƒÅ, where he took more prisoners and executed four chiefs. When he left the pƒÅ on 19 November, satisfied he had \\"reclaimed\\" Turanga, he was leading 600 people, half of them prisoners, including women and children. The whakerau arrived at Te Karetu, a small pƒÅ at the junction of the Wharekopae and Makaretu rivers, on 22 November. By then they were already being pursued by a force of 340 NgƒÅti Kahungunu raised from Napier and Mahia as well as a contingent from Ngai Tahupo at Muriwai in Poverty Bay. The pursuit force reached Te Karetu on 23 November, but despite having more than double the number of Te Kooti's men‚Äîonly 150 of whom had rifles‚Äîthey were kept at bay until the arrival on 2 December of 180 NgƒÅti Porou fighters led by Ropata Wahawaha. Whitmore, having put on hold his pursuit of Titokowaru on the west coast, arrived in Poverty Bay with 220 Armed Constabulary divisions two days later and joined the campaign. About 40 of Te Kooti's rearguard were killed in the subsequent assault, while Nama was captured, tied up and then dragged repeatedly through fire until he died. It was a hollow victory for Ropata, however, with the pƒÅ found to be almost empty. Te Kooti had moved most of his fighters, along with women, children, food and livestock, to the ancient hilltop fortress of Ngatapa, about 5 km further inland. Ngatapa pƒÅ, on the summit of the hill, scene of the four-day siege in January 1869Ngatapa was a formidable pƒÅ, standing 700 metres above sea level and surrounded by cliffs on three sides and dense bush on the side facing any opposing force. Te Kooti had hastily begun strengthening its defences with trenches, earth banks and palisades, as well as covered walkways connecting the trenches. The interior of the pƒÅ was a maze of rifle pits. Ropata moved his force towards Ngatapa on 3 December, but a day later suffered a blow as NgƒÅti Kahungunu members of his contingent quit the battle and withdrew after a dispute with NgƒÅti Porou fighters, who wished to kill some of the prisoners. The next day, with as few as 150 men, he gained some ground in a rush on the pƒÅ, but was forced to abandon the assault a day later and return to Turanga, short of gunpowder and men. Yet Te Kooti's losses were also mounting: since 23 November he had lost at least 57 men and 60 of his rifles had been captured and many of his Turanga prisoners had also escaped. Desperate for arms and ammunition, Te Kooti led a second lightning raid on Turanga with about 50 men on 12 December, killing four locals but failing to secure the supplies they needed. The raid galvanised Whitmore to renew his campaign against Te Kooti, which he had decided just days earlier to abandon after false reports that Te Kooti had quit Ngatapa and retired inland. His troops, who were already being prepared for a return to Wanganui, were turned around and planning began for a second, better equipped assault on Ngatapa. The 600-man force‚Äî250 Europeans in the Armed Constabulary, 60 Arawa led by European officers and over 300 NgƒÅti Porou led by Ropata and Hotene Porourangi‚Äîmassed at Ngatapa on 31 December and launched the attack the following day, quickly besieging the 300 occupants of the pƒÅ and cutting off their water supply from a hidden spring. Whitmore placed his men on all sides of Ngatapa except one, a high rocky precipice on the north side which was considered far too steep for use as an escape route. Heavy rain fell as the siege continued and when it began to clear on the fourth day, Whitmore commenced a mortar attack, briefly pounding the pƒÅ before halting its use when shrapnel ricocheted off the hill and also went right over it, landing among Hotene's men on the far side. Te Kooti abandoned his outer defences on 5 January after Arawa and NgƒÅti Porou fighters climbed the rock face and kept up heavy fire, while others in Whitmore's force began an offensive sap towards the remaining rampart. Alerted by a woman's cry early on 6 January that there were no men left in the pƒÅ, the attackers entered to find just 20 women and children, most of them prisoners, inside. During the previous night at least 190 occupants of Ngatapa had descended from the unguarded steep rock outcrop, lowering themselves more than 20 metres down the almost perpendicular face on vines woven to form a rope or ladder. NgƒÅti Porou set off in immediate pursuit and flushed out 130 male prisoners from the bush and gorges below. The prisoners were marched up the hill to the pƒÅ's outer parapet, stripped naked, then shot dead. Some were then beheaded. Just 80 prisoners, including 50 women and 16 children‚Äîmost of them emaciated and skeletal‚Äîwere spared execution, with most taken by NgƒÅti Porou as their own prisoners. About 14 male prisoners were kept to be put on trial. While kupapa losses were between 40 and 50 killed and wounded, the defeat for Te Kooti was far more critical, with 136 men, most of his fighting support, killed and 60 of his male prisoners escaping. Retreat to the wilderness Te Kooti and his remaining followers retreated into the Urewera mountains, where he forged alliances with Tuhoe leaders from the Upper Wairoa and Waikeremoana districts who had similarly been dispossessed of their land by the government's punitive confiscation policies, declaring: \\"I take you as my people, and I will be your God.\\" Historian Judith Binney claims Te Kooti offered the Tuhoe chiefs a new form of MƒÅori unity: Yet other Tuhoe chiefs remained wary of an alliance, anticipating the trouble he would bring to the region and its people. It was not long in coming. On 2 March 1869 he launched the first of a new wave of east coast guerrilla raids aimed at gaining arms and ammunition and persuading other MƒÅori groups to join his cause and boost his force of warriors. Te Kooti's men raided both the Whakarae pƒÅ at Ohiwa, near Whakatane, and nearby Hokianga Island, taking all occupants without resistance, before killing a surveyor, Robert Pitcairn. A week later, on 9 March, he besieged a NgƒÅti Pukeko pƒÅ, Rauporoa, on the west bank of the Whakatane River, taking the pa but losing key Taupo ally Wirihana Te Koekoe, who had earlier assured him of sanctuary at the lake. He took more prisoners at Paharakeke, on the Rangitaiki River, then gained more supporters as his forces rode further inland, pursued unsuccessfully by a government force of 450 led by Major William Mair. His new series of raids prompted the evacuation to Auckland of most European women and children in the Bay of Plenty. Early on 10 April 1869, five months to the day after his infamous Poverty Bay raid, he launched another devastating surprise strike, this time on Mohaka, south of Wairoa. Te Kooti's aim was twofold: to seize supplies from the well-equipped kupapa tribes and to exact revenge on NgƒÅti Kahungunu for their war against Te Kooti in 1868. Divided into two kohiri with Tuhoe and NgƒÅti Hineuru fighters prominent among his 150-strong force, they swept through the village of Te Arakinihi at Mohaka, killing 31 men, women and children and seven nearby settlers, some of whom had served in the militia, before moving to their primary targets, Te Huki pƒÅ and the bigger Hiruharama pƒÅ on the coast. Te Huki was besieged overnight before being taken the next morning amid a slaughter of its 26 occupants, most of them women and children. The raid netted Te Kooti enough ammunition to assault Hiruharama, but an attempted siege of the bigger pƒÅ collapsed when outside reinforcements arrived to help the defenders and the cache of ammunition within the pƒÅ exploded, rendering pointless any further battle. Once again Te Kooti retreated to the Tuhoe heartland. Colonel George WhitmoreNews of the March raids near Whakatane had already reached Whitmore in Taranaki, who by then was abandoning his pursuit of Titokowaru. Whitmore and Native Affairs Minister James Richmond resolved to shift the main colonial force to the east coast and by 20 April Whitmore and 600 Armed Constabulary were in Opotoki, preparing for the formidable task of invading the Urewera mountains with the twin aims of capturing Te Kooti and destroying all Tuhoe settlements, and therefore their ability to shelter him. Whitmore organised a three-pronged invasion, all converging on Ruatahuna, the likely centre of resistance: the first from Wairoa in the south and crossing Lake Waikeremoana, led by Lieutenant-Colonel J. L. Herrick, a second under Lieutenant-Colonel St John that would leave Opotiki in the Bay of Plenty and invade from the north, pushing up the Whakatane River; and a third led by Whitmore himself, that would move up the Rangitaki River from Whakatane, building a chain of forts to Tauaroa, and entering the Urewera from the west. The force totaled about 1300 troops: 620 constabulary, 95 militia and 500 kupapa, evenly divided between the three columns‚Äîmore than the entire population of the Urewera. Whitmore's column took the first blood about noon on 6 May, killing six men defending Te Harema pƒÅ and taking 50 prisoners, most of them women and children, who were given to the Arawa contingent. The pƒÅ was looted and later burned. Whitmore continued on to Ruatahuna, rendezvousing with St John on 7 May 1869. The two commanders spent the next few days systematically destroying all settlements, crops and livestock in Ruatahuna in an attempt to drive the Tuhoe people to starvation. The mission faltered on 12 May when, after a brief clash with Te Kooti's advance guard, the Arawa fighters refused to advance beyond Ruatahuna and dozens of government forces, including Whitmore, succumbed to dysentery. Whitmore's men withdrew from the Ureweras within a week. Herrick's expedition, however, pushed on, finally reaching Onepoto, at the Lake Waikaremoana's south, on 24 May, and labored at building a fleet of boats to cross to the north side of the lake to where Te Kooti was sheltering‚Äîa venture that continued until 8 July when Herrick scuttled his boats and returned south. But Whitmore's scorched earth strategy had achieved its aim: in late May Tuhoe chiefs turned on Te Kooti and demanded he leave their territory. Te Kooti turned again towards Taupo, travelling in a convoy of about 200 people, 50 of them mounted. He seized prisoners and livestock at the settlement of Heruiwi, before launching a daring raid on an encampment of volunteer cavalry at Opepe, 20 km west of Lake Taupo, on 7 June, killing nine soldiers and capturing all their arms and horses. He destroyed the pƒÅ of two hapu who had earlier refused to give him refuge or assistance, then arrived on 10 June at Tauranga, at the southern end of Lake Taupo, occupying the settlement for more than a week before moving to Moerangi, southwest of the lake, taking more prisoners as he travelled. Early in July Te Kooti and his followers and prisoners, a group of possibly more than 800, set off for Tokangamutu, the temporary residence of MƒÅori King TƒÅwhiao near Te Kuiti, where he hoped to either force TƒÅwhiao into an alliance or topple him. Challenge to King TƒÅwhiao TƒÅwhiao. A meeting between Te Kooti and TƒÅwhiao, had it taken place, would have been a confrontation of two prophets and leaders, each of whom had taken diametrically opposed positions on further war with the government. While Te Kooti viewed warfare as the means by which his vision of the return of their land would be fulfilled, Tawhiao had renounced armed conflict and declared 1867-68 as the \\"year of the lamb\\" and \\"year of peace\\"; in April 1869 he had issued another proclamation that \\"the slaying of man by man is to cease\\". Though there were radical elements in the Kingitanga movement who favoured a resumption of war, including Rewi Maniapoto and possibly TƒÅwhiao himself, moderates continued to warn the King that they had little chance of success and risked annihilation by becoming involved in Te Kooti's actions. Te Kooti had been angered by TƒÅwhiao's refusal the previous November to send reinforcements during their campaigns near Gisborne and had then threatened that if he remained aloof he would be cursed by Jehovah, who would command Te Kooti to march to Te Kuiti and put the king and his people to the sword. Tamati Ngapora, a senior adviser to the King, had invited Te Kooti to Te Kuiti, but on the proviso that he came in peace. Te Kooti's response was one of defiance, warning that he was coming to \\"assume himself the authority which he coming directly from God was entitled to\\". His chief aim for the visit was simple: to rouse TƒÅwhiao's support for renewed war against the government and wrest back the confiscated land. Accompanied by Horonuku and about 200 Tuwharetoa, he arrived at Te Kuiti on 10 July 1869, immediately declaring that he was the host (tangata whenua) and that the Waikato were his visitors. At an assembly attended by 200 Waikato MƒÅori, Te Kooti urged them to hold the land and keep up the fighting. But though Te Kooti remained there for 15 days, with the village in a heightened state of tension as he continued to challenge the mana of the king, TƒÅwhiao refused to emerge from his home to meet him. Te Kooti was finally offered every support short of actual hostilities‚Äîas well as a place of sanctuary inland on the Mokau River under the protection of NgƒÅti Maniapoto. News of Te Kooti's presence in Te Kuiti, and the prospect of the two MƒÅori leaders forming an alliance, alarmed the government. Premier William Fox said the development heightened \\"the probability of a combined attack on the settled districts in the neighbourhood of Auckland\\" and both Houses of Parliament accepted government motions asking Major-General Sir Trevor Chute, commander of the British forces in New Zealand, to cancel orders for a planned withdrawal of the 18th Regiment, the sole remaining British regiment in New Zealand. Yet Binney has speculated that history could well have turned had TƒÅwhiao decided to join Te Kooti's campaign. In official correspondence between Auckland and London in 1869, Governor George Bowen advocated granting \\"a separate principality\\" for TƒÅwhiao as a means of attaining peace, while the British government similarly urged the colonial government to \\"cede the lands conquered by the Queen's troops\\" and surrender \\"the Queen's sovereignty\\" in those areas, while recognising \\"absolute dominion\\" by the King within his borders. Premier Fox, who was desperately trying to cut military expenditure, strongly opposed proposals for MƒÅori self-government under the MƒÅori king, as urged by Bowen and former Chief Justice Sir William Martin, but the formation of a more robust pan-MƒÅori alliance could have become a tipping point to create a system of separate MƒÅori rule in their territory.  Taupo campaign and defeat at Te P≈çrere  Captain John St George of the Hawkes Bay squadron of the Colonial Defence Force, who was killed during the storming of Te P≈çrere.Accompanied by Rewi Maniapoto, Te Kooti and his followers left Te Kuiti and returned to Taupo, settling briefly at its southern end on 18 August before launching a Taupo campaign that took him to the brink of defeat. News of his return prompted the formation near Taupo of a 700-strong government force, with all but about 100 of them kupapa: NgƒÅti Kahungunu (230 men), Wanganui (160), NgƒÅti Tuwharetoa (130) and Arawa (50). On 10 September 1869 Te Kooti's force of about 280 mounted a pre-emptive strike against a 120-man mounted NgƒÅti Kahungunu contingent, led by Henare Tomoana, which was camped at Tauranga-Taupo. But although Te Kooti took their horses and much of their equipment, he was forced to retreat under heavy fire. Three of his force were killed and several wounded. They then retreated to Moerangi, inside the relative security of the Rohe Potae or King's territory‚Äîan area the government considered too dangerous to attack, for fear of reviving Kingitanga aggression. At this point Rewi separated from Te Kooti and returned to the Waikato, unimpressed by Te Kooti's performance in battle and angered by the slaughter at Rotoaira on 7 September of four MƒÅori scouts with Waikato connections. Any chance of a compact between Te Kooti and the Kingitanga had now vanished. Less than two weeks later, on the morning of 25 September, Te Kooti returned to Tokaanu with 250 to 300 fighters for what eventuated as a disastrous attack. After striking from the densely forested hills of Te Ponanga saddle south of Tokaanu, they were driven back by a joint force of Henare Tomoana's NgƒÅti Kahungunu and Hohepa Tamamutu's Tuwharetoa. Te Kooti dug in at nearby Te Ponanga, but lost seven in battle, including Wi Piro, a close relative who had been prominent in all the Ringatu raids. The heads of his wounded warriors were severed by members of the government force. But the most ignominious defeat was to come. Amid sleet, snow and driving winds, Te Kooti began preparing an earthwork redoubt at Te P≈çrere near Papakai village, about 9 km west of Lake Rotoaira on the lower northwest slopes of Mount Tongariro. The redoubt was built in the form of a European fortification, about 20 metres square, with 3 metre-high walls built of sod and pumice, bound with layers of fern. The structure was designed for a fixed battle, a style of conflict that Te Kooti had previously avoided. Government forces, under the command of Major Thomas McDonnell, arrived at Papakai in the first week of October and launched an assault with 540 men on the morning of 4 October in heavy rain. NgƒÅti Kahungunu and Arawa forces led by Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui‚Äîbetter known to PƒÅkehƒÅ as Major Kemp‚Äîquickly took the outer trenches, then stormed the redoubt, discovering a fatal design flaw hindered the ability of those inside to effectively maintain fire on an attack force: the loopholes in the parapets had been built without allowing warriors to depress their gun barrels and aim at targets below. As the fight raged, Captain John St George‚Äîwho had fought since 1865 against Pai Marire and Ringatu forces‚Äîwas killed while leading his force on a charge, and a bullet struck Te Kooti in the hand and severed a finger. It was his third injury in battle, after sustaining an ankle injury at Puketapu and a shoulder wound at Ngatapa. In what turned out to be the last major battle of the New Zealand Wars, between 37 and 52 of Te Kooti's force were killed‚Äîa sixth of his fighting force‚Äîand more than 20 women and children taken prisoner at Te Porere. The government loss was four killed and four wounded. Within days Horonuku, who had been sheltering in the bush after escaping, surrendered. Belich noted: \\"Te Porere was Te Kooti's last stand in a prepared position, and his last attempt at anything other than raid, ambush and the evasion of pursuit.\\" Flight Te Kooti and his followers‚Äîmen, women and children‚Äîseparated and scattered after the Te P≈çrere defeat, many of them finding shelter in bushland in the upper Whanganui River. On 9 November Defence Minister Donald McLean met Rewi Maniapoto, Tamati Ngapora and other Kingitanga chiefs, demanding that they surrender Te Kooti. Rewi refused, declaring that he would provide a sanctuary for Te Kooti within the Rohe Potae as long as he remained peaceful, but would hand him over if he caused trouble. But at a hui of upper Whanganui chiefs 10 days later, influential chief Topia Turoa declared that in revenge for earlier killings by Te Kooti of several kinsmen and a priest in the Taupo district, he would start his own search for the Ringatu leader from the east, while Te Keepa (Major Kemp) would comb the forest from Taupo in the west. Topia's campaign against Te Kooti and his 30 immediate followers gained the approval of TƒÅwhiao, who now reversed his oath to sheath the sword, and the Whanganui chief sent out almost 400 scouts in search of his quarry. Premier William FoxAt the end of December 1869 to the first week of January 1870 both Te Keepa and Topia and their combined force of 600 came close to capturing Te Kooti‚Äîagain with a fighting force of about 90 and 200 women and children‚Äîin the upper Whanganui River near Taumarunui but were thwarted by floodwaters. On 16 January he reappeared at Tapapa, in the Waikato district, and arranged a meeting with Matamata settler and runholder Josiah Firth a day later. He sought Firth's help in achieving a truce with the government. He told him he would not surrender to the authorities, but said: \\"I am weary of fighting, and desire to live quietly at Tapapa. If I am let alone I will never fight more, and will not hurt man, woman or child.\\" Firth passed the message to Daniel Pollen, the government's agent for Auckland province, who promised that no military movement would occur while the two negotiated. But when Pollen returned to Auckland to pass on Te Kooti's proposal, he was rebuked by Fox, who ordered the agent to cease interfering in the military campaign. Fox wrote to Pollen that Te Kooti was \\"a midnight murderer of defenceless women and helpless children ... a man of atrocious cruelty and outrage\\" who was \\"repudiated and abhorred by the bulk of his people\\". Fox continued preparations for a large-scale confrontation and within days substantial forces were closing in on Tapapa: McDonnell and 250 men approached from Tokaanu up the eastern side of Lake Taupo; Te Keepa, Topia and 370 Wanganuis moved up the west side; Lieutenant-Colonel William Moule and 135 constabulary and militia came south from Cambridge and Lieutenant-Colonel James Fraser with 90 constabulary and 150 Arawa moved to block Te Kooti's retreat to the Urewera. Another 210 Arawa were also on the march to join McDonnell. Against those 1200 men, Te Kooti may have had as few as 100 men. Te Kooti slipped out of Tapapa as the force arrived, and on 24 January the government forces seized and burned the deserted village. Early the next morning Te Kooti launched a surprise raid on the military camp, with each side losing about four men before te Kooti was driven off. Although Te Keepa managed to recapture about 100 of the horses Te Kooti had been using, the government party lost the trail of the skilled guerrilla fighter. On 3 February 1870 there was one more skirmish as Te Kooti and 40 warriors, camping in dense bush at Paengaora as they travelled north towards present-day Te Puke, ambushed a 236-strong force led by Fraser, killing three or four, before vanishing again as they headed south. Four days later they appeared beside Lake Rotorua, where Te Kooti sought a truce directly with Te Mamaku and local Arawa, and asked local MƒÅori for permission for his party‚Äî240 men and 100 women‚Äîto cross their land towards Ruatahuna in the Ureweras. Gilbert Mair, who arrived soon after with a contingent of Arawa fighters, was angered by the request, which was being considered by local chiefs, and ordered his men to pursue Te Kooti. Following just 3 km behind, Mair's force began a 12 km chase that turned into a series of running battles, engaging the rearguard of Te Kooti's forces before being halted by an ambush. Two of Te Kooti's two key fighters, Peka Makarini and Timoti Hakopa died in that engagement and as night fell, Te Kooti and about 200 with him plunged into the bush, moving rapidly southeast through the night beyond Lake Rotokakahi before emerging in the Urewera, and under the protection of the Tuhoe. In 1886 Mair was awarded the New Zealand Cross for his bravery in the events of 7 February 1870. Pursuit Major Ropata WahawahaWithin days McDonnell was relieved of his command and McLean, as Native Minister, announced that from 11 February 1870 MƒÅori would control all the expeditions, with no European involvement. There would be no daily pay for soldiers, instead they would compete for ¬£5000 reward offered for Te Kooti's capture. The pursuit was instead led by both Te Keepa with his Whanganui warriors, and Ropata and his Ngati Porou, with two companies of Arawa Armed Constabulary, picked from the tribes at Rotorua, Rotoiti, Tarawera, Matata and Maketu, also joining the fight. On February 28 Te Kooti struck south of Whakatane, destroying a mill of an enemy chief, then a week later raided Opape, east of Opotiki, seizing arms and gunpowder and capturing more than 170 men, women and children, intending to hold them ransom to gain more male fighters for his force. He retreated to the Maraetahi region, about 10 km south of Opotiki, where he had established earlier a small village, complete with acres of maize and other crops. Te Kooti remained undisturbed there for a month until the arrival on March 25 of forces led by both Ropata‚Äîpicking their way up the boulder-strewn Waioeka River from the south‚Äîand Te Keepa, who was marching down the river from the north. An hour- long firefight erupted before the village and nearby Raipawa pƒÅ were taken. About 300 occupants were taken prisoner, all but 87 of them being Whakatohea prisoners, and about 19 taken captive were executed in the riverbed by tomahawk or gun. Te Kooti managed to flee with about 20 men. This was the end of Te Keepa's war. He and his men had pursued Te Kooti right across the North Island for seven months. They were operating far from their own territory, fighting on behalf of the Government against an enemy who had never threatened his own people. They felt they had done enough. The New Zealand Wars were over and it was time to go home. But the pursuit of Te Kooti was not over, for it was to continue for another two years. In July 1871 Ropata Wahawaha, Tom Porter and Ngati Porou were joined by Captain Gilbert Mair and Captain George Preece leading a taua (war party) of Arawa. Together they ranged through the Urewera Mountains, subjugating the Tuhoe and forcing them to hand over any fugitives they were sheltering. One welcome catch who fell into Ropata's hands was Kereopa Te Rau, accused of Volkner's murder ‚Äì he was worth 1000 pounds to his captors. On 22 September 1871, Captains Mair and Preece started from Fort Galatea on another Urewera expedition. The Arawa forces unexpectedly came upon Te Kooti's camp, which was taken after a brief skirmish. Wi Heretaunga was captured. He was believed to a participant in the murders of Captain James Wilson and his family at Matawhero in November 1868. He was also accused of being involved in the Mohaka massacre in April 1869. It was decided, that he should be shot, and this summary execution was carried out. When in camp Te Kooti usually slept some distance away from his followers. This habit had saved him at Maraetahi and it did so again. He was almost killed but another man intercepted the bullet. He fired one shot and fled, naked, into the bush, and the hunt continued. Early in February 1872, Preece received good information about the whereabouts of Te Kooti, at the junction of the Waiau and Mangaone Streams. On 13 February they found a camp that had been occupied only a few days previously. The next day they found a camp with a fire still burning and then spotted a group of people climbing the cliff on the opposite side of the flooded stream. One of them was Te Kooti. Shots were exchanged and the chase was on. Later the same day Nikora te Tuhi spotted Te Kooti in the distance and fired two shots at him. They both missed but they were the last shots fired in the New Zealand Wars. Te Kooti continued to elude the pursuers. On 15 May 1872 he crossed the Waikato River and once again entered the territory of the MƒÅori King, Tawhiao. This time he approached the King as supplicant and was granted asylum. Pardon and later years In 1883, the Government formally pardoned Te Kooti\\"How Te Kooti Gained a Pardon\\", Historic Poverty Bay and the East Coast, Joseph Angus Mackay as part of a deal with Tawhiao to put the Main Trunk Line through the King Country.\\"The Main Trunk Railway\\", The New Zealand Railways Magazine Almost immediately Te Kooti showed his gratitude by rescuing a surveyor, Wilson Hursthouse, who had been taken prisoner, stripped and chained up by Te Whiti o Rongomai's men from Parihaka.Redemption Songs. p 312. However Te Kooti remained unrepentant and belligerent. He went about armed with a revolver and threatened to take his gang back to Poverty Bay. He travelled extensively holding meetings to spread the ringatu message. He was often accompanied by large groups of supporters to places such as Whakatane and Opotiki. An observer noted 1,000 people gathered to hear him and the resident magistrate commented that for once Te Kooti was sober. Te Kooti was still far from popular with all Maori and was accused by chiefs of practicing maketu (black magic) to kill senior chiefs who he had previously opposed him. Chiefs were concerned that groups such as Ngati Awa and Ngati Pukeko would hand over the land to Te Kooti without any authority. The chiefs wrote to parliament to complain that Te Kooti was claiming mana over their land and instructing that the land should not be bought before the Native land Court. The chiefs were also concerned that the supplies of the communities were being drained by massive hui leading to the people being ill- prepared to face winter. Chiefs complained that Te Kooti was forcing his adherents to raise money for him by selling family crops and animals. School teachers and native officers sent report to the government that this was resulting in children being malnourished.Redemption Songs. p 384 Bush, the local magistrate, became concerned about \\"Te Kooti-ism\\" -Te Kooti was telling his followers that confiscated land would be returned by driving the Pakeha from the country.Redemption Songs. J Binney. Auckland University Press. 1996. pp 282-285. This alarmed the government and the people of Poverty Bay. In February a telegram signed by 20 chiefs went to parliament saying they would rise up if Te Kooti did not turn back.Redemption Songs. p 391-393. The government was keen to keep the peace. The Minister of Defence was concerned that Te Kooti had been directly threatened by his old adversaries Ropata and the Ngati Porou. The Prime Minister arranged a meeting in Auckland between himself, Te Kooti and the Native Minister where he was offered government land if he stayed away from Gisborne. Although cordial, Te Kooti told the officials that he determined to return. As a token of his peaceful intentions he surrendered a small revolver that he normally carried.Redemption Songs. p 390. The government shipped troops and artillery to Gisborne to form a military force of 377 under Major Porter in early 1889. Rumours of threats continued until the force went to Waioeka Pa and found Te Kooti drunk with 4 of his wives and some 400 supporters, who were arrested.Redemption Songs. p 410. He was bound over to keep the peace but as he could not afford the fine or bond he was taken to Mt Eden jail in Auckland where he was persuaded by the Ladies Temperance Movement to take the pledge against drinking alcohol and imprisoned for a short time before being released. Te Kooti wrote a letter of apology to the government explaining that his recent conduct had been caused by drink.Redemption Songs. p 413. Eventually in 1891 the government gave him an area of land at Wainui, where a marae for the Ringatu church was later established. Te Kooti died in 1893 in a cart accident while on his way to the land the government had given him. Aftermath In May 2013, at the tangi of MP Parekura Horomia, the Tuhoe iwi, who had initially supported Te Kooti and the rebel Hau Hau movement in their 19th century war against the government, gave a gift to Ngati Porou to end nearly 150 years of bitterness between the tribes. Ngati Porou had provided many of the soldiers who tracked down the guerilla leader in the late 1860s and had numerous conflicts with Tuhoe Hau Hau. During one conflict 120 Tuhoe Hau hau were captured and killed. Tuhoe leader Tu Waaka said he did not want successive generations to be encumbered by the events of the past.Waikato Times May 3, 2013 In fiction * Maurice Shadbolt's novel Season of the Jew is set during Te Kooti's War * The movie Utu is based very loosely around some incidents from Te Kooti's War References Literature and references * Belich, James (1988).

Tea culture in China differs from that in European countries like Britain and other East and Southeast Asian countries like Japan, Korea, Vietnam in preparation, taste, and occasion when it is consumed. Tea is still consumed regularly, both on casual and formal occasions. In addition to being a popular beverage, it is used in traditional Chinese medicine as well as in Chinese cuisine. Etymology A tea house in Shanghai, China A tea house in Presidential Palace Garden in Nanjing, China The concept of tea culture is referred to in Chinese as chayi (\\"the art of drinking tea\\"), or cha wenhua (\\"tea culture\\"). The word cha (Ëå∂) denotes the beverage that is derived from Camellia sinensis, the tea plant. Prior to the 8th century BCE, tea was known collectively under the term Ëçº (pinyin: t√∫) along with a great number of other bitter plants. These two Chinese characters are identical, with the exception of an additional horizontal stroke in the Chinese lettering Ëçº, which translates to tea. The older character is made up of the radical Ëâ∏ (pinyin: c«éo) in its reduced form of Ëâπ and the character ‰Ωô (pinyin: y√∫), which gives the phonetic cue. Tea drinking customs A set of equipment for drinking tea A hostess serves tea at a traditional Chinese tea house. There are several special circumstances in which tea is prepared and consumed in Chinese culture, and is preserved completely in Mainland China and Taiwan. ;A sign of respect :According to Chinese tradition, members of the younger generation should show their respect to members of the older generation by offering a cup of tea. Inviting their elders to restaurants for tea is a traditional holiday activity. In the past, people of a lower social class served tea to the upper class in society. Today, with the increasing liberalization of Chinese society, this rule and its connotations have become blurred. ;To apologize :In Chinese culture, tea may be offered as part of a formal apology. For example, children who have misbehaved may serve tea to their parents as a sign of regret and submission. ;To show gratitude and celebrate weddings :In the traditional Chinese marriage ceremony, the bride and groom kneel in front of their respective parents and serve them tea and then thank them, together which represents an expression of their gratitude and respect. According to the tradition, the bride serves the groom's family, and the groom serves the bride's family. This process symbolizes the joining together of the two families. Finger tapping Light finger tapping is an informal way to thank the tea master or tea server for tea. While or after one's cup is filled, the receiver of the tea may tap the index and middle fingers (one or more in combination) to express gratitude to the person who served the tea. This custom is common in southern Chinese, where their meals often are accompanied by many servings of tea. This custom is said to have originated in the Qing dynasty when the Qianlong Emperor traveled in disguise throughout the empire and his accompanying servants were instructed not to reveal their master's identity. One day in a restaurant, the emperor poured tea for a servant. To that servant it was a huge honor to have the emperor pour him a cup of tea. Out of habit, he wanted to kneel and express his thanks to the emperor, but he could not do this since that would reveal the emperor's identity. Instead, he tapped the table with bent fingers to represent kneeling to the Emperor and to express his gratitude and respect. In this sense, the bent fingers supposedly signify a bowing servant. In formal tea ceremonies nodding the head or saying \\"thank you\\" is more appropriate. Brewing Chinese tea Four Chinese tea cups The different ways of brewing Chinese tea depend on variables like the formality of the occasion, the means of the people preparing it, and the kind of tea being brewed. For example, green teas are more delicate than oolong teas or black teas; therefore, green tea should be brewed with cooler water. The most informal method of brewing tea is to simply add the leaves to a pot containing hot water. This method is commonly found in households and restaurants, for example, in the context of dim sum or yum cha in Cantonese restaurants. Another method for serving tea is to use a small lidded bowl called a gaiwan. The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty contributed to the development of loose tea brewing by banning the production of compressed tea. =Gongfu cha (Kung fu tea)= A Yixing clay teapot Gongfu cha, meaning \\"making tea with skill\\", is a popular method of preparing tea in China. It makes use of small Yixing teapots holding about 100‚Äì150 ml (4 or 5 fl.oz.), the size being thought to enhance the aesthetics and to \\"round out\\" the taste of the tea being brewed. Brewing tea in a Yixing teapot can be done for private enjoyment as well as to welcome guests. Depending on the region of China, there may be differences in the steps of brewing as well as the tools used in the process. For example, Taiwanese-style gongfu cha makes use of several additional instruments including tweezers and a tea strainer. The procedure is mostly applicable to oolong teas, but it is some used to make pu'er and other fermented teas. Influence on Chinese culture Tea has had a major influence on the development of Chinese culture, and Chinese traditional culture is closely connected with Chinese tea. Tea is often associated with literature, arts, and philosophy and is closely connected with Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. Roughly since the Tang Dynasty, drinking tea has been an essential part of self-cultivation. Chinese Chan (similar to Japanese Zen) philosophy is also linked with drinking tea. =Teaware= Traditionally, tea drinkers were regarded as the 'academic' and 'cultural elites' of the society. The practice of drinking tea was considered to be an expression of personal morality, education, social principles, and status. Increased enthusiasm for tea drinking led to the greater production of teaware, which significantly popularized Chinese porcelain culture. =Teahouse= traditional arts Ancient Chinese scholars used the teahouse as a place for sharing ideas. The teahouse was a place where political allegiances and social rank were said to have been temporarily suspended in favor of an honest and rational discourse. The leisurely consumption of tea promoted conviviality and civility amongst the participants. The teahouse is not only a minor by-product of Chinese tea culture; it offers historical evidence of Chinese tea history. Today, people can also sense a kind of humanistic atmosphere in Beijing's Lao She Teahouse and in other teahouses in East China cities like Hangzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Shaoxing, Shanghai, and other places. The teahouse atmosphere is still dynamic and vigorous. =Modern culture= In modern China, virtually every dwelling‚Äîeven down to the simplest mud hut‚Äîhas a set of tea implements for brewing a cup of hot tea. They are symbols of welcome for visitors or neighbors. Traditionally, a visitor to a Chinese home is expected to sit down and drink tea while talking; visiting while remaining standing is considered uncouth. Folding the napkin in tea ceremonies is a traditional act in China performed to keep away bad qi energy. In Taiwan, tea ceremonies are held not only in daily life but also on important occasions. Tea was regarded as one of the seven daily necessities, the others being firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar. There are several types of tea: green tea, oolong tea, red tea, black tea, white tea, yellow tea, puerh tea and flower tea. Traditionally, fresh tea leaves are regularly turned over in a deep bowl. This process allows the leaves dry in a way that preserves their full flavor, ready for use.

Anzac Wallace, who had done little acting up until that point, takes the starring role of Te Wheke, a warrior who sets out to get vengeance after British forces kill his people. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence and Kelly Johnson. Sometimes described as \\"a Maori Western\\", Utu was reputed to have one of the largest budgets for a New Zealand film up until that time. The film screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, and became the second most successful local movie released in New Zealand to that date. Positive reviews in America, including a rave review from Pauline Kael, helped win Murphy directing work in Hollywood. Partly inspired by events from Te Kooti's War, the film tells of a MƒÅori soldier setting out to get utu, or vengeance, on his former allies after the British army destroys his home village and kills his uncle. The film is set in the 1870s. In 2013, partly thanks to the longtime existence of an alternative cut of the film aimed at international audiences, which Geoff Murphy had never been happy with, he completed work on a restored and recut version. Utu Redux, as it is known, premiered at the Wellington International Film Festival on 26 July 2013. Plot Set in New Zealand's North Island during the New Zealand Wars, Utu follows Te Wheke (Anzac Wallace), a Maori Captain in the British army. When Te Wheke's unit comes across a village that has been slaughtered he, recognising it as his own, deserts the army and organises a guerilla force to terrorise the invading British forces. When the unit destroys the home of Williamson (Bruno Lawrence) and kills his wife, Williamson vows to hunt down Te Wheke and kill him himself. Meanwhile, army scout Wiremu (Wi Kuki Kaa) and recent Boer War veteran Lieutenant Scott (Kelly Johnson) aim to track down Te Wheke themselves, also using guerilla warfare techniques against the will of corrupt Colonel Elliot (Tim Eliott).

Its grand scale warranted the use of a large second unit, which again was rare in the context of a young New Zealand cinema.Martin, Helen and Sam Edwards. New Zealand Film: 1912‚Äì1996. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 87-88. During production Murphy was very interested in authenticity, trying to keep it as period accurate as possible. To accomplish this many of the extras used were local Maori and in order for Te Wheke's moko to look realistic, Anzac Wallace would spend 4 hours having it applied each day of shooting. Reception The film's immediate reception was less positive than Murphy's earlier works, although still positive. Locally the film was very commercially successful, being New Zealand's second highest- grossing film at the time (behind Murphy's previous effort, Goodbye Pork Pie). Critically the film had a mixed positive reception. Filmmaker Costa Botes noted that ‚ÄúUtu‚Äôs shotgun approach to the great New Zealand film ultimately leaves it feeling episodic and tangled‚Äù. New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael however gave the film an exceptionally positive review, saying that ‚Äú[Geoff Murphy] seems to be directing with a grin on his face, [...] the ferocity of these skirmishes and raids is played off against an Arcadian beauty that makes your head swim.‚Äù Similarly Variety described that ‚ÄúMurphy has produced powerful images and strong performances.‚Äù The release of the film prompted public discussion of a revisionist look at New Zealand history. Film academic Roger Horrocks pointed out that ‚ÄúUtu was an uneven film but succeeded in stirring up more discussion of New Zealand history than any recent book has done.‚Äù Track listing # \\"Theme From Utu\\" # \\"Drummers\\" # \\"Patrol\\" # \\"Destroyed Village\\" # \\"Te Wheke Stalks Emily\\" # \\"Moko\\" # \\"The Raid; After the Raid\\" # \\"Williamson Retaliates\\" # \\"Quadruple Barrelled Shotgun; The Army Approaches Te Puna\\" # \\"Waiata Tangi; Kura and Henare\\" # \\"Night Sentry\\" # \\"Fishing; After the Battle\\" # \\"Williamson Reflects\\" # \\"Te Wheke's Trek\\" # \\"Williamson Prepares for Utu\\" # \\"Death of Te Wheke (lament) and Finale\\" The soundtrack was recorded by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir William Southgate.https://sounz.org.nz/works/10654 References External links * *Utu at New Zealand Film Commission *Utu at NZ On Screen Category:1983 films Category:1983 drama films Category:1980s historical films Category:English-language films Category:MƒÅori-language films Category:New Zealand films Category:New Zealand Wars films Category:New Zealand historical films Category:British Empire war films Category:Films directed by Geoff Murphy Category:Films set in New Zealand Category:Films shot in New Zealand Category:Films set in the 1870s ","title":"Utu (film)"},{"id":"267210","text":"Events *May 10 ‚Äì A deputy is appointed to take charge of Geoffrey Chaucer‚Äôs duties at customs, Chaucer being busy with diplomatic business.

The Prince Edward road occupies the northern part of Mong Kok. Mong Kok is one of the major shopping areas in Hong Kong. The area is characterised by a mixture of old and new multi-story buildings, with shops and restaurants at street level, and commercial or residential units above. Major industries in Mong Kok are retail, restaurants (including fast food) and entertainment. It has been described and portrayed in films as an area in which triads run bars, nightclubs, and massage parlors. With its extremely high population density of 130,000/km2 or 340,000 per square mile, Mong Kok was described as the busiest district in the world by the Guinness World Records. Name Until 1930, the area was called Mong Kok Tsui (ËäíËßíÂò¥).Yau Tsim Mong District Council, You Jian Wang Qu Fengwuzhi(Ê≤πÂ∞ñÊó∫ÂçÄÈ¢®Áâ©Âøó), Hong Kong: 1999. p18. \\"Mong Kok Tsui\\"(ËäíËßíÂò¥) The current English name is a transliteration of its older Chinese name ÊúõËßí (; ), or ËäíËßí (; ), which is named for its plentiful supply of ferns in the past when it was a coastal region. Its present Chinese name \\"Êó∫Ëßí\\" (; ), means \\"prosperous corner\\" or \\"crowded corner\\", however, the English name did not change. For a period, the area was also called Argyle, and this name was used for the MTR station when it opened in 1979. The office building , which was named after the area, is known in English as Argyle Centre rather than Mong Kok Centre. Administration Mong Kok is part of Yau Tsim Mong District. It was part of the Mong Kok District before the district was merged in 1994. The area belongs to the Kowloon West geographical constituency of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. History Displays at the Chinese University of Hong Kong include antique potteries indicating that there might have been settlements in the area as early as the Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì420). The area used to be a Hakka settlement, with about 200 villagers according to Bao'an records in 1819. The heart of the present-day Mong Kok is along Argyle Street near Sai Yeung Choi Street whilst the proper Mong Kok used to be to the north, near the present- day Mong Kok East Station. Mong Kok was an area of cultivated lands, bounded to the south by Argyle Street, to the west by Coronation Road (a section of present-day Nathan Road), and to the east by hills. To the southeast of Mong Kok is Ho Man Tin and to the west Tai Kok Tsui. On 10 August 2008 the Cornwall Court fire broke out. More than 200 firefighters were involved in the rescue operation. Four people died, including two firefighters. Mong Kok received a lot of negative media attention for many acid attacks on Sai Yeung Choi Street from December 2008 through January 2010. The area was the site of protracted demonstrations during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, including the gau wu campaign, and was also the site of the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest. Streets and markets Ladies' Market Sai Yeung Choi Street South Fa Yuen Street Flower Market Road Grand Century Place. Mong Kok East Station is visible at the bottom left. The area in the background is part of Kowloon City District. Mong Kok preserves its traditional characteristics with an array of markets, small shops, and food stalls that have disappeared from other areas during the past several decades of economic developments and urban transformation. As such, a few of these streets in Mong Kok have acquired nicknames reflecting their own characteristics. Some interesting sites are: * Tung Choi Street () (also known as , Ladies' market) ‚Äì This market specialises in women's clothing, accessories, and cosmetics, and is open daily from noon to midnight. There are also food stalls selling noodles, seafood, and congee. An open-air market of fruits and vegetables is also located in the vicinity. * Sai Yeung Choi Street South () ‚Äì A street full of shops selling consumer electronic products, cosmetics, and discount books. The latter are usually located on the lower floors of buildings. * Yuen Po Street Bird Garden () ‚Äì Hundreds of songbirds in exquisitely crafted cages can be seen at this market. The garden is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and is located near Mong Kok Stadium, to the north of Mong Kok East Station and east of Prince Edward Station. *: The garden was completed in 1997 for the relocation of booths selling birds at Hong Lok Street (), aka. \\"Bird Street\\", which was closed due to urban renewal in June 1998. * Fa Yuen Street () (also known as ) ‚Äì This is a small neighbourhood of small retailers selling sports equipment and clothing. The shops stock a diversity of sports shoes, including many shoes of rare or special editions from different places. * Flower Market Road () ‚Äì The street and the nearby side streets are packed with florists and street vendors selling flowers and plants. At the end of the street is Yuen Po Street Bird Garden. * Goldfish street () or Goldfish Market ‚Äì Centered on a section of Tung Choi Street, north of Bute Street. There are dozens of shops and hawkers selling tropical freshwater and marine fish, aquariums and accessories. This market opens very early in the morning. * Tile Street () ‚Äì This is a section of Portland Street near Argyle Street and Bute Street with more than 50 retailers selling materials for construction or renovation, such as tiles, wall paper, window frames and bath tubs. * Photocopy Street () ‚Äì A neighbourhood near Yim Po Fong Street and Soy Street is noted for its remarkable number of photocopying shops due to the number of schools in the vicinity. * Portland Street () ‚Äì A red-light district featuring numerous shops and restaurants. * Kwong Wa Street (), between Dundas Street and Yim Po Fong Street, is famous for shops selling airsoft, RC racing, modelling and other hobbying equipment. * Dundas Street () marks the southern end of the shopping area in eastern Mong Kok, where Sai Yeung Choi Street South, Tung Choi Street and Fa Yuen Street terminate. It is named for Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, former British Home Secretary and Secretary of State for War. Ho King Shopping Centre, Ka Lok Shopping Arcade and Trendy Zone are major shopping centres on the street. Various kinds of food shops concentrate on this street. Kwong Wah Hospital is also situated on the street. Across Nathan Road, the section in the western Mong Kok is relatively quiet and there are many caf√©s above street level in several buildings. Some popular shopping plazas located in this dense area include: Langham Place, 4th floor * Sino Centre () ‚Äì Shops sell comic books, VCDs and DVDs related to Japanese cartoons, and regular CD albums. There are also several Japanese style karaoke booths, which can be booked by the hour. * Ho King Shopping Centre () ‚Äì Visitors can find computer and video games sold for relatively low prices. The fourth floor of the plaza is infamous for being formerly the biggest base of pornographic CDs and DVDs, and activities have diminished due to police and customs operations. However, some shops have been driven to the office section of the building. * Grand Century Place () ‚Äì Situated next to Mong Kok East station, visitors can find famous-brand and popular shops. * Mong Kok Computer Centre ()- This three-story computer mall has around 50 to 70 computer shops, selling laptops, software, hardware and computer accessories. * Langham Place () ‚Äì This is a 59-storey complex with a shopping mall, a hotel, and offices. It opened in 2004 and was constructed based on the Hong Kong Government urban redevelopment scheme. It is the tallest building in Mong Kok. *Argyle Centre () ‚Äì This usually crowded centre, located next to Mong Kok Station, has three floors of shops selling low-priced clothes and shoes, plastic toys and heavy metal CDs. Other streets in the area include: * Bute Street (), named after John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1762 and 1763. It may also have been named after the Scottish peerage of the same name, following the naming pattern of several other streets in the area. * Fife Street () is a street that is north of Argyle Street, south of Mong Kok Road, and perpendicular to Nathan Road. The Chinese name means \\"fast wealth\\" in English, but the name is a loanword based on the English pronunciation of the fife instrument. * Soy Street ()  Food  The Mong Kok area has many food-booths selling traditional snacks such as fish balls, fried beancurd (tofu) and various dim sum. These fingerfoods are very popular in Hong Kong, especially for folks on the run. In addition, there are restaurants serving different kinds of cuisine, ranging from Japanese to Thai to Italian.  Built heritage  Nos. 600‚Äì626 Shanghai Street Built heritage in Mog Kok includes: * Several tong-lau, including Nos. 600‚Äì626 Shanghai Street and Lui Seng Chun on Lai Chi Kok Road. Both are listed as Grade I historic buildings. * Old Kowloon Police Headquarters, built in 1925. Grade II historic building and one of the historic police station buildings in Hong Kong. Now part of the Mong Kok Police Station. * Shui Yuet Temple (Ê∞¥ÊúàÂÆÆ), located at No. 90 Shantung Street. Built in 1927, it is dedicated to Guanyin.

Popular culture Mong Kok was the setting for the 2004 hit film One Night in Mongkok directed by Derek Yee. The movie portrays Mong Kok, one of the most densely populated places on Earth, as a hotbed of illicit activity. Similarly, the district was also the setting of the 1996 film Mongkok Story (Êó∫ËßíÈ¢®Èõ≤) directed by Wilson Yip, which depicts a young man who becomes involved in a triad gang. The 2009 film To Live and Die in Mongkok is also set in Mong Kok. The literal Chinese title of the 1988 film As Tears Go By by Wong Kar-wai is \\"Mong Kok Carmen\\". Part of Robert Ludlum's 1986 novel The Bourne Supremacy was set in Mong Kok. The area is known locally for a youth subculture, the Mong Kok culture. 2014 protests Mong Kok was one of the main sites of the 2014 Hong Kong protests. Banks, jewellery stores and clothing stores were closed as a result of the pro-democracy protests.

In modern-day usage, it often refers to the celebrations following a successful elk hunt, or a feast at the end of a hunting season. It may also be used in a figurative sense, denoting any memorial held for things that have come to an end (\\"peijaiset\\" over e.g. bankrupt companies). Traditionally, it referred to wakes for humans and animals, but also other celebrations, depending on the region in question. Karhunpeijaiset are a celebration held for the soul of a bear after a bear hunt. Traditionally, a bear was never \\"hunted\\"; it was merely brought down. A single man could claim to have hunted and killed a bear, but when the entire community was involved, the bear was simply said to have died. The bear's spirit had to be told that it had simply fallen into a pit or that it had otherwise killed itself by accident, not by the hunters: this was done to appease the bear's spirit so that it would not be offended and possibly enact some kind of revenge upon the hunters. The ceremony was always a much more elaborate affair than what the most influential member of the community would have merited. In eastern Finland it would have copious mourners and wailers, and the people would address the bear as a relative, or the son of a god. Its flesh was not eaten -- that would have been cannibalism -- or, if it was, an elaborate show was made to symbolically render the meat into that of another animal, e.g. venison. The bear's head was usually mounted on the top of a young tree, or on a pike, so as to help the bear's spirit climb up into the stars, where it was believed bears' souls had come from. Carrion-eaters would then eat it, leaving only the skull, which would then become an object of veneration. A courtyard would also be cleared around the skull. Traditionally, only bears were honoured thus. Sometimes the ceremony was performed in the fashion of a sacred marriage rather than a wake. In such cases the bear was either propped up inside of a frame or strapped to a cross. With all due ceremony, the chosen bride or groom would symbolically marry the bear. In the present day, peijaiset usually refers to a celebration at the end of a successful hunt or the end of a hunting season, and they are usually only held for moose and bears. On many occasions this involves a festive evening meal for the hunters, made from the latest kill. Similar customs have been reported from many other northern people who share their habitat with bears.

It is also known as Mount Austin, and locally as The Peak. With an elevation of , it is the highest hill on Hong Kong island, ranked 31 in terms of elevation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Tai Mo Shan is the highest point in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with an elevation of ). The summit is occupied by a radio telecommunications facility and is closed to the public. However, the surrounding area of public parks and high-value residential land is the area that is normally meant by the name The Peak. It is a major tourist attraction that offers views of Central, Victoria Harbour, Lamma Island, and the surrounding islands. History As early as the 19th century, the Peak attracted prominent European residents because of its panoramic view over the city and its temperate climate compared to the sub- tropical climate in the rest of Hong Kong. The sixth Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Richard MacDonnell had a summer residence built on the Peak circa 1868. Those that built houses named them whimsically, such as The Eyrie, and the Austin Arms. These original residents reached their homes by sedan chairs, which were carried up and down the steep slope of Victoria Peak. This limited development of the Peak until the opening of the Peak Tram funicular in 1888. The boost to accessibility caused by the opening of the Peak Tram created demand for residences on the Peak. Between 1904 and 1930, the Peak Reservation Ordinance designated the Peak as an exclusive residential area reserved for non-Chinese. They also reserved the Peak Tram for the use of such passengers during peak periods. The Peak remains an upmarket residential area, although residency today is based on wealth. In 1905 construction of the Pinewood Battery was completed on the western side of the Peak. Harlech Road was constructed around the Peak as a means of resupply to this artillery and later anti-aircraft battery. Ecology The Peak is home to many species of birds, most prominently the black kite, and numerous species of butterflies. Wild boar and porcupines are also seen on Peak, along with a variety of snakes. Tourism With some seven million visitors every year, the Peak is a major tourist attraction of Hong Kong.DeWolf, Christopher \\"9 Hong Kong tourist traps ‚Äì for better or worse\\" CNN Go. 27 October 2010. Retrieved 3 March 2012. It has views of the city and its waterfront. The viewing deck also has coin-operated telescopes that the visitors can use to enjoy the cityscape. The number of visitors led to the construction of two major leisure and shopping centres, the Peak Tower and the Peak Galleria, situated adjacent to each other. The Peak Tower incorporates the upper station of the Peak Tram, the funicular railway that brings passengers up from the St. John's Anglican Cathedral in Hong Kong's Central district, whilst the Peak Galleria incorporates the bus station used by the Hong Kong public buses and green minibuses on the Peak. The Peak is also accessible by taxi and private car via the circuitous Peak Road, or by walking up the steep Old Peak Road from near the Zoological Botanical Gardens or the Central Green Trail from Hong Kong Park. The nearest MTR station is Central. Victoria Peak Garden is located on the site of Mountain Lodge, the Governor's old summer residence, and is the closest publicly accessible point to the summit. It can be reached from Victoria Gap by walking up Mount Austin Road, a climb of about . Another popular walk is the level loop along Lugard and Harlech Roads, giving good views of the entire Hong Kong Harbour and Kowloon, as well as Lantau and Lamma Islands, encircling the summit at the level of the Peak Tower. There are several restaurants on Victoria Peak, most of which are located in the two shopping centres. However, the Peak Lookout Restaurant, is housed in an older and more traditional building which was originally a spacious house for engineers working on the Peak Tramway. It was rebuilt in 1901 as a stop area for sedan chairs, but was re-opened as a restaurant in 1947. In addition to being a major tourist attraction for Hong Kong, The Peak is also the summit of Hong Kong's property market. Properties on The Peak can be as expensive as anywhere else in the world.

They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which itself is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. Extant river dolphins are placed in two superfamilies, Platanistoidea and Inioidea. They comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins) (Old World family), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins) and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins) (New World families). There are five extant species of river dolphins. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, from which they diverged about 40 million years ago. River dolphins are relatively small compared to other dolphins, having evolved to survive in warm, shallow water and strong river currents. They range in size from the long South Asian river dolphin to the and Amazon river dolphin. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than the females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. River dolphins use their conical-shaped teeth and long beaks to capture fast-moving prey in murky water. They have well-developed hearing that is adapted for both air and water; they do not really rely on vision since the water they swim in is usually very muddy. These species are well-adapted to living in warm, shallow waters, and, unlike other cetaceans, have little to no blubber. River dolphins are not very widely distributed; they are all restricted to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction. River dolphins feed primarily on fish. Male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles. River dolphins are rarely kept in captivity; breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. , there were only four river dolphins in captivity. Taxonomy and evolution =Classification= Four families of river dolphins (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, is the only living family in the superfamily Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated the Ganges and Indus river dolphins as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct. With their disappearance, one of the recently accepted superfamilies, Lipotoidea, has become extinct. The current classification of river dolphins is as follows: Life reconstruction of Arktocara yakataga, an allodelphinid * Superfamily Platanistoidea ** Family Platanistidae *** Genus Platanista **** South Asian river dolphin, Platanista gangetica, with two subspecies ***** Ganges river dolphin (susu), P. g. gangetica ***** Indus river dolphin (bhulan), P. g. minor ** Family ‚Ä†Allodelphinidae (Oligocene - Miocene) ** Family ‚Ä†Squalodelphinidae (Oligocene to Miocene) ** Family ‚Ä†Squalodontidae (Oligocene to Miocene) ** Family ‚Ä†Waipatiidae (Oligocene to Miocene) * Superfamily Inioidea ** Family Iniidae *** Genus Inia **** Amazon river dolphin (boto), Inia geoffrensis ***** Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis ***** Inia geoffrensis humbotiana **** Araguaian river dolphin, Inia araguaiaensis **** Bolivian river dolphin, Inia boliviensis *** Genus ‚Ä†Meherrinia (late Miocene) *** Genus ‚Ä†Isthminia (Miocene) ** Family Pontoporiidae *** Genus ‚Ä†Auroracetus **** ‚Ä†Auroracetus bakerae *** Genus Pontoporia **** La Plata dolphin (Franciscana), Pontoporia blainvillei * Superfamily (?‚Ä†) Lipotoidea ** Family (?‚Ä†) Lipotidae *** Genus (?‚Ä†) Lipotes **** (?‚Ä†) Baiji (or Chinese river dolphin), Lipotes vexillifer (possibility extinct) In 2012 the Society for Marine Mammalogy began considering the Bolivian (Inia geoffrensis boliviensis) and Amazonian (Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis) subspecies as full species Inia boliviensis and Inia geoffrensis, respectively; however, much of the scientific community, including the IUCN, continue to consider the Bolivian population to be a subspecies of Inia geoffrensis.Reeves, R.R., Jefferson, T.A., Karczmarski, L., Laidre, K., O‚ÄôCorry-Crowe, G., Rojas-Bracho, L., Secchi, E.R., Slooten, E., Smith, B.D., Wang, J.Y. & Zhou, K. (2011). Inia geoffrensis. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species In October 2014, the Society for Marine Mammalogy took Inia boliviensis and Inia araguaiaensis off their list of aquatic mammal species and subspecies and currently does not recognize these species-level separations. =Evolution= Phylogeny of cetaceans based on cytochrome b gene sequences, showing the distant relationship between Platanista and other river dolphins. River dolphins are members of the infraorder Cetacea, which are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. The primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5‚Äì10 million years later. It is unknown when river dolphins first ventured back into fresh water. River dolphins are thought to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is polyphyletic. Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins. Isthminia panamensis is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Pi√±a, Panama. River dolphin has been considered a taxonomic description, suggesting an evolutionary relationship among the group, although it is now known that they form two distinct clades. 'True' river dolphins are descendants of ancient evolutionary lineages that evolved in freshwater environments. Some species of cetacean live in rivers and lakes, but are more closely related to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis. The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) in the Amazon River is another species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, it does not perfectly fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that, although the species may be found in both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers may not be able to survive in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).Secchi, E. (2012). Sotalia fluviatilis. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species The Franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) has shown a converse evolutionary pattern, and has an ancient evolutionary lineage in freshwater, but inhabits estuarine and coastal waters. Biology =Anatomy= Indus river dolphin skull River dolphins have a torpedo shaped body with a flexible neck, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a tail fin, and a small bulbous head. River dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, a long snout and eyes placed on the sides of the head. River dolphins are rather small, ranging in size from the long South Asian river dolphin to the and Amazon river dolphin. They all have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. River dolphins are polygynous, meaning male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins have conical teeth, used to catch swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four times longer than most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They do not have the iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats. River dolphins have a relatively thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs. =Locomotion= River dolphins have two flippers and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although river dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. River dolphins are slow swimmers in comparison to oceanic dolphins, which can travel at speeds up to ; the tucuxi can only travel at about . Unlike other cetaceans, their neck vertebrae are not fused together, meaning they have greater flexibility than other non-terrestrial aquatic mammals, at the expense of speed. This means they can turn their head without actually moving their entire body. When swimming, river dolphins rely on their tail fins to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. River dolphins swim by moving their tail fins and lower bodies up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. All species have a dorsal fin. =Senses= Biosonar by cetaceans River dolphins have very small eyes The ears of river dolphins have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat- filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive even if they are blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight. River dolphins have very small eyes for their size, and do not have a very good sense of sight. In addition, the eyes are placed on the sides of the head, so the vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When river dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light. They have both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Most river dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on their eyelids and an outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea. Olfactory lobes are absent in river dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell. River dolphins are not thought to have a sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some dolphins have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste. Interactions with humans =Threats= Development Conservation areas for the baiji along the Yangtze River Development and agriculture have had devastating impacts on the habitats on river dolphins. The total population of Araguaian river dolphins is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500 individuals, and genetic diversity is limited. The ecology of their habitat has been adversely affected by agricultural, ranching and industrial activities, as well as by the use of dams for hydroelectric power. The inhabited section of the Araguaia River probably extends over about out of a total length of . The Tocantins river habitat is fragmented by six hydroelectric dams, so the population there is at particular risk. Its probable eventual IUCN status is vulnerable or worse. Both subspecies of South Asian river dolphins have been very adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected. As China developed economically, pressure on the baiji river dolphin grew significantly. Industrial and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze. The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations. Ship traffic multiplied, boats grew in size, and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets. Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers. Stocks of the dolphin's prey declined drastically in the late 20th century, with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre-industrial levels. In the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals, but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. On December 13, 2006, the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) was declared \\"functionally extinct\\", after a 45-day search by leading experts in the field failed to find a single specimen. The last verified sighting was in September 2004. Competition The region of the Amazon in Brazil has an extension of containing diverse fundamental ecosystems. One of these ecosystems is a floodplain, or a v√°rzea forest, and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption. The v√°rzea is also a major source of income through excessive local commercialized fishing. V√°rzea consist of muddy river waters containing a vast number and diversity of nutrient-rich species. The abundance of distinct fish species lures the Amazon River dolphin into the v√°rzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding. In addition to attracting predators such as the Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon river dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen. The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources prohibit fishermen from killing the Amazon river dolphin, yet they are not compensated for the damage to their equipment and the loss of their catch. Bycatch During the process of catching the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins get caught in the nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions. For example, of the 15 dolphin carcasses found in the Japur√° River in 2010‚Äì2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because a variety of factors make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species. =In captivity= The only trained Amazon river dolphin in the world at the Acuario de Valencia, Venezuela A baiji conservation dolphinarium was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large, only kidney shaped tanks with dimensions of arc width and depth, diameter, deep and diameter, deep, and are not capable of holding many baijis at one time. Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last Chance to See. The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (Ê∑áÊ∑á) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (ÁôΩÈ±ÄË±öÊ∞¥ÊóèÈ¶Ü) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian-e-Zhou Baiji Semi-natural Reserve (Áü≥È¶ñÂçäËá™ÁÑ∂ÁôΩÈ±ÄË±ö‰øùÊä§Âå∫), which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990, was flooded. The Amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums. Today, only three exist in captivity: one in Acuario de Valencia in Venezuela, one in Zoologico de Guistochoca in Peru, and one in Duisburg Zoo in Germany. Several hundred were captured between the 1950s and 1970s, and were distributed in dolphinariums throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. Around 100 went to US dolphinariums, and of that, only 20 survived; the last (named Chuckles) died in Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002. =In mythology= Ganga on a river dolphin  Asia  In Hindu mythology, the Ganges river dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river. The dolphin is said to be one of the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens, and Ganga's mount, the Makara, is sometimes depicted as a dolphin. In Chinese mythology, the baiji has many origin stories. For example, near the mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her stepfather, whom she had longed to get away from. The stepfather wanted to trade her since she would be sold for a great sum of money, but as they were crossing the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in. The enraged stepfather tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river, was transformed into a dolphin before she drowned, and swam away from her abusive stepfather, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise. In another story, the baiji was the daughter of a general deported from the city of Wuhan during a war who ran away while her father was in duty. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general. When he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame, and his daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin and the general into a porpoise.  South America  Amazon river dolphins, known by the natives as the boto, encantados or toninas, are very prevalent in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in mythology with superior musical ability, seductiveness and love of sex that often results in illegitimate children, and attraction to parties. Despite the fact that the Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies. Transformation into human form is said to be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not disappear with the shapeshift. Besides the ability to shapeshift into human form, encantados frequently wield other magical abilities, such as controlling storms, hypnotizing humans into doing their will, transforming humans into encantados, and inflicting illness, insanity, and even death. Shamans often intervene in these situations. Kidnapping is also a common theme in such folklore. Encantados are said to be fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, children born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among people who live near the Amazon River that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, but the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.

Gavialidae have conventionally consisted of only one surviving species, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), which is native to India and Nepal. Many extinct species are also known. The false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) has usually been thought to be a member of the family Crocodylidae based on several characters including skull morphology, but has sometimes been viewed as a member of this family due to general similarities in morphology and habit. Numerous molecular studies have consistently shown the two species to be each other's closest living relative, supporting the view that they are in the same family. Gavialids are large semiaquatic reptiles, resembling crocodiles, but with much thinner snouts. The thin snout is used to catch fish. Gavialids lack the jaw strength to capture the large mammalian prey favoured by crocodiles and alligators of similar size.  Taxonomy  The family Gavialidae was proposed by Arthur Adams in 1854 for reptiles with a very long and slender muzzle, webbed feet and nearly equal teeth. Taxonomists have proposed three different ways to fit Gavialidae members among Crocodilians: * Palaentologists refer to the broad lineage of gharial-like creatures using the term Gavialoidea. * If the three surviving groups of crocodilians are regarded as separate families, then the gharial is one of two members of the Gavialidae, which is related to the families Crocodylidae (crocodiles) and Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans). * Alternatively, the three groups are all classed together as the family Crocodylidae, but belong to the subfamilies Gavialinae, Crocodylinae, and Alligatorinae. = Genera = Family Gavialidae * Subfamily Gavialinae ** Genus ‚Ä†Eogavialis *** ‚Ä†Eogavialis africanus *** ‚Ä†Eogavialis andrewsi ** Genus Gavialis *** Gavialis gangeticus, gharial * Subfamily ‚Ä†Gryposuchinae ** Genus ‚Ä†Aktiogavialis ** Genus ‚Ä†Gryposuchus ** Genus ‚Ä†Hesperogavialis ** Genus ‚Ä†Ikanogavialis ** Genus ‚Ä†Piscogavialis ** Genus ‚Ä†Siquisiquesuchus In addition, molecular evidence indicates that the tomistomines belong to this group, although morphological evidence has been cited to place them in Crocodylidae: * Subfamily Tomistominae ** Genus ‚Ä†Gavialosuchus ** Genus ‚Ä†Kentisuchus ** Genus ‚Ä†Paratomistoma ** Genus ‚Ä†Rhamphosuchus ** Genus ‚Ä†Thecachampsa ** Genus Tomistoma *** ‚Ä†Tomistoma cairense *** ‚Ä†Tomistoma? lusitanicum *** Tomistoma schlegelii, false gharial or Malayan gharial ** Genus ‚Ä†Toyotamaphimeia = Species (Extant) = File:Gavialis gangeticus.jpgGharial (Gavialis gangeticus) File:Tomistoma schlegelii (2).jpgFalse gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) ‚Ä† Indicates extinct group  Phylogeny  The phylogeny of gharials is significantly impacted by homoplasy. These endangered reptiles are made up of two different species: Gavialis gangeticus and Tomistoma schlegelii. An important distinction between the two is that under morphological analysis of extant species and fossils, Tomistoma is considered a true crocodile, while Gavialis is not, with the two species' shared characteristic of fish eating being a product of homoplasy. However, molecular data suggests that the gharials are sister taxa, with their shared fish eating trait being a result of homology. Further complicating matters is molecular and morphological data suggesting that the genus of thoracosaurs emerged within the lineage of gharials, despite the fact that the now extinct thoracosaurs actually emerged much sooner than gharials. Lee and Yates conducted a study aiming to combine molecular and morphological methods in order to address this anomaly and distinguish which traits were due to homology, and which were due to homoplasy. They checked living and fossilized crocodiles for a comprehensive list of known traits, and created a supermatrix made up of 10 nuclear genes. The resulting data were analyzed by parsimony and tip dating methods. From their research, they confirmed that the two species of gharials were indeed sister taxa, meaning that the shared traits between Tomistoma and true crocodiles were a result of homoplasy. They also concluded that the only possible explanation for the data placing thoracosaurs within the gharial lineage was a significant amount of homoplastic convergence between thoracosaurs and Gavialis. Molecular studies consistently and unambiguously show the Gavialidae to be a sister group of the Crocodylidae to the exclusion of Alligatoridae, rendering Brevirostres paraphyletic and Gavialoidea perhaps polyphyletic. The clade including crocodiles and gharial has been suggested to be called Longirostres.

It is a member of the river dolphin group and the only one that lives in the ocean and saltwater estuaries, rather than inhabiting exclusively freshwater systems. Commercialized areas that create agricultural runoffs and/or industrialized zones can affect the health of the La Plata dolphin, especially in regards to their contributions of waste and pollution, which can lead to habitat degradation and poisoned food among other concerns. Taxonomy La Plata skull The La Plata dolphin is the only species in its genus and is often placed in its own family, the Pontoporiidae. It was first described by Paul Gervais and Alcide d'Orbigny in 1844 (the species epithet blainvillei commemorates the French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville). The La Plata dolphin is also widely known as the Franciscana - the Argentine and Uruguay a name that has been adopted internationally. Other common names are the toninha (the Brazilian name) and cachimbo. Description The La Plata dolphin has the longest beak (as a proportion of body size) of any cetacean -- as much as 15% in older adults. Males grow to and females to . The body is a greyish brown colour, with a lighter underside. The flippers are also very large in comparison with body size and are very broad, but narrow on joining the body, so are almost triangular in shape. The trailing edges are serrated. The crescent-shaped blowhole lies just in front of a crease in the neck, giving the impression that dolphin forever has its head cricked upwards. The dorsal fin has a long base and a rounded tip. The La Plata dolphin has homodont dentition with conical shaped teeth. The number of teeth range from 48 to 61 on each side of its upper and lower jaw. The La Plata dolphin weighs up to , and lives for up to 20 years. Sexual maturity is reached between two and three years. Females have a two-year reproductive cycle. Calves are 70 to 75 cm when born after a gestation of 10‚Äì11 months. Calves are weaned at a year old. Females may be giving birth by the age of five.  Reproduction  The La Plata dolphin reaches sexual maturity around two to three years for both sexes, but some populations have shown as long as five years. Although it is difficult to observe La Plata dolphins, the reproductive patterns of one population of La Plata near Brazil was studied extensively. A majority of the dolphins observed were born around September to February, during the austral spring and summer. La Plata dolphin has an average gestation period of about 11 months. Smaller testes indicate less importance of sperm competition when considering mating strategies, and La Plata dolphins generally have smaller testes. However, data reveals that the size of an individual's testes has seasonal variation which indicates their breeding season, but there is still research needed to further this observation. The size of La Plata testes in relation to their body mass may reveal that they primarily perform serial monogamy. This does not directly indicate that La Plata are purely monogamous, but that they may remain with one partner during a breeding season or a portion of that season. There is evidence that suggests that La Plata have a reproductive cycle of two years; however, more is required to make any legitimate claims.Rosas, FCW, and E. L. A. Monteiro-Filho. \\"Reproductive parameters of Pontoporia blainvillei (Cetacea, Pontoporiidae).\\" Behavior and feeding The animal is very inconspicuous--it moves very smoothly and slowly--and can be difficult to spot unless estuary conditions are very calm. It will commonly swim alone or in small groups. Exceptional groups as large as 15 have been seen. La Plata dolphins are bottom feeders and gut inspections have revealed they eat at least 24 different species of fish, depending on which species are most common. They will also take octopus, squid and shrimp. They are, in turn, hunted by killer whales (orcas) and several species of sharks. Range and habitat The La Plata dolphin is found in the coastal Atlantic waters of southeastern South America, including the R√≠o de la Plata estuary. Its distribution ranges from the Tropic of Capricorn near Ubatuba, Brazil, south to Pen√≠nsula Vald√©s, Argentina. It is the only member of the river dolphin group that lives in the ocean and saltwater estuaries, rather than freshwater. Although some members of the species do spend portions of their lives outside of river systems, many individuals live their entire lives within rivers, never venturing into the ocean proper. The species has been observed in Miramar, Buenos Aires Province, Rio Negro Province, Bahia Rosas swimming in small groups. Their reported range is from the opening of the Doce River, Regencia, Espirito Santo, Brasil to Peninsula Valdes in Chubut Province, Argentina.  Threats  The La Plata dolphin is affected by factors like habitat destruction and water pollution. Plastic debris and synthetic material has been found in the stomach contents of these animals. More research is necessary to determine whether or not these factors negatively affect the health of La Plata dolphins. 90% of the population in Guanabara Bay was lost in three decades.Dale J.. 2016. Popula√ß√£o de golfinhos da Ba√≠a de Guanabara sofre redu√ß√£o de 90% em tr√™s d√©cadas. Globo.com. Retrieved on Septem8er 18, 2017 La Plata also faces threats from fishing nets and other types of fishing gear that they get caught in while searching for prey. Commercialized areas often have agricultural runoff or industrial zones that are harmful to the species's health. Waste and pollution from these areas lead to habitat degradation and toxic chemicals in fish that dolphins feed on. Since the La Plata dolphin is a small mammal and their habitat is regularly hunted by sharks and killer whales, they are generally quiet in nature and inhabit shallow coastal waters. Conservation The La Plata dolphin is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the Franciscana is a particular conservation concern because of its restricted distribution and vulnerability to incidental capture in fishing gear. Large numbers are killed in gillnets. Although the largest documented catches in the 1970s were in Uruguay, catches in recent decades have also been high in southern Brazil and Argentina. Scientists from all three countries have voiced their concerns, and asked for international assistance in highlighting the plight of the dolphin (see Reeves et al., pg. 53). The species is listed on Appendix I\\"Appendix I and Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009. and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of its range. CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co- operation organised by tailored agreements. A young La Plata dolphin was rescued in 2011 off Montevideo, Uruguay. In February 2016 a young dolphin died on the beach of Santa Teresita, Argentina. Reports circulated internationally that the dolphin's death resulted after being passed around by a crowd who were posing for selfies with it. However, an interview by the photographer of the images, Hernan Coria, contradicted such claim.

The Ganges river dolphin is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, while the Indus river dolphin is now found only in the main channel of the Indus River in Pakistan and active channels connected to it between the Jinnah and Kotri barrages, and in the River Beas (a tributary of the Indus) in Punjab in India.Indus river dolphin. worldwildlife.org From the 1970s until 1998, they were regarded as separate species; however, in 1998, their classification was changed from two separate species to subspecies of a single species (see taxonomy below). The Ganges river dolphin has been recognized by the government of India as its National Aquatic Animal and is the official animal of the Indian city of Guwahati. The Indus river dolphin has been named as the National Mammal of Pakistan. Taxonomy and evolution The species was described independently by two authors, Lebeck and Roxburgh, both in 1801, and to whom the original description should be ascribed is unclear. Until the 1970s, the South Asian river dolphin was regarded as a single species. The two subspecies are geographically separate and have not interbred for many hundreds if not thousands of years. Based on differences in skull structure, vertebrae, and lipid composition scientists declared the two populations as separate species in the early 1970s. In 1998, the results of these studies were questioned and the classification reverted to the pre-1970 consensus of a single species containing two subspecies until the taxonomy could be resolved using modern techniques such as molecular sequencing. The latest analyses of mitochondrial DNA of the two populations did not display the variances needed to support their classification as separate species. Thus, at present, a single species with two subspecies is recognized in the genus Platanista, P. g. gangetica (Ganges river dolphin) and P. g. minor (Indus river dolphin). ;Synonyms * blind river dolphin, side-swimming dolphin * Ganges subspecies: Gangetic dolphin, Ganges susu,, page 451 [letter A] and page 568 [letter S]. shushuk * Indus subspecies: bhulan, Indus dolphin, Indus blind dolphin An assessment of divergence rates in mitochondrial DNA of the two subspecies indicates that they diverged from a common ancestor around 550,000 years ago. This ancestor is thought to have been a marine Platanistid inhabiting the epi- continental seas in South Asia during the sea level rises in the middle Miocene. The earliest fossil identified as belonging to the species is only 12,000 years old.  Description  The South Asian river dolphin has the long, pointed nose characteristic of all river dolphins. Their teeth are visible in both the upper and lower jaws even when the mouth is closed. The teeth of young animals are almost an inch long, thin and curved; however, as animals age, the teeth undergo considerable changes and in mature adults become square, bony, flat disks. The snout thickens towards its end. Navigation and hunting are carried out using echolocation. They are unique among cetaceans in that they swim on their sides. The body is a brownish color and stocky at the middle. The species has only a small, triangular lump in the place of a dorsal fin. The flippers and tail are thin and large in relation to the body size, which is about 2-2.2 meters in males and 2.4‚Äì2.6 m in females. The oldest recorded animal was a 28-year-old male, 199 cm in length. Mature females are larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is expressed after females reach about ; the female rostrum continues to grow after the male rostrum stops growing, eventually reaching approximately longer.Skull cast Biology Indus river dolphin, 1927 illustration = Life cycle = Museo di storia naturale e del territorio dell'Universit√† di Pisa Births may take place year round, but appear to be concentrated between December to January and March to May. Gestation is thought to be approximately 9‚Äì10 months. After around one year, juveniles are weaned and they reach sexual maturity at about 10 years of age. During the monsoon, South Asian river dolphins tend to migrate to tributaries of the main river systems. Occasionally, individuals swim along with their beaks emerging from the water, and they may \\"breach\\"; jumping partly or completely clear of the water and landing on their sides. =Diet= South Asian river dolphins rely on echolocation to find prey due to their poor eyesight. Their extended rostrum is advantageous in detecting hidden or hard- to-find prey items. The prey is held in their jaws and swallowed. Their teeth are used as a clamp rather than a chewing mechanism. The species feeds on a variety of shrimp and fish, including carp and catfish. The Ganges subspecies may take birds and turtles. They are usually encountered on their own or in loose aggregations; the dolphins do not form tight interacting groups. = Vision = The species lacks a crystalline eye lens and has evolved a flat cornea. The combination of these traits makes the eye incapable of forming clear images on the retina and renders the dolphin effectively blind, but the eye may still serve as a light receptor. The retina contains a densely packed receptor layer, a very thin bipolar and ganglion cell layer, and a tiny optic nerve (with only a few hundred optic fibers) that are sufficient for the retina to act as a light-gathering component. Although its eye lacks a lens (this species is also referred to as the \\"blind dolphin\\"), the dolphin still uses its eye to locate itself. The species has a slit similar to a blowhole on the top of the head, which acts as a nostril. The dense pigmentation in the skin overlying the eye prevents light from reaching the retina from any entrance except for a pinhole sphincter-like structure. This structure is controlled by a cone-shaped muscle layer that extends from the posterior eye orbit to the overlying eye skin layer. The sphincter-like structure is capable of sensing light and may be able to sense the direction from where the light was emitted. However, the muddy waters, or low light conditions, that P. gangetica inhabits negate the use of the little vision that remains. = Vocalization = The Ganges subspecies shows object-avoidance behavior in both the consistently heavily murky waters of its habitat and in clear water in captivity, suggesting it is capable of using echolocation effectively to navigate and forage for prey. However, information is limited on how extensively vocalization is used between individuals. This subspecies of river dolphin is capable of performing whistles, but rarely does so, suggesting that the whistle is a spontaneous sound and not a form of communication. The Ganges river dolphin most typically makes echolocation sounds such as clicks, bursts, and twitters. Produced pulse trains are similar in wave form and frequency to the echolocation patterns of the Amazon river dolphin. Both species regularly produce frequencies lower than 15 kHz and the maximum frequency is thought to fall between 15 and 60 kHz. Echolocation is also used for population counts by using acoustic surveying. This method is still being developed and is not heavily used due to cost and technical skill requirement. Distribution and habitat In Sundarbans, Bangladesh The South Asian river dolphins are native to the freshwater river systems located in Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. They can be most commonly found in water with high abundance of prey and reduced flow. They migrate seasonally‚Äîdownstream in colder conditions with lower water levels and upstream in warmer conditions with higher water levels. The Ganges subspecies (P. g. gangetica) can be found along the Ganges- Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Bangladesh and India, and the Sapta Koshi and Karnali Rivers in Nepal. A small subpopulation may still be found on the Ghaghara River, but requires verification. Being a mammal, the Ganges river dolphin cannot breathe in the water and must surface every 30‚Äì120 seconds. Because of the sound it produces when breathing, the animal is popularly referred to as the susu. The Ganges river dolphin favours deep pools, eddy countercurrents located downstream of the convergence of rivers and of sharp meanders, and upstream and downstream of midchannel islands. The Indus subspecies (P. g. minor) today only occurs in a 1,000-km stretch of the Indus River itself and several connecting channels between the Jinnah and Kotri barrages. In the past, it was to be found along 3,400 km of the Indus, its tributaries, and neighboring river systems. Its range has contracted by about 80% since 1870. Since the two originally inhabited river systems ‚Äì between the Sukkur and Guddu barrage in Pakistan's Sind Province, and in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provinces ‚Äì are not connected in any way, how they were colonized remains unknown. The river dolphins are unlikely to have travelled from one river to another through the sea route, since the two estuaries are very far apart. A possible explanation is that several north Indian rivers such as the Sutlej and Yamuna changed their channels in ancient times while retaining their dolphin populations. Conservation A 2017 population assessment estimated less than 5,000 individuals for the species as a whole, of which about 3,500 belong to the Ganges subspecies and about 1,500 to the Indus subspecies. However, the underlying surveys are temporally patchy and believed to contain uncertainty. Current population trends are unclear. A demonstrable increase in the main river population of the Indus subspecies between 1974 and 2008 may have been driven by permanent immigration from upstream tributaries, where the species no longer occurs. International trade is prohibited by the listing of the South Asian river dolphin on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It is protected under the Indian Wildlife Act, although these legislations require stricter enforcement. Both subspecies are listed by the IUCN as endangered on their Red List of Threatened Species. The Indus river dolphin is listed as endangered by the US government National Marine Fisheries Service under the Endangered Species Act. The species is listed on Appendix I\\"Appendix I and Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals as amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008, effective: 5 March 2009. and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The Ministry of Environment and Forest declared the Gangetic dolphin the national aquatic animal of India. A stretch of the Ganges River between Sultanganj and Kahlgaon in Bihar has been declared a dolphin sanctuary and named Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, the first such protected area. The Uttar Pradesh government in India is propagating ancient Hindu texts in hopes of raising the community support to save the dolphins from disappearing. One of the lines being versed from Valimiki's Ramayan, highlighted the force by which the Ganges emerged from Lord Shivji's locks and along with this force came many species such as animals, fish, and the Shishumaar‚Äîthe dolphin. Human interaction Gangetic dolphin, 1894 book illustration Both subspecies have been adversely affected by human use of river systems in South Asia. Entanglement in fishing nets as bycatch can cause significant damage to local populations, and individuals are taken each year by hunters; their oil and meat are used as a liniment, as an aphrodisiac, and as bait for catfish. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also be a contributing factor towards population decline, as these chemicals are biomagnified in the bodies of the dolphins. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which dolphins can breed. An immediate danger for the Ganges subspecies in National Chambal Sanctuary is the decrease in river depth and appearance of sand bars dividing the river course into smaller segments, as irrigation has lowered water levels throughout their range. = Nonhuman personhood = On 20 May 2013, India's Ministry of Environment and Forests declared dolphins ‚Äònonhuman persons‚Äô and as such has forbidden their captivity for entertainment purposes; keeping dolphins in captivity must satisfy certain legal prerequisites. = Project Dolphin = On the occasion of the 74th Independence Day, 15 August 2020, the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change announced 'Project Dolphin' to boost conservation of both river and oceanic dolphins.

The third creation is extant and is held by a member of the Anson family. History =Earls of Lichfield, first creation (1645)= The first creation, in the Peerage of England, was in December 1645 by King Charles I for his 4th cousin Charles Stewart (1639‚Äì1672), whose youngest uncle Lord Bernard Stewart (1623-26 September 1645) (youngest son of Esm√© Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox), had been due to be created Earl of Lichfield by Charles I for his actions at the battles of Newbury and Naseby but died aged 22 in the Battle of Rowton Heath before the creation could be implemented. Charles Stewart, the son of Bernard's elder brother George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny (who had been killed at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642), was in his place created Earl of Lichfield in December 1645. In 1660 the 1st Earl succeeded his infant first cousin, Esm√© Stuart, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 5th Duke of Lennox (1649-1660) in his titles and thus became also 3rd Duke of Richmond and 6th Duke of Lennox.Money 1881, pp. 187‚Äì188 In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661, following the Restoration of the Monarchy, he was invested by King Charles II with the Order of the Garter.Dictionary of National Biography, p. 73 He married three times, but produced no surviving male issue, being the last in the male line of Stewart of Aubigny, much beloved cousins of the Stewart monarchs. One of his wives was Frances Teresa Stuart, the celebrated beauty and alleged former mistress of King Charles II. In disgrace with the king, Charles was sent into exile as ambassador to Denmark, where he drowned on 12 December 1672. All of the English and Scottish titles that descended in the male line became extinct. The titles of Richmond and Lennox (which had merged into the crown in 1485 and 1586 respectively) and Aubigny, were re-granted by King Charles II (with the cooperation of the French King) to his last mistress Louise de K√©rouaille, 1st Duchesse d'Aubigny, and her illegitimate issue by him, namely Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox, whose descendants survive today at Goodwood House in Sussex. =Earls of Lichfield, second creation (1674)= Ditchley House, the seat of the Lee family and current home of the Ditchley Foundation The second creation, in the Peerage of England, came in 1674 when King Charles II bestowed the titles of Baron Spelsbury, Viscount Quarendon and Earl of Lichfield upon Sir Edward Lee, 5th Baronet, of Quarendon (1663‚Äì1716) in anticipation of his marriage to the king's illegitimate daughter Charlotte Fitzroy, whose mother was Barbara Villiers. The wedding took place in 1677. The Lee baronetcy, of Quarendon in Buckinghamshire, had been created in the Baronetage of England in 1611 for Henry Lee. He was the cousin and heir of Henry Lee of Ditchley. The 1st Earl of Lichfield from the Lee family was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, George Henry Lee, who became the 2nd Earl and 6th Baronet. He constructed the stately home of Ditchley in Oxfordshire. On his death the titles passed to his son George Henry Lee, the 3rd Earl. He represented Oxfordshire in the House of Commons and served as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners from 1762 to 1772. He died childless and was succeeded by his grand-uncle Robert, the 4th Earl. He was also childless. On his death in 1776 all his titles became extinct. =Earls of Lichfield, third creation (1831)= Shugborough Hall, the seat of the Anson family The third creation, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, came in William IV's coronation honours of 1831 in favour of Thomas Anson, 2nd Viscount Anson (1795‚Äì1854), a landowner and Whig politician from the Anson family who served as Master of the Buckhounds from 1830 to 1834 and as Postmaster General from 1835 to 1841. The 1st Earl was the eldest son of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson, who on 17 February 1806 had been created Baron Soberton, of Soberton in the County of Southampton, and Viscount Anson, of Shugborough and Orgreave in the County of Stafford, both in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Also in 1831, the 1st Earl's cousin William Anson was made a baronet (see Anson Baronets). The earldom of Lichfield continued to descend within the Anson family from father to son until the death of the 4th Earl, in 1960. He was succeeded by his grandson, the 5th Earl, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (1913‚Äì1958), eldest son of the 4th Earl. Known professionally as Patrick Lichfield, he was a successful photographer. the titles are held by the 6th Earl, only son of the 5th Earl and Lady Leonora Grosvenor, daughter of the 5th Duke of Westminster. He succeeded as the 6th Earl of Lichfield upon his father's death on 11 November 2005. The 6th Earl married in December 2009 Lady Henrietta Conyngham, daughter of Henry Conyngham, 8th Marquess Conyngham.The Times announcement They have one son, Thomas Ossian Patrick Wolfe Anson, Viscount Anson (b. 20 May 2011). The courtesy title of the eldest son and heir apparent of the Earl is Viscount Anson. The family seat of the Anson earls of Lichfield is Shugborough Hall, Staffordshire, which is about 15 miles from the city of Lichfield. Admiral Anson, the 1st Earl of Lichfield and others are buried at St Michael and All Angels Church in Colwich, a short distance from Shugborough Hall. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Earl and other Ansons of Shugborough after 1854 were buried in the churchyard of St Stephen's Church in Great HaywoodMemorial Inscriptions of Great Haywood, Staffordshire: St Stephen's Churchyard, accessed 1 October 2012 until the 5th Earl decided to return to the Anson vault at Colwich. He was buried there in 2005.

For this purpose it was occupied by the Army of the Holy War led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, the commander of the Jerusalem Hills sector.Morris, 2008, p. 123 The village was assaulted by the Palmach's Harel Brigade and two squads of the Haganah during Operation Nachshon, after a previous minor clash had already caused most civilian inhabitants to flee.Morris, 2004, pp. 234‚Äì235. Palmach troops occupied the village on April 3, but its commander was refused permission to blow up the houses. Forces under Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni attacked and besieged the Haganah-held village on 7 April 1948. During the following, foggy night Al-Husayni himself was killed by a Haganah sentinel in a bizarre incident. On April 8, armed Arabs from the entire area, motivated by the disappearance of their leader, attacked and recaptured al-Qastal. However, Al-Husayni's death is said to have led to a loss of morale among his forces.Morris, 2008, p. 125 Most fighters left their positions to attend al-Husayni's funeral at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Friday, April 9.

A tram stop, tram station, streetcar stop, or light rail station is a place designated for a tram, streetcar, or light rail vehicle to stop so passengers can board or alight it. Generally, tram stops share most characteristics of bus stops, but because trams operate on rails, they often include railway platforms, especially if stepless entries are provided for accessibility. However, trams may also be used with bus stop type flags and with mid-street pavements as platforms, in street running mode.  Examples  Most tram or streetcar stops in Melbourne and Toronto and other systems with extensive sections of street-running have no associated platforms, with stops in the middle of the roadway pavement. In most jurisdictions, traffic cannot legally pass a tram or streetcar whose doors are open, unless the tram is behind a safety zone or has a designated platform. On the other hand, several light rail systems have high-platform stops or stations with dedicated platforms at railway platform height. Reasons for this include systems being created from former heavy rail routes (as in the case of the Metrolink system in Greater Manchester, England), or to provide a more rapid transit-like commuting experience (such as the Metro Rail system in Los Angeles, California). Such trams also stop at dedicated platform stops on Stadtbahn systems in Germany, especially in underground stations in city centres. Not all tram stops are served full-time. In the 1920s, Toronto created Sunday stops in addition to regular stops along its streetcar routes. Sunday stops were only used on a Sunday and, with few exceptions, were always near a Christian church. There were also a few Sunday stops near subway stations that were usable only before 9 am, the Sunday opening time of the subway system. However, the Toronto Transit Commission decided to close all Sunday stops on June 7, 2015. The TTC found that Sunday stops slow down streetcars making it more difficult to maintain schedules. Also, Sunday stops were also unfair to non-Christian places of worship which never had the equivalent of a Sunday stop. By 2015, most Sunday stops were along current and former streetcar routes. The design of tram stops have seen many recent innovations; the Dubai Tram, which opened on 12 November 2014, became the world's first tram system to feature platform screen doors at its tram stops.

It lies east of Bristol, west of London and east of The Cotswolds AONB. The town was established on a crossing of the River Avon and some form of settlement is believed to have existed there since before Roman times. It was a royal vill, and probably a royal hunting lodge, under Alfred the Great. The town continued to grow when the Great Western Railway arrived in 1841; it is now a major commuter town. Chippenham is twinned with La Fl√®che in France and Friedberg in Germany. The town's motto is \\"Unity and Loyalty\\". Geography =Location= Chippenham is in western Wiltshire, at a prominent crossing of the River Avon, between the Marlborough Downs to the east, the southern Cotswolds to the north and west and Salisbury Plain to the southeast. The town is surrounded by sparsely populated countryside and there are several woodlands in or very near the town, such as Bird's Marsh, Vincients Wood and Briars Wood. =Suburbs= Suburbs include Cepen Park (North & South), Hardenhuish, Monkton, Lowden, Pewsham, Primrose Hill, Englands, Frogwell, Derriads, The Folly, Redland, Queens Crescent, Lackham, Fenway Park, and Hill Rise, loosely corresponding to local government wards. =Transport= British Railways \\"totem\\" sign for Chippenham station. Brunel's railway viaduct Chippenham lies south of the M4 motorway, which links the town to Bristol, Swindon, South Wales and London. The A4 former coach road, A420 and B4069 provide further road links to Bath, Bristol and Oxford. The town is bypassed to the west by the A350, which links the M4 motorway with Chippenham and nearby towns to the south, such as Melksham, Warminster and Trowbridge. The A4 national route crosses the southern part of the town, linking Chippenham to nearby Corsham, Calne, and Bath. In November 2019, the government approved an eastern extension linking the A4 to the A350 north of Cepen Park. Chippenham has a bus station with several routes and companies serving it. These include Stagecoach West with the route 55 to Swindon, Faresaver with the X31 to Bath, X34 to Trowbridge and Frome, 33 to Devizes as well as several local routes, and Coachstyle with the 92 to Malmesbury. First Bus also operate a small number of late evening buses on the X31 route. A smaller secondary bus station is located at Town Bridge, which serves as a hub for short routes within the town, as well as National Express coach services for destinations including Bristol, London, Northampton, Oxford, and the South West. Chippenham railway station is on the Great Western Main Line and is served by services between London Paddington and the West Country via Bristol Temple Meads or , and is famous for its railway arches and other buildings engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as part of the Great Western Railway development. It is served by main line services and a smaller service to via Melksham, Westbury and Salisbury. It is now mostly electrified to make train times faster from London to the West Country (less than an hour from Paddington), the Chippenham to Bath and Bristol section having been indefinitely deferred in 2016. =Landmarks= The Buttercross today The original Buttercross, a stone structure, was erected in c. 1570 and stood at the centre of the Shambles at the current location of Barclays Bank. It was used for the sale of meat and dairy products. In 1889, Mr E.C. Lowndes bought the structure for ¬£6 and re-erected it as a gazebo in the kitchen garden of the manor house at Castle Combe, where it fell into disrepair. The Buttercross was re-erected in 1995 by the Chippenham Civic Society, funded by many local people and organisations.From the inscription on the Buttercross. It currently stands as the centre-piece of the pedestrianised area of the town centre, where a market is held each Friday and Saturday. The Yelde Hall is one of very few remaining medieval timber framed buildings in the town. It originally was divided internally for use as a market hall. Both the hall and its meeting room upstairs were used by the burgess and bailiff for a variety of meetings and trials as well as for Council meetings. The space under the Council Chamber was used as the town gaol. Town arms from 1776 on the Yelde Hall =Bird's Marsh= Bird's Marsh is a woodland of about , to the north of the town. It is home to many kinds of wildlife, and a popular place for walkers, due to its fairly large size and surrounding countryside. One way into Bird's Marsh is through a field close to the Morrisons supermarket, just south of the roundabout on the A350 (Malmesbury Road). There are also access points off Hill Corner Road (via fields) and Jacksom's Lane. Although not actually a marsh, the ground can be very boggy off the well- marked paths; this has protected the area from housing development. In 2008, developers made a planning inquiry about building 800 homes around the Bird's Marsh area. In 2012, developers won the right to build on this area, despite fierce opposition from resident groups. In 2013, after nearly five years of campaigning, the protesters achieved partial success when the woodland and a field were granted village green status. =Climate= Population and demography Population of Chippenham 1801‚Äì2018 (2011‚Äì2018 estimate in red) Chippenham's population grew rapidly in the 1990s, from 25,376 in 1991 to 28,065 at the 2001 census, an increase of 11%. This reflected the development of large housing estates (indeed, entirely new suburbs) such as Cepen Park to the west of the town, and the Pewsham development to the east (named for the small village of Pewsham, further east). By 2007 the figure had reached 34,820. Additional housing developments took place, but on a smaller scale. In 2011, the town's population was 45,337, making it the largest in Wiltshire with the exception of Swindon (which is no longer within the administrative county of Wiltshire), and also larger than the city of Salisbury. Estimates in 2018 by the Office for National Statistics gave a small increase to 45,620 and put Trowbridge in first place at 45,822. Trend-based projections for 2026 indicate a population of 49,340. The 2011 census also gave information on the demographic makeup of the town. Around 92.1% of the town's population are categorised as White British, making Chippenham more ethnically diverse than Wiltshire as a whole (93.4% White British), but less diverse than the wider South West (91.8% White British). History =Etymology= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the town as Cippanhamme: this could refer to Cippa who had his Hamm, an enclosure in a river meadow. An alternative theory suggests that the name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word ceap, meaning market. The name is recorded variously as Cippanhamm (878), Cepen (1042), Cheppeham (1155), Chippenham (1227), Shippenham (1319) and Chippyngham (1541). In John Speed's map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt both \\"Chippenham\\" (for the hundred) and \\"Chipnam\\" (for the town). (There is another Chippenham, Cambridgeshire as well as Cippenham, Berkshire near Slough.) From Chapman's harbour. It might share toponomy with Copenhagen (K√∏benhavn ‚Äì \\"Market harbour\\". Older name: K√∏pmann√¶hafn, \\"Chapman's Harbour\\" ). In Swedish, K√∂penhamn (pronounced \\"Shopenham\\"). In Norwegian, Kj√∏penhavn (Pronounced \\"Shiopenhavn\\") =Earliest settlement= There are believed to have been settlements in the Chippenham region since before Roman times. Remains of Romano-British settlements are visible in the wall behind the former magistrates' court and recent redevelopments of the town have shown up other evidence of early settlements. =Early Medieval= The town (not counting the Roman villages now within its boundaries) is believed to have been founded by Anglo-Saxons around AD 600. In AD 853, √Üthelswith (sister to Alfred the Great) married King Burgred of Mercia at Chippenham. Alfred was then a boy of four and the wedding was held on the site of St Andrew's church. According to Bishop Asser's Life of King Alfred, Chippenham was, under Alfred's reign, a royal vill; historians have also argued, from its proximity to the royal forests at Melksham and Barden, that it was probably a hunting lodge. Alfred's daughter was also married in Chippenham. Danish Vikings successfully besieged Chippenham in 878. Later that year, at the Battle of Ethandun, Alfred decisively defeated the Danes, whose forces then surrendered to Alfred at Chippenham (ushering in the establishment of the Danelaw). In 1042, the Royal holding in Chippenham makes mention of a church. The Domesday Book listed Chippenham as \\"Cepen\\", with a population of 600 to 700 in 1086. =High and Late Medieval= In Norman times, the royal properties were separated into the manors of Sheldon, Rowden and Lowden. Records show that the town expanded into Langstret (now the Causeway) from 1245, and from 1406 into Le Newstret (now the New Road area of town). Throughout this period, Chippenham continued to have a thriving market in the town centre. A map of Chippenham from 1773 The A4 that runs through Chippenham incorporates parts of the 14th-century medieval road network that linked London to Bristol. This was an important road for the English cloth trade, and so its upkeep was funded in part by Bristol cloth merchants. Chippenham was represented in the Parliament of England from 1295, and Queen Mary granted the town a Charter of Incorporation in 1554. Analysis of the wood used to build the Yelde Hall indicates that the market hall was built around 1450. The Shambles and Buttercross were built after 1570. The Shambles were destroyed in a fire in 1856 but the Yelde Hall survived. The parish of Chippenham Without encompasses the deserted medieval village of Sheldon, devastated by plague; all that remains today is Sheldon Manor, Wiltshire's oldest inhabited manor house, dating from 1282. =16th to 18th centuries= The wool industry took off in the 16th century, partly due to the river. The plague hit the town hard in 1611 and 1636. This, a recession in the woollen industry, and a drop in corn production in 1622 and 1623, caused massive hardship for the town's population. The trade in cloth faced further problems during the English Civil War due to a Royalist proclamation that prohibited the sale of cloth to the Parliamentarian-controlled London. In 1747, a bribery and corruption scandal (involving two members of parliament for Chippenham) led to the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole's government. OS map of Chippenham from 1896 =19th and 20th centuries= A branch to Chippenham off the Wilts & Berks Canal was built in 1798, terminating at a wharf at Timber Street near the marketplace; the main commodity traded was coal. The site of the wharf is now the town's bus station, and part of Pewsham Way follows the line of the branch. The Great Western Railway arrived in Chippenham in 1841, and in turn attracted many new businesses. The arrival of these businesses required new housing which led to the expansion of the town into land north of the railway, which in turn led to the growth of further industries to support the building work. An OS map of Chippenham from 1946 The arrival of the railway promoted the growth of industrial agricultural businesses. In the middle of the 19th century, Chippenham was a major centre for the production of dairy and ham products; this led, later, to Nestl√© and Matteson's having factories in the town centre. The railway also led to the growth of railway engineering works in Chippenham: the first of these was Roland Brotherhood in 1842. A variety of companies then took over part or all of the business on the site, until in 1935 Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd took over the site fully. The signalling side of the business remains at the Chippenham site and is now owned by Siemens Rail Automation Group; the brakes business was taken over by the German company Knorr-Bremse, and is in nearby Melksham. On 17 April 1960, American singers Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, and songwriter Sharon Sheeley, were involved in a car crash in Chippenham at Rowden Hill. Cochran died as a result of his injuries and a memorial plaque was erected near the site. On 13 February 1998, two unexploded bombs from World War II were discovered in the field behind Hardens Mead during preparations for the building of Abbeyfield School. About 1,100 residents in the east of Chippenham had to be evacuated for two nights until the army carried out a controlled explosion. The Army initially tried to defuse the larger device, but it was decided that owing to the bomb's orientation in the ground this would be too dangerous. Governance Coat of arms of the Chippenham The offices of North Wiltshire District Council were based in the town until 2009, when the council was merged with four other Wiltshire local authorities. The offices in Monkton Park were taken over by the replacement unitary Wiltshire Council, which is based in Trowbridge. The office of Town Mayor was established in 1835, before which Chippenham was governed by a Bailiff supported by Burgesses. Currently elected annually by the Town Council, the Mayor is generally appointed to office in May each year, at the \\"Mayor Making\\" ceremony. As part of their duties as the first citizen of a town, the Mayor visits organisations, charities and groups representing all parts of the local community, acting as a figurehead to promote goodwill, cultural exchange, trade and commerce. The Mayor also nominates a specific charity which they will support throughout their year of office. Other tasks include presiding over Town council meetings and acting as President of various local organisations, such as the Twinning Association and the Sea Cadets. In 2013, Councillor Sylvia Gibson became the 30th Mayor of Chippenham. In 1812, Sir Robert Peel, the creator of the modern police force, served as MP for Chippenham. Until 2010, the town of Chippenham was within the parliamentary constituency of North Wiltshire, traditionally a Conservative stronghold, although in the 19th century some Liberal members were elected. Boundary changes for the 2010 general election saw Liberal Democrat candidate Duncan Hames become the new Member of Parliament for Chippenham, a newly created constituency formed from parts of three neighbouring constituencies. In 2015 Chippenham was won by the Conservatives, and its MP is now Michelle Donelan. Economy Wilko, left foreground) Historically a market town, Chippenham's economy has since changed to that of a commuter town with residents travelling to workplaces in Bath, Bristol, Swindon and even London (almost 100 miles to the east). Several large businesses have been located in the region, with the biggest former employer being Westinghouse, now owned by Siemens, whose factory complex lies next to the railway station. The company undertakes railway signalling contracts for Network Rail, London Underground as well as railway operators in other parts of the world, e.g. Beijing Subway, Oslo Public Transport Administration, SMRT Corporation, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, MTR Corporation and many others. Parts of the Westinghouse site are occupied by a range of companies. There are a number of other industrial sites around the town, Bumpers Farm being the largest. In 2005, Wincanton PLC, Europe's second-largest logistics organisation, consolidated its head office operations and moved to the newly developed Methuen Park office development in west Chippenham, where it employs around 350 people. =Market= Chippenham is a market town, with street markets taking place every Friday and Saturday around Market Place and along the High Street. A Farmers' Market for the sale of fresh, locally produced foodstuffs is also held here once a fortnight. The original Cattle Market, which closed in 2004, is now being redeveloped by Linden Homes Western Limited as one of the UK's largest eco-housing projects. =Shopping= Chippenham's main retail area surrounds the High Street (which is closed to traffic during the day) and the Market Place. Two shopping centres lie on either side of the High Street: the enclosed Emery Gate Shopping Centre and the open-air Borough Parade, with a medium-sized Tesco and a small Waitrose respectively. In and around the High Street, there are very few independent shops as franchises dominate; there are some independent shops along The Causeway and in the Upper Market Place. Retail parks, such as the Hathaway Retail Park, Bath Road Retail Park and the Chippenham Retail Park (Bumpers Way), are towards the edge of town and contain larger superstores and fast-food outlets. The Chippenham Co-operative Society was founded in 1890. Over the years, it played an increasing role in the local economy, becoming deeply involved in agriculture and dairy farming, and for most of the 20th century its department store dominated the lower end of the High Street. However, by the 1960s, the business was facing increasing competition and found it necessary to join forces with other co-operatives, first locally, then nationally, forming The Co-operative Group. In the 1980s, this flagship store was sold and became a Wilko branch, but the Co-operative Group diversified into other areas, such as insurance and funeral services, which still operate through many local branches. Tourism Surrounding the town are a number of stone-built villages, including Lacock (National Trust), Biddestone, Bremhill, and Castle Combe. The great house and art treasures of Longleat, Bowood House, Lacock Abbey, Sheldon Manor and Corsham Court are within easy reach. Chippenham Museum and Heritage Centre is in the town centre and tells the story of the market town. =Twinned towns= Chippenham is twinned with La Fl√®che in France Archived at Wayback Machine and Friedberg in Germany. La Fl√®che lies on the banks of the Loir, from Le Mans and from Tours. Set amongst woods and farmland, La Fl√®che has various recreational facilities including a zoological park. Le Prytane Militaire public school dates back to the time of King Henry IV of France, and La Fl√®che has the status of a University Town. In 1630, people from La Fl√®che founded Montreal in Canada. Friedberg is from Munich and the Bavarian Alps. Duke Ludwig the severe and his nephew Conradin founded the town in 1264. The town hall follows the architectural style of Elias Holl's Town Hall, built in 1674, in neighbouring Augsburg. Friedberg is a walled town, with many sporting and cultural events such as the 17th century Street Festival. Culture Chippenham Folk festival The Chippenham Folk Festival takes place every year, usually over the Whitsuntide weekend. There is an annual festival in remembrance of American rock and roll singer Eddie Cochran, who died on 17 April 1960 following a car accident in Chippenham on his way back to London during a tour. From 1963, the Town Museum was housed in the Yelde Hall. By 2000, it had outgrown the site and moved to the former Magistrates' Court in the Market Place. The museum charts the history of the town from Neolithic times until today. By 2005, the museum had attracted over 90,000 visitors. Sport and leisure Chippenham Sports Club Pavilion Chippenham is well served with sports clubs and leisure facilities. The Olympiad Centre opened in 1989, replacing an outdoor pool which had closed in 1988. It caters for a wide range of interests and has a variety of swimming pools and full gym facilities. It also hosts events including the popular annual CAMRA Beer Festival. Chippenham Sports Club, on the A420 Bristol Road, is a members' sports club. Its facilities include a two-storey pavilion that overlooks the six hard-surface floodlit tennis courts and the cricket square and field. The all-weather hockey pitches are used by ladies' and men's teams. The Dome, an inflatable, all year round, indoor sports dome, provides amenities including netball, cricket nets and a five-a- side football league. Chippenham Town Bowls Club, with its own pavilion, is on the same site. The town is home to Chippenham Town F.C.. They were formed in 1873, and most notably played in the FA Vase 2000 Final, when they lost 1‚Äì0 to Deal Town F.C. They currently play in the National League South. Chippenham United F.C., formed in 1905, played for twelve seasons in the Wiltshire Football League after World War II, but folded in 1962. Chippenham Rugby Club is on the western outskirts alongside the A350 bypass. Chippenham Golf Club is situated on the A350 as it leads north from the town towards the M4. The club, formed in 1896, has a new clubhouse and redeveloped course opened in 2012. Chippenham has a small cinema, the Reel Astoria, on the A420 Marshfield Road, to the west of the town centre. The Sustrans National Cycle Network Route 403 passes through the town. There is a variety of nightlife in the town, including nightclubs, wine bars, and a mixture of modern and traditionally styled pubs. Education =17th and 18th centuries= In his will of 1661, Richard Scott directed that his house in Cooke's Street should be used as a school, and William Woodruffe gave an annuity of ¬£5 in 1664 for the teaching of ten poor boys. In 1713 the school was reopened with a benefaction of ¬£10 per annum for 24 boys. =Late 19th century= From 1875 a private venture grammar school existed in Chippenham, conducted in St Mary Street by Mr Wilson and from 1883 by Mr Cruikshank. In 1891, the Technical Instruction Acts (1889 & 1891) provided financial assistance for evening classes in various science and arts subjects. Earlier voluntary classes were now coordinated, and this became the beginning of a national system of technical education. Subjects included Shorthand, Animal Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, Hygiene, Carpentry and Dressmaking. In 1893, Edward Newall Tuck was appointed by the Education Committee of the Borough of Chippenham to organise technical classes in Chippenham and district. Classes were held in rented premises at No. 21 London Road and at the Jubilee Institute, as well as in villages including Grittleton and Yatton Keynell. Teachers from elementary schools attended classes in a School of Art on Saturdays at the Jubilee Institute. Mr Tuck, in addition, gave talks on Wiltshire history and nature study; he also served as town councillor and was Mayor of Chippenham from 1931 to 1932. In 1894, pupils were not admitted to classes until they reached the age of 11. Pupils from day schools were admitted free from age 11 to 16. The fees at this time were fixed at 6d per month, the whole expenses of the school being met by fees and grants from the Science and Art Department and the County Council. Higher grade classes for boys, including Woodwork and Chemistry, were held at No. 21 London Road. In 1896, under the provisions of the Technical and Industrial Institutions Act (1892), the Borough of Chippenham established the Chippenham and District County School, subsequently known as the Chippenham County Secondary School for Boys and Girls, with Mr Tuck as the first headmaster (he remained in this post until 1939). The first Chair of Governors was former mayor Alderman John Coles. The premises were still located at No. 21 London Road and the Jubilee Institute. As the tenancy of the private venture school was to end on 25 March 1896, the Town Council paid Mr Cruikshank ¬£10 for the desks, books and goodwill of his school. Boys were drawn from three elementary schools in Chippenham: the British, National and St. Paul's Schools. In addition twelve boys had previously attended the private grammar school. Others were from other private schools in Chippenham, Corsham, Devizes, Calne and surrounding villages. There were 39 boys aged 11 to 16 on the admission register from 13 April 1896. The curriculum included Latin, French, science, history, geography, grammar, bookkeeping, shorthand, arithmetic, writing, geometry and freehand drawing. In September 1898, a girls' school was established, against some opposition, in the Temperance Hall, Foghamshire; 22 girls were admitted at opening, from the schools of Mrs Parry (Market Place), Miss Alexander (Monkton Hill), Mrs White (Marshfield Road), from private tuition and from local National and British schools. =20th century= On 24 September 1900, the Chippenham District County School opened in Cocklebury Lane, now part of Wiltshire College (built on an acre of land purchased in 1896 by the county, Urban and Rural District Councils). The ceremony was attended by the Mayor and Aldermen of Chippenham. In addition to Mr Edward Newall Tuck as headmaster, the staff included three masters and one mistress; there were 99 pupils. The total cost of the project was ¬£6,000. In addition to the buildings and playground, four acres of adjoining land were rented for playing fields. All day classes were consolidated here and pupil numbers increased rapidly. On 1 May 1901 the Governors decided that the school should become a Science School. Four scholarships were granted (to three girls and one boy). In July it was decided to establish a centre for pupil-teachers at the school. In 1902, local education authorities were established and Wiltshire County Council became responsible for education in Chippenham. Latin was omitted from the curriculum. By 1904 there were 101 pupils: 50 from urban and 51 from rural areas. In addition 49 pupil teachers were attending, 9 from urban and the remainder from rural schools, and the evening classes had 139 pupils. From 1905 girls from elementary schools attended Cookery classes at the Cocklebury Road site. By October 1907 the school had 128 pupils: 64 boys and 64 girls. The age of admission was 9, and the leaving age 17 to 18. In addition to the yearly fees paid by pupils, the school was financed by County and Government grants. In 1908 the fees were five guineas a year, including books. However, there were a number of scholarships available and figures for the year show that of 115 pupils (66 girls and 49 boys), 57 held scholarships, one a \\"free place\\", and only 57 were fee-payers. In 1922, the school received further County and Government grants. In the inter-war years, numbers of pupils on roll increased steadily, and by 1929 there were 262. The Junior department was reorganised as a Kindergarten and Preparatory Form, catering for 61 children aged 8 to 10. However, the number of pupils over the age of 16 was proportionally small in comparison with the average for Wiltshire Grammar Schools, and so there was no separate sixth form, although a few pupils did go on to university, some with the aid of County Scholarships. By the early 1930s the buildings were overcrowded, and by 1935 pupil numbers had reached 288. Wiltshire County Council purchased Hardenhuish Park from the Clutterbuck family to satisfy the educational requirements of the growing town. In 1938, the Secondary Grammar School moved from Cocklebury Road to new buildings (since demolished) on the east side of Hardenhuish House. The old Manor House became the headmaster's room, the school library and some classrooms. The new school extended over 40 acres (16 hectares) of Hardenhuish Park; new buildings contained a hall, gymnasium, laboratories, classrooms, and cloakrooms. In 1939, the Preparatory department closed. By 1940 there were 414 pupils, of whom 25 were evacuees. 10% were under the age of 11 and, still, only 2% over 16. The Cocklebury Road premises became Chippenham County Secondary Modern School, a senior mixed school taking children aged 11 and over from the primary schools of Chippenham and district. =Modern= The nearest university is the Bath campus at Claverton Down, situated 12 miles to the west of Chippenham. Tertiary Wiltshire College, the successor to Chippenham Technical College, has a campus (built in 2015) on Cocklebury Road. Secondary Three secondary schools cater for students from age 11 through sixth form. * Hardenhuish School, Hardenhuish Lane has been an Academy since September 2010.

St Andrew's church, viewed from the Market Place =Church of England= * St Andrew's parish church is believed to have been built on the site of an Anglo-Saxon church. Many features of the present church are Norman (with the chancel arch being completed in c.1120). The spire was completed in 1633 although the 8 bells currently present were not added until 1734, and the back-lit clock and chimes in 1858. The organ has a case front dating from the 18th century. The church registers date from 1578. There was a Victorian era restoration of the interior of the church in 1875‚Äì1878 and again in the 1990s. St Paul's church * St. Nicholas church was built in 1779 and replaced an older medieval church that had previously stood on the same Hardenhuish site. The church was designed by John Wood, the Younger of Bath.

Since the late 1970s, he has published books, articles, and other contributions on a wide array of subjects. He has even set up his own media outfits, magazines, and podcasts. He is known for helping to develop the socioeconomic theory of participatory economics. Biography Albert was born in New York City, New York and grew up in New Rochelle, New York. In 1965, Albert was studying physics at MIT. He objected to the US military's funding of the university. This, along with the civil rights movement, led Albert to become politically active. He became a member of Students for a Democratic Society and opposed the Vietnam War. He was expelled from MIT, in January 1970, for disruptive behaviour, although he claimed the charges were 'cooked-up'. Albert founded South End Press in 1977 along with Lydia Sargent and Juliet Schor, among others. In 1987, Albert founded Zeta Magazine with Sargent. The magazine focused on libertarian and anarchist socialist thought. It was renamed Z Magazine in 1989. In 1990‚Äì91, Albert and Robin Hahnel worked on outlining their ideas around participatory economics. They published Looking Forward and The Political Economy of Participatory Economics, with the later including an economic model of the system. Doug Brown, writing in the Journal of Economic Issues said their alternative to markets was novel, but mainly of academic interest. By 1995, the organisation Z Magazine had branched out providing online content and media training. Along with the magazine the ventures are collectively known as Z Communications. In 2003, Parecon: Life After Capitalism was published further outlining participatory economics in a more accessible, less academic format. The book was translated into 20 languages. Reviewing the book Paul Ormerod felt Albert's criticisms of capitalism were unfounded. Albert spoke at the World Social Forum in the same year. He spoke at European Social Forum in 2004. Albert was a founding member of the International Organization for a Participatory Society, in 2012. Sean Michael Wilson created a comic book based on Albert and his ideas in 2013. Beliefs Albert identifies himself as a market abolitionist and believes markets should be replaced with participatory economics. Criticism In 2006, David Schweickart wrote a detailed critique of participatory economics called Nonsense on Stilts: Michael Albert's Parecon. He claimed three fundamental features of the economic system are flawed.

Pendolino (from Italian pendolo \\"pendulum\\", and -ino, a diminutive suffix) is an Italian family of tilting trains used in Italy, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the UK, Switzerland and China. Based on the design of the Italian ETR 401 and the British Advanced Passenger Train, it was further developed and manufactured by Fiat Ferroviaria, which was taken over by Alstom in 2000. The idea of a tilting train became popular in the 1960s and 1970s when various rail operators, impressed by the high-speed rail services being introduced in France and Japan, wondered how they could similarly speed up travel without building a dedicated parallel rail network (as those two countries were doing). By tilting, the train could go around curves designed for slower trains at higher speeds without causing undue discomfort to passengers.  Current use  = Italy = ETR 450 was the first production Pendolino train, in service from 1988 to 2015. In Italy, various possibilities were explored (including one early design for fixed carriages with tilting seats). A number of prototypes were built and tested, including an automotrice (self-propelled) derived from ALn 668 diesel car and provided with tilting seats. The first working prototype using a tilting carbody was ETR Y 0160, an electrically powered car launched by FIAT in 1969. This was the first to be christened Pendolino. It led to the construction of a whole EMU in 1975, the ETR 401, built in two units by FIAT. One was put into public service on 2 July 1976 on the Rome-Ancona (later extended to Rimini) line, operated by Italian State Railways. Between Roma and Ancona (km. 295) the train took 2 hours and 50 minutes while the ordinary trains took 3 hours and 30 minutes. The train had four cars and was mostly considered a travelling laboratory for the new technology. The second unit was adapted for service to the broad gauge RENFE Spanish lines. ETR 480 in Roma Termini railway station In 1982, FS retired the ETR 401 from service, due to high maintenance cost, and FIAT transformed it in a train-laboratory, to test the parts for the successor of the ETR 401, ETR 450. After 1988, the trainset went around Europe to demonstrate the greatness of the tilting revolutionary technology and between 1994 and 2001 it was utilised as a charter train. In 2001 the ETR 401 was put aside in Ancona and since 2013, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the first official pendolino service, it has been partly restored. On 29 May 1988, the ETR 450 became the first pendolino to enter in a high-speed regular service in the world. The project of the new train was really similar to the predecessor, but it utilised many electronic parts, as the chopper and the automatic gear. Characterized by a 9-car configuration, the 15 trainsets ETR 450 could run the Rome-Milan line in under four hours, at speeds up to 250 km/h, with a comfort level as the best TEE's cars at the speed of 180‚Äì200 km/h. Passenger numbers increased from 220,000 in 1988 to 2.2 million in 1993. In 1994, the next generation, the ETR 460, styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, began service. Though plagued by technical teething problems, the ETR 460 introduced several innovations, such as more powerful AC asynchronous motors. Further, the pistons actuating the anti-tilting action were placed in the bogie instead of on the carbody sides: this permitted the reorganisation of the vestibules and passenger compartment areas, improving comfort. The bogie-to-body connection is extremely simple and easy to make, with clear advantages for maintenance. ETR 600 ('Frecciargento' of Trenitalia) ETR 460 keeps axle load to an extremely low level (14.5 ton/axle) to allow the train to negotiate curves up to 35% faster than conventional intercity trains (loco plus coaches). The body, which exploits large aluminium extrusion technology, has substantial modularity and allows for extremely low axle weight, whilst fully respecting the highest safety standards, and allows the best exploitation of the space with different loading gauges. ETR 460 was built in only 10 units. Improved versions include 9 ETR 470 for the Italo-Swiss Cisalpino company and 15 ETR 480 / 485 used by Trenitalia under AC lines such as those in France and Switzerland. A total of 34 EMUs of the ETR 460/470/480 - 485 series were built. FIAT Ferroviaria was sold to the French Alstom company in 2000. The development of the Pendolino technology continued in the Italian factories of Alstom and the next generation, the New Pendolino, was delivered to Trenitalia and Cisalpino as the ETR 600 and the ETR 610 from 2006. = Spain = Even before the first Pendolino EMU was built in Italy, in 1972, Fiat and RENFE signed an agreement for cooperation in tilting-train development. The first fruit of the cooperation was the equipment of a RENFE Class 432 EMU with the active tilting suspension in September 1972. After successful tests, Spanish trainmaker Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles and Fiat built a prototype similar to the ETR 401, which was delivered in 1976 as RENFE Class 443, nicknamed Platanito (Little banana) for its yellow livery. The four-car train had a commercial top speed of 180 km/h and achieved a then speed record for Spain of 206 km/h on 6 May 1987. However, the train remained a unique specimen, as RENFE favoured the entirely domestic Talgo Pendular, a tilting train with passive suspension introduced in 1980. After revenue service in 1979-1982, the train was used for charter and test runs. Atocha station approaching Silla Two decades later, to speed up services along its Madrid- Valencia conventional line, Renfe ordered ten Pendolini in 1996. The trains, based on the ETR 460 and ETR 470, were delivered by a joint consortium of Fiat Ferroviaria and GEC-Alsthom from 1998 as RENFE Class 490. The three-car trains are suited for 220 km/h on RENFE's conventional lines electrified with 3 kV DC. The Class 490 took up the new Madrid-Valencia Alaris services in 1999. With growing demand, the capacity of the Class 490 was no longer sufficient, and from February 2008, the trains were transferred to the Mediterr√°neo line between Valencia and Barcelona. For medium-distance services along its high- speed lines, RENFE ordered a non-tilting variant of the Pendolino, based on the ETR 480, in 2001. The 20 four-car trains with a service top speed of 250 km/h were built jointly by Alstom and CAF and delivered as the RENFE Class 104. RENFE deployed them for the new Avant services along the Madrid-Seville high-speed line from 29 December 2004. RENFE ordered another 30 non-tilting medium-distance high-speed trains from Alstom/CAF in a follow-on order, which was later reduced to 13 units. However, these trains are based on the New Pendolino design. The first train of the new class designated RENFE Class 114 was presented in autumn 2008. = Germany = ICE T in curve The West German federal railways DB experimented with tilting technology in the 1970s, but abandoned it. Then in 1987, DB commissioned a study on whether electrification or purchasing diesel tilting trains would be the better option for the Nuremberg-Hof line, and decided for the latter. In 1988, DB ordered 10 tilting DMUs, and another 10 in 1990. All 20 trains of the new DB Class 610 were delivered in 1992. The two-car trains with a top speed of 160 km/h were produced by a consortium of five German companies and Fiat Ferroviaria. Fiat supplied the bogies, the hydraulic tilting suspension, and the other parts of the tilting technology, thus the trains could be called Pendolino (a Fiat trademarked brand name). Deutsche Bahn ordered more regional and express tilting DMUs with other technology (class 611 and class 612: Adtranz/Bombardier, ICE TD/class 605: Siemens). However, for the 230 km/h electric ICE T trains ordered in 1994 for service on conventional lines, Pendolino technology was chosen again. Fiat (Alstom) supplied the bogies and tilting technology for the 32 7-car class 411 and 11 5-car class 415 express trains that entered service from 1999. In 2002, DB placed another order for slightly modified class 411 trains, Alstom Ferroviaria was again supplier of bogies and tilt technology when the 28 trains were delivered from 2004 to 2006. = Switzerland = SBB ETR 610 at the Gotthard Base Tunnel Since the failure of Cisalpino, a joint venture between the Italian Trenitalia and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the Pendolinos used for transalpine transport between Switzerland and Italy, on the Gotthard and L√∂tschberg axis routes, were split between Trenitalia (5 ETR 470 and 7 ETR 610) and SBB (4 ETR 470 and 7 ETR 610). The low reliability of the timetable and of the ETR 470 has led SBB and Trenitalia to always have a reserve train ready at each terminus of the Milan-Z√ºrich route. In 2012 SBB ordered 8 new ETR 610 with delivery in 2015 to be operated on the routes Milan - Geneva and Milan - Z√ºrich.RailwayTechnology: Alstom to supply eight Pendolino trains to Switzerland‚Äôs SBB = Finland = An Sm3 class Pendolino arrives at Jyv√§skyl√§ railway station The Finnish model, the class Sm3, is based on the ETR 460 but was adapted to the specific requirements of VR Group (formerly the Finnish State Railways) and to the cold climatic conditions. The first two units were assembled in 1995 by Rautaruukki-Transtech. A total of sixteen additional units were purchased from Alstom and shipped to Finland between 2000 and 2006. Sm3 trains operate from Helsinki to the cities of Turku, Tampere, Jyv√§skyl√§, Oulu, Kouvola and Vaasa. The trains are composed of six carriages. Four cars are fitted with two asynchronous three-phase AC motors (one for each bogie); two are unpowered but are fitted with pantographs. One of these coaches is a restaurant carriage. The motors deliver a continuous power of and propel the train at a maximum speed of . The Sm3 has received a lot of bad publicity in Finland for its reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and couplers. VR has tried to mitigate the problem by coupling trains only at termini instead of intermediate stations and switching the tilting system off during winter. The trains will go through an extensive maintenance cycle between 2012 and 2014, which will include changes to the couplers and the tilting system in order to make the train more reliable. =Russia= VR Class Sm6 Allegro train in Russia Karelian Trains, a 50-50 joint venture between Finnish VR and Russian Railways, operates four 1522 mm gauge seven-car Pendolinos for use on 220 km/h Saint Petersburg-Helsinki services. Branded Allegro ('). Service started on December 12, 2010, reducing travel time between the cities from five and a half hours to three and a half hours at first and later to three hours. The bogies are specially constructed to allow for 220 km/h speed both at the Finnish gauge and the Russian gauge . = Portugal = Alfa Pendular in Lisbon In Portugal the Pendolino is named Alfa Pendular and is operated by the Portuguese state railway company CP. It connects the cities of Guimar√£es, Braga, Porto, Aveiro, Coimbra, Santar√©m, Lisbon, Albufeira and Faro, among others, and has a top speed of 220 km/h (136.7 mph). The bogies had to be redesigned for operation on Portugal's broad gauge track, and the trains were assembled by Adtranz Portugal at the Amadora plant (former Sorefame). Main contractor was Fiat Ferroviaria later acquired by Alstom with two main subcontractors Adtranz and Siemens that was responsible for the traction and train control. Ten six-car train sets were produced between 1998 and 2001, with commercial operation from early 1999. Based on the ETR 460 the Portuguese Pendolino differs mainly from its predecessor from the carbody width that takes advantage of the Iberian gauge . = Slovenia = Zidani Most. Slovenian Railways ordered three Pendolino tilting trains for its main lines. The 3-car trains, delivered as S≈Ω series 310, were derived from the ETR 460. The series 310 can reach a maximum speed of 200 km/h, but in revenue service on the Slovenian railway network, the maximum it reaches is 160 km/h between Maribor and Pragersko stations, as well as between Grobelno and Celje stations. Since 24 September 2000, the series 310 runs the InterCitySlovenija (ICS) service, linking the major cities of Slovenia in one line: Koper (only in summer), Ljubljana, Zidani Most, Celje and Maribor, with a frequent service that acts as a high-speed shuttle. Until April 2008, once per day the route from Maribor to Ljubljana was extended as international train to Venice via Monfalcone serving Trieste.

Four new 11-car sets were also to be built. The longer units required major infrastructure changes to allow stations and depots to accommodate the 11-car units. With the closure of the Washwood Heath works, the additional vehicles were manufactured at Savigliano.Railway Gazette: More West Coast Pendolinos The first new sets were built with 11 cars and delivered in December 2010.First of four new Alstom Pendolinos enters traffic with Virgin Trains Rail issue 675 27 July 2011 page 18 The lengthening project was completed in December 2012.Pendolino lengthening complete Today's Railways UK issue 133 January 2013 page 66 In the early 1980s, British Rail had planned to bring tilting train technology to the same line with the Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train project. Technical problems caused by pressure to launch the service early and lack of the political will to provide sufficient funding to overcome them forced the abandonment of this early attempt, although much of the technology was used to design and build Pendolino trains. On 23 February 2007, a Virgin Trains Pendolino train derailed in the Grayrigg rail crash, Virgin chairman Richard Branson credited the robust construction of the Pendolino with saving lives in the crash. \\"It is a very sad day - Branson.\\" BBC News. 24 February 2007. Although only some carriages were damaged, the set was written off.Virgin Trains writes off its Lambrigg crash Pensolino Rail issue 585 13 February 2008 page 66 All remaining 56 sets passed to Avanti West Coast with the West Coast Partnership franchise in December 2019.First Trenitalia awarded West Coast Partnership Railway Gazette International 14 August 2019 = Czech Republic = ƒåD class 680 Pendolino departing Ostrava main railway station, on a service to Ko≈°ice, Slovakia. In 1995 consortium consisting of ƒåKD, MSV Stud√©nka, FIAT Ferroviaria and Siemens won tender for the construction of ten tilting trains for the Czech Railways ƒåD, intended for international service Berlin - Prague - Vienna. After ƒåKD bankruptcy in 2000 Alstom (as new owner of FIAT Ferroviaria) took over whole order, reducing number of sets to seven and raising total price, while provided an improved version of ETR 470, equipped to work on , and 3,000 V DC, thus suitable to operate in Germany, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The first set was delivered in 2004 as Pendolino ƒåD 680. While testing between Brno and B≈ôeclav on November 18, 2004, the Pendolino reached a speed of 237 km/h and created a new Czech railway speed record. During the testing period, the train had problems with the Czech signalling system. The problems were said to be solved and the trains entered regular service in December 2005 between Prague and Ostrava. As of late January 2006, all five Czech Pendolino trains in service suffered from software and functional problems, which were later fixed, but the trains still did not receive permission to operate abroad. In December 2006, the trains were given permission to operate in Slovakia and Austria, but as of 2010 permission for Germany has not yet been granted. A Czech Pendolino train appeared in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale and in Timur Bekmambetov's 2008 film Wanted starring Angelina Jolie. = Slovakia = Czech Railways ƒåD has been operating Pendolino as an international train between the Czech Republic and Slovakia for many years. At first it started operating trains from Prague to Bratislava in December 2005 and later also trains from Prague to Ko≈°ice in December 2014. = Poland = A PKP Intercity ED250 in Krak√≥w G≈Ç√≥wny railway station, Poland Polish state railways PKP ordered 14 Pendolinos in 1998, but the order was cancelled in 2000 due to a shortage of funds. In 2010 Alstom won a PKP Intercity tender for high-speed trains with an offer of 20 New Pendolino trains. Similarly to the CRH5, these are non-tilting. Like the ƒåD class 680, the Pendolinos are equipped to operate on 15 kV 16¬∑7 Hz and 25 kV 50 Hz as well as 3 kV DC for operation in Poland, and have the train control systems needed to operate in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.RailwayGazette: Alstom sole bidder in Polish high speed train tender However, certification for international operation is not seen as a priority, as the trains are restricted to domestic services for an initial 10 years under the terms of a grant from the EU Cohesion Fund which covered 22% of the project cost. On 30 May 2011 the Polish state railways PKP signed an agreement with Alstom for 20 Pendolinos ETR 610 for delivery in 2014.Railway Gazette International, 31 May 2011, 'PKP Intercity signs Pendolino Contract,' Gazeta Krakowska The first Pendolino was delivered on August 12, 2013.'The first Pendolino (EIC Premium) is already in Poland,' Alstom Press Release Each seven-car Class ED250 trainset has seats for 57 first class and 345 second class passengers, with a buffet/bar and three four- seat business or family compartments. The Pendolinos were to operate on the high-speed CMK Central Rail Line from Krak√≥w/Katowice to Warsaw, and on the routes from Gdynia to Warsaw and from Wroc≈Çaw to Warsaw.Railway Gazette International, 8 December 2011, Polish high speed rail project cancelled, High speed tests using the new Pendolino ED250 on the CMK Central Rail Line began in November 2013. On the first day of tests, November 16, the Pendolino reached .'Pendolino osiƒÖgne≈Ço na CMK 242 km/h,' Kurier kolejowy 16 11 2013, On 17 November 2013 a new speed record for Polish railways was set at km 184.000 of Polish Line No. 4 when Pendolino ED250 reached a speed of , breaking the 19-year record of . On 24 November 2013 the final day of tests on the CMK Central Rail Line the Pendolino reached .'Bariera 300 km/h nie pad≈Ça. Na koniec test√≥w 293 km/h,' Rynek Kolejowy, 2013 11 24, The contract between the Polish operator PKP Intercity and Alstom called for the first eight Pendolino ED250 trainsets to be delivered on 6 May 2014, tested ('homologated') for operation at using European Train Control System Level 2 signalling. The tests had not been performed by May, and PKP announced that Alstom had failed to meet the contract terms and would be charged penalties as of May 6. Alstom responded that homologation in Poland at 250 km/h using ETCS Level 2 was impossible, since ETCS Level 2 was not operational anywhere in Poland, and the Central Rail Line (Poland) where the first ED250 Pendolino had reached 293 km/h in testing was equipped with ETCS Level 1, not Level 2.Railway Gazette International, 23 Dec 2013, 'First ETCS Certified in Poland,' On 26 June 2014 a compromise was reached between PKP and Alstom under which the Pendolinos would be delivered under a two-stage homologation, first homologated for operation using ETCS Level 1 and eventually to be homologated for ETCS Level 2.'Jest porozumienie PKP w sprawie Pendolino, ruszy przed ≈õwiƒôtami, 'End of Pendolino Dispute,' The Pendolinos were put in service on 14 December 2014.'Polish Pendolino launches 200 km/h operation,' Railway Gazette International, 15 December 2014, 'Wszystko co musisz wiedzeƒá o Pendolino,' Rynek Kolejowy 13 December 2014, In addition to the Central Rail Line from Warsaw to Krak√≥w and Katowice, and from Warsaw to Wroc≈Çaw, the Pendolinos also operate on the 350 km (221 miles) route from Warsaw to Gda≈Ñsk and Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. In 2011-2015 the Warsaw-Gda≈Ñsk-Gdynia route underwent a major upgrading costing $3 billion, partly funded by the European Investment Bank, including track replacement, realignment of curves and relocation of sections of track to allow speeds up to , and modernization of stations. Installation of European Train Control System Level 2 was under way in 2016. When Pendolino services started on 14 December 2014 the previous Warsaw‚ÄìGda≈Ñsk rail travel time of 4-1/2 to 6 hours was reduced to 2 hours 58 minutes by Pendolino, and reduced further to 2 hours 39 minutes in December 2015.'Pendolino z Tr√≥jmiasta do Warszawy,' Introduction of the fast, modern Pendolinos in December 2014 had a major effect on rail ridership in Poland. In the first five months of 2015, Warsaw‚ÄìKrak√≥w rail ridership rose by 50 percent. In May 2015 alone, Warsaw‚ÄìKrak√≥w ridership was 70 percent higher than a year earlier.'Warszawa - Krak√≥w najpopularniejszƒÖ trasƒÖ PKP IC,' Kurier Kolejowy 16.06.2015 In October 2018 Pendolinos operating in Poland still have no access to wireless internet. Thus, as not all of the telecom operators cover 100% of area with 4G support it makes it quite troublesome to do any business critical operations while traveling. Supposedly PKP Intercity has finally signed contract with Pendolinos' producer - Alstom to install necessary equipment in their trains. Estimated deadline for this is the verge of 2018 and 2019. = China = CRH5 in Shenyang, Liaoning, China China Railway High-speed (CRH) purchased technologies from Alstom to assemble 60 sets of high speed EMU trains, which have been named CRH5 and are based on the New Pendolino trains. The CRH5 are non-tilting trains. 30 additional sets were ordered in 2009 and 20 additional sets was ordered in 2010 to complete the current fleet operating on China's northern and eastern lines. = United States = On August 2016, Amtrak and Alstom unveiled the new Avelia Liberty EMU that will take passengers between Washington D.C. and Boston, MA as part of a Northeast Corridor rehabilitation project starting in 2021, replacing the aged Acela Express. The train has safety features that comply with Federal Railroad Administration standards, along with greater comfort, more capacity, built in Wi-Fi, Tiltronix, and with speeds up to .  Cancelled orders  In 1998 Romanian railways CFR announced its intent to order two Pendolinos by the end of the year, and wanted to sign another agreement about the local production of 19 more units under a license agreement the next year. However, these plans were not followed up. In 2002, Slovak railways ZSSK considered purchasing four Pendolinos, in close cooperation with ƒåD of the Czech Republic. The trains were to run as ZSSK class 650. This project was given up in 2004 for lack of funds. The State Administration of Railway transport of Ukraine announced its intent to buy 7 Pendolinos for the UEFA Euro 2012 in 2008, but failed to secure the financing later.

The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation. The first two plies of the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on. The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac- toe has 255,168 leaf nodes. Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using any of numerous tree search algorithms, combined with minimax- like rules to prune the tree. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of \\"pathological\\" game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move. Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves. Solving game trees =Deterministic algorithm version= An arbitrary game tree that has been fully colored With a complete game tree, it is possible to \\"solve\\" the game ‚Äì that is to say, find a sequence of moves that either the first or second player can follow that will guarantee the best possible outcome for that player (usually a win or a tie). The algorithm (which is generally called backward induction or retrograde analysis) can be described recursively as follows. #Color the final ply of the game tree so that all wins for player 1 are colored one way (Blue in the diagram), all wins for player 2 are colored another way (Red in the diagram), and all ties are colored a third way (Grey in the diagram). #Look at the next ply up. If there exists a node colored opposite as the current player, color this node for that player as well. If all immediately lower nodes are colored for the same player, color this node for the same player as well. Otherwise, color this node a tie. #Repeat for each ply, moving upwards, until all nodes are colored. The color of the root node will determine the nature of the game. The diagram shows a game tree for an arbitrary game, colored using the above algorithm. It is usually possible to solve a game (in this technical sense of \\"solve\\") using only a subset of the game tree, since in many games a move need not be analyzed if there is another move that is better for the same player (for example alpha-beta pruning can be used in many deterministic games). Any subtree that can be used to solve the game is known as a decision tree, and the sizes of decision trees of various shapes are used as measures of game complexity. =Randomized algorithms version= Randomized algorithms can be used in solving game trees. There are two main advantages in this type of implementation: speed and practicality. Whereas a deterministic version of solving game trees can be done in , the following randomized algorithm has an expected run time of . Moreover, it is practical because randomized algorithms are capable of \\"foiling an enemy\\", meaning an opponent cannot beat the system of game trees by knowing the algorithm used to solve the game tree because the order of solving is random. The following is an implementation of randomized game tree solution algorithm: def gt_eval_rand(u) -> bool: \\"\\"\\"Returns True if this node evaluates to a win, otherwise False\\"\\"\\" if u.leaf: return u.win else: random_children = (gt_eval_rand(child) for child in random_order(u.children)) if u.op  \\"OR\\": return any(random_children) if u.op  \\"AND\\": return all(random_children) The algorithm makes use of the idea of \\"short- circuiting\\": if the root node is considered an \\"\\" operator, then once one is found, the root is classified as ; conversely, if the root node is considered an \\"\\" operator then once one is found, the root is classified as .

Its peak is above sea level, making it the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Most of the volcano is underwater, and when measured from its underwater base, Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain in the world, measuring in height. Mauna Kea is about a million years old, and has thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes due to construction of cinder cones, decentralization of its rift zones, glaciation on its peak, and weathering by the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now considered dormant. The peak is about higher than Mauna Loa, its more massive neighbor. In Hawaiian religion, the peaks of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only high-ranking ali ªi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living on the slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the volcano's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla‚ÄìMyoporum sandwicense (or mƒÅmane‚Äìnaio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koa‚ÄìMetrosideros polymorpha (or koa‚Äì≈çhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the volcano. With its high elevation, dry environment, and stable airflow, Mauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation. Since the creation of an access road in 1964, thirteen telescopes funded by eleven countries have been constructed at the summit. The Mauna Kea Observatories are used for scientific research across the electromagnetic spectrum and comprise the largest such facility in the world. Their construction on a landscape considered sacred by Native Hawaiians continues to be a topic of debate to this day.

Of these five hotspot volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000 years ago, and is currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits. Mauna Kea is over in volume, so massive that it and its neighbor, Mauna Loa, depress the ocean crust beneath it by . The volcano continues to slip and flatten under its own weight at a rate of less than per year. Much of its mass lies east of its present summit. Mauna Kea stands above sea level, about higher than its neighbor Mauna Loa,\\"Mauna Loa, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, Summary\\" (archive). volcanoes.usgs.gov. United States Geological Survey. November 2, 2017. Retrieved February 12, 2019. and is the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Measured from its base on the ocean floor, it rises over , significantly greater than the elevation of Mount Everest above sea level. Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea has been created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian Ridge‚ÄìEmperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect. Lava flows from Mauna Kea overlapped in complex layers with those of its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once believed to be a part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows. The shield-stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the volcano are tholeiitic basalts, like those of Mauna Loa, created through the mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust. They are covered by the oldest exposed rock strata on Mauna Kea, the post-shield alkali basalts of the HƒÅmƒÅkua Volcanics, which erupted between 250,000 and 70‚Äì65,000 years ago. The most recent volcanic flows are hawaiites and mugearites: they are the post-shield LaupƒÅhoehoe Volcanics, erupted between 65,000 and 4,000 years ago. These changes in lava composition accompanied the slow reduction of the supply of magma to the summit, which led to weaker eruptions that then gave way to isolated episodes associated with volcanic dormancy. The LaupƒÅhoehoe lavas are more viscous and contain more volatiles than the earlier tholeiitic basalts; their thicker flows significantly steepened Mauna Kea's flanks. In addition, explosive eruptions have built cinder cones near the summit. These cones are the most recent eruptive centers of Mauna Kea. Its present summit is dominated by lava domes and cinder cones up to in diameter and hundreds of meters tall. Mauna Kea is the only Hawaiian volcano with distinct evidence of glaciation. Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows. Despite Hawaii's tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the volcano's summit through summer, triggering the formation of an ice cap. There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the P≈çhakuloa (180‚Äì130 ka), WƒÅihu (80‚Äì60 ka) and MƒÅkanaka (40‚Äì13 ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the volcano's upper flanks. Subglacial eruptions built cinder cones during the MƒÅkanaka glaciation, most of which were heavily gouged by glacial action. The most recent cones were built between 9000 and 4500 years ago, atop the glacial deposits, although one study indicates that the last eruption may have been around 3600 years ago. At their maximum extent, the glaciers extended from the summit down to between of elevation. A small body of permafrost, less than across, was found at the summit of Mauna Kea before 1974, and may still be present. Small gullies etch the summit, formed by rain- and snow-fed streams that flow only during winter melt and rain showers. On the windward side of the volcano, stream erosion driven by trade winds has accelerated erosion in a manner similar to that on older Kohala. Mauna Kea is home to Lake Waiau, the highest lake in the Pacific Basin. At an altitude of , it lies within the Puu Waiau cinder cone and is the only alpine lake in Hawaii. The lake is very small and shallow, with a surface area of and a depth of . Radiocarbon dating of samples at the base of the lake indicates that it was clear of ice 12,600 years ago. Hawaiian lava types are typically permeable, preventing lake formation due to infiltration. Either sulfur-bearing steam altered the volcanic ash to low-permeability clays, or explosive interactions between rising magma and groundwater or surface water during phreatic eruptions formed exceptionally fine ash that reduced the permeability of the lake bed. No artesian water was known on the island of Hawaii until 1993 when drilling by the University of Hawaii tapped an artesian aquifer more than below sea level, that extended more than of the borehole's total depth. The borehole had drilled through a compacted layer of soil and lava where the flows of Mauna Loa had encroached upon the exposed Mauna Kea surface and had subsequently been subsided below sea level. Isotopic composition shows the water present to have been derived from rain coming off Mauna Kea at higher than above mean sea level. The aquifer's presence is attributed to a freshwater head within Mauna Kea's basal lens. Scientists believe there may be more water in Mauna Kea's freshwater lens than current models may indicate. Two more boreholes were drilled on Mauna Kea in 2012, with water being found at much higher elevations and shallower depths than expected. Donald Thomas, director of the University of Hawaii's Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes believes one reason to continue study of the aquifers is due to use and occupancy of the higher elevation areas, stating: \\"Nearly all of these activities depend on the availability of potable water that, in most cases, must be trucked to the Saddle from Waimea or Hilo ‚Äî an inefficient and expensive process that consumes a substantial quantity of our scarce liquid fuels.\\" = Future activity = The last eruption of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago (about 2600 BC); because of this inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which is given to the extinct volcano Kohala). Since 8000 BC lava flows have covered 20% of the volcano's summit and virtually none of its flanks. Despite its dormancy, Mauna Kea is expected to erupt again. Based on earlier eruptions, such an event could occur anywhere on the volcano's upper flanks and would likely produce long lava flows, mostly of aƒÅ, long. Long periods of activity could build a cinder cone at the source. Although not likely in the next few centuries, such an eruption would probably result in little loss of life but significant damage to infrastructure.  Human history  = Native history = A stone structure or ahu facing Mauna Kea, on Saddle Road between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful. Settlement expanded inland to the Mauna Loa ‚Äì Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations. The mountain's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source. Early settlement of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival was associated with increased rates of erosion. The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian (or Pacific) rat. The five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains; and Mauna Kea's summit, the highest, is the most sacred. For this reason, a kapu (ancient Hawaiian law) restricted visitor rights to high- ranking ali ªi. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the summit of Mauna Kea was seen as the \\"region of the gods\\", a place where benevolent spirits reside. Poliahu, deity of snow, also resides there. \\"Mauna Kea\\" means \\"white mountain,\\" in reference to its seasonally snow-capped summit. Around AD 1100, natives established adze quarries high up on Mauna Kea to extract the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and mƒÅmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD 1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product. Lake Waiau provided drinking water for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, to give them the strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve. This early era was followed by cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for the immediate needs of the populace. These ahupuaa generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupuaa of Kaohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humuula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the mƒÅmane‚Äìnaio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis), nƒìnƒì (Branta sandvicensis), and palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koa‚Äì≈çhia forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration. = Modern era = View of the mountain from Mauna Loa Observatory There are three accounts of foreigners visiting Hawaii before the arrival of James Cook, in 1778. However, the earliest Western depictions of the isle, including Mauna Kea, were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools. In 1793, cattle were brought by George Vancouver as a tribute to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped confinement and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended Kamehameha I, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for sugarcane plantations and houses. The Saddle Road, named for its crossing of the saddle-shaped plateau between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, was completed in 1943, and eased travel to Mauna Kea considerably. The Pohakuloa Training Area on the plateau is the largest military training ground in Hawaii. The base extends from the volcano's lower flanks to elevation, on state land leased to the US Army since 1956. There are 15 threatened and endangered plants, three endangered birds, and one endangered bat species in the area. Mauna Kea has been the site of extensive archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27 percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76 shrines, 4 adze manufacturing workshops, 3 other markers, 1 positively identified burial site, and 4 possible burial sites. By 2009, the total number of identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing. It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial. = Ascents = David Douglas, a Scottish botanist who died on Mauna Kea in 1834 In pre-contact times, natives traveling up Mauna Kea were probably guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as no evidence of trails has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it. In the early 19th century, the earliest notable recorded ascents of Mauna Kea included the following: * On August 26, 1823, Joseph F. Goodrich, an American missionary, made the first recorded ascent in a single day; however, a small arrangement of stones he observed suggested he was not the first human on the summit. He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit, and also visited Lake Waiau. * On June 17, 1825, an expedition from HMS Blonde, led by botanist James Macrae, reached the summit of Mauna Kea. Macrae was the first person to record the Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense), saying: \\"The last mile was destitute of vegetation except one plant of the Sygenisia tribe, in growth much like a Yucca, with sharp pointed silver coloured leaves and green upright spike of three or four feet producing pendulous branches with brown flowers, truly superb, and almost worth the journey of coming here to see it on purpose.\\" * In January 1834, David Douglas climbed the mountain and described extensively the division of plant species by altitude. On a unrelated traverse, from Kamuela to Hilo in July, he was found dead in a pit intended to catch wild cattle. Although murder was suspected, it was probably an accidental fall. The site, Ka lua kauka , is marked by the Douglas fir trees named for him. * In 1881, Queen Emma traveled to the peak to bathe in the waters of Lake Waiau during competition for the role of ruling chief of the Kingdom of Hawaii. * On August 6, 1889, E.D. Baldwin left Hilo and followed cattle trails to the summit. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the movement of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access to the summit was practically impossible until the construction of a road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted. Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.  Ecology  = Background = Hawaii's geographical isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a large number of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands). The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation. These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation: alpine‚Äìsubalpine, montane, and basal forest. Contact with Americans and Europeans in the early 19th century brought more settlers to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa‚Äì≈çhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native mƒÅmane‚Äìnaio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000. = Alpine environment = Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense sandwicense) growing near the volcano's summit The summit of Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and consists of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and is known as the Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low water retention capacity. Plant species found at this elevation include Styphelia tameiameiae, Taraxacum officinale, Tetramolopium humile, Agrostis sandwicensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Trisetum glomeratum, Poa annua, Sonchus oleraceus, and Coprosma ernodiodes. One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage reduced to a population of just 50 plants, Mauna Kea silversword was thought to be restricted to the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well. The Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve on the southern summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981. The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock, including areas of aeolian desert and Lake Waiau. This ecosystem is a likely haven for the threatened uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and also the center of a study on wƒìkiu bugs (Nysius wekiuicola). Wƒìkiu bugs feed on dead insect carcasses that drift up Mauna Kea on the wind and settle on snow banks. This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus Nysius, which consists of predominantly seed-eating insects. They can survive at extreme elevations of up to because of natural antifreeze in their blood. They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time. Their conservation status is unclear, but the species is no longer a candidate for the Endangered Species List; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980. The closely related Nysius aa lives on Mauna Loa. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and forest tent caterpillar moths have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem; the former survive by hiding under heat-absorbing rocks, and the latter through cold-resistant chemicals in their bodies. = MƒÅmane‚Äìnaio forest = A pair of mƒÅmane (Sophora chrysophylla) trees The forested zone on the volcano, at an elevation of , is dominated by mƒÅmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as mƒÅmane‚Äìnaio forest. MƒÅmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila (Loxioides bailleui). The palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and HualƒÅlai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea‚Äîonly 10% of its former range‚Äîand has been declared critically endangered. The largest threat to the ecosystem is grazing by feral sheep, cattle (Bos primigenius), and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed as far back as the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport. Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was introduced from 1962 to 1964, See: and a plan to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who said that they would damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978). The court ruled in favor of conservationists and upheld the precedence of federal laws before state control of wildlife. Having violated the Endangered Species Act, Hawaii state was required to remove all feral animals from the mountainside. This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981. A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals, at least temporarily. An active control program is in place, though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the mƒÅmane-naio ecosystem.Banko, Paul et al. Surveys reveal decline of the palila. Endangered Species Bulletin, Fall 2008. There are many other species and ecosystems on the island, and on Mauna Kea, that remain threatened by human development and invasive species. The Mauna Kea Forest Reserve protects of mƒÅmane-naio forest under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. Ungulate hunting is allowed year-round. A small part of the mƒÅmane‚Äìnaio forest is encompassed by the Mauna Kea State Recreation Area. = Lower environment = alalƒÅ or Hawaiian crow (Corvus hawaiiensis) is a bird in the crow family. It is extinct in the wild, with plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was formerly Acacia koa ‚Äì Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-≈çhia) forest. Its destruction was driven by an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and those parts of the forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900, logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp. The Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge is a major koa forest reserve on Mauna Kea's windward slope. It was established in 1985, covering of ecosystem remnant. Eight endangered bird species, twelve endangered plants, and the endangered Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) have been observed in the area, in addition to many other rare biota. The reserve has been the site of an extensive replanting campaign since 1989. Parts of the reserve show the effect of agriculture on the native ecosystem, as much of the land in the upper part of the reserve is abandoned farmland. Bird species native to the acacia koa‚Äì≈çhia forest include the Hawaiian crow (Corvus hawaiiensis), the akepa (Loxops coccineus), Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana),  ªakiap≈çlƒÅ ªau (Hemignathus munroi), and Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), all of which are endangered, threatened, or near threatened; the Hawaiian crow in particular is extinct in the wild, but there are plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve.  Summit observatories  Sunset over four telescopes of the Mauna Kea Observatories. From left to right: the Subaru Telescope, the twin Keck I and II telescopes, and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. Mauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing. In the early 1960s, the Hawaii Island Chamber of Commerce encouraged astronomical development of Mauna Kea, as economic stimulus; this coincided with University of Arizona astronomer Gerard Kuiper's search for sites to use newly improved detectors of infrared light. Site testing by Kuiper's assistant Alika Herring in 1964 confirmed the summit's outstanding suitability. An intense three-way competition for NASA funds to construct a large telescope began between Kuiper, Harvard University, and the University of Hawaii (UH), which only had experience in solar astronomy. This culminated in funds being awarded to the \\"upstart\\" UH proposal. UH rebuilt its small astronomy department into a new Institute for Astronomy, and in 1968 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources gave it a 65-year lease for all land within a radius of its telescope, essentially that above . On its completion in 1970, the UH was the seventh largest optical/infrared telescope in the world. Mauna Kea from the summit of HaleakalƒÅ on Maui, approximately away By 1970, two telescopes had been constructed by the US Air Force and Lowell Observatory. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6 m CFHT on Mauna Kea. However, local organisations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980. In January 1982, the UH Board of Regents approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site. In 1998, were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve. The 1982 plan was replaced in 2000 by an extension designed to serve until 2020: it instituted an Office of Mauna Kea Management, designated for astronomy, and shifted the remaining to \\"natural and cultural preservation\\". This plan was further revised to address concern expressed in the Hawaiian community that a lack of respect was being shown toward the cultural values of the mountain. Today the Mauna Kea Science Reserve has 13 observation facilities, each funded by as many as 11 countries. There are nine telescopes working in the visible and infrared spectrum, three in the submillimeter spectrum, and one in the radio spectrum, with mirrors or dishes ranging from . In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope has a mirror, similar in size to the UH88, now the second smallest telescope on the mountain. A \\"Save Mauna Kea\\" movement believes development of the mountain to be sacrilegious. Native Hawaiian non- profit groups such as Kahea, concerned with cultural heritage and the environment, also oppose development for cultural and religious reasons. The multi-telescope \\"outrigger\\" proposed in 2006 was eventually canceled. A planned new telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), has attracted controversy and protests. The TMT was approved in April 2013. In October 2014, the groundbreaking ceremony for the telescope was interrupted by protesters causing the project to temporarily halt. In late March 2015, demonstrators blocked access of the road to the summit again. On April 2, 2015, 300 protestors were gathered near the visitor's center when 12 people were arrested with 11 more arrested at the summit. Among the concerns of the protest groups are the land appraisals and Native Hawaiians consultation. Construction was halted on April 7, 2015 after protests expanded over the state. After several halts, the project has been voluntarily postponed. Governor Ige announced substantial changes to the management of Mauna Kea in the future but stated the project can move forward. The Supreme Court of Hawaii approved the resumption of construction on 31 October 2018.Hawaii top court approves controversial Thirty Meter Telescope BBC News, 2018-10-31. Protestors have posted online petitions as a reaction against the Thirty Meter Telescope. The online petition titled \\"The Immediate Halt to the Construction of the TMT Telescope\\" was posted to Change.org on July 14, 2019. The online petition has currently gathered over 278,057 signatures worldwide. Some protesters have also called for the impeachment of Hawaiian Governor David Ige because of his support for the Thirty Meter Telescope. On July 18, 2019, an online petition titled \\"Impeach Governor David Ige\\" had been posted to Change.org and has currently gathered over 62,562 signatures.  Climate  Mauna Kea has an alpine climate. Due to the influence of its tropical latitude, temperature swings are very low in spite of its high elevation. Frosts are common year round, but the average monthly temperature remains above freezing throughout the year. Snow may fall at an altitude of and above in any month, but occurs most often from October to April. A weather station was operated from 1972 to 1982; however, only 33 months within this period have temperature records; many months have data for only two years. The temperatures presented below are smoothed averages, not the raw numbers recorded by NOAA.  Recreation  Mauna Kea from the Saddle Road near Hilo Mauna Kea's coastline is dominated by the Hamakua Coast, an area of rugged terrain created by frequent slumps and landslides on the volcano's flank. The area includes several recreation parks including Kalopa State Recreation Area, Wailuku River State Park and Akaka Falls State Park. There are over 3,000 registered hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, is a common activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport. Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain. A popular site is Kƒ´puka Puu Huluhulu, a kƒ´puka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill. UKIRT, UH88, Gemini North, and CFHT Mauna Kea's great height and the steepness of its flanks provide a better view and a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa. The height with its risk of altitude sickness, weather concerns, steep road grade, and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult. Until the construction of roads in the mid-20th century, only the hardy visited Mauna Kea's upper slopes; hunters tracked game animals, and hikers traveled up the mountain. These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak accessible to more people. Today, multiple hiking trails exist, including the Mauna Kea Trail, and by 2007 over 100,000 tourists and 32,000 vehicles were going each year to the Visitor Information Station (VIS) adjacent to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy. The Mauna Kea Access Road is paved up to the Center at . One study reported that around a third of visitors and two thirds of professional astronomers working on the mountain have experienced symptoms of acute altitude sickness; visitors traveling up the volcano's flanks are advised to stop for at least half an hour and preferably longer at the visitor center to acclimate to the higher elevation. It is strongly recommended to use a four-wheel drive vehicle to drive all the way to the top. Brakes often overheat on the way down and there is no fuel available on Mauna Kea. A free Star Gazing Program was previously held at the VIS every night from 6-10 pm, with the program canceled due to both a change in operating hours and closure due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Between 5,000 and 6,000 people visit the summit of Mauna Kea each year, and to help ensure safety, and protect the integrity of the mountain, a ranger program was implemented in 2001.

The facilities are located in a 525-acre (212 ha) special land use zone known as the \\"Astronomy Precinct\\", which is located within the 11,228-acre (4,544 ha) Mauna Kea Science Reserve. The Astronomy Precinct was established in 1967 and is located on land protected by the Historical Preservation Act for its significance to Hawaiian culture. The presence and continued construction of telescopes is highly controversial due to Mauna Kea's centraility in native Hawaiian religion and culture, as well as for a variety of environmental reasons. The location is near ideal because of its dark skies from lack of light pollution, good astronomical seeing, low humidity, high elevation of , position above most of the water vapor in the atmosphere, clean air, good weather and low latitude location. Origin and background Significantly predating the current observatories there is evidence of active astronomy on Mauna Kea in the 1901 Land Office Map of the Island of Hawaii showing the \\"Hawaii Astronomy Station\\" near the Mauna Kea summit. After studying photos for NASA's Apollo program that contained greater detail than any ground-based telescope, Gerard Kuiper began seeking an arid site for infrared studies. While he first began looking in Chile, he also made the decision to perform tests in the Hawaiian Islands. Tests on Maui's HaleakalƒÅ were promising, but the mountain was too low in the inversion layer and often covered by clouds. On the \\"Big Island\\" of Hawai ªi, Mauna Kea is considered the highest island mountain in the world. While the summit is often covered with snow, the air is extremely dry. Kuiper began looking into the possibility of an observatory on Mauna Kea. After testing, he discovered the low humidity was perfect for infrared signals. He persuaded Hawai ªi Governor John A. Burns to bulldoze a dirt road to the summit where he built a small telescope on Puu Poliahu, a cinder cone peak. The peak was the second highest on the mountain with the highest peak being holy ground, so Kuiper avoided it. Next, Kuiper tried enlisting NASA to fund a larger facility with a large telescope, housing and other needed structures. NASA, in turn decided to make the project open to competition. Professor of physics, John Jefferies of the University of Hawaii placed a bid on behalf of the university. Jefferies had gained his reputation through observations at Sacramento Peak Observatory. The proposal was for a two-meter telescope to serve both the needs of NASA and the university. While large telescopes are not ordinarily awarded to universities without well- established astronomers, Jefferies and UH were awarded the NASA contract, infuriating Kuiper, who felt that \\"his mountain\\" had been \\"stolen\\" from him. Kuiper would abandon his site (the very first telescope on Mauna Kea) over the competition and begin work in Arizona on a different NASA project. After considerable testing by Jefferies' team, the best locations were determined to be near the summit at the top of the cinder cones. Testing also determined Mauna Kea to be superb for nighttime viewing due to many factors, including the thin air, constant trade winds and being surrounded by sea. Jefferies would build a 2.24 meter telescope with the State of Hawai ªi agreeing to build a reliable, all weather roadway to the summit. Building began in 1967 and first light was seen in 1970. Other groups began requesting subleases on the newly accessible mountaintop. By 1970, two telescopes had been constructed by the United States Air Force and Lowell Observatory. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6 m CFHT on Mauna Kea. However, local organizations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980. In January 1982, the University of Hawai ªi Board of Regents approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site. In 1998, were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve. The 1982 plan was replaced in 2000 by an extension designed to serve until 2020: it instituted an Office of Mauna Kea Management, designated for astronomy, and shifted the remaining to \\"natural and cultural preservation\\". This plan was further revised to address concern expressed in the Hawaiian community that a lack of respect was being shown toward the cultural value the mountain embodied to the region's indigenous people. , the Mauna Kea Science Reserve has 13 observation facilities, each funded by as many as 11 countries. It is one of the world's premier observatories for optical, infrared, and submillimeter astronomy, and in 2009 was the largest measured by light gathering power. There are nine telescopes working in the visible and infrared spectrum, three in the submillimeter spectrum, and one in the radio spectrum, with mirrors or dishes ranging from . In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope has a mirror, similar in size to the UH88, now the second smallest telescope on the mountain. =Controversies= Planned new telescopes, including the Thirty Meter Telescope, have attracted controversy due to their potential cultural and ecological impact. The multi-telescope \\"outrigger\\" extension to the Keck telescopes, which required new sites, was eventually canceled. Three or four of the mountain's 13 existing telescopes must be dismantled over the next decade with the TMT proposal to be the last area on Mauna Kea on which any telescope would ever be built. Management The Reserve was established in 1968, and is leased by the State of Hawai ªi's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). The University of Hawai ªi manages the site and leases land to several multi-national facilities, which have invested more than $2 billion in science and technology. The lease expires in 2033 and after that 40 of 45 square kilometers (25 of 28 square miles) revert to the state of Hawaii. Location Mauna Kea Observatories seen from the base of Mauna Kea The altitude and isolation in the middle of the Pacific Ocean makes Mauna Kea one of the best locations on earth for ground-based astronomy. It is an ideal location for submillimeter, infrared and optical observations. The seeing statistics show that Mauna Kea is the best site in terms of optical and infrared image quality; for example, the CFHT site has a median seeing of 0.43 arcseconds. Accommodations for research astronomers are located at the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy (often called Hale P≈çhaku), by unpaved steep road from the summit at above sea level. An adjacent visitor information station is located at . The summit of Mauna Kea is so high that tourists are advised to stop at the visitor station for at least 30 minutes to acclimate to atmospheric conditions before continuing to the summit, and scientists often stay at Hale P≈çhaku for eight hours or more before spending a full night at observatories on the summit, with some telescopes requiring observers to spend one full night at Hale P≈çhaku before working at the summit.

Opposition and protests In Honolulu, the governor and legislature, enthusiastic about the development, set aside an even larger area for the observatory after the initial project, causing opposition on the Big Island, in the city of Hilo. Native Hawaiians (kƒÅnaka  ª≈çiwi) believed the entire site was sacred and that developing the mountain, even for science, would spoil the area. Environmentalists were concerned about rare native bird populations and other citizens of Hilo were concerned about the sight of the domes from the city. Using town hall meetings, Jefferies was able to overcome opposition by weighing the economic advantage and prestige the island would receive. There has been substantial opposition to the Mauna Kea observatories that continues to grow. Over the years, the opposition to the observatories may have become the most visible example of the conflict science has encountered over access and use of environmental and culturally significant sites. Opposition to development grew shortly after expansion of the observatories commenced. Once access was opened up by the roadway to the summit, skiers began using it for recreation and objected when the road was closed as a precaution against vandalism when the telescopes were being built. Hunters voiced concerns, as did the Hawaiian Audubon Society who were supported by Governor George Ariyoshi. The Audubon Society objected to further development on Mauna Kea over concerns to habitat of the endangered Palila, a species endemic to only specific parts of this mountain. The bird is the last of the finch billed honeycreepers existing on the island. Over 50% of native bird species had been killed off due to loss of habitat from early western settlers or the introduction of non-native species competing for resources. Hunters and sportsmen were concerned that the hunting of feral animals would be affected by the telescope operations. A \\"Save Mauna Kea\\" movement was inspired by the proliferation of telescopes, with opposition believing development of the mountain to be sacrilegious. Native Hawaiian non-profit groups, such as Kahea, whose goals are the protection of cultural heritage and the environment, oppose development on Mauna Kea as a sacred space to the Hawaiian religion. Today, Mauna Kea hosts the world's largest location for telescope observations in infrared and submillimeter astronomy. The land is protected by the United States Historical Preservation Act due to its significance to Hawaiian culture, but still allowed development. 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake A number of the telescopes sustained minor damage during the October 15, 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake and aftershocks. JCMT was performing an inclinometry run and recorded the earthquake on its tilt sensors. Both CFHT and W. M. Keck Observatory were operational and back online by October 19.

The program's services and resources are designed to foster stable family relationships, enhance children's physical and emotional well-being, and establish an environment to develop strong cognitive skills. The transition from preschool to elementary school imposes diverse developmental challenges that include requiring the children to engage successfully with their peers outside the family network, adjust to the space of a classroom, and meet the expectations the school setting provides. Launched in 1965 by its creator and first director Jule Sugarman, Head Start was originally conceived as a catch-up summer school program that would teach low-income children in a few weeks what they needed to know to start elementary school. The Head Start Act of 1981FDA. Memorandum of Understanding. expanded the program. The program was revised and reauthorized in December 2007. , more than 22 million children had participated. The current director of Head Start is Dr. Deborah Bergeron. History First Lady Lady Bird Johnson visits a Head Start class in 1966 Head Start began as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society campaign. Its justification came from the staff of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Stan Salett, civil rights organizer, national education policy adviser, and creator of the Upward Bound Program, is also credited with initiating the Head Start program. Johnson started the War on Poverty shortly after President Kennedy's assassination. The murder shook the nation, and Johnson attempted to gain public trust by passing legacy legislation during the subsequent months. Johnson received an initial briefing from Walter Heller, who informed Johnson of Kennedy's poverty program. By March 1964, the legislation, now known as the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, had been prepared for Congress. The legislation included training, educational, and service programs for communities, including the Job Corps. The Office of Economic Opportunity's Community Action Program launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965. The program was led by Dr. Robert Cooke, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins University, and Dr. Edward Zigler, a professor of psychology and director of the Yale Child Study Center. They designed a comprehensive child development program intended to help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. The following year it was authorized by Congress as a year‚Äìround program. In 1968, Head Start began funding a television series that would eventually be called Sesame Street, operated by the Carnegie Corporation Children's Television Workshop (CTW). In 1969, Head Start was transferred to the Office of Child Development in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (later the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)) by the Nixon Administration. Today the program is in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) division of DHHS. In 1994, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to age three, in an effort to capitalize on research evidence that showed that the first three years are critical to children's long-term development. In the early years, some 700,000 children enrolled at a per- capita cost of $2,000 to $3,000 (2011 dollars). Under the full-time program, enrollment dropped to under 400,000 by the early 1970s. Enrollment reached close to 1 million children by 2011.  Policy Council  The Head Start Policy Council makes up part of the Head Start governing body. Policy Council must be composed of two types of representatives: parents of currently enrolled children and community representatives. At least 51% of the members of this group must be the parents of currently enrolled children (see 45 CFR 1306.3(h) for a definition of a Head Start Parent). All parent members of the Policy Council stand for election or re-election annually through individual parent groups. Grantees/Delegates are required to provide proportionate representation to parents in all program options and settings. If agencies operate programs serving different geographical regions or ethnic groups, they must ensure that all groups being served will have an equal opportunity to serve on the Policy Council. The Policy Council is required to meet once each month. The term follows the federal government fiscal year, running November‚ÄìNovember. Service on the Policy Council board is limited to at most five one year terms. The meetings are conducted in accordance with Robert's Rules. The meeting day and time is agreed upon during the first meeting of the term year and may be adjusted as needed. The Policy Council approval is needed for several program functions, from new hires to the program, as well as for the budget and spending. The Council can serve the program in ways that the others in the program cannot, as it is the only body that is part of Head Start that can do fundraising. In addition to monthly meetings, Policy Council may at times need to hold special or emergency meetings or have a phone vote. Policy Council representatives are required to attend classroom meetings and report back to the Policy Council with issues and needs of the classroom. They may also be asked to sit in on interviews as Head Start requires that a Policy Council representative be present for all interviews. The officers of Policy Council include vice-chairperson, secretary, and vice-secretary. Classrooms are also able to elect alternate Policy Council reps in case the main rep is unable to attend the meetings.  Services and programs  Head Start serves over 1 million children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. Related health services include health screenings, health check- ups and dental check-ups. Family advocates assist parents in accessing community resources. All services are specific to each family's culture and experience. Head Start programs also seek to support children's social emotional development. Programs and services include: * Early Head Start promotes healthy prenatal outcomes, healthy families, as well as infant and toddler development beginning as early as birth. * Head Start helps to create healthy development and early childhood education in low-income children ages three to five. * Family and Community Partnerships engage and support parents to identify and meet their own goals, nurture their children, and advocate for communities that support children and families. * Migrant and Seasonal services are for children of migrant and seasonal farm workers. Service hours are longer and programs extend for fewer months than traditional Head Start. * Head Start serves indigenous Americans with centers on reservations and in urban communities. * Homeless children were included explicitly as subjects with the 2007 re-authorization. Programs must identify and provide services to homeless children of all ages within a reasonable period. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 2001 also requires access to early childhood education such as Head Start for homeless children and families. *Tri-Counties Regional Center is one of twenty-one non-profit regional centers in California providing lifelong services and supports for people with developmental disabilities residing in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. * Early Start is California's response to federal legislation ensuring that services to eligible infants and toddlers are coordinated and family-centered. It is a statewide system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers from birth to 36 months of age. This program is coordinated by regional centers and public school districts. *Each eligible child will be assigned a Service Coordinator who will be responsible for the coordination of early intervention services. Eligible children and their families may receive a variety of early intervention services. Services for young children are family-centered, based on family concerns, priorities and resources, and provided in a child's natural setting. Services may include, but are not limited to: ** Infant stimulation (specialized instruction) in your home or community ** Physical, occupational and/or speech/language therapy ** Behavior services ** Family Resource Centers for parent-to-parent support  Eligibility  Eligibility is largely income-based, although each local program includes other eligibility criteria, such as disabilities and services needed by other family members. Families must earn less than 100% of the federal poverty level. Families may also qualify under a categorical eligibility category‚Äîreceipt of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) funds, Supplemental Security funds, or Homeless, as per the McKinney-Vento Act. Up to 10% of any funded program's enrollment can be from higher income families or families experiencing emergency situations. All programs are required to provide services to children with disabilities, who must comprise 10% of their total enrollment. Per the Head Start Act (2007), programs may elect to serve families whose income is between 100-130% under certain circumstances. Programs must also complete additional reporting requirements if this is appropriate for their community.  Budget and funding  The 2011 federal budget for Head Start was $8.1 billion. 85% was to be devoted to direct services and no more than 15% on administration, serving approximately one million students. Local grantees must provide a 20% cash/in-kind match. Each local grantee is required to obtain an annual financial audit, if it receives more than $500,000 in federal support. Grants are awarded by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Regional Offices and the American Indian ‚Äì Alaska Native and Migrant and Seasonal Program Branches directly to local public agencies, private organizations, Indian tribes and school systems. The individual Head Start classrooms/centers \\"repay\\" the grant through a program known as InKind. The Inkind program is a way to get their parents and their students working together on out of class studies.  Teachers  All lead teachers must have a bachelor's degree or be working towards one. Most have completed six or more courses in early-childhood education. By 2013, all teachers were to have associate degrees in a related field and half must have bachelor's degrees. As of 2003, the average Head Start teacher made $21,000 per year, compared to the public school teacher average of $43,000.NIEER Fact Sheet on Head Start Teachers ‚Äì July 2003 Teachers are also required to complete a (CDA) Child Development Associate certificate.  Operations  Head Start programs typically operate independently from local school districts. Most often they are administered through local social-services agencies. Classes are generally small, with fewer than ten enrollees per adult staff member. Individual programs develop their own academic and social curricula, following federal performance standards.  Effectiveness  Many studies of program effectiveness have been conducted during Head Start's multi-decade history. The studies failed to produce an academic or political consensus about the program's effects. = Supportive studies and statements = A 2020 study found that cohorts that attended Head Start had higher incomes and years of education as adults than similar children who did not attend. In 2015, CCR Analytics, formerly Child Care Analytics, published the results of their Family Outcomes Survey completed by nearly 11,600 California Head Start and Early Head Start parents. 90% of parents surveyed said that Head Start helped them to get or keep a job. 92% of parents surveyed said that Head Start helped them to enroll in an educational or training program. 99% of families surveyed said that Head Start helped them to improve their parenting skills, such as responding to children's misbehavior and helping their children to learn. These results indicate that Head Start has a positive impact on the whole family, beyond the individual children who attend the program. In 2014, CCR Analytics published the results of their study of 49,467 children assessed in the 2012‚Äì2013 school year from 81 Head Start programs throughout the state of California (more than 50% of the entire California Head Start population). Participation in the study was open to all California Head Start programs who used the DRDP-PS 2010 assessment tool. The study found that providing two years of Head Start to a child increases the probability by between 13% to 86% that the child will meet age appropriate expectations. Regression discontinuity design was used to measure program impact without denying a control group the opportunity to attend Head Start. The analysis compared three-year-olds enrolled in Head Start to four-year-olds who returned to Head Start for their second year. This also eliminated the issue of selection bias because both groups chose to attend Head Start as three-year-olds. In 2009, David Deming evaluated the program, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. He compared siblings and found that those who attended Head Start showed stronger academic performance as shown on test scores for years afterward, were less likely to be diagnosed as learning-disabled, less likely to commit crime, more likely to graduate from high school and attend college, and less likely to suffer from poor health as an adult. A randomize study of the pre-k program serving socioeconomically disadvantaged children in Tennessee found short-term gains in language, literacy and math outcomes for pre-k participants compared with children who did not participate, which was also confirmed by a discontinuity analysis (Lip, Farran, Bilbrey, Hofer, & Dong, 2011). Lee collected data across sixty Head Start classrooms in 2007 and 2008. A sample of 1,260 children ages three to four were selected as the final sample. Of these children, 446 had entered Head Start at age 3 and enrolled for a year (Group 1); 498 had been entered at age 4 and enrolled for a year (Group 2); and 316 children had been enrolled for 2 years, entering at age 3 (Group 3). Academic outcome measures in literacy, math and science were collected based on the Head Start and Early Childhood Program Observational Checklist rating on a 4-point scale (1‚Äînot yet to 4‚Äîexcels. Family risk factor indicators (developed by the State Department of Education) included single parent, unemployed parent, teenage parent, parental loss (divorce/death), low parental school achievement, food insufficiency. Group 3 had higher literacy, math and science scores than the other groups. Children in the high-risk group had significantly lower literacy, math, and science scores than those who had three or fewer risk factors. Head Start is associated with significant gains in test scores. Head Start significantly reduces the probability that a child will repeat a grade. In 2002, Garces, Thomas and Currie used data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics to review outcomes for close to 4,000 participating adults followed from childhood and compared with non-participant siblings. Among European Americans, adults who had attended Head Start were significantly more likely to complete high school, attend college and possibly have higher earnings in their early twenties. African-American adults who had attended Head Start were significantly less likely to be booked/charged for a crime. Head Start may increase the likelihood that African-American males graduate from high school. Separately the authors noted larger effects for younger siblings who attended Head Start after an older sibling. In 1998, Congress mandated an intensive study of the effectiveness of Head Start, the \\"Head Start Impact Study,\\" which studied a target population of 5,000 3- and 4-year-old children. The study measured Head Start's effectiveness as compared to other forms of community support and educational intervention, as opposed to comparing Head Start to a nonintervention alternative. Head Start Impact Study First Year Findings were released in June 2005. Study participants were assigned to either Head Start or other parent‚Äìselected community resources for one year. 60% of the children in the control group were placed in other preschools. The first report showed consistent small to moderate advantages to 3-year-old children including pre-reading, pre-vocabulary and parent reports of children's literacy skills. No significant impacts were found for oral comprehension, phonological awareness, or early mathematics skills for either age group. Fewer positive benefits were found for 4-year-olds. The benefits improved with early participation and varied across racial and ethnic groups. These analyses did not assess the benefits' durability. In 1976, Datta summarized 31 studies, concluding that the program showed immediate improvement in IQ scores of participating children, though nonparticipants narrowed the difference over time.Datta, L. (1976). \\"The impact of the Westinghouse/Ohio evaluation on the development of project Head Start: An examination of the immediate and longer-term effects and how they came about,\\" In C. C. Abt (Ed.), The Evaluation of Social Programs (pp. 129‚Äì181) In 1975, Seitz, Abelson, Levine and Zigler compared disadvantaged children enrolled and not enrolled in Head Start, using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The participants were low-income inner-city black children whose unemployed, economically disadvantaged parents were considered unskilled. The Head Start children had attended for at least five months at the time of testing, including nine boys and 11 girls. The non-enrolled group was on the Head Start waiting list. The control group consisted of 11 boys and nine girls. The groups were matched by family income, parental employment and marital status. The tester tested children at home and in a school or office setting. The Head Start children scored higher than the controls in both settings, which suggested preschool intervention programs may have influenced the result. The controls tested at home scored the lowest, apparently due to anxiety from having an unfamiliar person in their homes. The Head Start children were unaffected by the environmental factor. In evaluating this study vs. others, the relatively small sample size should be noted: 20 children vs. thousands in other studies.Seitz, V. Abelson, W., Levine, E. & Zigler, E.\\"Effects of place of testing on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores of disadvantaged Head Start and non-Head Start children\\", Child Development, 1975 = Mixed studies and statements = In 2005, Barnett and Hustedt reviewed the literature and stated, > Our review finds mixed, but generally positive, evidence regarding Head > Start's long-term benefits.

Mothers who had themselves been enrolled in Head Start were compared to adult sisters who were not. Currie and Thomas separately analyzed white, black and Hispanic participants. White children, who were the most disadvantaged, showed larger and longer lasting improvements than black children. = Head Start \\"fade\\" = \\"Head Start Fade\\", in which significant initial impacts quickly fade, has often been observed, as early as second and third grade. One hypothesis is that the decline is because Head Start participants are likely to attend lower-quality schools, which fail to reinforce Head Start gains. = Critical studies and statements =  Head Start Impact study  A 2010 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, Head Start Impact, examined the cognitive development, social-emotional development, and physical health outcomes of 4,667 three- and four-year-old children in a nationally representative sample of programs across 23 states. Children were randomly assigned to either a Head Start group (participants) or a non-Head Start group (control group). The children in the two groups were similar in all measured characteristics at program entry. Pre-participation assessments of all critical outcome measures were taken. Control group children optionally enrolled in non-Head Start programs. Nearly half of the control-group children enrolled in other preschool programs. Outcome measures covered cognitive development, social-emotional development, health status and access to health care, and parenting practices. Head Start students were split into two cohorts ‚Äì 3-year-olds with two years of Head Start and 4-year-olds with one year of Head Start. The study found: * Participants showed positive effects in cognitive skills during their Head Start years, including letter-naming, vocabulary, letter-word identification and applied math problems, although the \\"advantages children gained during their Head Start and age 4 years yielded only a few statistically significant differences in outcomes at the end of 1st grade for the sample as a whole. Impacts at the end of kindergarten were scattered. ... \\" The gains applied to different skills across cohorts and grades, undermining generalizations about program impacts. * Participants showed fewer significant improvements in social and behavioral skills, even in the Head Start year, with inconsistent results between the three- and four- year-old cohorts. The four-year-old cohort showed no significant improvement in the Head Start year or kindergarten, but in third grade, parents reported a significant reduction in total problem behavior and social and behavioral skills. Three-year-olds showed multiple, significant improvements in social and behavioral skills, but only for outcomes assessed by parents. Significant negative effects emerged in teacher relationships as rated by first-grade and third-grade teachers; and no significant positive effects for this cohort were reported by teachers for any elementary year. * By the end of first grade, only \\"a single cognitive impact was found for each cohort\\". Compared to students in the control group, the 4-year-old Head Start cohort did \\"significantly better\\" on vocabulary and the 3-year-old cohort tested better in oral comprehension. * Head Start had significant health-related effects, especially in increasing the number of children receiving dental care and having health-insurance coverage. These effects were not consistent, however. For example, while participants increased health-insurance coverage, it did not extend into the third-grade year for either cohort. Parenting practice changes were significant, but applied only to the three-year-old cohort. Most related to discipline, such as reduced spanking or time-outs. The spanking outcome occurred did not last into the first grade. The significant effect on parental reading to children did not last into kindergarten. A secondary analysis by Peter Bernardy used HSIS data to explore the transient aspect of the initial effects. He considered whether learning skills not examined in the HSIS might be more durable than cognitive skills. These included attention, persistence, and confidence as evaluated by teachers, parents and independent assessors. Improvements in these skills could portend better longer-term outcomes. Bernardy also examined whether Head Start curriculum or elementary school quality affected outcomes and whether control group attendance at other preschools compromised the results. Only one effect was statistically significant out of the 43 possible comparisons, and none was in the elementary grades. Since statistical significance is generally measured at the 95th percentile, the false positive rate is 5 percent, meaning that approximately 2 \\"significant\\" effects would be expected to emerge from the 43 comparisons even if the data were random. The significant effect reported was the parent rating of attention at the end of the Head Start year for three-year-old children. This finding was not buttressed by ratings by independent assessors and teachers. The HSIS study concludes, \\"Head Start has benefits for both 3-year- olds and 4-year-olds in the cognitive, health, and parenting domains, and for 3-year-olds in the social-emotional domain. However, the benefits of access to Head Start at age four are largely absent by 1st grade for the program population as a whole. For 3-year-olds, there are few sustained benefits, although access to the program may lead to improved parent-child relationships through 1st grade, a potentially important finding for children's longer-term development.\\"  Other comments  According to the Administrative History of the Office of Economic Opportunity, children who finish the program and are placed into disadvantaged schools perform worse than their peers by second grade. Only by isolating such children (such as dispersing and sending them to better-performing school districts) could gains be sustained.Administrative History of the Office of Economic Opportunity, Vol. I, p. 252, Box 1 In an op- ed piece in The New York Times, \\"Head Start Falls Further Behind\\", Besharov and Call discuss a 1998 evaluation that led to a national reevaluation of the program. The authors stated that research concluded that the current program had little meaningful impact. However, they did not cite primary sources. In 2011, Time magazine's columnist Joe Klein called for the elimination of Head Start, citing an internal report that the program is costly and makes a negligible impact on children's well-being over time. Klein wrote: > You take the million or so poorest 3- and 4-year-old children and give them > a leg up on socialization and education by providing preschool for them; if > it works, it saves money in the long run by producing fewer criminals and > welfare recipients ... it is now 45 years later.

And > finally there is indisputable evidence about the program's effectiveness, > provided by the Department of Health and Human Services: Head Start simply > does not work. W. Steven Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, rebutted Klein, \\"Weighing all of the evidence and not just that cited by partisans on one side or the other, the most accurate conclusion is that Head Start produces modest benefits including some long-term gains for children.\\"Valerie Strauss, \\"Does Head Start work for kids? The bottom line\\", The Washington Post, March 5, 2013. Fryer and Levitt found no evidence that Head Start participation had lasting effect on test scores in the early years of school.

Buckram is a stiff cotton (occasionally linen or horse hair) cloth with a loose weave, often muslin. The fabric is soaked in a sizing agent such as wheat starch paste, glue (such as PVA glue), or pyroxylin (gelatinized nitrocellulose, developed around 1910), then dried. When rewetted or warmed, it can be shaped to create durable firm fabric for book covers, hats, and elements of clothing. In the Middle Ages, \\"bokeram\\", as it was known then, was fine cotton cloth, not stiff. The etymology of the term is uncertain; the commonly mentioned derivation from Bokhara is, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, uncertain. Use in bookbinding In bookbinding, buckram has several attractive qualities. In addition to being highly durable, buckram does not allow the bookbinder's paste to seep through and cause discoloration or stains on the book's front and back covers. In bookbinding, pyroxylin-impregnated fabrics are considered superior to starch- filled fabrics because their surfaces are more water resistant, they are more resistant to insects and fungi, and they are generally stronger. They wear well and are particularly suitable for use in library binding where many people will be repeatedly handling the same books. Pyroxylin also allows for unique decorative effects on book covers. They, too, are water repellant and immune to insect attack and fungi, but they do not wear as well as starch impregnated cloths because of cracking at the joints and occasional peeling of the coating. Use in millinery Millinery buckram is different from bookbinding buckram. The former is impregnated with a starch which allows it to be softened in water, pulled over a hat block, and left to dry into a hard shape. Millinery buckram comes in many weights, including lightweight or baby buckram (often used for children's and dolls' hats), single-ply buckram, and double buckram (also known as theatrical buckram or crown buckram).

Blue above world GDP (PPP) per capita Orange below world GDP (PPP) per capita The North‚ÄìSouth divide (or Global North and Global South) is a socio-economic and political division of Earth popularized in the late 20th century and early 21st century. Generally, definitions of the Global North is not exclusively a geographical term, and it includes Australia, Canada, most Western European countries, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan (ROC) and the United States. The Global South is made up of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Pacific Islands, and the developing countries in Asia, including the Middle East. It is home to: Brazil, India and China, which, along with Indonesia and Mexico, are the largest Southern states in terms of land area and population. The North is mostly correlated with the Western world (previously called \\"First World\\"), plus much of the \\"Second World\\", while the South largely corresponds with the developing countries (previously called \\"Third World\\") and Eastern world. The two groups are often defined in terms of their differing levels of wealth, economic development, income inequality, democracy, and political and economic freedom, as defined by freedom indices. Nations in the North tend to be wealthier, less unequal and considered more democratic and to be developed countries who export technologically advanced manufactured products; Southern states are generally poorer developing countries with younger, more fragile democracies heavily dependent on primary sector exports and frequently share a history of past colonialism by Northern states. Nevertheless, the divide between the North and the South is often challenged and said to be increasingly incompatible with reality. In economic terms, as of the early 21st century, the North‚Äîwith one quarter of the world population‚Äîcontrols four-fifths of the income earned anywhere in the world. 90% of the manufacturing industries are owned by and located in the North. Inversely, the South‚Äîwith three quarters of the world population‚Äîhas access to one-fifth of the world income. As nations become economically developed, they may become part of definitions the \\"North\\", regardless of geographical location; similarly, any nations that do not qualify for \\"developed\\" status are in effect deemed to be part of the \\"South\\". History The idea of categorizing countries by their economic and developmental status began during the Cold War with the classifications of East and West. The Soviet Union and China represented the East, and the United States and their allies represented the West. The term 'Third World' came into parlance in the second half of the twentieth century. It originated in a 1952 article by Alfred Sauvy entitled \\"Trois Mondes, Une Plan√®te.\\" Early definitions of the Third World emphasized its exclusion from the East-West conflict of the Cold War as well as the ex- colonial status and poverty of the nations it comprised. Efforts to mobilize the Third World as an autonomous political entity were undertaken. The 1955 Bandung Conference was an early meeting of Third World states in which an alternative to alignment with either the Eastern or Western Blocs was promoted. Following this, the first Non-Aligned Summit was organized in 1961. Contemporaneously, a mode of economic criticism which separated the world economy into \\"core\\" and \\"periphery\\" was developed and given expression in a project for political reform which \\"moved the terms 'North' and 'South' into the international political lexicon.\\" In 1973, the pursuit of a New International Economic Order which was to be negotiated between the North and South was initiated at the Non-Aligned Summit held in Algiers. Also in 1973, the oil embargo initiated by Arab OPEC countries as a result of the Yom Kippur War caused an increase in world oil prices, with prices continuing to rise throughout the decade. This contributed to a worldwide recession which resulted in industrialized nations increasing economically protectionist policies and contributing less aid to the less developed countries of the South. The slack was taken up by Western banks, which provided substantial loans to Third World countries. However, many of these countries were not able to pay back their debt, which led the IMF to EXtended further loans to them on the condition that they undertake certain liberalizing reforms. This policy, which came to be known as structural adjustment, and was institutionalized by International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and Western governments, represented a break from the Keynesian approach to foreign aid which had been the norm from the end of the Second World War. After 1987, reports on the negative social impacts that structural adjustment policies had had on affected developing nations led IFIs to supplement structural adjustment policies with targeted anti-poverty projects. Following the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Second World countries joined the First World, and others joined the Third World. A new and simpler classification was needed. Use of the terms \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" became more widespread. Defining development Being categorized as part of the \\"North\\" implies development as opposed to belonging to the \\"South\\", which implies a lack thereof. According to N. Oluwafemi Mimiko, the South lacks the right technology, it is politically unstable, its economies are divided, and its foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports to the North, along with the fluctuation of prices. The low level of control it exercises over imports and exports condemns the South to conform to the 'imperialist' system. The South's lack of development and the high level of development of the North deepen the inequality between them and leave the South a source of raw material for the developed countries.Mimiko, N. Oluwafemi. Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business. North Carolina: Carolina Academic Press, 2012. 22 & 47\\\\. Print. The north becomes synonymous with economic development and industrialization while the South represents the previously colonized countries which are in need of help in the form of international aid agendas. In order to understand how this divide occurs, a definition of \\"development\\" itself is needed. Northern countries are using most of the earth resources and most of them are high entropic fossil fuels. Reducing emission rates of toxic substances is central to debate on sustainable development but this can negatively affect economic growth. The Dictionary of Human Geography defines development as \\"[p]rocesses of social change or [a change] to class and state projects to transform national economies\\".Gregory, Derek, Ron Johnston, Geraldine Pratt, Michael J. Watts, and Sarah Whatmore. The Dictionary of Human Geography. 5th. Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. Print. This definition entails an understanding of economic development which is imperative when trying to understand the north‚Äìsouth divide. Economic Development is a measure of progress in a specific economy. It refers to advancements in technology, a transition from an economy based largely on agriculture to one based on industry and an improvement in living standards. Economic development ‚Äúimplies progressive changes in the socio-economic structure of a country [‚Ä¶] [a] change in technological and institutional organization of production as well as in distributive pattern of income‚Äù Other factors that are included in the conceptualization of what a developed country is include life expectancy and the levels of education, poverty and employment in that country. Furthermore, in Regionalism Across the North-South Divide: State Strategies and Globalization, Jean Grugel states that the three factors that direct the economic development of states within the Global south is \\"√©lite behaviour within and between nation states, integration and cooperation within 'geographic' areas, and the resulting position of states and regions within the global world market and related political economic hierarchy.\\" Brandt Line The Brandt line, a definition from the 1980s dividing the world into the wealthy north and the poor south. Countries' average latitude and GDP per capita according to The World Factbook (2013). The Brandt Line is shown in bold. The Brandt Line is a visual depiction of the north‚Äìsouth divide, proposed by West German former Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1980s. It encircles the world at a latitude of approximately 30¬∞ North, passing between North and Central America, north of Africa and the Middle East, climbing north over China and Mongolia, but dipping south so as to include Australia, Japan, New Zealand and a mark for the city-state of Singapore in the \\"Rich North\\". Digital and technological divide Map showing internet usage by country The global digital divide is often characterised as corresponding to the north‚Äìsouth divide; however, Internet use, and especially broadband access, is now soaring in Asia compared with other continents. This phenomenon is partially explained by the ability of many countries in Asia to leapfrog older Internet technology and infrastructure, coupled with booming economies which allow vastly more people to get online. Theories explaining the divide The development disparity between the North and the South has sometimes been explained in historical terms. Dependency theory looks back on the patterns of colonial relations which persisted between the North and South and emphasizes how colonized territories tended to be impoverished by those relations. Theorists of this school maintain that the economies of ex-colonial states remain oriented towards serving external rather than internal demand, and that development regimes undertaken in this context have tended to reproduce in underdeveloped countries the pronounced class hierarchies found in industrialized countries while maintaining higher levels of poverty. Dependency theory is closely intertwined with Latin American Structuralism, the only school of development economics emerging from the Global South to be affiliated with a national research institute and to receive support from national banks and finance ministries. The Structuralists defined dependency as the inability of a nation's economy to complete the cycle of capital accumulation without reliance on an outside economy. More specifically, peripheral nations were perceived as primary resource exporters reliant on core economies for manufactured goods. This led the Structuralists to advocate for import-substitution industrialization policies which aimed to replace manufactured imports with domestically made products. Uneven immigration patterns lead to inequality: in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries immigration was very common into areas previously less populated (North America, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Australia, New Zealand) from already technologically advanced areas (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Portugal). This facilitated an uneven diffusion of technological practices since only areas with high immigration levels benefited. Immigration patterns in the twenty-first century continue to feed this uneven distribution of technological innovation. People are eager to leave countries in the South to improve the quality of their lives by sharing in the perceived prosperity of the North. \\"South and Central Americans want to live and work in North America. Africans and Southwest Asians want to live and work in Europe. Southeast Asians want to live and work in North America and Europe\\". New Economic Geography explains development disparities in terms of the physical organization of industry, arguing that firms tend to cluster in order benefit from economies of scale and increase productivity which leads ultimately to an increase in wages. The North has more firm clustering than the South, making its industries more competitive. It is argued that only when wages in the North reach a certain height, will it become more profitable for firms to operate in the South, allowing clustering to begin.  Challenges  total wealth (trillions USD), Credit Suisse The accuracy of the North‚ÄìSouth divide has been challenged on a number of grounds. Firstly, differences in the political, economic and demographic make-up of countries tend to complicate the idea of a monolithic South. Globalization has also challenged the notion of two distinct economic spheres. Following the liberalization of post-Mao China initiated in 1978, growing regional cooperation between the national economies of Asia has led to the growing decentralization of the North as the main economic power. The economic status of the South has also been fractured. As of 2015, all but roughly the bottom 60 nations of the Global South were thought to be gaining on the North in terms of income, diversification, and participation in the world market. Globalization has largely displaced the North‚ÄìSouth divide as the theoretical underpinning of the development efforts of international institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, WTO, and various United Nations affiliated agencies, though these groups differ in their perceptions of the relationship between globalization and inequality. Yet some remain critical of the accuracy of globalization as a model of the world economy, emphasizing the enduring centrality of nation-states in world politics and the prominence of regional trade relations.  Future development  Some economists have argued that international free trade and unhindered capital flows across countries could lead to a contraction in the North‚ÄìSouth divide. In this case more equal trade and flow of capital would allow the possibility for developing countries to further develop economically. As some countries in the South experience rapid development, there is evidence that those states are developing high levels of South‚ÄìSouth aid.Cabral and Weinstock 2010. Brazil: an emerging aid player . London: Overseas Development Institute Brazil, in particular, has been noted for its high levels of aid ($1 billion annually‚Äîahead of many traditional donors) and the ability to use its own experiences to provide high levels of expertise and knowledge transfer. This has been described as a \\"global model in waiting\\".Cabral, Lidia 2010. Brazil‚Äôs development cooperation with the South: a global model in waiting . London: Overseas Development Institute The United Nations has also established its role in diminishing the divide between North and South through the Millennium Development Goals, all of which were to be achieved by 2015. These goals seek to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve global universal education and healthcare, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development.

Etymology Palmer thought the name Amka to come from the Arabic form of ‚Äúdeep‚Äù,Palmer, 1881, p. 40 while Ringgren suggested that the name preserves the name of Beth Ha-Emek, a city mentioned in as part of the allotment of the Tribe of Asher.Ringgren, 2000, p. 204. History =Ancient period= During the Roman period, the village located at the same site was called Kefar Amqa. In the Byzantine period the location was probably identified with the village of \\"Amico\\". =Middle Ages= During the Crusader period, Amka was referred to as Amca. In 1179 Joscelin III acquired the land of the village,Strehlke, 1869, pp. 10-11, No. 11; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RHH, p. 154, No. 579, cited in Frankel, 1988, pp. 257, 263 and in 1220 Jocelyn III's daughter Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg, sold their land, including ‚Äò‚ÄôAmca‚Äô‚Äô, to the Teutonic Knights.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 43- 44, No. 53; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RHH, p. 248, No. 934 (16); cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 263 In 1283, Amka was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders during the hudna between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur (Qalawun).Barag, 1979, p. 204 =Ottoman Empire= Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Amqa appeared in the 1596 tax registers as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Akka under the liwa' (district) of Safad, with a population of 215. All the inhabitants were Muslim.39 households, according to H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 192 The villagers paid taxes on a number of crops, such as wheat, barley, olives, cotton and fruit, and on other types of produce, such as goats and beehives.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 192. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 4Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In the early 18th century the village was under control of Shaykh Najm. He had an agreement to sell the cotton from this and other villages under his control exclusively to the Dutch trader Paul Maashook. In return, Maashook would pay the miri (tax slated for funding the annual Hajj caravan), which was normally payable by the village shaykhs (chiefs).Cohen, 1973, p.12. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 93 The Syrian Sufi teacher and traveler Mustafa al-Bakri al-Siddiqi (1688‚Äì1748/9), who traveled through the region in the first half of the 18th century, said that he prayed in the village after visiting the citadel of Atlit.Khalidi, 1992, p.4 In 1776 the village was used as a base by Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar to suppress a revolt led by Ali al-Zahir, one of the sons of Sheikh Zahir al- Umar, who ruled the Galilee between 1730 and 1775.Petersen, 2001, p. 93.

In the late 19th century, the village was described as being built of stone, situated on a slight rise in a valley, surrounded by olive and fig trees, and arable land. There were an estimated 300 Druze living there.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 145 Later, the residents were described as Muslims who maintained a village mosque. In 1887, the Ottoman authorities built a school in ¬¥Amqa.

It was largely destroyed, with the exception of its school and its mosque, and most of its inhabitants were expelled, with the exception of its former Druze inhabitants, who still live nearby. Some of the inhabitants remained in Israel as present absentees.; On 1 March 1949 a UN observer reported villagers from 'Amqa amongst a large group of people expelled by the IDF which arrived at Salim in the West Bank. He also noted other villagers from 'Amqa in a group expelled on 26 March.Morris, 1993, pp. 146-147 In February 1950, the village was declared a closed area. The Arab population remained under Martial Law until 1966. A group of Yemenite Jewish immigrants were settled in Amka in 1949. Depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war,Khalidi, 1992, p. 5 all that remains of the Arab village structures are an elementary school for boys, founded under Ottoman rule in 1887 and one mosque.

Its population in 1945 was 770. The Crusaders referred to it as \\"Myary\\". By the 19th century, during Ottoman rule, it was a large Muslim village. The village was a center of Palestinian Arab rebel operations during the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine against British rule and consequently the village was completely dynamited by the British. Mi'ar was later restored, but it was depopulated by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Jewish communities of Atzmon, Ya'ad and Manof are located on former village land. History =Middle Eges= Mi'ar contained the archaeological remains of buildings, fragments of columns, olive presses, and cisterns. It was referred to by the Crusaders as \\"Myary\\". =Ottoman era= Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, Mi'ar appeared in the 1596 tax registers as being in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). It had a population 10 Muslim households, an estimated 55 persons. The villagers paid fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat and barley, fruit, goats and beehives; a total of 1,235 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah 1977, p. 193, as given in Khalidi, 1992, p. 26Note that Rhode 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. In the late 1700, the Italian traveler Giovanni Mariti noted that around al-Damun and Mi'ar were two \\"delightful valleys, ornamented with groves and wild shrubs. The peasants who live in the hamlets around, enjoy a most pleasant situation.\\"Mariti, 1792, p. 343 In 1875, French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited Mi'ar, and noted that it contained \\"several trunks of columns, three broken capitals, and a certain number old cut stones, coming from some ancient building. I observed also many blocks of ancient appearance disposed round threshing-floors. There are also cisterns, walls, and caves cut in the rock, which belong to times more or less remote.\\"Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 434, as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 325 He found Mi'ar to be inhabited by 500 Muslims.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 434, as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 271 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as a large village situated on high ground that was rough and uncultivated. The villagers, whose number was estimated to be 1,500 (in 1859), cultivated some 30 faddans.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 271. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 26. A population list from about 1887 showed that Mi'ar had about 480 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 176 An elementary school was founded by the Ottomans in 1888, however, it closed its doors in the final years of the Empire. =British Mandate era= Mi'ar being blown up by the British in 1938. British forces drove out the Ottomans in 1917, during World War I, and the British Mandate of Palestine was established in 1920. In the 1922 British census, Mi'ar had a population of 429 Muslims.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Acre, p. 37 The population increased to 543, still all Muslim, in the 1931 census and the inhabitants lived in a total of 109 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 102. A number of Mi'ar's residents participated in 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine, and the village became a center of rebel operations in the Galilee.Bethell, 1979, p. 49 The rebels often opened fired on British troops passing near Mi'ar, damaged roads in the vicinity to render them impassable by the British authorities, cut electrical cables, and planted landmines to hit British vehicles. One of the authorities' controversial methods of suppressing the revolt was the blowing up of houses in a village where there was support for rebels. On 26 October 1938, two British battalions launched a raid against Mi'ar and began dynamiting the large houses of the village. They then demanded Mi'ar's mukhtar (headman) to issue a call to the village's rebels to surrender their rifles or else the dynamiting would continue. No rifles were surrendered and the British resumed their dynamiting of the village's homes. Mi'ar was entirely destroyed for its alleged support of the rebels.Mills, J. \\"British Minesweepers and Dynamite Battle Palestine's Arab Rebels\\", The Milwaukee Sentinel, Haifa, 26 October 1938. A New York Times reporter present during the destruction wrote, \\"When the [British] troops left, there was little else remaining of this once busy village except a pile of mangled masonry.\\" The village was rebuilt and in the 1945 statistics, the population of Mi'ar grew to 770, all Muslims. A total of 2,878 dunams of village land was used for cereals, while 113 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 81 =1948 War and aftermath= On 20 June 1948 Israeli troops entered Mi'ar and shot indiscriminately against its residents while they were working in their fields. According to Israeli scholar, Ilan Papp√©, the village's houses were destroyed and forty inhabitants were killed. One witness to the Israeli attack was the Palestinian writer, Muhammad Ali Taha, then a 17-year-old boy.Papp√© 2007, p. 150. Mi'ar's residents later returned and continued living in the village until Israeli troops from the Sheva Brigade reoccupied it on 15 July 1948, as part of the second stage of Operation Dekel.Morris 2004, p. 421 According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, Mi'ar's 893 inhabitants fled during the Israeli assault, while Papp√© asserts that they were expelled. The Jewish communities of Segev (now Atzmon), Ya'ad and Manof were built on Mi'ar's lands, while Yuvalim, located east of the village site, is located on land traditionally belonging to Sakhnin. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the village's remains in 1992 consisted of \\"some truncated stone walls, simple graves, and fig and olive trees\\" and that the site, which \\"was largely covered by cypress trees\\" had become a recreational area. Many of the refugees of Mi'ar became internally displaced Palestinians resettled in nearby Kabul, Sha'ab and Arraba.Boqa'i 2005, p. 80. Neighborhoods in each of the villages where Mi'ar refugees and their descendants reside are named Mi'ari after their village of origin.

Al-Mansura (), was a Palestinian village that was depopulated by the Israeli army during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. In 1945, it had a population of 2,300 together with the neighboring villages of Dayr al-Qassi (also depopulated) and Fassuta. The population was predominantly Christian and most its residents live in what is now the state of Israel. It was situated on the northern end of a mountain in the Upper Galilee whose summit was behind the village to the south. It was connected to the coastal Acre-Ras al-Naqoura highway via a secondary road. History The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517; in 1596 it appeared under the name of al-Mansura in the tax registers as part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira in the Sanjak (district) of Safad. It had an all Muslim population, consisting of 17 households and 5 bachelors. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues and an olive oil press; the taxes totalled 3,656 ak√ße. All of the taxes went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 178 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described the place as having \\"A few heaps of stones and some foundations. The masonry is medium-size, and well-dressed. The door- posts are of stone; there are cisterns on top of the hill, which is steep.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 242 =British Mandate era= Until 1923, after borders were renegotiated between the British and French governments (who controlled the northern and southern parts of the Levant, respectively, at the time), al-Mansura was a part of Lebanon. Afterward it became part of the Mandatory Palestine and was described as a hamlet by the Palestine Index Gazetteer. In the 1931 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate government, it was counted under the much larger Christian village of Fassuta. The total population of the two places were 688 inhabitants; 81 Muslims and 607 Christians, in a total of 129 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 100 The houses of al-Mansura were spaciously separated from each other and the village had a church dedicated to Mari Yohanna (John the Baptist). The chief source of income was from agriculture and husbandry and the main sources of drinking water came from a well to the north and three water tanks. In the 1945 statistics, its land was grouped with the lands of Fassuta (existent) and Dayr al-Qassi; the total population was 2,300 and their total land area was 34,011 dunums.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 130 =Israeli period= Al-Mansura was believed to have been attacked during the Israeli offensive Operation Hiram in October 1948. In mid-November, the Israeli Army had Palestinian Arab villages on the Lebanese border cleared, including al- Mansura. Its residents were expelled from the village, with some leaving for Lebanon while most were sent to the Arab town of Rameh in the heart of the Galilee. The Maronite Church requested that the Israeli government allow al- Mansura's inhabitants to resettle the village but were refused. The residents of al-Mansura continued to demand permission from the Israeli courts to resettle for some time after, but were unsuccessful. Several Jewish localities have been built on al-Mansura's lands, including Elkosh established in 1949, the military base Biranit in the early 1950s, Netu'a in 1966, Mattat in 1979 and Abirim in 1980. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi whose researchers visited the village before 1992, \\"The village houses have been completely leveled. Much of the resulting debris has been pushed together in heaps along the northern edge of the site.\\" The only structure remaining was the partially collapsed church.

The latter is a subject of controversy as to whether it is a crocodile or actually belongs in the family Gavialidae. Further genetic analysis has to be done to come to a final conclusion. Taxonomy A total of three extant genera are placed in the family Crocodylidae, including a total of 15 species, including the desert crocodile, which is now accepted as a true species rather than a subspecies of the Nile crocodile. Recent studies suggest the dwarf crocodile, Osteolaemus tetraspis, is not a single, but two or even three species, and that the slender-snouted crocodile is two species. If so, the species count of extant crocodiles would be 18 or 19, putting the extant crocodylian species to a total of 28 or 29 instead of 25. =True crocodiles= The two extant genera of true crocodiles, Crocodylus and Osteolaemus, are in the subfamily Crocodylinae. Even according to traditional classification, the Tomistoma is not a true crocodile, though it is a member of the family Crocodylidae. Latest molecular evidence points to an even greater difference, creating the possibility that in fact Tomistoma is genetically closer to the gharial than true crocodiles. If proven, the species will be classified under the family Gavialidae. Their most obvious external differences from alligators are visible in the head. Crocodiles have narrower and longer heads, and more V-shaped than U-shaped snouts. The alligator's upper jaw is wider than its lower jaw, and the teeth in the lower jaw fit into small depressions in the upper jaw. The upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed. When the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to- distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define a species. =Crocodylidae= American crocodile at La Manzanilla, Jalisco, Mexico A skull of the extinct Voay robustus Most species are grouped into the genus Crocodylus.

The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific totanus is from T√≥tano, the Italian name for this bird. Winter plumage, at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (Singapore)  Description and systematics  Bird (non-breeding) in flight (Laguna di Venezia, Italy) Redshank searching for food. Common redshanks in breeding plumage are a marbled brown color, slightly lighter below. In winter plumage they become somewhat lighter-toned and less patterned, being rather plain greyish-brown above and whitish below. They have red legs and a black-tipped red bill, and show white up the back and on the wings in flight. The spotted redshank (T. erythropus), which breeds in the Arctic, has a longer bill and legs; it is almost entirely black in breeding plumage and very pale in winter. It is not a particularly close relative of the common redshank, but rather belongs to a high-latitude lineage of largish shanks. T. totanus on the other hand is closely related to the marsh sandpiper (T. stagnatilis), and closer still to the small wood sandpiper (T. glareola). The ancestors of the latter and the common redshank seem to have diverged around the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, about 5‚Äì6 million years ago. These three subarctic- to temperate- region species form a group of smallish shanks with have red or yellowish legs, and in breeding plumage are generally a subdued light brown above with some darker mottling, and have somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck.  Subspecies  Several subspecies have been identified. These include: * T. t. robusta - (Schi√∏ler, 1919): found in Iceland and the Faroe Islands. * T. t. ussuriensis - Buturlin, 1934: found in southern Siberia, Mongolia and east Asia * T. t. terrignotae - Meinertzhagen, R. & Meinertzhagen, A., 1926: found in southern Manchuria and eastern China * T. t. craggi - Hale, 1971: found in north west China * T. t. eurhina - (Oberholser, 1900): found in Tajikistan, north India and Tibet  Ecology  The common redshank is a widespread breeding bird across temperate Eurasia. It is a migratory species, wintering on coasts around the Mediterranean, on the Atlantic coast of Europe from Ireland and Great Britain southwards, and in South Asia. They are uncommon vagrants outside these areas; on Palau in Micronesia for example, the species was recorded in the mid-1970s and in 2000. Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden They are wary and noisy birds which will alert everything else with their loud piping call. Like most waders, they feed on small invertebrates. Redshanks will nest in any wetland, from damp meadows to saltmarsh, often at high densities. They lay 3‚Äì5 eggs. The common redshank is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African- Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. It is widely distributed and quite plentiful in some regions, and thus not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

It grazes mainly on grass and aquatic plants. It is the only extant member of the genus Elaphurus. Based on genetic comparisons, P√®re David's deer is closely related to the deer of the genus Cervus, leading many experts to suggest merging Elaphurus into Cervus, or demoting Elaphurus to a subgenus of Cervus. P√®re David's deer were hunted to extirpation in their native China during the late 19th century, but were saved from total extinction by Europeans who had taken specimens back to zoos in France and Germany and successfully bred the deer in captivity. In the early 20th century, the British nobleman and politician Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, acquired a few P√®re David's deer from the Berlin Zoo and built up a large herd on his estate at Woburn Abbey. In the 1980s, the Duke's great-grandson Robin Russell, 14th Duke of Bedford, donated several dozen deer to the Chinese government for reintroducing the species to the wild. As of 2015, the wild population in China was about 700 individuals. All P√®re David's deer alive today descend from the 11th Duke's original herd. Demography The P√®re David's deer is endemic to the Chinese region. According to fossil records, the species first appeared during the Pleistocene period, when it could be found anywhere in the Manchuria.Hofmann, R. R. 2007. The Milu (Elaphurus davidianus), a recently evolved Chinese ruminant species with a unique morphology pointing a specific ecological adaptation. In: J. Xia (ed.), The International Symposium on the 20th Anniversary of Milu Returning Home, pp. 119-122. Beijing Press, Beijing, China. This demography changed during the Holocene period; during this time, the species could only be found in the swamp lands and wetlands of southern China. Due to hunting and land reclamation, the demography of the P√®re David's deer became even smaller. By 1939, the last of the wild species were shot and killed.Zhou, K. 2007. Chinese Milu‚Äôs prosperity, decline and protection. In: J. Xia (ed.), The International Symposium on the 20th Anniversary of Milu Returning Home, pp. 15-19. Beijing Press, Beijing, China. Naming and etymology P√®re David's deer (female). This species of deer was first made known to Western science in 1866 by Armand David (P√®re David), a French missionary working in China. He obtained the carcasses of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris, where the species was named P√®re David's Deer by Alphonse Milne- Edwards, a French biologist. The species is sometimes known by its informal name sibuxiang (; Japanese: shifuz≈ç), literally meaning \\"four not alike\\", which could mean \\"the four unlikes\\" or \\"like none of the four\\"; it is variously said that the four are cow, deer, donkey, horse (or) camel, and that the expression means in detail: *\\"the hooves of a cow but not a cow, the neck of a camel but not a camel, antlers of a deer but not a deer, the tail of a donkey but not a donkey.\\" *\\"the nose of a cow but not a cow, the antlers of a deer but not a deer, the body of a donkey but not a donkey, tail of a horse but not a horse\\" *\\"the tail of a donkey, the head of a horse, the hoofs of a cow, the antlers of a deer\\" *\\"the neck of a camel, the hoofs of a cow, the tail of a donkey, the antlers of a deer\\" *\\"the antlers of a deer, the head of a horse and the body of a cow\\" By this name, this undomesticated animal entered Chinese mythology as the mount of Jiang Ziya in Fengshen Bang (translated as Investiture of the Gods), a Chinese classical work of fiction written during the Ming Dynasty. Characteristics P√®re David's deer (male) at Sharkarosa Ranch, 2014. The skeleton of stag(male) displayed at Kobe Oji Zoo on K≈çbe, Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan The adult P√®re David's deer reaches a head-and-body length of up to and stands about tall at the shoulder.Burnie, D. and Wilson, DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), The tail is relatively long for a deer, measuring when straightened. Weight is between . The head is long and slender with large eyes, very large preorbital glands, a naked nose pad and small, pointed ears. The branched antlers are unique in that the long tines point backward, while the main beam extends almost directly upward. There may be two pairs per year. The summer antlers are the larger set, and are dropped in November, after the summer rut. The second set‚Äîif they appear‚Äîare fully grown by January, and fall off a few weeks later. The coat is reddish tan in the summer, changing to a dull gray in the winter. Long wavy guard hairs are present on and coat throughout the year, with the coat becoming woolier in winter. There is a mane on the neck and throat and a black dorsal stripe running along the cervicothoracic spine. The tail is about in length, with a dark tuft at the end. The hooves are large and spreading, and make clicking sounds (as in the reindeer) when the animal is moving. A semiaquatic animal, P√®re David's deer swims well, spending long periods standing in water up to its shoulders. Although predominantly a grazer, the deer supplements its grass diet with aquatic plants in the summer.  Behavior  P√®re David's deer has similar reproductive physiological mechanisms to other deer species living in temperate latitudes. These mechanisms aid in the adaptation to a high-latitude environment. The reproductive behavior in stags differs from hinds. In stags rutting behavior includes urine sniffing, anogenital sniffing, wallowing, and antler adorning. Mating behavior includes mounting and copulating. Communication behavior includes the spraying of urine and preorbital gland marking. The stags generally begin to rut before any signs of female sexual behavior. The reason to this is to establish a social rank among the stags. For P√®re David's deer the stag initiates the breeding season with the rutting. In hinds, estrous behavior includes urinating frequently, receptivity, and allowing the stags to mount. Parental behavior involves sniffing the calf, calling, and rubbing the face of the calf. The hind has a typical behavior of being solitary. = Birth and lifespan = The gestation period is about nine months, roughly around 280 days, after which a single offspring is usually born; twins are born rarely. The gestation period is significantly longer than any other deer besides the roe deer. P√®re David's deer are considered seasonal breeders because three out of four calves are born during April in captive European populations. The breeding season is 160 days with the mating season usually being in June and July. Calf weight, calculated using Robbins and Robbins equation, tends to be between 11.3 and 13.2 kg. The juveniles (referred to as either fawns or calves) have a spotted coat, as is commonly seen in most species of deer. They are known to develop very quickly after birth. They reach sexual maturity at about 14 months. The average lifespan of a P√®re David deer is up to 18 years. = In captivity = An experiment was conducted to show how captivity would affect the deer's behavior and survival rate. Two areas were created; one with a large area containing a few P√®re David's deer present and one with a small area containing a high concentration of P√®re David's deer present. It was found when in captivity, it is best to keep the deer in large open areas that allow for adequate space with a reasonable number of individual deer living in the area; if put in a small area with a multitude of individuals present, stress amongst the deer will build up. Studies have shown through the high concentration of fecal matter in an area of captivity with limited space and a large number of P√®re David deer that they have shown different behavioral patterns to their wild counterparts. These deer would spend less time resting, and would stand longer due to human presence as well as display social aggression and competition over food sources. It is therefore unwise to keep them in small, densely populated areas to prevent accumulation of stress and aggression against each other.Li, Chunwang, et al. \\"Influence of enclosure size and animal density on fecal cortisol concentration and aggression in Pere David‚Äôs deer stags.\\" General and Comparative Endocrinology 151.2 (2007): 202-209. The P√®re David's deer has been in isolation from the wild for more than 1200 years, causing humans to be the primary perceived threat due to a long-term lack of exposure to other natural predators. When encountering humans, the deer's response varies according to sex. Female-only groups display a lower degree of caution towards humans than in male-only groups. It was hypothesized that the presence of a single type of threat may be sufficient to maintain anti-predator responses in the face of relaxed predation pressure. During rutting season, the does will display increased vigilance and heightened threat perception, likely in response to the mating activities of the males.Zheng, Wei, et al. \\"Determinants of vigilance in a reintroduced population of Pere David‚Äôs deer.\\" Curr Zool 59 (2013): 265-270. =Predation= Historically, the main predators of the P√®re David's deer are believed to have been tigers and leopards. Although they no longer encounter ancestral predators while living in captivity, while experimenting with exposures to images and stimuli relating to these big cats, the deer seemed to instinctively react with a cautious predator-prey response typical of wild deer. Population P√®re David's deer (male), with characteristic large preorbital glands, black dorsal stripe and large, spreading hooves. In neolithic times, the milu's range extended across much of China Proper. Archaeologists have found milu antlers at settlements from the Liao River in the north to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province and across the Yellow and Yangtze River Basins in Shaanxi and Hunan Province.(Chinese) ÁéãËïæ, È∫ãÈπø‰∏éÁã©Áåé 2007-12-17 =Extirpation in China= In the late 19th century, the world's only herd belonged to Tongzhi, the Emperor of China. The herd was maintained in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in Nan Haizi, near Peking. In 1895, one of the walls of the hunting garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the deer escaped and some of them were killed and eaten by starving peasants. Fewer than thirty P√®re David's Deer remained in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops from the German Empire and all the remaining deer were shot and eaten by the soldiers, leaving the P√®re David's deer extirpated in its native China.A few of the deer had been legallyNigel Sitwell, Pere David's Deer Return Home obtained by the French and British Missions in Beijing and transported to various European zoos for exhibition and breeding. After the extirpation of the Chinese population in 1900, the English nobleman Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, was instrumental in saving the species. He acquired the few remaining deer from European zoos and formed a breeding herd in the deer park at his home at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire. Threatened again by both World Wars, the species survived largely due to the efforts of Bedford and his son Hastings, later 12th Duke of Bedford. The current world population, now found in zoos around the world, stems from the Woburn Abbey herd. . Only three founders (1 male, two females) from the Berlin Zoo contributed to the current population of more than 5,000. =Reintroduction= Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve Reintroduction of P√®re David's deer to China began in 1985, with a herd of 20 deer (5 males and 15 females). This was followed in 1987 by a second herd, consisting of 18 deer (all females). Both herds had been drawn from the Woburn Abbey herd and were donated by Robin Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (d.2003) (the future 14th Duke of Bedford), the 11th Duke's great-grandson.Robin Russell, Marquess of Tavistock, was the son and heir apparent of John Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford (d.2002) who had become a tax exile in Monaco leaving the Bedford estates in England to be managed by his son In 2005 the Beijing authorities erected a statue of the 14th Duke at Nan Haizi to mark the 20th Anniversary of the Milu reintroduction. The transportation was sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund. The relic site of the Nanyuan (or Nan HaiziSouth China Morning Post announcing the arrival of the first herd of Milu in Beijing Aug. 26, 1985) Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re- introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park. The population in China expanded to around 2,000 in 2005. A second re-introduction into China was conducted in 1986 where 36 P√®re David's deer were chosen from five UK zoological gardens with the bulk of the deer coming from Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. These deer were introduced into Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve, near the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China. In 2006 the population at this Nature Reserve had reached around 950 with an average annual population increase of 17%. Of 1993, 30 deer taken from the herd at Beijing Milu Park were released into the Tian'ezhou Milu National Nature Reserve (a.k.a. Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve) in , Shishou. These were followed by another 34 deer taken from Beijing Park and released into the Tian'ezhou Reserve. In a 1998 flood, a number of deer escaped from the reserve and have since been living and multiplying in the wild. As of 2015, the number of deer living in the wild is 700.http://english.cri.cn/6566/2015/07/17/2821s887778.htm The average annual population growth rate for P√®re David's deer in Tianezhou Nature Reserve was 22.2%. In 2002, 30 deer taken from the herd at Beijing Milu Park and 20 from Dafeng Nature Reserve were released into the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve. When the species was assessed for the IUCN Red List (1996), it was classified as \\"critically endangered\\" in the wild, under criterion \\"D\\": \\"[wild] population estimated to number less than 50 mature individuals\\".The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species In October 2008, they were officially listed as extinct in the wild. Upon the status being updated in March 2016, it was clarified on this species‚Äô IUCN Red List page that it would remain listed as ‚ÄúExtinct in the Wild‚Äù until the reintroduced population proved long-term viability.https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/7121/22159785 Today, there are 53 herds of P√®re David's deer in China. Nine of the herds consist of 25 or under deer, and the remaining herds have under 10 deer.Yang, R., Zhang, L., Tan, B. and Zhong, Z. 2003. Investigation on the status of P√®re David‚Äôs deer in China. Chinese Journal of Zoology 38: 76~81. Due to the small population size a lack of genetic diversity is expected, but in spite of the small population size, the animals do not appear to suffer genetic problems from the genetic bottleneck. The captive population in China has increased in recent years, and the possibility remains that free-ranging populations can be reintroduced in the near future. When reintroduced into their habitat, the species could face many problems due to years in captivity. Relaxed selection and reproduction with no environmental pressure may have taken place for P√®re David's deer, due to captive breeding, which can result in the loss of adaptive anti-predator behavior. It is possible that when fully released in the environment from captivity, after generations of offspring, the species could be unable to retain parasite-defense behaviors like grooming. If the population is reintroduced into the environment with no protection against tick infestation then they can face major problems if not adapted to that environment. Since also no longer being adapted to other predators, such as tigers, it could cause confusion for the P√®re David's deer. They could have possibly lost the memories of their ancestral predators. Although, a study was done on the species that are in captivity using the sounds of tigers roaring and dogs barking and the deer did not respond to the barking of the dogs, but hearing the tiger roar caused the deer to spend more time being cautious after hearing the sound, thus showing that the deer still retained memories of their previous predator, the tiger. = Hybrid = Though New Zealand lacked its own terrestrial mammals, European settlers had introduced numerous species of deer into the land for the use of farming and hunting. Some of these deer species had crossbred in the wild, creating hybrids, which in turn were then utilized in deer farms based on their apparent genetic improvements. Alongside this discovery, deer farms began the practice of inciting hybridization in order to encourage genetic advancement. This includes a hybrid between P√®re David's deer and Red deer. These F1 hybrids are unique for several reasons. To begin with, both male and female offspring of this hybrid remain fertile, a rare prospect especially for species that have such a genetic distance. Both species differ in seasonal behaviors, gestation length, behavioral traits, morphology, maturity size, and disease resistance. P√®re David's deer is also unique in that its antlers are unlike any other deer in the world. However, due to having different seasonal behavior each species would enter their mating season at different intervals, thus preventing natural mating from occurring. In response, artificial insemination was employed on Red deer hinds with the semen from P√®re David's deer. These F1 hybrids did not share similar mating seasons with P√®re David's deer and as such were able to successfully mate with other red deer naturally. Three F1 hybrid stags successfully mated naturally in a period from 1989 to 1991 with 144 hinds and semen had been used to artificially inseminate 114 other Red deer hinds producing over 300 backcross hybrids. Legend and cultural significance Illustration of P√®re David's deer from Nouvelles Archives du Mus√©um d'histoire Naturelle, 1866 According to Chinese legend, when the tyrant King Zhou of Shang ruled the land more than 3,000 years ago, a horse, a donkey, an ox and a deer went into a cave in the forest to meditate and on the day the King executed his minister Bigan, the animals awoke from their meditation and turned into humans.(Chinese)È∫ãÈπøÊñáÂåñ--È∫ãÈπøÁöÑ‰º†ËØ¥ 2012-04-11 They entered society, learned of the King's heinous acts and wanted to take recourse against the King, who was powerful. So they transformed themselves into one creature that combined the speed of the horse, the strength of the ox, the donkey's keen sense of direction and the nimble agility of the deer. This new animal then galloped to the Kunlun Mountains to seek the advice of the Primeval Lord of Heaven. The Lord was astonished at the sight of a creature that had antlers of a deer, hooves of an ox, face of a horse and tail of a donkey. \\"It's unlike any of four creatures!\\" he exclaimed. Upon learning of the animal's quest, Lord gave his blessing and dispatched the creature to his disciple the sage Jiang Ziya, who was battling the King. Jiang Ziya rode the creature to victory over the King and helped found the Zhou Dynasty. After fulfilling its vow, the milu settled in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The animal became a symbol of good fortune and was sought by later emperors who believed eating the meat of the milu would lead to everlasting life.

In a nearby location lies the shrines of Muslim leaders Sheik Muhammad Rabiah and Sheik Mahmud who fought against the Crusaders. The Auba cave, which dates from the time of the Assyrians, is also located here.Welcome To Nahf Notable structures The largest medieval structure in the village is a roughly 10 meter long wall, made of large drafted blocks with a rubble core, which may be of Crusader origin.Petersen, 2001, p. 239 The Maqam (shrine) of Shaykh Rabi is located on a steep hill above the village, surrounded by a cemetery. It is a domed rectangular building, with an entrance from the east. A deep mihrab (\\"Islamic prayer niche\\") is located inside, in the middle of the south side. By the north wall is the elongated cenotaph of Shaykh Rabi.

In the context of an entire economy, resources can be allocated by various means, such as markets or planning. In project management, resource allocation or resource management is the scheduling of activities and the resources required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time. Economics In economics, the area of public finance deals with three broad areas: macroeconomic stabilization, the distribution of income and wealth, and the allocation of resources. Much of the study of the allocation of resources is devoted to finding the conditions under which particular mechanisms of resource allocation lead to Pareto efficient outcomes, in which no party's situation can be improved without hurting that of another party. Strategic planning In strategic planning, resource allocation is a plan for using available resources, for example human resources, especially in the near term, to achieve goals for the future. It is the process of allocating scarce resources among the various projects or business units. There are a number of approaches to solving resource allocation problems e.g. resources can be allocated using a manual approach, an algorithmic approach (see below),Production planning \\"Algorithmic sequencing\\" Production planning Retrieved on 3 June 2014 or a combination of both.Inteng \\"Planning manual and algorithm\\" Inteng Retrieved on 3 June 2014 There may be contingency mechanisms such as a priority ranking of items excluded from the plan, showing which items to fund if more resources should become available and a priority ranking of some items included in the plan, showing which items should be sacrificed if total funding must be reduced. Algorithms Resource allocation may be decided by using computer programs applied to a specific domain to automatically and dynamically distribute resources to applicants. This is especially common in electronic devices dedicated to routing and communication. For example, channel allocation in wireless communication may be decided by a base transceiver station using an appropriate algorithm. One class of resource whereby applicants bid for the best resource(s) according to their balance of \\"money\\", as in an online auction business model (see also auction theory). A study by Emmanuel Yarteboi Annan shows that this is highly important in the resource allocation sector.

History Ishwa was an ancient village, situated at the foot of a hill.Dauphin, 1998, p. 902 It is thought to have been established over the site of the Canaanite city of Eshta'ol. It was known by that name during the Roman Empire era, when it fell within the administrative district of Eleutheropolis (Bayt Jibrin).

The manufacture of carbon paper was formerly the largest consumer of montan wax. In 1954 the Columbia Ribbon & Carbon Manufacturing Company filed a patent for what became known in the trade as solvent carbon paper: the coating was changed from wax-based to polymer- based. The manufacturing process changed from a hot-melt method to a solvent- applied coating or set of coatings. It was then possible to use polyester or other plastic film as a substrate, instead of paper, although the name remained carbon paper.  History  In 1801, Pellegrino Turri, an Italian inventor, invented carbon paper to provide the ink for his mechanical typing machine, one of the first typewriters. Ralph Wedgwood obtained the first patent for carbon paper in 1806. Carbon paper was the principal medium of reproduction for samizdat, a publication method used in the former Soviet Union in order to publish books without having to use state-controlled printing houses and risk the censorship or imprisonment that was commonplace at the time. While the use of carbon paper has declined to almost nothing, a legacy of its once widespread use has remained in the header of emails, where the abbreviation \\"cc\\" stands for \\"carbon copies\\", the copies intended for recipients other than the principal addressee.  Fuel cell application  Carbon paper is also used in fuel cell applications. However, this carbon paper has nothing to do with the carbon paper used for copying texts. It consists of carbon microfibers manufactured into flat sheets. It is used to help as an electrode that facilitates diffusion of reagents across the catalyst layered membrane portion of membrane electrode assembly.  Other uses  The advent of word-processing and the decline of typewriting meant that any number of copies of a document could be printed on demand, and the decline of carbon paper, which had already been partially superseded by photocopying and carbonless copy paper, became irrevocable. A few specialist or remnant uses remain. Examples of these are receipts at point of sale (though they have mostly been relegated to being backups for when electronic POS devices fail) or for on-the-spot fine notices, duplicate checks, and some money orders (though the United States Postal Service has recently converted to an electronic format), and tracking slips for various expedited mail services requiring multiple copies. In India, form-filling is on a sufficient scale that carbon paper is still widely used. As of 2013, in Canada only one eight-person company still manufactures carbon paper, in the United Kingdom one company and in the United States only two small companies. There have been some experimental uses of carbon paper in art (as a surface for painting) and mail art (to decorate envelopes). Carbon paper is commonly used to transfer patterns onto glass in the creation of stained glass . Carbon paper disks are still used in school physics labs as parts of experiments on projectile motion or position, velocity, and acceleration.

The Jordan curve (drawn in black) divides the plane into an \\"inside\\" region (light blue) and an \\"outside\\" region (pink). In topology, a Jordan curve, sometimes called a plane simple closed curve, is a non-self-intersecting continuous loop in the plane. The Jordan curve theorem asserts that every Jordan curve divides the plane into an \\"interior\\" region bounded by the curve and an \\"exterior\\" region containing all of the nearby and far away exterior points, so that every continuous path connecting a point of one region to a point of the other intersects with that loop somewhere. While the statement of this theorem seems to be intuitively obvious, it takes some ingenuity to prove it by elementary means. \\"Although the JCT is one of the best known topological theorems, there are many, even among professional mathematicians, who have never read a proof of it.\\" (). More transparent proofs rely on the mathematical machinery of algebraic topology, and these lead to generalizations to higher-dimensional spaces. The Jordan curve theorem is named after the mathematician Camille Jordan (1838‚Äì1922), who found its first proof. For decades, mathematicians generally thought that this proof was flawed and that the first rigorous proof was carried out by Oswald Veblen. However, this notion has been overturned by Thomas C. Hales and others.  Definitions and the statement of the Jordan theorem  A Jordan curve or a simple closed curve in the plane R2 is the image C of an injective continuous map of a circle into the plane, œÜ: S1 ‚Üí R2. A Jordan arc in the plane is the image of an injective continuous map of a closed and bounded interval into the plane. It is a plane curve that is not necessarily smooth nor algebraic. Alternatively, a Jordan curve is the image of a continuous map œÜ: [0,1] ‚Üí R2 such that œÜ(0) = œÜ(1) and the restriction of œÜ to [0,1) is injective. The first two conditions say that C is a continuous loop, whereas the last condition stipulates that C has no self-intersection points. With these definitions, the Jordan curve theorem can be stated as follows: > Let C be a Jordan curve in the plane R2. Then its complement, R2 \\\\ C, > consists of exactly two connected components. One of these components is > bounded (the interior) and the other is unbounded (the exterior), and the > curve C is the boundary of each component. In contrast, the complement of a Jordan arc in the plane is connected.  Proof and generalizations  The Jordan curve theorem was independently generalized to higher dimensions by H. Lebesgue and L.E.J. Brouwer in 1911, resulting in the Jordan‚ÄìBrouwer separation theorem. > Let X be an n-dimensional topological sphere in the (n+1)-dimensional > Euclidean space Rn+1 (n > 0), i.e. the image of an injective continuous > mapping of the n-sphere Sn into Rn+1. Then the complement Y of X in Rn+1 > consists of exactly two connected components. One of these components is > bounded (the interior) and the other is unbounded (the exterior). The set X > is their common boundary. The proof uses homology theory. It is first established that, more generally, if X is homeomorphic to the k-sphere, then the reduced integral homology groups of Y = Rn+1 \\\\ X are as follows: : \\\\tilde{H}_{q}(Y)= \\\\begin{cases}\\\\mathbb{Z},\\\\quad q=n-k\\\\text{ or }n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0,\\\\quad \\\\text{otherwise}.\\\\end{cases} This is proved by induction in k using the Mayer‚ÄìVietoris sequence. When n = k, the zeroth reduced homology of Y has rank 1, which means that Y has 2 connected components (which are, moreover, path connected), and with a bit of extra work, one shows that their common boundary is X. A further generalization was found by J. W. Alexander, who established the Alexander duality between the reduced homology of a compact subset X of Rn+1 and the reduced cohomology of its complement. If X is an n-dimensional compact connected submanifold of Rn+1 (or Sn+1) without boundary, its complement has 2 connected components. There is a strengthening of the Jordan curve theorem, called the Jordan‚ÄìSch√∂nflies theorem, which states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a Jordan curve in R2 are homeomorphic to the interior and exterior of the unit disk. In particular, for any point P in the interior region and a point A on the Jordan curve, there exists a Jordan arc connecting P with A and, with the exception of the endpoint A, completely lying in the interior region. An alternative and equivalent formulation of the Jordan‚ÄìSch√∂nflies theorem asserts that any Jordan curve œÜ: S1 ‚Üí R2, where S1 is viewed as the unit circle in the plane, can be extended to a homeomorphism œà: R2 ‚Üí R2 of the plane. Unlike Lebesgue‚Äôs and Brouwer's generalization of the Jordan curve theorem, this statement becomes false in higher dimensions: while the exterior of the unit ball in R3 is simply connected, because it retracts onto the unit sphere, the Alexander horned sphere is a subset of R3 homeomorphic to a sphere, but so twisted in space that the unbounded component of its complement in R3 is not simply connected, and hence not homeomorphic to the exterior of the unit ball.  History and further proofs  The statement of the Jordan curve theorem may seem obvious at first, but it is a rather difficult theorem to prove. It is easy to establish this result for polygons, but the problem came in generalizing it to all kinds of badly behaved curves, which include nowhere differentiable curves, such as the Koch snowflake and other fractal curves, or even a Jordan curve of positive area constructed by . The first proof of this theorem was given by Camille Jordan in his lectures on real analysis, and was published in his book Cours d'analyse de l'√âcole Polytechnique. There is some controversy about whether Jordan's proof was complete: the majority of commenters on it have claimed that the first complete proof was given later by Oswald Veblen, who said the following about Jordan's proof: :His proof, however, is unsatisfactory to many mathematicians. It assumes the theorem without proof in the important special case of a simple polygon, and of the argument from that point on, one must admit at least that all details are not given. However, Thomas C. Hales wrote: :Nearly every modern citation that I have found agrees that the first correct proof is due to Veblen... In view of the heavy criticism of Jordan‚Äôs proof, I was surprised when I sat down to read his proof to find nothing objectionable about it. Since then, I have contacted a number of the authors who have criticized Jordan, and each case the author has admitted to having no direct knowledge of an error in Jordan‚Äôs proof. Hales also pointed out that the special case of simple polygons is not only an easy exercise, but was not really used by Jordan anyway, and quoted Michael Reeken as saying: :Jordan‚Äôs proof is essentially correct... Jordan‚Äôs proof does not present the details in a satisfactory way. But the idea is right, and with some polishing the proof would be impeccable. Earlier, Jordan's proof and another early proof by Charles Jean de la Vall√©e Poussin had already been critically analyzed and completed by Schoenflies (1924). Due to the importance of the Jordan curve theorem in low-dimensional topology and complex analysis, it received much attention from prominent mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century. Various proofs of the theorem and its generalizations were constructed by J. W. Alexander, Louis Antoine, Ludwig Bieberbach, Luitzen Brouwer, Arnaud Denjoy, Friedrich Hartogs, B√©la Ker√©kj√°rt√≥, Alfred Pringsheim, and Arthur Moritz Schoenflies. New elementary proofs of the Jordan curve theorem, as well as simplifications of the earlier proofs, continue to be carried out. * Elementary proofs were presented by and . * A proof using non- standard analysis by . * A proof using constructive mathematics by . * A proof using the Brouwer fixed point theorem by . * A proof using non-planarity of the complete bipartite graph K3,3 was given by .

It is relatively simple to prove that the Jordan curve theorem holds for every Jordan polygon (Lemma 1), and every Jordan curve can be approximated arbitrarily well by a Jordan polygon (Lemma 2). A Jordan polygon is a polygonal chain, the boundary of a bounded connected open set, call it the open polygon, and its closure, the closed polygon. Consider the diameter \\\\delta of the largest disk contained in the closed polygon. Evidently, \\\\delta is positive. Using a sequence of Jordan polygons (that converge to the given Jordan curve) we have a sequence \\\\delta_1, \\\\delta_2, \\\\dots presumably converging to a positive number, the diameter \\\\delta of the largest disk contained in the closed region bounded by the Jordan curve. However, we have to prove that the sequence \\\\delta_1, \\\\delta_2, \\\\dots does not converge to zero, using only the given Jordan curve, not the region presumably bounded by the curve. This is the point of Tverberg's Lemma 3. Roughly, the closed polygons should not thin to zero everywhere. Moreover, they should not thin to zero somewhere, which is the point of Tverberg's Lemma 4. The first formal proof of the Jordan curve theorem was created by in the HOL Light system, in January 2005, and contained about 60,000 lines. Another rigorous 6,500-line formal proof was produced in 2005 by an international team of mathematicians using the Mizar system. Both the Mizar and the HOL Light proof rely on libraries of previously proved theorems, so these two sizes are not comparable. showed that in reverse mathematics the Jordan curve theorem is equivalent to the weak K√∂nig's lemma over the system \\\\mathsf{RCA}_0.

Location The village was situated west of Jenin, on the top of a small circular plateau that extended from the northern slope of a mountain (Jabal Faqqu'a). It overlooked the Jordan Valley to the north and northeast, and was linked by a dirt path to the village Tall al- Shawk in District of Baysan.Khalidi, 1992, p. 333 History =British period= In the British mandate period the village was classified as a hamlet by the Palestine Index Gazetteer. It was probably occupied by the forces of the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Gideon on 12 May 1948. Most of its population fled to Jenin and its surrounding areas after the Israeli forces overtook the city of Bisan on 15 May 1948. =Israeli period= According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the 1948 armistice line separating Israel from the West Bank fell a short distance to the west of Khirbat al- Jawfa, cutting through the land of the nearby village of Faqqu'a (in the West Bank). The land of this village that was inside Israel have been combined with the land that belonged to Khirbat al-Jawfa, making the two indistinguishable. The kibbutz of Ma'ale Gilboa, founded 1962, is located inside this amalgamated parcel of land, southwest of the village site. Khalidi described the village remaining structures in 1992 as: \\"Although sections of some walls still stand, most of the former houses have been reduced to rubble. The entire area has been fenced in and is used as a grazing area for cows. A large water tank belonging to kibbutz Ma'ale Gilbo'a is on the site\\".

Along with entertainment magazine Next Magazine, Apple Daily is part of Next Digital. The paper publishes print and digital editions in Chinese, as well as a digital-only English edition. In a Reuters Institute poll conducted in January 2019, the Apple Daily newspaper and its news website were the second most used in Hong Kong. The survey shows it was the third least trusted major source of news in the same year. However, according to a survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Apple Daily was the third most trusted paid newspaper in 2019. The reporting and editorials of Apple Daily have been described as favouring the Hong Kong pan-democracy camp and critical of the Chinese government. As a result of its editorial position, it was subject to advertising boycotts and political pressure. After the controversial Hong Kong national security law was enacted, its headquarters faced a widely condemned police raid on 10 August 2020. A sister publication of the same name is published in Taiwan under a joint venture between Next Media and other Taiwanese companies.  History  Apple Daily was founded on 20 June 1995 by garment businessman Jimmy Lai. After the success of Next Magazine, another publication owned by Lai, he launched Apple Daily with an initial capital of HK$700 million. Lai named Apple Daily after the forbidden fruit, which he said if Adam and Eve did not eat, there would be no evil and news. The newspaper launched against a poor economy and a competitive Chinese- language newspaper market. Political uncertainties from Lai's criticisms of the Chinese government also made media analysts pessimistic about the future of Apple Daily. Before Apple Daily was first published, it launched a television advertisements that portrayed Lai with an apple on his head being a shooting target for its competitors. In the first month of publication, the newspaper gave out coupons to reduce the price in effect to $2, despite the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong standardising the retail price of Hong Kong newspapers to $5 per issue. The price was returned to $5 after a month, but the newspaper began giving out T-shirts and coloured posters. The free publicity allowed Apple Daily to sell 200,000 copies on its first day and become the newspaper with the second highest circulation in Hong Kong. A price war between popular newspapers began in response to Apple Daily's competition within months of its launch. Oriental Daily announced it would reduce its price to $2 from $5 in December 1995, and other newspapers, such as Sing Pao and Tin Tin Daily followed suit. Apple Daily reduced its retail price to $4 a day after Oriental Daily's announcement and had a 10 per cent drop in its circulation. The price war caused multiple newspapers to collapse, including TV Daily, which ceased operations on the first day of the price war, Hong Kong United Daily, China Times Magazine and English newspaper Eastern Express, a sister newspaper of Oriental Daily. The newspaper was modelled after USA Today, with printing in full colour and concise writing. It also extensively used written Cantonese, when most Hong Kong newspapers used written vernacular Chinese, and a focus on reporting crime, celebrity news, eroticism, gambling, and drug use. It carried at least three pages of entertainment news at the beginning but this was increased by eight pages by 2000. In March 2015, Chan Pui-man became the first female chief editor of the journal, replacing Ip Yut- kin. In 2019, Apple Daily was an award winner of the Hong Kong Human Rights Press Awards for their reporting on Liu Xia, the wife of Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo. In 2020, Apple Daily launched the English edition of its digital newspaper.  Content  Apple Daily is described to have introduced tabloid journalism to the Hong Kong market. The focus on large colourful graphics and more flamboyant stories, such as celebrity scandals, traffic accidents and deaths, quickly made Apple Daily Hong Kong's second most popular newspaper. This type of journalism has also been replicated by other newspapers in Hong Kong. Apple Daily attracted public criticism in 1998 for a report about a woman who jumped off a building after pushing her children out the window. The woman's husband was widely reported to have little remorse for the deaths of his wife and children. Apple Daily published a photo of the man with two prostitutes soon after the deaths. It was then revealed that the newspaper had paid the man to pose for the photograph, for which Apple Daily issued an apology after public outcry. In the same year, Apple Daily ran a front-page article claiming that lawyer Jessie Chu Siu Kuk-yuen absconded more than of clients' money her law firm. Apple Daily was ordered by a court to pay Chu more than in damages for defamation. In 2000, an Apple Daily reporter was sentenced to 10 months in jail for bribing police officers for information on criminal cases. Journalism scholar Paul Lee said the establishment of Apple Daily has changed the Hong Kong newspaper ecosystem by transforming broadsheet newspapers into tabloids. Lee said newspapers with a high circulation, such as Apple Daily, The Sun and Oriental Daily, are known for their tabloid journalism as well as making mainstream reporting (see middle-market newspaper). Apple Daily did not join the self-regulation panel of the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong. Apple Daily is also known for its coverage of breaking news and current affairs in Hong Kong and China. The newspaper had exclusive reports on political scandals, including a former member of the Legislative Council not reporting conflict of interest in 2000, a former Financial Secretary Antony Leung for avoiding tax when purchasing a car. = Editorial position = Apple Daily favours the Hong Kong pan-democracy camp. Its criticism of the Hong Kong government has been described as a marketing strategy. The newspaper is also said to have sensationalised politics to produce public dissent. In 2003, Apple Daily was critical of the Tung Chee-hwa administration and published news articles that encouraged readers to participate in pro-democracy demonstrations with its front-page headline. Apple Daily launched a social media campaign in support of student protesters in the 2014 Hong Kong protests and its social media presence was considered a mainstream pro-activist community. Apple Daily is also described as critical of China. In 2004, it was the only newspaper in Hong Kong that expressed optimism when Chen Shui-bian was re-elected President of the Republic of China. The editorial position against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments has resulted in advertising boycotts. In 2003, several major property developers in Hong Kong ended their advertisements in the newspaper. According to Mark Simon, an executive of Next Digital, HSBC, Hang Seng and Standard Chartered stopped their advertising campaigns in the newspaper in 2013 due to pressure from the Chinese government's Liaison Office. The Liaison Office denied it contacted the banks, and the banks said they pulled advertising for commercial reasons. Apple Daily also said Chinese-sponsored hackers have attacked it almost every week. FireEye said in 2014 that denial-of-service attacks on Apple Daily were connected with professional cyberattacks, that may be coordinated by the Chinese government.  National security law raid  On 10 August 2020, the Hong Kong offices of Apple Daily were searched by over 200 national security officers in a large-scale police raid, following Lai's arrest for alleged violations of the recently implemented national security law. Lai's two sons, along with four senior executives of Next Digital and three social activists, were also arrested on the same day. The arrests came amid Beijing's ongoing crackdown against many pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong, which drew condemnation from international governments and human rights groups. Lai and other arrestees reportedly faced charges of \\"foreign collusion\\", which included advocating for foreign sanctions, based on the broad definitions of the national security law. Earlier in the week, the United States had placed sanctions on 11 high-profile Hong Kong officials involved in the city's democratic suppression. The police raid lasted nine hours, as the officers rifled through the business property and carted off 25 boxes of evidence. The police had a search warrant and did not disclose what they were looking for in the headquarters. The police also brought Lai to the office for two and a half hours, where he was paraded through the newsroom in handcuffs. Some critics believed this public demonstration was aimed to humiliate Lai in an effort to silence the press. The raid was documented in a live stream by Apple Daily's reporters, watched by thousands of online viewers. The streaming footage included a tense moment when the policed shoved an editor for questioning the boundaries of the search. The police also ordered for the live broadcast to be stopped, but the staff member stated that \\"it is our duty to report\\" and continued filming the raid. Next Digital released a statement condemning the police raid and declared, \\"Hong Kong's press freedom is now hanging by a thread, but our staff will remain fully committed to our duty to defend the freedom of the press.\\" An anonymous journalist from Apple Daily said the arrests were about \\"revenge\\" due to the newspaper's outspoken reporting on Beijing and the Hong Kong government, with another journalist stating that the intended goal was to shut down the news outlet. = Police conduct = Media access was restricted during the raid, with only \\"trusted media\\" sources granted accessibility based on the police's judgment of professionalism and objectivity. Several police news conferences were conducted to provide updates about the search, but numerous reporters were barred from attendance, including foreign news outlets like Reuters, Associated Press, and Agence France-Presse, along with local news sources like RTHK and Stand News. The media outlets attending these conferences were not allowed to ask questions. During the raid, the Next Media Trade Union strongly opposed the police reading through the confidential news materials in the newsroom. Steve Li Kwai-wah, the Senior Superintendent from the new National Security Department, said they searched the area since one of the arrestees had an office on the assigned floor. Li also said the officers only \\"scanned\\" the materials to confirm their relevance to the case. Legal scholar Johannes Chan later criticised the move, stating that even a quick scan jeopardised the confidentiality in news reporting. = International response = International communities responded to Apple Daily's raid with condemnation, with global organisations highlighting the erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong. Amnesty International spoke against the harassment of journalists, and called for all criminal charges related to the national security law to be dropped. The Asia Chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA- Asia) expressed their support for Apple Daily, and urged Hong Kong's leaders to uphold the values of free speech. Keith Richburg, a journalism professor at the University of Hong Kong, described the \\"frightening prospect\\" for journalists to operate under the national security law. Christophe Deloire, the Secretary General at Reporters Without Borders, said that \\"the Hong Kong government clearly seeks to take down a symbolic figure of press freedom.\\" The Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) in Hong Kong was also critical about the police's obstruction of news coverage during the raid, raising worries about propaganda in the absence of press freedom. Human Rights Watch stated that the raid on Apple Daily may be motivated by a desire to censor an independent Chinese media outlet. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said the national security law was used to \\"suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom\\", and called for Lai's immediate release. Activist groups in Taiwan advocated for further international sanctions on Chinese government officials to support the arrestees. Government officials around the world condemned Lai's arrest and the police raid on Apple Daily. Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, expressed her disappointment over the continuous erosion of Hong Kong's human rights and democracy. Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, said that Beijing eviscerated Hong Kong's freedoms. Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, voiced grave concern over Hong Kong's situation following the arrests. In contrast, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian approved of the mass arrests on the pro- democracy figures, stating that the Chinese government supported the national security law. = Aftermath = After the raid, the executives at Apple Daily vowed to resume their daily operations. Following a surge of popular demand, Apple Daily planned to produce 350,000 printed copies for their Tuesday publication, which was a significant increase from their daily circulation of 70,000 copies. The amount subsequently increased to 550,000 printed copies. The launch of a social media campaign encouraged readers to buy the newspaper, backed by activist Joshua Wong, singer Pong Nan, and lawmaker Ted Hui. Apple Daily also uploaded a live stream of their print production process, which was watched by thousands of viewers. On 11 August, the Tuesday newspaper was published with the front-page headline declaring, \\"Apple Daily must fight on.\\" Tsang Chi-ho, the former presenter of satirical news show Headliner, included a blank space in his regular column that simply said, \\"You can't kill us all.\\" Many Hong Kong residents lined up overnight at newspaper vendors to buy the first printed copies. Readers also purchased the newspapers in bulk, distributing free copies around the city. Within hours, multiple convenience stores had sold out all their copies. The publication's popularity came from readers who wanted to show their support towards Apple Daily and preserve the press freedom in Hong Kong. On the day of the arrests, Next Digital's shares originally fell up to 16.7% at a record low of HK$0.075. An online campaign then emerged, which encouraged supporters to purchase stock in the company. Following the campaign, the stock experienced a 1100% gain over the next two days, creating a record high in the past seven years. On Tuesday, the stock closed at HK$1.10 and became the third highest performer on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that day. On Wednesday, the shares fell over 40% after the Securities and Futures Commission issued a warning about the high volatility. Lai was released in the early morning of 12 August after 40 hours in detainment. Later that day, he arrived at the Apple Daily newsroom, where Lai was met with cheers from employees. Lai encouraged his staff members, \\"Let‚Äôs fight on! We have the support of the Hong Kong people. We can‚Äôt let them down.\\"  Awards and recognition   Editor-in-Chief  # Loh Chan (1995‚Äì1996) #Ip Yut Kin (1996‚Äì2002) # Lam Ping Hang (2003‚Äì2006) # Cheng Ming Yan (2006‚Äì2011) # Cheung Kim-hung (2012‚Äì2015) # Chan Pui-man (2015‚Äì2017) # Ryan Law Wai-kwong (2017‚Äì)  See also  * Media in Hong Kong * Newspapers of Hong Kong  References  External links * * Category:Chinese-language newspapers published in Hong Kong Category:Next Digital Category:Publications established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in Hong Kong ","title":"Apple Daily"},{"id":"267449","text":"Sakhnin (; or Sikhnin) is an Arab city in Israel's Northern District.

College of Sakhnin for Teacher Education  History  Sakhnin in the autumn Settlement at Sakhnin dates back 3,500 years to its first mention in 1479 BCE by Thutmose II, whose ancient Egyptian records mention it as a centre for production of indigo dye. Sakhnin is situated on an ancient site, where remains from columns and cisterns have been found.Dauphin, 1998, pp. 663-664 It was mentioned as Sogane, a town fortified in 66, by Josephus.Tsafrir et al, 1994, p. 235 A cistern, excavated near the mosque in the old city centre, revealed pottery fragments dating from the 1st to the 5th century CE.Tahan, 2005, Sakhnin Haninah ben Teradion, who was arrested by the Roman authorities for heresy (minut),Joshua Schwartz, Peter J.

It may be the village Kfar Sikhnin referred to in rabbinical accounts of the aftermath of the trial of the tanna Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus for heresy. Once the case was dismissed Rabbi Akiva came to visit and asked him if he had ever been pleased in hearing some teaching from a heretic. this query prompted Eliezer to recall an encounter on the road of Sepphoris, with a certain Yaakov from Kfar Sikhnin. Yaakov referred to him a teaching from Yeshua ben Pantiri/Yeshu ha-notsri, usually identified as Jesus, which Eliezer admits pleased him.Schwartz, Tomson, 'When Rabbi Eliezer was arrested for heresy,' 2012 p.6 n.15. In 1961 the biblical archaeologist Bellarmino Bagatti, during a visit to the village, was shown a tomb venerated by Christians, Jews and Muslims, which local tradition identified as that of James the Just. On returning to the village, he discovered that restoration had been undertaken and the site renamed the burial place of Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin. Richard Bauckham has raised the possibility that the Yaakov of Sikhnin in accounts of rabbi Eliezer may be James the grandson of Jude.Richard Bauckham, Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015 p.116.

It finally fell without battle during Operation Hiram, 29‚Äì31 October 1948. Many of the inhabitants fled north but some stayed and were not expelled by the Israeli soldiers.Morris, 1987, p. 226 The town remained under martial law until 1966. In 1976, it became the site of the first Land Day marches, in which six Israeli Arabs were killed by Israeli forces during violent protests of government expropriation of of Arab-owned land near Sakhnin. Later that same year, three more civilians were killed during clashes with the police. Two natives of the city were killed in Jerusalem during the al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000.

See Deep Water Bay.  Repulse Bay Beach  Repulse Bay Beach (), traditionally Hong Kong's most popular because of its easy access by bus and extensive facilities, is located on southern Hong Kong Island. See Repulse Bay.  Middle Bay Beach and South Bay Beach  These two small beaches at South Bay and Middle Bay are located within walking distance of Repulse Bay Beach. However, since they are not directly accessible by public transport, they tend to be quieter and less crowded than Repulse Bay.  Turtle Cove Beach  The beach situated east of Stanley and west of Tai Tam Reservoir is Turtle Cove Beach () which is a Grade 1 beach. Being less than 70 meters long, it can easily be considered as a \\"baby beach\\". Turtle Cove is very well equipped; with changing rooms, toilets and showers as well as a small playground, a soft drinks kiosk and seven barbecue pits. Turtle Cove Beach is accessible by bus No.14 from exit A of the Sai Wan Ho MTR station or mini-bus 16X from Chai Wan; the beach is located near the Red Hill estate stop (past the Tai Tam Reservoir). From near the bus stop, stairs lead down the hill to the beach.  Big Wave Bay Beach Big Wave Bay Beach () in Southern District is also the site of prehistoric rock carvings similar to those found on Cheung Chau Island.C.Michael Hogan, 2007, Cheung Chau Rock Carvings, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham Not to be confused with other places called Big Wave Bay or Tai Long Wan in Hong Kong. = Lamma Island =  Hung Shing Yeh Beach  Hung Shing Yeh Beach () is the most popular beach on Lamma Island. The sand on the beach is very fine, like powder. The water of the Beach is clean and it is classified as a Grade 1 beach. Near the beach, there is a barbecue area, refreshment kiosk, and shower and changing facilities. There is no public transport on Lamma Island. To reach the beach one must travel to Yung Shue Wan from Central by ferry, and then walk for about 20 minutes. The route is signposted.  Lo So Shing Beach  Lo So Shing Beach () is located on Lamma Island about halfway between the main villages of Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan. The water of the beach is clean and it is classified as a Grade 1 beach. Some years ago the government of Hong Kong built shower and refreshment facilities there, which remain almost unused because of the beach's remote location and the absence of public transport. To reach the beach one must travel to Yung Shue Wan or Sok Kwu Wan from Central by ferry, and then walk for about 40 minutes. = Cheung Chau =  Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach and Kwun Yam Beach  Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach There are two main beaches on Cheung Chau: Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach () and Kwun Yam Beach () aka. Afternoon Beach. Although they are not as big as the well- known beaches along the Hong Kong Island coast, they do have their own qualities. Kwun Yam Beach is a beautiful fine white beach situated on the east coast of Cheung Chau. The water quality is good and it is classified as a Grade 1 beach. It provides many water sports facilities, particularly for sailboarding. Many lovers like to take leisurely walks there and to enjoy the village scene which still keeps the old traditions. Also, it is the place where Hong Kong's first Olympic medallist, Lee Lai Shan, practised when she was young. A formal monument to her achievement is erected in the children's playground on Tung Wan Beach, while an unofficial monument is to be found beside the \\"windsurfer\\" caf√© owned by her uncle, which is situated between the two beaches. = Lantau Island =  Silvermine Bay Beach  Silvermine Bay Beach Hong Kong's largest island, Lantau, has several beaches which are clean, uncrowded and relatively convenient to reach. For all of them, the first step is to simply take the ferry from Central to Mui Wo. Then, if necessary, one can just hop on a bus. Silvermine Bay Beach (), which is a Grade 1 beach, is the easiest one to get to, since it is located about a 5-minute walk away from the Mui Wo ferry pier. Since there is a sandbar area, this beach is ideal for flinging frisbees or flying kites. Further along the beach is a swimming area with several lifeguards on duty. Many visitors rent a bike for the afternoon, and stop off at the many refreshment kiosks and little restaurants along the road fronting the beach. If people do not feel like hurrying back into the city, they can also choose to stay overnight at the Silvermine Beach Hotel, located right on the waterfront. Also, there are several other hotels and guesthouses in the area where people can stay.  Pui O Beach   Cheung Sha Beaches  View over Lower Cheung Sha Beach. The islet in the middle of the bay is Cha Kwo Chau (). Cheung Sha Beach is located in Cheung Sha, on the southern shore of Lantau Island. It is divided into two parts by a small headland: Upper Cheung Sha Beach (east) and Lower Cheung Sha Beach (west). It is 3 km long and is one of the longest beaches in Hong Kong.Time Out Hong Kong: \\"Get Out: Cheung Sha Beach\\" , 8 May 2009 The beaches are accessible from South Lantau Road.Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Lower Cheung Sha Beach Tong Fuk Beach is located nearby, to the west of Lower Cheung Sha Beach.  Tong Fuk Beach   Non- gazetted beaches  Many of these beaches are difficult to reach. Because they are not maintained by the government, some may be unclean at times. As no lifeguards are on duty, swimmers are recommended to exercise caution. Non- gazetted beaches are also not equipped with shark nets. #Chung Wan () South Crooked Harbour, North District #Cheung Sha Wan () Northeast Ping Chau #Crescent Bay () Crescent Island, Mirs Bay #Lo Kei Wan () Crescent Island, Mirs Bay #Tung Wan () Wong Wan Chau, Mirs Bay #Wu Kai Sha () Wu Kai Sha, Ma On Shan #Lung Mei () Plover Cove, East Tai Po #Hoi Ha Wan () Hoi Ha Wan, North Sai Kung Peninsula #Nam She Wan () East Sai Kung, Mirs Bay #Tung Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Tai Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Ham Tin Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Tai Long Sai Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Long Ke Wan () Long Ke Wan, East Sai Kung #Long Ke Tsai () Long Ke Wan, East Sai Kung #Pak Sha Chau () Sai Kung Hoi, Sai Kung #Pak Lap Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Ma Tau Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Kam Lo Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Nam Fung Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Kau Sai Wan () Kau Sai Chau, Sai Kung #Whiskey () Kau Sai Chau, Sai Kung #Campers' Bay () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Pak Shui Wun () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Bayside () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Little Palm () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Lung Ha Wan () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Ung Kong Wan () Bluff Island, Clearwater Bay #Lung Kwu Upper () Lung Kwu Tan, west Tuen Mun #Lung Kwu Lower () Lung Kwu Tan, Tuen Mun #Dragon Bay () Tsing Lung Tau, Tsuen Wan #To Tei Wan () Shek O, Cape D'Aguilar #Tai Pak Wan () Discovery Bay, East Lantau Island #Tai Long Wan () Chi Ma Wan, South Lantau Island #Yi Long Wan () Chi Ma Wan, South Lantau Island #Sha Lo Wan () West Tung Chung, North Lantau Island #Tai Long Wan () Shek Pik, South Lantau Island #Lo Kei Wan () Shui Hau, South Lantau Island #Kau Ling Chung () Fan Lau, Southwest Lantau Island #Fan Lau Tung Wan () Fan Lau, Southwest Lantau Island #Fan Lan Sai Wan () Fan Lau,Jules Brown and Dinah Gardner, Hong Kong and Macau, page 187 Southwest Lantau Island #Luk Keng Wan () Yam O, Northeast Lantau Island #Tai Kwai Wan () Northwest Cheung Chau #Po Yue Wan () Southwest Cheung Chau #Pak Tso Wan () Southwest Cheung Chau #Shek Pai Wan () Southeast Lamma Island #Mo Tat wan () East Lamma Island #Kwo Chau Wan () Tai Chau, Ninepin Group #Siu A Chau Wan () Siu A Chau, Soko Islands  Water quality grading system  Gazetted beaches in Hong Kong are classified into four grades ( Grades 1 ‚Äì 4 ) according to the level of E. coli in the water of the beaches. This is done by the Environmental Protection Department. Every week, water samples of each beach are collected for analysis to find out their bacterial level. Grade 1 means that the water qualities of the beaches are good. The amount of E. coli is no more than 24 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also no related case of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses has been reported by swimmers who have swum at these beaches. Grade 2 means that the water qualities of the beaches are fair. The amount of E. coli is about 25 ‚Äì 180 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is no more than 10 cases per 1000 swimmers. Grade 3 means that the water qualities of the beaches are poor. The amount of E. coli is about 181 ‚Äì 610 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is about 11 ‚Äì 15 cases per 1000 swimmers. Grade 4 means that the water quality is very poor. The amount of E. coli is greater than 610 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is greater than 15 cases per 1000 swimmers. As a result, swimmers are advised not to swim at Grade 4 beaches.

She was born and grew up in Somerset, and spent half of her childhood in Glastonbury, and the other half in a small farming village on the edge of the Somerset Levels. She had a mixed education, and ended up attending art college for a year before moving to London. A first career culminated in working as a Production Assistant then Producer in TV commercials for directors including Ridley and Tony Scott. She gave it up to spend a year in Spain with her boyfriend Dominic, who remains her partner. She returned pregnant. She attended the University of Southampton as a mature student. Only after the birth of her second son in 1995 she started to write seriously. Having taught adult students wanting to return to education when her children where young, she later decided to use her teaching skills to work with marginalised communities, including recovering addicts, mental health service users, gypsies and, in Labrador, aboriginal peoples. She taught and mentored creative writing and performance, focusing on developing skills and self-esteem, and, always, the writer's own original voice. In 2018 she founded The Outsiders Project a company giving voice to the unheard. She spent 3 years on the Management Committee for the Society of Authors, and is on the Advisory Board of the Alpine Fellowship. In 2018 she became a trustee of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, and is now Deputy Chair underneath Margaret Caseley-Hayford.  Literary Work  = Prose = In May 2004, her first novel, Black Dirt, was published by Picador and was long-listed for the Orange Prize and runner up for the Commonwealth Prize. in May 2012, her third novel, The Colour of Milk, was published by Penguin. It was translated to multiple languages, winning the Prix Interalli√© in France where it was also shortlisted for the Prix Femina, and voted the book of the year in Spain. In 2015 her most recent novel, Memoirs of a Dipper, was published. = Radio Dramas = Her first radio play, Milk, won the Richard Imison Award.

In 2010 her play Bedlam was the first written by a woman to be performed at Shakespeare's Globe. She has also written plays for young people for National Theatre Connections, The Beauty Manifesto and Terra which was a dance theatre piece with choreography by Anthony Missem. She also wrote for Royal Theatre Plymouth and the play, The Word, for RADA Elders group. = Other Projects = In 2014 Leyshon wrote her first libretto, The River Keeper, for Streetwise Opera, a charity which works with homeless people. In 2018 she performed her one-woman show, Three Letters, at the Royal Shakespeare Company, then at Edinburgh Fringe where it was broadcast on BBC Radio 3.  The Outsiders Project  In 2018 Leyshon founded The Outsiders Project, a company that gives voice to the unheard and marginalised through working with outsider artists and supporting their creativity. They work with members of the community of Boscombe, and the work is shown locally then shared with a wider world. The work is designed to develop authentic voices and is of exceptional quality. Their vision is to show that people sidelined from society can write, perform and create work at the highest level. They support the outsider community to push boundaries to prove they can create work of outstanding quality and worth. The Outsiders Project has produced three works for the stage; Vodka Hunters, Secret Voices and The Truth About Men, all three as part of BEAF ‚Äì Bournemouth Emerging Arts Fringe Festival 2018 and 2019. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic they launched the Tattoo Project an online initiative to gather, tell stories and find new outsider artists.  Teaching  Leyshon has been teaching for 27 years, but spent the last 17 years specialising in outsider voices. She has worked extensively with the recovery community in prisons and mental health settings. She has also worked with the Gypsy community, and has led many partnership courses for Arvon Foundation.

It has an area of 5,442 dunams () of land under its jurisdiction. In its population was . History French scholar Victor Gu√©rin associated Sha'ab with Saab, a place mentioned by 1st- century writer Josephus.Josephus, III, ¬ß 21, cited in Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 434-435, cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275TIR, p. 218, cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275 The Midrash Rabba (Leviticus Rabba s. 20) mentions a certain Rabbi Mani of Sha'ab. In the 14th century, the tax income from the village was given to the wakf of the madrasah and mausoleum of the Shafi'i Manjaq in Egypt.MPF, 71, No. 53. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275 =Ottoman era= In 1517, Sha'ab was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire along with the rest of Palestine. In 1573 (981 AH) Sha'ab was one of several villages in Galilee which rebelled against the Ottomans.Heyd, 1960, p. 84-85. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275 In 1596, the village appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Acre, part of Safad Sanjak, with a population of 102 households and 37 bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, \\"goats and bees\\", in addition to \\"occasional revenues\\"; a total of 14,354 ak√ße. 3/4 of the revenue went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 193Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. According to local tradition, the village started to flourish under anti- Ottoman rebel Zahir al-Umar (ca. 1768).Petersen, 2001, p. 275 In 1859, the population was estimated to be 1,500. Some were Catholic, the majority Muslim. The cultivated fields were estimated to be 80 feddans.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 271 Gu√©rin visited in the 1870s, and wrote that the village of Sh'aib consisted of four quarters. The inhabitants, he wrote, were for the most part Muslim, about 800, and some 20 \\"Schismatic Greek\\" families. The Muslims had two Mosques and two walis.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 434-435Conder & Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 339 In 1881, Sha'ab was described as being in a valley with fine olive groves, while part of the hill behind it was cultivated in corn. A population list from about 1887 showed that Sha'ab had about 1,430 inhabitants; 1,345 Muslims and 85 Greek Catholics.Schumacher, 1888, p. 175 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sha'ab had a population of 1,206; 1,166 Muslims and 40 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 37 where the Christians were 15 Orthodox and 25 Melkites.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p.50 The population increased slightly in the 1931 census to 1,297; 1,277 Muslims, 19 Christians and 1 Jew, in a total of 284 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 102 British forces during the 1936‚Äì1939 revolt, 1936 During the 1936 revolt in Palestine, the British Army attacked Sha'ab, demolishing 190 houses in the village. According to an eyewitness account, the British collectively punished the village for harboring a rebel who allegedly set off a roadside explosive that killed four British soldiers and injured three. A day prior to the demolition of the homes, the army rounded up around 200 of its adult male residents and led them to a valley outside the village. As they were being lined up, a rebel fighter positioned on a nearby hill began yelling and firing into the air, confusing the soldiers and causing Sha'ab's detained men to disperse chaotically. One resident named Hassan Hajj Khatib was killed.Ghandour, 2009, p. 12. In the 1945 statistics, Sha'ab had 1,740 inhabitants; 30 Christians and 1,710 Muslims.Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 4 They owned a total of 17,870 dunams of land, while 121 dunams were public.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 131 =State of Israel= Sha'ab was captured by the Israel Forces (IDF) on 19 July 1948 during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The villagers surrendered without a fight,Morris 2004, p. 423 and their village was subsequently depopulated in the Palestinian exodus. Still, Sha'ab was found by the IDF's Ninth Brigade still to be inhabited in December 1948, and the residents were expelled on foot.Morris 2004, p. 514 The village was the headquarters and hometown of Abu Is'af, leader of one of the most effective local militias during the war and someone viewed as a hero by many Arabs in the area.Cohen, 2010, p. 100. Most of Sha'ab's original residents became internally displaced refugees, settling in nearby Arab villages, predominantly in Majd al-Krum and Sakhnin. Meanwhile, many refugees from the depopulated villages of al-Birwa, al-Damun and Mi'ar were settled in Sha'ab in 1948 and were joined by refugees from Kirad al-Ghannam and Kirad al-Baqqara in the Hula Valley in 1953. The original residents of Sha'ab protested their circumstances and launched a campaign soon after the end of the war to return to their homes.Cohen, 2010, p. 101 They gained the sympathy of most of the refugees from the Hula Valley and al-Birwa, but faced resistance from the former residents of al-Damun and Mi'ar. By 1950, roughly 10% of Sha'ab's original inhabitants returned to the village and eventually many more were given permission to resettle.Cohen, 2010, pp. 102-103 Notable buildings =Mosque of Zahir al-Umar= The mosque of Zahir al-Umar is situated in the centre of the old village. In 1933 it was inspected by Na'im Makhouly from the Palestine Antiquities Museum, who found that the mosque dated from the time of Zahir al-Umar. In 1933 the mosque was in disrepair. Pictures from the time show two arcades: one had four arches connected with the side wall, with two columns in the centre. A reused Ionic capital could be seen, and above the doorway was a reused Roman lintel (first noticed by Gu√©rin in the 1870s).Petersen, 2001, p. 276 Andrew Petersen, an archaeologist specialising in Islamic architecture, surveyed the mosque in 1994. He found that the present mosque, built in the 1980s, encased the old building. The old part is the prayer hall, has an entrance to the north. This hall is square, covered with a dome. The dome rests on large squinches, which are supported by corbels. According to Petersen, the domed prayer hall is consistent with an 18th-century construction date. =Tomb of Shaykh Alami= The Maqam Shaykh Alami is situated south of the mosque, within its enclosure. It is built at a slope, where the ground rises to the south. On the east side there are two entrances; to the maqam, and to an underground cistern. The building is rectangular, 10 x 20 m, with an interior divided into two. The southern part contains a mihrab and is covered with a barrel vault. The northern end is covered with a dome, and has two large cenotaphs. According to Petersen, the buildings appear medieval.

He was one of Britain's most famous steam locomotive engineers, who rose to become Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). He was the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives in Britain, including the LNER Class A1 and LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific engines. An A1 Pacific, Flying Scotsman, was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service, and an A4, number 4468 Mallard, still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world (126 mph). Gresley's engines were considered elegant, both aesthetically and mechanically. His invention of a three-cylinder design with only two sets of Walschaerts valve gear, the Gresley conjugated valve gear, produced smooth running and power at lower cost than would have been achieved with a more conventional three sets of Walschaerts gear.

After several minor appointments with the L&YR; he was made Outdoor Assistant in the Carriage and Wagon Department in 1901; in 1902 he was appointed Assistant Works Manager at Newton Heath depot, and Works Manager the following year. This rapid rise in his career was maintained, for he became Assistant Superintendent of the Carriage and Wagon Department of the L&YR; in 1904. A year later, he moved to the Great Northern Railway (GNR) as Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. He succeeded Henry A. Ivatt as CME of the GNR on 1 October 1911. At the 1923 Grouping, he was appointed CME of the newly formed LNER (the post had originally been offered to the ageing John G. Robinson; Robinson declined and suggested the much younger Gresley). In 1936, Gresley was awarded an honorary DSc by Manchester University and a knighthood by King Edward VIII; also in that year he presided over the IMechE. During the 1930s, Sir Nigel Gresley lived at Salisbury Hall, near St. Albans in Hertfordshire. Gresley developed an interest in breeding wild birds and ducks in the moat; intriguingly, among the species were Mallard ducks.Don Hale, Mallard, Aurum Press, 2005, pages 51‚Äì52 The Hall still exists today as a private residence and is adjacent to the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre, with its links to the design of the famous Mosquito aircraft during World War II. In 1936, Gresley designed the 1,500 V DC locomotives for the proposed electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield. The Second World War forced the postponement of the project, which was completed in the early 1950s. Gresley was appointed CBE in 1920 and was knighted in the 1936 Birthday Honours. Gresley died on 5 April 1941, after a short illness, and was buried in St Peter's Church, Netherseal, Derbyshire. He was succeeded as the LNER CME by Edward Thompson. Memorials A memorial plaque to Gresley's achievements was unveiled at Edinburgh Waverley railway station in 2001. It was created by the Gresley Society and incorporates line drawings of his Flying Scotsman and Mallard locomotives. Following the redevelopment of the site previously home to Doncaster College, the square outside the new Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council Offices and Cast Theatre was named Sir Nigel Gresley Square, in honour of the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives built at Doncaster Plant Works following a public poll of Doncaster residents hosted by the Doncaster Free Press. Sir Nigel Gresley Square was opened to the public as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, by the Mayor of Doncaster Mr. Peter Davies and two of Nigel Gresley's grandsons, in May 2012. LNER Class A4 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley is named after its designer. A statue of Gresley was unveiled at King's Cross station in London on 5 April 2016, the 75th anniversary of his death. Sculptor Hazel Reeves originally included a duck alongside Gresley in reference to his hobby of breeding water fowl and his bird-themed locomotive names such as Mallard, but this was removed from the final design when two of Gresley's grandsons complained it was \\"demeaning\\".

It was depopulated in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. History Known in Crusader times as Deirelcobebe, the ruins of the ancient Canaanite city of Lachish lay adjacent to the village,Dauphin, 1998, p. 880 which was subject to extensive archaeological excavations by the British Mandatory authorities in Palestine, and by Israeli authorities subsequent to its capture during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. =Ottoman period= In 1517, Al-Qubayba was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Gaza under the liwa' (district) of Gaza. It had a population of 33 Muslim household, an estimated 182 persons. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, sesame, and fruit trees, as well as goats and beehives; a total of 4,600 ak√ße. 11/24 of the revenue went to a Waqf. In 1838 Edward Robinson noted 200 reapers and gleaners at work in a field near Al- Qubayba (which he called Kubeibeh). He added: \\"Some were taking their refreshment, and offered us some of their \\"parched corn.\\" In the season of harvest, the grains of wheat, not yet fully dry and hard, are roasted in a pan or an iron plate, and constitute a very palliative article of bread; this is eaten along with bread, or instead of it.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 394 Robinson further noted Kubeibeh as a Muslim village, in the Gaza district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 119 In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Al-Qubayba as a large village built of adobe brick, situated on rolling hills near a plain, surrounded by a barren and stony area.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 258 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Al-Qubaiba had a population of 646, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Hebron, p. 10 increasing in the 1931 census to 800, still all Muslim, in a total of 141 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 33 The village had a school, a mosque, and a number of small shops. Two wells located northwest and southwest of it provided drinking water. el Qubeiba 1945 1:250,000 In the 1945 statistics the population of Al-Qubayba was 1,060, all Muslims, who owned 11,912 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 8109 dunams were for cerealsGovernment of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 93 while 35 dunams were built-up (urban) land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 143 el Qubeiba 1947 1:20,000 =1948 and aftermath= Al- Qubayba was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. The village was first attacked during Operation Barak. Though defended by Egyptian forces, al-Qubayba was taken by Israeli forces in the final stages of Operation Yoav on 28 October 1948. The population had fled and the village was destroyed. The area was subsequently incorporated into the State of Israel and in 1955 the moshav of Lakhish was established to the southwest of the village site on what had been village lands. Of the village mosque, an elementary school, and more than 141 houses that made up al- Qubayba, Walid Khalidi notes that all that remains to mark the site in contemporary times are cacti and a handful of olive trees. Culture and Village Life The inhabitants of the village mostly grew cereals; wheat and barley were grown by the well off, and corn by the rest. The village mostly bartered with surrounding villages such as Al-Dawayima and Beit Gibrin, most of the cereals harvest was used to sustain sheep herds, from where in most of the village income is derived. The Eponym, \\"Ibn 'Awwad\\", of the village was named after the clan residing therein. A woman's thob (loose fitting robe with sleeves), from Qubeiba dated to about 1910 forms part of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe. The dress is a collage of different fabrics, textures and colors. The front and the upper half of the back are of black cotton. The chest panel, the side panels and the lower back of the skirt are handwoven indigo linen. Colorful silk cross-stitch embroidery, in red, violet, orange, yellow, green and black, create an effect described as \\"particularly gay, twinkling\\" The qabbeh (square chest panel) is embroidered with the qurunful (\\"clove\\") motif, and it has vertical rows of eight-pointed stars, called qamr (\\"moons\\"), and a row of the mushut (\\"combs\\") pattern. There are eight embroidered columns on each side panel of the dress. The patterns which are used are fanajin qahweh (\\"coffee cups\\"), khem-el-basha (\\"the pashas tent\\"), irq el-ward (\\"rose branch\\"), and miftah Khalil (\\"key of Hebron\\"). There is also a pattern (with flowers, moons, trees, tents and tiles) not seen anywhere else in the MOMA collection. Finally, there is also some embroidery at the wrists.

According to a 1945 census, the town's population was 3,710, and the village lands comprised a total land area of 60,585 dunums of which nearly half was cultivable. The population figures for this town also included the populations of nearby khirbets, or ancient villages. During the 1948 Palestine war, the al-Dawayima massacre occurred. According to Saleh Abd al-Jawad an estimated 80‚Äì200 civilian men, women and children were killed.Saleh Abdel Jawad (2007), Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War, in Benvenisti & al, 2007, pp. 59‚Äì127 See p. 67 According to John Bagot Glubb, a UN report said that 30 women and children were killed.Glubb, 1957, pp. 211-212 History It has been occasionally identified with the Old Testament town of Bosqat, the home of Josiah's mother Jedidah (2 Kings, 22:1) though the association has not found widespread acceptance.Jennifer L. Groves, 'Boskath', in David Noel Freedman, (ed.) Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, Wm B.Eerdsmans/Amsterdam University Press 2000 p.198. Al-Dawayima's historical remains encompass a long period from the Bronze Age, through to the Persian and Hellenistic, down to the Ottoman period. Bulldozing what remains of the Palestinian village to prepare a new Israeli village has revealed an ancient olive press, a columbarium cave, a villa from the Second Temple era, and both mikvehs and cisterns. The \\"core clan\\" of Al-Dawayima were the Ahdibs, who traced their origin to the Muslim conquest and settlement of Palestine in the seventh century.Morris, 2004, p. 469 =Ottoman era= In the late Ottoman era, in May, 1838, Edward Robinson visited during harvesting time. He noted that Al-Dawayima was situated on a hill, with a view of several villages to the east. During the harvest, several Christians from Beit Jala were employed here as labourers; the barley harvest was coming to an end, while the wheat harvest was just beginning.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, pp. 400-402 He further noted it as a Muslim village, between the mountains and Gaza, but subject to the government of el- Khulil.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 117 In 1863 Victor Gu√©rin visited twice, and he estimated that the village contained 900 inhabitants,Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 342-3, 361 while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 found that Dawaime had only a population of 85, in a total of 34 houses, though the population count included men, only. It also noted that it was located west of Hebron.Socin, 1879, p. 151Hartmann, 1883, p. 144 found 100 houses, way more than Socin In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described al-Dawayima as a village on a high stony ridge that had olive groves beneath it. On a higher ridge to the west stood a shrine that was topped by a white stone.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p.258. Also quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 213.

They maintained several religious shrines, chief among them the shrine of Shaykh ¬¥Ali. This shrine had a large courtyard, a number of rooms, and one large hall for prayers, and was surrounded by fig and carob trees and cactuses. It attracted visitors from the neighboring villages.Hudayb, 1985, p. 54. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 213 A mosque was located in the village center, it was maintained by the followers of al-tariqa al-khalwatiyya, a Sufi mystic order founded by Shaykh Umar al-Khalwati (d.1397)Glass√©, 1989, p. 221. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 213 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, AI Dawaima had a population of 2,441 inhabitants, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub- district of Hebron, p. 10 increasing in the 1931 census to 2,688, still all Muslim, in a total of 559 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 28 The villagers expanded and renovated the village mosque in the 1930s, and added a tall minaret. In the 1945 statistics, Al-Dawayima had a population of 3,710 Muslims, with a total land area of 60.585 dunums of land. By 1944/45, 21,191 dunums of village land were allotted to cereals, 1,206 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 93 while 179 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 143 =1948 War and aftermath= Al-Dawaymima was captured by Israel's Eighty Ninth Battalion (commanded by Dov Chesis) of the 8th Armored Brigade led by the founder of the Palmach, Yitzhak Sadeh, after Operation Yoav on 29 October 1948, five days after the start of the truce. It was the site of the al-Dawayima massacre in which 80‚Äì200 civilians were killed, including women and children. According to Lieutenant-General John Bagot Glubb, a British officer stationed with Jordanian's Arab Legion in Bethlehem and Hebron at that time, the massacre was calculated to drive out the villagers and had been reported by UN observers to involve 30 deaths.Glubb, 1957, pp. 211-212. \\"The Israelis were now deliberately driving out all Arabs, a process assisted now and then but the usual 'calculated massacre'. On October 31st, United Nations observers reported that the Israelis had killed thirty women and children at Dawaima (Dawayima), west of Hebron. It would be an exaggeration to claim that great numbers were massacred. But just enough were killed, or roughly handled, to make sure that all the civilian population took flight, thereby leaving more and more land vacant for future Jewish settlement. These particular villages west of Hebron were to remain vacant and their lands uncultivated for eight years.\\" The massacre was cited by Yigal Allon as the reason for the halting of the creeping annexation that included Bayt Jibrin, Qubeiba and Tel Maresha.Shapira, 2008, p. 248 It was also seen as a reprisal by the Israelis for the massacre of Jews in Kfar Etzion months before, on May 13, 1948, by Palestinian fighters and some members of the Arab Legion.Morris, 2004, p. 469 and Morris, 2008, p. 333. The moshav of Amatzia was established in 1955 on land that had belonged to Al-Dawayima.Khalidi, 1992, p.215 According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi : > \\"The site has been fenced in. A cowshed, a chicken coop, and granaries have > been built at its center (which has been leveled). The southern side of the > site contains stone terraces and the remnants of a house. The eastern side > is occupied by the residential area of the moshav.\\" In 2013, the whole area, apart from some ancient Jewish remains, was bulldozed to pave the way for the erection of a new community, to be named Karmei Katif, which is planned to house evacuees of the Gaza Strip settlements. The new name is reminiscent of Gush Katif. Culture A woman's thob (loose fitting robe with sleeves) dated to about 1910 that was produced in Al-Dawayima is part of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe. The dress is of hand-woven blue indigo linen. The embroidery is in predominantly red silk cross-stitch, with touches of violet, orange, yellow, white, green and black. The upper half of the qabbeh (the square chest panel) is embroidered with alternating columns of diamonds, (a pattern known as el-ferraneh), and eight-pointed stars, (called qamr (\\"moons\\")). The lower half of the qabbeh is in the qelayed (\\"necklaces\\") pattern. The side-panels of the skirt are completely covered with embroidered columns. Among the patterns used here are: nakhleh (\\"palm\\") motif, ward-wil-aleq (\\"rose-and-leech\\") and khem-el-basha (\\"the pashas tent\\"). Each column is topped with various trees. There is no embroidery on the long, pointed sleeves.Stillman, 1979, pp. 56-57 The village is often featured in the works of Palestinian artist Abdul Hay Mosallam who was expelled from it in 1948. By 2011, two books about the village history had been published.Davis, 2011, pp. 30 -31 =In popular culture= *In the 2008 film Salt of this Sea, Al-Dawayima is the village which Emad, the male protagonist, hails from. The village ruins serve as the temporary residence of the main characters, Emad and Soraya. The film is dedicated to the memory of the Al-Dawayima massacre.

It was captured by Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, during which all of its inhabitants fled or were expelled. Agur, Tzafririm, Givat Yeshayahu, Li-On, and Tirosh were built on the village lands.  History  Near 'Ajjur, at Khirbet Jannaba al-Fauqa, was a probable site of the Battle of Ajnadayn, waged in the 7th-century CE between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire, and which resulted in a decisive Rashidun victory, incorporating most of Palestine into the domains of Islam. The village of 'Ajjur itself was built during early Fatimid rule in the region in the early twelfth century CE. A mosque was built during this period, and continued to serve 'Ajjur's community until its demise.Khalidi, 1992, p. 206 The village 'Ajjur is believed to be named after \\"a sort of cucumber.\\"p. 145 in: =Ottoman era= Arab chronicler Mujir ad-Din reported that he passed through 'Ajjur on his way from Gaza to Jerusalem in the early sixteenth century, when the village was a part of the Ottoman Empire.al-'Ulaymi, 1876, p. 230.

Gu√©rin further noted that several houses, including that of the local Sheikh, were built partly with ancient stones.Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 103 Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that 'Ajjur had 86 houses and a population of 254, though the population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 142 Hartmann found that 'Ajjur had 120 houses.Hartmann, 1883, p. 143 In the 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described 'Ajjur as a small village containing olive trees,Conder and Kitchener, 1882, p. 414. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 207 with most of its houses clustered together, but some dispersed to the west and south. A private school named Abu Hasan was established in this time period.Khalidi, 1992, p. 207 In 1896 the population of 'Ajjur was estimated to be about 1,767 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 123 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, 'Ajjur had a population of 2,073 inhabitants, all Muslim,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub- district of Hebron, p. 10 increasing in the 1931 census to 2,917; 4 Christians and the rest Muslims, in a total of 566 residential houses.Mills, 1932, p. 27 During this period, 'Ajjur became economically active in its vicinity. It held a Friday market or souk that attracted consumers and merchants from nearby towns and villages. A second school was founded in the village in 1934, which served students from nearby villages as well as from 'Ajjur. Like other Arab villages in Palestine at the time, 'Ajjur depended on agriculture, which was the basis of its economy. The main crops were olives and wheat. The second most important economic activity was animal husbandry, in particular, goat herding. Animal ownership was a symbol of social status and pride in the village, and residents gave affectionate names to certain types of animals. Animal herding caused seasonal movement by herders to distant dwellings from the village site, but still in its vicinity such as, Khirbet al-Sura and Khirbet al-'Ammuriyya. Shoe making, carpentry, and tanning were other common occupations in 'Ajjur. In the 1945 statistics, 'Ajjur had a population of 3,730; 10 Christians and 3,720 Muslims, with a total of 58,074 dunams of land. Of this, 2,428 dunums were irrigated or used for plantations, 25,227 dunams used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

Most of 'Ajjur's inhabitants had fled prior to this assault‚Äîtheir flight was triggered by an earlier attack, on 23 July-24. In 1992, the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village: \\"Only three houses remain; two are deserted and one has been turned into a warehouse. One of the deserted houses is a two-storey stone structure that has a large, triple-arched front porch.\\" Petersen, who inspected the place in 1994, noted \\"a large two-storey building with a vaulted arcade on the northern side. The upper part of the building is today used as a house whilst the lower part appears to be abandoned (although it remains locked). The arcade consists of three cross-vaulted bays resting on two free- standing piers and two engaged piers at either end. On the outer (north) face of each of the two central piers there is a stone carved with two rosettes which appears to be part of a classical entablature. The outer arches is emphasised by a flat hood moulding. Each bay is covered with a cross-vault which reaches a height of approximately 4m. [..] The upper floor is reached by an external staircase on the east side leading to a walled terrace above the arcade.

In geometry, Thales's theorem states that if A, B, and C are distinct points on a circle where the line is a diameter, the angle ABC is a right angle. Thales's theorem is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem and is mentioned and proved as part of the 31st proposition in the third book of Euclid's Elements. It is generally attributed to Thales of Miletus, who is said to have offered an ox, probably to the god Apollo, as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the discovery, but it is sometimes attributed to Pythagoras. History There is nothing extant of the writing of Thales; work done in ancient Greece tended to be attributed to men of wisdom without respect to all the individuals involved in any particular intellectual constructions ‚Äî this is true of Pythagoras especially. Attribution did tend to occur at a later time. Reference to Thales was made by Proclus, and by Diogenes La√´rtius documenting Pamphila's statement that Thales \\"was the first to inscribe in a circle a right-angle triangle\\". Indian and Babylonian mathematicians knew this for special cases before Thales proved it.de Laet, Siegfried J. (1996). History of Humanity: Scientific and Cultural Development. UNESCO, Volume 3, p. 14. It is believed that Thales learned that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle during his travels to Babylon.Boyer, Carl B. and Merzbach, Uta C. (2010). A History of Mathematics. John Wiley and Sons, Chapter IV. The theorem is named after Thales because he was said by ancient sources to have been the first to prove the theorem, using his own results that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, and that the sum of angles in a triangle is equal to 180¬∞. Dante's Paradiso (canto 13, lines 101‚Äì102) refers to Thales's theorem in the course of a speech.  Proof  =First proof= The following facts are used: the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180¬∞ and the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal. Since = = , ‚àÜOBA and ‚àÜOBC are isosceles triangles, and by the equality of the base angles of an isosceles triangle, ‚à†OBC = ‚à†OCB and ‚à†OBA = ‚à†OAB. Let Œ± = ‚à†BAO and Œ≤ = ‚à†OBC. The three internal angles of the ‚àÜABC triangle are Œ±, (Œ± + Œ≤), and Œ≤. Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to 180¬∞, we have :\\\\alpha+\\\\left( \\\\alpha + \\\\beta \\\\right) + \\\\beta = 180^\\\\circ :2\\\\alpha + 2\\\\beta =180^\\\\circ :2( \\\\alpha + \\\\beta ) =180^\\\\circ :\\\\therefore \\\\alpha + \\\\beta =90^\\\\circ. Q.E.D. =Second proof= The theorem may also be proven using trigonometry: Let O = (0, 0), A = (-1, 0), and C = (1, 0). Then B is a point on the unit circle (\\\\cos \\\\theta, \\\\sin \\\\theta). We will show that ‚àÜABC forms a right angle by proving that and are perpendicular ‚Äî that is, the product of their slopes is equal to ‚àí1. We calculate the slopes for and : :m_{AB} = \\\\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\theta}{\\\\cos \\\\theta + 1} and :m_{BC} = \\\\frac{y_B - y_C}{x_B - x_C} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\theta}{\\\\cos \\\\theta - 1} Then we show that their product equals ‚àí1: : \\\\begin{align} &m;_{AB} \\\\cdot m_{BC}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\theta}{\\\\cos \\\\theta + 1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\theta}{\\\\cos \\\\theta - 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\frac{\\\\sin ^2 \\\\theta}{\\\\cos ^2 \\\\theta -1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\frac{\\\\sin ^2 \\\\theta}{-\\\\sin ^2 \\\\theta}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] = {} & {-1} \\\\end{align} Note the use of the Pythagorean trigonometric identity \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta + \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta = 1. =Third proof= Thales's theorem and reflections Let ABC be a triangle in a circle where AB is a diameter in that circle. Then construct a new triangle ABD by mirroring triangle ABC over the line AB and then mirroring it again over the line perpendicular to AB which goes through the center of the circle. Since lines AC and BD are parallel, likewise for AD and CB, the quadrilateral ACBD is a parallelogram. Since lines AB and CD are both diameters of the circle and therefore are equal length, the parallelogram must be a rectangle. All angles in a rectangle are right angles. Converse For any triangle, and, in particular, any right triangle, there is exactly one circle containing all three vertices of the triangle. (Sketch of proof. The locus of points equidistant from two given points is a straight line that is called the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the points. The perpendicular bisectors of any two sides of a triangle intersect in exactly one point. This point must be equidistant from the vertices of the triangle.) This circle is called the circumcircle of the triangle. One way of formulating Thales's theorem is: if the center of a triangle's circumcircle lies on the triangle then the triangle is right, and the center of its circumcircle lies on its hypotenuse. The converse of Thales's theorem is then: the center of the circumcircle of a right triangle lies on its hypotenuse. (Equivalently, a right triangle's hypotenuse is a diameter of its circumcircle.) =Proof of the converse using geometry= Figure for the proof of the converse This proof consists of 'completing' the right triangle to form a rectangle and noticing that the center of that rectangle is equidistant from the vertices and so is the center of the circumscribing circle of the original triangle, it utilizes two facts: *adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (add to 180¬∞) and, *the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and cross each other in their median point. Let there be a right angle ‚à†ABC, r a line parallel to passing by A and s a line parallel to passing by C. Let D be the point of intersection of lines r and s (Note that it has not been proven that D lies on the circle) The quadrilateral ABCD forms a parallelogram by construction (as opposite sides are parallel). Since in a parallelogram adjacent angles are supplementary (add to 180¬∞) and ‚à†ABC is a right angle (90¬∞) then angles ‚à†BAD, ‚à†BCD, and ‚à†ADC are also right (90¬∞); consequently ABCD is a rectangle. Let O be the point of intersection of the diagonals and . Then the point O, by the second fact above, is equidistant from A, B, and C. And so O is center of the circumscribing circle, and the hypotenuse of the triangle () is a diameter of the circle. =Alternate proof of the converse using geometry= Given a right triangle with hypotenuse , construct a circle Œ© whose diameter is . Let be the center of Œ©. Let be the intersection of Œ© and the ray . By Thales's theorem, ‚à† is right. But then must equal . (If lies inside ‚àÜ, ‚à† would be obtuse, and if lies outside ‚àÜ, ‚à† would be acute.) =Proof of the converse using linear algebra= This proof utilizes two facts: *two lines form a right angle if and only if the dot product of their directional vectors is zero, and *the square of the length of a vector is given by the dot product of the vector with itself. Let there be a right angle ‚à†ABC and circle M with as a diameter. Let M's center lie on the origin, for easier calculation. Then we know *A = ‚àí C, because the circle centered at the origin has as diameter, and *(A ‚àí B) ¬∑ (B ‚àí C) = 0, because ‚à†ABC is a right angle. It follows :0 = (A ‚àí B) ¬∑ (B ‚àí C) = (A ‚àí B) ¬∑ (B + A) = A2 ‚àí B2. Hence: :A = B. This means that A and B are equidistant from the origin, i.e. from the center of M. Since A lies on M, so does B, and the circle M is therefore the triangle's circumcircle. The above calculations in fact establish that both directions of Thales's theorem are valid in any inner product space. Generalizations and related results Thales's theorem is a special case of the following theorem: :Given three points A, B and C on a circle with center O, the angle ‚à†AOC is twice as large as the angle ‚à†ABC. See inscribed angle, the proof of this theorem is quite similar to the proof of Thales's theorem given above. A related result to Thales's theorem is the following: *If is a diameter of a circle, then: :*If B is inside the circle, then ‚à†ABC > 90¬∞ :*If B is on the circle, then ‚à†ABC = 90¬∞ :*If B is outside the circle, then ‚à†ABC < 90¬∞. Application Constructing a tangent using Thales's theorem. Thales's theorem can be used to construct the tangent to a given circle that passes through a given point. In the figure at right, given circle k with centre O and the point P outside k, bisect OP at H and draw the circle of radius OH with centre H. OP is a diameter of this circle, so the triangles connecting OP to the points T and T‚Ä≤ where the circles intersect are both right triangles. Geometric method to find ‚àöp using the geometric mean theorem with Thales's theorem can also be used to find the centre of a circle using an object with a right angle, such as a set square or rectangular sheet of paper larger than the circle.Resources for Teaching Mathematics: 14‚Äì16 Colin Foster The angle is placed anywhere on its circumference (figure 1). The intersections of the two sides with the circumference define a diameter (figure 2). Repeating this with a different set of intersections yields another diameter (figure 3). The centre is at the intersection of the diameters.

It was a Jewish settlement between 70 and 425 CE.Grootkerk, 2000, p. 3 Blown glass pitchers uncovered in a tomb in al-Bassa were dated to circa 396 CE.Whitehouse and Corning Museum of Glass, 2002, p. 182 An ancient Christian burial place and 18 other archaeological sites were located in the village. = Middle Ages = El Khouri mansion, 2008 The Survey of Western Palestine, sponsored by the Palestine Exploration Fund, identified al-Bassa as, \\"probably a Crusading village\\"; however, archaeological excavations uncovered evidence of an ecclesiastical farm in operation there between the 5th to 8th centuries, and pottery sherds indicate continuous inhabitation throughout the Middle Ages. The site was used in 1189 C.E. as a Crusader encampment during a military campaign,Abu Shama, RHC Or, IV, p. 406. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 111 and a document dated October 1200 recorded the sale of the village by King Amalric II of Jerusalem to the Teutonic Order.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 30-31, No.38. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 111 and in Ellenblum, 2003, pp. 59, 146 No Crusader era buildings have been found in al-Bassa, and a cross once dated to the Crusader period was later re-dated to the Byzantine era. A-Bassa was the first village listed as part of the domain of the Crusaders during the hudna between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur (Qalawun) in 1283. = Ottoman Empire = In 1596, al-Bassa was part of the Ottoman Empire, a village in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the Safad Sanjak, with a population of 76 Muslim families and 28 Muslim bachelors. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat olives, barley, cotton and fruits, as well as on goats, beehives and pasture land; a total of 7,000 Ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 181. In the 18th century, al-Bassa became a zone of contention between Zahir al-Umar and the chiefs of Jabal Amil under Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar, while under his successor, Jezzar Pasha, al-Bassa was made the administrative center of the nahiya in around 1770.Cohen, 1973, p 124. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p.6 In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte described al-Bassa as a village of 600 Metawalis.Correspondance in√©dite officielle et confidentielle de Napol√©on Bonaparte (Paris, 1819), vol. 4, p. 291 A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon's invasion of that year showed the place, named as El Basa.Karmon, 1960, p. 160. The European explorer Van de Velde visited \\"el- Bussa\\" in 1851, and stayed with the sheikh, Aisel Yusuf, writing that \\"The clean house of Sheck Yusuf is a welcome sight, and the verdant meadows around the village are truly refreshing to the eye\\".Van de Velde, 1854, vol 1, p. 252 He further noted that \\"The inhabitants of Bussah are almost all members of the Greek Church. A few Musselmans live among them, and a few fellahs of a Bedouin tribe which wanders about in the neighborhood are frequently seen in the street.\\"Van de Velde, 1854, vol 1, p. 254 In 1863, the village was visited by Henry Baker Tristram who described it as a Christian village, where \\"olive oil, goats¬¥hair, and tobacco, seemed to be principal produce of the district; the latter being exported in some quantities, by way of Acre, to Egypt. Bee- keeping, also, is not an unimportant item of industry, and every house possesses a pile of bee-hives in its yard.\\" In the late 19th century, the village of Al-Bassa was described as being built of stone, situated on the edge of a plain, surrounded by large groves of olives and gardens of pomegranate, figs and apples. The village had about 1,050 residents.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, p. 145. Also quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 8 The village had a public elementary school for boys (built by the Ottomans in 1882), a private secondary school, and a public elementary school for girls.Hassoun, 2003, p. 26. A population list from about 1887 showed that el Basseh had 1,960 inhabitants; one third Muslim, and two thirds Greek Catholic Christians.Schumacher, 1888, p. 173 = British Mandate = The Franco-British boundary agreement of 1920 described an imprecisely defined boundary between Lebanon and Palestine. It appeared to pass close to the north of al-Bassa, leaving the village on the Palestinian side but cut off from much of its lands. However the French government included al-Bassa in a Lebanese census of 1921 and granted citizenship to its residents. Meanwhile, a joint British- French boundary commission was working to determine a precise border, making many adjustments in the process. By February 1922 it had determined a border that confirmed al-Bassa as being in Palestine. This became official in 1923. The citizenship of the residents was changed to Palestinian in 1926. In 1922, the people of al-Bassa founded a local council which was responsible for managing its local affairs. The British census of September 1922 listed a population of 867 Christians, 150 Metawalis and 1 Jew, though Kaufman reports that the Muslims were Sunni rather than Metawali.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Acre, p. 36 The Christians were listed as Greek Catholic (Melchite) (721), Orthodox (120), Church of England (17), Armenian Catholic (8), and one Roman Catholic. Its main economic activity was olive picking. At the 1931 census, which did not distinguish Metawalis from other Muslims, the village had 868 Muslims, 1076 Christians, and 4 Bahais.Mills, 1932, p. 99 The 1938 camp of Jewish labourers and Notrim (police) for construction of Tegart's wall was located adjacent to the village, and it ultimately became the site of a Tegart fort. By 1945 the village was home to a regional college. Important public structures at the time of its existence included two mosques, two churches, three schools and 18 other shrines both holy to Muslims and Christians. Al-Bassa was the only Palestinian village in the Galilee with a Christian high school.Mansour, 2004, p. 220. Some of Bassa's former public structures have been preserved and are found today within the Israeli localities of Shlomi and Betzet. 1938 massacre In 1938, during the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the village was the scene of a massacre committed by British soldiers. On September 6, 1938, four soldiers of the Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) were killed when their armoured car ran over a land mine near the village. In retaliation, British forces burnt the village down. After that, perhaps a few days later, about 50 Arabs from the village were collected by the RUR and some attached Royal Engineers. Some who tried to run away were shot. Then, according to British testimony, the remainder were put onto a bus which was forced to drive over a land mine laid by the soldiers, destroying the bus and killing many of the occupants. The village's inhabitants were then forced to dig a pit and throw all the bodies into it. Arab accounts added torture and other brutality. The total death toll was about 20. 1940s The church in al-Bassa in 2008 Al-Bassa was one of the largest, most developed villages in the north of the country, covering a land area of some 20,000 dunams of hills and plains, 2,000 of which were irrigated. A regional commercial center, it contained over sixty shops and eleven coffeehouses, a few of which sat along the Haifa-Beirut highway. The active village council had paved roads, installed a system of running water, and oversaw the convening of a wholesale produce market there every Sunday. An agricultural cooperative in the village counted over 150 members that promoted agricultural development, while also providing loans to local farmers. The population of about 4,000 was divided almost evenly between Muslims and Christians. Among the village institutions were a government run elementary school, a \\"National High School\\", a Greek Orthodox church, a Catholic church, and a mosque. The village was situated in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. In the 1945 statistics, the population had grown to 2,950; 1360 Muslims and 1590 Christians,Government of Palestine, Village Statistics, 1945 , p. 2 with of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, Arabs used 614 dunams for citrus and bananas, 14,699 dunams were plantations and irrigable land; 10,437 were used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 80 while 132 dunams were built-up (urban) land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 130 =Israel= Al-Bassa was captured by Yishuv's Haganah forces during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, in Operation Ben-Ami, on May 14, 1948. Al-Bassa's defenders were local militia men. Following its capture, the Haganah's Palmach forces concentrated the villagers in the local church where they shot and killed a number of youths before chasing the villagers out.Quigley, 2005, p. 62. One witness to the expulsion said that it was preceded by soldiers shooting and killing five villagers inside the church, while another said seven villagers were shot and killed by soldiers outside the church.Benvenisti, 2000, pp. 139 - 140. Al- Bassa was completely destroyed by the Israelis with the exception of a few houses, a church, and a Muslim shrine. At least 60 of the Christian villagers of Al-Bassa were taken by the Haganah to Mazra'a, where they remained for more than a year. Altogether 81 residents of al-Bassa became Israeli citizens as internally displaced Palestinians who lost their land rights and ended up in places like Nazareth.Areej Sabbagh-Khoury, The Internally displaced refugees.Masalha and Said, 2005, p. 217 The only day on which Palestinians did not require a permit to travel during that period was Israel's Independence Day. On this day, which Palestinians call Nakba Day, internally displaced Palestinians would visit their former villages. Wakim Wakim, an attorney from Al-Bassa and a leading member of the Association for the Defense of the Rights of the Internally Displaced explains: \\"The day when Israel celebrates is the day we mourn\\" (emphasis in original). Most of the former villagers of al-Bassa (circa 95%) were pushed north towards Lebanon, concentrating in the Dbayeh refugee camp near Jounieh east of Beirut. Prior to and during the Lebanese Civil War, this camp suffered severe damage in the fighting and was largely destroyed, though it still has a population of some 4,233 people who are mostly Palestinian Christian refugees. Other former residents of Al-Bassa and the refugee camp in Lebanon ended up in Lansing, Michigan where they established an international village club and hold annual gatherings attended by over 300 people. The village was inspected in 1992, when it was found that although most of the houses of Al-Bassa had been destroyed, a number of historic buildings survived, including two churches, a mosque, and a maqam.Petersen, 2001, p. https://www.academia.edu/21619490/Gazetteer_3._A-C 111 Landmarks According to Petersen, the mosque appears to be a relatively modern construct, probably built in the early 1900s. It consists of a tall square room with a flat roof supported by iron girders. There is a cylindrical minaret at the north-east corner. There are tall pointed windows on all four sides, and a mihrab in the middle of the south wall. At the time of the inspection, 1992, the building was used as a sheep pen. The maqam in 2008 The maqam is located about 20 meters east of the mosque. It consists of two parts: a walled courtyard, and a domed prayer room. In the courtyard there is a mihrab in the south wall, and a doorway in the east wall leads into the main prayer room. Pendentives springing from four thick piers support wide arches and the dome. In the middle of the south wall there is a mihrab, next to a simple minbar, made of four stone steps. The site of Khirbet Masub was immediately to the east of Bassa, in which was found the Phoenician Masub inscription. Culture Henry Baker Tristram during his 1863 visit to the village made a detailed description of the women's Palestinian costumes. Weir, after quoting what Tristram wrote about the head-dresses in Al-Bussah, notes that coin headdresses went out of use for daily wear in Galilee at the beginning of the 20th century, but continued to be worn by brides for their weddings.Weir, 1989, pp.175-176 See also *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus References Bibliography * * (p. 333) *Cohen, A.

Category:Former populated places in Israel Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:District of Acre ","title":"Al-Bassa"},{"id":"267482","text":"Al-Birwa (, also spelled al-Birweh) was a Palestinian Arab village, located east of Acre (Akka). In 1945, it had a population of 1,460, of whom the majority were Muslims and a significant minority, Christians. Its total land area consisted of 13,542 dunams (13.5 square kilometers). The village was depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Al-Birwa was mentioned in the mid-11th century CE by the Persian geographer Nasir Khusraw and was known to the Crusaders as \\"Broet\\". The village came under Mamluk rule in the late 13th century, and in the early 16th century, it was conquered by the Ottomans, who ruled it for four centuries. Travelers' reports from the late 19th century documented that al-Birwa had a mosque, a church and an elementary school for boys (a girls' school was built in 1942). During British Mandate rule in Palestine, al-Birwa was home to local power brokers, who mediated disputes in neighboring villages. Al-Birwa became a center of rebel operations during the 1936‚Äì1939 revolt against British rule. By the 1940s, many of the village's agrarian inhabitants lost their lands due to debt, and shifted to labor jobs in nearby cities, such as Haifa. However, the majority of the residents‚Äîmen and women‚Äîcontinued to engage in farming, selling their olives, grains and other crops in the markets of Acre. Al-Birwa was captured by the Israelis in early June 1948, after which its local militia recaptured the village. Al- Birwa was then permanently occupied by the Israelis in late June. Afterward, its inhabitants, including future Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, fled to nearby villages or Lebanon. The Jewish communities of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on al-Birwa's lands in 1949 and 1950, respectively. History =Antiquity= The more ancient site, Tel Birwa (variant: Tel Berweh), lies about one mile southwest of the Arab village by the same name, and is said to be a mound measuring 600 paces in circumference at the top, and 75 feet high. The mound abounds with Graeco-Roman potsherds, showing that it was occupied down to Roman times when it was abandoned, as no distinctively Arab pottery could be found there.Albright (1921/1922), p. 27 Conder and Kitchener thought that Al-Birwa preserves in its name the more ancient name of Beri (), mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (Pesahim iv.1 [26a]), seeing that both it and Kabul are mentioned together.Conder & Kitchener (1881), p. 270; cf. references to same place in the Tosefta (Mo'ed ·∏≤a·π≠an 2:16) and Babylonian Talmud (Baba Kama 80a; Eruvin 45a). Others, dissenting, think that Beri is to be recognised in the name Biriyya, ca. 2 km. north of Safed. According to Josephus, the villages in the immediate vicinity of Kabul were pillaged and burnt during the First Jewish revolt against Rome.Josephus, The Jewish War (2.18.9). As pointed out by , the translators of The Jewish War in 2.18.9 and in 3.3.1. have, in both cases, transcribed the Greek word Cabul (Gr. ŒßŒ±Œ≤ŒøœÖŒªœéŒΩ), used there for this city in the original text, as Zabulon. = Middle Ages = Al-Birwa was mentioned in 1047 CE, during Fatimid rule, when it was visited by the Persian geographer, Nasir Khusraw. He describes it as lying \\"between Acre and Damun\\", and reports having visited what he described as the tombs of Simeon and Esau there. The Crusaders wrested control of Palestine from the Fatimids in 1099. They referred to al-Birwa as \\"Broet\\". In 1253, John Aleman, the Crusader lord of Caesarea, sold al-Birwa, along with several other villages, to the Knights Hospitaller.Delaville Le Roulx 1883, p. 184; cited in Clermont-Ganneau, 1888, pp. 309‚Äì310; cited in R√∂hricht 1893, RRH, p. 319, No. 1210. Al-Birwa was mentioned as part of the Acre-based Crusaders' domain in the 1283 hudna (truce agreement) with the Mamluks under Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun. In the late 13th century, the Mamluks defeated and conquered the last Crusader outposts along Palestine's northern coastline. = Ottoman Empire = Al-Birwa came under Ottoman rule in 1517, along with all of Palestine. In 1596, al-Birwa was a small village in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). The village paid taxes on wheat, barley, fruit, beehives, and goats.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah 1977, p. 190, quoted in Khalidi 1992, p. 9. According to Ottoman tax registers, al-Birwa had 121 residents in 1596. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by French cartographer Pierre Jacotin depicted al-Birwa as \\"Beroweh\\", though its location on the map was misplaced.Karmon 1960, p. 162. In the late 19th century, al-Birwa grew to be a large village, with a well in its southern area. To the north lay \\"beautiful olive-groves and fruitful wheatfields,\\" as they were described by one Western traveller to the region in the mid-19th century.van de Velde 1858, p.223. American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited al-Birwa in 1852 and noted that it was one of 18 villages in Palestine with an operating Christian (Eastern Orthodox) church. By 1859, British Consul Edward T. Rogers recorded that al-Birwa had approximately 900 inhabitants. The French explorer, Victor Gu√©rin, who visited in 1875, described the Christians of Birwa as Greek Orthodox, and noted that they had a \\"fairly new\\" church. A population list from about 1887 showed that al-Birwa had about 755 inhabitant, of whom 650 were Muslims and 105 were Christians.Schumacher, 1888, p. 176 In 1888, the Ottomans built an elementary school for boys. = British Mandate = Al-Birwa from a distance, 1928 In 1917, during World War I, British forces drove out the Ottomans from Palestine and in 1920, the British Mandate of Palestine was established. In the 1922 British census, al-Birwa had a population of 807, consisting of 735 Muslims and 72 Christians.Barron 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 37. The Christians were mostly Orthodox with five Anglicans.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 50. By the 1931 census, the population had increased to 996, of which 884 were Muslims and 92 were Christians, living in a total of 224 houses. Cement roofs became widely used in al-Birwa in the 1930s, during a time of significant expansion in the village. A number of al-Birwa's inhabitants participated in the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine. A commander of the revolt for the Nazareth-Tiberias region, Sheikh Yihya Hawash, was from al-Birwa. He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment. The British also executed eight residents of al-Birwa who had participated in the revolt. Other rebel commanders and participants in the revolt from al-Birwa included Asad Atallah, Mahmoud al- Joudi, Saleh Mahmoud Me'ari-Abu Sa'ud, Abd al-Hamid Daher Me'ari, Muhammad al- Hajj Ali, Yusef Taha, Fadil Eid, Yousif Mai and Abbas al-Shattawi. A number of women from al-Birwa participated in the revolt by transporting arms, water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity. Elderly refugees from al-Birwa interviewed in 2003‚Äì2004 recalled that during the revolt, local rebels set off a mine that hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al-Birwa in August 1937, prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village. In particular, the British authorities gathered men from al-Birwa and forced them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placed the men on top of the cactuses. In the 1945 statistics, al-Birwa's population was 1,460, of which 130 were Christians. Prominent families and landowners in the village included the Saad, Darwish, Abdullah, Kayyal, Sakkas, al-Wakid, al- Joudi, Najm, al-Dabdoub, Khalid, Akawi, Hissian, Hawash and al-Sheikha families. Socio-economic status in the village was largely determined by land ownership. About 140 residents of the village were tenant farmers who worked for the major landowning Moughrabi, al-Zayyat and Adlabi families. According to intelligence gathered by the Haganah (a Jewish paramilitary organization in Palestine), the traditional, local power brokers of the central Galilee were residents of al-Birwa, who \\"resolved all conflicts in the nearby villages\\". Haganah intelligence also reported that al-Birwa's inhabitants were \\"long- lived, the majority reaching an age of over 100 years\\". By the 1940s, al-Birwa had three olive oil presses, a mosque, a church, and approximately 300 houses. In addition to the Ottoman-era boys' school, an elementary school for girls was established in 1943. By this time, many of the inhabitants lost all or part of their lands due to debts, and concurrently, men and women from al- Birwa increasingly worked in public projects, such as road construction and the Haifa oil refinery, or in British military installations, to compensate for lost income. However, the main source of income remained agriculture, and the village's principal crops were olives, wheat, barley, corn, sesame, and watermelons. In 1944/45, residents of the village owned a total of 600 cattle, 3,000 goats and 1,000 chickens. Women, particularly young women from smaller landowning families, participated alongside the men of their family in working the land, while many women from landless families drew income as seasonal workers on other village residents' lands. There were general, gender-based divisions of labor, with women collecting well water, raising livestock, curdling milk, transporting goods to markets in Acre and collecting herbs; men typically plowed and sowed seeds, and both men and women picked olives and harvested crops. = Israel = Israeli forces from the Carmeli Brigade first captured al-Birwa and positions overlooking it on 11 June 1948 as part of Operation Ben-Ami, a day before the first truce of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, 45 elderly residents hid in the church with the priest. The defenders of the village surrendered after losing men and running out of ammunition. The residents took refuge in nearby villages for thirteen days.Nazzal 1978, pp.65‚Äì70, quoted in Khalidi 1992, p. 10. Nevertheless, clashes continued during the truce. According to local militiamen from al- Birwa, 96 men from the village armed with rifles, and an equal number of men armed with non-firearms and unarmed women assembled near the front lines of the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). The rifle-armed force charged first across the front lines, followed by the men armed with axes, shovels, and sticks, and then the women who carried water to assist the wounded. Al-Birwa's ad-hoc militia took the small force of Haganah soldiers (who became part of the Israel Defense Forces on 26 May) by surprise and forced them back a kilometer west of al-Birwa. Afterward, al-Birwa's residents harvested their crops. They remained in the village until 24 June, when ALA commanders suggested that they join their families in the nearby villages. The militiamen claimed that the ALA stood by during the clashes because they did not receive orders from their superiors. The Israelis announced that they had battled ALA units in the area, inflicting 100 casualties on 25 June. The New York Times reported that there was fighting in the village for two days and that United Nations (UN) observers were there investigating truce violations. It added that \\"a small Israeli garrison held al-Birwa prior to the [first] truce\\", but it fell to ALA troops based in Nazareth who launched a surprise attack. Some residents camped in the outskirts of the village and occasionally managed to enter and gather personal belongings. After the end of the first truce in mid-July, al-Birwa was captured by Israel during Operation Dekel. The ALA fought the Israelis to recapture al-Birwa, but by 18 July, the village was firmly behind Israeli lines. On 20 August 1948, the Jewish National Fund called for building a settlement on some of al-Birwa's lands, and on 6 January 1949, Yas'ur, a kibbutz, was established there. In 1950, the moshav of Ahihud was inaugurated on the village's western lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one of al-Birwa's schools, two shrines for local sages, and three houses remained standing as of 1982. One of the shrines was domed and built of stone. Most of the structures stood amid cacti, weeds, olive and fig groves, and mulberry trees. Most of al-Birwa's inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages, including Tamra, Kabul, Jadeidi, Kafr Yasif, and other localities. In Jadeidi the refugees of al-Birwa mostly resided in a neighborhood called al-Barawneh after their village of origin or alternatively al-Kayyali after the Kayyal family, many of whom lived in the neighborhood and one of whom, Afif Kayyal, was elected mayor in the 1990s and in 2003.Boqa'i 2005, pp. 80, 85. Some fled to Lebanon, and ended up in the Shatila refugee camp, in the outskirts of Beirut, where Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal interviewed them in 1973.Nazzal 1978, pp. 65‚Äì70 Among the refugees of al-Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish, who was born in the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there. In 1950, Tawfik Toubi, an Arab member of the Knesset, raised the issue of the internally displaced refugees of al-Birwa in the Knesset, demanding that they be allowed to return to their homes. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion replied in the negative, stating, \\"The questioner presented the facts inaccurately. Birwa is an abandoned village which was destroyed in the fighting. Its inhabitants cooperated with Kaukji's gangs. The Israel Defense Forces and the government did not treat them as they deserved, but permitted them to remain in villages near Birwa, and to become residents of Israel. The government of Israel treats them as it does the other residents of Israel and those lacking means of subsistence. A special body was established to deal with these refugees, to resettle and rehabilitate them, not necessarily in their former villages, and the resettlement of the refugees in Nazareth has already begun.\\" In December 1951, the village site was declared a closed military zone. Geography Al-Birwa stood on a rocky hill overlooking the plain of Acre, with an average elevation of 60 meters above sea level. It was situated at the intersection of two highways‚Äîone led to Acre and the other towards Haifa. Located 10.5 kilometers east of Acre, the other nearest localities to al-Birwa included al-Damun (depopulated in 1948) to the south, and the Arab towns of Jadeidi to the northwest, Julis to the north, Sha'ab to the east, and Majd al-Kurum to the northeast. Al-Birwa's total land area consisted of 13,542 dunams (13.42 hectares), of which 59 dunams were built-up areas. Cultivable land accounted for 77% of the total land area. Orchards were planted on 1,548 dunams of which 1,500 were used for olive groves, and 8,457 dunams were allotted to grains. The residents of the town sold 536 dunams to Jews, and most of the rest was Arab-owned. =Archaeology= In October 2002, a salvage excavation was conducted at the site of al-Birwa on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Finds included a large building, numerous potsherds from the Late Roman period, a bronze coin from the 1st or 2nd century CE, remains of an ancient olive press, glass vessels such as a wine goblet and bottles dated to the Late Byzantine and Umayyad periods (7th and first half of 8th centuries CE) and an underground water reservoir. A few potsherds from the Crusader and Mamluk periods were also found.

It relies on the axiomatic method and the tools directly related to them, that is, compass and straightedge, to draw conclusions and solve problems. Only after the introduction of coordinate methods was there a reason to introduce the term \\"synthetic geometry\\" to distinguish this approach to geometry from other approaches. Other approaches to geometry are embodied in analytic and algebraic geometries, where one would use analysis and algebraic techniques to obtain geometric results. According to Felix Klein > Synthetic geometry is that which studies figures as such, without recourse > to formulae, whereas analytic geometry consistently makes use of such > formulae as can be written down after the adoption of an appropriate system > of coordinates. Geometry as presented by Euclid in the Elements is the quintessential example of the use of the synthetic method. It was the favoured method of Isaac Newton for the solution of geometric problems. Synthetic methods were most prominent during the 19th century when geometers rejected coordinate methods in establishing the foundations of projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometries. For example the geometer Jakob Steiner (1796 ‚Äì 1863) hated analytic geometry, and always gave preference to synthetic methods. Logical synthesis The process of logical synthesis begins with some arbitrary but definite starting point. This starting point is the introduction of primitive notions or primitives and axioms about these primitives: * Primitives are the most basic ideas. Typically they include both objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things such as points, lines and planes, while a fundamental relationship is that of incidence ‚Äì of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. Hilbert once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs, the point being that the primitive terms are just empty placeholders and have no intrinsic properties. * Axioms are statements about these primitives; for example, any two points are together incident with just one line (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are the building blocks of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have. From a given set of axioms, synthesis proceeds as a carefully constructed logical argument. When a significant result is proved rigorously, it becomes a theorem. =Properties of axiom sets= There is no fixed axiom set for geometry, as more than one consistent set can be chosen. Each such set may lead to a different geometry, while there are also examples of different sets giving the same geometry. With this plethora of possibilities, it is no longer appropriate to speak of \\"geometry\\" in the singular. Historically, Euclid's parallel postulate has turned out to be independent of the other axioms. Simply discarding it gives absolute geometry, while negating it yields hyperbolic geometry. Other consistent axiom sets can yield other geometries, such as projective, elliptic, spherical or affine geometry. Axioms of continuity and \\"betweeness\\" are also optional, for example, discrete geometries may be created by discarding or modifying them. Following the Erlangen program of Klein, the nature of any given geometry can be seen as the connection between symmetry and the content of the propositions, rather than the style of development. History Euclid's original treatment remained unchallenged for over two thousand years, until the simultaneous discoveries of the non-Euclidean geometries by Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky and Riemann in the 19th century led mathematicians to question Euclid's underlying assumptions.Mlodinow 2001, Part III The Story of Gauss One of the early French analysts summarized synthetic geometry this way: :The Elements of Euclid are treated by the synthetic method. This author, after having posed the axioms, and formed the requisites, established the propositions which he proves successively being supported by that which preceded, proceeding always from the simple to compound, which is the essential character of synthesis.S. F. Lacroix (1816) Essais sur L'Enseignement en G√©n√©ral, et sur celui des Math√©matiques en Particulier, page 207, Libraire pur les Math√©matiques. The heyday of synthetic geometry can be considered to have been the 19th century, when analytic methods based on coordinates and calculus were ignored by some geometers such as Jakob Steiner, in favor of a purely synthetic development of projective geometry. For example, the treatment of the projective plane starting from axioms of incidence is actually a broader theory (with more models) than is found by starting with a vector space of dimension three. Projective geometry has in fact the simplest and most elegant synthetic expression of any geometry. In his Erlangen program, Felix Klein played down the tension between synthetic and analytic methods: ::On the Antithesis between the Synthetic and the Analytic Method in Modern Geometry: :The distinction between modern synthesis and modern analytic geometry must no longer be regarded as essential, inasmuch as both subject-matter and methods of reasoning have gradually taken a similar form in both. We choose therefore in the text as common designation of them both the term projective geometry. Although the synthetic method has more to do with space-perception and thereby imparts a rare charm to its first simple developments, the realm of space-perception is nevertheless not closed to the analytic method, and the formulae of analytic geometry can be looked upon as a precise and perspicuous statement of geometrical relations. On the other hand, the advantage to original research of a well formulated analysis should not be underestimated, - an advantage due to its moving, so to speak, in advance of the thought. But it should always be insisted that a mathematical subject is not to be considered exhausted until it has become intuitively evident, and the progress made by the aid of analysis is only a first, though a very important, step.Felix Klein (1872) Ralf Stephan translator (2006) \\"A comparative review of researches in geometry\\" The close axiomatic study of Euclidean geometry led to the construction of the Lambert quadrilateral and the Saccheri quadrilateral. These structures introduced the field of non- Euclidean geometry where Euclid's parallel axiom is denied. Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachevski independently constructed hyperbolic geometry, where parallel lines have an angle of parallelism that depends on their separation. This study became widely accessible through the Poincar√© disc model where motions are given by M√∂bius transformations. Similarly, Riemann, a student of Gauss's, constructed Riemannian geometry, of which elliptic geometry is a particular case. Another example concerns inversive geometry as advanced by Ludwig Immanuel Magnus, which can be considered synthetic in spirit. The closely related operation of reciprocation expresses analysis of the plane. Karl von Staudt showed that algebraic axioms, such as commutativity and associativity of addition and multiplication, were in fact consequences of incidence of lines in geometric configurations. David Hilbert showedDavid Hilbert, 1980 (1899). The Foundations of Geometry, 2nd edition, ¬ß22 Desargues Theorem, Chicago: Open Court that the Desargues configuration played a special role. Further work was done by Ruth Moufang and her students. The concepts have been one of the motivators of incidence geometry. When parallel lines are taken as primary, synthesis produces affine geometry. Though Euclidean geometry is both an affine and metric geometry, in general affine spaces may be missing a metric. The extra flexibility thus afforded makes affine geometry appropriate for the study of spacetime, as discussed in the history of affine geometry. In 1955 Herbert Busemann and Paul J. Kelley sounded a nostalgic note for synthetic geometry: :Although reluctantly, geometers must admit that the beauty of synthetic geometry has lost its appeal for the new generation. The reasons are clear: not so long ago synthetic geometry was the only field in which the reasoning proceeded strictly from axioms, whereas this appeal ‚Äî so fundamental to many mathematically interested people ‚Äî is now made by many other fields.Herbert Busemann and Paul J. Kelly (1953) Projective Geometry and Projective Metrics, Preface, page v, Academic Press For example, college studies now include linear algebra, topology, and graph theory where the subject is developed from first principles, and propositions are deduced by elementary proofs. Today's student of geometry has axioms other than Euclid's available: see Hilbert's axioms and Tarski's axioms. Ernst K√∂tter published a (German) report in 1901 on \\"The development of synthetic geometry from Monge to Staudt (1847)\\"; (2012 Reprint as ) Proofs using synthetic geometry Synthetic proofs of geometric theorems make use of auxiliary constructs (such as helping lines) and concepts such as equality of sides or angles and similarity and congruence of triangles. Examples of such proofs can be found in the articles Butterfly theorem, Angle bisector theorem, Apollonius' theorem, British flag theorem, Ceva's theorem, Equal incircles theorem, Geometric mean theorem, Heron's formula, Isosceles triangle theorem, Law of cosines, and others that are linked to here. Computational synthetic geometry In conjunction with computational geometry, a computational synthetic geometry has been founded, having close connection, for example, with matroid theory. Synthetic differential geometry is an application of topos theory to the foundations of differentiable manifold theory.

This is one of the things that discipline ‚Äì training ‚Äì is about\\". -James Cringe Clavell, Sh≈çgun (1975). Discipline is action or inaction that is regulated to be in accordance (or to achieve accord) with a particular system of governance. Discipline is commonly applied to regulating human and animal behavior to its society or environment it belongs. In the academic and professional worlds a discipline is a specific branch of knowledge, learning or practice. Discipline can be a set of expectations that are required by any governing entity including the self, groups, classes, fields, industries, or societies. Use of the word discipline Children being educated to use public litter bins is a form of disciplinary education that is expected by some societies. Discipline is followed in every school. If a child cannot use a litter bin the lack of discipline can result in a reaction from observant people in public. Many people observe a form of disciplinary effort in their daily lives. Discipline acts as an important role in students' campus life to enhance their credit and intellectual recognition amongst peers. In academia, discipline can also regard the educators' responses and efforts that are designed to punish the student(s). Discipline is a moral obligation among many groups of people. Disciplined behavior is required by some laws and other legal obligations. Commercial entities can also put in place strict disciplinary requirements for the length of the commercial agreement. Airlines enforce strict disciplinary and conduct rules upon flight passengers. History Disciplinarians have been involved in many societies throughout history. The Victorian era resulted in the popular use of disciplinarian governance over children. Edward VIII had a disciplinarian father, and the English had modelled the royal families during this era. Edward's grandmother was Queen Victoria who had championed the role of the family unit during her reign. A disciplinarian will enforce a stricter set of rules that are aimed at developing children according to theories of order and discipline. Disciplinarians have also been linked to child abuse in numerous cases and biographies. Self-discipline Self- discipline is about creating new habits of thought, action, and speech toward improving oneself and to reach institutional goals. This is an alternative to viewing discipline as a means to obtain more information. =In religion= Self-discipline is an important principal in several religious systems. For example, in Buddhist ethics as outlines in the Noble Eightfold Path, the element of commitment to harmony and self-restraint has been described as moral discipline.Bodhi (2005), p. 153. In Christian ethics, virtues directed by the beatitudes where formally replaced by ascetical theology and obedience- based discipline, which changed orientation from the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, to that of an authority, blessed but not possessing the same happiness which was given forth by adherence and observances. Medieval period spirituality and morality where used to mean synonymous or near practically the same belief system. The beatitudes were made an organizational principle since Saint Augustine. However, Christian ethics didn't have its existence as a form of discipline until the late, middle Medieval period, and along Lutheranism and post-Enlightenment obedience-based discipline has been the new form. Alexander Maclaren suggested the duty and discipline of grace and the hope born of and carried throughout life can be described as follows: > 'grace' means the sum of the felicities [happiness] of a future life. That > is clear from two considerations ‚Äî that this grace is the object of our hope > all through life, which only an object beyond the grave can be, and also > that its advent is contemporaneous with the revelation of Jesus Christ. The > expression, though unusual, is valuable because it brings out two things. It > reminds us that whatever of blessedness we may possess in the future it is > all a gratuitous, unmerited gift of that loving God to whom we owe > everything.\\" Self-discipline is the means by which our self-control is gained, and the way our hope is maintained. \\"Hope follows desire. The vigour of our hopes is affected by the warmth of our desires. The warmth of our desires towards the future depends largely on the turning away of our desires from the present. Common Techniques *Time management is a form of discipline that utilizes time as the regulator and the observer of time as the governor. The requirement is for time to be used efficiently. This activity maximizes the result of a set of activities by marking each activity within a boundary of time. To improve efficiency activities that are not necessary to completing the current activity or goal should be completed separately without interruption, this is the alternative to multi-tasking. Time management can utilize skills, tools, or techniques to create specific time allotments according to a range of organization methods. Time management for discipline scheduling should involve focusing on one task, clearly defining what we plan to undertake and focus on what we are doing rather than focusing on alternative ways during its completion. A major theme arising from time management is that of modifying behavior to ensure compliance with time- related deadlines. It may be utilized by an emphasis on completing goals rather than a specific task, completing short and non-urgent tasks first, complete urgent and high importance tasks second and make progress on less urgent tasks which are time consuming in the middle of the working day. More commonly segregating operations to different individuals as opposed to overlapping activities, more efficiently organizing and completing tasks, this may however increase the need for supervision, non-group fixed milestones and intermittent reports. This theme is interrelated with discipline and methods of discipline that can be used to incentivize group or personal responsibility and reducing wasted hours by performance drops or irrelevant tasks to completing a deadline. Time management is about non-punitive scheduling and goal-oriented programs. Team based time management is exemplified by good questioning. Meeting times can be significantly reduced by asking why we need to meet to accomplish this, what will we do differently if we succeed and how will this further the vision or goals of our team, group or organization?https://anderschristianhjort.com/2019/01/20/3-acid-test- questions-cut-meeting-times-by-90/ *Responsibility-based discipline co-opts the members to understand remedies for problems in an organization. Responsibility includes laying out instructions for modifying future behavior by following good role models who have earned esteem. Rewards and punishments may be ineffective without someone to administer them. Responsibility-based discipline is about mimicking the warmth, democratic decision-making in setting ground rules and problem-solving, this is while maintaining dignity and observing clear limits. Sending frequent reminders about how the member can meet the performance indicators, organizational objectives, why the rules should be adhered to or useful advice on meeting the rules day-to-day. Obedience-based discipline is basing membership by the hard work, diligence, obedience to authority, and self-discipline.Coopersmith, S. (1967).The antecedents of self-esteem. San Francisco: Freeman.Coopersmith, S. (1975). Developing motivation in young children. San Francisco: Albion. *Corporal punishment is a widely debated technique of discipline that can focus on spanking, slapping, whipping, deprivation or hitting with an object using mild to extreme degrees of force. The general aim is to instill an understanding of consequence in the subject. Punishment can be used to instil immediate compliance as it acts as a reminder to the offender that there are consequences to their actions, especially when it comes to breaking the law. To deter would be offenders. To provide a disincentive for not acting when requiring to act, when safety to others necessitates action, increase pain to adjust to a regiment whose misoperation or miscalculation results in injury, damage to equipment or unnecessary delays and to efficiently, productively and effectively carry out ones duty, particularly when it is of high importance to their rank, society and personal gratification.

Geography The village was located 26 km northeast of the city of Acre, on a rocky hill about 5 km south of the Lebanese border. It was linked by a paved road to Fassuta in the north and Tarshiha in the southwest. The road divided the town into an eastern and one western quarter, or haras, the eastern quarter being higher up.Khalidi, 1992, p. 12 History The first part of the village name, Dayr (\\"monastery\\") suggest that the village might have had a monastery and a Christian population. However, in modern times the population was Muslim. According to the residents of the village, ancient artifacts from the Canaanite, Israelite and Roman period were unearthed in the Ottoman and British Mandate period. Ceramics from the late Roman and the Byzantine eras have been found here.Dauphin, 1998, p. 648 In the Crusader era it was known as Cassie, and in 1183 it was noted that Godfrey de Tor sold the land of the village to Joscelin III.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 15-16, No. 16; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 125, No. 624; cited in Frankel, 1988, pp. 257, 264 In 1220 Jocelyn III's daughter Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg, sold their land, including Cassie and the nearby Roeis (Khirbet Tell ‚Äòer-Ruwesah/Tel Rosh), to the Teutonic Knights.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 43- 44, No. 53; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 248, No. 934; cited in Frankel, 1988, pp. 257, 264. Remains from the Mamluk era have been found in the area.Lerer, 2011, Elqosh =Ottoman era= Dayr al-Qassi was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and it belonged to the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira, part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). In the 1596 tax records Dayr al-Qassi had a population of 24 Muslim household; an estimated 132 persons. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rated of 25% on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as well as on goats and beehives; a total of 345 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 177. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 12Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In the early 18th century, Dayr al-Qassi was a fortified village controlled by a local sheikh (chief) named Abd al-Khaliq Salih. In 1740, Sheikh Zahir al-Umar, an Arab mutasallim (tax collector) from the al-Zayadina clan whose strength was growing throughout the Galilee, struggled to gain control of Dayr al- Qassi. Later that year, he made the village part of his domain by marrying Sheikh Salih's daughter, thereby sealing an alliance with the latter's clan.Joudah, 1987, p. 24. In late 1767, Zahir's son Ali of Safad requested control of Dayr al-Qassi from his father after his request for Dayr Hanna was rejected. Zahir refused and the two entered into an armed conflict, which Zahir won. Nonetheless, Zahir pardoned Ali and ultimately ceded the village to him.Joudah, 1987, p. 53. In 1838, Deir el-Kasy was noted as a Muslim village in the El Jebel district, located west of Safad.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2nd appendix, p. 133 Victor Gu√©rin visited Dayr al-Qassi in 1875, and he estimated that the village had 350 Muslim inhabitants. In 1881, Dayr al-Qassi was described in the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) as being situated on a ridge, encircled by fig trees, olive trees and arable land. It then had a population of about 200.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.197. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 12 A population list from about 1887 showed Deir el Kasy to have about 945 inhabitants, all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 190 =British Mandate period= Two women from Dayr al-Qassi, 1937 At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate, Dair Wal Qasi had a population of 663, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 increasing in the 1931 census, when Deir el Qasi had a population of 865, still all Muslims, living in a total of 169 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 106.

The village's residents were expelled on 27 May 1949 and most migrated north into Lebanon. By June, 1949, it was noted that the whole northern area had been \\"Judaised\\", including Tarshiha, Suhmata, Dayr al-Qassi, Tarbikha, Meiron, Al- Sammu'i, Safsaf and Al-Ras al-Ahmar.Morris, 2004, pp. 381-382, note #226 Elkosh, established in 1949, occupies part of the village site.

This species is often referred to as the Chinese white dolphin in China (including Macao), Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore as a common name. Some biologists regard the Indo-Pacific dolphin as a subspecies of the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (S. plumbea) which ranges from East Africa to India. However, DNA testing studies have shown that the two are distinct species. Additionally, a new species (the Australian humpback dolphin (S. sahulensis)) has just recently been split off from S. chinensis and recognized as a distinct species. Nevertheless, there are still several unresolved issues in differentiation of the Indian Ocean-type and Indo-Pacific-type humpback dolphins.  Description  Tail with visible grey and pink colours An adult Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is grey, white or pink and may appear as an albino dolphin to some. Uniquely, the population along the Chinese coast has pink skin,WWF Hong Kong. Wwf.org.hk. Retrieved 2014-05-15. and the pink colour originates not from a pigment, but from blood vessels which were overdeveloped for thermoregulation. The body length is for adults for infants. An adult weighs . Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins live up to 40 years, as determined by the analysis of their teeth. At birth, the dolphins are black. They change to grey, then pinkish with spots when young. Adults are grey, white or pink.  Behaviour  Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins come to the water surface to breathe for 20 to 30 seconds before diving deep again, for two to eight minutes. Dolphin calves, with smaller lung capacities, surface twice as often as adults, staying underwater for one to three minutes. Adult dolphins rarely stay under water for more than four minutes. They sometimes leap completely out of the water. They may also rise up vertically from the water, exposing the dorsal half of their bodies. A pair of protruding eyes allows them to see clearly in both air and water.  Reproductive cycle  Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins are sociable creatures and live in groups of three to four. Female dolphins become mature at 10 years old, while the males become mature at 13 years old. They usually mate from the end of summer to autumn. Infant dolphins are usually born 11 months after the mating. Mature females can give birth every three years, and parental care lasts until their offspring can find food themselves. Humans and the environment The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is threatened by both habitat loss and pollution. Conservationists warn that Hong Kong may lose its rare Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, also known as pink dolphins for their unique colour, unless China takes urgent action against pollution and other threats. Their numbers in Hong Kong waters have fallen from an estimated 158 in 2003 to just 78 in 2011, with a further decline expected by the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society. A tour guide from Hong Kong Dolphinwatch spotted a group of pink dolphins helping a mother support the body of her dead calf above the water in an attempt to revive it. The scene, captured on video and widely shared on Facebook, has raised fresh concerns about the dwindling population in a city where dolphin watching is a tourist attraction. \\"We‚Äôre 99 percent certain the calf died from toxins in the mother‚Äôs milk, accumulated from polluted seawater,\\" said Hong Kong Dolphinwatch spokeswoman Janet Walker, who added it was the third such incident reported in April alone.

Plastic pollution is widespread across all entangling oceans due to their buoyant and durable properties that allow for sorption of toxicants to plastic while traveling through the environment. This lead researchers to the conclusion that synthetic polymers are hazardous to marine life and should be declared as a hazardous waste type. There are many transit paths that allow for plastics and pollutions to enter oceans. Freshwater waste can enter oceans by rivers; delta or estuary (where rivers meet the ocean). Human populations discarding their waste directly into marine waters. Through photo-degradation and other forms of weathering processes that aid in plastics fragmentation and dispersal. Mass quantities of fragmented plastics - along with pollution are aggregated in subtropical gyres; ocean gyres. Plastic accumulation is not limited to ocean gyres; closed bays, gulfs and seas surrounded by densely populated coastlines and watersheds are all susceptible.Plastic waste: Large build-ups like this can interfere with echolocation\\"The Pearl River Delta is an estuary within the proximity of one of the many ocean gyres that the Humpback dolphin inhabits.

Plastic pollution can severely affect all forms of marine life; Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins are specifically affected in an array of means. Bioaccumulation:Plastic pollutants traveling from lower- trophic levels to higher-trophic levels.Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) are chronically exposed to organic pollutants since they inhabit shallow coastal waters that are often impacted by anthropogenic activities. Anthropogenic pollutants pose a risk to marine mammals that reside in coastal waters. Discharge of organic pollutants into marine environments has been shown to decrease water quality resulting in loss of habitats and a significant reduction in the species richness (Johnston and Roberts, 2009). The loss of key pods have caused specie fragmentation, also due to habitat loss, which inclines specie isolation; decrease connectivity resulting in population decline. This loss in population is what lead this species to be labeled as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The consumption of plastics have adverse effects in marine mammals such as disease susceptibility, reproductive and developmental toxicity. Constant absorption of organic pollutants like plastic can be transferred into the dolphin's tissues and organs through an ingestion pathway that is impacting megafauna, lower trophic levels and predators (not limited to Indo-Pacific) Organ toxicity can lead to organ failure, loss of offsprings and milk toxicity. If the dolphin is not consuming plastic directly then it can have plastic pollutants ingested though biomagnification and bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation is defined as the uptake of chemicals from the environment through dietary intake, dermal absorption or respiratory transport in air or water. This is a huge factor is plastic toxicity consumption in this species due to them having long lifespans which makes them susceptible to chronic exposure. Also, they contain a large quantity of blubber, lipids, which can result in an excess of toxicity storage in their tissues. Echolocation, also known as sonar Echolocation is a main sense that all dolphins use to navigate and pinpoint prey and predators. Dolphins and whales use echolocation by bouncing high-pitched clicking sounds off underwater objects, similar to shouting and listening for echoes. The sounds are made by squeezing air through nasal passages near the blowhole. These sound-waves then pass into the forehead, where a big blob of fat called the melon focuses them into a beam. This process can be interrupted by large composites of waste that can range from oil, plastics and noise. The large blockage can refract sound-waves that give the dolphin a false inclination that there is possible prey, kin or a predator in the area. This can become confusing and frustrating which can lead to extreme stress and potential health issues. Despite echolocation being mostly affected by noise pollution it can altered by pollutants in marine water. Noise pollution can also be caused by large clusters of plastic debris; ocean gyre. The constant movement of ocean currents will cause the plastic debris, along with general-waste to clash together which entails a production of sound. Sound waves from the debris will travel through marine waters which can become an excess of sound waves traveling can render their use of echolocation. This can inherently leave this species blind since this is their primary sense.

The phrase originates from the Cantonese fisher people, because they claim the dolphins eat the fish in their nets. However, in formal Chinese, it should be written as ÁÉèÈ±ÄÁôΩÈ±Ä, with the gei originally in olden Chinese, meaning dolphins. The wu refers to the finless porpoises, which are black, and the bak, white, referring to Chinese river dolphins. These two species often interrupt and ruin the fishermen's catch. As years passed, because \\"dolphin\\" sounds the same as \\"bad luck\\", the meaning of the phrase changed. However, in Cantonese, wu refers to the calves of Chinese white dolphin and bak refers to the adults. Nowadays, dolphins are not called gei anymore, but Êµ∑Ë±ö (hai tun), literally meaning \\"sea pig\\", with none of the negative connotations for pig found in English.  Eastern Taiwan Strait (ETS) population  The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins were first discovered along the west coast of Taiwan in 2002. Based on a survey done in 2002 and 2003, they are often found in waters <5m deep, and no evidence shows that they appear in water deeper than 15m.Wang, John Y. et al. (eds.) (2007) CONSERVATION ACTION PLAN FOR THE EASTERN TAIWAN STRAIT POPULATION OF INDO-PACIFIC HUMPBACK DOLPHINS. National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium A study in 2008 found that the population of humpback dolphins, which occupies a linear range of about 500 km^2 along the central west coast of Taiwan, is genetically distinct from all populations living in other areas.Population differences in the pigmentation of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in Chinese waters : mammalia. Degruyter.com (17 October 2008). Retrieved 2014-05-15. And this population is called Eastern Taiwan Strait (ETS) population. Taiwan is a densely populated island and highly developed area, which has many industrial development projects, especially along the west coast, where the ETS populations of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins live. Based on data collected between 2002 and 2005, the ETS population of humpback dolphins was less than 100 individuals. Unfortunately, the newest data released in 2012 shows that only 62 individuals are left. It means during those 7 years, population of humpback dolphins is being destroyed constantly and severely. A preliminary examination revealed that the ETS humpback dolphin population meets the IUCN Red List criteria for \\"Critically endangered\\".Sheehy, D.J. (2009) Potential Impacts to Sousa chinensis from a. Proposed Land Reclamation along the West Coast of Taiwan. aquabio.com Without further protection and regulation, this population will go extinct quickly. There are several facts that result in the decreasing number of ETS population of humpback dolphins. First, large-scale modification of the shoreline by industrial development including hydraulic filling for creating industrial or science parks, seawall construction and sand mining cause habitat fragmentation and diminish dolphin's habitats. In addition, exploitation of shoreline also contributes to toxic contamination flows into dolphin's habitats. The chemical pollution from industrial or agricultural and municipal discharge results in impaired health of dolphins, for instance, reproductive disorders, and compromised immune system.Wang, John Y. et al. (eds.) (2004) RESEARCH ACTION PLAN FOR THE HUMPBACK DOLPHINS OF WESTERN TAIWAN. The National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium Second, fishing activities along the west coast of Taiwan are thriving, and cause many impacts on dolphins. Widespread and intensive use of gillnets and vessel strikes are potential threats for dolphins. Over exploitation of fish by fisheries' is another threat for the dolphin population. It has led to disturbance of marine food web or trophic level and reduces marine biodiversity. Therefore, dolphins have not enough prey to live on. Still another problem is reduced amount of freshwater flows into estuaries from rivers. Since ETS population of humpback dolphins is closely associated with estuaries habitat, the elimination of freshwater discharge from rivers significantly decreases the amount of suitable habitats for dolphins. Hydroacoustic disturbance is another critical issue for dolphins. Sources of noise can come from dredging, pile driving, increased vessel traffic, seawall construction, and soil improvement. For all cetaceans, sound is vital for providing information about their environment, communicating with other individuals, and foraging; also, they are very vulnerable and sensitive to the effects of noise. Elevated anthropogenic sound level causes many dysfunctions of their behaviors, and even leads to death. In addition to threats from anthropogenic activities, dolphins are potentially at the risk due to the small population size, which may result in inbreeding and decreased genetic and demographic variability. Finally, climate change causes more typhoons to hit the west coast of Taiwan and cause great disturbance to dolphins' habitats.  Conservation  The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is listed on Appendix II\\"Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009. of the convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co- operation organised by tailored agreements. In the interim of 2003‚Äì2013, the number of these dolphins in the bay around Hong Kong has dwindled from a population of 159 to just 61 individuals, a population decline of 60% in the last decade. The population continues to be further threatened by pollution, vessel collision, overfishing, and underwater noise pollution.Hong Kong's Striking Dolphins Dwindle to Just Dozens  ABC News Blogs ‚Äì Yahoo.

In addition to their natural susceptibility to anthropogenic disturbances, the Chinese white dolphin's late sexual maturity, reduced fecundity, reduced calf survival, and long calving intervals heavily curtails their ability to naturally cope with elevated rates of mortality. In recent years, Taiwan launched the largest Indo-Pacific Humpbacked Dolphin sanctuary on the Taiwanese coast, stretching from Miaoli County to Chiayi County.Perrin F.W., Koch C.C., 2007.

The species are attracted to the Pearl River Estuary because of its brackish waters. * 1765: Pehr Osbeck gives the first scientific description of the species.Carwardine, Mark (2002) Sharks and Whales. DK ADULT. . p. 362. * Late 1980s: Environmentalists started to pay attention to the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin population. * Early 1990: The Hong Kong public started to become aware of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin. This was due to the side effects of the construction of the Chek Lap Kok Airport. It was one of the world's largest single reclamation projects: the reclamation of nine square kilometers of the seabed near Northern Lantau, which was one of the major habitats of the dolphins. * Early 1993: Re-evaluation of the environmental effects of the construction of Chek Lap Kok Airport. This alerted eco-activists such as those from the World Wide Fund for Nature in Hong Kong, in turn bringing media attention on the matter. Soon enough, the Hong Kong Government began getting involved by funding projects to research on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins * Late 1993: The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department was founded. * 1996: Dr. Thomas Jefferson began to conduct research on the Indo- Pacific humpback dolphins in hope of discovering more about them. * 1997: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin became the official mascot of the 1997 sovereignty changing ceremonies in Hong Kong. * 1998: The research results of Dr. Thomas Jefferson was published in \\"Wildlife Monographs\\". * 1998: The Hong Kong Dolphinwatch was organized and began to run dolphin watching tours for the general public to raise the public's awareness of the species. * 2000: The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department started to conduct long- term observation of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Hong Kong. * 2000: The population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has reached around 80‚Äì140 dolphins in the Pearl River waters. * 2014: Dr. Thomas Jefferson and Dr. Howard C. Rosenbaum revised the taxonomy of the humpback dolphins (Sousa spp.). They describe a new species, the Australian humpback dolphin and define the accepted common name for this species, the Indo-Pacific Humpback dolphin.

Like many Arab villages, it had a non-aggression pact with nearby Jewish communities.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 140 In the early months of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the villagers provided the Jewish militia Haganah with intelligence and ammunition in return for an agreement to not enter the village or harm the inhabitants.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 140; Morris, 2004, pp. 515-516. On the other hand, some of the villagers joined in the March 1948 attack on the Jewish convoy to kibbutz Yehiam in which 47 Haganah soldiers were killed.Morris, 2004, pp. 515-516; Nazzal, 1974, p. 71. On May 21, 1948, the Haganah's Carmeli Brigade captured al-Ghabisiyya during Operation Ben-Ami.Morris, 2004, pp. 515-516; Nazzal, 1974, pp. 71-72 The village formally surrendered, but the Carmeli troops \\"entered the village with guns blazing\\", killing several inhabitants. Six villagers who were thought to have taken part in the attack on the Yehiam convoy were apparently then executed.Morris, 2004, p. 254 The villagers fled or were expelled to nearby villages, where they remained until the complete Jewish conquest of the Galilee in October. At that time, many of the residents went to Lebanon while others fled to nearby Arab towns and became Israeli citizens due to their registration in the October‚ÄìNovember census.Nazzal, 1974, p72; Morris, 2004, p. 516 The latter tried repeatedly to settle back in their village. Some apparently obtained permission but others went back illegally. On January 24, 1950, the Military Governor of the Galilee ordered all the residents of al-Ghabisiyya to leave within 48 hours and then declared the village a closed military area.Morris, 2004, p. 516; Jiryis, 1973, p93 No alternative accommodation had been arranged, and the villagers took up temporary residence in abandoned houses of nearby Shaykh Dawud and Sheikh Danun.Morris, 2004, p. 516; Benvenisti, 2000, p. 140 The expulsion caused a public controversy. The leaders of the leftist Mapam party condemned it, but they were undermined by the Mapam-dominated regional Jewish settlements bloc (one Mapam kibbutz of which was already cultivating al-Ghabisiyya's land) which declared that the \\"Arabs of Ghabisiyya should on no account be allowed to return to their village\\".Morris, 2004, p. 516 In September 1950, some of the villagers again resettled the village but were sentenced to several months in prison and given fines. =post‚àí1948= Building remains in Al-Ghabisiyya, 2019 Building remains in Al-Ghabisiyya, 2019 Remains of the mosque in Al- Ghabisiyya, 2019 In 1951, the villagers instituted proceedings against the Military Government in the High Court of Israel. The court ruled that the declaration of the village as a closed area had been improperly instituted, and in consequence \\"the military governor had no authority to evict the petitioners [from the village] and he has no authority to prevent them from entering or leaving it or from residing there.\\"Jiryis 1973, pp93-94; Benvenisti, 2000, p. 140; HC reference 220/51 of November 30, 1951. The military government responded by sealing the village, and two days later again declared it to be a closed military area.Jiryis 1973, p. 94; HC references 288/51 and 33/52. The villagers appealed to the High Court again, but the court ruled that the new declaration was legal and in consequence villagers who had not managed to return to the village before that declaration (which in practice was all of them) were forbidden to go there without permission. The village thus remained deserted. Its lands were officially expropriated and in 1955 its houses were demolished leaving only the large mosque.Benvenisti 2000, p. 140 Later attempts of the villagers to return to the village were not successful.Davar, June 7, 1970, cited in Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 2, No. 1, 1972, p. 147. The villagers set up a committee whose principal activity was to renovate the village cemetery and mosque, and in July 1972 the committee wrote to the prime minister: > In the village a mosque and the cemetery remain.... The mosque is in a run- > down state and the cemetery, where our relatives are buried, is neglected > and overgrown with weeds to such an extent that it is impossible to identify > the graves any more. Knowing that our state authorities have always taken > care of the places of worship and cemeteries of all the ethnic > communities,...

The authorities did not permit the al-Ghabisiyya's residents to carry out the requested renovation of the mosque and cemetery. The land of the village, including the mosque, had been acquired by the Israel Land Administration (ILA) under one of the laws regarding land expropriation, and not the Ministry of Religion, which is responsible for holy places. In 1994 members of the village committee began renovating the mosque and praying there. In January 1996 the ILA sealed the entrance of the mosque, but the villagers broke through the fence and again used the mosque for prayers. The villagers appealed to Prime Minister Shimon Peres in April 1996, they received a reply on his behalf from one of his aides: > The government of Israel regards itself as obligated to maintain the holy > places of all religions, including, of course, cemeteries and mosques sacred > to Islam. The prime minister has stated to the heads of the Arab community, > with whom he recently met, that the government would see to the renovation > and the restoration of the dignity of mosques in abandoned villages, > including the mosque in Ghabisiyya.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 294; Letter dated 26 > May 1996, signed by Benny Shiloh, head of the Minorities Section. However, Shimon Peres was defeated in the next prime ministerial elections, and in March 1997 police surrounded the mosque and representatives from ILA removed copies of the Quran and prayer rugs and once again sealed the entrance of the mosque. The conflict was carried to the court in Acre, where the uprooted villagers contended that the government action was contrary to Israel's \\"Law of Preservation of Holy Places\\". The ILA challenged the villagers right to pray there, and used the illegal eviction of 1951 and the demolition of the village in 1955 as arguments to bolster its claim: > \\"The village of Ghabisiyya was abandoned by its inhabitants and destroyed > during the War for Independence\\".... [the mosque..had stood]..\\"lonely and > neglected\\"...\\"and since it was in a run-down and unstable state that > constituted a threat to the safety of those inside it, it was decided by the > Ministry of Religions to seal it and fence it off.Benvenisti 2000, p. 295; > Appendix to civil case file, Acre Magistrate's Court, file 2085/97. The court declined to issue an injunction permitting worshippers back into the mosque. The Ghabisiyya villagers still pray in the field outside the sealed mosque.Benvenisti 2000, p. 295 See also * List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War * List of villages depopulated during the Arab-Israeli conflict * Internally Displaced Palestinians References Bibliography * * p. 337   * *Jiryis, S.

In 1951, in response to a plea from the Iqrit villagers, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the former residents of Iqrit be allowed to return to their homes. However, before that happened, the IDF, despite awareness of the Supreme Court decision, destroyed the previously Christian village on Christmas Day, 1951. Descendants to this day maintain an outpost in the village church, and bury their dead in its cemetery. All attempts to cultivate its lands are uprooted by the Israeli Lands Administration.Gideon Levy and Alex Levac, 'Drafting the blueprint for Palestinian refugees' right of return,' at Haaretz 4 October 2013: \\"We return to our village only as corpses.‚Äù History =Archaeological sites= Iqrit contains mosaic floors, remains of a wine press, rock-hewn tombs, cisterns, and granite implements. The village also has many other archaeological sites in its vicinity. The Canaanites erected a statue for the god Melqart of Tyre in the village. When the Crusaders occupied Iqrit, they called it Acref. A√ßref is a name still commonly used for the village among surrounding Bedouin tribes. The village area contained numerous archaeological sites. =Ottoman era= Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, Iqrit appeared in the 1596 tax registers as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Akka under the Liwa of Safad with a population numbered 374, and an economy dependent largely on goats, beehives and agriculture. There was a press used for olive or grape production.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah,1977, p. 180. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.15Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1875, Victor Gu√©rin passed by the village. He was told it was \\"very considerable\\" and inhabited by Maronites and Greeks Orthodox.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 125 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) called it Akrith, and described it as \\"A village, built of stone, containing about 100 Christians; there is a modern chapel in the village; it is situated on a tell, with figs, olives, and arable land; there are three springs to the west of the village and fourteen cisterns, rock-cut, to supply water.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 148. Partially quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 15 =British Mandate era= Like a number of other villages in the neighborhood, Iqrit was linked to the coastal highway from Acre to Ras an-Naqura via a secondary road leading to Tarbikha. There were 339 people living in 50 houses in the census of 1931,Mills, 1932, p. 101 and that number rose to 490 by the 1945 statistics; 460 Christians and 30 Muslims, with a total of of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 458 dunams were plantations and irrigable land; 1,088 were used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 80 while 68 dunams were built-up (urban) land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 130 At the moment of their eviction in November 1948, there were 491 citizens in Iqrit, 432 of them Melkites (Greek Catholics), inhabiting the entire area of the village. Some of the 59 Muslims of the village rented their homes in Iqrit, while others built their houses in esh-Shafaya. Only part of the village land was cultivated and the rest was covered with woods of oak, laurel and carob trees. By 1948, the village owned about 600 dunams (600,000 m¬≤) of private property with groves of fig trees that served all inhabitants of Iqrit and the surroundings. The groves covered the hill of al-Bayad, and the remaining cultivated land was used for crops of lentils, as well as tobacco and other fruit trees. There were a private elementary school which was administrated by the Greek Catholic Archdiocese, two natural water springs, and many other water-wells for collected rainwater within the village area, including a large pool for rainwater. There were many threshing floors mainly located between the built-up village lands and the cemetery. The large Melkite (Greek Catholic) church remains standing. =Capture and expulsion= IDF soldiers in Iqrit, 3 November 1948 According to Morris, the villagers of Iqrit were outright expelled by the Israeli Army in November 1948, (together with the villagers of Kafr Bir'im, Nabi Rubin and Tarbikha) \\"without Cabinet knowledge, debate, or approval - though, almost inevitably, they received post facto Cabinet endorsement.\\" While some of the former inhabitants of Iqrit became refugees in Lebanon, most are now internally displaced Palestinians who are also citizens of Israel. Iqrit was captured on October 31, 1948 by the Haganah's Oded Brigade during Operation Hiram, an Israeli offensive which advanced on the coastal road towards Lebanon. Iqrit and Tarbikha surrendered and the villagers stayed in their homes. That situation did not last for long. Iqrit and a number of other villages in the region were affected by a policy known as \\"an Arabless border strip\\". =Expulsion= Six days after its surrender, on 5 November 1948, the Israeli Army ordered the villagers to surrender the village, and that they would be returned in two weeks' time when the military operations were over. Some went to Lebanon and the Israeli Army trucked the majority to Rame, a town between Acre and Safad. Israeli Supreme Court rules in favor of allowing Iqrit residents to return to their village In July 1951, the villagers of Iqrit pleaded their case before Israel's Supreme Court, and the court ruled in favour of the right to return to their village. After this judgement, the Military Government found another justification to prevent them from returning. The villagers appealed to the Supreme Court again and were scheduled to have their case considered on 6 February 1952. IDF ignores Supreme Court decision, destroys Iqrit on Christmas day, 1951 However, on Christmas Day in 1951, Israeli Defense Forces destroyed the village. According to the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs Israeli soldiers took the mukhtar of Iqrit to the top of a nearby hill to force him to watch as Israeli troops blew up every house in the village. In his book Blood Brothers, Father Elias Chacour, who was a child away at school at the time, records the story of what happened, as told to him by his brothers: In its third verdict (February 1952), the court blamed the villagers for depending on promises from the military ruler of Galilee, instead of benefiting from the legal remedy which was given to them by the court in its first relevant verdict. Aftermath to the present-day Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and a number of new Jewish villages were established near or on the village's land, including Shomera (1949 on Tarbikha ruins), Even Menachem (1960) and Gornot HaGalil (1980). Today, only the building of the Melkite Greek Catholic church still stands. There is rubble from the destroyed houses and some fig, grape, almond, olive and other orchards. On the shoulder looking at the road passing by from the north, the cemetery of Iqrit is still located, fenced and annually maintained. There is a cowshed that belongs to the settlement of Shomera, on the western entrance of the village, as well. The first legal action against the state of Israel was brought in 1951 by 5 men of Iqrit when Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari acting as their lawyer was instrumental in gaining the right of return for the men of Iqrit. On 31 July 1951 the Israeli courts recognised the rights of the villagers to their land and their right to return to it. The court said the land was not abandoned and therefore could not be placed under the custodian of enemy property.Joseph L. Ryan, S.J. \\"Refugees within Israel: The Case of the Villages of Kafr Bir'im and Iqrit\\" in 2, no. 4 (Sum. 73): 55-81. In the 1970s, villagers from Iqrit conducted a series of sit-ins in the town's former church over a period of six years, and the case of Iqrit (and of Kafr Bir'im) was frequently covered by the Israeli media. Several prominent Israeli cultural and artistic figures supported the movement to repatriate the Iqrit villagers and public empathy for their plight was widespread. While the Israeli authorities recognized the right to return of the villagers in principle, officials resisted implementing this right. Said Golda Meir in 1972: > It is not only consideration of security [that prevent] an official decision > regarding Bi'rim and Iqrit, but the desire to avoid [setting] a precedent. > We cannot allow ourselves to become more and more entangled and to reach a > point from which we are unable to extricate ourselves.\\"Benvenisti, 2000, pp. > 325-326 Meron Benvenisti notes how it has been argued that the villagers of Iqrit and Bi'rim are not the only present-absentees in Israel, and therefore recognizing their right of return is perceived as setting a \\"dangerous precedent\\" that would be followed by other similar demands. However, Benvenisti himself has argued that it could be a positive precedent if the Iqrit villagers were to be allocated the small amount of empty land they need to establish a community settlement on their own land.Meron Benvenisti: The High Court and fear of return, 3 July 2003, Haaretz The operational name of the Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in 1972 was named after this town and Kafr Bir'im.Morris & Black, 1991, p. 270 In 2003, some of Iqrit's villagers repetitioned the Supreme Court so as to facilitate their return to Iqrit, but the petition was rejected by the court. Villagers continue to hold out hope for their right of return. Recently, four families built their houses opposite the village from west, on a side hill of al-Bayad. Afterwards, in August 2012, a large demonstration was held in the city of Haifa demanding Israel to grant the descendants the right of return to both villages that suffered the same depopulation and destruction, Iqrit and Kafr Bir'im. Since the last Roots Camp in 2012, a group of the village's youngsters decided to stay in the village and conduct their lives as regular villagers; this came as an act of opposition to the Israeli government's continued dismissal of the case.

In 1945, it had a built-up land area of over 2,000 dunums and a population of 360 Arab Muslims. Location The village was located on the north bank of Wadi Karkara, about 1 km south of the Lebanese border, and with a view to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. History A three-aisled Byzantine church (from the 6th or 7th century CE) had been reused as a village house.Pringle, 1993, pp. 250-251Pringle, 1997, p. 51 =Ottoman era= In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin inspected the place, which he described: \\"The ruins of this name are scattered over the flanks and summit of a hill, bordered on the south by the deep ravine of Wady Kerkera. Terraces, once regulated by the hand of man and now overgrown with thick underwood, were formerly covered with dwelling-houses whose remains cumber the soil. The foundations of some are still visible. They were small, but tolerably well- built, with regular stones of fair dimensions. On the door, still standing, of one of them, we observe a cross with standing, equal arms set in a niche. Besides these, the ruins of a building measuring twenty-six paces long from west to east, and twenty from north to south, deserve particular attention. It was built with cut stones worked in with much care and without cement. The southern facade was pierced with these doors. Another door, the only one on that side, was constructed in the middle of the western facade; its lintel is lying on the ground. On the east was an apse, whose interior are in place. Within this ancient church are several monolithic columns half hidden by the bushes; they measure 2.50 metres in length, by thirty-five centimetres in diameter. The capitals and the base are wanting, or at all events no longer visible. By the side of this building is observed a sort of subterranean magazine arched in stone with a circular arch. It is partly filled up. On the sumrnit of the hill the vestiges of a town can be recognised. It was approached by a number of steps.'Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 150-151; as given by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 171 =British Mandate era= In the 1945 statistics, the village (including Arab al-Aramisha, Jurdayh and Khirbat Idmith) had a population of 360 Muslims. A total of 2,637 dunums of village land were used for cereals, and 16 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.Khalidi, 1992, p. 17Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. Kibbutz Adamit was founded in 1958 on village land, to the west of the village site. The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village site in 1992: \\"The site is covered with the debris of houses. It also has a number of wells and caves. The remains of animal shelters are located about away, and about to the east is the rubble of houses used by the Arab al-Qulaytat.\\"Khalidi, 1992, p. 18 Petersen inspected the place in 1991, and found that the remains of the village consisted of several widely spaced rectangular houses, one storey high. Most houses were made of rough field stones laid dry, but with traces of older coursed masonry in places.

Cartographer: Willem Janszoon Blaeu The Kola Peninsula (, '; from , '; ; ; ) is a peninsula in the far northwest of Russia. Constituting the bulk of the territory of Murmansk Oblast,2007 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, p. 2The area of the peninsula is ; vs. Murmansk Oblast's total area of . it lies almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast. The city of Murmansk is the most populous human settlement on the peninsula, with a population of over 300,000 as of the 2010 Census. While the north of the peninsula was already settled in the 7th‚Äì5th millennium BCE, the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE, when various peoples started to arrive from the south. However, by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained. This changed in the 12th century, when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula's game and fish riches. Soon after, the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. No permanent settlements, however, were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century. The Soviet period saw a rapid increase of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and the discovery of the vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline. Its population fell from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 795,000 in 2010. The peninsula has recovered somewhat in the early 21st century, and is considered the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. Despite the peninsula's northerly location, its proximity to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, but also results in high winds due to the temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea. Summers are rather chilly, with the average July temperature of only . The peninsula is covered by taiga in the south and tundra in the north, where permafrost limits the growth of the trees resulting in landscape dominated by shrubs and grasses. The peninsula supports a small variety of mammals, and its rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established to protect the population of common eider, is located in the Kandalaksha Gulf. Geography =Location and overview= The peninsula is located in the far northwest of Russia, almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast.1971 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, p. I Geologically, the peninsula occupies the northeastern edge of the Baltic Shield. The western border of the peninsula stretches along the meridian from the Kola Bay through the valley of the Kola River, Lake Imandra, and the Niva River to the Kandalaksha Gulf,Great Soviet Encyclopedia. –ö–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ–ª—É–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ although some sources push it all the way west to Russia's border with Finland.See, for example, Bartold, p. 14 Under a more restrictive definition, the peninsula covers an area of about . The northern coast is steep and high, while the southern coast is flat. The western part of the peninsula is covered by two mountain ranges: the Khibiny Mountains and the Lovozero Massif; the former contains the highest point of the peninsula‚ÄîMount Chasnachorr, the height of which is . The Keyvy drainage divide lies in the central part. The mountainous reliefs of the Murman and Kandalaksha Coasts stretch from southeast to northwest, mirroring the peninsula's main orographic features. Administratively, the territory of the peninsula consists of Lovozersky and Tersky Districts, parts of Kandalakshsky and Kolsky Districts, as well as the territories subordinated to the cities and towns of Murmansk, Ostrovnoy, Severomorsk, Kirovsk, and parts of the territories subordinated to Apatity, Olenegorsk, and Polyarnye Zori.2007 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 6‚Äì7 View of the Kola Peninsula near Murmansk =Natural resources= Because the last ice age removed the top sediment layer of the soil, the Kola Peninsula is on the surface extremely rich in various ores and minerals, including apatites and nephelines; copper, nickel, and iron ores; mica; kyanites; ceramic materials,1971 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, p. II. as well as rare-earth elements and non-ferrous ores. Deposits of construction materials such as granite, quartzite, and limestone are also abundant. Diatomaceous earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation. =Climate= The Khibiny Mountains have an Arctic-moderate climate Proximity of the peninsula to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80‚Äì120 days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.Field Precipitation levels on the peninsula are rather high: in the mountains, on the Murman Coast, and in other areas. The wettest months are August through October, while March and April are the driest. The average temperature in January is about , with lower temperatures typical in the central parts of the peninsula. The average temperature in July is about . Record lows reach in the central parts and on the coasts. Record highs exceed almost on all the territory of the peninsula. First frosts occur as early as August and may last through May and even June. Most areas of the Kola Peninsula are subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Dfc). The nearby islands usually belong to tundra (K√∂ppen climate classification: ET). =Flora and fauna= Ripe cloudberry An Arctic fox The peninsula is covered by taiga in the south and tundra in the north. In the tundra, cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and spruces. Reindeer herds visit the grasslands in summer. Other animals include red and Arctic foxes, wolverines, moose, otters, and lynx in the southern areas.1971 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, p. III American minks, which were released near the Olenitsa River in 1935‚Äì1936, are now common throughout the peninsula and are commercially hunted. Beavers, which became endangered by 1880, were re- introduced in 1934‚Äì1957. All in all, thirty-two species of mammals and up to two hundred bird species inhabit the peninsula. Beluga whales are the only cetacean being common around the peninsula. Other dolphins, including Atlantic white-sided dolphins, white-beaked dolphins, and harbor porpoises,ASCOBANS. 8th Advisory Committee Meeting. Report of the Nordic sub-Group on Research Priorities for ASCOBANS, Charlottenlund. February 14, 2001. as well as large whales, such as bowhead, humpback, blue, and finback, also visit the area. The coasts of the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Barents Sea are important breeding grounds for bearded seals and ringed seals. The Barents Sea is one of the only places the rare Gray seals can be found. Greenland seals, or harp seals, also can be seen from time to time. Twenty-nine species of fresh water fish are recognized on the territory of peninsula, including trout, stickleback, northern pike, and European perch. The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon, which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, with a number of remote lodges and camps available to host sport- fishermen.Richmond, p. 365 The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of common eider,Official website of the Kandalaksha Nature Reserve.

The most important of them are the Ponoy, the Varzuga, the Umba, the Teriberka, the Voronya, and the Yokanga. Most rivers originate from lakes and swamps and collect their waters from melting snow. The rivers become icebound during the winter, although the areas with strong rapids freeze later or not at all. Major lakes include Imandra, Umbozero, and Lovozero. There are no lakes with an area smaller than . Recreational fishery is developed in the region. = Ecology = The Kola Peninsula as a whole suffered major ecological damage, mostly as a result of pollution from the military (particularly naval) production, industrial mining of apatite, and military nuclear waste. About 137 active and 140 decommissioned or idle naval nuclear reactors, produced by the Soviet military, remain on the peninsula.Avenhaus et al, p. 247 For thirty years, nuclear waste had been dumped into the sea by the Northern Fleet and Murmansk Shipping Company. There is also evidence of contamination from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, with contaminants being found in the flesh of reindeer and other animals, and from the 1972 and 1984 controlled nuclear explosions northwest of Kirovsk.Ministry of Economic Development of Murmansk Oblast. ¬´–°—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏—è —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-—ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è –ú—É—Ä–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –¥–æ 2020 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –¥–æ 2025 –≥–æ–¥–∞¬ª (Socioeconomic Development Strategy of Murmansk Oblast Until 2020 and for the Period Until 2025) Additionally, several nuclear weapons test ranges and radioactive waste storage facilities exist on the peninsula.

V In the 3rd‚Äì2nd millennium BCE, the peninsula was settled by the peoples who arrived there from the south (the territory of modern Karelia). Bolshoy Oleny Island in the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea is the location of an important Bronze Age archaeological site where ancient DNA has been recovered.V.I. Khartanovich, V.G. Moiseev.

YANAO Scientific Research Center of the Arctic. November 19‚Äì23, 2017. Salekhard. By the end of the 1st millennium CE, the peninsula was settled only by the Sami people, who did not have their own state, lived in clans ruled by elders,Administrative-Territorial Divisions of Murmansk Oblast, p. 16 and were engaged mostly in reindeer herding and fishing.1971 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, p. IV In the 12th century, Russian Pomors from the shores of the Onega Bay and in the lower reaches of the Northern Dvina discovered the peninsula and its game and fish riches. The Pomors organized regular hunting and fishing visits and started barter trade with the Sami. They also called the White Sea coast of the peninsula Tersky Coast () or Terskaya Land (). By the end of the 12th century, the Pomors explored all northern coast of the peninsula and reached Finnmark (an area in the north of Norway), necessitating the Norwegians to support a naval guard in that area. The name given by the Pomors to the northern coast was Murman‚Äîa distorted form of Norman meaning \\"Norwegian\\". =Novgorodians= Pomors were soon followed by tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the Kola Peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. A 1265 treaty of Yaroslav Yaroslavich with Novgorod mentions Tre Volost (), which is later also mentioned in other documents dated as late as 1471. In addition to Tre, Novgorodian documents of the 13th‚Äì15th centuries also mention Kolo Volost, which bordered Tre approximately along the line between Kildin Island and Turiy Headland of the Turiy Peninsula. Kolo Volost lay to the west of that line, while Tre was situated to the east of it. By the 13th century, a need to formalize the border between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian countries became evident.Administrative-Territorial Divisions of Murmansk Oblast, p. 17 The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what now is Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Jacob's River, which now is a part of Norway. The Sami population was forced to pay tribute. The Norwegians, however, were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway. Also in 1251, the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections, making the Sami people pay tribute to both Novgorod and Norway. By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except in the eastern part of Tersky Coast. No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty. Map of Russian principalities in 1237 The treaty led to a short period of peace, but the armed conflicts resumed soon thereafter. Chronicles document attacks by the Novgorodians and the Karelians on Finnmark and northern Norway as early as 1271, and continuing well into the 14th century. The official border between the Novgorod lands and the lands of Sweden and Norway was established by the Treaty of N√∂teborg on August 12, 1323. The treaty primarily focused on the Karelian Isthmus border and the border north of Lake Ladoga. Another treaty dealing the matters of the northern borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark.Administrative-Territorial Divisions of Murmansk Oblast, p. 18 Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty did not address the situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920. In the 15th century, Novgorodians started to establish permanent settlements on the peninsula. Umba and Varzuga, the first documented permanent settlements of the Novgorodians, date back to 1466. Over time, all coastal areas to the west of the Pyalitsa River had been settled, creating a territory where the population was mostly Novgorodian. Administratively, this territory was divided into Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were governed by a posadnik from the area of the Northern Dvina. The Novgorod Republic lost control of both of these volosts to the Grand Duchy of Moscow after the Battle of Shelon in 1471, and the republic itself ceased to exist in 1478 when Ivan III took the city of Novgorod. All Novgorod territories, including those on the Kola Peninsula, became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The Novgorod Republic lost control of the peninsula to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1471, but the Russian migration did not stop. Several new settlements were established during the 16th century, and the Sami and Pomor people were forced into serfdom. In the second half of the 16th century, the peninsula became a subject of dispute between the Tsardom of Russia and the Kingdom of Denmark‚ÄìNorway, which resulted in the strengthening of the Russian position. By the end of the 19th century, the indigenous Sami population had been mostly forced north by the Russians as well as by newly arriving Izhma Komi and Kominized Nenets (so-called Yaran people), who migrated here to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands in the southeast of the White Sea. The original administrative and economic center of the area was Kola, situated at the estuary of the Kola River into the Kola Bay. However, in 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (now Murmansk) was founded and quickly became the largest city and port on the peninsula. =Russian settlement= Territory acquired by 1505 under Ivan III of Russia Russian migration to the peninsula continued into the 16th century, when new settlements such as Kandalaksha and Porya-Guba were established. Kola was first mentioned in 1565. In the end of the 15th century, the Pomors and the Sami people were forced into serfdom, mostly by the monasteries. Monastery votchinas greatly expanded during the 17th century, but were abolished in 1764, when all of the Kola Peninsula peasants became state peasants. In the second half of the 16th century, King Frederick II of Denmark‚ÄìNorway demanded that the Tsardom of Russia cede the peninsula. Russia declined, and in order to organize adequate defenses established the position of a voyevoda.Administrative-Territorial Divisions of Murmansk Oblast, p. 19 The voyevoda sat in Kola, which became the administrative center of the region. Prior to that, the administrative duties were performed by the tax collectors from Kandalaksha. Newly established Kolsky Uyezd covered most of the territory of the peninsula (with the exception of Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were a part of Dvinsky Uyezd), as well as the northern part of Karelia all the way to Lendery. Despite the economic activity, permanent settlement of the peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s and even then it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500 inhabitants living in 80 households, compared to 1,900 inhabitants in 300 households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication with the rest of Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in marginalization of the local Sami population.Robinson & Kassam, pp. 92‚Äì93 By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula. In 1894, the peninsula was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became convinced of the region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving the communication with the mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.Administrative-Territorial Divisions of Murmansk Oblast, p. 24 During World War I, the still poorly developed peninsula suddenly found itself in a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained the only means of sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na- Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula. =Soviet and modern periods= Norwegian settlement on the Kola, 1930s Soviet power was established on the territory of the peninsula on , 1917, but the territory was occupied by the forces of Russia's pre-war allies in March 1918‚ÄìMarch 1920.1971 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, p. VI Alexandrovsky Uyezd was transformed into Murmansk Governorate by the Soviet government in June 1921.Administrative-Territorial Divisions of Murmansk Oblast, p. 28 On August 1, 1927, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) issued two Resolutions: \\"On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast\\" and \\"On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast\\", according to which Murmansk Governorate was transformed into Murmansk Okrug (which was divided into six districts) and included into Leningrad Oblast. This arrangement existed until May 28, 1938, when the okrug was separated from Leningrad Oblast, merged with Kandalakshsky District of the Karelian ASSR, and transformed into modern Murmansk Oblast.Decree of May 28, 1938 All in all, the Soviet period saw a significant increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads and the sea coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding. In 1920‚Äì1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula. The Sami peoples were subject to forced collectivization, with more than half of their reindeer herds collectivized in 1928‚Äì1930. In addition, the traditional Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia. Those Sami resisting the collectivization were subject to forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd reindeer across much of the region. The Sami were not the only people subject to repressions. Thousands of people were sent to Kola in the 1930s‚Äì1950s, and in 2007 over two thousand people‚Äîdescendants of those forcibly sent here‚Äîstill live on the peninsula.RIA Novosti. A Monument to the Victims of Political Repressions Is Planned to Open in Murmansk by October 30 . September 26, 2007 A significant portion of the people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to dekulakization.Kola Encyclopedia. Kola Krai in 1920‚Äì1939 Prisoner labor was often used when building new factoriesRichmond, p. 354 and for manning those which were operational: in 1940, for example, the whole Severonikel Metallurgy Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system.Ivanova, p. 83 Demography Ethnic map of Kola Peninsula, 1941. –†–£–°–°–ö–ò–ï=Russians, –°–ê–ê–ú–ò=Sami Children in Murmansk, 2015 Until the 1800s, the Kola Peninsula was extremely sparsely populated, with only 5,200 inhabitants in 1858. In 1868 the Russian government created incentives for settlement and not only Russians but also Finns, Norwegians and Karelians moved to the peninsula. By the 1897 census 9,291 people were counted in the Kola uyezd; 63% Russian, 19% Sami, 11% Finnish and 3% Karelian. By 1913 about 13,000‚Äì15,000 people lived in the peninsula, mostly along the shores.Kozlov et al., p. 50 However, the discovery of the vast natural resource deposits and industrialization efforts led to an explosive population growth during the Soviet times. By 1970, the population of the peninsula was around 799,000. The trend reverted in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The population of the whole Murmansk Oblast went down from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 890,000 in 2002 to 795,000 in 2010. As of the 2010 Census, the population consisted mostly of Russians (89.0%), Ukrainians (4.8%), and Belarusians (1.7%). Other groups of note include Komi (~1,600 inhabitants), Sami (~1,600), and Karelians (~1,400). The indigenous Sami people are mostly concentrated in Lovozersky District. Economy =Historical background= During the 15th‚Äì16th centuries, the main occupations of the Tersky Coast population were Atlantic salmon fishing, seal hunting, and the extraction of salt from the sea water. The salt extraction in Kandalaksha and Kola was mostly carried out by the monasteries in Pechenga and Solovki, and for a long time remained the only \\"industry\\" on the peninsula.Natural Resources of the Kola Peninsula, pp. 14‚Äì16 By the mid-16th century, Atlantic cod fishing developed on the Murman Coast in the north. The 1560s saw a rapid growth of international trade, with the Russian merchants from different regions of the country arriving to the peninsula to trade with the merchants from Western Europe. In 1585, however, the trade was moved to Archangel, although the settlement of Kola was still permitted to trade locally produced goods. During the 17th century, the salt extraction activities gradually went into decline as the locally produced salt was uncompetitive with cheap salt produced in the Kama River regions. Extensive poaching also led to the significantly reduced outputs from pearl hunting. However, commercial deer herding became more popular, although its share in the economy remained negligible until the 19th century. By the end of the 17th century, the practice of seasonal fishing and hunting settlements in the north of the peninsula became very common. Peter the Great, recognizing the political and economical importance of the peninsula, promoted its industries and commerce; however, the region fell into neglect after St. Petersburg was founded in 1703 and most of the shipping trade shifted there. In 1732, large deposits of silver in native form were discovered on Medvezhy Island in the Kandalaksha Gulf and copper, silver, and gold deposits were found in the lower reaches of the Ponoy River. However, despite the efforts ongoing for the next two centuries, there was no commercial success. At the end of the 18th century, the local population learned the practice of peat production from the Norwegians and started using peat for heating. Timber cutting industry developed in the region at the end of the 19th century; mostly in Kovda and Umba. The Soviet era saw drastic industrialization and militarization of the peninsula. In 1925‚Äì1926, significant deposits of apatite were discovered in the Khibiny Mountains, and the first apatite batch was shipped only a few years later, in 1929. In 1930, sulfide deposits were discovered in the Moncha area; in 1932‚Äì1933 iron ore deposits were found near the upper streams of the Iona River; and in 1935, significant deposits of titanium ores were discovered in the area of modern Afrikanda. The collectivization efforts in the 1930s led to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s‚Äìearly 1970s.Costlow & Nelson, p. 125 By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, as well as by the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants. Fishing, being the traditional industry of the region, was always considered important, even though the volumes of production remained insignificant until the beginning of the 20th century.Kola Encyclopedia. Fishing Industry In the 1920s‚Äì1930s, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet was created and the fishing infrastructure started to develop intensively. By 1940, fishing accounted for 40% of the oblast's and for 80% of Murmansk's economy. During the Cold War, the peninsula served as the naval basing area for a large portion of the Soviet naval and air strategic forces, providing protection from and posing a threat to northern Norway.GlobalSecurity.org. Murmansk Oblast Also the ELF-transmitter ZEVS of the Russian Navy is situated there. =Modern economy= Murmansk Port After the economic slump of the 1990s, the economy of the oblast started to rebound during the first decade of the 2000s, although at a rate below the country's average. Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk OblastCharter of Murmansk Oblast, Article 8.1. and does not freeze in winter. Although the strategic importance of the Kola Peninsula has diminished since the Cold War, the peninsula nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world. Mining is the basis of the oblast's economy, and mining enterprises remain the principal employers in such monotowns as Apatity, Kirovsk, Zapolyarny, Nikel, and Monchegorsk.Kola Encyclopedia. Mining Industry . The Kola Mining and Metallurgical Company, a division of Norilsk Nickel, conducts nickel-, copper-, and platinum-group- metals-mining operations on the peninsula.Official website of Norilsk Nickel. About Norilsk Nickel. Other large mining companies include OAO Apatit, which is the largest producer of phosphates in Europe; OAO Olcon, one of the leading producers of iron ore concentrates in Russia; and OAO Kovdorsky GOK, an ore- mining and processing enterprise. The fishing industry, although still operating significantly below the Soviet level of production, remains profitable, supplying 20% of Russia's fish in 2006 and with the volume steadily growing in 2007‚Äì2010.Ministry of Economic Development of Murmansk Oblast. Fishing industry of Murmansk Oblast . Murmansk is a key base for three fishing fleets, including Russia's largest, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet. Fish breeding, especially of salmon and trout, is a growing industry.

With the economy of the oblast being mostly export-oriented, transportation plays an important role and accounts for 11% of the Gross Regional Product.Kola Encyclopedia. Transportation, Communications, Trade, Customs . On the Kola Peninsula, the transportation network includes ship transport, air transport, automotive transport, electrified public transport, and access to the railways mostly passing through the rest of Murmansk Oblast. The city of Murmansk is an important port on the Northern Sea Route. The largest airports are the Murmansk Airport, which handles international flights to Scandinavian countries, and the joint military-civilian Kirovsk-Apatity Airport located southeast of Apatity.

The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, cotton, beehives and/or goats and occasional revenues; a total of 1,691 ak√ße. 7/12 of the revenue went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 193Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. In Pierre Jacotin¬¥s map from 1799 the village was called Kabli.Karmon, 1960, p. 160 The place was well known for its springs, including Ayn Mafshuh, Ayn Fawwar, Ayn al-'Asal, and Ayn Kabri. The number of springs made al-Kabri the main supplier of water in the District of Acre. Ancient aqueducts supplied water from the springs to Acre, and two additional canals were built by Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar in 1800, and Sulayman Pasha al-Adil in 1814.Khalidi, 1992, p. 20Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 156 In 1875, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the village: > Many of the houses are built of good materials, which seem ancient.

After this, Sirhan and his family fled to Lebanon.Morris, 2004, p. 253 On the 27 March 1948, the Yehiam convoy bringing supplies to besieged Kibbutz Yehiam was ambushed while passing by al-Kabri and 46 Haganah members were killed.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 138Khalidi, 1992, p. 20.

Until 1949, it was an Arab village built over the ruins of ancient Kefar Hanania. Archaeological surveys indicate Kefar Hanania was founded in the Early Roman period, and was inhabited through the Byzantine period. It was resettled in the Middle Ages and the modern era. Kafr  øInƒÅn was captured by Israel during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war, when many of the villagers fled the fighting. Those few hundred who managed to remain or to return were subsequently transferred out of the village by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to the West Bank or to other Arab towns in the newly established Israel on three separate occasions in January and February 1949. A shrine for the Sheikh Abu Hajar Azraq and the remains of a small domed building are still standing, along with the remains of various burial sites of rabbis. Archaeological remains include cisterns and domestic wells which supplied the village with drinking water from nearby springs.

Late Roman-era pottery types of the kind made in Kafr 'Inan have been found all throughout the Galilee and the Golan.David Adan-Bayewitz, Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology, Bar-Ilan University, Question & Response - 2 December 2013 (Hebrew) =Early Muslim period= An Aramaic inscription initially dated to the 6th century, and recently redated to Umayyad (661-750) or Abbasid period (750-969 with intermissions after 878), was found on a kelila (a type of hanging lamp) found in the synagogue.Flood, 2001, p. 50. =Crusader to Mamluk period= Ya'akov ben Netan'el, who visited the village in the 12th century during the period of Crusader rule, writes about the ruins of a synagogue quarried into the hill. Potential references to the village include a mention of the \\"widow of Ben al-'Anani\\" in a 12th- century Genizah document and to Kfar Hanan in the 13th century.Leibner, 2009, p. 129 In 1211, Samuel ben Samson travelled from Tiberias and Kfar Hanania before stopping in Safed.Winter and Levanoni, 2004, p. 164. In the 14th century, another traveller transcribes the village's name as Kefar Hanin. =Ottoman period= In 1522, Jewish traveler Moses ben Mordecai Bassola found about 30 families of Musta'arabi Jews (Arabic-speaking Jews, as opposed to Spanish Jews) among the residents, most of whom of priestly stock, making it the fifth largest Jewish community in the country at the time, out of the eight places named by him.Braslavsky (1933), p. 20Moshe Hayyim Baruch (1826), pp. 15b-24bBen-Zevi (1943), p. 80Lissovsky (2007), p. 169 An Ottoman census taken two years later (1525) listed 14 Jewish families. It is during the rule of the Ottoman Empire that the form Kafr  øInƒÅn (Kafr 'Anan) first appears. The village is listed in the tax records of either 1549 or 1596, as forming part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira, part of Safad Sanjak, with 21 households and 8 bachelors; an estimated population of 259. All the villagers were Muslim. They paid taxes on goats, beehives and on its press, which was used either for olives or grapes; a total of 12,272 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 178. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 21Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as \\"K. Hanein\\".Karmon, 1960, p. 166 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as being built of stone and having 150-200 Muslim residents. The arable land in the village comprised gardens and olive trees.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.203, Also cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 21 A population list from about 1887 showed that Kafr 'Inan had 80 inhabitants; all Muslim.Schumacher, 1888, p. 174 =British Mandate period= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kufr Enan had a population of 179; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Acre, p. 36 increasing in the 1931 census to 264, still all Muslims, in a total of 47 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 100 In the 1945 statistics, Kafr 'Inan had 360 Muslim inhabitants, with a total of of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 1,740 dunums were used for the cultivation of cereals, 1,195 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards and most of these (1,145 dunums) were planted with olive trees,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 80 while 21 dunams were built-up (urban) area.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 130 The village houses, made of stone with mud mortar, were bunched close together and separated by semi-circular, narrow alleys. Many new houses were constructed during the last years of Mandatory Palestine. Springs and domestic wells supplied drinking water. Olives and grain were the main crops. Grain was grown in the nearby flat zones and valleys. =Israeli period= Capture, evacuation and land expropriation The village was captured on 30 October 1948 by the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Hiram and following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. However, according to Walid Khalidi, the villagers refused to leave like most of the population in the area. Morris reports that the Israeli authorities classified the village as \\"abandoned\\" but the villagers kept returning.Morris, 2004, pp. 516-17 In January 1949, the IDF expelled 54, and moved another 128 inhabitants from Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya to other villages in Israel.Morris, 2004, p. 517 On 4 February 1949, units of the 79th Battalion surrounded the two villages and expelled 45 people to the West Bank. The 200 villagers who had permits to stay, mostly old men, women and children, were transferred to Majd al Kurum. Yet again, the villagers returned. By mid-February 1949 there were about 100 back in the two villages, according to IDF sources. The two villages were again evacuated by the IDF. The expulsion of the villagers upset some members of Mapam, who condemned David Ben-Gurion and the army. However, a suggestion for a Knesset motion calling for the establishment of an inquiry to probe the expulsions of the villagers of Kafr 'Inan, Farradiyya and Al-Ghabisiyya, was apparently never brought to the Knesset plenum.Morris, 2004, p. 516, note 80, pp. 541-2 In 1950, Article 125 of the Defence regulation of 1945 was invoked in order to confiscate the land belonging to a number of Palestinian Arab villages in Galilee, among them Kafr 'Inan.Nazzal, 1978, p. 100. The other villages were Amqa, Al-Damun, Al-Birwa, Al-Ghabisiyya, Al-Ruways, Mi'ar, Kuwaykat, Al- Mansura, Safad, Kafr Bir'im, al-Majdal, Tiberias and Saffuriyya This law was also used to prevent the villagers from returning to their homes even by legal means.Nazzal, 1978, p. 101 Aftermath The modern Jewish village of Kfar Hananya was first planned to the south of the depopulated Kafr  øInƒÅn village in 1982, and was eventually established there in 1989 on village land (though not on the actual site of Kafr  øInƒÅn). Chazon, built in 1969 on the lands of Al-Mansura, Tiberias, and Parod, built in 1949 on the lands of Al-Farradiyya (District of Safad), are both close to the village site, but not on village land. In 1992, Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi found piles of stones, clusters of cacti, fig trees, the remains of a domed building on a slope facing the village and the small shrine of Shaykh Abu Hajar Azraq on an adjacent hill to the east. The land around the site is forested and planted with fruit trees by the settlement of Parod.\\"Khalidi, 1992, p. 21 Archaeology =Roman to Byzantine-period village= In 1933, Joseph Braslavsky was the first to identify the quarried synagogue in Kafr 'Inan, based on the testimony of a local Arab peasant.Braslavsky (1933b), pp. 18‚Äì22; See p. 20 in: (Hebrew)Zvi Ilan (1991), pp. 153‚Äì154 In 1989, the site was surveyed by Zvi Ilan. Adan-Bayewitz, of the Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at Bar Ilan University conducted archaeological research at the site from 1987 to 1988, and excavated a late Roman-era pottery kiln in 1992‚Äì1993, with a stone-paved approach.Leibner, 2009, p. 130Adan-Bayewitz (1992), p. 192 See also * List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus * Palestinian refugee * Present absentee Gallery File:Remains of Synagogue carved from rock, at Old Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan.jpgSynagogue carved into the rock at ancient Kefar Hananiah (later Kafr 'Inan) File:Synagogue wall carved from rock - at Kafr 'Inan.jpgSynagogue walls carved into the rock at ancient Kfar Hananya File:Remains of structure at Old Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan.jpgRuins of stone structure at ancient Kfar Hananya File:Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan - ancient wall.jpgAncient Kfar Hananya (at Kafr 'Inan) File:Field before the Mount of old Kefar Hananiah.jpgGreen fields below hill of Kafr 'Inan File:Ruin of Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan.jpgKafr 'Inan, ruins References Bibliography       * * [reprinted from earlier Livorno edition] ()   External links *Welcome To Kafr 'Inan *Kafr 'Inan, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 4: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Kufr 3naan from Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh *Tour of Kafr ‚ÄòInan, Saturday, 3.10.2009, by Umar Ighbariyyeh, from Zochrot Category:District of Acre Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:Talmud places Category:Ancient synagogues in the Land of Israel ","title":"Kafr 'Inan"},{"id":"267524","text":"Kuwaykat (), also spelled Kuweikat, Kweikat or Kuwaikat, was a Palestinian village located 9 km northeast of Acre. It was depopulated in 1948. History The old khan (caravansary) in Kuwaykat possibly dated to the Crusader period or an earlier date. According to historian Denys Pringle, the khan might have been part of the headquarters of Genoese estate in the village built in the 13th century. It consisted of a round barrel-vaulted building made of ashlar.Pringle, 1997, p. 64 In 1245, it was noted that western part of Kuwaykat was owned by the Church and Hospital of St Thomas the Martyr in Acre.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 301, No. 1135; Cited in Pringle, 2009, p. 163 =Ottoman era= French map of the area, in 1799. \\"Chiouwe chiateh\\" correspond to KuwaykatKarmon, 1960, p. 162 In the late Ottoman period, Kuwaykat was named Chiouwe chiateh on the French map Pierre Jacotin made of the area during Napoleon's invasion of 1799. In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin visited, and found the village surrounded with gardens planted with fig and olive trees, and with an ancient well. He further noted that the village was mentioned in Crusader sources.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 29 In 1881 Kuwaykat was described by the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine as being built of stone and situated at the foot of hills. The roughly 300 Muslim residents cultivated olives.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 147. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 22 In 1887, an elementary school was built in the village. In addition, the village had a mosque and a shrine for the Druze religious leader, Shaykh Aby Muhammad al-Qurayshi. A population list from about 1887 showed that Kiryet et Kuweikat had about 565 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 173 =British Mandate period= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kuaikat had a population of 604; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 36 increasing in the 1931 census to 789, still all Muslims, in a total of 163 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 101 In April 1938, during the Palestinian Arab revolt against the British Mandatory authorities which began in 1936, rebels planted a mine on the Yarka road between Kuwaykat and Kafr Yasif which blew up a passing British Army vehicle, killing nine soldiers (Arab version) or one Royal Ulster rifleman, with two other soldiers wounded (British archive version). The rebel leader of Kuwaykat, Fayyad Baytam, was approached by regional rebel commander Shaykh Amhad al-Tuba to plant the explosive, but Baytam refused, wary of the consequences Kuwaykat would suffer should the British attack the village. Al- Tuba and Ali Hammuda of Tarshiha placed the mine instead. Following the attack, British forces initially blamed the residents of nearby Kafr Yasif and set fire to the village, resulting in wide scale destruction. When one of Kafr Yasif's residents informed the British soldiers that the village was not involved and the rebels had come from Kuwaykat, the British proceeded to surround and attack that village. Some young men left their homes and entered the streets and were subsequently shot dead and the village mosque, where several men had taken shelter, was raided. The men inside were removed and then killed by British soldiers. Nine men were killed, including a resident of Sabalan. According to anthropologist Ted Swedenburg, the incident in Kuwaykat was \\"an example of bloodletting that are largely invisible from published Western or Israeli accounts of the revolt.\\" The British later denied that its soldiers were involved in the incident.Swedenburg, 2003, pp. 107-108. The names of those killed are Ali Baytam, Salih Sanunu, Muhammad Muhammad al- Husayn, Ali al-Safadi, Ali Husayn At'ut, Muhammad Khalil At'ut, Muhammad Salih Iskandar, Ahmad al-'Abaday and unnamed person from Sabalan. In the 1945 statistics, Kuwaykat had 1,050 Muslim inhabitants, with a total of of land according to an official land and population survey. The land of Kuwaykat was considered to be among the most fertile of the district. Grain, olives and watermelons were its chief crops. In 1944/45 a total of 3,316 dunums were used for cereals, and 1,246 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, of which 500 dunums were planted with olive trees,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 131 The villagers also engaged in livestock breeding and dairy production. The village had a population of 1,050. =1948 War and aftermath= Tombstone in the graveyard in Kuwaykat, 2019 The first attack on the village of Kuwaykat during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War took place on 18‚Äì19 January 1948, and involved a force of over eighty Jewish militiamen, according to Filastin, the Palestinian newspaper at the time. The attack was repulsed, as was another attack on the village on the night of 6‚Äì7 February.Filastin, 21.01.1948 and 08.02.1948 The village was finally depopulated during a military assault by Israel's Sheva' Brigade and Carmeli Brigade, as part of Operation Dekel. On the night of 9 July, at the start of the offensive, the village came under heavy bombardment. Villagers interviewed in 1973 in the refugee camp of Bourj el-Barajneh in Lebanon recalled: > We were awakened by the loudest noise we had ever heard, shells exploding > and artillery fire [..] women were screaming, children were crying...Most of > the villagers began to flee with their pajamas on. The wife of Qassim Ahmad > Sa¬¥id fled carrying a pillow in her arms instead of her child ...Nazzal, > 1978, pp. 72-73 Two people were killed and two wounded by the shelling. Many villagers fled to Abu Snan, Kafr Yasif and other villages that later surrendered. Those, mostly elderly, villagers who remained in Kuwaykat, were soon expelled to Kafr Yasif. In January 1949, kibbutz ha-Bonim (later renamed Beit HaEmek) was established near the site of Kuwaykat, on village lands.Morris, 1987, p. 187 Its settlers were Jewish immigrants from England, Hungary and the Netherlands. The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village in 1992: > Little remains of the village except the deserted cemetery, completely > overgrown with weeds, and rubble from houses. Inscriptions on two of the > graves identify one as that of Hamad 'Isa al-Hajj, and another as that of > Shaykh Salih Iskandar, who died in 1940.

The shrine is a handsome, domed structure, the front wall and arched entrance of which are framed by prominent stone pillars. The mosque, a stone structure with a dome and vaulted ceilings, has been turned into a private home for a Jewish family. The former Islamic school for orphans is also inhabited. The cemetery is still visible but is not tended; it contains a tombstone that is inscribed in Turkish and dates to the eighteenth century.

In the Crusader era, it was mentioned in 1277 under the name of Somelaria.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, pp. 366-367, No. 1413; cited in Pringle, 1998, pp. 332-333 At the time, the village belonged to the Templars.Pringle, 1997, p. 96 In the hudna of 1283 between Al Mansur Qalawun and the Crusaders, Al-Sumayriyya was still under Crusader ruleRaynaud, 1887, p. 243, no. 490Barag, 1979, p. 205, no. 26 while in 1291 it had come under Mamluk control.Raynaud, 1887, p. 243, no. 490; cited in Pringle, 1998, pp. 332-333 A building with a court-yard, measuring 60,5 by 57 meters, dating from the Crusader era, has been noted in the village, and a 13th-century glass- factory has been excavated. =Ottoman era= It was mentioned in the Ottoman defter for the year 1555-6, named Summayriyah, located in the Nahiya of Akka of the Liwa of Safad, and with its land designated as Sahi land, that is, land belonging to the Sultan.Rohde, 1979, p. 97 In 1738 Richard Pococke passed by the place, which he called Semmars. He thought the name came from \\"St. Mary's\\", and noted the remains of a wall of hewn stone, which he thought had belonged to a convent.Pococke, 1745, vol II, p. 78; referenced in Pringle, 1997, p. 96 A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as El Esmerieh.Karmon, 1960, p. 162. In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin found the village had 400 Muslim inhabitants.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 161 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the place as a village of \\"mud and stone houses, containing about 200 [..] Moslems, situated on the plain, surrounded by a few clumps of olives and figs and arable land; two or three cisterns are in the village, the aqueduct near brings good water.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 147. Also cited in Khalidi, 1992, p.30 A population list from about 1887 showed the village to have about 270 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 172 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities Semariyeh had a population of 307; 300 Muslims and 7 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Acre, p. 36 where all the Christians were Maronite.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 49 This had increased in the 1931 census to 392, 390 Muslims, 1 Christian and 1 Jew, in a total of 92 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 103 Al-Sumayriyya had an elementary school for boys, which was founded in 1943. In 1945, it had an enrollment of 60 students. One mosque which remains.Khalidi, 1992, p. 30 In 1944/1945 the village had a population of 760 Muslims, with a total of 8,542 dunams of land. Of this, 6,854 dunams were allocated to grain crops; 354 dunams were irrigated or planted with orchards,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 131 =1948, and aftermath= At the beginning of 1945, al-Sumayriyya's 760 inhabitants were all Arab Muslims. The inhabitants fled as a result of the 14 May 1948 assault on the village by the Carmeli Brigade during Operation Ben-Ami, one day before the official outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The village - along with neighbouring al-Bassa and al-Zib which were also captured in the offensive - was subsequently destroyed, except its mosque.Tal, 2004, pp. 104-105. Lohamei HaGeta'ot and Shomrat are both on village land. Morris writes that Bustan HaGalil was built near its site,Morris, 2004, p.xxi, settlement #36. December 1948 however, Khalidi writes that Bustan HaGalil is on the land of Al-Manshiyya.Khalidi, 1992, p.23 Shavey Tziyon and Regba are close to the northern borders of Al-Sumayriyya, but were established on land that used to belong to Mazra'a.

Hong Kong's climate is seasonal due to alternating wind direction between winter and summer. Hong Kong has been geologically stable for millions of years. Flora and fauna in Hong Kong are altered by climatic change, sea level alternation, and human impact. Climate Hong Kong's climate is subtropical but half the year is temperate. The territory is situated South of the tropic of Cancer which is equal to Hawaii in latitude. In winter, strong and cold wind generates from the North to Hong Kong; in summer, the wind reverses in direction and brings the warm and humid air from the South. This climate would support a tropical rainforest. The map shows the latitude of Hong Kong compared to the major cities in the rest of China and the Asia Pacific area. It can be seen that the latitude of Hong Kong is the same as that of Honolulu (on the right side of the map). Land The total land area of Hong Kong is 1,076 square kilometers, but about 75% of this land is open countryside, which contains more than 2600 species of vascular plants, about 450 species of birds, about 200 species of butterflies, about 100 species of dragonflies, 40 species of mammals, 80 species of reptiles and more than 20 species of amphibians, including some species endemic to the territory. Species richness in Hong Kong Hong Kong is considered rich in number of species. The number of species of birds in Hong Kong is one third of that in China while the number of butterflies species is also one sixth of the total butterfly species in China according to surveys reported.Ecology of Hong Kong , Hong Kong Nature.net Ecosystems in Hong Kong =Mangroves= Mangroves are habitats of enclosed intertidal mud flats with wave action greatly reduced, located near sources of fresh water. Popular mangrove habitats in Hong Kong are located along Deep Bay, such as Pak Nai and Tsim Bei Tsui, where salinity is very low under the influence of fresh water from the Pearl River, and along some mud flats where salinity is lowered by surrounding streams, such as Three Fathoms Cove and Ting Kok. Trees living in this habitat are called mangrove trees. The following are the sites of mangroves in Hong Kong: *Deep Bay *Tolo Harbour *Hoi Ha Wan *Long Harbour *Hebe Haven *Tai O *Tung Chung *Tai Tam Harbour *Pui O * Kei Ling Ha =Rocky shores= The tidal range of Hong Kong is about 2.5 meters and the distribution of species situated into this area must be tolerant of both conditions that the shores are covered with sea water during high tide and the shores are exposed to the air directly during low tide, for hours or days. Species which have adapted to these different conditions are described as specialized to successfully exploit narrow vertical zones on the rocky shore. The species inhabiting Hong Kong rocky shores varies in accordance with the exposure to the wave action from the sea. The sessile filter-feeding organisms inhabit the wave exposed shores. They are able to attach on the rock surface and remove food particles in the turbulent water while the mobile herbivores and carnivores inhabit in the sheltered shores. The varieties of the organisms also different from seasons, especially in Hong Kong where oceanic currents change with season: very few erect foliose macro-algae are found in summer because they may suffer from the burning heat; a lot of foliose algae are found on the shores in winter. The following are the sites of rocky shores in Hong Kong: *Luk Keng *Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai *Cape D'Aguilar Marine Reserve =Streams= There are two kinds of freshwater habitats: lentic water, such as lakes, ponds, ditches, and lotic water, such as rivers, streams. Streams are an example of a lotic habitat Hong Kong. There are three main factors to differentiate the habitats in Hong Kong: variability of current, amount of detritus and variable oxygen content. These factors contribute to make the animals adapted in different ways. They have to attach themselves to the surfaces, become predominantly detritus feeders and have a mechanism for obtaining maximum oxygen supply. The following are the list of rivers in Hong Kong: *Wa Mei Shan *Lam Tsuen River *Shing Mun River =Sandy shores= The following are the site of sandy shores in Hong Kong: *Starfish Bay Problems =Pollution= General Chinese white dolphin Black-faced spoonbill In 1989, the Hong Kong government realised that Hong Kong was in danger of becoming a vast, densely populated city. Due to the growth of the economy and business sectors, the water, waste and air pollution cause an adverse effect on the balance of ecology in Hong Kong. Factories, farms and restaurants in the New Territories dump large amounts of sewage and even untreated waste into the streams and the sea. It makes the New Territories' streams be 'no better than open sewers'. This severe damage is irreversible and the creatures in the sea are the direct victims. The pink dolphin is one of the victims. Under threat from chemical pollution, increased sea traffic and the destruction of much of the natural shoreline for land reclamation, the number of pink dolphins has dramatically declined as the city continues to develop. The nature reserve and birds in Mai Po Marsh are the other victims. They are threatened by the pig sewage flooding as well as the increased pollution from Shenzhen. Yet according to World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong the number of the endangered black-faced spoonbills wintering in Mai Po has risen from roughly 35 in the late 1980s to 152 after 10 years. About 400 are spotted after 2000. Estimates on how many of these birds remain in the wild vary from 2,000 to 1,000. The oyster farms have been throttled by a mixture of pollution and competition from cheaper oyster cultivation across the border in China. Air pollution Air pollution is another serious problem. Smoke-belching factories, ceaseless construction and large numbers of diesel vehicles have made for dangerous levels of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Not only the flora and fauna are affected but also humans. Cases of asthma and bronchial infections have soared in recent years, and doctors place the blame squarely on poor air quality. Thermal pollution According to a Baptist University study, daily average minimum temperatures have increased by 0.02 degrees (Celsius) annually between 1965 and 2003, due to the \\"concrete jungle\\" which traps heat during the daytime and releases it at night. Average daily maximum temperatures have fallen by 0.014 degrees each year, as air pollution is blocking solar radiation. Resulting increased night time ambient temperatures incite families to use domestic air- conditioning, which further compounds the problem.Agnes Lam, \\"Nighttime temperatures creeping ever higher\\", Page C1, South China Morning Post, 7 June 2007 Research has shown that the ambient air-temperature in urban areas can be some 5 ¬∞C higher than non built-up areas. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University commissioned NASA to take a high-resolution thermal image of urban Hong Kong by satellite at 22:40 on 4 August 2007, which showed at least a 4 degree difference between the coolest areas and the \\"urban heat islands\\". The variations are attributable to greater absorbency of man-made materials, and building density which restrict air-flow. The urban heat island had expanded into Hung Hom since January, when the first image was taken.10.40pm, 32¬∞. The future's red hot for HK, pg 1, South China Morning Post, 30 September 2007 \\"Wall effect\\" Highly-dense buildings can be seen in Tseung Kwan O. There has been increasing concern since 2006 over the \\"wall effect\\" caused by uniform high-rise developments which adversely impact air circulation. Due to the density of Hong Kong's population and the economies of scale of mass developments, there is the tendency of new private tower block developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30 to 70 stories high. Developers of housing estates are financially motivated to maximize the view, at the expense of the free flow of air. Huge wall-like estates along the waterfront are often constructed. In-fill developments will tend to be done by smaller developers with less capital. These will be smaller in scale, and less prone to the wall effect. Environmental group Green Sense expressed concern that their survey on 155 housing estates found 104 have a 'wall-like' design. It cited estates in Tai Kok Tsui and Tseung Kwan O as the \\"best examples\\". In May 2007, citing concern over developments in West Kowloon, and near Tai Wai and Yuen Long railway stations, some legislators called for a law to stop developers from constructing tall buildings which adversely affect air flow in densely populated areas, but the bid failed.Olga Wong, \\"Call for law against 'wall effect' fails\\", South China Morning Post, 10 May 2007 In 2007, residents of Tai Kok Tsui, increasingly aware of the problem, have been lobbying against further proliferation of such high-rises in their area which threaten the last air corridor. =Threats to flora and fauna= Destruction of habitat *Encroachment of the green belt *Effect of the Building Waste Levy Illegal hunting of species by mainland Chinese With increasing affluence of mainland Chinese, some of them become affable to some luxury flora and fauna, like Podocarpus macrophyllus (; Cantonese: lo hon chung) and Cuora trifasciata (; Cantonese: kam chin kwai). Some luxury species are becoming increasingly rare in South China due to increased hunting, and hunters turn to the last habitat in the area: Hong Kong. Introduction of non-indigenous species Most of the introduced species do little harm to the ecology of Hong Kong. However, some species are invasive and cause massive damage to the ecology and/or economy of Hong Kong. For example, the pinewood nematode from North America and pine-needle scale insect from Taiwan, which together virtually eliminated the native Pinus massoniana in the 1970s and 1980s.

Near this tower a few old houses served as an asylum to four families of Metawileh. On the lintel of the door of one of these houses a square cross inscribed in a circle can still be traced. The terraces of another house are supported in the interior by arched arcades in good cut stone of Roman, or at least Byzantine, date.

It has been used in many U.S. space projects since 1973 and its most significant use was in the Space Shuttle program (approximately 85% of the Shuttle software is coded in HAL/S). It was designed by Intermetrics in 1972 for NASA and delivered in 1973. HAL/S is written in XPL, a dialect of PL/I. Although HAL/S is designed primarily for programming on-board computers, it is general enough to meet nearly all the needs in the production, verification, and support of aerospace and other real-time applications. According to documentation from 2005, it is been maintained by the HAL/S project of United Space Alliance. Goals and principles The three key principles in designing the language were reliability, efficiency, and machine-independence. The language is designed to allow aerospace-related tasks (such as vector/matrix arithmetic) to be accomplished in a way that is easily understandable by people who have spaceflight knowledge, but may not necessarily have proficiency with computer programming. HAL/S was designed not to include some constructs that were thought to be the cause of errors. For instance, there is no support for dynamic memory allocation. The language provides special support for real-time execution environments. Some features, such as \\"GOTO\\" were provided chiefly to ease mechanical translations from other languages. (page 82) \\"HAL\\" was suggested as the name of the new language by Ed Copps, a founding director of Intermetrics, to honor Hal Laning, a colleague at MIT. On the Preface page of the HAL/S Language Specification, it says, :fundamental contributions to the concept and implementation of MAC were made by Dr. J. Halcombe Laning of the Draper Laboratory. A proposal for a NASA standard ground-based version of HAL named HAL/G for \\"ground\\" was proposed, but the coming emergence of the soon to be named Ada programming language contributed to Intermetrics' lack of interest in continuing this work. Instead, Intermetrics would place emphasis on what would be the \\"Red\\" finalist which would not be selected. Host compiler systems have been implemented on an IBM 360/370, Data General Eclipse, and the Modcomp IV/Classic computers. Target computer systems have included IBM 360/370, IBM AP-101 (space shuttle avionics computer), Sperry 1819A/1819B, Data General Nova and Eclipse, CII Mitra 125, Modcomp II and IV, NASA Std. Spacecraft Computer-l and Computer-2, ITEK ATAC 16M (Galileo Project), and since 1978 the RCA CDP1802 COSMAC microprocessor (Galileo Project and others). Syntax HAL/S is a mostly free-form language: statements may begin anywhere on a line and may spill over the next lines, and multiple statements may be fitted onto the same line if required. However, non-space characters in the first column of a program line may have special significance. For instance, the letter 'C' in the first column indicates that the whole line is a comment and should be ignored by the compiler. One particularly interesting feature of HAL/S is that it supports, in addition to a normal single line text format, an optional three-line input format in which three source code lines are used for each statement. In this format, the first and third lines are usable for superscripts (exponents) and subscripts (indices). The multi-line format was designed to permit writing of HAL/S code that is similar to mathematical notation. As an example, the statement x = a^2 + b_i^2 could be written in single-line format as: X = A ** 2 + B$(I) ** 2 Exponentiation is denoted by two asterisks, as in PL/I and Fortran. The subscript i is denoted by a dollar sign,with the subscript expression enclosed in parentheses. The same code fragment could be written in multiple-line format as: E 2 2 M X = A + B S I In the example, the base line of the statement is indicated by an 'M' in the first column, the exponent line is indicated by an 'E', and the subscript line is indicated by an 'S'. Example The following is a simple HAL/S program. Every program begins with a labeled \`PROGRAM\` statement; the label consists of an identifier followed by a colon. All variables must be declared in the \`DECLARE\` group, which precedes any executable statements. Every program ends with a \`CLOSE\` delimiting statement. SIMPLE: PROGRAM; C CODE IN THIS TYPEFACE IS C HAL/S SOURCE DECLARE PI CONSTANT (3.14159266); DECLARE R SCALAR; READ(5) R; WRITE(6) PI R**2; CLOSE SIMPLE; Data types HAL/S has native support for integers, floating point scalars, vector, matrices, booleans and strings of 8-bit characters, limited to a maximum length of 255. Structured types may be composed using a \`DECLARE STRUCT\` statement.

He described it: \\"Below the village extend fresh and verdant gardens where the water flows and murmurs incessantly in little canals, and where lofty poplars and great nut-trees, which recall Europe, mingle with the trees of Palestine. Near here is a mill, worked by water falling from a higher basin, which acts as a reservoir for a spring as abundant as that of Ras el 'Ain. After leaving the mill, the water forms a stream which fertilises the adjacent orchards. This raised and broad reservoir, whence the water escapes by an opening made for the purpose in the edge of the reservoir, is of modern construction, as is shown by the stones; but its first building must be ancient, because it is difficult to believe that the ancients should have neglected to get all the advantage possible from so important a spring.\\"Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 31-32, as translated by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 148 In 1881 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as \\"A stone and adobe village, containing about 200 Moslems, with figs, olive, pomegranate, and mulberry trees and gardens; there are two streams of water at this village.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 148 The layout of the village was rectangular.

One stone house still stands but its facade is missing and it is about to crumble. Cactuses and fig trees grow on the southern slopes of the site. There are four identifiable Roman and Byzantine tombs in the cemetery that lies on the northern slopes, a Christ-thorn tree stands in its midst. Recent excavations has uncovered several ancient graves, and the place has been turned into an archaeological site.\\" In 1993, when A.

Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included alchemy and chemistry, botany and agronomy, geography and cartography, ophthalmology, pharmacology, physics, and zoology. Medieval Islamic science had practical purposes as well as the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the Qibla, the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of Ibn Bassal and Ibn al-'Awwam, and geography enabled Abu Zayd al-Balkhi to make accurate maps. Islamic mathematicians such as Al-Khwarizmi, Avicenna and Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´ made advances in algebra, trigonometry, geometry and Arabic numerals. Islamic doctors described diseases like smallpox and measles, and challenged classical Greek medical theory. Al-Biruni, Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of drugs made from medicinal plants and chemical compounds. Islamic physicists such as Ibn Al-Haytham, Al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ and others studied optics and mechanics as well as astronomy, criticised Aristotle's view of motion. The significance of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to medieval Europe. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished across a wide area around the Mediterranean and further afield, for several centuries, in a wide range of institutions. Context Islamic expansion: The Abbasid Caliphate, 750‚Äì1261 (and later in Egypt) at its height, c. 850 The Islamic era began in 622. Islamic armies conquered Arabia, Egypt and Mesopotamia, eventually displacing the Persian and Byzantine Empires from the region. Within a century, Islam had reached the area of present-day Portugal in the west and Central Asia in the east. The Islamic Golden Age (roughly between 786 and 1258) spanned the period of the Abbasid Caliphate (750‚Äì1258), with stable political structures and flourishing trade. Major religious and cultural works of the Islamic empire were translated into Arabic and occasionally Persian. Islamic culture inherited Greek, Indic, Assyrian and Persian influences. A new common civilisation formed, based on Islam. An era of high culture and innovation ensued, with rapid growth in population and cities. The Arab Agricultural Revolution in the countryside brought more crops and improved agricultural technology, especially irrigation. This supported the larger population and enabled culture to flourish.McClellan and Dorn 2006, pp.103‚Äì115 From the 9th century onwards, scholars such as Al-Kindi translated Indian, Assyrian, Sasanian (Persian) and Greek knowledge, including the works of Aristotle, into Arabic. These translations supported advances by scientists across the Islamic world. Islamic science survived the initial Christian reconquest of Spain, including the fall of Seville in 1248, as work continued in the eastern centres (such as in Persia). After the completion of the Spanish reconquest in 1492, the Islamic world went into an economic and cultural decline. The Abbasid caliphate was followed by the Ottoman Empire ( 1299‚Äì1922), centred in Turkey, and the Safavid Empire (1501‚Äì1736), centred in Persia, where work in the arts and sciences continued.Turner 1997, p.7 Fields of inquiry Medieval Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included physics, alchemy and chemistry, ophthalmology, and geography and cartography.Turner 1997, Table of contents = Alchemy and chemistry = Alchemy, already well established before the rise of Islam, stemmed from the belief that substances comprised mixtures of the four Aristotelian elements (fire, earth, air, and water) in different proportions. Alchemists regarded gold as the noblest metal, and held that other metals formed a hierarchical series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the elixir, could transform a base metal into gold. Jabir ibn Hayyan (8th‚Äì9th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue in use when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances, including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as sublimation, reduction and distillation. He made use of equipment such as the alembic and the retort stand.Masood 2009, pp.153‚Äì155Turner 1997, pp.189‚Äì194. = Astronomy and cosmology = al-Biruni's explanation of the phases of the moon Astronomy became a major discipline within Islamic science. Astronomers devoted effort both towards understanding the nature of the cosmos and to practical purposes. One application involved determining the Qibla, the direction to face during prayer. Another was astrology, predicting events affecting human life and selecting suitable times for actions such as going to war or founding a city.Turner 1997, pp.59‚Äì116 Al-Battani (850‚Äì922) accurately determined the length of the solar year. He contributed to the Tables of Toledo, used by astronomers to predict the movements of the sun, moon and planets across the sky. Copernicus (1473-1543) later used some of Al-Battani's astronomic tables.Masood 2009, pp.74, 148‚Äì150 Al-Zarqali (1028‚Äì1087) developed a more accurate astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo, discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motionLinton (2004), p.97). Owing to the unreliability of the data al-Zarqali relied on for this estimate, its remarkable accuracy was fortuitous. for its rate of change.Masood 2009, pp.73‚Äì75 Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201‚Äì1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's 2nd-century celestial model. When Tusi became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.Masood 2009, pp.132‚Äì135 = Botany and agronomy= Quince, cypress, and sumac trees, in Zakariya al-Qazwini's 13th century Wonders of Creation The study of the natural world extended to a detailed examination of plants. The work done proved directly useful in the unprecedented growth of pharmacology across the Islamic world. Al-Dinawari (815‚Äì896) popularised botany in the Islamic world with his six-volume Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants). Only volumes 3 and 5 have survived, with part of volume 6 reconstructed from quoted passages. The surviving text describes 637 plants in alphabetical order from the letters sin to ya, so the whole book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. The thirteenth century encyclopedia compiled by Zakariya al-Qazwini (1203‚Äì1283) ‚Äì  øAjƒÅ'ib al-makhl≈´qƒÅt (The Wonders of Creation) ‚Äì contained, among many other topics, both realistic botany and fantastic accounts. For example, he described trees which grew birds on their twigs in place of leaves, but which could only be found in the far-distant British Isles., in Morelon & Rashed 1996, pp.813‚Äì852Turner 1997, pp.138‚Äì139Turner 1997, pp.162‚Äì188 The use and cultivation of plants was documented in the 11th century by Muhammad bin IbrƒÅhƒ´m Ibn BassƒÅl of Toledo in his book Dƒ´wƒÅn al- filƒÅha (The Court of Agriculture), and by Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbƒ´lƒ´ (also called Ab≈´ l-Khayr al-Ishbƒ´lƒ´) of Seville in his 12th century book KitƒÅb al- FilƒÅha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn BassƒÅl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy that fed into the Arab Agricultural Revolution. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them. It covered leaf- and root-vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. = Geography and cartography = first World Map of Piri Reis (1513) The spread of Islam across Western Asia and North Africa encouraged an unprecedented growth in trade and travel by land and sea as far away as Southeast Asia, China, much of Africa, Scandinavia and even Iceland. Geographers worked to compile increasingly accurate maps of the known world, starting from many existing but fragmentary sources.Turner 1997, pp.117‚Äì130 Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (850‚Äì934), founder of the Balkhƒ´ school of cartography in Baghdad, wrote an atlas called Figures of the Regions (Suwar al-aqalim). Al-Biruni (973‚Äì1048) measured the radius of the earth using a new method. It involved observing the height of a mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100‚Äì1166) drew a map of the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily (ruled 1105-1154). He also wrote the Tabula Rogeriana (Book of Roger), a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time.Masood 2009, pp.79‚Äì80 The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis ( 1470‚Äì1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He represented a part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.Turner 1997, pp.128‚Äì129 File:TabulaRogeriana upside- down.jpg Modern copy of al-Idrisi's 1154 Tabula Rogeriana, upside-down, north at top = Mathematics = al-Khwarizmi's Algebra Islamic mathematicians gathered, organised and clarified the mathematics they inherited from ancient Egypt, Greece, India, Mesopotamia and Persia, and went on to make innovations of their own. Islamic mathematics covered algebra, geometry and arithmetic. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate (founded 750), soon after the foundation of Baghdad in 762, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated by al-Mansur's group of scientists from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary trigonometrical techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as Ptolemy's Almagest and Euclid's Elements were translated into Arabic. By the second half of the ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were already making contributions to the most sophisticated parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries. Most medieval Islamic mathematicians wrote in Arabic, others in Persian.Turner 1997, pp.43‚Äì61 Omar Khayyam's \\"Cubic equation and intersection of conic sections\\" Al-Khwarizmi (8th‚Äì9th centuries) was instrumental in the adoption of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system and the development of algebra, introduced methods of simplifying equations, and used Euclidean geometry in his proofs.

New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. .Masood 2009, pp.139‚Äì145 He was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline in its own right,, page 263‚Äì277: \\"In a sense, al- Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called \\"the father of algebra\\" than Diophantus because al-Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers\\". and presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations.Maher, P. (1998). From Al-Jabr to Algebra. Mathematics in School, 27(4), 14‚Äì15. Ibn Ishaq al-Kindi (801‚Äì873) worked on cryptography for the Abbasid Caliphate,Masood 2009, pp.49‚Äì52 and gave the first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis and the first description of the method of frequency analysis. Avicenna ( 980‚Äì1037) contributed to mathematical techniques such as casting out nines.Masood 2009, pp.104‚Äì105 ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra (835‚Äì901) calculated the solution to a chessboard problem involving an exponential series.Masood 2009, pp.48‚Äì49 Al-Farabi ( 870‚Äì950) attempted to describe, geometrically, the repeating patterns popular in Islamic decorative motifs in his book Spiritual Crafts and Natural Secrets in the Details of Geometrical Figures.Masood 2009, pp.148‚Äì149 Omar Khayyam (1048‚Äì1131), known in the West as a poet, calculated the length of the year to within 5 decimal places, and found geometric solutions to all 13 forms of cubic equations, developing some quadratic equations still in use.Masood 2009, pp.5, 104, 145‚Äì146 Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´ ( 1380‚Äì1429) is credited with several theorems of trigonometry, including the law of cosines, also known as Al-Kashi's Theorem. He has been credited with the invention of decimal fractions, and with a method like Horner's to calculate roots. He calculated œÄ correctly to 17 significant figures.O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \\"Ghiyath al-Din Jamshid Mas'ud al-Kashi\\", MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, University of St Andrews. Sometime around the seventh century, Islamic scholars adopted the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, describing their use in a standard type of text fƒ´ l-·∏•isƒÅb al hindƒ´, (On the numbers of the Indians). A distinctive Western Arabic variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals began to emerge around the 10th century in the Maghreb and Al-Andalus (sometimes called ghubar numerals, though the term is not always accepted), which are the direct ancestor of the modern Arabic numerals used throughout the world. = Medicine = Mansur's Anatomy, 1450 Islamic society paid careful attention to medicine, following a hadith enjoining the preservation of good health. Its physicians inherited knowledge and traditional medical beliefs from the civilisations of classical Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia and India. These included the writings of Hippocrates such as on the theory of the four humours, and the theories of Galen.Turner 1997, pp.131‚Äì161 al-Razi ( 854‚Äì925/935) identified smallpox and measles, and recognized fever as a part of the body's defenses. He wrote a 23-volume compendium of Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes. He challenged Galen's work on several fronts, including the treatment of bloodletting, arguing that it was effective.Masood 2009, pp.74, 99‚Äì105 al-Zahrawi (936‚Äì1013) was a surgeon whose most important surviving work is referred to as al-Tasrif (Medical Knowledge). It is a 30-volume set mainly discussing medical symptoms, treatments, and pharmacology. The last volume, on surgery, describes surgical instruments, supplies, and pioneering procedures.Masood 2009, pp.108‚Äì109 Avicenna ( 980‚Äì1037) wrote the major medical textbook, The Canon of Medicine. Ibn al-Nafis (1213‚Äì1288) wrote an influential book on medicine; it largely replaced Avicenna's Canon in the Islamic world. He wrote commentaries on Galen and on Avicenna's works. One of these commentaries, discovered in 1924, described the circulation of blood through the lungs.Masood 2009, pp.110‚Äì111Turner 1997, pp.131‚Äì139 = Optics and ophthalmology = The eye according to Hunayn ibn Ishaq, 1200 Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), (965‚Äì1039 Iraq). A polymath, considered to be the father of modern scientific methodology due to his emphasis on experimental data and on the reproducibility of its results. Optics developed rapidly in this period. By the ninth century, there were works on physiological, geometrical and physical optics. Topics covered included mirror reflection. Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809‚Äì873) wrote the book Ten Treatises on the Eye; this remained influential in the West until the 17th century.Masood 2009, pp.47‚Äì48, 59, 96‚Äì97, 171‚Äì72 Abbas ibn Firnas (810‚Äì887) developed lenses for magnification and the improvement of vision.Masood 2009, pp.71‚Äì73 Ibn Sahl ( 940‚Äì1000) discovered the law of refraction known as Snell's law. He used the law to produce the first Aspheric lenses that focused light without geometric aberrations.K. B. Wolf, \\"Geometry and dynamics in refracting systems\\", European Journal of Physics 16, p. 14‚Äì20, 1995.R. Rashed, \\"A pioneer in anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on burning mirrors and lenses\\", Isis 81, p. 464‚Äì491, 1990 In the eleventh century Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965‚Äì1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that held that the form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy which held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex at the center of the eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.Masood 2009, pp.173‚Äì175 He was also an early proponent of the scientific method, the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence, five centuries before Renaissance scientists.Haq, Syed (2009). \\"Science in Islam\\".

Review on JSTOR, Toomer's 1964 review of Matthias Schramm (1963) Ibn Al-Haythams Weg Zur Physik Toomer p.464: \\"Schramm sums up [Ibn Al-Haytham's] achievement in the development of scientific method.\\" = Pharmacology = Ibn Sina teaching the use of drugs. 15th-century Great Canon of Avicenna Advances in botany and chemistry in the Islamic world encouraged developments in pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarƒ´ya RƒÅzi (Rhazes) (865‚Äì915) promoted the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936‚Äì1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris provides instructions for preparing \\"simples\\" from which were compounded the complex drugs then used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (died 869) was the first physician to describe a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Muwaffaq, in the 10th century, wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, describing chemicals such as arsenious oxide and silicic acid. He distinguished between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also of lead compounds. Al-Biruni (973‚Äì1050) wrote the Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), describing in detail the properties of drugs, the role of pharmacy and the duties of the pharmacist. Ibn Sina (Avicenna) described 700 preparations, their properties, their mode of action and their indications. He devoted a whole volume to simples in The Canon of Medicine. Works by Masawaih al-Mardini ( 925‚Äì1015) and by Ibn al- Wafid (1008‚Äì1074) were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by Mesue the Younger (died 1015) and as the Medicamentis simplicibus by Abenguefit ( 997 ‚Äì 1074) respectively. Peter of Abano (1250‚Äì1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Mardini under the title De Veneris. Ibn al-Baytar (1197‚Äì1248), in his Al- Jami fi al-Tibb, described a thousand simples and drugs based directly on Mediterranean plants collected along the entire coast between Syria and Spain, for the first time exceeding the coverage provided by Dioscorides in classical times. Islamic physicians such as Ibn Sina described clinical trials for determining the efficacy of medical drugs and substances. = Physics = Ahmad ibn M≈´sƒÅ ibn ShƒÅkir's treatise on mechanical devices, c. 850 The fields of physics studied in this period, apart from optics and astronomy which are described separately, are aspects of mechanics: statics, dynamics, kinematics and motion. In the sixth century John Philoponus ( 490 ‚Äì 570) rejected the Aristotelian view of motion. He argued instead that an object acquires an inclination to move when it has a motive power impressed on it. In the eleventh century Ibn Sina adopted roughly the same idea, namely that a moving object has force which is dissipated by external agents like air resistance. Ibn Sina distinguished between \\"force\\" and \\"inclination\\" (mayl); he claimed that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. He concluded that continuation of motion depends on the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that the object remains in motion until the mayl is spent. He also claimed that a projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon. That view accords with Newton's first law of motion, on inertia. As a non-Aristotelian suggestion, it was essentially abandoned until it was described as \\"impetus\\" by Jean Buridan ( 1295‚Äì1363), who was influenced by Ibn Sina's Book of Healing. In the Shadows, Ab≈´ Ray·∏•ƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ (973‚Äì1048) describes non-uniform motion as the result of acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-BarakƒÅt al-BaghdƒÅdƒ´ ( 1080 ‚Äì 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things, and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity. Ibn Bajjah (Avempace, 1085‚Äì1138) proposed that for every force there is a reaction force. While he did not specify that these forces be equal, this was still an early version of Newton's third law of motion. The Banu Musa brothers, Jafar-Muhammad, Ahmad and al-Hasan ( early 9th century) invented automated devices described in their Book of Ingenious Devices.Masood 2009, pp.161‚Äì163 = Zoology = Page from the KitƒÅb al-HayawƒÅn (Book of Animals) by Al-Jahiz. Ninth century Many classical works, including those of Aristotle, were transmitted from Greek to Syriac, then to Arabic, then to Latin in the Middle Ages. Aristotle's zoology remained dominant in its field for two thousand years. The KitƒÅb al-HayawƒÅn (ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸäŸàÿßŸÜ, English: Book of Animals) is a 9th-century Arabic translation of History of Animals: 1‚Äì10, On the Parts of Animals: 11‚Äì14,Kruk, R., 1979, The Arabic Version of Aristotle's Parts of Animals: book XI‚ÄìXIV of the Kitab al-Hayawan, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, Amsterdam-Oxford 1979. and Generation of Animals: 15‚Äì19.Kruk, R., 2003, \\"La zoologie aristot√©licienne. Tradition arabe\\", DPhA Supplement, 329‚Äì334 The book was mentioned by Al-Kindƒ´ (died 850), and commented on by Avicenna (Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ) in his The Book of Healing. Avempace (Ibn BƒÅjja) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd) commented on and criticised On the Parts of Animals and Generation of Animals. Significance Historians of science differ in their views of the significance of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell,Bertrand Russell (1945), History of Western Philosophy, book 2, part 2, chapter X holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam,Abdus Salam, H. R. Dalafi, Mohamed Hassan (1994). Renaissance of Sciences in Islamic Countries, p. 162. World Scientific, . George SalibaSaliba 1994, pp.245, 250, 256‚Äì257 and John M. HobsonHobson 2004, p.178 holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages.Abid Ullah Jan (2006), After Fascism: Muslims and the struggle for self- determination, \\"Islam, the West, and the Question of Dominance\\", Pragmatic Publishings, . Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y. Hassan argue that Islam was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.Ahmad Y. Hassan and Donald Routledge Hill (1986), Islamic Technology: An Illustrated History, p. 282, Cambridge University Press According to Ahmed Dallal, science in medieval Islam was \\"practiced on a scale unprecedented in earlier human history or even contemporary human history\\". Toby Huff takes the view that, although science in the Islamic world did produce localized innovations, it did not lead to a scientific revolution, which in his view required an ethos that existed in Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but not elsewhere in the world. Will Durant, Fielding H. Garrison, Hossein Nasr and Bernard Lewis held that Muslim scientists helped in laying the foundations for an experimental science with their contributions to the scientific method and their empirical, experimental and quantitative approach to scientific inquiry.Will Durant (1980). The Age of Faith (The Story of Civilization, Volume 4), p. 162‚Äì186. Simon & Schuster. .Fielding H. Garrison, An Introduction to the History of Medicine: with Medical Chronology, Suggestions for Study and Biblographic Data, p. 86 James E. McClellan III and Harold Dorn, reviewing the place of Islamic science in world history, comment that the positive achievement of Islamic science was simply to flourish, for centuries, in a wide range of institutions from observatories to libraries, madrasas to hospitals and courts, both at the height of the Islamic golden age and for some centuries afterwards. It plainly did not lead to a scientific revolution like that in Early modern Europe, but in their view, any such external comparison is just an attempt to impose \\"chronologically and culturally alien standards\\" on a successful medieval culture.

It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, olives and barley, as well as on goats, beehives and a press that was used for processing either olives or grapes.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 183. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 33Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In the late nineteenth century, the village of Tarbikha was described as being built of stone and situated on a ridge. The population was estimated at being around 100, and they lived by cultivating olives.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.150. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 33 During this period Tarbikha was a part of the Beirut province. Only after World War I, when the borders between Lebanon and Palestine were delineated by the British and French, did Tarbikha come under Palestinian administration.Khalidi, 1992, p.33 =British Mandate era= Map of the seven former Shia villages in Israel In the 1931 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tarbikha had a population of 674; 1 Christian and the rest Muslims, in a total of 149 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 103 The village had two mosques, and an elementary school, founded after 1938, which had an enrollment of 120 students in the mid-1940s. It also had a customs office and a police station for monitoring the Lebanese border. In the 1945 statistics the village population was counted together with that of Suruh and Al-Nabi Rubin, together they had 1000 Muslim inhabitants and a total of 18,563 dunams of land.

The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, described the village remaining structures in 1992: \\"About twenty houses from the village are now occupied by the residents of Moshav Shomera.

Location The village was situated on a flat spot in the Acre plain, northeast of Acre.Khalidi, 1992, p. 34 History Archaeological remains from the Roman and Byzantine eras have been found here.Getzov, Stern and Shapiro, 2016, Umm al-Faraj (Moshav Ben Ami) Sugar Moulds found here indicate that sugar productions started in the 11th century, under the Fatimid era. =Crusader/Mamluk era= The village was known to the Crusaders as Le Fierge, and belonged to the fief of Casal Imbert. In 1253 King Henry granted the whole estate of Casal Imbert, including Le Fierge, to John of Ibelin.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 84-85, No. 105; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 318, No. 1208; cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 264Ellenblum, 2003, p. 68 Shortly after, in 1256, John of Ibelin leased Az-Zeeb and all its depending villages (including Le Fierge) to the Teutonic Order for 10 years.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 328, No. 1250; cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 264 In 1261, Az-Zeeb, together with Le Fierge and Le Quiebre, were sold to the Teutonic Order, in return for an annual sum for as long as Acre was in Christian hands.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 106-7, No. 119; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, pp. 341-2, No. 1307 In 1283 it was still a part of the Crusader states, as it was mentioned as part of their domain in the hudna between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan Qalawun.The al-Qalqashandi version of the hudna, referred in Barag, 1979, p. 204, #24Khamisy, 2014, p. 93, #31 According to al-Maqrizi, it had come under Mamluk rule in 1291, when it was mentioned under the name of Farah when sultan al-Ashraf Khalil allocated the village's income to a Waqf in Cairo.al-Maqrizi, 1845, vol 2, p. 131Barag, 1979, p. 203 Sugar production continued here during the Crusader and Mamluk eras. =Ottoman era= Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, it appeared in the 1596 tax registers as Farja, being in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed), with a population of 24 households and 13 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, cotton, goats and beehives, in addition to \\"occasional revenues\\" and a water mill; a total of 1,576 ak√ße. Half of the revenues were given to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 193, has not identified it Rhode, 1979, p. 77Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. Sugar production continued here to the beginning of the seventeenth century CE. In 1799, the village was called El Fargi on the map of Pierre Jacotin.Karmon, 1960, p. 160 An inscription in marble, built into the wall above the gate of the village mosque, dates this building to 1254 H, (1838-39 C.E.).Sharon, 1999, pp. 170 -171 In May 1875, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the village. He described it as being surrounded by \\"delightful\\" gardens, irrigated with water from Nahr al-Mafshukh. Many houses were built with great care, and some had old pieces of stone built into them. He further noted that \\"the location of an old demolished church is still to a certain extent recognisable\\", and that all the 200 villagers were Muslim.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 45 -46 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described it as being built of stone and with a population of 200. The villagers planted fig, olive, mulberry and pomegranate trees.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.147. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.34 A population list from about 1887 showed Um el Ferj to have about 690 inhabitants, all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 190 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities Umm al Faraj had a population of 322, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Acre, p. 36 increasing in the 1931 census to 415, 2 Christians and 413 Muslims, in a total of 94 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 105 The older houses in the village were built close together and formed a circle, while the homes build after 1936 were scattered among the orchards. The population of Umm al- Faraj lived by agriculture. In the 1945 statistics, the population of Umm al- Faraj was 800, all Muslims, with a total land area of 825 dunams. In 1944/45 a total of was used for citrus and bananas, were used for cereals, were irrigated or used for orchards,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 131 =1948 War and aftermath= During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Umm al-Faraj was assaulted by Israel's Carmeli Brigade in the second stage of Operation Ben'Ami. The operational order, issued 19 May 1948, was to \\"attack with the aim of conquest, the killing of adult males, destruction and torching.\\"Morris, 2004, p. 253, note 727 The assault came on the 20‚Äì21 May 1948, when Carmeli forces attacked Umm al-Faraj together with Kabri, al Tell and Nahar, and then \\"demolished them,\\" according to Morris.Morris, 2004, pp. 253-254, note 729 Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The moshav of Ben Ami was established in 1949, in part on village land. The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village remains in 1992: \\"Only the stone mosque remains. It is shut and stands in a state of decay amid tall wild grass. Many trees that might predate the village's destruction can be seen. The nearby lands are cultivated; a banana grove belongs to the Ben Ammi settlement.\\" See also *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War References Bibliography  * *(p. 636) * * (For future expansion: Chapter 2: Mrs Zamzam in the Rashidieh refugee camp in southern Lebanon recalls Umm al-Faraj)      * * External links *Welcome to Umm-al-Faraj *Umm al-Faraj, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 3: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Um Al-Faraj photos, from Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh *Umm Al-Faraj, at Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center Category:District of Acre Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:Teutonic Order ","title":"Umm al-Faraj"},{"id":"267551","text":"HAL may refer to: Aviation * Halali Airport (IATA airport code: HAL) Halali, Oshikoto, Namibia * Hawaiian Airlines (ICAO airline code: HAL) * HAL Bangalore Airport or HAL Airport, Bangalore, India * Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Businesses * HAL Allergy, a Dutch pharmaceutical company * HAL Computer Systems, a defunct computer manufacturer * HAL Laboratory, a Japanese video game developer * Halliburton's New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol * Hamburg America Line, a shipping company * Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, an Indian aerospace manufacturer of fighter aircraft and helicopters * Hindustan Antibiotics Limited, an Indian public sector pharmaceutical manufacturer * Holland America Line, a cruise ship operator * HAL FM, or CHNS-FM, a classic rock station in Halifax, Nova Scotia Computing * Hardware abstraction layer, a layer of software that hides hardware differences from higher level programs * HAL (software), an implementation of a hardware abstraction layer for Unix-like systems * HAL/S, the computer language used to program the Space Shuttle's computers * HAL, a Lotus Development Corporation product released in 1986 * Hackers at Large, a Dutch hackers and security conference * Hypertext Application Language, a standard convention for defining hypermedia such as links to external resources within JSON or XML code Entertainment * HAL 9000, a fictional computer in the Space Odyssey series * Hal (Japanese band), a Japanese pop band * Hal (Irish band), an Irish rock band * H.A.L.

He was the first President of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) and its most influential theologian. He is commemorated by that church on its Calendar of Saints on May 7. He has been described as a man who sacrificed his homeland, his health, and nearly his life for the freedom to speak freely, to believe freely, and to live freely, by emigrating from Germany to the United States. Life C.F.W. Walther was born a pastor's son in Langenchursdorf in the Kingdom of Saxony (part of modern-day Germany). Out of a strong religious commitment, he immigrated to the United States in 1838. On September 21, 1841, he married Emilie Buenger. They had six children. He started two important publications, and was author of many books and periodical articles. He was also the head pastor of the four Saxon Lutheran congregations (called Gesammtgemeinde) in St. Louis (Trinity, Holy Cross, Immanuel, and Zion). In August 1855, Walther turned down an honorary doctorate from the University of G√∂ttingen, but in 1877 he accepted a Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) degree from Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. He died of a serious illness in St. Louis on May 7, 1887, and was buried at Concordia Cemetery, where a mausoleum was later built in his honor.\\"C.F.W. (Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm) Walther (1811-1887) Papers, c.1828-1887.\\" Accessed 14 Mar 2013 = Early = Ferdinand, as he was called by his family, was first educated by his father. At the age of eight he attended school in Hohenstein for two years. He then entered \\"Latein Schule\\" (\\"Latin school\\", college preparatory school comparable to today's junior or community college) in Schneeberg, from which he graduated in September 1829. One month later he enrolled in the University of Leipzig to begin his study of theology and joined his older brother Otto Hermann, who was enrolled in the same university. During his college years in Leipzig he contracted a near-fatal lung disease and had to interrupt his studies for six months. While ill and recuperating, he assiduously read the works of Martin Luther and became convinced that Luther's theology clearly taught the doctrines of Holy Scripture. He also began believing in the importance of a firm confessional position. In 1833, Ferdinand took his first exam at the university. This examination authorized him to accept a position as a private tutor for a family in the town of Kahla. The experience of two years' tutoring qualified him to take his second examination in Leipzig and graduate. On January 15, 1837, he was ordained to the Lutheran clergy and became a pastor in the town of Br√§unsdorf in Saxony. As part of his pastoral duties, he taught religion classes in the local school. He soon, however, found himself at odds with the rationalistic government of the Kingdom of Saxony because he believed it departed from the faith and practice of historic Lutheranism and promoted false doctrine‚Äîto him a lack of orthodoxy. Many other conservative Lutherans also opposed the Saxon government's liberal religious policies. =Exodus from Saxony= Walther and several hundred of the other dissenters came together under the leadership of a pastor holding similar views‚ÄîMartin Stephan from Dresden. In November 1838, under Stephan's ongoing direction, 800 Saxon immigrants left on five ships for America in what is known as the Saxon Lutheran Migration, hoping for the freedom to practice their religious beliefs. The settlers arrived in New Orleans on January 5, 1839. The group settled either in St. Louis, Missouri or to the south along the Mississippi River in Perry County, Missouri. = Controversy over \\"Bishop\\" Stephan = Soon after the immigrants were settled in the new homeland, their leader and self-proclaimed \\"bishop of the new settlement\\", Martin Stephan, was accused of financial and sexual misconduct and was expelled from the settlement. His departure left Walther as one of the most well-respected clergymen remaining. = The Altenburg Debate = thumb The group of immigrants was deeply disturbed and unsure whether they were still a Lutheran congregation after having left the authorities and church hierarchy in Germany behind. Walther, who was originally called to be the pastor of a dual parish in the Perry County settlements of Dresden and Johannisberg, struggled over the questions that the other pastors and laity were also asking. In April 1841, soon after his brother Otto Herman of St. Louis had died, a public debate was held between Walther and attorney Marbach, one of the lay leaders of the settlers, in what is known as the \\"Altenburg Debate\\". Walther convinced Marbach that they could validly consider themselves to be a church. He then accepted the call to his brother's congregation in St. Louis, Trinity Lutheran Church, and served that congregation from May 1841 until his death.Christian Cyclopedia, s.v. \\"Altenburg Thesis\\" (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1954).Christian Cyclopedia, s.v. \\"Altenburg Thesis\\" (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 2000). = Walther's ministry = During his forty years of work in the LCMS, Walther held several key positions. A log cabin college, which Walther helped to found, opened in December 1839 in Altenburg and eventually developed into Concordia Seminary in St. Louis. Walther became its first president and held that position for the remainder of his life. On April 26, 1847, the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod was founded. Walther served as its first president, a position he held from 1847 to 1850 and again from 1864 to 1878. In 1861, he also became president of the synod's \\"practical\\" seminary (today's Concordia Theological Seminary) while it was co-located with Concordia Seminary for several years. He also founded and edited several Lutheran periodicals, including Der Lutheraner and Lehre und Wehre. He wrote a number of theological books. Perhaps his best known work is The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel, which is a transcription of a series of evening lectures he gave at the seminary He is also the author of the text and tune of the hymn \\"He's Risen, He's Risen\\" () found in the hymnals of the LCMS and other Lutheran bodies. and \\"Walther\\" for the tune (mp3 is organ only) Portrait of an elderly C.

Cruise control (sometimes known as speed control or autocruise, or tempomat in some countries) is a system that automatically controls the speed of a motor vehicle. The system is a servomechanism that takes over the throttle of the car to maintain a steady speed as set by the driver. History Speed control was used in automobiles as early as 1900 in the Wilson-Pilcher and also in the 1910s by Peerless. Peerless advertised that their system would \\"maintain speed whether up hill or down\\". The technology was adopted by James Watt and Matthew Boulton in 1788 to control steam engines, but the use of governors dates at least back to the 17th century. On an engine the governor adjusts the throttle position as the speed of the engine changes different loads, so as to maintain a near constant speed. Modern cruise control (also known as a speedostat or tempomat) was invented in 1948 by the inventor and mechanical engineer Ralph Teetor.Speed control device for resisting operation of the accelerator. Ralph R. Teetor. US-Patent 2519859 A His idea was ostensibly borne out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. More significant factor in developing this device was the speed limit imposed across the US during World War II to save on gasoline use and reduce tire wear. A mechanism controlled by the driver provided resistance to further pressure on the accelerator pedal when the vehicle reaching the desired speed. Teetor's idea of a dashboard speed selector with a mechanism connected to the drive shaft and a device able to push against the gas pedal was patented in 1950. He added a speed lock capability that would maintain the car's speed until the drivers tapped the brake pedal or turned off the system. The first car with Teetor's \\"Speedostat\\" system was the 1958 Imperial (called \\"Auto- pilot\\") using a speed dial on the dashboard. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations off the rotating speedometer-cable, and used a bi-directional screw-drive electric motor to vary throttle position as needed. It was Cadillac Division that renamed the \\"Speedostat\\" and marketed the device as \\"Cruise Control.\\" Cruise Control unit in the speedometer-cable and vacuum valve Cruise Control throttle servo A 1955 U.S. Patent for a \\"Constant Speed Regulator\\" was filed in 1950 by M-Sgt Frank J. Riley.Constant Speed Regulator. Frank J. Riley. United States Patent US2714880 He installed his invention, which he conceived while driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, on his own car in 1948.The Keesler News. Nov 4, 1948 Another inventor named Harold Exline, working independently of Riley, also invented a type of cruise control, which he first installed on his own car and on cars belonging to friends of his. Exline filed a U.S. Patent for \\"Vacuum Powered Throttle Control With Electrically Controlled Air Valve\\" in 1951, and the Patent was granted in 1956.Vacuum powered throttle control with electrically controlled air valve. Harold Exline. US Patent 2742123 Despite these patents, Riley, Exline, and the subsequent patent holders were not able to collect royalties for any of the inventions using cruise control. In 1965, American Motors Corporation (AMC) introduced a low-priced automatic speed control for its large-sized cars with automatic transmissions. The AMC \\"Cruise-Command\\" unit was engaged by a push-button once the desired speed was reached and then the throttle position was adjusted by a vacuum control directly from the speedometer cable rather than a separate dial on the dashboard. Daniel Aaron Wisner invented \\"Automotive Electronic Cruise Control\\" in 1968 as an engineer for RCA's Industrial and Automation Systems Division in Plymouth, Michigan. His invention described in two patents filed that year (US 3570622 & US 3511329), with the second modifying his original design by debuting digital memory, was the first electronic device in controlling a car. Two decades passed before an integrated circuit for his design was developed by Motorola as the MC14460 Automotive Speed Control Processor in CMOS. The advantage of electronic speed control over its mechanical predecessor was that it could be integrated with electronic accident avoidance and engine management systems. Following the 1973 oil crisis and rising fuel prices, the device became more popular in the U.S. \\"Cruise control can save gas by avoiding surges that expel fuel\\" while driving at steady speeds. In 1974, AMC, GM, and Chrysler priced the option at $60 to $70, while Ford charged $103. Operation The driver must bring the vehicle up to speed manually and use a button to set the cruise control to the current speed. The cruise control takes its speed signal from a rotating driveshaft, speedometer cable, wheel speed sensor from the engine's RPM, or from internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle. Most systems do not allow the use of the cruise control below a certain speed - typically around . The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the throttle cable with a solenoid, a vacuum driven servomechanism, or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle (fully electronic) if it uses a 'drive-by-wire' system. All cruise control systems must be capable of being turned off both explicitly and automatically when the driver depresses the brake, and often also the clutch. Cruise control often includes a memory feature to resume the set speed after braking, and a coast feature to reduce the set speed without braking. When the cruise control is engaged, the throttle can still be used to accelerate the car, but once the pedal is released the car will then slow down until it reaches the previously set speed. On the latest vehicles fitted with electronic throttle control, cruise control can be easily integrated into the vehicle's engine management system. Modern \\"adaptive\\" systems (see below) include the ability to automatically reduce speed when the distance to a car in front, or the speed limit, decreases. This is an advantage for those driving in unfamiliar areas. The cruise control systems of some vehicles incorporate a \\"speed limiter\\" function, which will not allow the vehicle to accelerate beyond a pre-set maximum; this can usually be overridden by fully depressing the accelerator pedal. (Most systems will prevent the vehicle accelerating beyond the chosen speed, but will not apply the brakes in the event of overspeeding downhill.) On vehicles with a manual transmission, cruise control is less flexible because the act of depressing the clutch pedal and shifting gears usually disengages the cruise control. The \\"resume\\" feature has to be used each time after selecting the new gear and releasing the clutch. Therefore, cruise control is of most benefit at motorway/highway speeds when top gear is used virtually all the time. Advantages and disadvantages  Some advantages of cruise control include: * It's useful for long drives (reducing driver fatigue, improving comfort by allowing positioning changes more safely) across highways and sparsely populated roads. * Some drivers use it to avoid violating speed limits. A driver who otherwise tends to unconsciously increase speed over the course of a highway journey may avoid speeding. *Increased fuel efficiency However, when used incorrectly cruise control can lead to accidents due to several factors, such as: * speeding around curves that require slowing down * rough or loose terrain that could negatively affect the cruise control controls * rainy or wet weather could lose traction * Encourages drivers to pay less attention to driving, increasing the risk of an accident Adaptive cruise control adaptive cruise control (ACC) SteeringSwitch Nissan Note e-Power Some modern vehicles have systems for adaptive cruise control (ACC), which is a general term meaning improved cruise control. These improvements can be automatic braking or dynamic set-speed type controls. Automatic Braking Type: the automatic braking type use either a single or combination of sensors (radar, lidar, and camera) to allow the vehicle to keep pace with the car it is following, slow when closing in on the vehicle in front and accelerating again to the preset speed when traffic allows. Some systems also feature forward collision warning systems, which warn the driver if a vehicle in front--given the speed of both vehicles--gets too close (within the preset headway or braking distance). Dynamic Set Speed Type: The dynamic set speed uses the GPS position of speed limit signs, from a database. Some are modifiable by the driver. Non-Braking Type: The speed can be adjusted to allow traffic calming. Dynamic radar cruise control: uses a camera and millimeter-wave radar to maintain a set point distance from vehicles in front of the car; the system will automatically slow down or speed up based on the vehicles in front.

It is also the name of the largest existing town in the Nazca Province. The name is derived from the Nazca culture, which flourished in the area between 100 BCE and 800 CE. This culture was responsible for the Nazca Lines and the ceremonial city of Cahuachi. They also constructed additional underground aqueducts, named puquios, in a regional system that still functions today. The first puquios are believed to have been built by the preceding Paracas culture. Nazca is the capital of the Nazca Province located in the Ica District of the Ica region of Peru.  Earthquake  On November 12, 1996, at 11:59 a.m. local time (16:59 GMT) there was an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 with its epicenter at 7.7 km into the sea. The earthquake almost completely destroyed the city of Nazca and its surroundings. Due to its occurrence during the day, there were only 14 fatalities. However, 1,500 people were injured and around 100,000 were left homeless. Within 12 years Nazca has been almost completely rebuilt. Since 1997, Nazca has been the location of a major Canadian gold mining operation. The indigenous people at the time did not own the rights to their traditional communal lands. As a result, they were forcibly displaced. Since then, they have sought to legalize their ancient ownership of land and fixed property. Climate A fruit stand with sandwiches open early for breakfast in Nazca near the main farmers market Nazca is one of the most arid regions in the world, with an average annual precipitation of 4 millimeters. Nazca's weather is controlled by Humboldt's Current, which carries water from Antarctica up the west coast of South America. This cold ocean water cools the air and limits the accumulation of moisture within clouds; as a result, though clouds and fog are able to form, there is little rain. Nazca's temperatures range from 10 to 32 ¬∞C with an average daily high of 21 ¬∞C. Summer months from November to March are dry, sunny, and hot. During the winter from June to August, fog from the coast rolls over the hills to keep temperatures in the moderate range; however, the intense sun makes daylight hours seem hotter than they are. History The city of Nazca There are two versions of the Spanish foundation. According to the writings of chroniclers, the city was founded on October 28, 1548, commissioned by Pedro de la Gasca, peacemaker by Alonso de Mendoza. The other version states that it was founded in 1591 by the Viceroy Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca√±ete. During the Spanish colonial period, Nazca was known for viticulture, producing wine and grape brandy (aguardiente de la uva). Today this is commonly called pisco, after the famous port of the same name. Locally, the brandy is known as Nasca. These products were widely distributed throughout the viceroyalty of Peru and beyond.Cushner, Nicholas P. 1980. Lords of the Land: Sugar, Wine, and Jesuit Estates of Coastal Peru, 1600-1767. Albany: State University of New York Press. The largest of the Nazca vineyards were located in the rich Ingenio Valley, and were property of the Society of Jesus, Jesuit missionaries and priests.Macera, Pablo. 1966. Instrucciones para el manejo de las haciendas jesu√≠tas del Per√∫, ss. XVII-XVIII. Lima: Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos: Facultad de Letras y Ciencias Humanas, Departamento de Historia. The hacienda San Joseph de la Nasca, located in the upper part of the middle Ingenio Valley, was owned by the Jesuit College of Cuzco. San Francisco Xavier de la Nasca, in the lower part of the middle valley, was owned by the Jesuit College of San Pablo in Lima. Both of these estates used numerous workers who were enslaved persons of sub-Saharan African descent. In addition to producing wines and brandies, both estates had substantial infrastructure for producing the ceramic storage jars, known as botijas, in which the wine and brandy was transported.Negro, Sandra. 2005. \\"Arquitectura, poder y esclavitud en las haciendas jesuitas de la Nasca en el Per√∫\\", In Esclavitud, econom√≠a y evangelizaci√≥n: Las haciendas jesuitas en la Am√©rica Virreinal. S. Negro and M.M. Marzal, eds. Pp. 449-492. Lima: Fondo Editorial de la Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Per√∫. Today, the towns of San Javier and San Jos√© are known for the ruins of the large 18th- century baroque churches built during the Jesuit administration of these estates. In 1767, following the expulsion of the Society of Jesus by King Charles III of Spain, the Crown confiscated and administered these properties as royal estates. Nazca city square Nazca Patriots received the Liberating Expedition of General Don Jose de San Martin on October 14, 1820, after they escaped from the Battle of Nasca. Two days earlier, on October 12, General Juan Antonio √Ålvarez de Arenales, from Ica, was sent to the South in pursuit of the royal troops of Colonel Manuel Quimper fleeing from Ica. The second commander and chief of staff of the Division de la Sierra, was Argentine Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Rojas Argerich. He commanded 250 men: 110 infantry and 140 cavalry. The town of Nasca was established on August 29, 1821. On July 2, 1855, it was elevated to a district and then it became a province on January 23, 1941. Nasca, as the name is spelled in the 21st century, still has a dry climate. Before and during the time of the Inca, it had a formidable system of hydraulic engineering. The water was accessed through filtration galleries from underground branches, called aqueducts. The openings to the system were called puquios. More than three dozen continue to operate, to irrigate farmland and provide domestic needs. Nazca lines Nazca Lines Underground Cantalloc Aqueducts The Nazca culture is famous for its desert line drawings, the product of complex construction projects carried out by a hierarchical society from 500 BCE to 500 CE. Contrary to the popular belief that the lines and figures can be seen only from an aircraft, they are also visible from the surrounding foothills and other high places.Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Ancient, medieval, and non-European art.

There are innumerable formations of both animals and geometric designs. Local tour companies sell flights (sobreveltos) over 12 main figures, the most famous of which are the hummingbird, the condor, and the monkey. The spiral tail of the monkey inspired the spiral in the \\"P\\" of the Per√∫ logo, which is also found on its currency. UNESCO declared the Nazca Lines a World Heritage Site in 1994. Airport Nazca has a small airport, the Maria Reiche Neuman Airport, used mainly for touristic flights over the Nazca lines. It was named for a woman who did much to study the Nazca lines and bring them to international attention as products of pre-Hispanic man.

He spent much of his early adult life among the Hurons, and mastered their language and learned their culture. Br√ªl√© became an interpreter and guide for Samuel de Champlain, who later sent Br√ªl√© on a number of exploratory missions, among which he is thought to have preceded Champlain to the Great Lakes, reuniting with him upon Champlain's first arrival at Lake Huron. Among his many travels were explorations of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, as well as the Humber and Ottawa Rivers. Champlain agreed to send Br√ªl√©, at his own request, as an interpreter to live among the Onontchataron, an Algonquin people, in 1610. In 1629, during the Anglo-French War, he escaped after being captured by the Seneca tribe. Br√ªl√© was killed by the Bear tribe of the Huron people, who believed he had betrayed them to the Seneca. Early life in France A plaque to commemorate √âtienne Br√ªl√©'s discovery of the pathway to the Humber in Etienne Brule Park of Toronto, Ontario, puts his date of birth at 1595. Br√ªl√© was born in Paris, France. Many of the parish registers of Champigny-sur-Marne were lost sometime between 1590 and 1600, and so Br√ªl√©'s exact date of birth is unknown. He came to Canada when he was only 16 years old, in 1608. Br√ªl√© has not left any recollection or description of his early life, his life among the indigenous peoples, or of his expeditions. Therefore, his existence has been viewed through the works of others, including Champlain, Sagard, and Br√©beuf. Life in New France Champlain wrote of a youth who had been living in New France since 1608, and whom many believe to have been young Br√ªl√©. In June 1610, Br√ªl√© told Champlain that he wished to go and live with the Algonquins and learn their language as well as better understand their customs and habits. Champlain made the arrangement to do so and in return, the chief Iroquet (an Algonquin leader of the Petite nation who wintered his people near Huronia), requested that Champlain take Savignon, a young Huron, with him to teach him the customs and habits of the French. Champlain instructed Br√ªl√© to learn the Huron language, explore the country, establish good relations with all first nations, and report back in one year's time with all that he had learned. On 13 June 1611, Champlain returned to visit Br√ªl√©, who astonishingly had done all that Champlain had asked of him. Br√ªl√© was dressed as though he was one of the indigenous people and was extremely pleased with the way he was treated and all that he had learned. Champlain requested that Br√ªl√© continue to live among the Indigenous peoples so that he could fully master everything, and Br√ªl√© agreed. For four years, Champlain had had no connection or communication with Br√ªl√© who, it is thought, was then the first European to see Great Lakes. In 1615, they met again at Huronia. There, Br√ªl√© informed Champlain of his adventures and explorations through North America. Br√ªl√© explained that he was joined by another French interpreter by the name of Grenolle. He reported that they had travelled along the north shore of what they called la mer douce (the calm sea), now known as Lake Huron, and went as far as the great rapids of Sault Ste. Marie where Lake Superior enters Lake Huron.(online: archive.org, Library of Congress) In 1615, Br√ªl√© asked permission from Champlain to join 12 Huron warriors on their mission to see the Andaste (Susquehannock) people, allies of the Hurons, to ask them for their support during an expedition Champlain was planning. Champlain ordered the party to travel west of the Seneca country because they needed to arrive there quickly and the only way to do so was by crossing over enemy territory. This proved to be dangerous but semi-successful for Br√ªl√© did reach the Andastes; however, he arrived at the meeting place Champlain chose two days too late to assist Champlain and the Hurons, who had been defeated by the Iroquois. Br√ªl√© probably visited four of the five Great Lakes‚ÄîLake Huron, Lake Superior, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario‚Äîand may have also seen Lake Michigan. Br√ªl√© was more than likely the first white European to complete these expeditions across North America. In these expeditions he visited places such as the Ottawa River, Mattawa River, Lake Nipissing, and the French River to Georgian Bay. From Georgian Bay, Br√ªl√© was able to cut into Lake Huron. He paddled up the St. Marys River and portaged into Lake Superior. He journeyed through Lake Simcoe and portaged through what is now Toronto to Lake Ontario. From Lake Ontario Br√ªl√© was able to travel in Upstate New York and explore Pennsylvania and cross down the Susquehanna River to Chesapeake Bay.Brule, Etienne, 1592?‚Äì1632 It is also said that it is very probable that Br√ªl√© was one of the first Europeans to stand along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. He had spent months visiting indigenous peoples that lived along Lake Erie between the Niagara and Detroit Rivers, but because he left no writings of his own, almost nothing identifiable is known about the tribes he visited, many of which would be obliterated a few decades later in the Beaver Wars (in contrast, Joseph de La Roche Daillon, who conducted a missionary journey among the tribes of Western New York in 1627, kept meticulous notes of his journeys; it is de La Roche's writings that serve as the primary history of pre-Beaver Wars native occupation of Western New York). Champlain and the Jesuits often spoke out against Br√ªl√©'s adoption of Huron customs, as well as his association with the fur traders, who were beyond the control of the colonial government. Br√ªl√© returned to Quebec in 1618, but Champlain advised him to continue his explorations among the Hurons. Br√ªl√© was later confined in Quebec for a year, where he taught the Jesuits the natives' language. In 1626 Br√ªl√© returned to France, where he worked as a merchant, and in 1626 or 1627 he married Alizon Coiffier. In April 1628, Br√ªl√© and his French fleet were captured by the British off Anticosti Island and Br√ªl√© was brought to London before being released and returned to New France where, \\"pledging support to the Kirkes, he resumed his life among the Wendat and his trading activities.\\" In 1629, Br√ªl√© betrayed the colony of New France. David Kirke and his brothers, English merchants of Huguenot extraction, paid 100 pistoles to Br√ªl√© and three of his companions to pilot their ships up the St. Lawrence river and \\"undoubtedly gave information as to the desperate state of Quebec's garrison\\" that emboldened the Kirkes to attack it. In his last accounts, Samuel Champlain \\"accused Br√ªl√© of treason because the latter agreed to do business with the Kirke brothers when they took Quebec for England in 1629.\\" After 1629, Br√ªl√© continued to live with the Natives, acting as an interpreter in their dealings with the French traders. Death In 1633, Br√ªl√© died at Toanch√©, on the Penetanguishene peninsula, Ontario, however the actual events surrounding his death remain unclear. The rumours of his death first reached Quebec through second and third party accounts largely by the Algonquins, who at the time, were believed to be in a trading dispute with the Hurons.Sandoz, Mari (1978). The Beaver Men: Spearheads of Empire. U of Nebraska Press. pp.42-43 One theory is that he was captured by the Seneca Iroquois in battle. Though he managed to escape, when he returned to his home among the Hurons, they did not believe his story. Suspecting him of trading with the Senecas, Br√ªl√© was stabbed to death ‚Äî his body dismembered and eaten by the villagers. However, contrary to this theory, there is no ethnographic evidence that the Hurons practiced cannibalism.Pitek, Emily (2019, August 13). Huron also known as ‚ÄúWendat‚Äù. UBC Community and Partner Publications. Database of Religious History (DRH). pp.7-8 Additionally, Jean de Br√©beuf, who arrived in the region shortly after Br√ªl√©'s death, described his murder as treacherous, but made no mention of cannibalism. One explanation is that the Hurons were misinterpreted ‚Äî using the term \\"eaten\\" in the sense that Br√ªl√© was thrown from his high position. This meaning was used by them in the past to describe deposed chieftains. Br√ªl√©'s murder also appears to have been controversial among the Huron people. In the immediate aftermath of his death, Toanch√© was abandoned and subsequently Wenrio and Ihonatiria were founded ‚Äî suggesting a schism formed in the clan between those that supported Br√ªl√©'s murder and those that didn't.Trigger, Bruce G. (1987). Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660. McGill-Queen's Press. pp.473-476 To further complicate the matter, Father La Jeune wrote in his 1633 journal in Jesuit Relations that on the last day of June, 1633 he met a French Interpreter among an envoy of Hurons that had lived among them for many years. It is unlikely he could be referring to anyone besides Br√ªl√© despite conflicting reports Br√ªl√© was already dead.

It is endemic to Texas, United States. It was first found in Barton Springs in Austin, but is now also known from other localities in the nearby Travis and Hays Counties. Barton Springs salamanders are average-sized (adults grow to approximately in total length) and have mottled coloration varying from darkish purple to light yellow. Environmental impact Amphibian species worldwide have been in decline due to climate change including but not limited to: increased UV radiation, change in precipitation, and various pathogen outbreaks (chytrid fungus which causes Chytridiomycosis). However, habitat destruction, degradation, and pollution on a local scale have resulted mainly from land and watershed urbanization. These changes, in turn, affect, among others, water quality and biological community composition of rivers and water systems in the surrounding environment. The wide effects of contamination and degradation on these water systems make analyzing their specific sources difficult since the interactions of factors and overlapping effects may occur. Nonetheless, it is important to study these consequences so that future impact on this and other species may be reduced. =Oxygen absorption= Dissolved oxygen (DO) is required at specific levels to maintain healthy aquatic life. To do this, \\"national ambient water quality criteria\\" have been set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and measurements have been made since 1969, albeit inconsistently. Hypoxia, a state of reduced oxygen, may hinder embryonic and fetal development as well as decrease oxygen consumption in adults. Apart from prenatal developments, physiological responses may also arise from a lack of oxygen. Some of the known responses include \\"Increases in heart rate and buccal pumping, behavioral hypothermia, and gill hypertrophy\\". Since this species is an obligately aquatic neotene, retains its gills through its adult life, it must absorb oxygen through its gills or skin. However, the method in which it performs this absorption has yet to be determined. One study found that when presented with a low DO level, this salamander increases its body movement. They theorized two explanations for this reaction: # low and high DO levels may be found relatively close, therefore movement will allow this species to migrate to a higher DO environment, # the physical movement causes a decrease between boundary layers adjacent to skin and gills, which allows for greater flow of oxygen. Diet and behavior Much of the Barton Springs salamander's life history remains unknown at this time. It appears that they feed primarily on small aquatic crustaceans, but can supplement their diet with other items, such as earthworms. In addition, aquatic vegetation has been shown to be a critical component to the salamander's habitat; their numbers dropped precipitously after the removal of much of the vegetation from Barton Springs, and have recovered after habitat restoration programs were implemented. Etymology The species epithet (sosorum) is an acronym for \\"Save Our Springs Ordinance\\" (of the City of Austin) although it is widely if erroneously believed to refer to SOS Alliance, a local preservation group combined with a Latin genitive plural ending. Conservation status Preserved specimen Despite inhabiting an urban area, E. sosorum was not described until 1993. It was put on the federal List of Threatened and Endangered Species in 1997. The salamander's listing prevented the City of Austin from cleaning the Barton Springs Pool as it had for 70 years‚Äîwith bleach. As a result, the City of Austin applied for and was issued an Incidental Take Permit under Section 10(a)(1)(b) of the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1998. The permit has a term of 15 years and allows incidental taking of salamanders during pool cleaning and maintenance. As a mitigation measure, the City offered to direct 10% of revenue generated through pool entry fees into a conservation fund that is used for research and habitat enhancement.

It generally flows to the east and southeast as it traverses the U.S. states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The river's source basin lies in the western United States in Colorado, specifically the Arkansas River Valley, where the headwaters derive from the snowpack in the Sawatch and Mosquito mountain ranges. It then flows east into the Midwest via Kansas, and finally into the South through Oklahoma and Arkansas. At , it is the sixth-longest river in the United States, the second-longest tributary in the Mississippi‚ÄìMissouri system, and the 45th longest river in the world. Its origin is in the Rocky Mountains in Lake County, Colorado, near Leadville. In 1859, placer gold discovered in the Leadville area brought thousands seeking to strike it rich, but the easily recovered placer gold was quickly exhausted. The Arkansas River's mouth is at Napoleon, Arkansas, and its drainage basin covers nearly .See watershed maps: 1 Its volume is much smaller than the Missouri and Ohio Rivers, with a mean discharge of about . The Arkansas from its headwaters to the 100th meridian west formed part of the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border from the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty (in force 1821) until the Texas Annexation or Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Pronunciations Name pronunciation varies by region. Some people in the upper reaches of the river, particularly in Kansas and eastern parts of Colorado, pronounce it ,Random House Dictionary People in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and the central part of Colorado, typically pronounce it , which is how the Arkansas state has always been pronounced since a state law was passed in 1881. Physical geography =Course changes= The path of the Arkansas River has changed over time. Sediments from the river found in a palaeochannel next to Nolan, a site in the Tensas Basin, show that part of the river's meander belt flowed through up to 5200 BP. Whilst it was previously thought that this relict channel was active at the same time as another relict of Mississippi River's meander belt, it has been shown that this channel of the Arkansas was inactive approximately 400 years before the Mississippi channel was active. =Hydrography= The headwaters of the Arkansas near Leadville, Colorado The Arkansas has three distinct sections in its long path through central North America. At its headwaters beginning near Leadville, Colorado, the Arkansas runs as a steep fast-flowing mountain river through the Rockies in its narrow valley, dropping in . This section supports extensive whitewater rafting, including The Numbers (near Granite, Colorado), Brown's Canyon, and the Royal Gorge. At Ca√±on City, Colorado, the Arkansas River valley widens and flattens markedly. Just west of Pueblo, Colorado, the river enters the Great Plains. Through the rest of Colorado, Kansas, and much of Oklahoma, it is a typical Great Plains riverway, with wide, shallow banks subject to seasonal flooding and periods of dwindling flow. Tributaries include the Cimarron River and the Salt Fork Arkansas River. In eastern Oklahoma the river begins to widen further into a more contained consistent channel. To maintain more reliable flow rates, a series of large reservoir lakes have been built on the Arkansas and its intersecting tributaries including the Canadian, Verdigris, Neosho (Grand), Illinois, and Poteau rivers.O'Dell, Larry. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Arkansas River. These locks and dams allow the river to be navigable by barges and large river craft downriver of Muskogee, Oklahoma, where the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System joins in with the Verdigris River. Into western Arkansas, the river path works between the encroaching Boston and Ouachita Mountains, including many isolated, flat-topped mesas, buttes, or monadnocks such as Mount Nebo, Petit Jean Mountain, and Mount Magazine, the highest point in the state. The river valley then expands as it encounters much flatter land beginning just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. It continues eastward across the plains and forests of eastern Arkansas until it flows into the Mississippi River near Napoleon, Arkansas. Water flow in the Arkansas River (as measured in central Kansas) has dropped from approximately average from 1944‚Äì1963 to average from 1984‚Äì2003, largely because of the pumping of groundwater for irrigation in eastern Colorado and western Kansas. Important cities along the Arkansas River include Canon City, Colorado; Pueblo, Colorado; La Junta, Colorado; Lamar, Colorado; Garden City, Kansas; Dodge City, Kansas; Wichita, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Fort Smith, Arkansas; and Little Rock, Arkansas. The May 2002 I-40 bridge disaster took place on I-40's crossing of Kerr Reservoir on the Arkansas River near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma. Allocation problems Since 1902, Kansas has claimed Colorado takes too much of the river's water, resulting in a number of lawsuits before the U.S. Supreme Court that continue to this day,Kansas v. Colorado 514 U.S. 673 (1995), 185 U.S. 125 (1902) generally under the name of Kansas v. Colorado. The problems over the possession and use of Arkansas River water by Colorado and Kansas led to the creation of an interstate compact or agreement between the two states. While Congress approved the Arkansas River Compact in 1949, the compact did not stop further disputes by the two states over water rights to the river. The Kansas‚ÄìOklahoma Arkansas River Basin Compact was created in 1965 to promote mutual consideration and equity over water use in the basin shared by those states. It led to the Kansas‚ÄìOklahoma Arkansas River Commission, which was charged with administering the compact and reducing pollution. The compact was approved and implemented by both states in 1970, and has been in force since then. Riverway commerce Inland waterway system with McClellan-Kerr Navigational Channel shown in red The McClellan‚ÄìKerr Arkansas River Navigation System begins at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa on the Verdigris River, enters the Arkansas River near Muskogee, and runs via an extensive lock and dam system to the Mississippi River. Through Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams which artificially deepen and widen the river to sustain commercial barge traffic and recreational use give the river the appearance of a series of reservoirs.\\"McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System 2016 Inland Waterway Fact Sheet\\". Oklahoma Department of Transportation. 2016. Accessed June 16, 2017. The McClellan‚ÄìKerr Arkansas River Navigation System diverts from the Arkansas River upstream of the Wilbur D. Mills Dam to avoid the long winding route which the lower Arkansas River follows. This circuitous portion of the Arkansas River between the Wilbur D. Mills Dam and the Mississippi River was historically bypassed by river vessels; early steamboats instead following a network of rivers‚Äîknown as the Arkansas Post Canal--which flowed north of the lower Arkansas River and followed a shorter and more direct route to the Mississippi River. When the McClellan‚ÄìKerr Arkansas River Navigation System was constructed between 1963 and 1970, the Arkansas Post Canal was significantly improved, while the lower Arkansas River continued to be bypassed by commercial vessels. The river in history Arkansas River in Colorado, with Mount Harvard in distance, circa 1867. Photo by William Henry Jackson. Many nations of Native Americans lived near, or along, the 1,450-mile (2,334-km) stretch of the Arkansas River for thousands of years. The first Europeans to see the river were members of the Spanish Coronado expedition on June 29, 1541. Also in the 1540s, Hernando de Soto discovered the junction of the Arkansas with the Mississippi. The Spanish originally called the river Napeste. \\"The name \\"Arkansas\\" was first applied by Father Jacques Marquette, who called the river Akansa in his journal of 1673. The Joliet-Marquette expedition travelled the Mississippi River from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin towards the Gulf of Mexico, but turned back at the mouth of the Arkansas River. By that time, they had encountered Native Americans carrying European trinkets, and feared confrontation with Spanish conquistadors. Jean-Baptiste B√©nard de la Harpe, a French trader, explorer and nobleman had led an expedition into what is now Oklahoma in 1718‚Äì19. His original objective was to establish a trading post near the present city of Texarkana, Arkansas, but he then extended his trip overland as far north as the Arkansas River (which he designated as the Alcansas). The explorer wrote he and nine other men, including three Caddo guides and 22 horses loaded with trade goods had come to a native settlement overlooking the river, where there were about 6,000 natives, who gave the strangers a warm welcome. La Harpe's party were honored with the calumet ceremony and spent ten days at this location. In 1988, evidence of a native village was discovered along the Arkansas River south of present-day Tulsa, Oklahoma. By then, the site was known as the Lasley Vore Site.Odell, George H. \\"Lasley Vore Site.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed January 26, 2017. French traders and trappers who had opened up trade with Indian tribes in Canada and the areas around the Great Lakes began exploring the Mississippi and some of its northern tributaries. They soon learned that the birchbark canoes, which had served them so well on the northern waterways, were too light for use on the southern rivers, such as the Arkansas. They turned to making and using dugout canoes, which they called pirogues, made by hollowing out the trunks of cottonwood trees. Cottonwoods are plentiful along the streams of the southwest and grow to large sizes. The wood is soft and easily worked with the crude tools carried by both the French and Indians. The pirogues were sturdier and could be more for navigating the sandbars and snags of the Southern waterways.Wright, Muriel H. \\"Early Navigation and Commerce along the Arkansas and Red Rivers in Oklahoma.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 8, Number 1, March, 1930. p. 65. Accessed September 29, 2017. In 1819, the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty set the Arkansas as part of the frontier between the United States and Spanish Mexico. This continued until the United States annexed Texas after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, in 1846. The treaty was made shortly after \\"Old Settler\\" Cherokees moved to near what became known as Webbers Falls on the Arkansas River. That area, then part of Arkansas Territory would become Indian Territory and later Oklahoma, was traditional territory of the Osage, leading to conflict and a treaty in 1828 but still unresolved by the time thousands of additional Cherokee refugees moved to the area during the Trail of Tears. By the time Fort Smith was established in 1817, larger capacity watercraft became available to transport goods up and down the Arkansas. These included flatboats (bateaus) and keelboats. Along with the pirogues, they transported piles of deer, bear, otter, beaver and buffalo skins up and down the river. Agricultural products such as corn, rice, dried peaches, beans, peanuts, snake root, sarsaparilla, ginseng had grown in economic importance. On March 31, 1820, the Comet became the first steamboat to successfully navigate part of the Arkansas River, reaching a place called Arkansas Post, about above the confluence of the Arkansas and the Mississippi Rivers.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District/ Mission/Navigation. Accessed June 2, 2017. In mid-April 1822, the Robert Thompson, towing a keelboat, was the first steamboat to navigate the Arkansas as far as Fort Smith. For five years, Fort Smith was known as the head of navigation for steamboats on the river. It lost the title to Fort Gibson in April 1832, when three steamboats, Velocipede, Scioto and Catawba, all arrived at Fort Gibson later that month. Later, the Santa Fe Trail followed the Arkansas through much of Kansas, picking it up near Great Bend and continuing through to La Junta, Colorado, unless users elected to take the challenging Cimarron Cutoff in Cimarron, Kansas.National Park Service =American Civil War= During the American Civil War, each side tried to prevent the other from using the Arkansas and its tributaries as a route for moving reinforcements. Initially, the Union Army abandoned its forts in the Indian Territory, including Fort Gibson and Fort Smith, in order to maximize its strength for campaigns elsewhere, while the Confederate Army sent troops from Texas to support its Native American allies. Union Troops returned later in the war, after defeating the Confederates at the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Battle of Fort Smith, and began recovering the position it had previously abandoned, most notably Fort Gibson, reopening the Arkansas River as a supply route. In September 1864, a body of Confederate irregulars led by General Stand Watie successfully ambushed a Union supply ship bound for Fort Gibson. The vessel was destroyed, and a part of its cargo was looted by the Confederates. =Post Civil War= In the 1880s, Charles \\"Buffalo\\" Jones, one of the cofounders of Garden City, Kansas, organized four irrigation companies to take water one hundred miles from the Arkansas River to cultivate of land.Charles Jesse \\"Buffalo\\" Jones exhibit, Finney County Historical Museum, Garden City, Kansas By 1890, water from the Arkansas was being used to irrigate more than of farmland in Kansas. By 1910, irrigation projects in Colorado had caused the river to stop flowing in July and August.\\"History of the Arkansas River (1540 to 2000)\\". South Central Service Cooperative. 2017. Accessed June 4, 2017. Flooding in 1927 severely damaged or destroyed nearly every levee downstream of Fort Smith, and led to the development of the Arkansas River Flood Control Association. It also led to the Federal Government assigning responsibility of flood control and navigation on the Arkansas to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE). Fly fishermen on the Arkansas River near Salida, Colorado Angling The headwaters of the Arkansas River in central Colorado have been known for exceptional trout fishing, particularly fly fishing, since the 19th century, when greenback cutthroat trout dominated the river. Today, brown trout dominate the river, which also contains rainbow trout. Trout Unlimited considers the Arkansas one of the top 100 trout streams in America, a reputation the river has had since the 1950s. From Leadville to Pueblo, the Arkansas River is serviced by numerous fly shops and guides operating in Buena Vista, Salida, Ca√±on City and Pueblo. The Colorado Division of Wildlife provides regular online fishing reports for the river.Colorado Division of Wildlife Fishing Reports A fish kill occurred on December 29, 2010, in which an estimated 100,000 freshwater drum lined the Arkansas River bank. An investigation, conducted by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, found the dead fish \\"... cover of river from the Ozark Lock and Dam downstream to River Mile 240, directly south of Hartman, Arkansas.\\" Tests later indicated the likely cause of the kill was gas bubble trauma caused by opening the spillways on the Ozark Dam.

Looking north along the gorge (8km south of the Russian checkpoint in North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania). The Darial Gorge (, Darialis Kheoba; ; , Arvykom; , D√§ra √Ñle; Chechen: –¢–µ—Ä–∫–∞–Ω —á”Ä–∞–∂, Terkan ch'azh) is a river gorge on the border between Russia and Georgia. It is at the east base of Mount Kazbek, south of present- day Vladikavkaz. The gorge was carved by the river Terek, and is approximately long. The steep granite walls of the gorge can be as much as tall in some places.  In history  The Darial originates from Dar-i AlƒÅn () meaning \\"Gate of the Alans\\" in Persian. The Alans held the lands north of the pass in the first centuries AD. It has been fortified in ancient times by the Romans and Persians; the fortification was variously known as the Iberian Gates or the Caucasian Gates. The pass is mentioned in the Georgian annals under the names of Darialani; Strabo calls it Porta Caucasica and Porta Cumana; Ptolemy, Fortes Sarmatica; it was sometimes known as Porta Caucasica and Portae Caspiae (a name bestowed also on the \\"gate\\" or pass beside the Caspian Sea at Derbent); and the Tatars call it Darioly. Josephus wrote that Alexander the Great built iron gates at an unspecified pass which some Latin and Greek authors identified with Darial.

There was a battle point between the Ilkhanate and the Golden Horde, then indirectly controlled by Safavids and Qajar state, until it was captured by Russian Empire after annexation of Kingdom of Georgia in 1801-1830. It remained a strategic Russian forepost under Russian control until the dismemberment of the Soviet Union.  Importance  The Darial Pass was historically important as one of only two crossings of the Caucasus mountain range, the other being the Derbent Pass. As a result, Darial Gorge has been fortified since at least 150 BC. Ruins of an ancient fortress are still visible. The pass served as a hub point for many roads connecting North and South Caucasus and remained open for traffic for most of its existence. The Russian fort, Darial, which guarded this section of the Georgian Military Road, was built at the northern end of the gorge, at an altitude of . The gorge has been immortalized in Russian poetry, notably by Lermontov in The Demon; it has become known as one of the most romantic places in the Caucasus.

It was written and directed by Helmut Dietl. Background In 1983, the German magazine Stern (Star) began to publish, with great fanfare. They were soon proven to be fake using basic analysis techniques. Co-writer and director Helmut Dietl researched the scandal for two years and was quoted as having to leave out several real events from the film because they were too outrageous. The title is a bow to Charlie Chaplin's classic The Great Dictator, in which the Tomainian dictator Adenoid Hynkel repeatedly uses \\"Schtonk!\\" as an expression of disgustthe word has no meaning in German.  Plot  Fritz Knobel (the film's alter-ego of real-life forger Konrad Kujau) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. He sells a portrait of Eva Braun and one volume of Hitler's alleged diaries to factory owner Karl Lenz. Lenz presents this to his guests during a \\"birthday party for the F√ºhrer\\", among whom is sleazy journalist Hermann Willi√©. Willi√© works for the magazine \\"HH press\\", which links to Hamburg (as a licence plate abbreviation), where the Stern magazine is located and also to the common abbreviation for \\"Heil Hitler\\" among neo-Nazis. Knobel writes the subsequent diaries based on what happens around him; after he meets Martha and she becomes his lover beside his wife Biggi, she also becomes his inspiration for Eva Braun in the diaries. The rumors about his work cause a major Nazi craze among the high society, allowing former Nazi officials to use openly their Nazi ranks (e.g. Obergruppenf√ºhrer). Willi√© becomes even more obsessed buying the old yacht Carin II of Hermann G√∂ring and starting an affair with his (fictional) grandniece Freya von Hepp. Towards the end, the plot has developed its own dynamics, putting more and more pressure on Knobel to deliver the remaining volumes while permanently fearing the uncovering of the forgery. The volumes are convincing enough to fool the enthusiastic journalists, who are willing to overlook some oddities, especially a false monogram \\"FH\\" instead of \\"AH\\" on one of the volumes. They even invent alternative facts for their explanation (the term \\"F√ºhrerhauptquartier\\" instead of \\"Adolf Hitler\\" for instance). Later Knobel manages to manipulate a forensic graphoanalysis to his advance but it seems only a matter of time until the truth is discovered. The constant fear and the struggle with a too close identification with the person he is writing about make Knobel collapse. His two spouses take over the initiative forcing him to pull himself out of the forgery business just in time, while the others fall, similar to the end of World War II, more or less hard according to their personal level of belief.

There are local ranger district offices in North Bend and Skykomish.USFS Ranger Districts by State  History  Mount Baker National Forest was established as the Washington Forest Reserve on February 22, 1897 with . It became a national forest on March 4, 1907 and was renamed Mount Baker National Forest on January 21, 1924. Snoqualmie National Forest was established from land in Washington NF on 1 July 1908 with 961,120 acres (3,889.52 km¬≤). A part of Rainier National Forest was added on October 19, 1933. The two were administratively combined in 1974. The 1935 version of The Call of the Wild with Clark Gable, Loretta Young and Jack Oakie was filmed on location in Mount Baker National Forest because Twentieth Century Pictures felt it was remote enough to guarantee lack of interruption from skiers and other forest visitors. Paramount Pictures later also filmed The Barrier at Mount Baker Lodge. Visitation The Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie National Forest covers (in descending order of forestland area) portions of Snohomish, Whatcom, Skagit, King, Pierce, and Kittitas counties. It has a total area of . The forest consists of four ranger districts. The following are listed geographically from north to south: the Mount Baker District has two ranger stations located in Glacier and Sedro-Woolley; the Darrington Ranger District has two ranger stations located in Darrington and Verlot; the Skykomish Ranger District has one ranger station located in Skykomish; and the Snoqualmie Ranger District has two ranger stations located in North Bend and Enumclaw. Together with the other central Puget Sound counties, 62% (3.63 million people) of the state's population lives within a drive of the forest. Another 1.5 million in the Vancouver metropolitan area are also within easy reach of the northern part of the forest. The large population factor, coupled with easy road access, makes the Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie National Forest the most visited national forest in the country. Geography =Mountains= The Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie National Forest contains many scenic and historical points of interest. Mountain tops gradually rise from on the south end of the forest to in the north. Two tall volcanoes, Mount Baker and Glacier Peak, tower thousands of feet above the adjacent ridges.

This is a part of the global phenomenon of glacier retreat. Forest glaciers have lost between 20 and 40% of their volume between 1984 and 2006. This is due to continued warm conditions and negative mass balance. White Chuck Glacier (Glacier Peak) is no longer on the list of large glaciers, above. It shrank from from 1958 to 2002. With the shrinking of the glaciers, summer glacial runoff has been reduced by 65 to 80%. This reduces streamflow and sediment and increases water temperature. Salmon and many other species are adversely affected by such changes. Twin Sisters Mountain in the Mount Baker Wilderness Conservation The north and east portions of the forest are exceptionally rugged and scenic. In 1968, part of the forest was transferred to the National Park Service to be within North Cascades National Park. A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the forest was . In addition, Congressional action since 1964 has established the following wilderness areas, which comprise ‚Äîalmost half of the forest's area: * Alpine Lakes Wilderness (mostly in Wenatchee NF) * Boulder River Wilderness * Clearwater Wilderness * Glacier Peak Wilderness (mostly in Wenatchee NF) * Henry M.

History The United States Congress originally passed the PES in 1792, under powers granted it in the United States Constitution to \\"establish Post Offices and Post Roads.\\" The PES granted the government the power for the carriage and delivery of letter mail. Today the USPS is empowered to suspend the PES, if it believes such a private postal service would be in the interests of the general public. The PES consists of and , implemented under 39 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 310 and 320. These restrict the carriage and delivery of letter mail by private organizations, except as described in the next section. The PES only cover \\"letters\\" and not other mailable items such as parcels or periodicals. Exceptions =\\"Extremely urgent\\" letters= In 1979 the Postal Service authorized the delivery of extremely urgent letters outside the USPS; this has given rise to delivery services such as Federal Express and UPS's express mail services. Records of pick up and delivery must be maintained for Postal Service inspection if the time sensitive exception is being used. =Lawful private carriage= It is possible to set up a private mail delivery service known as \\"lawful private carriage\\" if the USPS postage is paid in addition to any private postage fee that is collected. Records must be maintained that such postage has been paid, and it must be affixed to the letter cover by U.S. stamps, meter imprints or through another method approved by the USPS; the postage must be canceled by the sender in ink; the date of mailing must be affixed in ink to the cover (either by sender or carrier); and the letter cannot be removed without defacing the cover from the envelope or other container in which the letter is sent. An agreement must be entered into with the Postal Service to conduct volume private carriage through the Pricing and Classification Service Center.https://www.dmnews.com/marketing-channels/direct- mail/news/13076011/mailers-like-centralized-national-cases-division =Occasional private mail delivery= One does not need to establish a private mail delivery service for the occasional commercial transport of a letter outside the mails so long as the rate which would have been due to the USPS is affixed in stamps, the stamps are cancelled in ink, and the date of receipt by the carrier or the transport of the letter, are noted thereon. All these privately carried letters can bear a private cancellation if the cancellation is done in ink; private cancellations are different from private overprints on postage stamps. =Special messenger services= There are limited exceptions for special messenger services which deliver less than twenty-five letters for an individual or company per occasion. In such case no postage need be paid or affixed to the letters; pick up and delivery can be from private residences and commercial businesses. =Free delivery= The delivery of letters without compensation and without the affixation or payment of any postage is allowed under 39 CFR 310.3(c) by third parties, and under 39 CFR 310.3(b) for one's own letters which includes regular employees only delivering company mail. Thus, it is not a violation of the PES if one delivers a letter of one's friend even without affixation of postage or if a company has one of its regular employees deliver mail that originates from the company to its customers. Compensation is considered to include barter and goodwill. Thus an individual or business who receives a benefit for the delivery of letters does not fall under such a free carriage exception. For example, buying a friend dinner in exchange for having him deliver a letter is not considered without compensation; in such a case one would be required to affix and cancel a sufficient amount of postage to the letter. Another example not falling under this exception would be a business that is carrying letters \\"free of charge\\" in the hopes of building business or incidental to some other delivery as an accommodation for its customer; this use would also require the affixation and cancellation of a sufficient amount of postage to be in compliance with the PES. =Cargo delivery= There is an exception for the delivery of what otherwise would be considered a letter if it is sent with cargo and the letter is somehow incidental to the ordering, delivery or shipping of the cargo [39 CFR 310.3(a)]. =Other exceptions = Other exceptions to the PES include: * Letters that at some point during their pick- up or delivery had previously entered into the USPS mailstream, unless the letters are consolidated. * Letters addressed to specific persons that fall outside the purview of the PES. * Certain documents and objects that are not considered letters, even though containing a message.

Inspired to become a pilot by Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean, he became a booster of Chicago as a world center of aviation. He gave flying lessons to President Harry S. Truman. Life and career Meigs was born in Poweshiek County, Iowa, the son of Church Paddleford Meigs and Julianna S. (Burrell) Meigs. He grew up on a farm near Malcom, Iowa, where he was more interested in the mechanical devices used to raise crops than actually farming. In 1901, he took a job as a salesman for the J.I. Case Threshing Machine Company in Racine, Wisconsin. Within a year, he was in charge of the company's sales for South America. Despite not having graduated from high school, Meigs was allowed to enroll at the University of Chicago, where he played football under Amos Alonzo Stagg and also played baseball and water polo. He was the starting left guard of the 1905 University of Chicago national championship team .While at the college, he would also be the campus correspondent for the Chicago Herald and Examiner, of which he would become the executive later in his life. During World War II, Meigs served on the Office of Production Management as the aircraft expert. In time Meigs would become a senior vice president of the Hearst Corporation, publisher of the old Chicago American newspaper as well as becoming the head of the Chicago Aero Commission. Meigs insisted that in addition to Midway Airport (then called Municipal Airport) and O'Hare Field (then called Orchard- Douglas), the city needed an airfield within ten minutes of the Loop. It opened in December 1948 and was renamed Meigs Field in his honor the following year. Fifty-four years after the renaming, Meigs Field was demolished by order of then-Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley. Meigs retired in 1962 and became a consultant to the newspaper industry. He died at age 84. Sources *Meigs - The Man Who Loved to Fly, Reprinted from Friends of Meigs Field, Chicago, IL.

Biography Compay (meaning compadre) Segundo, so called because he was always second voice in his musical partnerships, was born in Siboney, Cuba, and moved to Santiago de Cuba at the age of nine. His first engagement was in the Municipal Band of Santiago de Cuba, directed by his teacher, Enrique Bueno. In 1934, after a spell in a quintet, he moved to Havana, where he also played the clarinet in the Municipal Band. He also learned to play the guitar and the tres, which became his usual instruments. Compay Segundo also invented the arm√≥nico, a seven-stringed guitar-like instrument, to fill the harmonic jump between the Spanish guitar and the tres.\\"Compay Segundo\\", AfroCubaWeb. In the 1950s he became well known as the second voice and tres player in Los Compadres, a duo he formed with Lorenzo Hierrezuelo in 1947.Orovio, Helio, Cuban music from A to Z, Duke University Press Books, 2004, p. 176. Los Compadres were one of the most successful Cuban duos of their time. Greater international fame came later, in 1997, with the release of the Buena Vista Social Club album, a hugely successful recording which won several Grammy awards. Compay Segundo appeared in the Wim Wenders film of the same title. Segundo's most famous composition is \\"Chan Chan\\", the opening track on the Buena Vista Social Club album, a four-chord son cubano. \\"Chan Chan\\" was recorded by Segundo himself various times as well as by countless other Latin artists. Other compositions are \\"Sarandonga\\", \\"La calabaza\\", \\"Hey caramba\\", \\"Macusa\\", \\"Saludo Compay\\". These are all sones, and this differentiates him from the more usual trova musicians, with their devotion to the bolero. However, it seems his interests went much further: :I have danzones, waltzes, sones. I have some beautiful danzones. Why? Because I've learned from those who know how to preserve the tradition of the music. I play music the way it was played in yesteryear. I started out playing the son corto (short son). As Miguel Matamoros used to say, \\"The son is short and sweet.\\"... Back in the day, they'd start out playing son at seven in the evening, and they'd greet the dawn with it. At a fiesta he sang to President Fidel Castro, who took his pulse and joked about his vitality despite his 90-plus years. \\"Who could have imagined that?\\" he asked when he found himself at the Vatican City, performing \\"Chan Chan\\" before Pope John Paul II. He explained his longevity simply: mutton consomm√© and a drink of rum. He predicted that he would live to be 115, but died of kidney failure in Havana, 18 years short of his ambition. The tomb of Compay Segundo at the Cementerio de Santa Ifigenia in Santiago de Cuba. March 2014 In 2007, the 100th anniversary of Segundo's birth was celebrated with a concert of his compositions performed by a symphony orchestra in Havana with some of his musicians and sons.

Kazbegi is also the second-highest volcanic summit in the Caucasus, after Mount Elbrus. The summit lies directly to the west of the town of Stepantsminda and is the most prominent geographic feature of the area. Mount Kazbek is the highest peak of Eastern Georgia. The name in Georgian, Mqinvartsveri, translates to \\"Glacier Peak\\" or \\"Freezing Cold Peak\\".\\"·Éõ·Éß·Éò·Éú·Éï·Éê·É†·Éò\\", Donald Rayfield et al., A Comprehensive Georgian- English Dictionary (2006) The Vainakh name Bashlam translates as \\"Molten Mount\\". Location Kazbegi is located on the Khokh Range, a mountain range which runs north of the Greater Caucasus Range, and which is pierced by the gorges of the Ardon and the Terek. At its eastern foot runs the Georgian Military Road through the pass of Darial 2,378 meters (7,805 feet). The mountain itself lies along the edge of the Borjomi‚ÄìKazbegi Fault (which is a northern sub-ending of the North Anatolian Fault). The region is highly active tectonically, with numerous small earthquakes occurring at regular intervals. An active geothermal/hot spring system also surrounds the mountain. Kazbek is a potentially active volcano, built up of trachyte and sheathed with lava, and has the shape of a double cone, whose base lies at an altitude of 1,770 meters (5,800 feet). Kazbek is the highest of the volcanic cones of the Kazbegi volcanic group which also includes Mount Khabarjina (3,142 metres). Owing to the steepness of its slopes, the glaciers of Kazbek are not very large. The total combined area of all of Kazbek's glaciers is 135 km¬≤. The best-known glacier is the Dyevdorak (Devdaraki), which creeps down the north-eastern slope into a gorge of the same name, reaching a level of 2,295 meters (7,530 feet). Kazbegi's other glaciers include the Mna, Denkara, Gergeti, Abano, and Chata. The recent collapse of the Kolka Glacier, located in a valley between Mt. Jimara and Kazbegi in the year 2002 was attributed to solfatara volcanic activity along the northern slope of the mountain, although there was no eruption. In addition to the 2002 event, a massive collapse of the Devdaraki Glacier on the mountain's northeastern slope which occurred on August 20, 2014, led to the death of seven people. The glacier collapse dammed the Terek River in the Daryal Gorge and flooded the Georgian Military Highway. From 24 to 28 May 2019 Caucasus skitouring network organize expedition to survey Mt. Kazbegi height. On 27 May 2019 at 12:22 GMT+4, for the first time, a survey team placed a GPS receiver on the Mt. Kazbegi peak. The new height is defined with the WGS 84 datum. Height was determinate with 5mm accuracy. Defined height is 5053.927m. Legend Mount Kazbek from the outside of the Gergeti Trinity Church Mount Kazbegi is associated in Georgian folklore with Amirani, the Georgian version of Prometheus, who was chained on the mountain in punishment for having stolen fire from the gods and giving it to mortals. The location of his imprisonment later became the site of an Orthodox hermitage located in a cave called \\"Betlemi\\" (Bethlehem) at approximately the 4,000-meter level. According to legends, this cave housed many sacred relics, including Abraham's tent and the manger of the infant Jesus. 19th-century postcard of the Georgian Military Road near Mount Kazbegi The summit was first climbed in 1868 by D. W. Freshfield, A. W. Moore, and C. Tucker of the Alpine Club, with the guide Fran√ßois Devouassoud. They were followed by female Russian alpinist Maria Preobrazhenskaya, who made the climb nine times starting in 1900. Kazbegi nature reserve The area around Mount Kazbegi was designated a nature reserve by the Soviet government in 1979, and includes beech forests, subalpine forests and alpine meadows. Many of the plants and animals in the reserve are endemic to the Caucasus region.

Procmail is stable, but no longer maintained, and a number of security vulnerabilities have been discovered since its last release. Users are advised by procmail's last maintainer, Philip Guenther, to use an alternative tool, because procmail is not suited for MIME traffic. Replacements Procmail was an early example of a mail filtering tool and language. Procmail is no longer maintained, and is known to have multiple security vulnerabilities. Despite this it still remains in wide use as the security issues are not widely known, migration can be difficult, especially for those who have complex filters developed over years, and some see its capabilities as better than available alternatives. * fdm (fetch, filter and deliver mail) is an ISC licensed replacement for fetchmail and procmail, written and maintained by an OpenBSD/tmux developer, originally written/released in 2006/2007 * dovecot-pigeonhole from Dovecot, an implementation of the Sieve language * maildrop, included as part of Courier Mail Server, but available for use with other servers, too * Sieve mail filtering language Invocation The procmail mail delivery agent is generally not started from the command line, but is usually invoked by mail delivery subsystems, such as a mail transport agent (like Sendmail or Postfix), or from a mail retrieval agent (such as fetchmail). This makes the mail processing event-driven. The companion tool formail allows procmail to be used in batch-processing on mail that already is in a user's mailbox. Paradigm Procmail is a data-driven programming language, similar to earlier line-oriented languages such as sed and AWK: it specifies conditions to match and actions to take on matching, in the form of \\"recipes\\". This approach has been followed by later languages such as maildrop and sieve. Recipes The procmail agent uses recipes to determine where to deliver the various mail messages. =Elements of a recipe= Each recipe that procmail uses consists of: * mode * conditions * action =Recipes can be conditional or unconditional= Recipes used by procmail can be conditional or unconditional. If the conditions are left out, the recipe is unconditional. =Types of recipes= Procmail has two kinds of recipes: * Delivering recipes * Non-delivering recipes =Processing of recipes= Recipes are read from top to bottom. The first delivering recipe terminates the delivery process (unless the mode flag specifies otherwise). Conditions Conditions are usually extended regular expressions, although there are other forms of condition also. Basic operation The procmail tool reads mail messages given to it from standard input. The procmail tool will process the recipes before distributing the mail messages into the appropriate mailboxes. Pitfalls By default, procmail will \\"bounce\\" undeliverable mail back to the sender. New users should be warned not to test new delivery recipes by running procmail on their existing mailboxes, since this could result in error messages being sent to all one's email contacts. Other operations Other common operations carried out with procmail include filtering and sorting of emails into different folders according to keywords in from, to, subject, text of the mail, or sending autoreplies, but more sophisticated operations are also possible. =Spam filtering= A common practice is to let procmail call an external spam filter program, such as SpamAssassin. This method can allow for spam to be filtered or even deleted. = Managing mailing lists = The procmail developers have built a mailing list manager called SmartList on top of procmail.

It spawned The Bard's Tale series of games and books. The Bard's Tale was noteworthy among other role-playing computer games at the time for its unprecedented 3D graphics and partly animated character portraits. It was originally released for the Apple II, and was also ported to the Commodore 64, Apple IIgs, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Macintosh, and NES platforms. In August 2018, a remastered version was released for Microsoft Windows, followed by the Xbox One release in 2019. Plot The following text from the box cover summarizes the premise: > Long ago, when magic still prevailed, the evil wizard Mangar the Dark > threatened a small but harmonious country town called Skara Brae. Evil > creatures oozed into Skara Brae and joined his shadow domain. Mangar froze > the surrounding lands with a spell of Eternal Winter, totally isolating > Skara Brae from any possible help. Then, one night the town militiamen all > disappeared. The future of Skara Brae hung in the balance. And who was left > to resist? Only a handful of unproven young Warriors, junior Magic Users, a > couple of Bards barely old enough to drink, and some out of work Rogues. You > are there. You are the leader of this ragtag group of freedom fighters. > Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your glories, if you survive. For > this is the stuff of legends. And so the story begins... The introduction depicts a bard sitting in a tavern. Between occasional sips from his mug, he strums a lute and sings: > The song I sing Will tell the tale : of a cold and wintery day; Of castle > walls And torchlit halls : And a price men had to pay. When evil fled And > brave men bled : The Dark one came to stay, 'Til men of old For blood and > gold : Had rescued Skara Brae. In the actual game, the player forms a group of up to six characters. Game progress is made through advancing the characters so that they are powerful enough to defeat the increasingly dangerous foes and monsters in the dungeons, obtaining certain items relevant to solving the overall quest, and obtaining information. The (fictional) town of Skara Brae consists of 30x30 map tiles containing either buildings or streets (plus gates and magical guardian statues blocking certain streets). Access to one tower in the northeastern and southwestern city corner each is blocked by locked gates. The main city gates which open to the west are blocked by snow, and remain impassable throughout the game. One street seems to lead south endlessly, by actually teleporting the party back to its beginning upon reaching the portion where the city walls would be. Certain buildings within the city are special, such as the Adventurer's Guild, Garth's Equipment Shoppe, the Review Board (which is unmarked and must be found first, and is the only place where characters can advance in experience levels), various taverns and temples, and the dungeons. The latter are mazes of various kinds--cellars, sewers, catacombs, or fortresses--full of monsters and riddles, some guarded by magical statues that come to life to attack trespassing player parties. # The first dungeon is the Wine Cellar (1 level) of one particular tavern, which turns out to be connected to the Sewers of Skara Brae (3 levels) that in turn feature an exit that leads to the otherwise inaccessible southwestern corner of the city where Mangar's Tower, the final dungeon, is located. The tower cannot be entered without a key, however. In the sewers, numerous hints are found, including the name of the Mad God. Finding this first dungeon (the Wine Cellar) required the party to order some wine at a certain tavern. There was a hint to this in the manual (Hint: The first dungeon is the wine cellar of the only tavern in town which serves wine. It's on Rakhir Street). However, this hint was not present in the manual included with the C64 release of the game. Upon ordering wine, the party would be sent by the bartender to his cellar to fetch a bottle themselves. It is not actually possible within the game to obtain a bottle of wine, nor is it required to proceed. The purpose of this introductory dungeon was simply to introduce the dungeon concept and provide access to the sewers. # The undead-infested Catacombs (3 levels) beneath the temple of the Mad God, accessible only if his name is known (but not technically requiring the party to have found this password themselves; it just needs to be typed in by the player regardless of how they came to possess this information). On the lowest level, a Lich must be defeated to obtain an eye. # If they possess the eye, a statue of the Mad God in Baron Harkyn's Castle (3 levels) will teleport the party to the (otherwise inaccessible) northeastern area of Skara Brae where the next dungeon is located; however, it is not required to proceed to the next dungeon immediately. If weakened too much from the fighting in the castle, the party may elect to leave the area via one-way portals instead at this point and return to the city and the Adventurer's Guild. # Kylearan's Tower (1 level) can only be reached through the teleporter in Harkyn's Castle, requiring any party who wishes to enter to fight through the castle's three levels first. Kylearan the Archmage awaits the party at the conclusion of his tower maze and turns out to be friendly. He gives the party an access key to Mangar's Tower, the final dungeon, but they still have to circumvent the locked gates around the tower by going through the Sewers. # Still reachable only via the Sewers at this point in the game, Mangar's Tower (5 levels) is the final dungeon that has to be overcome to reach Mangar and slay him, provided the party has acquired several items in the other dungeons which are required to best him. At one point within the tower, the party can acquire a key that will allow them to access Mangar's Tower and Kylearan's Tower from the city directly thenceforward, without having to move through the Sewers or Harkyn's Castle, respectively. Gameplay alt= A screenshot of The Bard's Tale on the Apple IIGS. The Bard's Tale is a straightforward dungeon crawl. The objective is to gain experience and advance characters' skills through (mostly) random combat with enemies and monsters. This is done while exploring maze-like dungeons, solving occasional puzzles and riddles, and finding or buying better weapons, armor, and other equipment. When beginning the game, the player may create up to six player characters, chosen from among the following classes: bard, hunter, monk, paladin, rogue, warrior, magician, and conjurer. The classes sorcerer and wizard were available to experienced conjurers and magicians. On some platforms, the player could import previously created characters from Wizardry and/or Ultima III, which was somewhat revolutionary at the time. Of particular innovation to the genre was the bard, whose magical songs functioned like long-lasting spells and affected the player's party in various ways--such as strengthening their armor, or increasing their attack speed, much like \\"buffs\\" in modern-day RPGs. A number of obligatory puzzles in the game were unsolvable without the use of bard songs. Each bard song triggered corresponding music while he played (some classical, some original). Magic users were allowed to change classes permanently. The game manual describes a magic user who has mastered all spells from all four classes as \\"an Archmage, the most powerful being in the world of The Bard's Tale.\\" However, Archmage status had no effect on gameplay other than simply having all spells available. Casting one of the 85 magic user spells consisted of typing a four-letter code found only in the printed game manual. However, when using a mouse (in the DOS, Amiga, and Macintosh versions), the full names of the spells would appear in a list to choose from. Combat is turn-based, described in text rather than shown graphically; there is no notion of moving characters around on a map during combat. Cash and experience points are distributed evenly to all surviving party members after a particular encounter is won. Cluebook Publisher Electronic Arts published a cluebook for the game in 1986 () that added some original characters and background information to the game's setting. Written by T.L. Thompson, it purports to be an in-universe document that one Pellis, who seems to be an influential individual working against Mangar behind the scenes, entrusts to an unnamed friend who has just come of age: implicitly, the player (party). It is the journal of Lord Garrick, viscount of Skara Brae's sister city Hamelon. Trapped in Skara Brae by Mangar's spell, Lord Garrick and his party of servants and associates (including Corfid op Orfin the Bard, Ghaklah the Magician, Isli the Paladin, Soriac the Archmage, and the otherwise unnamed \\"last of the great sage-sorcerors\\") take it upon themselves to rid Skara Brae of Mangar's influence. The journal narrates how they navigate the dungeons and solve the puzzles until, one step short of actually confronting Mangar, they find that crucial items were stolen by the party's Rogue when he had abandoned them. Soriac prepares a spell that will allow Isli to escape and give the journal to Pellis, but is also thought to rent from the fabric of time everything they have accomplished, and will consume Isli as well as it burn itself out. Development Michael Cranford developed the concept, design, and programming of The Bard's Tale and its successor game (The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight), with additional design by Brian Fargo (the founder of Interplay) and Roe Adams III. David Lowery designed the graphics, Lawrence Holland composed the music, and Joe Ybarra served as producer. Cranford is a devout Christian. He included references to Jesus Christ in The Bard's Tale, and all but one of the city names in The Bard's Tale II are taken from the New Testament. After a falling-out with Brian Fargo, he was not involved in The Bard's Tale III and decided to go back to college to study philosophy and theology instead. Lawrence Holland, who composed the music and programmed the music interface for The Bard's Tale, went on to create the renowned Star Wars: X-Wing series of games for LucasArts. He later founded his own game company, Totally Games. Artist Eric Joyner painted the original cover art, which featured himself (foreground, vest), artist Don Carson III (foreground with mug and background with pipe), and Carson's father Don Carson Jr (harp) as models. Rebecca Heineman, who worked at Interplay at the time (then as Bill \\"Burger\\" Heineman), is credited in the game's manual for the \\"data compressing routines that allowed [Cranford] to pack so much graphics and animation\\", and according to herself also wrote development tools for the game such as a graphic editor and all ports to other platforms. Heineman became openly critical of Cranford in later years, saying in an interview that Cranford, after doing some last bugfixes, held the game's final version \\"hostage\\" to force Brian Fargo to sign a publishing contract that contained a clause by which the sequel game (The Destiny Knight) would be Cranford's alone. Brian Fargo confirmed this, but still defended Cranford. Cranford in turn called Heineman's words \\"disparaging slant\\" and \\"fiction\\", noting that Heineman (\\"a storyteller with an agenda\\") at the time was (paraphrased) a loner who \\"sat isolated in a cubicle in the back corner of the room\\", wasn't involved in the company's business operations, nor deeply involved in The Bard's Tale, and therefore would not know all the details.RPG Codex.net interview with Michael CranfordForum posting by Michael Cranford, explaining his point of view As far as he (Cranford) could remember the situation, Brian Fargo would not produce a written contract for the game until near the very end of the development, and then only under pressure from Cranford withholding the final product. When he finally did, the contract was not what Cranford thought they had verbally agreed on when he had started working on the project, nor something he felt he could or would have agreed to at the onset. Although a compromise was found, Fargo asked Cranford to leave the company after The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight was finished. The experience contributed to Cranford walking away from game development to pursue a different career. Cranford said he later apologized to Fargo after learning that the attorney who had represented him had misrepresented several other cases to his clients and had apparently misled him into assuming the worst. Cranford, Fargo, and Heineman have all since stated that they hold no grudges against each other over something that occurred when they were in their early twenties. Cranford and Fargo remain friends. When Fargo, through his firm inXile Entertainment, started making The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep on the original game's 30th anniversary, Cranford was invited to join the project and did contribute, while Heineman offered to create a 'remastered' edition of the original three games for modern operating systems (see below). Reception  =Critical reception= Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia in 1985 described Bard's Tale as \\"not to be missed!\\" In 1993 she criticized the game's starting difficulty and single save location, but stated that it had \\"many points of interest, particularly in the puzzles, and is definitely a game worth getting\\". The game was reviewed in 1986 in Dragon #116 by Hartley and Pattie Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers rated the game well, concluding that \\"Bard‚Äôs Tale, a game of high adventure ... is one we recommend for your software library.\\" The game was revisited in Dragon #120. In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Calling the Commodore 64 version wondrous, Compute!'s Gazette in 1986 stated that while the game's plot and gameplay did not vary from the norm, \\"its depth of concept and brilliance of execution\\" did. Praising the complex magic system, the magazine concluded that \\"the greatest danger is not Mangar‚Äîit's the likelihood that you'll never be able to tear yourself away from this masterpiece of a game\\". Compute! in 1987 called the Apple IIGS version \\"unquestionably the most graphically stunning product I have seen on any Apple computer\\". The ZX Spectrum version of The Bard's Tale, released in 1988, was favorably received. CRASH said that \\"the Skara Brae environment is so complex and involves so many different factors that it's hard not to get completely enthralled in your quest\\" and rated it at 86%. Sinclair User rated it at 89%, but noted that it would not appeal to general gameplayers, saying that \\"The Bard's Tale will enthrall diehard pixie fans [...] but there's too much text, and not enough graphics and animation, to convert the uncommitted.\\" Your Sinclair were similarly positive about the game, rating it 9/10. Macworld reviewed the Macintosh version of The Bard's Tale, praising the music and gameplay, calling it a \\"Nice combination of problem solving, combat, and exploration\\", but criticizing the monochrome graphics and repetitive gameplay, the latter largely directed towards frequent combat. The Commodore 64 version of The Bard's Tale was given a 'Sizzler' award and rated at 94% by ZZAP! 64 magazine, in the 1986 Christmas Special edition. Reviewer Sean Masterson called it \\"the best RPG on the Commodore\\". With a score of 7.49 out of 10, in 1988 The Bard's Tale was among the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, honoring those games rated highly over time by readers. In 1990 the game received the seventh-highest number of votes in a survey of readers' \\"All-Time Favorites\\". In 1996, the magazine named The Bard's Tale the 89th best game ever. =Commercial performance= The Bard's Tale was very successful, becoming the best-selling computer RPG of the 1980s at 407,000 copies. It was the first non-Wizardry computer role-playing game to challenge the Ultima series' sales, especially to Commodore 64 users who could not play Wizardry (a Commodore version did not appear until 1987, with inferior graphics to that of The Bard's Tale). By 1993, over a million copies of the game had been sold. Legacy =Sequels= A magazine advertisement for The Bard's Tale. The Bard's Tale was both a best-seller and a critical success, and produced two official sequels and a \\"Construction Set\\" in its time. *The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight (1986) *The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate (1988) *The Bard's Tale Construction Set (1991) A compilation of all three classic The Bard's Tale games, entitled The Bard's Tale Trilogy, was released for DOS by Electronic Arts in 1990. According to programmer Rebecca Heineman, the name of the overall series was to be Tales of the Unknown, and the three games were to be entitled The Bard's Tale, The Archmage's Tale, and The Thief's Tale. This is supported by the cover art of the original Bard's Tale release, which proclaimed the game as \\"Tales of the Unknown, Volume I.\\" However, the immense popularity of the first game prompted Electronic Arts to re-brand the series under the more well-known name. Michael Cranford, however, stated that an Electronic Arts agent they worked with had come up with the city name (Skara Brae, named after a real-life settlement in prehistoric Orkney) and the game's title, The Bard's Tale (from originally: Tale of the Scarlet Bard), and that The Destiny Knight was never going to be called The Archmage's Tale.According to his GDC 2018: Classic Game Postmortem: 'The Bard's Tale I and II' presentation (around the 31:32 mark) What was originally going to be The Bard's Tale IV became an unrelated game called Dragon Wars (1991) at a very late point in its development process, due to rights issues after developer Interplay parted ways with publisher Electronic Arts.Rebecca Heineman Interview. Digit Press, 2006. The game's name and storyline were changed to disassociate it from the Bard's Tale series. In 2003, Brian Fargo (who created maps for the first two Bard's Tale games and directed the third) left Interplay Entertainment and began a new game development company named InXile Entertainment. In 2004, they released their first game, also titled The Bard's Tale, an unrelated, console-style, top-down, action RPG which pokes fun at traditional, fantasy, and role-playing game tropes as in those found throughout the original Bard's Tale. It was not a proper sequel to the classic series, nor was it connected in any respect apart from the title and location: the story takes place on the Orkney Mainland, where the ruins of real-world Skara Brae lie. Although a legal loophole allowed InXile to use the Bard's Tale name, and the company had evidently planned to incorporate more elements of the original games, Electronic Arts still owned the original trademarks for the Bard's Tale series itself, and InXile was not legally allowed to use any of the plot, characters, or locations featured in the original trilogy in their 2004 game. In May 2015, Fargo announced that he was planning to develop and a sequel funded through crowdfunding on Kickstarter, The Bard's Tale IV. The game, which was released in 2018, continues the storyline of the original trilogy but has significantly changed gameplay. The Mage's Tale was published by InXile in 2017 as a spinoff game using virtual reality technology. It was developed concurrently with The Bard's Tale IV. =Remastered Edition= During the Kickstarter campaign to create a proper fourth installment to the series, inXile partnered with Rebecca Heineman and her company Olde Sk√º√ºl to remaster the original trilogy for modern personal computers running Mac OS and Microsoft Windows (instead of the emulated versions offered by inXile). After reaching an impasse in development, Olde Sk√º√ºl and inXile agreed to transfer the project to Krome Studios. Krome Studios and inXile released the remastered edition on 14 August 2018, as part of the remastered The Bard's Trilogy. The Remastered Edition essentially re-wrote the original games, keeping only the storyline and gameplay design but little if any of the original game code. Graphics, sound, and user interface were updated to modern standards, various bugs were fixed, and a unified authoritative gameplay was devised when it turned out that there were significant differences not only between parts I, II, and III of the original trilogy (such as the number of characters in the party or spells being available at different levels, or not available at all, in different installments), but also between ports of the same game. Some content was added, including female character portraits and (inconsequential) references to the Bard's Tale IV storyline. The remastered edition of the original trilogy was released for Xbox One on 13 August 2019. This followed the acquisition of inXile Entertainment by Microsoft. The collection supports Xbox Play Anywhere. =Novels= A series of novels based on The Bard's Tale were published by Baen Books during the 1990s. Although the books had little in common with the storyline of the games, their existence is a testament to how influential the Bard's Tale brand had become. They include: #Castle of Deception, by Mercedes Lackey and Josepha Sherman (1992, ) #Fortress of Frost and Fire, by Mercedes Lackey and Ru Emerson (1993, ) #Prison of Souls, by Mercedes Lackey and Mark Shepherd (1994, ) #The Chaos Gate, by Josepha Sherman (1994, ) #Thunder of the Captains, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1996, ) #Wrath of the Princes, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1997, ) #Escape from Roksamur, by Mark Shepherd (1997, ) #Curse of the Black Heron, by Holly Lisle (1998, ) While they are listed here in the order they were published, some books in the series connect more than others, such as Castle of Deception and The Chaos Gate, Prison of Souls and Escape from Roksamur, and Thunder of the Captains and Wrath of the Princes.

The northern, urbanized end of the valley is part of a region locally known as the \\"South Bay\\" and also part of the electronics, research, and technology area known as Silicon Valley. Santa Clara Valley consists of most of Santa Clara County, including its county seat, San Jose, as well as a small portion of San Benito County. The valley, named after the Spanish Mission Santa Clara, was for a time known as the Valley of Heart's Delight for its high concentration of orchards, flowering trees, and plants. Until the 1960s it was the largest fruit-producing and packing region in the world, with 39 canneries.Valley of Heart's Delight : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive.

Overview \\"Valley of the Heart's Delight\\", mid 20th century Once primarily agricultural because of its highly fertile soil, Santa Clara Valley is now largely urbanized, although its far southern reaches south of Gilroy remain agrarian. The most northern urban areas are considered part of Silicon Valley. As Silicon Valley is not an actual valley, parts of the San Francisco Peninsula farther north are included in the Silicon Valley region as well. Locally, the urbanized areas of Santa Clara Valley are also referred to as part of the South Bay. Few traces of its agricultural past can still be found, but the Santa Clara Valley American Viticultural Area remains a large wine-making region. It was one of the first commercial wine-producing regions in California (and possibly the United States), utilizing high-quality French varietal vines imported from France.Santa Clara.

The northern end of the Santa Clara Valley is at the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay, and the southern end is in the vicinity of Hollister. The valley is bounded by the Santa Cruz Mountains on the southwest, which separate the valley from the Pacific Ocean, and by the Diablo Range on the northeast. The valley is approximately long by wide. Its largest city, by an 86.7% margin, is San Jose. The population of the valley is 1.81 million people along with approximately 865,700 wage and salary jobs. Santa Clara Valley has a Mediterranean semi-arid climate. Joseph S. Diller, a geologist, observed in 1915 that a \\"notable peculiarity\\" of the Santa Clara Valley is that \\"it is divided transversely by a scarcely noticeable soil-covered divide.\\" The northern portion is drained northward by various rivers and creeks into San Francisco Bay. The southern portion of the valley is drained southward by Llagas Creek into the Pajaro River, which in turn flows westward to Monterey Bay. As one travels across the valley floor, \\"the alluvial plain is continuous across the divide.\\" The summit of the transverse divide is about two miles from the former town of Madrone at elevation 345 feet (105 meters), but the alluvial plain is so continuous that most travelers are unaware they are crossing between two drainage basins. History The earliest inhabitants on the Santa Clara Valley are the Ohlone people, who had eight distinct languages and tribes in the coastal region. Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s, which had control over a vast tract of land stretching from Palo Alto to Gilroy, was founded by Franciscans in 1777. San Jose was California's first town and was also founded in 1777 by Spain as an agricultural pueblo. There were 66 original settlers. In Spanish and Mexican times the land was devoted to cattle, as was most of California. Following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War San Jose was briefly the Capital of California. The influx of Americans resulted in relocation of many of the native Mexican and Indian people of San Jose to the mission at Santa Clara, which had been under control of Jesuits from 1850; they founded Santa Clara University there in 1851. In 1860, as an American town, the population of San Jose was 4,579, with cattle ranching still the main agricultural activity. For a time wheat became the main crop, but in the 1870s fruit gradually became the main crop and processing of fruit by drying or canning the predominant industry. The railroad reached San Jose in 1860. =The Valley of Heart's Delight= Libby Water Tower, a heritage landmark in Sunnyvale The valley with its scenic beauty, mild climate, and thousands of acres of blooming fruit trees was known as \\"The Valley of Heart's Delight\\". Various fruit cooperatives were formed in the area to deal with economic issues, including The California Fruit Union (founded in 1883) and the Santa Clara County Fruit Exchange (founded in 1892). Prunes were a major crop, the valley was producing the majority of prunes in California by 1900 and they were shipped internationally. Water was supplied from an artesian aquifer and when the water table dropped, wells were pumped. Many orchards were small with housing and fruit growing in a dispersed pattern. By the 1920s and 1930s, the agricultural and horticultural industries were doing well in the valley and included 18 canneries, 13 dried-fruit packing houses, and 12 fresh-fruit and vegetable shipping firms, and they were shipping internationally. Del Monte and Sunsweet are two brands which originated in the Santa Clara Valley. The need for workers greatly exceeded the local population and in the nineteenth century, Chinese and Japanese immigrants met that need. Toward the end of the nineteenth century many Italians and other immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe came to the valley and worked in the orchards and canneries. During the 20th century there were Filipino immigrants and increasing numbers of immigrants from Mexico who during World War II became the dominant agricultural workforce. The town of San Jose was dominated by its business community, which was in part composed of Irish Catholics, who had a self-contained social life which did not include immigrant labor. There was marked prejudice against Asians, particularly Chinese, who gradually left the valley. =The Great Depression= Deflation and overproduction severely hurt the orchards and packers of the Santa Clara Valley during the Great Depression. Bankrupt farmers from the Dust Bowl, the Okies, made the trek to California. Desperate to feed their families they joined a workforce that was itself impacted by unemployment. The growers, with record low prices and surplus supply, could pay little. Labor organizers and goon squads battled in the labor camps.Kate Bronfenbrenner, \\"California Farmworkers' Strikes of 1933\\", pages 79-83 in Labor conflict in the United States: An encyclopedia, edited by R. L. Filippelli, Garland Publishing, Inc. (1990) Woody Guthrie's songs were on the radio and he wrote a regular column in the San Francisco-based The Daily People's World. San Francisco had a strong labor union tradition which extended to Santa Clara County. During the \\"March Inland\\" organizing drive the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) backed the Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union (CAWIU), a Communist-controlled union headquartered in San Jose, which had considerable success organizing farm and cannery workers in the Santa Clara Valley and elsewhere in California until it was suppressed and its leaders jailed in 1934 by the State of California following sustained attacks by business, political and reactionary forces which, in San Jose, resulted in an atmosphere of terror (the low point of which was a public lynching tacitly supported by James Rolph, the Governor of California). The canneries, with a segregated seasonal work force of white women, were eventually organized, at first by an AFL-affiliated company union, but one which gradually evolved, thanks to rank and file efforts, into a union which genuinely represented cannery workers. =War and industry= The fruit industry gradually recovered and by the early 1940s prosperity returned to the valley. Wartime production associated with World War II brought industry to the valley such as building of marine engines for Liberty ships by the Joshua Hendy Iron Works, an historic mining and mill machinery manufacturer, now Northrop Grumman Marine Systems in Sunnyvale, landing craft were built by Food Machinery Corporation (FMC later built the M113 (APC) Armored Personnel Carrier and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle as well as the XR311 at its facility in Santa Clara), and an IBM factory began manufacturing punch cards in San Jose in 1943. About 1,000 Japanese were interned, losing substantial property. Wartime production drew workers, including women, from the orchards and canneries; they were replaced by Mexican Americans from Texas and California and by Mexican braceros. Neighborhoods in East San Jose, such as the Meadowfair district, became barrios. The Polaris missile was a Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) built during the Cold War by Lockheed Missiles & Space Division in Sunnyvale for the United States Navy while Northrop Grumman Marine Systems built the launch tubes and propulsion systems. For the most part the defense industries and traditional electronics manufacturers, with the exception of IBM, in the Santa Clara Valley were unionized, mainly by International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and Teamsters. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, a communist dominated union, but friendly to minority and women workers, gradually lost its place during the McCarthy era. In the 1950s the transistor industry was established which led, together with Xerox and Stanford University research and the Digital Revolution, to the Valley becoming Silicon Valley, a premier electronic technology center. =Silicon Valley= Silicon Valley is traditionally known as the entirety of Santa Clara County, as well as southern San Mateo County and southern Alameda county, however the boundaries of the Silicon Valley region have expanded over the years. In the 1970s, this region had a clustering of semiconductor companies, which is how it got its name. =San Jose= In 1950 Dutch Hamann was appointed city manager of San Jose. Hamann's boosterism was supported by Joe Ridder, publisher of the San Jose Mercury. In power until 1969, Hamann created a master plan for San Jose and embarked on a program of annexation that increased the area of San Jose from 17 square miles to 136.7 square miles. The main bargaining chip was the superior sewage system built to handle cannery waste. To overcome resistance by school districts, who otherwise would have lost their tax base, annexed areas were allowed to maintain independent school districts. This resulted in some parts of the city such as East San Jose having low-quality segregated school systems with a low tax base while school systems in other parts of San Jose have an ample tax base and high-quality schools. The population of San Jose increased from 95 thousand in 1950 to 446 thousand in 1970. There were critics: Santa Clara County Planning Director Karl Belser, who opposed urban sprawl, commented. \\"Perhaps the only use we will ever find for the hydrogen bomb will be to erase this great mistake from the face of the earth.\\" Housing for each additional 1000 people took 257 acres of land. =Schools= Funding for public schools in upscale communities in the Santa Clara Valley is often supplemented by grants from private foundations set up for that purpose and funded by local residents. Schools in less favorable demographics must depend on state funding. Cities and towns Looking west, across the valley, from Alum Rock Park over northern San Jose (downtown is at far left) and other parts of the valley. The valley runs north to south in the picture. Cities and towns in the Santa Clara Valley include (in alphabetical order): *Campbell *Cupertino *Gilroy *Hollister *Los Gatos *Los Altos *Los Altos Hills *Milpitas *Monte Sereno *Morgan Hill *Mountain View *Palo Alto *San Martin *San Jose *San Juan Bautista *Santa Clara *Saratoga *Sunnyvale Because so much high-tech industry has spread out from the Silicon Valley, Fremont and Newark, even though they are not in Santa Clara County, are often included in discussions about the Silicon Valley or, in the case of Fremont, referred to as the Gateway to the Silicon Valley (a title also claimed occasionally by San Jose, Union City, and several other locations). Similarly, Palo Alto, while in Santa Clara County and considered part of Silicon Valley, is on the San Francisco Peninsula. San Jose is the major city of the South Bay. South San Francisco Bay viewed from Mission Peak Regional Preserve in Fremont, California =San Francisco South Bay= The South Bay is a subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area, California and is roughly synonymous with the Santa Clara Valley, Silicon Valley, and Santa Clara County (in general). The South Bay is one of several subregions in the Bay Area including: San Francisco, the North Bay including parts of the Wine Country, the Peninsula, and the East Bay, among others. Many other cities, towns or census-designated places are also sometimes considered part of the region, such as the San Lorenzo Valley towns between Saratoga and Santa Cruz. Some cities in the East Bay or especially on the Peninsula sometimes are referred to as part of the region. Many of these cities including Menlo Park, Redwood City, Newark, and Fremont are considered part of the Silicon Valley (and therefore the South Bay) because of their relative peripheral location to Santa Clara County, history, or concentration of high-tech companies. The conception of the South Bay as a region is relatively new compared to that of the Peninsula and coastal East Bay. Notable structures Palm trees are common throughout the city of San Jose and in Silicon Valley. There are a number of well-known structures and sites of interest in the South Bay: * Apple Park, Cupertino * Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto * Stanford University, Palo Alto * SAP Center, downtown San Jos√© * Hayes Mansion, Southern San Jos√© * Plaza de C√©sar Ch√°vez, downtown San Jos√© * Cathedral Basilica of Saint Joseph, downtown San Jose * Winchester Mystery House, Western San Jos√© * Santana Row, Western San Jos√© * Lick Observatory, Eastern San Jos√© * Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, Central San Jos√© * Mexican Heritage Plaza, Eastern San Jose * History Park at Kelley Park, Central San Jos√© * Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, Downtown San Jos√© * San Jose International Airport, uptown San Jos√© * San Jose Museum of Art, downtown San Jos√© * San Jose State University, downtown San Jos√© * Santa Clara University, Santa Clara (which includes the original Santa Clara Mission site) * California's Great America, Santa Clara * The Tech Museum of Innovation, downtown San Jos√© * Moffett Federal Airfield, Sunnyvale/Mountain View * Yahoo!, Sunnyvale * LinkedIn, Sunnyvale * Alviso, Northern San Jos√© (sea access/ main port of goods from Asia in 1800 before Oakland took over the following century) * Berryessa Flea Market, Northern San Jos√© (previously Earth's largest) * Gurdwara Sahib of San Jose, Eastern San Jos√© (Sikh Temple built by President Jit Singh Bainiwal) Geology Santa Clara Valley was created by the sudden growth of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Diablo Range during the later Cenozoic era. This was a period of intense mountain building in California when the folding and thrusting of the Earth's crust, combined with active volcanism, gave shape to the present state of California. Hence, Santa Clara Valley is a structural valley, created by mountain building as opposed to an erosional valley, which is a valley that has undergone the wearing away of the Earth's surface by natural agents. The underlying geology of the Santa Cruz Mountains was also formed by the sediment of the ancient seas, where marine shale points to Miocene origin. Today one can still find evidence of this in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where shark's teeth and the remains of maritime life are still found as high as Scotts Valley, a city nestled in the mountains. The highest peak on the Santa Cruz Mountains side of the valley is Loma Prieta at 3,790 feet. The highest peak in the Diablo Range side of the valley is Mount Hamilton, specifically Copernicus Peak at 4,370 feet elevation. It is the highest peak in Santa Clara County. The valley is a graben between the San Andreas and Hayward faults. =Quicksilver mine= During the 19th century, 37,388 metric tons of mercury were extracted from the New Almaden mine south of San Jose and northwest of Santa Cruz. The area, closed for many years, resulted in pollution of the Guadalupe River and South San Francisco Bay. After intermittent mining operations finally ceased in the 20th century, the area was purchased by Santa Clara County to be used as a park and was designated a National Historic Landmark. Climate Looking west over northern San Jose (downtown is at far left) and other parts of Silicon Valley The climate of the Santa Clara Valley in California is a Mediterranean climate with warm, very dry summers and mild, fairly rainy winters. Today, the Valley attracts many people from the East Coast with its warm and sunny climate. The Santa Clara Valley receives on average 330 sunny days per year. The northern areas of the valley (such as Palo Alto or Mountain View) have greater marine influences with temperatures rarely rising above while in the southern areas and near the mountains (such as Los Gatos, Morgan Hill, or Gilroy) the temperature frequently exceeds in the summer months. Winter is the rainy season, but still quite sunny. Winter highs range form to while lows range from to . Summer highs range from to and summer lows range from to .palm trees. The record high for the Santa Clara Valley was recorded in Los Gatos on June 9, 2000, with a temperature of and the record low was recorded in Gilroy on December 23, 1990, with a temperature of . Temperatures drop below on average of 17 days per year, below freezing on average of 4 days per year and below on average of 0 days per year (none). =Temperatures= .

Probability sampling, or random sampling, is a sampling technique in which the probability of getting any particular sample may be calculated. Nonprobability sampling does not meet this criterion. Nonprobability sampling techniques are not intended to be used to infer from the sample to the general population in statistical terms. Instead, for example, grounded theory can be produced through iterative nonprobability sampling until theoretical saturation is reached (Strauss and Corbin, 1990). Thus, one cannot say the same on the basis of a nonprobability sample than on the basis of a probability sample. The grounds for drawing generalizations (e.g., propose new theory, propose policy) from studies based on nonprobability samples are based on the notion of \\"theoretical saturation\\" and \\"analytical generalization\\" (Yin, 2014) instead of on statistical generalization. Researchers working with the notion of purposive sampling assert that while probability methods are suitable for large-scale studies concerned with representativeness, nonprobability approaches are more suitable for in-depth qualitative research in which the focus is often to understand complex social phenomena (e.g., Marshall 1996; Small 2009). One of the advantages of nonprobability sampling is its lower cost compared to probability sampling. Moreover, the in-depth analysis of a small-N purposive sample or a case study enables the \\"discovery\\" and identification of patterns and causal mechanisms that do not draw time and context-free assumptions. Nonprobability sampling is often not appropriate in statistical quantitative research, though, as these assertions raise some questions ‚Äî how can one understand a complex social phenomenon by drawing only the most convenient expressions of that phenomenon into consideration? What assumption about homogeneity in the world must one make to justify such assertions? Alas, the consideration that research can only be based in statistical inference focuses on the problems of bias linked to nonprobability sampling and acknowledges only one situation in which a nonprobability sample can be appropriate ‚Äî if one is interested only in the specific cases studied (for example, if one is interested in the Battle of Gettysburg), one does not need to draw a probability sample from similar cases (Lucas 2014a). Nonprobability sampling is however widely used in qualitative research. Examples of nonprobability sampling include: * Convenience, haphazard or accidental sampling ‚Äì members of the population are chosen based on their relative ease of access. To sample friends, co-workers, or shoppers at a single mall, are all examples of convenience sampling. Such samples are biased because researchers may unconsciously approach some kinds of respondents and avoid others (Lucas 2014a), and respondents who volunteer for a study may differ in unknown but important ways from others (Wiederman 1999). * Consecutive sampling ‚Äì also known as total enumerative sampling, is a sampling technique in which every subject meeting the criteria of inclusion is selected until the required sample size is achieved. * Snowball sampling ‚Äì The first respondent refers an acquaintance. The friend also refers a friend, and so on. Such samples are biased because they give people with more social connections an unknown but higher chance of selection (Berg 2006), but lead to higher response rates. * Judgmental sampling or purposive sampling ‚Äì The researcher chooses the sample based on who they think would be appropriate for the study. This is used primarily when there is a limited number of people that have expertise in the area being researched, or when the interest of the research is on a specific field or a small group. Different types of purposive sampling include: ** Deviant case ‚Äì The researcher obtains cases that substantially differ from the dominant pattern (a special type of purposive sample). The case is selected in order to obtain information on unusual cases that can be specially problematic or specially good. ** Case study ‚Äì The research is limited to one group, often with a similar characteristic or of small size. ** Ad hoc quotas ‚Äì A quota is established (e.g. 65% women) and researchers are free to choose any respondent they wish as long as the quota is met. Nonprobability sampling should not intend to obtain the same types of results or be held to the same quality standards as those of probability sampling (Steinke, 2004). Studies intended to use probability sampling sometimes end up using nonprobability samples because of characteristics of the sampling method. For example, using a sample of people in the paid labor force to analyze the effect of education on earnings is to use a nonprobability sample of persons who could be in the paid labor force. Because the education people obtain could determine their likelihood of being in the paid labor force, the sample in the paid labor force is a nonprobability sample for the question at issue. In such cases results are biased. The statistical model one uses can also render the data a nonprobability sample. For example, Lucas (2014b) notes that several published studies that use multilevel modeling have been based on samples that are probability samples in general, but nonprobability samples for one or more of the levels of analysis in the study. Evidence indicates that in such cases the bias is poorly behaved, such that inferences from such analyses are unjustified. These problems occur in the academic literature, but they may be more common in non-academic research. For example, in public opinion polling by private companies (or other organizations unable to require response), the sample can be self-selected rather than random. This often introduces an important type of error, self-selection bias, in which a potential participant's willingness to volunteer for the sample may be determined by characteristics such as submissiveness or availability.

His father is unknown. He was Jewish.http://www.vjm.biz/new_page_7.htm He spent his childhood in Greece and Russia, where he studied piano at the Moscow Conservatory as a child prodigy. The family emigrated to the United States in 1911. He performed in a classical ensemble in Chicago at the age of 15, later joining one of Edgar Benson's dance orchestras . He leased a ballroom in Detroit and formed a band which grew to success, and was the foundation for a business empire acting as an agency for twenty orchestras and owning many dance halls. In 1936 he filed for bankruptcy, but over the next three decades he built up business again as a musician, conductor and promoter. He married Lee McQuillen, a newspaperwoman, on March 4, 1939. Music career He led many jazz and dance bands, of which the most popular was his Victor Recording Orchestra of 1924‚Äì1929. The band defeated Fletcher Henderson in a battle of the bands contest. The head arranger was Bill Challis and the musicians included Bix Beiderbecke, Steve Brown, Hoagy Carmichael, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Eddie Lang, Chauncey Morehouse, Don Murray, Bill Rank, and Spiegle Willcox. Rex Stewart, a member of Henderson's band, wrote that \\"It was, without any question, the greatest in the world...the original predecessor to any large white dance orchestra that followed, up to Benny Goodman.\\" Brian Rust also called it \\"the greatest band of them all.\\" Goldkette was music director for the Detroit Athletic Club for over 20 years and co-owned the Graystone Ballroom in Detroit with Charles Horvath, who performed with the Goldkette Victor Band in its early years. He owned his own entertainment company, Jean Goldkette's Orchestras and Attractions, working out of the Book-Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. He co-wrote the song \\"It's the Blues (No. 14 Blues)\\" which was recorded in Detroit and released by Victor. He also wrote the words to the 1926 song \\"New Steps\\".1953 Catalog of Copyright Entries. In 1927, Paul Whiteman hired most of Goldkette's better players due to Goldkette's inability to meet payroll for his top-notch musicians. Goldkette helped organize McKinney's Cotton Pickers and Glen Gray's Orange Blossoms, which became popular as the Casa Loma Orchestra. In the 1930s he left jazz to work as a booking agent and classical pianist. In 1939, he organized the American Symphony Orchestra which debuted at Carnegie Hall. Frankie Laine worked as Goldkette's librarian. Death He moved to California in 1961 and the following year died in Santa Barbara, California, of a heart attack at the age of 69. He took a taxi to the hospital by himself and died that same day. He is buried in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

A great-great-grandson of King Edward III of England, he was heir presumptive to King Richard II of England, his first cousin twice removed, when Richard II was deposed in favour of Henry IV. Edmund Mortimer's claim to the throne was the basis of rebellions and plots against Henry IV and his son Henry V, and was later taken up by the House of York in the Wars of the Roses, though Mortimer himself was an important and loyal vassal of Henry V and Henry VI. Edmund was the last Earl of March of the Mortimer family. Early life Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, was born at New Forest, Westmeath, one of his family's Irish estates, on 6 November 1391, the son of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, and Eleanor Holland. He had a younger brother, Roger (1393c. 1413), and two sisters: Anne, who married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, younger son of the Duke of York (executed 1415); and Eleanor, who married Sir Edward de Courtenay (d. 1418), and had no issue.; Edmund Mortimer's mother was the daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and Alice FitzAlan. Thomas Holland's mother, Joan of Kent, a granddaughter of Edward I, was the mother of Richard II by her second marriage; Alice Fitzalan was the daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel, and his second wife, Eleanor, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, grandson of King Henry III.; . Edmund Mortimer was thus a descendant of Henry III and Edward I and a half-great-nephew of Richard II through his mother, and more importantly a descendant of King Edward III through his paternal grandmother Philippa of Clarence, only child of King Edward III's second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence. Because King Richard II had no issue, Edmund's father, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, was heir presumptive during his lifetime, and at his death in Ireland on 20 July 1398 his claim to the throne passed to his eldest son, Edmund. Thus in terms of male primogeniture Edmund was heir to the throne over and above the house of Lancaster, the children of Edward III's third son John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. However, on 30 September 1399, when Edmund Mortimer was not yet eight years of age, his fortunes changed entirely. Richard II was deposed by Henry Bolingbroke, the new Duke of Lancaster, who became King Henry IV and had his own son, the future King Henry V, recognized as heir apparent at his first Parliament. The King put the young Edmund and his brother Roger in the custody of Sir Hugh Waterton at Windsor and Berkhamsted castles, but they were treated honourably, and for part of the time brought up with the King's own children, John and Philippa. Rebellion against Henry IV On 22 June 1402, Edmund's uncle, Sir Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl, was captured by the Welsh rebel leader, Owain Glynd≈µr, at the Battle of Bryn Glas. Henry IV accused Sir Edmund of deserting to Glynd≈µr, refused to ransom him, and confiscated his property. Sir Edmund then married Glynd≈µr's daughter, and on 13 December 1402 proclaimed in writing that his nephew Edmund was the rightful heir to King Richard II. Sir Edmund's sister, Edmund's aunt, was married to Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland. In 1403, the Percys rose in rebellion in collusion with Glynd≈µr and Sir Edmund. Hotspur was defeated and slain at Shrewsbury.; . The alliance of Glynd≈µr, Sir Edmund, and the Percys survived this setback. In February 1405, they agreed to a three-way division of the kingdom.; . This agreement was apparently connected to a plot to free Edmund and his brother Roger from King Henry's custody and carry them into Wales. On 13 February 1405 the boys were abducted from Windsor Castle, but they were quickly recaptured near Cheltenham. Constance of York was held responsible and arrested. She implicated her brother, the Duke of York, who was imprisoned at Pevensey Castle for seventeen weeks. As a result of the failed abduction, on 1 February 1406 Edmund and Roger were put under stricter supervision at Pevensey Castle under Sir John Pelham (d.1429), where they remained until 1409.; ; . On 1 February 1409 Edmund and Roger were given in charge to the King's son, the Prince of Wales, who was only five years older than Edmund. They remained in custody for the remainder of Henry IV's reign. Edmund Mortimer's sisters, Anne and Eleanor, who were in the care of their mother until her death in 1405, were not well treated by Henry IV, and were described as 'destitute' after her death. Reign of Henry V On his accession in 1413 Henry V set Edmund Mortimer at liberty, and on 8 April 1413, the day before the new King's coronation, Edmund Mortimer and his brother Roger were made Knights of the Bath. Nothing further is heard of Roger Mortimer, and it seems likely he died in or shortly after 1413. On 9 June 1413 the King granted Edmund Mortimer livery of his estates.; Henry IV's Queen, Joan of Navarre, had been granted authority over Edmund's marriage on 24 February 1408, but she later ceded this to Henry while Prince of Wales. On 17 January 1415Griffiths dates the dispensation to February. Edmund obtained a papal dispensation to marry ‚Äòa fit woman' related to him in the third degree of kindred or affinity. This allowed him to marry his second cousin once removed, Anne Stafford, the daughter of Anne of Gloucester and Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford. Like Mortimer, she was a descendant of Edward III. The King was displeased, and imposed an enormous fine of 10,000 marks. Despite this momentary discord, Edmund Mortimer was entirely loyal to Henry V. He never made any claim to the throne, despite being senior in descent. He was one of Henry's most trusted counsellors. On 16 April 1415 Mortimer was present at the council which determined on war with France, and on 24 July 1415 he was a witness to the King's will. While preparations for the invasion were underway, some discontented nobles launched the Southampton Plot, to take Mortimer to Wales and proclaim him king. The chief plotter was his sister Anne's husband, the Earl of Cambridge. When Mortimer was made privy to this plan, he revealed the conspiracy to the King at Portchester on 31 July. Afterward, he sat on the commission which condemned Cambridge and the other conspirators to death; they were beheaded on 2 and 5 August. On 7 August, the King formally pardoned Mortimer for any nominal involvement in the plot. Mortimer was deeply in debt when he accompanied Henry V's forces to France. He took part in several campaigns in Normandy, including the Siege of Harfleur, where he contracted dysentery, and was forced to return to England. On 15 August 1416 he was appointed a captain of the expedition sent to relieve Harfleur under John, Duke of Bedford, and Sir Walter Hungerford, and was with the army which conquered Normandy in 1417 and 1418. In July 1420 he was at the siege of Melun. In February 1421 Mortimer accompanied the King back to England with his bride, Catherine of Valois, and bore the sceptre at Catherine's coronation on 21 February. He returned to France with Henry V in June 1421, and was at the Siege of Meaux, where the King fell mortally ill, dying on 31 August 1422. Final years Trim Castle Henry V was succeeded by his nine-month-old son, King Henry VI, and on 9 December 1422Griffiths says Mortimer was appointed to the regency council in November 1422. Mortimer was appointed to the Regency Council of the regency government, 1422‚Äì1437. On 9 May 1423Griffiths dates the appointment to March 1423. he was appointed the King's lieutenant in Ireland for nine years, but at first exercised his authority through a deputy, and remained in England. However, after a violent quarrel with the King's uncle Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and the execution of his kinsman, Sir John Mortimer, Mortimer was \\"sent out of the way to Ireland\\". He arrived there in the autumn of 1424, and on 18 or 19 January 1425 died of plague at Trim Castle. He was buried at Stoke-by-Clare, Suffolk, where he had founded a college of secular canons in 1414. Clare Priory, burial place of Edmund Mortimer Mortimer had no issue, and at his death the Mortimer line of the Earls of March became extinct. The heir to his estates and titles was the son of his sister Anne and the Earl of Cambridge, Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (1411‚Äì1460). Richard also inherited Mortimer's claim to the throne, which he eventually raised, causing the Wars of the Roses. His widow, Anne, married, before 6 March 1427, John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter. She died 20 or 24 September 1432, and was buried in the church of St Katharine's by the Tower. The Wigmore chronicle describes Edmund Mortimer as \\"severe in his morals, composed in his acts, circumspect in his talk, and wise and cautious during the days of his adversity\\". Shakespeare and the Mortimers Events in the life of Sir Edmund Mortimer, uncle of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, were dramatized by Shakespeare in Henry IV, Part 1. In the play Shakespeare accurately identifies Sir Edmund Mortimer as Hotspur's brother-in-law, but simultaneously conflates him with his nephew by referring to him as 'Earl of March'. The Southampton Plot is dramatized in Shakespeare's play Henry V (Act II Scene II). But its intent is misstated, and Mortimer's role in exposing it and condemning the plotters is completely omitted. Edmund Mortimer also appears in Henry VI, Part 1 (Act II, Scene V). He is erroneously depicted as elderly (he was 33), and a dying prisoner in the Tower of London, kept there since the rise of Henry IV. Also erroneously, he explains to his nephew Richard their claim to the throne, praises Richard's father's effort to make Mortimer king, and urges Richard to take up the claim.

Content The film documents how Ry Cooder, long-time friend of Wenders, brought together the ensemble of legendary Cuban musicians to record an album (also called Buena Vista Social Club) and to perform two times with a full line-up: in April 1998 in Amsterdam (two nights) and the 1st of July 1998 in the United States (at the Carnegie Hall, New York City). Although they are geographically close, travel between Cuba and the United States is restricted due to the political tension between the two countries, so many of the artists were travelling there for the first time.

Cuba Austin took over for McKinney on drums. Between 1927 and 1931, they were one of the most popular African-American bands. Many of their records for Victor were bestsellers. In 1927, Fletcher Henderson's arranger and saxophone player Don Redman was invited to become the Cotton Pickers' musical director and he assembled a band. John Nesbitt helped Redman with arrangements and rehearsals. The band in 1928 included Cuba Austin (drums and vocals), Langston Curl (trumpet), Ralph Escudero (tuba), Claude Jones, Redman (clarinet, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, vocals), Todd Rhodes (piano, celeste), Prince Robinson (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Milton Senior (trombone), George Thomas (clarinet, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, vocals) and Dave Wilborn (banjo, vocals). Other band members included George Bias (vocals), Benny Carter (clarinet, alto saxophone), Doc Cheatham (trumpet), Bill Coti (vocals), Ed Cuffee (trombone), Lois Deppe (vocals), Jimmy Dudley (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Robert Inge (clarinet, (alto saxophone), Quentin Jackson (trombone), Moxey-Hilton Jefferson (clarinet, alto saxophone), James P. Johnson (piano), Buddy Lee (trumpet), Donald King (vocals), Frank Marvin (vocals), Theodore McCord (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Jim Napier (vocals), Rex Stewart (cornet), and Billy Taylor (tuba). Towards the end of 1929, a number of soloists who were not regular members of the band sat in for a series of recordings. These included Leonard Davis (trumpet), Sidney de Paris (trumpet), Coleman Hawkins (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Fats Waller (piano, celeste), Joe \\"Fox\\" Smith (trumpet, cornet) , and Kaiser Marshall (drums). In 1931 Redman left to form a band and was replaced by Benny Carter. The Cotton Pickers disbanded in 1934, unable to make money during the Depression. Manager of the band was Jean Goldkette who arranged for the group to record \\"Birmingham Bertha\\" for him in July 1929. A New McKinney's Cotton Pickers was organized in the early 1970s by David Hutson using the arrangements by Don Redman. The band recorded several albums and featured banjoist Dave Wilborn, who was the only surviving original member.

The rectangular function, the frequency response of the sinc filter. In signal processing, a sinc filter is an idealized filter that removes all frequency components above a given cutoff frequency, without affecting lower frequencies, and has linear phase response. The filter's impulse response is a sinc function in the time domain, and its frequency response is a rectangular function. It is an \\"ideal\\" low-pass filter in the frequency sense, perfectly passing low frequencies, perfectly cutting high frequencies; and thus may be considered to be a brick-wall filter. Real-time filters can only approximate this ideal, since an ideal sinc filter (a.k.a. rectangular filter) is non- causal and has an infinite delay, but it is commonly found in conceptual demonstrations or proofs, such as the sampling theorem and the Whittaker‚ÄìShannon interpolation formula. In mathematical terms, the desired frequency response is the rectangular function: :H(f) = \\\\mathrm{rect} \\\\left( \\\\frac{f}{2B} \\\\right) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{rl} 0, & \\\\text{if } f > B, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2}, & \\\\text{if } f = B, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1, & \\\\text{if } f < B, \\\\end{array}\\\\right. where B\\\\, is an arbitrary cutoff frequency (a.k.a. bandwidth). The impulse response of such a filter is given by the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency response: : \\\\begin{align} h(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\\\\\{ H (f)\\\\\\\\} &= \\\\int_{-B}^B \\\\exp(2\\\\pi i f t) \\\\, df \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2B \\\\, \\\\mathrm{sinc}(2 B t) \\\\end{align} where sinc is the normalized sinc function. As the sinc filter has infinite impulse response in both positive and negative time directions, it must be approximated for real-world (non- abstract) applications; a windowed sinc filter is often used instead. Windowing and truncating a sinc filter kernel in order to use it on any practical real world data set reduces its ideal properties. Brick-wall filters An idealized electronic filter, one that has full transmission in the pass band, and complete attenuation in the stop band, with abrupt transitions, is known colloquially as a \\"brick-wall filter\\", in reference to the shape of the transfer function. The sinc filter is a brick-wall low-pass filter, from which brick-wall band-pass filters and high-pass filters are easily constructed. The lowpass filter with brick-wall cutoff at frequency BL has impulse response and transfer function given by: : h_{LPF}(t) = 2B_L \\\\, \\\\mathrm{sinc}\\\\left(2B_L t\\\\right) : H_{LPF}(f) = \\\\mathrm{rect}\\\\left( \\\\frac{f}{2B_L} \\\\right). The band-pass filter with lower band edge BL and upper band edge BH is just the difference of two such sinc filters (since the filters are zero phase, their magnitude responses subtract directly): : h_{BPF}(t) = 2B_H \\\\, \\\\mathrm{sinc}\\\\left(2B_H t\\\\right) - 2B_L \\\\, \\\\mathrm{sinc}\\\\left(2B_L t\\\\right) : H_{BPF}(f) = \\\\mathrm{rect}\\\\left( \\\\frac{f}{2B_H} \\\\right) - \\\\mathrm{rect}\\\\left( \\\\frac{f}{2B_L} \\\\right). The high- pass filter with lower band edge BH is just a transparent filter minus a sinc filter, which makes it clear that the Dirac delta function is the limit of a narrow-in-time sinc filter: : h_{HPF}(t) = \\\\delta(t) - 2B_H \\\\, \\\\mathrm{sinc}\\\\left(2B_H t\\\\right) : H_{HPF}(f) = 1 - \\\\mathrm{rect}\\\\left( \\\\frac{f}{2B_H} \\\\right). Brick-wall filters that run in realtime are not physically realizable as they have infinite latency (i.e., its compact support in the frequency domain forces its time response not to have compact support meaning that it is ever-lasting) and infinite order (i.e., the response cannot be expressed as a linear differential equation with a finite sum), but approximate implementations are sometimes used and they are frequently called brick-wall filters. Frequency-domain sinc The name \\"sinc filter\\" is applied also to the filter shape that is rectangular in time and a sinc function in frequency, as opposed to the ideal low-pass sinc filter, which is sinc in time and rectangular in frequency. In case of confusion, one may refer to these as sinc-in-frequency and sinc-in-time, according to which domain the filter is sinc in. Sinc-in-frequency CIC filters, among many other applications, are almost universally used for decimating delta-sigma ADCs, as they are easy to implement and nearly optimal for this use. The simplest implementation of a Sinc-in-frequency filter is a group-averaging filter, also known as accumulate-and-dump filter. This filter also performs a data rate reduction. Filter transmission function of a 4sample group averaging filter It collects N data samples, accumulates them and provides the accumulator value as output. Thus, the decimation factor of this filter is N. It can be modelled as a FIR filter with all N coefficients equal, followed by a N-time downsampling block. The simplicity of the filter, requiring just an accumulator as central data processing block, is foiled with strong aliasing effects: an N sample filter aliases all attenuated and unattenuated signal components lying above \\\\frac{f_S}{2N} to the baseband ranging from 0 to \\\\frac{f_S}{2N} ( fS is the input sample rate). Filter transmission function of a 32sample group averaging filter A group averaging filter processing N samples has N/2 transmission zeroes. The picture \\"transmission function of a 16sample group averaging filter\\" shows how the transmission function looks like above the Nyquist frequency. transmission function of a 16sample group averaging filter working on a 1kHz input data rate, extended to 4x the Nyquist frequency Stability The sinc filter is not bounded-input‚Äìbounded-output (BIBO) stable. That is, a bounded input can produce an unbounded output, because the integral of the absolute value of the sinc function is infinite. A bounded input that produces an unbounded output is sgn(sinc(t)). Another is sin(2Bt)u(t), a sine wave starting at time 0, at the cutoff frequency.

He worked as a drummer in a circus band, then after serving in the United States Army in World War I settled in Springfield, Ohio where he took over leadership of the Synco Jazz Band. After hiring drummer Cuba Austin, McKinney worked as leader and business manager. After touring the U.S. Midwest, they got a residency at the Arcadia Ballroom in Detroit, Michigan in 1926. In Detroit they were heard by bandleader and music promoter Jean Goldkette, who arranged a more lucrative home base for the band in Detroit's Graystone Ballroom. The band was renamed McKinney's Cotton Pickers. After the band broke up in 1934 during the Great Depression, McKinney for a time led and played with a dance band in Boston, From 1937 on McKinney managed a Detroit Cafe with a dance floor and live bands who McKinney booked; he also booked bands for other locations on the side.

It was originally composed of five corps, composed of two divisions each, plus a cavalry division: II Corps: Commanded by Sir Claud Jacob :* Light Division (formed from 2nd Division): Commanded by Major-General George Jeffreys :* Southern Division (formed from 29th Division): Commanded by Major- General William Heneker IV Corps: Commanded by Sir Alexander Godley :* Lowland Division (formed from 9th Division) :* Highland Division (formed from 62nd Division) VI Corps: Commanded by Sir Aylmer Haldane :* Northern Division (formed from 3rd Division) :* London Division (formed from 41st Division) IX Corps: Commanded by Sir Walter Braithwaite and later by Ivor Maxse :* Western Division (formed from 1st Division) :* Midland Division (formed from 6th Division) X Corps: Commanded by Sir Thomas Morland :* Lancashire Division (formed from 32nd Division) :* Eastern Division (formed from 34th Division) Cavalry Division (formed from 1st Cavalry Division) Most of these units were progressively dissolved, so that by February 1920 there were only regular battalions: :* 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment :* 4th Battalion Worcestershire Regiment :* 2nd Battalion Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) :* 1st Battalion Middlesex Regiment :* 3rd Battalion Middlesex Regiment :* 1st Battalion Durham Light Infantry In August 1920 Winston Churchill told the British Parliament that the BAOR comprised approximately 13,360 troops, consisting of staff, cavalry, Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, infantry, machine gun corps, tanks, and the usual ancillary services. The troops were located principally in the vicinity of Cologne at an approximate cost per month of ¬£300,000.Hansard, Debate 10 August 1920 vol 133 cc204-5 The Cologne Post was a newspaper published for members of the BAOR during this period.

Its original function was to control the corps districts which were running the military government of the British zone of occupied Germany. After the assumption of government by civilians, it became the command formation for the troops in Germany only, rather than being responsible for administration as well. As the potential threat of Soviet invasion across the North German Plain into West Germany increased, BAOR became more responsible for the defence of West Germany than its occupation. It became the primary formation controlling the British contribution to NATO after the formation of the alliance in 1949. Its primary combat formation was British I Corps. From 1952 the commander-in-chief of the BAOR was also the commander of NATO's Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) in the event of a general war with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. The BAOR was formerly armed with tactical nuclear weapons. In 1967, the force was reduced in strength to 53,000 soldiers, compared with 80,000 ten years earlier. =Post 1994= The 1993 Options for Change defence cuts resulted in BAOR being reduced in size, and in 1994 it became British Forces Germany (BFG). This force, roughly 25,000 strong, was divided between Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps, 1st Armoured Division, other combat support and combat service support forces, and administrative elements headed by United Kingdom Support Command (Germany). Garrisons which closed at this time included Soest (home of the 6th Armoured Brigade), Soltau (home of the 7th Armoured Brigade) and Minden (home of the 11th Armoured Brigade). Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the permanent deployment of British Army units in Germany began to be phased out, with the last military base handed back to the German Bundeswehr in February 2020.

The road is featured in several famous novels, notably A Hero of Our Time and Twelve Chairs. The Georgian Military Road or Georgian Military Highway (, [sakartvelos samkhedro gza], , [Arvykomy f√¶ndag]) is the historic name for a major route through the Caucasus from Georgia to Russia. Alternative routes across the mountains include the Ossetian Military Road and the Transkam. Route The highest part of Georgian Military Road at the Jvari (Krestovy) Pass. The photo is taken in the month of May The Georgian Military Road (ca. 212 kilometres long) runs between Tbilisi (Georgia) and Vladikavkaz (Russia) and follows the traditional route used by invaders and traders throughout the ages. From Vladikavkaz, the road stretches southwards up the valley of the Terek before passing through the Darial Gorge (which marks the border between Russia and Georgia). It then passes Mount Kazbek and Gergeti Trinity Church before heading south-west through the Georgian region of Khevi to the Jvari Pass, where it reaches its maximum altitude of 2,379 meters (7,815 feet) (). Not long after the pass the road passes the Russia‚ÄìGeorgia Friendship Monument, a large concrete monument built in 1983 to commemorate relations between the two countries and the bicentennial of the Treaty of Georgievsk. The road then turns south-eastwards, following the Tetri Aragvi River through Mtiuleti down to the town of Pasanauri, before heading due south. It then passes below the walls of the medieval fortress of Ananuri before cutting across the wide floodplain of the Tetri Aragvi down to a point just north of Georgia's historic capital, Mtskheta, where it merges into Georgia's main East-West highway (the E60). In this guise, the Georgian Military Road technically continues along the right bank of the Kura (Mtkvari) River before reaching nearby Tbilisi.The Times Atlas of the World, 13th ed. (2011) The 1914 edition of Baedeker's Russia describes the Georgian Military Road as 'one of the most beautiful mountain roads in the world', and mentions the fact that, as early as its date of publication, 'motor omnibuses of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise des transports automobiles du Caucase ply regularly from April 15 to Oct. 15th, [accomplishing] the journey in 10 hrs.'Online copy of Baedeker's Russia (1914) History People have used this route since antiquity - both Strabo (in his Geographica) and Pliny the Elder mention it. Russian troops first travelled it in 1769. Pavel Potemkin sent 800 men to improve the road so that by October 1783 he was able to drive to Tiflis in a carriage drawn by eight horses. The Georgian Military Road in its present form was begun by the Russian military in 1799, after the Georgians had abjured centuries of Persian suzerainty and became a Russian protectorate under the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Russian control of the Georgian Military Highway in the center of the Caucasus divided the Caucasian War (1817-1864) into the Russo-Circassian War (1763-1864) in the west and the Murid War in the east. After the Russian Empire officially annexed the Kingdom of Georgia in 1801, Tsar Alexander I ordered General Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov, the commander-in-chief of Russian forces in the Caucasus, to improve the road surface to facilitate troop movement and communications. When Yermolov announced the completion of work in 1817, the highway was heralded as the \\"Russian Simplon\\". However, work continued until 1863. By this stage, it had cost ¬£4,000,000 (a staggering sum in the 1860s) but according to BryceLord James Bryce, TransCaucasia and Ararat (London 1877), page 116 in 1876 the work was of a high quality, with two or three lanes and \\"iron bridges over the torrents\\", something he considered astonishing given that within Russia proper at this time decent roads were virtually non-existent. The Georgian Military Road played an important role in the economic development of Transcaucasia and in the Russo-Circassian War. The Georgian Military Road today The importance of the Georgian Military Road as a through route has diminished in recent years, primarily due to delays at the border crossing between Russia and Georgia, natural disasters such as landslides,\\"One Dead, Several Missing in Dariali Landslide\\", Civil Georgia, 18 May 2014 and the outright closure of the border crossing by Russia in 2006. However, since 2013, when Russia finally agreed to re-open its side of the border as a result of Armenian demands, the road has once again become an important transport artery, mainly for trailer lorries linking Armenia and Russia.\\"Russia and Georgia Expand Their Only Border Crossing Point\\", Jamestown Foundation, Eurasia Daily Monitor, 10(163), 16 September 2013 Various restrictions, however, remained (and still remain) in place, particularly for Georgian citizens, but by 2013 a representative of the Russian side of the border could tell the Interfax news agency that around 3 million people had passed through the Kazbegi-Verkhni Lars customs checkpoint.\\"Russia-Georgia border crossing will be open 24 hours\\", DFWatch, 14 January 2014 Currently (2015), the Georgian end of the Road is frequently clogged with lorries, apparently due to the length of time needed for vehicles transiting Georgia to be admitted into Russia.\\"Kilometer-long traffic jams at Upper Lars checkpoint\\", Vestnik Kavkaza, 28 June 2015\\"Armenia expeditor: Armenia should send emissary to Russia over traffic jam in Lars\\", News.am, 2 September 2015 See also * List of highest paved roads in Europe * List of mountain passes * European route E117 * S3 highway (Georgia) References *Rosen, Roger.

It has an area of . The island forms part of the local government district of Swale. Sheppey is derived from Old English Sceapig, meaning \\"Sheep Island\\". Today's island was historically known as the \\"Isles of Sheppey\\" which were Sheppey itself, the Isle of Harty to the south east and the Isle of Elmley to the south west. Over time the channels between the islands have silted up to make one continuous island. Sheppey, like much of north Kent, is largely formed from London Clay and is a plentiful source of fossils. The Mount near Minster rises to above sea level and is the highest point on the island. The rest of Sheppey is low-lying and the southern part of the island is marshy land criss-crossed by inlets and drains, largely used for grazing. The Swale Welcome sign Sheppey is separated from the mainland by a channel called the Swale. In concert with the Wantsum Channel that once separated the Isle of Thanet from mainland Britain to the east (before it silted over in the late Middle Ages), and Yantlet Creek at the Isle of Grain to the west, it was occasionally used in ancient times by ships navigating to and from ports such as Chatham and London to reduce exposure to bad weather in the Thames Estuary or North Sea. =Bridges= The Kingsferry Bridge The Sheppey Crossing with the towers of the Kingsferry Bridge seen from the island The Kingsferry Bridge was first built in 1860, thus eliminating the need for ferries. Over time, there have been four bridges built over the Swale at this point. All bridges had to allow sufficient clearance for shipping heading to the commercial docks at Ridham: * 19 July 1860: The London, Chatham and Dover Railway built the first bridge to an Admiralty design. It had a central span raised between two towers. Trains and road traffic were able to use it, as with the next two bridges. * 6 November 1906: The South Eastern and Chatham Railway replaced the first bridge with one having a \\"rolling lift\\" design. It was originally worked by hand, but later by electricity. * October 1959: Kingsferry Bridge, a lifting bridge was installed, able to lift both the road and the railway line to allow ships to pass beneath.Information on the bridge from Railways of the Southern Region Geoffrey Body (PSL Field Guide 1884) * May 2006: The Sheppey Crossing was completed and opened on 3 July. This four-lane road bridge rises to a height of 95 feet (29m) at mean high water springs above the Swale, and carries the A249 trunk road. Pedestrian, animal and bicycle traffic, as well as the railway, are still obliged to use the lifting bridge, which still provides the most direct link between the island and the Iwade/Lower Halstow area. On 5 September 2013, fog caused a 130 vehicle pile-up on the Sheppey Crossing bridge and its northern approach. With eight people seriously hurt, another 30 hospitalised and a further 120 classified as \\"walking wounded\\", the incident was the county's worst road accident in twenty years. =Ferries= Four ferries previously connected the island to mainland Kent: the King's Ferry to Iwade, the Harty Ferry to Faversham, one from Elmley, and a passenger ferry connecting to the Port Victoria railway terminus on the Grain Peninsula. The most recently active of these, the Harty Ferry, ceased operation at the start of the First World War, although there was a short lived attempt to start a small hovercraft service between the Harty Ferry Inn and Oare Creek near Faversham in 1970. Sheppey history The complex of causewayed enclosures at Kingsborough Manor attests to the importance of the island's high ground during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Later prehistoric, Roman and medieval occupation has been found by archaeologists in advance of development at Neat's Court and St Clements CofE Primary School in Leysdown. = Vikings = In the year 835, Viking invaders attacked Sheppey. It is the first known account of a major Viking raid in Southern England.The Anglo-Saxon ChronicleBlair 2003. p. 68. Sheppey would go onto suffer from subsequent raids, its vulnerable coastal monasteries providing a convenient target for the Danes. In 855, Sheppey as part of the kingdom of Wessex, became the winter camp of an occupying Viking force, presumably the raiders from prior attacks. Raiding continued in the springtime, with Sheppey's minsters being used by the invaders as feasting halls or general headquarters. = Shurland Hall = Shurland Hall in 2011 Shurland Hall, near Eastchurch, is named after its first owners, the De Shurland family. In 1188 Adam de Shurland possessed a mill with more than of mixed land, mostly marsh with a small meadow: he also let a number of cottages thereabouts. A curious tale surrounds a 14th-century member of the family, Sir Robert de Shurland. According to legend, Sir Robert killed a monk and resolved to ask the king for a pardon. In 1327 he rode to where the king's ship was anchored, off the Isle of Sheppey, and gained forgiveness. Returning, he met a witch who said that de Shurland's horse, Grey Dolphin, which had borne him so bravely to the ship, would be the death of him. Sir Robert immediately killed the horse and cut off its head. A year later Sir Robert was walking along the shore when a shard of the horse's bone pierced his foot. Blood poisoning set in and Sir Robert died. Sir Robert de Shurland also possessed the Manor of Ufton in the parish of Tunstall, Kent, in the reign of Edward I. After he attended the prince in Scotland, to the siege of Caerlaverock, where he was knighted, and in 1300, he then obtained a charter of free warren for his manor of Ufton. Shurland died in 1327 leaving as his heir a daughter Margery who married William the son of Alexander Cheyne of Patrixborne, Kent. To William passed the manor of Shurland. It remained in possession of the Cheyne family until the sixteenth century when it was sold by Sir Henry Cheyne. During the First World War troops were billeted at the Great Hall, and it suffered considerable damage as a result. Shurland Hall is a Grade II listed building. In 2006 a grant of ¬£300,000 was made by English Heritage to restore the hall's fa√ßade. The Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust carried out the restoration work which was completed in 2011. The house was put on the open market for ¬£1.5 million, and was sold. = Dutch occupation of 1667 = Sheppey enjoys the dubious distinction of being one of few parts of what is now the United Kingdom to be (temporarily) lost to a foreign power since William the Conqueror's invasion in 1066. This was in June 1667, when a Dutch fleet sailing up the Thames Estuary for the Medway captured the fort at Sheerness. The fort at the time was incomplete and the garrison underfed and unpaid, so resistance to the heavily armed Dutch Navy (which, according to Samuel Pepys' diary, was also to a large extent manned by deserters from the English Royal Navy) was hardly enthusiastic. Pepys, then secretary of the Navy Board, described Sheerness as lost \\"after two or three hours' dispute\\". The Dutch quickly overran and occupied the whole island for several days before withdrawing. Prior to leaving, the Dutch took supplies, ammunition and guns, then burned everything that was combustible. = Capture of James II = Three miles (5 km) across the Swale lies Whitstable. The Swale channel was the point of departure selected by James II, when departing in some haste \\"from the Protestant deliverance of the nation\\" by William of Orange in December 1688. A hoy having been chartered, the fugitive king landed at Elmley, only to be mobbed by local fishermen. They thought such a noble on such a humble vessel was the locally hated Jesuit Edward Petre and so took his money, watch and coronation ring. At length he was recognised by one of the assailants and the group took him in custody to Faversham, where he was detained. = Bluetown Heritage Centre = Bluetown hosts the history and Heritage Centre for the Isle of Sheppey. The Heritage Centre contains memorabilia and artefacts pertinent to the Sheppey's history, including displays on aviation, maritime, war time activities, and island history and offers guided walks of Sheppey Isle and Bluetown. The present Heritage Centre is on the site of two earlier establishments. Originally called the \\"New Inn\\", in 1868 the site became \\"The Royal Oxford Music Hall\\". The following year the building, which is situated a few doors down from the Bluetown court house, became the Criterion Public House, with a music hall called the \\"palace of varieties\\" situated immediately to its rear. In 1879 the building was replaced with a brick structure. On 5 June 1917 the Criterion was badly damaged by a German air raid. Shrapnel marks from the attack can still be seen in the dockyard wall opposite the building. After the air raid, the building was re- built in its present form retaining some of its original features. After a variety of other uses, the site became the Heritage Centre in January 2009. A special exhibition in 2014 commemorated the centenary of World War I.  Maritime history  View towards Minster from Elmley Marshes Sheerness is a commercial port and main town of the Isle of Sheppey and owes much to its origins, as a Royal Naval dockyard town. Samuel Pepys established the Royal Navy Dockyard in the 17th century. Henry VIII, requiring the River Medway as an anchorage for his navy, ordered that the mouth of the river should be protected by a small fort. Garrison Fort was built in 1545. Sheerness was the focus of an attack by the Dutch Navy in June 1667, when 72 hostile ships compelled the little \\"sandspit fort\\" there to surrender and landed a force which for a short while occupied the town. Samuel Pepys at Gravesend remarked in his diary \\"we do plainly at this time hear the guns play\\" and in fear departed to Brampton in Huntingdonshire. The dockyard served the Royal Navy until 1960 and has since developed into one of the largest and fastest expanding ports in the UK. The Port of Sheerness contains at least one Grade II listed building, the Old Boat House. Built in 1866, it is the first multi- storey iron framed industrial building recorded in the UK. Decorated with ornate ironwork, it features operating rails extending the length of the building, for the movement of stores, much like a modern crane. The dockyard and port at Sheerness today are a significant feature of the Isle of Sheppey's economy, which includes the extensive export/import of motor vehicles, and a large steel works, with extensive railway fixtures. The island is, however, suffering from an economic recession and these industries are not as extensive as they once were. The area immediately outside the dockyard was occupied by dockyard workers, who built wooden houses and decorated them with Admiralty blue paint illegally acquired from the dockyard. This area was, and still is, known as Blue Town, though it is now mostly occupied by the Sheerness Steel complex. Beyond Blue Town, an outlying residential area overlooking the sea was chiefly designed for various government officials. This area became known as Mile Town because it is one mile (1.6 km) from Sheerness. About 200 shipwrecks are recorded around the coast of Sheppey, the most famous being the SS Richard Montgomery, a liberty ship loaded with bombs and explosives that grounded on sandbanks during the Second World War. plans were discussed with a view to removing the threat from the Montgomery. These include encasing the ship in concrete or removing the bombs; no firm decision has been made. New research commissioned by the Government in 2005‚Äì06 has suggested that the threat has passed and that constant surveillance should ensure the safety of the immediate community. A large ferry terminal was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway at Queenborough Pier in 1876 and operated a nightly service to Flushing (Vlissingen) in the Netherlands, as well as a German mail service. These services ceased during the First World War; the terminal was used for military traffic. The small port was closed and dismantled in the 1930s. A passenger, car and lorry service was operated by Olau Line from 1974 to 1994.  Natural history  In 1629 the first recorded botanical visit was paid to the island by the apothecary Thomas Johnson and colleagues. They were thought to be foreigners so were arrested and imprisoned in Queenborough Castle before being released by the Mayor. Edward Jacob (1710‚Äì1788) purchased the little Manor of Nutts, Isle of Sheppey, in 1752. There, he pursued his hobby as a naturalist. He discovered much of interest to the antiquarian, naturalist, geologist and zoologist, although there was little prior knowledge. In 1777, Jacob published a book about his various fossil finds, including what he called \\"the remains of an elephant\\". The island is noted as the northernmost place to have an established scorpion population. Euscorpius flavicaudis has been resident since the 1860s, believed to have been imported on a ship. They have been found to be highly adaptable and hence have survived the relative cold by conserving energy and only acting for nutrition and reproduction.\\"Science: scorpions in a cold climate\\" (16 May 1992) New Scientist Issue. 1821, retrieved 17 September 2010 The last known colony in England of the British endemic subspecies of the Essex Emerald moth, at Windmill creek, died out as late as 1991. In 2008 palaeontologists published details of the fossil skull, found on the island, of a large flying bird from the Eocene epoch called Dasornis in the deposits of the London Clay.  Local government  From 1894 to 1968, Sheppey comprised the Municipal Borough of Queenborough, Sheerness Urban District and Sheppey Rural District (consisting of the civil parishes of Eastchurch, Elmley, Harty, Leysdown-on-Sea, Minster in Sheppey and Warden). 1968 saw all these merged to form a single Municipal Borough of Queenborough-in-Sheppey, covering the entire island. In 1974 the area was merged with districts on the mainland to form the Swale district. In parliamentary terms, Sheppey has been in the constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey since 1997, a Conservative-Labour marginal seat; prior to this it was in the Faversham constituency, also a marginal but held by the Conservatives for the last 27 years of its existence.  Early aviation  The Memorial to the Home of Aviation in Eastchurch The island has a long history of aviation development in England. It was home to Lord Brabazon's Royal Aero Club which formed in Leysdown in the early 1900s to popularise ballooning. The club took to the aeroplane with relish, and in July 1909 the Short Brothers established Shellbeach Aerodrome on nearby marshland to accommodate six Wright Flyers, moving a few kilometres the next year to Eastchurch where a new more appropriate aerodrome had been built for the club. The Eastchurch airfield played a significant role in the history of British aviation from 1909 when Frank McClean acquired Stonepits Farm, on the marshes across from Leysdown, converting the land into an airfield for members of the Aero Club of Great Britain. The Short brothers, Horace, Eustace and Oswald, built aircraft at Battersea to be tested at the site; later Moore-Brabazon, Professor Huntington, Charles S. Rolls and Cecil Grace all visited and used the flying club's services. Wilbur Wright and his brother Orville came to the Isle of Sheppey to visit the new flying grounds of the Aero Club. In 1909, Moore- Brabazon made the first live cargo flight by fixed-wing aircraft, by tying a waste-paper basket to a wing strut of his Shorts-built Wright aircraft. Then, using it as a \\"cargo hold\\", he airlifted one small pig. The Eastchurch airfield was also the site, in July 1911, of the competition for the Gordon Bennett Cup for powered air racing, attended by flyers from all over the world, and won that year by the American pilot C. T. Weymann. A stained glass window in the south side of All Saints' Church, Eastchurch (built in 1432), was dedicated to Rolls and Grace, who were killed in July and December 1910 respectively. In July 2009, Eastchurch celebrated 100 years of aviation history associated with the island. SkySheppey brought together a number of associations and joined with many visitors to recognise the importance of British aviation history that started at Eastchurch. From March 2015 a new museum, The Aviation Museum Eastchurch, was set up at The Old Mill Green off Brabazon Way, HMP Standford Hill, to commemorate the pioneer aviators and the site as a long established RAF Station serving from WW1 through to the end of WW2. Sheppey today The beach between Leysdown and Shell Ness. The largest town on the island is Sheerness. Other villages include Minster, which has a pebble beach, and Leysdown-on-Sea, which has a coarse sandy one. The whole north coast is dotted with caravan parks and holiday homes; there is also a naturist beach beyond Leysdown, towards Shellness. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds managed a portion of Elmley National Nature Reserve known as Elmley Marshes up until 2013, at which point it reverted to management by Elmley Conservation Trust, owners of the site. An aerial view of Eastchurch village, a caravan site, the three prisons and the North Sea There are three prisons on the island, all located to the south of the village of Eastchurch: HMP Elmley, HMP Standford Hill and HMP Swaleside. The total inmate population is in the region of 2,800. In the 2001 census, the island had a resident population of 37,852, many of whom commute to the mainland via the Sheerness- Sittingbourne rail link and the new Sheppey Crossing Bridge. Education Secondary education on the island is provided by Oasis Academy Isle of Sheppey. The school moved into new buildings in February 2013 and is split between two sites: East and West. The academy is split horizontally into five mini-schools. There are several primary schools on the island. Sport and leisure The island has a non-league football club, Sheppey United F.C., based at Holm Park and who play in the Southern Counties East Football League, Premier Division. The island's largest cricket club is Minster Cricket Club, who compete in the Kent Cricket League as well as Sheppey Cricket Club which plays in the Kent Regional Cricket League. The island also has a rugby union club, Sheppey RFC. Minster Cricket Club Pavilion The Isle of Sheppey Sailing club (previously Sheppey Yacht Club) organises the Round the Isle of Sheppey Race, established in 1959, and other races for mono hulls and catamarans. Local radio Three radio stations broadcast from Sheppey. BRFM 95.6 FM broadcasts 24 hours a day from studios on the Minster Cliffs, Also Sheppey FM 92.2, a community radio station based in the Heritage Pavilion, Sheerness. And Hospital Radio Swale which broadcasts from the Sheppey Community Hospital in Minster. Airport On 21 September 2008, Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said that an airport off the coast of Sheppey would be a viable alternative to creating a new third runway at Heathrow.

It had a short-lived precursor during the Waterloo Campaign. Napoleonic precursor Assembling an army in Belgium to fight Napoleon's resurgent forces in the spring of 1815, the Duke of Wellington formed it into army corps, deliberately mixing units from the Anglo-Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian and German contingents so that the weaker elements would be stiffened by more experienced or reliable troops. As he put it: 'It was necessary to organize these troops in brigades, divisions, and corps d‚Äôarmee with those better disciplined and more accustomed to war'.Hofschroer, Ligny and Quatre Bras, p.109. He placed I Corps under the command of the Prince of Orange and it was this corps that was first contacted by the advancing French at Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815. However, Wellington did not employ the corps as tactical entities, and continued his accustomed practice of issuing orders directly to divisional and lower commanders. When he drew up his army on the ridge at Waterloo, elements of the various corps were mixed up, and although he gave the Prince of Orange nominal command of the centre, that officer had different forces under him. Subsequent to the battle, the corps structure was re-established for the advance into France, I Corps being commanded by Maj-Gen Sir John Byng, the Prince of Orange having been wounded at Waterloo.Hofschroer, The German Victory, p.201. =Composition of I Corps in the Waterloo Campaign= General Officer Commanding (GOC): General The Prince of Orange * 1st (British) Division (British Guards) * 3rd (British) Division (Anglo-Hanoverian) * 2nd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch- Belgian) * 3rd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch-Belgian) Prior to the First World War After Waterloo the army corps structure largely disappeared from the British Army, except for ad hoc formations assembled during annual manoeuvres (e.g. Army Manoeuvres of 1913). In 1876 a Mobilisation Scheme for eight army corps was published, with 'First Corps' based on Colchester. In 1880 First Corps' organization was: * 1st Division (Colchester) ** 1st Brigade (Colchester) *** 1st Bn. 2nd Foot (Colchester), 1st Bn. 10th Foot (Colchester) ** 2nd Brigade (Colchester) *** 1st Bn. 9th Foot (Kinsale), 28th Foot (Fermoy) ** Divisional Troops *** 2nd Bn. 12th Foot (Portsmouth), Buckinghamshire Yeomanry (Buckingham), 1st Company Royal Engineers (Shorncliffe) ** Artillery *** F/1st Brigade Royal Artillery (Ipswich), D/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich) * 2nd Division (Chelmsford) ** 1st Brigade (Chelmsford) *** 1st Bn. 15th Foot (Tipperary), 47th Foot (The Curragh) ** 2nd Brigade (Warley) *** 1st Bn. 3rd Foot (Shorncliffe), 49th Foot (Dover), 55th Foot (Shorncliffe) ** Divisional Troops *** 1st Bn. 23rd Foot (Woolwich), Hertfordshire Yeomanry (St Albans), 20th Company Royal Engineers (Chatham) ** Artillery *** I/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle), N/4th Brigade RA (Woolwich), M/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle) * 3rd Division (Gravesend) ** 1st Brigade (Gravesend) *** 77th Foot (Dublin), 104th Foot (Belfast), 105th Foot (Newry) ** 2nd Brigade (Chatham) *** 2nd Bn. 5th Foot (Chatham), 31st Foot (Chatham), 86th Foot (Chatham) ** Divisional Troops *** 87th Foot (Limerick), West Kent Yeomanry (Maidstone), 22nd Company Royal Engineers (Woolwich) ** Artillery *** O/4th Brigade RA (Weedon), A/5th Brigade RA (Weedon) * Cavalry Brigade (Maldon) ** 3rd Hussars (Colchester), 4th Hussars (Shorncliffe), Suffolk Yeomanry (Bury St Edmunds), F Battery C Brigade Royal Horse Artillery (Canterbury) * Corps Artillery (Colchester) ** E Battery C Brigade RHA (Woolwich), H Battery A Brigade RHA (Woolwich) ** G/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich), B/5th Brigade RA (Sheffield) * Corps Engineers (Colchester) ** A (Pontoons) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot) ** C (Telegraph) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot) ** 23rd Company Royal Engineers and Field Park (Chatham) This scheme had been dropped by 1881.Army List 1876‚Äì1881. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1891 (drawn up by Edward Stanhope when Secretary of State for War) laid down the policy that after providing for garrisons and India, the army should be able to mobilise three army corps for home defence, two of regular troops and one partly of militia, each of three divisions. Only after those commitments, it was hoped, might two army corps be organised for the unlikely eventuality of deployment abroad.Dunlop ch 2. When the Second Anglo-Boer War was imminent in September 1899, a field army, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes I Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was, in fact, 'about the equivalent of the First Army Corps of the existing mobilization scheme',Dunlop p 72. and was placed under the command of Gen Sir Redvers Buller, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Aldershot Command. However, once in South Africa the corps never operated as such, and the three divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd) were widely dispersed. The 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands (Aldershot, Southern, Irish, Eastern, Northern and Scottish) of which only I Corps (Aldershot Command) and II Corps (Southern Command on Salisbury Plain) would be entirely formed of regular troops.Dunlop pp 130-40. However, these arrangements remained theoretical, the title 'I Corps' being added to Aldershot Command. In early October 1902 a memorandum was issued showing the organization and allocation of the 1st Army Corps, to which Sir John French had recently been appointed in command: * 1st Division ** 1st Brigade (Guards) (Marlborough Lines) ** 2nd Infantry Brigade (HQ Blackdown) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 2nd Division ** 3rd Infantry Brigade (HQ Stanhope Lines) ** 4th Infantry Brigade (HQ Wellington) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 3rd Division ** 5th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon) ** 6th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 1st Cavalry Brigade (South Cavalry Barracks) In 1907 the title changed to 'Aldershot Corps' but reverted to simply 'Aldershot Command' the following year.Army List Finally, the Haldane Reforms of 1907 established a six-division British Expeditionary Force for deployment overseas, but only Aldershot Command possessed two infantry divisions and a full complement of 'army troops' to form an army corps in the field.Dunlop p 262. First World War Pre-war planning for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) did not envisage any intermediate headquarters between GHQ and the six infantry divisions, but it was assumed that if corps HQs became necessary, then the GOC Aldershot Command would automatically become GOC I Corps in the field.Neillands, p. 169. On mobilisation in August 1914 the decision was made to conform to the two-division army corps organisation employed by the French armies alongside which the BEF was to operate.Official History 1914, Volume I, p. 7. Sir Douglas Haig, then commanding at Aldershot, therefore took I Corps HQ to France with 1st Division and 2nd Division under command, and it remained on the Western Front throughout the war. It had a peripheral part at the Battle of Mons, then saw hard fighting at the Battle of the Aisne and First Battle of Ypres in 1914, at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in the Spring of 1915 and alongside the Canadian Corps at the Battle of Hill 70, as well in many other large battles of the First World War. =Composition of I Corps in First World War= The composition of army corps changed frequently. Some representative orders of battle for I Corps are given here. Order of Battle at Mons 23 August 1914Official History 1914, Volume I, Appendix 1.

Once the era of trench warfare had set in on the Western Front (1915‚Äì17), the BEF left its army corps in position for long periods, so that they became familiar with their sector, while rotating divisions as they required rest, training, or transfer to other sectors.Sanders Marble, 'Offensive versus Subsidiary Attacks, 1916‚Äì1918: The British Expeditionary Force Balancing its Options', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Volume 87, No 351 (Autumn 2009).

During the Second World War, I Corps' first assignment was again to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) where it was commanded by General Sir John Dill, and then Lieutenant General Michael Barker from April 1940. After the Germans broke through Allied lines in the Battle of France in May 1940, the BEF was forced to retreat to Dunkirk for evacuation to England. The Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, General Lord Gort, ordered Barker to form the rearguard with I Corps to cover the evacuation, and surrender to the Germans as a last resort. However, the acting commander of II Corps, Major General Bernard Montgomery, advised Gort that Barker was in an unfit state to be left in final command, and recommended that Major General Harold Alexander of the 1st Division should be put in charge. Gort did as Montgomery advised, and in the event the bulk of I Corps was successfully evacuated. As Montgomery recalled: '\\"Alex\\" got everyone away in his own calm and confident manner'.Montgomery p. 64 =Composition of I Corps in the Battle of France= The order of battle was as follows: General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant General M.G.H.

I Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General John Crocker, then took part in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 where, along with XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall (who had commanded I Corps between April and August 1943), it was a spearhead corps of Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey's British Second Army, itself part of the 21st Army Group. The corps was then involved in the Battle of Normandy in fierce attritional fighting for control of the Normandy beachhead. After fighting for two months in the Battle for Caen, I Corps was subordinated on 1 August 1944 to the Canadian First Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Crerar, for the remainder of the Normandy campaign Hart, p.19 and the subsequent operations in the Low Countries.Williams, p. 466. participating in Operation Astonia, the capture of Le Havre, and the operations to clear the Channel Coast, later helping to garrison \\"The Island\\" area between Arnhem and Nijmegen in the aftermath of the failed airborne invasion of the Netherlands, Operation Market Garden. During Operation Pheasant, I Corps was unique in that it fielded multi national divisionsm - Polish 1st Armoured Division, the Canadian 4th Armoured Division the British 49th Polar Bears Division and the US 104th Timberwolf Division. After the Battle of the Scheldt I Corps Headquarters then took over administration of the 21st Army Group's logistics area around the port of Antwerp, Belgium until the end of the war. =Composition of I Corps in NW Europe Campaign= General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant-General John Crocker * Corps troops:Forty, p 346. ** Inns of Court Regiment, Royal Armoured Corps (armoured cars) ** 62nd (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery ** 102nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA ** 9th Survey Regiment, RA ** I Corps Troops, Royal Engineers ** I Corps Signals, Royal Corps of Signals Attached: * 4th Army Group, Royal Artillery ** 150th (South Nottinghamshire Hussars Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA (suspended animation January 1945) ** 53rd (London) Medium Regiment, RA (209 & 210 (London) Batteries) ** 65th Medium Regiment, RA (222 (Fraserborough) & 223 (Banffshire) Batteries) ** 68th Medium Regiment, RA (233 & 234 Batteries) ** 79th (Scottish Horse Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery ** 51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment, RA Assignments of corps to armies, and divisions to corps, changed frequently during the campaign: As of 6 June 1944Ellis, p.181 * British 3rd Infantry Division * 3rd Canadian Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division As of 7 July 1944 * British 3rd Infantry Division * 3rd Canadian Infantry Division * 51st (Highland) Infantry Division * 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division As of 1 August 1944 (now part of First Canadian Army) * 51st (Highland) Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division (returned to United Kingdom 3 September 1944) * 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division * 7th Armoured Division British Army of the Rhine After the defeat of Germany, the 21st Army Group became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), and 1 Corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Ivor Thomas, was transformed into a corps district, with an administrative, rather than combat, role. It was disbanded in 1947.The British Army in Germany: An Organizational History 1947-2004 By Graham Watson, Richard A. Rinaldi, Page 11 Tiger Lily, 2005, However, in October 1951 the corps was reactivated to become the principal combat element of the BAOR, with its HQ based in Bielefeld. In March 1952, following the reactivation of 6th Armoured Division, its component formations were: * 2nd Infantry Division * 6th Armoured Division * 7th Armoured Division * 11th Armoured Division Included as part of this was Canada's contribution to the NATO land forces in Germany. A Canadian mechanised brigade remained part of BAOR until 1970. The size of this force, 6,700, was such that it was referred to within British circles as a \\"light division\\". In a following 1958-60 reorganisation the Corps was formed into three mixed armour/infantry divisions including five brigade groups, which were in 1965 brought together into three centralised divisions. With the end of National Service, manpower across the whole of BAOR dropped from around 77,000 to 55,000. In the late 1970s the Corps was reorganised as four small five battle group armoured divisions plus a roughly brigade sized infantry 'Field Force'. It then comprised: * 1st Armoured Division * 2nd Armoured Division * 3rd Armoured Division * 4th Armoured Division * 5th Field Force Following the 1981-3 reorganisation, the Corps consisted of 1st and 4th Armoured Divisions, which would have manned the front line against the anticipated attack by the Soviet 3rd Shock Army, plus in an in-depth, reserve role the 3rd Armoured Division and finally the 2nd Infantry Division which was tasked with rear-area security.Isby & Kamps, pp.256-258 * 1st Armoured Division ** 7th Armoured Brigade ** 12th Armoured Brigade ** 22nd Armoured Brigade * 3rd Armoured Division ** 4th Armoured Brigade ** 6th Armoured Brigade ** 33rd Armoured Brigade * 4th Armoured Division ** 11th Armoured Brigade ** 20th Armoured Brigade ** 19th Infantry Brigade (in UK) * 2nd Infantry Division (in UK) ** 15th Infantry Brigade (TA) ** 24th Airmobile Brigade ** 49th Infantry Brigade (TA) * The Artillery Division (HQ Ripon Barracks, Bielefeld) : Structure of the 1 British Corps in 1989. With the end of the Cold War, in 1992 1 (BR) Corps was disbanded, and its HQ closed. Some of the staff serving in HQ 1(BR) Corps were reassigned to the new HQ UK Support Command (Germany) which was formed from the rump of HQ BAOR. The remainder of the staff formed the British component (50% of the total staff in the HQ) in the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC), a newly instated multi-national NATO Rapid Reaction Corps HQ.

Morning glory species belong to many genera, some of which are: * Argyreia * Astripomoea * Calystegia * Convolvulus * Ipomoea * Lepistemon * Merremia * Operculina * Rivea * Stictocardia  History  Ipomoea purpurea in Loganville, Georgia Morning glory was first known in China for its medicinal uses, due to the laxative properties of its seeds. Ancient Mesoamerican civilizations used the morning glory species Ipomoea alba to convert the latex from the Castilla elastica tree and also the guayule plant to produce bouncing rubber balls. The sulfur in the morning glory's juice served to vulcanize the rubber, a process predating Charles Goodyear's discovery by at least 3,000 years. Aztec priests in Mexico were also known to use the plant's hallucinogenic properties (see Rivea corymbosa).  Behavior  Most morning glory flowers unravel into full bloom in the early morning. The flowers usually start to fade a few hours before the \\"petals\\" start showing visible curling. They prefer full solar exposure throughout the day, and mesic soils. Some morning glories, such as Ipomoea muricata, are night-blooming flowers. In some places, such as Australian bushland, some species of morning glories develop thick roots and tend to grow in dense thickets. They can quickly spread by way of long, creeping stems. By crowding out, blanketing and smothering other plants, morning glory has turned into a serious invasive weed problem.https://www.nwcb.wa.gov/pdfs/Bindweed_factsheet_King.pdf  Cultivation  In cultivation, most are treated as perennial plants in frost- free areas and as annual plants in colder climates, but some species tolerate winter cold. There are some species which are strictly annual (e.g. Ipomoea nil), producing many seeds, and some perennial species (e.g. I. indica) which are propagated by cuttings. Some moonflowers, which flower at night, are also in the morning glory family. Because of their fast growth, twining habit, attractive flowers, and tolerance for poor, dry soils, some morning glories are excellent vines for creating summer shade on building walls when trellised, thus keeping the building cooler and reducing heating and cooling costs. Popular varieties in contemporary western cultivation include 'Sunspots', 'Heavenly Blue', the moonflower, the cypress vine, and the cardinal climber. The cypress vine is a hybrid, with the cardinal climber as one parent. Many morning glories will self-seed in the garden. They have a hard seed coat which delays germination until late spring. Germination may be improved by pre-soaking in warm water.  Culinary uses  Ipomoea aquatica, known as water spinach, water morning glory, water convolvulus, ong-choy, kang-kung, or swamp cabbage, is popularly used as a green vegetable, especially in East and Southeast Asian cuisines. In the USA Ipomoea aquatica is a federal noxious weed, and can be illegal to grow, import, possess, or sell without a permit. However, a market exists for the plant's powerful culinary potential.USDA weed factsheet As of 2005, the state of Texas has acknowledged that water spinach is a highly prized vegetable in many cultures, and has allowed water spinach to be grown for personal consumption, in part because it is known to have been grown in Texas for more than 15 years and has not yet escaped cultivation. Because it goes by so many names, it can easily be slipped through import inspections, and it is often available in Asian or specialty produce markets. The genus Ipomoea also contains the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Though the term \\"morning glory\\" is not usually extended to Ipomoea batatas, sometimes it may be referred to as a tuberous morning glory in a horticultural context. Some cultivars of Ipomoea batatas are grown for their ornamental value, rather than for the edible tuber.  Chemistry and ethnobotany  The seeds of many species of morning glory contain ergoline alkaloids such as the psychedelic ergonovine and ergine (LSA). Seeds of Ipomoea tricolor and Turbina corymbosa (syn. R. corymbosa) are used as psychedelics. The seeds of morning glory can produce a similar effect to LSD when taken in large doses, often numbering into the hundreds. Though the chemical LSA is not legal in some countries, the seeds are found in many gardening stores; however, some claim the seeds from commercial sources can sometimes be coated in some kind or form of pesticide or methylmercury (although the latter is illegal in the UK and the US). These pesticide coating could be especially dangerous if one has a history of liver disorders and may also cause neural damage. For this reason, Terrence McKenna advocated growing and harvesting your own Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds to use for this purpose, and avoid any possibility of pesticide coatings.

Tribonian (Greek: Œ§œÅŒπŒ≤œâŒΩŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ [trivonia'nos], c. 485?‚Äì542) was a notable Byzantine jurist and advisor, who during the reign of the Emperor Justinian I, supervised the revision of the legal code of the Byzantine Empire.Roman Jurisprudence . Tribonian was born in Side, in Pamphylia, around the year 500.\\"We can only guess at the date of his birth....Tribonian attained the quaestorship in 529, so he was presumably born before 500, perhaps in the last fifteen years of the fifth century.\\" Tony Honor√©, Tribonian (1978), 41. He was well educated and practiced law before the court of the praetorian prefect.Honor√©, 44. Justinian made Tribonian magister officiorum (Master of Offices), although it is not clear when,Honor√©, 45 and then appointed him quaestor sacri palatii in September 529.Tony Honor√©, \\"Tribonian\\" in The Oxford Classical Dictionary 1549 (Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth eds. 3rd rev. ed 2003). In 528, before he was appointed quaestor, Tribonian was named by Justinian as one of the commissioners charged with preparing the new imperial legal code, the Codex Justinianeus, which subsequently was issued on April 7, 529.Honor√©, supra note 2 at 44-46. In 530, after Tribonian had become quaestor, it was natural for Justinian to put him in charge of the next major law reform project: compiling and harmonizing the writings of classical Roman jurists. Justinian's main objects in creating this harmonized compilation of juristic writings were to shorten litigation (by clarifying the law), and to create a syllabus to be used at the law schools in Berytus (Beirut) and Constantinople.Tony Honor√©, \\"Justinian's Codification\\" in The Oxford Classical Dictionary 803, 804 (Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth eds. 3rd rev. ed 2003). For a lengthier discussion of the purpose of the second Commission, see Honor√©, supra note 2 at 48-50. During the same period, Tribonian also was charged with carrying out another aspect of Justinian's reforms in legal education and codification ‚Äî creating a textbook for first-year law students by updating the Institutes of Gaius. Both the Digest and the new Institutes of Justinian were promulgated in December of 533.Honor√©, \\"Justinian's Codification, supra note 8. In 534, Justinian decided that so many new laws had been passed, and so many older ones harmonized, since the publication of his first Code in 529, a second edition was needed. Hence, the Codex repetitae praelectionis was published, entirely superseding the edition of 529, the text of which has been lost.Id. In 532 Tribonian was removed as quaestor due to the charges made by his enemies during the Nika riots, but he continued to work on the codification.Honor√©, supra note 2 at 48. He was restored to his post as quaestor in 535 and continued in that position until his death.Honor√©, supra note 5. Tribonian continued to help draft new laws for Justinian; these new laws (Novellae Constitutiones) were later combined with the Codex Justinianus, the Digest and the Institutes to comprise the Corpus Juris Civilis. Tribonian died in 542 of a disease, perhaps the plague.See Honor√©, supra note 2 at 61-64 for a detailed sifting of the evidence. Tribonian's career is summarized by his noted modern biographer, Tony Honor√©, in this way: \\"...he was Justinian's minister for legislation and propaganda for nearly twelve years...In these years the three volumes of the Corpus Juris Civilis and most of the surviving legislation of Justinian's reign were produced. He drafted about three-quarters of the surviving constitutions of Justinian's reign. He planned and directed the work of the Second Law Commission, which produced the Digest, the Institutes and the Second \\"Codex Iustinianus.\\"Honor√©, supra note 8 at 69.

Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217‚Äì219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han ‚Äì founded by Liu Bei in 221 ‚Äì in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life have been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction. In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. Historical sources on Zhao Yun's life Zhao Yun's original biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), written by Chen Shou in the third century, is only 346 Chinese characters long. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi added annotations from the Zhao Yun Biezhuan (Ë∂ôÈõ≤Âà•ÂÇ≥; Unofficial Biography of Zhao Yun) to Zhao Yun's biography in the Sanguozhi, providing a relatively clear, though still incomplete picture of Zhao Yun's life.

Sometime in 209, Liu Bei married Sun Quan's younger sister, Lady Sun, to strengthen the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance. Lady Sun also remained in Jing Province when Liu Bei left for Yi Province. As she saw herself as the sister of a powerful warlord, Lady Sun not only acted in an arrogant and unbridled manner, but also allowed her bodyguards and personal staff to behave lawlessly in Jing Province. For this reason, Liu Bei specially appointed Zhao Yun, whom he deemed a serious and conscientious person, to oversee domestic affairs in Jing Province and maintain law and order during his absence.(Ê≠§ÊôÇÂÖà‰∏ªÂ≠´Â§´‰∫∫‰ª•Ê¨äÂ¶πÈ©ïË±™ÔºåÂ§öÂ∞áÂê≥ÂêèÂÖµÔºåÁ∏±Ê©´‰∏çÊ≥ï„ÄÇÂÖà‰∏ª‰ª•Èõ≤Âö¥ÈáçÔºåÂøÖËÉΩÊï¥ÈΩäÔºåÁâπ‰ªªÊéåÂÖß‰∫ã„ÄÇ) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36.

Liu Bei was initially stationed at Jiameng Pass (Ëë≠ËêåÈóú; in present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan), where he was helping Liu Zhang defend the area from Zhang Lu. However, he turned against Liu Zhang later and attacked him. He ordered Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and others to lead reinforcements from Jing Province into Yi Province to help him, while Guan Yu remained behind to defend Jing Province.(ÂÖà‰∏ªËªçÁõäÂº∑ÔºåÂàÜÈÅ£Ë´∏Â∞áÂπ≥‰∏ãÂ±¨Á∏£ÔºåË´∏Ëëõ‰∫Æ„ÄÅÂºµÈ£õ„ÄÅË∂ôÈõ≤Á≠âÂ∞áÂÖµÊ∫ØÊµÅÂÆöÁôΩÂ∏ù„ÄÅÊ±üÂ∑û„ÄÅÊ±üÈôΩÔºåÊÉüÈóúÁæΩÁïôÈéÆËçäÂ∑û„ÄÇÂÖà‰∏ªÈÄ≤ËªçÂúçÈõíÔºõÊôÇÁíãÂ≠êÂæ™ÂÆàÂüéÔºåË¢´Êîª‰∏î‰∏ÄÂπ¥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 32.

Liu Bei's general Huang Zhong killed Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan at the Battle of Mount Dingjun of 218‚Äì219. After Xiahou Yuan's defeat, Huang Zhong heard that enemy troops were transporting food supplies in the vicinity so he led a detachment of troops to attack the convoy and seize the supplies.(Â§è‰æØÊ∑µÊïóÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨Áà≠Êº¢‰∏≠Âú∞ÔºåÈÅãÁ±≥ÂåóÂ±±‰∏ãÔºåÊï∏ÂçÉËê¨Âõä„ÄÇÈªÉÂø†‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂèØÂèñÔºåÈõ≤ÂÖµÈö®Âø†ÂèñÁ±≥„ÄÇ) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36.

At the time, Cao Cao had sent his forces to attack Liu Bei's positions. Zhao Yun encountered Cao Cao's vanguard force and engaged them in battle until Cao Cao's main force showed up and surrounded him. Despite the overwhelming odds, Zhao Yun attempted to charge and break through the enemy formation and alternated between fighting back and retreating. Cao Cao's forces regrouped, got back into formation and surrounded Zhao Yun. Left with no choice, Zhao Yun had to fight his way out and head back to camp. During the battle, Zhao Yun's deputy Zhang Zhu () was wounded but Zhao Yun turned back, saved him and brought him back to camp.(ÂÄºÊõπÂÖ¨ÊèöÂÖµÂ§ßÂá∫ÔºåÈõ≤ÁÇ∫ÂÖ¨ÂâçÈãíÊâÄÊìäÔºåÊñπÊà∞ÔºåÂÖ∂Â§ßË°ÜËá≥ÔºåÂã¢ÈÄºÔºåÈÅÇÂâçÁ™ÅÂÖ∂Èô£Ôºå‰∏îÈ¨¨‰∏îÂç¥„ÄÇÂÖ¨ËªçÊï£ÔºåÂ∑≤Âæ©ÂêàÔºåÈõ≤Èô∑ÊïµÔºåÈÇÑË∂£Âúç„ÄÇÂ∞áÂºµËëóË¢´ÂâµÔºåÈõ≤Âæ©È¶≥È¶¨ÈÇÑÁáüËøéËëó„ÄÇ) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Cao Cao's forces pursued Zhao Yun as he retreated back to his camp. Upon seeing the enemy's approach, Zhao Yun's subordinate Zhang Yi wanted to shut the camp's gates and get the troops to hold their position. However, Zhao Yun ordered the gates to be opened, all flags and banners to be hidden, and the war drums to be silenced so as to create an illusion of an empty camp.(ÂÖ¨ËªçËøΩËá≥ÂúçÔºåÊ≠§ÊôÇÊ≤îÈôΩÈï∑ÂºµÁøºÂú®Èõ≤ÂúçÂÖßÔºåÁøºÊ¨≤ÈñâÈñÄÊãíÂÆàÔºåËÄåÈõ≤ÂÖ•ÁáüÔºåÊõ¥Â§ßÈñãÈñÄÔºåÂÅÉÊóóÊÅØÈºì„ÄÇ) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Cao Cao's forces thought that there was an ambush inside Zhao Yun's camp so they withdrew. Just as they were retreating, Zhao Yun launched a counterattack and his men beat the war drums loudly and fired arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao's soldiers were shocked and thrown into disarray.

Guan Yu was later captured in an ambush and executed on Sun Quan's order when he refused to surrender. Following Cao Cao's death in March 220, his son and successor Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian later that year, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Wei with himself as the new emperor. In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu to challenge Wei's legitimacy. In the same year, Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi and agreed to become a vassal under Wei; in return, Cao Pi granted him the title \\"King of Wu\\".

Following his coronation, Liu Shan appointed Zhao Yun as Central Protector of the Army () and General Who Attacks the South (), and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Yongchang Village ().

Born in Ji County (present-day Gangu County, Gansu), Jiang Wei started his career as a military officer in his native Tianshui Commandery, which was a territory of Wei. In 228, when Wei's rival state Shu launched an invasion led by Zhuge Liang, Jiang Wei was distrusted by Ma Zun, then administrator of Tianshui Commandery. As such, Jiang Wei had to defect to Shu. Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Shu, highly regarded Jiang Wei and appointed him as a general in Shu. After Zhuge Liang's death in 234, Jiang Wei continued serving as a military commander during the regencies Jiang Wan and Fei Yi, eventually rising to the highest military rank of General-In-Chief (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç) after Fei Yi‚Äôs death in 253. Between 240 and 262, he continued Zhuge Liang's legacy of waging war against Wei by leading another 11 military campaigns. However, Jiang Wei‚Äôs campaigns were relatively constrained in terms of both scale and duration due to Shu‚Äôs limited resources and inadequate food supplies, as well as internal political faultlines. In 263, when Wei launched a massive invasion of Shu, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to resist the invaders at Tazhong, Yinping and Jiange, himself defending Jiange which was under Zhong Hui‚Äôs attack. While Jiang Wei managed to temporarily stall Wei‚Äôs main force led by Zhong Hui, Deng Ai, another military commander of Wei, took a shortcut via Yinping and showed up at Chengdu unexpectedly. Liu Shan surrendered to Deng Ai without putting up resistance and ordered Jiang Wei to surrender to the Wei general Zhong Hui; this event marked the end of Shu's existence. In the following year, Jiang Wei instigated Zhong Hui to launch a rebellion in Chengdu against the Wei regent Sima Zhao and hoped to use the opportunity to gain military power and restore Shu. However, some of Zhong Hui's officers were unwilling to participate in the rebellion and started a mutiny, killing Jiang Wei and Zhong Hui. Family background Jiang Wei was from Ji County (ÂÜÄÁ∏£/ÂÖæÁ∏£), Tianshui Commandery (Â§©Ê∞¥ÈÉ°), which is present-day Gangu County, Gansu.(ÂßúÁ∂≠Â≠ó‰ºØÁ¥ÑÔºåÂ§©Ê∞¥ÂÖæ‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

Defection to Shu =Sanguozhi account= In the spring of 228, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Wei's rival state Shu, launched the first of a series of military campaigns against Wei. He occupied Mount Qi (Á•ÅÂ±±; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) and deployed his troops there in orderly formations. Three Wei-controlled commanderies ‚Äì Nan'an (ÂçóÂÆâ; around present-day Longxi County, Gansu), Tianshui and Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu) ‚Äì responded to the invasion by defecting to the Shu side. Jiang Wei's biography in the Sanguozhi recorded that at the time, Jiang Wei and his colleagues Liang Xu, Yin Shang and Liang Qian were out on an inspection tour with Ma Zun (È¶¨ÈÅµ), the Administrator of Tianshui Commandery. When Ma Zun learnt of the Shu invasion and heard that many counties in Tianshui Commandery had defected to the enemy, he suspected that Jiang Wei and the others were going to betray him so he fled overnight and took shelter in Shanggui County (‰∏äÈÇΩÁ∏£; within present-day Tianshui, Gansu).(Âª∫ËààÂÖ≠Âπ¥Ôºå‰∏ûÁõ∏Ë´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆËªçÂêëÁ•ÅÂ±±ÔºåÊôÇÂ§©Ê∞¥Â§™ÂÆàÈÅ©Âá∫Ê°àË°åÔºåÁ∂≠ÂèäÂäüÊõπÊ¢ÅÁ∑í„ÄÅ‰∏ªÁ∞øÂ∞πË≥û„ÄÅ‰∏ªË®òÊ¢ÅËôîÁ≠âÂæûË°å„ÄÇÂ§™ÂÆàËÅûËúÄËªçÂûÇËá≥ÔºåËÄåË´∏Á∏£ÈüøÊáâÔºåÁñëÁ∂≠Á≠âÁöÜÊúâÁï∞ÂøÉÔºåÊñºÊòØÂ§ú‰∫°‰øù‰∏äÈÇΩ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44. By the time Jiang Wei and his colleagues realised that Ma Zun had abandoned them and fled on his own, they attempted to catch up with him but it was too late. They were denied entry when they showed up at Shanggui County, so Jiang Wei led them to his home county, Ji County (ÂÜÄÁ∏£/ÂÖæÁ∏£; present-day Gangu County, Gansu). However, the official in charge of Ji County also refused to allow them to enter. Faced with no other choice, Jiang Wei and his colleagues surrendered and defected to Shu.(Á∂≠Á≠âË¶∫Â§™ÂÆàÂéªÔºåËøΩÈÅ≤ÔºåËá≥ÂüéÈñÄÔºåÂüéÈñÄÂ∑≤ÈñâÔºå‰∏çÁ¥ç„ÄÇÁ∂≠Á≠âÁõ∏ÁéáÈÇÑÂÖæÔºåÂÖæ‰∫¶‰∏çÂÖ•Á∂≠„ÄÇÁ∂≠Á≠â‰πÉ‰ø±Ë©£Ë´∏Ëëõ‰∫Æ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44. =Alternative account in the Weil√ºe= The Weil√ºe recorded a different account of Jiang Wei's defection from Wei to Shu. At the time of the Shu invasion, Ma Zun and his subordinates (including Jiang Wei) were on an inspection tour with the Wei general Guo Huai when they received news that Zhuge Liang and the Shu army had occupied Mount Qi. After telling Ma Zun that Zhuge Liang was \\"up to no good\\", Guo Huai wanted to quickly head back to Shanggui County in the east of Tianshui Commandery. Even though his headquarters was at Ji County in the west, Ma Zun did not want to go back because he feared that there would be unrest in Ji County in light of the Shu invasion. He decided to join Guo Huai and move to Shanggui County instead.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÂ§©Ê∞¥Â§™ÂÆàÈ¶¨ÈÅµÂ∞áÁ∂≠ÂèäË´∏ÂÆòÂ±¨Èö®ÈõçÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÈÉ≠Ê∑ÆÂÅ∂Ëá™Ë•øËá≥Ê¥õÈñÄÊ°àË°åÔºåÊúÉËÅû‰∫ÆÂ∑≤Âà∞Á•ÅÂ±±ÔºåÊ∑ÆÈ°ßÈÅµÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊòØÊ¨≤‰∏çÂñÑÔºÅ„ÄçÈÅÇÈ©ÖÊù±ÈÇÑ‰∏äÈÇΩ„ÄÇÈÅµÂøµÊâÄÊ≤ªÂÖæÁ∏£ÁïåÂú®Ë•øÂÅèÔºåÂèàÊÅêÂêèÊ∞ëÊ®Ç‰∫ÇÔºåÈÅÇ‰∫¶Èö®Ê∑ÆÂéª„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. When Jiang Wei urged Ma Zun to return to Ji County, the latter told him and the others: \\"If you go back, then you will become my enemy.\\" Jiang Wei ignored Ma Zun because he was worried about the safety of his family in Ji County, so he parted ways with Ma Zun and returned to Ji County with his colleague Shangguan Zixiu (‰∏äÂÆòÂ≠êËÑ©) and others.(ÊôÇÁ∂≠Ë¨ÇÈÅµÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊòéÂ∫úÁï∂ÈÇÑÂÖæ„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅµË¨ÇÁ∂≠Á≠âÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂçøË´∏‰∫∫[Âõû]Âæ©‰ø°ÔºåÁöÜË≥ä‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂêÑËá™Ë°å„ÄÇÁ∂≠‰∫¶ÁÑ°Â¶ÇÈÅµ‰ΩïÔºåËÄåÂÆ∂Âú®ÂÖæÔºåÈÅÇËàáÈÉ°Âêè‰∏äÂÆòÂ≠êËÑ©Á≠âÈÇÑÂÖæ„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. When Jiang Wei returned to Ji County, the people welcomed him back and insisted that he meet Zhuge Liang. Jiang Wei and Shangguan Zixiu relented and went to see Zhuge Liang, who was delighted to meet them. By the time Jiang Wei wanted to go back to Ji County to fetch his family members (mother, wife and child(ren)), Wei forces under Zhang He and Fei Yao had defeated the Shu vanguard at the Battle of Jieting. Unable to return to Ji County and left with no other option, Jiang Wei decided to defect to Shu and follow Zhuge Liang. After Wei forces recaptured Ji County, they took Jiang Wei's family members captive but did not execute them because they knew that Jiang Wei did not originally intend to defect to the enemy. Jiang Wei's family members thus spent the rest of their lives in prison.(ÂÖæ‰∏≠ÂêèÊ∞ëË¶ãÁ∂≠Á≠âÂ§ßÂñúÔºå‰æøÊé®‰ª§Ë¶ã‰∫Æ„ÄÇ‰∫å‰∫∫‰∏çÁç≤Â∑≤Ôºå‰πÉÂÖ±Ë©£‰∫Æ„ÄÇ‰∫ÆË¶ãÔºåÂ§ßÊÅ±„ÄÇÊú™ÂèäÈÅ£ËøéÂÖæ‰∏≠‰∫∫ÔºåÊúÉ‰∫ÆÂâçÈãíÁÇ∫ÂºµÈÉÉ„ÄÅË≤ªÁπáÁ≠âÊâÄÁ†¥ÔºåÈÅÇÂ∞áÁ∂≠Á≠âÂç¥Á∏Æ„ÄÇÁ∂≠‰∏çÂæóÈÇÑÔºåÈÅÇÂÖ•ËúÄ„ÄÇË´∏ËªçÊîªÂÖæÔºåÁöÜÂæóÁ∂≠ÊØçÂ¶ªÂ≠êÔºå‰∫¶‰ª•Á∂≠Êú¨ÁÑ°ÂéªÊÑèÔºåÊïÖ‰∏çÊ≤íÂÖ∂ÂÆ∂Ôºå‰ΩÜÁπ´‰øùÂÆò‰ª•Âª∂‰πã„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44.

One theory says that Jiang Wei had secretly recruited Guo Xiu as an assassin after capturing him in battle, and ordered him to find an opportunity to murder Fei Yi. Jiang Wei's motive for taking Fei Yi's life, according to the theory, was that he needed to eliminate Fei Yi as a potential threat because Fei Yi had been opposing his hawkish stance towards Wei. Regardless of whether or not Jiang Wei plotted Fei Yi's assassination, Fei Yi's death did allow Jiang Wei to gain greater control over the Shu military and continue waging war against Wei.

In response to the Shu invasion, the Wei regent Sima Shi ordered his generals Guo Huai and Chen Tai to lead the Wei forces stationed in the Guanzhong region to attack the invaders and lift the siege on Didao. Chen Tai attacked the Shu forces at Luomen (Ê¥õÈñÄ; in present-day Wushan County, Gansu) and defeated them. Jiang Wei eventually withdrew all his forces and retreated back to Shu when they ran out of food supplies.([Âª∂ÁÜôÂçÅÂÖ≠Âπ¥]Â§èÔºåÁ∂≠ÁéáÂ∞áÊï∏Ëê¨‰∫∫Âá∫Áü≥ÁáüÔºåÁ∂ìËë£‰∫≠ÔºåÂúçÂçóÂÆâÔºåÈ≠èÈõçÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤Èô≥Ê≥∞Ëß£ÂúçËá≥Ê¥õÈñÄÔºåÁ∂≠Á≥ßÁõ°ÈÄÄÈÇÑ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44. =Seventh Northern Expedition= In the summer of 254, after the Shu government granted him authority to oversee internal and external military affairs, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Longxi Commandery again. Li Jian (ÊùéÁ∞°), the Wei official in charge of Didao (ÁãÑÈÅì; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu), surrendered to Jiang Wei. Jiang Wei then pressed further to attack Xiangwu County (Ë•ÑÊ≠¶Á∏£; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) and engaged the Wei general Xu Zhi in battle. Xu Zhi was defeated and killed, but the Shu army also lost a general, Zhang Ni. The victorious Shu forces then occupied three counties ‚Äì Didao, Heguan (Ê≤≥Èóú; in the vicinity of present-day Dingxi, Gansu) and Lintao ‚Äì and forced the residents to relocate to Shu-controlled territory.([ÂçÅ‰∏ÉÂπ¥]Â§èÂÖ≠ÊúàÔºåÁ∂≠Âæ©ÁéáË°ÜÂá∫Èö¥Ë•ø„ÄÇÂÜ¨ÔºåÊãîÁãÑÈÅì„ÄÅÊ≤≥Èñì„ÄÅËá®Ê¥Æ‰∏âÁ∏£Ê∞ëÔºåÂ±Ö‰∫éÁ∑úÁ´π„ÄÅÁπÅÁ∏£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 33.(ÊòéÂπ¥ÔºåÂä†Áù£‰∏≠Â§ñËªç‰∫ã„ÄÇÂæ©Âá∫Èö¥Ë•øÔºåÂÆàÁãÑÈÅìÈï∑ÊùéÁ∞°ËàâÂüéÈôç„ÄÇÈÄ≤ÂúçË•ÑÊ≠¶ÔºåËàáÈ≠èÂ∞áÂæêË≥™‰∫§ÈãíÔºåÊñ¨È¶ñÁ†¥ÊïµÔºåÈ≠èËªçÊïóÈÄÄ„ÄÇÁ∂≠‰πòÂãùÂ§öÊâÄÈôç‰∏ãÔºåÊãîÊ≤≥Èñì„ÄÅÁãÑÈÅì„ÄÅËá®Ê¥Æ‰∏âÁ∏£Ê∞ëÈÇÑÔºå ...)

In the meantime, Chen Tai, Deng Ai, Sima Fu and other Wei officers led reinforcements to Didao to save Wang Jing. Chen Tai led his troops to the hills southeast of Didao, where they lit more fires and beat their war drums loudly to let the Wei forces in Didao know that reinforcements were on the way. As a result, the Wei forces in Didao experienced a surge in morale, and the Shu forces were taken by surprise. At the same time, Chen Tai also spread false news that they were planning to cut off the Shu army's retreat route. When Jiang Wei heard about it, he became fearful so on 11 November 255 he withdrew all the Shu forces and retreated to Zhongti (ÈêòÂ†§; south of present-day Lintao County, Gansu).(È≠èÂæÅË•øÂ∞áËªçÈô≥Ê≥∞ÈÄ≤ÂÖµËß£ÂúçÔºåÁ∂≠Âç¥‰ΩèÈçæÈ°å„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44. =Ninth Northern Expedition= In the spring of 256, the Shu emperor Liu Shan promoted Jiang Wei to the position of General-in-Chief (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç).([Âª∂ÁÜô]ÂçÅ‰πùÂπ¥Êò•ÔºåÂ∞±ÈÅ∑Á∂≠ÁÇ∫Â§ßÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

Jiang Wei then attacked Deng Ai at Mount Wucheng (Ê≠¶ÂüéÂ±±; in present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi) but was driven back. Later, he led his troops across the Wei River to launch a coordinated strike on Shanggui County (‰∏äÈÇΩÁ∏£; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu) with another Shu force led by Hu Ji. However, Hu Ji failed to show up in time so Jiang Wei came under attack by Deng Ai and his army sustained heavy casualties.(Êõ¥Êï¥ÂãíÊàéÈ¶¨ÔºåËàáÈéÆË•øÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçËÉ°ÊøüÊúüÊúÉ‰∏äÈÇΩÔºåÊøüÂ§±Ë™ì‰∏çËá≥ÔºåÊïÖÁ∂≠ÁÇ∫È≠èÂ§ßÂ∞áÈÑßËâæÊâÄÁ†¥ÊñºÊÆµË∞∑ÔºåÊòüÊï£ÊµÅÈõ¢ÔºåÊ≠ªËÄÖÁîöË°Ü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44. As the Northern Expeditions took a huge toll on Shu's population and resources, the people increasingly resented Jiang Wei for his warmongering behaviour. In order to appease public anger, Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court to take full responsibility for the failure of the ninth Northern Expedition and requested to be demoted as punishment. Liu Shan approved Jiang Wei's request and demoted him to the position of General of the Rear (ÂæåÂ∞áËªç) but allowed him to remain as acting General-in-Chief (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç).(Ë°ÜÂ∫∂Áî±ÊòØÊÄ®ËÆüÔºåËÄåÈö¥Â∑≤Ë•ø‰∫¶È®∑Âãï‰∏çÂØßÔºåÁ∂≠Ë¨ùÈÅéÂºïË≤†ÔºåÊ±ÇËá™Ë≤∂Ââä„ÄÇÁÇ∫ÂæåÂ∞áËªçÔºåË°åÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç‰∫ã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44. =Tenth Northern Expedition= In 257, when the Wei general Zhuge Dan started a rebellion in Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Jiang Wei decided to take advantage of the situation to stage another invasion of Wei. He led Shu forces to attack the Wei garrisons near the Great Wall which were well- stocked with supplies but poorly defended.

Jiang Wei then retreated to Mangshui (ËäíÊ∞¥; southeast of present-day Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi) and set up a camp there with its back facing a mountain. When the Wei forces encircled his position, Jiang Wei tried to taunt them to attack his camp but Sima Wang and Deng Ai ordered their troops to ignore the enemy and refrain from attacking.(È≠èÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂè∏È¶¨ÊúõÊãí‰πãÔºåÈÑßËâæ‰∫¶Ëá™Èö¥Âè≥ÔºåÁöÜËªç‰∫éÈï∑Âüé„ÄÇÁ∂≠Ââç‰ΩèËäíÊ∞¥ÔºåÁöÜÂÄöÂ±±ÁÇ∫Ááü„ÄÇÊúõ„ÄÅËâæÂÇçÊ∏≠Â†ÖÂúçÔºåÁ∂≠Êï∏‰∏ãÊåëÊà∞ÔºåÊúõ„ÄÅËâæ‰∏çÊáâ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

However, despite leading eleven campaigns against Wei, he had not made any significant achievements. While he was away at the frontline, the palace eunuch Huang Hao, whom the emperor Liu Shan favoured, gradually gained power in the Shu government and dominated the political scene. Huang Hao had a close partnership with the Shu general Yan Yu (ÈñªÂÆá) and he considered replacing Jiang Wei with Yan Yu as General-in- Chief.(Á∂≠Êú¨ÁæàÊóÖË®óÂúãÔºåÁ¥ØÂπ¥ÊîªÊà∞ÔºåÂäüÁ∏æ‰∏çÁ´ãÔºåËÄåÂÆ¶Ëá£ÈªÉÁöìÁ≠âÂºÑÊ¨äÊñºÂÖßÔºåÂè≥Â§ßÂ∞áËªçÈñªÂÆáËàáÁöìÊÅäÊØîÔºåËÄåÁöìÈô∞Ê¨≤Âª¢Á∂≠Ê®πÂÆá„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

The Chronicles of Huayang recorded that Jiang Wei hated Huang Hao for his power-grabbing behaviour and once advised Liu Shan to execute the eunuch. However, Liu Shan refused and said: \\"Huang Hao is but a servant running errands for me. In the past, I was annoyed by Dong Yun's deep hatred of him. Sir, why do you need to take this so personally?\\" Jiang Wei soon realised that he had a mistake in advising Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao because Huang Hao had strong influence in the Shu government, so he quickly excused himself and left. Liu Shan later instructed Huang Hao to visit Jiang Wei and apologise to him. Jiang Wei also managed to convince Huang Hao to let him remain in Tazhong to oversee agricultural production. His true intention, however, was to avoid getting caught up in a power struggle with Huang Hao in Chengdu.(ËèØÈôΩÂúãÂøóÊõ∞ÔºõÁ∂≠ÊÉ°ÈªÉÁöìÊÅ£ÊìÖÔºåÂïüÂæå‰∏ªÊ¨≤ÊÆ∫‰πã„ÄÇÂæå‰∏ªÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁöìË∂®Ëµ∞Â∞èËá£ËÄ≥ÔºåÂæÄËë£ÂÖÅÂàáÈΩíÔºåÂêæÂ∏∏ÊÅ®‰πãÔºåÂêõ‰ΩïË∂≥‰ªãÊÑèÔºÅ„ÄçÁ∂≠Ë¶ãÁöìÊûùÈôÑËëâÈÄ£ÔºåÊáºÊñºÂ§±Ë®ÄÔºåÈÅúËæ≠ËÄåÂá∫„ÄÇÂæå‰∏ªÂãëÁöìË©£Á∂≠Èô≥Ë¨ù„ÄÇÁ∂≠Ë™™ÁöìÊ±ÇÊ≤ì‰∏≠Á®ÆÈ∫•Ôºå‰ª•ÈÅøÂÖßÈÄºÁàæ„ÄÇ) Huayang Guo Zhi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44.

However, around noon on 3 March 264, some Wei officers who were unwilling to participate in the rebellion started a mutiny against Zhong Hui. At the time, Jiang Wei was collecting his armour and weapons from Zhong Hui when they heard shouting and received news that a fire had broken out. Moments later, it was reported that many soldiers were crowding near the city gates. Zhong Hui was surprised and he asked Jiang Wei: \\"Those men are causing trouble.

Zhong Hui then ordered his men to kill the officers who refused to participate in the rebellion. A while later, there were reports of people climbing up the city gates on ladders and of people setting fire to buildings. Chaos broke out and arrows were fired in all directions. The mutinying officers regrouped with their men and attacked Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei. Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei fought the mutinying soldiers and slew about five or six of them, but were eventually overwhelmed and killed.(ÊúÉÈÅ£ÂÖµÊÇâÊÆ∫ÊâÄÈñâË´∏ÁâôÈñÄÈÉ°ÂÆàÔºåÂÖß‰∫∫ÂÖ±ËàâÊú∫‰ª•Êü±ÈñÄÔºåÂÖµÊñ´ÈñÄÔºå‰∏çËÉΩÁ†¥„ÄÇÊñØÈ†àÔºåÈñÄÂ§ñÂÄöÊ¢ØÁôªÂüéÔºåÊàñÁáíÂüéÂ±ãÔºåËüªÈôÑ‰∫ÇÈÄ≤ÔºåÁü¢‰∏ãÂ¶ÇÈõ®ÔºåÁâôÈñÄ„ÄÅÈÉ°ÂÆàÂêÑÁ∑£Â±ãÂá∫ÔºåËàáÂÖ∂ÂçíÂÖµÁõ∏Âæó„ÄÇÂßúÁ∂≠ÁéáÊúÉÂ∑¶Âè≥Êà∞ÔºåÊâãÊÆ∫‰∫îÂÖ≠‰∫∫ÔºåË°ÜÊó£Ê†ºÊñ¨Á∂≠ÔºåÁà≠Ëµ¥ÊÆ∫ÊúÉ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28.

Appraisal In his modern Chinese edition of the 11th-century historical text Zizhi Tongjian, the Taiwan-based Chinese historian Boyang mentioned that Jiang Wei was a highly controversial figure in Chinese history. He cited seven writers (Xi Zheng, Sun Sheng, Chen Shou, He Zhuo, Gan Bao, Wang Mingsheng and Pei Songzhi) who held different and discordant views of Jiang Wei. Boyang himself, however, declined to comment but later shared in an open letter to a reader that he agreed with all seven views: Jiang Wei committed a fatal error in draining Shu's resources but he was also a loyal general who was willing to sacrifice himself in a futile attempt to restore Shu. =Zhuge Liang's views= Zhuge Liang once told Zhang Yi and Jiang Wan: On another occasion, Zhuge Liang said: =Xi Zheng's views= Xi Zheng, a scholar from Shu who later served as an official under the Jin dynasty, commented on Jiang Wei as follows: =Sun Sheng's views= The Jin dynasty historian Sun Sheng responded to Xi Zheng's comments on Jiang Wei as follows: In his Jin Yang Qiu (ÊôâÈôΩÁßã), Sun Sheng also wrote: =Chen Shou's views= Chen Shou, the Jin dynasty historian who wrote Jiang Wei's biography in the Sanguozhi, appraised Jiang Wei as follows: =He Zhuo's views= The Qing dynasty writer He Zhuo (‰ΩïÁÑØ) wrote: =Gan Bao's views= The Jin dynasty historian Gan Bao wrote: =Wang Mingsheng's views= The Qing dynasty historian Wang Mingsheng (ÁéãÈ≥¥Áõõ) wrote: =Pei Songzhi's views= The Liu Song dynasty historian Pei Songzhi, who annotated the Sanguozhi, commented on Jiang Wei as follows: Pei Songzhi also rebutted Sun Sheng's response to Xi Zheng's comments on Jiang Wei: =Miscellaneous= The Shiyu (‰∏ñË™û) recorded that Jiang Wei had no equal among the talented persons serving in the Shu government during his time.(‰∏ñË™ûÊõ∞ÔºöÊôÇËúÄÂÆòÂ±¨ÁöÜÂ§©‰∏ãËã±‰øäÔºåÁÑ°Âá∫Á∂≠Âè≥„ÄÇ) Shiyu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Jiang Wei, as he appears in Dynasty Warriors 5. Jiang Wei is a major character in the later chapters of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events and figures of the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period of China. In the novel, he is depicted as Zhuge Liang's prot√©g√© and successor who inherits the legacy of leading Shu into war against Wei with the aim of restoring the fallen Eastern Han dynasty. Jiang Wei first appears in Chapters 92 and 93 as a Wei military officer serving in Tianshui Commandery during Zhuge Liang's first Northern Expedition. When Zhuge Liang tries to trick Ma Zun, the Administrator of Tianshui, to lead his troops out of Tianshui to save the Wei general Xiahou Mao in Nan'an Commandery, Jiang Wei sees through Zhuge Liang's ruse and advises Ma Zun to remain in Tianshui and set a trap for the enemy. When the Shu general Zhao Yun shows up to take Tianshui, he falls into the trap and briefly duels with Jiang Wei before Shu reinforcements arrive and save him. Zhao Yun tells Zhuge Liang that he is impressed that Tianshui has such a talent like Jiang Wei. When Jiang Wei successfully repels another Shu attack, Zhuge Liang is even more impressed and eager to recruit Jiang Wei to serve in Shu. He tricks Ma Zun into believing that Jiang Wei has defected to Shu in order to prevent Jiang Wei from going back to Wei, and then springs a trap for Jiang Wei. When Jiang Wei gets cornered, he attempts suicide but Zhuge Liang stops him and manages to convince him to surrender and join Shu.Sanguo Yanyi chs. 92-93. Jiang Wei accompanies Zhuge Liang on his subsequent Northern Expeditions. Chapters 107 to 115 dramatise Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions and refer to them as Jiang Wei's \\"Nine Campaigns on the Central Plains\\"Sanguo Yanyi chs. 107-115. when historically there were actually eleven campaigns instead of nine. In Chapter 119, Jiang Wei instigates Zhong Hui to launch a rebellion against Wei, but their rebellion fails when some of Zhong Hui's officers start a mutiny against their superior. Cornered by the enemy, Jiang Wei sighs, \\"It is Heaven's will that my plan doesn't succeed!\\" He then commits suicide by slitting his throat.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 119. A verse from the novel in Jiang Wei's honour reads: In popular culture Jiang Wei appears as a playable character in the video game series Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi produced by Koei Tecmo. In the games, he is portrayed as a young warrior fiercely devoted to his mentor Zhuge Liang. He also appears in Koei Tecmo's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. Memorials and relics A Jiang Wei Memorial Museum (ÂßúÁ∂≠Á¥ÄÂøµÈ§®) was constructed in 1999 near Jiang Wei's hometown in the east of Gangu County, Tianshui, Gansu. The museum, covering an area of 360 square metres, was funded by the locals. Among other things, it contains a four-metre-tall statue of Jiang Wei in the main hall, as well as a stone tablet inscribed with the words \\"Jiang Wei's hometown\\" in calligraphy by the general Yang Chengwu. The Pingxiang Tower (Âπ≥Ë•ÑÊ•º) in present- day Lushan County, Sichuan is a 24-metre-tall building commemorating Jiang Wei. Its name comes from Jiang Wei's peerage, the Marquis of Pingxiang (Âπ≥Ë•Ñ‰æØ). The tower was built during the Song dynasty, renovated in 1445 during the Ming dynasty, and designated as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level by China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 2006. There are a number of relics related to Jiang Wei at Jianmen Pass in present-day Jiange County, Sichuan, including a Jiang Wei Well (ÂßúÁ∂≠‰∫ï), Jiang Wei Cave (ÂßúÁ∂≠Ê¥û), Jiang Wei Fortress (ÂßúÁ∂≠Âüé), Jiang Wei Temple (ÂßúÁ∂≠Âªü), Lord Jiang Bridge (ÂßúÂÖ¨Ê©ã), Jiang Wei Armoury (ÂßúÁ∂≠ËªçÊ¢∞) and Jiang Wei Tomb (ÂßúÁ∂≠Â¢ì). Poets such as Lu You, Zuo Mu (Â∑¶Áâß), Li Tiaoyuan (ÊùéË™øÂÖÉ) and Zhuang Xuehe (ËéäÂ≠∏Âíå) have written poems at Jianmen Pass to praise Jiang Wei.

He allied himself with Yuan Shu in 190 when warlords from eastern China formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who held the puppet Emperor Xian in his power. Although he controlled neither many troops nor much land, Sun Jian's personal bravery and resourcefulness were feared by Dong Zhuo, who placed him among Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Liu Biao as the most influential men at that time. After the coalition disbanded in the next year, China fell into massive civil war. In 191, Sun Jian was killed in battle during an offensive campaign against Liu Biao. Sun Jian was also the father of Sun Quan, one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms era who eventually established the Eastern Wu state and declared himself its first emperor in 229, whereupon Sun Jian was given the posthumous title \\"Emperor Wulie\\" (). Early life and career Sun Jian was born in Fuchun County (), Wu Commandery, around present day Fuyang, Zhejiang. He was allegedly a descendant of Sun Tzu, the author of The Art of War. No more immediate records survive, indicating his family probably played a very small part during the Han dynasty. Even his father's name is unrecorded, although a folk tradition gives it as Sun Zhong (). Sun Jian was a civil official in his home county during his youth. When he was 16, Sun Jian travelled with his father to Qiantang, where they encountered a band of pirates dividing up their spoils on land. Sun Jian jumped on shore with a sabre in hand and pointed in different directions as if commanding a detachment of soldiers to surround the pirates. Seeing this, the pirates were deceived and fled. Sun Jian pursued, and only after taking the head of every pirate did he return (or just the leaders according to some accounts). His name henceforth spread. In 172, he became acting major for the pro-government militias which fought against Xu Chang's rebellion in Kuaiji Commandery. He raised a militia of about 1,000 men and served with distinction, whereupon he was recommended to the court by Yang Province Inspector Zhang Min. Sun Jian was consequently rewarded with a post as assistant magistrate in Guangling Commandery, and later in two counties in Xiapi. This allowed him to gather many followers. In 184, the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao broke out across the country. Sun Jian joined the general Zhu Jun to quell the rebellion in Yu Province (covering roughly present-day southern Henan and northern Anhui). The soldiers fought hard, forcing the rebels to retreat to Wan (ÂÆõ; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan). Sun Jian placed himself in the forefront and climbed onto the city walls alone. The rest then swarmed in and defeated the rebels. Around this time, Bian Zhang and Han Sui colluded with the Qiang tribes and rebelled in Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û; present-day western Gansu). After Dong Zhuo failed to put down the rebellion, the central government sent in his place the Minister of Works Zhang Wen, who invited Sun Jian along as an adviser. When Zhang Wen summoned Dong Zhuo to the encampment at Chang'an, Dong Zhuo procrastinated and took a long time to arrive. When he did, he showed little respect for Zhang Wen. Sun Jian then advised Zhang Wen to execute Dong Zhuo, but Zhang Wen declined as Dong Zhuo held high reputation in the west. Despite scoring a major victory against the rebels at Meiyang, Zhang Wen could not press their advantage and the rebellion was still not quelled. Zhang Wen and the rest returned to the capital Luoyang in disgrace and thus no honor was accorded. Meanwhile, another local-scale rebellion broke out near Changsha Commandery and the rebels besieged the city. Sun Jian was then appointed as the Administrator of Changsha Commandery. Within a month upon taking up office, Sun Jian had quelled the rebellion. Meanwhile, rebellions also broke out in the neighbouring commanderies of Lingling (Èõ∂Èôµ; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (Ê°ÇÈôΩ; around present-day Guiyang County, Hunan). Sun Jian defeated the rebel leaders Ou Xing (), Zhou Chao () and Guo Shi (), and suppressed both rebellions. The Han imperial court enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Wucheng () in recognition of his contributions. Coalition against Dong Zhuo In 189, Emperor Ling died, leaving his young son in the care of Empress Dowager He and General-in-Chief He Jin. He Jin then summoned Dong Zhuo to lead troops into the capital to assist in a plot to eliminate the powerful eunuch faction. Before Dong Zhuo arrived, however, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuchs and Luoyang fell into chaos following a clash between supporters of both sides. Dong Zhuo then seized military control of the capital and deposed the young emperor for the puppet Emperor Xian. However, his tyrannical ways incurred the wrath of many and in the following year, warlords from eastern China formed a coalition against him. Sun Jian also raised an army and joined Yuan Shu, one of the leaders of the coalition at Luyang (È≠ØÈôΩ; present-day Lushan County, Henan). On his way, he killed Inspector of Jing Province Wang Rui and Administrator of Nanyang Zhang Zi. Yuan Shu appointed Sun Jian as General Who Destroys Barbarians (Á†¥ËôúÂ∞áËªç, also translated as \\"General Who Smashes the Caitiffs\\") and Inspector of Yu Province (). Sun Jian then began training and preparing his troops at Luyang. A force sent by Dong Zhuo was so impressed with the strict discipline of Sun Jian's troops that they gave up the plan to attack Luyang. When Sun Jian moved out to Liangdong (Ê¢ÅÊù±; east of present-day Linru County, Henan), he was outnumbered by Dong Zhuo's forces. With several dozen horsemen, Sun Jian broke out of the encirclement. He took off the red felt scarf he had always been wearing and handed it to his trusted aide Zu Mao (), whom Dong Zhuo's soldiers then chased after while Sun Jian escaped. Unable to shake off his pursuers, Zu Mao then dismounted, hung the scarf onto a half-burnt pillar, and hid himself in the tall grass nearby. The enemies surrounded the pillar and approached cautiously till they realised they had been fooled, whereupon they retreated. After regrouping his troops, Sun Jian pressed his troops towards Luoyang and engaged in battle against Dong Zhuo's forces at Yangren (ÈôΩ‰∫∫; believed to be near present-day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan). He scored a brilliant victory and killed the enemy commander Hua Xiong in battle (191).de Crespigny (2006), 333. At this time, someone told Yuan Shu that if Sun Jian defeated Dong Zhuo and took over Luoyang, he would no longer submit to anyone. Feeling doubtful, Yuan Shu stopped providing food supplies to Sun Jian's army. Sun Jian rode the hundred odd li from Yangren to Luyang overnight to see Yuan Shu, whereupon he told the latter, \\"I put myself in danger during battle, firstly to eliminate the villain (Dong Zhuo) for the Han Empire, and secondly to avenge the deaths of your family members. I have no personal grudge against Dong Zhuo. Yet you believe slanderous talks and suspect me!\\" The words put Yuan Shu to shame and he immediately ordered his men to continue delivering food supplies to Sun Jian's army. Fearing Sun Jian, Dong Zhuo then sent his general Li Jue as an emissary to seek peace and propose a marriage to cement the alliance. However, Sun Jian rejected the proposals with harsh words and continued to lead his troops towards Luoyang. In late 190, his army was merely 90 li away from the capital when Dong Zhuo retreated west to Chang'an after ordering the destruction of Luoyang by fire. Entering the ruins of Luoyang, Sun Jian ordered his men to reseal the tombs of Han emperors that were excavated by Dong Zhuo, after which he returned to Luyang. It was said in the Book of Wu () by Wei Zhao that Sun Jian found one of the emperor's jade seals in a well south of Luoyang and kept it. Later, when Yuan Shu declared himself emperor, he held Sun Jian's wife Lady Wu hostage in exchange for the seal. Later life In 191, Yuan Shu sent Sun Jian to attack Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province (ËçÜÂ∑û; covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). He defeated Liu Biao's forces led by Huang Zu and pursued the enemy across the Han River to Xiangyang. While he was travelling alone through Xianshan (), Huang Zu's troops ambushed him and shot him to death with arrows. The Record of Heroes () by Wang Can, however, claims that Sun Jian died in 193 and that he was crushed to death by boulders while pursuing the enemy commander L√º Gong (). Sun Jian's nephew, Sun Ben, gathered his uncle's troops and returned to Yuan Shu, who then appointed him as the Inspector of Yu Province to replace his uncle. Sun Jian was buried in the Gao Mausoleum in Qu'e (Êõ≤Èòø; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). He was survived by at least five sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Sun Ce, became a warlord and conquered several territories in the Jiangdong region. Like his father, Sun Ce died at a relatively young age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan. Sun Quan built on his brother's legacy and eventually established the state of Eastern Wu in 229, with himself as its founding emperor, during the Three Kingdoms period. After ascending the throne, Sun Quan honoured his father with the posthumous title \\"Emperor Wulie\\" ().

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, some events of Sun Jian were romanticised by Luo Guanzhong. Sun Jian first appears the novel in Chapter 5, in which he joined the coalition against Dong Zhuo. In the battle against Hua Xiong, the commander of the enemy army, Sun Jian took off his own red scarf and handed it to Zu Mao () when Sun Jian's army was raided. Having distracted Hua Xiong and let Sun Jian escape, Zu Mao was chased after by Hua Xiong, so he hid himself in woods after hanging the scarf on a half-burnt pillar. When Hua Xiong found himself to be fooled, he killed Zu Mao who dashed out of his hideout to challenge him. Hua Xiong then launched an attack on Sun's army, which lasted for a whole night. Sun Jian could not resist Hua Xiong, so he called for assistance from the coalition. Hua Xiong was unrivalled until he met the unfamed Guan Yu. After Dong Zhuo retreated to Chang'an, Sun Jian was the first to enter Luoyang and ordered to put off the fires set by Dong Zhuo. Seeing the destruction of the imperial capital and Han dynasty, Sun Jian sighed and shed a tear. However, when his men found a jade seal, which was proven to be the imperial seal, Sun Jian grew ambitious and requested to retreat to his base. The news was leaked, to Sun Jian's miscalculation. When Yuan Shao, the leader of the coalition, interrogated Sun Jian, the latter swore by saying, \\"Should I have hid the treasure, I shall die miserably under arrows!\\" Under the protection by his guards, Sun Jian left Luoyang immediately. On the way to his base, Sun Jian passed through Jing Province, where the governor, Liu Biao, was asked by Yuan Shao to attack Sun Jian. Sun Jian badly lost the battle and barely escaped. When he later launched a revenge attack upon Jing Provence, in accordance with the order of his senior, Yuan Shu, he was lured under a cliff where he was shot dead by arrows from the above. Sun's camp reclaimed Sun Jian's corpse using a captive, Huang Zu, who was Liu Biao's brother-in-law. When Dong Zhuo heard of Sun's death in Chang'an, he said, \\"One of my greatest enemies is removed!\\" and consequently usurped more power in the imperial court. A Qing dynasty illustration of Sun Jian and Yuan Shao fighting over the seal. In popular culture Sun Jian is featured as a playable character in Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi video game series. He also appears in Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. He is a playable warlord in the 2019 game Total War: Three Kingdoms by Creative Assembly. In the SD Gundam series BB Senshi Sangokuden, which is based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Sun Jian is characterised as the Gundam Sonken Zephyranthes. His design invokes a white tiger motif.

Later, with encouragement from Sun Quan, L√º Meng took up scholarly pursuits to improve himself, gradually becoming a learned and competent military leader. In 217, he succeeded Lu Su as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces in Jing Province. Two years later, in a carefully calculated military operation, L√º Meng led an invasion of Liu Bei's territories in southern Jing Province, swiftly and stealthily capturing all the lands from Liu Bei's general Guan Yu, who was captured and executed after his defeat. L√º Meng enjoyed his finest hour after the victory but died a few months later because he was already seriously ill before the campaign. Early life L√º Meng was from Fupo County (), Runan Commandery (), which is located southeast of present-day Funan County, Anhui. His family migrated to the south of the Yangtze River when L√º Meng was young. L√º Meng lived with his brother-in-law, Deng Dang (), who served as a military officer under Sun Ce. When he was 14 or 15, he secretly followed Deng Dang to the battles against the Shanyue tribes. Deng Dang was shocked to see his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded L√º Meng and warned him to stop. L√º Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told L√º Meng's mother about this. When she wanted to punish him, L√º Meng said: \\"It is difficult to survive in poverty. If we can prove ourselves through hard work, then wealth will come eventually. How can we catch the tiger cub if we don't enter the tiger's den?\\" L√º Meng's mother sighed and let him have his way.(ÂëÇËíôÂ≠óÂ≠êÊòéÔºåÊ±ùÂçóÂØåÈôÇ‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ ...

At the time, an official scorned L√º Meng because of his young age and often insulted him by saying things like: \\"What can he do? His behaviour will only result in him feeding himself to the tigers.\\" L√º Meng killed the official one day when he lost control of his anger. Initially, he took shelter under Zheng Chang () but later turned himself in to Yuan Xiong (), a colonel under Sun Ce. Yuan Xiong pleaded with his lord to spare L√º Meng's life. Sun Ce interviewed L√º Meng and was so impressed with him that he pardoned L√º Meng and appointed him as a close aide.(ÊôÇÁï∂ËÅ∑Âêè‰ª•ËíôÂπ¥Â∞èËºï‰πãÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂΩºË±éÂ≠ê‰ΩïËÉΩÁÇ∫ÔºüÊ≠§Ê¨≤‰ª•ËÇâÈ§ßËôéËÄ≥„ÄÇ„Äç‰ªñÊó•ËàáËíôÊúÉÔºåÂèàËö©Ëæ±‰πã„ÄÇËíôÂ§ßÊÄíÔºåÂºïÂàÄÊÆ∫ÂêèÔºåÂá∫Ëµ∞ÔºåÈÄÉÈÇëÂ≠êÈÑ≠Èï∑ÂÆ∂„ÄÇÂá∫Âõ†Ê†°Â∞âË¢ÅÈõÑËá™È¶ñÔºåÊâøÈñìÁÇ∫Ë®ÄÔºåÁ≠ñÂè¨Ë¶ãÂ•á‰πãÔºåÂºïÁΩÆÂ∑¶Âè≥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. A few years later, after Deng Dang died, Zhang Zhao recommended L√º Meng to replace Deng Dang, so L√º Meng was appointed as a Major of a Separate Command (). In the year 200, after Sun Ce was assassinated, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him as the warlord ruling the territories in the Jiangdong region. Sun Quan planned to reorganise his army by merging small units into larger garrisons. When L√º Meng heard about it, he collected funds to purchase elaborately designed armour for his troops. When Sun Quan came to inspect L√º Meng's unit, he was so impressed that he placed more soldiers under L√º Meng's command, thus saving L√º Meng's troops from being merged into another unit.(Êï∏Ê≠≤ÔºåÈÑßÁï∂Ê≠ªÔºåÂºµÊò≠Ëñ¶Ëíô‰ª£Áï∂ÔºåÊãúÂà•ÈÉ®Âè∏È¶¨„ÄÇÊ¨äÁµ±‰∫ãÔºåÊñôË´∏Â∞èÂ∞áÂÖµÂ∞ëËÄåÁî®ËñÑËÄÖÔºåÊ¨≤Âπ∂Âêà‰πã„ÄÇËíôÈô∞Ë≥íË≤∞ÔºåÁÇ∫ÂÖµ‰ΩúÁµ≥Ë°£Ë°åÁ∏¢ÔºåÂèäÁ∞°Êó•ÔºåÈô≥ÂàóËµ´ÁÑ∂ÔºåÂÖµ‰∫∫Á∑¥ÁøíÔºåÊ¨äË¶ã‰πãÂ§ßÊÅ±ÔºåÂ¢ûÂÖ∂ÂÖµ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

Battle of Jiangxia In the spring of 208, L√º Meng was assigned to be the navy commandant when Sun Quan launched a campaign against Huang Zu, the Administrator () of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day eastern Hubei). During the battle, Ling Tong and Dong Xi destroyed Huang Zu's two large mengchongs while L√º Meng's unit defeated Huang Zu's navy. L√º Meng killed Huang Zu's subordinate Chen Jiu () in the midst of battle. Huang Zu attempted to flee after learning of Chen Jiu's death, but was captured by Sun Quan's soldiers. After the battle, Sun Quan deemed L√º Meng's contributions to be the most significant because Chen Jiu's death secured their victory. L√º Meng was promoted to General of the Household Who Sweeps Across the Wilderness () and awarded 10 million coins.(ÂæûÂæÅÈªÉÁ•ñÔºåÁ•ñ‰ª§ÈÉΩÁù£Èô≥Â∞±ÈÄÜ‰ª•Ê∞¥ËªçÂá∫Êà∞„ÄÇËíôÂãíÂâçÈãíÔºåË¶™Ê¢üÂ∞±È¶ñÔºåÂ∞áÂ£´‰πòÂãùÔºåÈÄ≤ÊîªÂÖ∂Âüé„ÄÇÁ•ñËÅûÂ∞±Ê≠ªÔºåÂßîÂüéËµ∞ÔºåÂÖµËøΩÁ¶Ω‰πã„ÄÇÊ¨äÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∫ã‰πãÂÖãÔºåÁî±Èô≥Â∞±ÂÖàÁç≤‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç‰ª•ËíôÁÇ∫Ê©´Èáé‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞áÔºåË≥úÈå¢ÂçÉËê¨„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Red Cliffs campaign In the winter of 208, L√º Meng participated in the Battle of Red Cliffs, in which the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei defeated the forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao at Wulin (ÁÉèÊûó; in present-day Honghu, Hubei). Cao Cao perfunctorily retreated to northern China, leaving behind his general Cao Ren to defend Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei). Sun Quan's forces, led by Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, pressed on their attack and besieged Cao Ren in Nan Commandery.(ÊòØÊ≠≤ÔºåÂèàËàáÂë®Áëú„ÄÅÁ®ãÊôÆÁ≠âË•øÁ†¥ÊõπÂÖ¨ÊñºÁÉèÊûóÔºåÂúçÊõπ‰ªÅÊñºÂçóÈÉ°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Around the time, Xi Su (), a military officer from Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), brought along his men to defect to Sun Quan's side. Zhou Yu proposed to Sun Quan to let L√º Meng take charge of Xi Su's troops. However, L√º Meng praised Xi Su as a courageous person and declined to take over command of Xi Su's men. He believed it was disrespectful to do so because Xi Su had come a long way to join them. Sun Quan agreed with L√º Meng and returned Xi Su's troops to him.(ÁõäÂ∑ûÂ∞áË•≤ËÇÖËàâËªç‰æÜÈôÑÔºåÁëúË°®‰ª•ËÇÖÂÖµÁõäËíôÔºåËíôÁõõÁ®±ËÇÖÊúâËÜΩÁî®Ôºå‰∏îÊÖïÂåñÈÅ†‰æÜÔºåÊñºÁæ©ÂÆúÁõä‰∏çÂÆúÂ•™‰πü„ÄÇÊ¨äÂñÑÂÖ∂Ë®ÄÔºåÈÇÑËÇÖÂÖµ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. During the siege of Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to lead a detachment to take control of Yiling (Â§∑Èôµ; present-day Yichang, Hubei), but Gan Ning came under attack by a separate enemy force led by Cao Ren's subordinates. When Gan Ning sent a messenger to Zhou Yu's camp to request for relief forces, most of Sun Quan's officers saw that they did not have enough men to spare, so they refused to help Gan Ning. L√º Meng, however, insisted on saving Gan Ning. He told Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu: \\"I suggest we leave Ling Tong behind while I follow you to help Gan Ning. It is imperative that we lift the siege (on Gan Ning) because he may not be able to hold out for long. I assure you that Ling Tong can defend our current position for at least ten days.\\" L√º Meng also suggested to Zhou Yu to send 300 men to block the enemy's retreat route with huge logs. When the reinforcements arrived at Yiling, they killed over half of the total number of enemy troops and forced the surviving ones to retreat at night. However, the enemy encountered the huge logs and were unable to cross over on horseback, so they had to dismount and proceed on foot. Sun Quan's pursuing forces arrived at the blockade and seized about 300 horses left behind by the enemy, which they transported back to their camp on boats. The morale of Zhou Yu's army improved greatly, so they crossed the Yangtze River, set up a garrison near the enemy base, and then engaged Cao Ren's forces in battle. Cao Ren lost the battle and eventually ordered his troops to abandon their position and retreat. Sun Quan's forces captured Nan Commandery and gained control over central Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). Upon his return, L√º Meng was promoted to Lieutenant-General () and appointed as the Prefect () of Xunyang County (Â∞ãÈôΩÁ∏£; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei).(Áëú‰ΩøÁîòÂØßÂâçÊìöÂ§∑ÈôµÔºåÊõπ‰ªÅÂàÜË°ÜÊîªÂØßÔºåÂØßÂõ∞ÊÄ•Ôºå‰Ωø‰ΩøË´ãÊïë„ÄÇË´∏Â∞á‰ª•ÂÖµÂ∞ë‰∏çË∂≥ÂàÜÔºåËíôË¨ÇÁëú„ÄÅÊôÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁïôÊ∑©ÂÖ¨Á∏æÔºåËíôËàáÂêõË°åÔºåËß£ÂúçÈáãÊÄ•ÔºåÂã¢‰∫¶‰∏ç‰πÜÔºåËíô‰øùÂÖ¨Á∏æËÉΩÂçÅÊó•ÂÆà‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂèàË™™ÁëúÂàÜÈÅ£‰∏âÁôæ‰∫∫Êü¥Êñ∑Èö™ÈÅìÔºåË≥äËµ∞ÂèØÂæóÂÖ∂È¶¨„ÄÇÁëúÂæû‰πã„ÄÇËªçÂà∞Â§∑ÈôµÔºåÂç≥Êó•‰∫§Êà∞ÔºåÊâÄÊÆ∫ÈÅéÂçä„ÄÇÊïµÂ§úÈÅÅÂéªÔºåË°åÈÅáÊü¥ÈÅìÔºåÈ®éÁöÜËàçÈ¶¨Ê≠•Ëµ∞„ÄÇÂÖµËøΩËπôÊìäÔºåÁç≤È¶¨‰∏âÁôæÂåπÔºåÊñπËàπËºâÈÇÑ„ÄÇÊñºÊòØÂ∞áÂ£´ÂΩ¢Âã¢Ëá™ÂÄçÔºå‰πÉÊ∏°Ê±üÁ´ãÂ±ØÔºåËàáÁõ∏ÊîªÊìäÔºåÊõπ‰ªÅÈÄÄËµ∞ÔºåÈÅÇÊìöÂçóÈÉ°ÔºåÊí´ÂÆöËçäÂ∑û„ÄÇÈÇÑÔºåÊãúÂÅèÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈ†òÂ∞ãÈôΩ‰ª§„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

Lu Su had all along regarded L√º Meng with contempt, but someone told him: \\"General L√º's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon.\\" Lu Su then headed to L√º Meng's camp. After some drinks, L√º Meng asked Lu Su, \\"You have received an important appointment and you are going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?\\" Lu Su lackadaisically replied, \\"I will adapt to the situation when the time comes.\\" L√º Meng then said: \\"The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?\\" L√º Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su on how to deal with Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to L√º Meng, placed his hand on his shoulder and said, \\"L√º Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here.\\" He also visited L√º Meng's mother and became friends with L√º Meng.(È≠ØËÇÖ‰ª£Âë®ÁëúÔºåÁï∂‰πãÈô∏Âè£ÔºåÈÅéËíôÂ±Ø‰∏ã„ÄÇËÇÖÊÑèÂ∞öËºïËíôÔºåÊàñË™™ËÇÖÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂëÇÂ∞áËªçÂäüÂêçÊó•È°ØÔºå‰∏çÂèØ‰ª•ÊïÖÊÑèÂæÖ‰πüÔºåÂêõÂÆúÈ°ß‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇÂæÄË©£Ëíô„ÄÇÈÖíÈÖ£ÔºåËíôÂïèËÇÖÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêõÂèóÈáç‰ªªÔºåËàáÈóúÁæΩÁÇ∫ÈÑ∞ÔºåÂ∞á‰ΩïË®àÁï•Ôºå‰ª•ÂÇô‰∏çËôûÔºü„ÄçËÇÖÈÄ†Ê¨°ÊáâÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËá®ÊôÇÊñΩÂÆú„ÄÇ„ÄçËíôÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ªäÊù±Ë•øÈõñÁÇ∫‰∏ÄÂÆ∂ÔºåËÄåÈóúÁæΩÂØ¶ÁÜäËôé‰πüÔºåË®àÂÆâÂèØ‰∏çË±´ÂÆöÔºü„ÄçÂõ†ÁÇ∫ËÇÖÁï´‰∫îÁ≠ñ„ÄÇËÇÖÊñºÊòØË∂äÂ∏≠Â∞±‰πãÔºåÊãäÂÖ∂ËÉåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂëÇÂ≠êÊòéÔºåÂêæ‰∏çÁü•ÂçøÊâçÁï•ÊâÄÂèä‰πÉËá≥ÊñºÊ≠§‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇÊãúËíôÊØçÔºåÁµêÂèãËÄåÂà•„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. =Jiang Biao Zhuan account= The Jiang Biao Zhuan recorded a slightly different account of the meeting between Lu Su and L√º Meng.

The Chinese idioms \\"Ah Meng from Wu\\" () and \\"rub one's eyes and look\\" () originated from this conversation. The former is used to describe an unlearned person who achieves improvement through diligent study while the latter means to see a person in a different light, especially after the person has made remarkable improvement. Battles of Wan County and Ruxu Cao Cao appointed Xie Qi () as the Agricultural Officer () of Qichun County and ordered him to station at Wan County (ÁöñÁ∏£; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui) to harass the border of Sun Quan's domain. L√º Meng tried to induce Xie Qi into surrendering but failed, so he attacked Xie Qi. Xie Qi lost the battle and retreated.

In 213, L√º Meng followed Sun Quan to Ruxu (Êø°È†à; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui) to guard against Cao Cao's advances. Sun Quan wanted to construct a dock at Ruxu, but his subordinates said, \\"We should land on the other side of the river and attack the enemy, then return to our ships. Why build a dock?\\" However, L√º Meng supported the idea of building a dock and he said: \\"Battles are unpredictable and we might not always win. If we lose and the enemy closes in, and we don't have time to retreat to the riverbank, how can we even board our ships?\\" Sun Quan agreed with L√º Meng and had the dock constructed to make boardings and landings more convenient. With this, Sun Quan's army defended their positions against Cao Cao's approaching forces, who retreated after several failed attempts to overcome the enemy.(ÂæåÂæûÊ¨äÊãíÊõπÂÖ¨ÊñºÊø°È†àÔºåÊï∏ÈÄ≤Â•áË®àÔºåÂèàÂã∏Ê¨äÂ§æÊ∞¥Âè£Á´ãÂ°¢ÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•ÂÇôÂæ°ÁîöÁ≤æÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨‰∏çËÉΩ‰∏ãËÄåÈÄÄ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.(Âê≥ÈåÑÊõ∞ÔºöÊ¨äÊ¨≤‰ΩúÂ°¢ÔºåË´∏Â∞áÁöÜÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏äÂ≤∏ÊìäË≥äÔºåÊ¥óË∂≥ÂÖ•ËàπÔºå‰ΩïÁî®Â°¢ÁÇ∫Ôºü„ÄçÂëÇËíôÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖµÊúâÂà©ÈàçÔºåÊà∞ÁÑ°ÁôæÂãùÔºåÂ¶ÇÊúâÈÇÇÈÄÖÔºåÊïµÊ≠•È®éËπô‰∫∫Ôºå‰∏çÊöáÂèäÊ∞¥ÔºåÂÖ∂ÂæóÂÖ•Ëàπ‰πéÔºü„ÄçÊ¨äÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂñÑ„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇ‰Ωú‰πã„ÄÇ) Wu Lu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. Battle of Lujiang Around 214, Cao Cao retreated from Ruxu, he appointed Zhu Guang () as the Administrator () of Lujiang Commandery (Âª¨Ê±üÈÉ°; around present-day Lujiang County, Anhui) and ordered him to station at Wan County (ÁöñÁ∏£; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). Zhu Guang developed the area for agricultural use, while bribing bandits from Poyang County to cause trouble in Sun Quan's territories. L√º Meng warned Sun Quan: \\"The lands in Wan County are very fertile so the enemy's numbers will rise after they gain a bountiful harvest. Within a few years time, Cao Cao's military prowess would have increased significantly, so we should eliminate them soon.\\" Sun Quan heeded L√º Meng's advice and personally led a campaign to attack Lujiang Commandery.

The officers suggested to pile up earth to form small hills and replenish their equipment. However, L√º Meng disagreed: \\"It will take several days to build the hills and replenish our equipment.

L√º Meng recommended Gan Ning to lead the assault on Wan County while he followed behind with the elite troops. When they attacked at dawn, L√º Meng himself beat a war drum to boost the soldiers' morale. They captured the fortress by noon. Around the same time, Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao was leading reinforcements from Hefei to help Zhu Guang. When he reached Jiashi (), he heard that Wan County had fallen to the enemy so he withdrew his troops. Sun Quan praised L√º Meng for his bravery and appointed him as the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery. L√º Meng gained 600 households from Xunyang County (Â∞ãÈôΩÁ∏£; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei) for his tuntian system and had 30 more subordinates placed under his command.(Ëíô‰πÉËñ¶ÁîòÂØßÁÇ∫ÂçáÂüéÁù£ÔºåÁù£ÊîªÂú®ÂâçÔºåËíô‰ª•Á≤æÈä≥Áπº‰πã„ÄÇ‰æµÊô®ÈÄ≤ÊîªÔºåËíôÊâãÂü∑ÊûπÈºìÔºåÂ£´ÂçíÁöÜÈ®∞Ë∏äËá™ÂçáÔºåÈ£üÊôÇÁ†¥‰πã„ÄÇÊó£ËÄåÂºµÈÅºËá≥Â§æÁü≥ÔºåËÅûÂüéÂ∑≤ÊãîÔºå‰πÉÈÄÄ„ÄÇÊ¨äÂòâÂÖ∂ÂäüÔºåÂç≥ÊãúÂª¨Ê±üÂ§™ÂÆàÔºåÊâÄÂæó‰∫∫È¶¨ÁöÜÂàÜËàá‰πãÔºåÂà•Ë≥úÂ∞ãÈôΩÂ±ØÁî∞ÂÖ≠ÁôæÊà∂ÔºåÂÆòÂ±¨‰∏âÂçÅ‰∫∫„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

L√º Meng achieved success and killed the bandit chiefs but released the others and allowed them to revert to normal civilian life.(ËíôÈÇÑÂ∞ãÈôΩÔºåÊú™ÊúüËÄåÂª¨ÈôµË≥äËµ∑ÔºåË´∏Â∞áË®éÊìä‰∏çËÉΩÁ¶ΩÔºåÊ¨äÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈ∑ôÈ≥•Á¥ØÁôæÔºå‰∏çÂ¶Ç‰∏ÄÈ∂ö„ÄÇ„ÄçÂæ©‰ª§ËíôË®é‰πã„ÄÇËíôËá≥ÔºåË™ÖÂÖ∂È¶ñÊÉ°ÔºåÈ§òÁöÜÈáãÊîæÔºåÂæ©ÁÇ∫Âπ≥Ê∞ë„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Sun‚ÄìLiu territorial dispute Around 212, Sun Quan's ally Liu Bei embarked on a campaign to seize control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. He left Guan Yu behind to defend his territories in southern Jing Province during his absence. After Liu Bei completely took over Yi Province in 214, Sun Quan perceived that he was \\"lending\\" territories in Jing Province to Liu Bei per an earlier agreement in 210 so he wanted the territories back because Liu Bei already had a new base in Yi Province. When Liu Bei refused, Sun Quan ordered L√º Meng to lead troops to seize three commanderies ‚Äì Changsha (), Lingling (Èõ∂Èôµ; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (Ê°ÇÈôΩ; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan).(ÊòØÊôÇÂäâÂÇô‰ª§ÈóúÁæΩÈéÆÂÆàÔºåÂ∞àÊúâËçäÂúüÔºåÊ¨äÂëΩËíôË•øÂèñÈï∑Ê≤ô„ÄÅÈõ∂„ÄÅÊ°Ç‰∏âÈÉ°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. L√º Meng wrote to the administrators of the three commanderies to ask them to submit to Sun Quan. They all agreed except Lingling's administrator, Hao Pu (). Liu Bei returned to Jing Province when he heard of L√º Meng's advances and garrisoned troops at Gong'an County while ordering Guan Yu to lead an army to take back the three commanderies. At the time, Sun Quan was at Lukou (Èô∏Âè£; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) and he sent Lu Su to lead 10,000 troops to Yiyang to block Guan Yu. Sun Quan also sent an urgent order to L√º Meng, ordering him to give up on Lingling and lead his troops to Yiyang to assist Lu Su.(ËíôÁßªÊõ∏‰∫åÈÉ°ÔºåÊúõÈ¢®Ê≠∏ÊúçÔºåÊÉüÈõ∂ÈôµÂ§™ÂÆàÈÉùÊôÆÂüéÂÆà‰∏çÈôç„ÄÇËÄåÂÇôËá™ËúÄË¶™Ëá≥ÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåÈÅ£ÁæΩÁà≠‰∏âÈÉ°„ÄÇÊ¨äÊôÇ‰ΩèÈô∏Âè£Ôºå‰ΩøÈ≠ØËÇÖÂ∞áËê¨‰∫∫Â±ØÁõäÈôΩÊãíÁæΩÔºåËÄåÈ£õÊõ∏Âè¨ËíôÔºå‰ΩøÊç®Èõ∂ÈôµÔºåÊÄ•ÈÇÑÂä©ËÇÖ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. When L√º Meng pacified Changsha, he passed by Ling County (ÈÖÉÁ∏£; east of present-day Hengyang, Hunan) and met Deng Xuanzhi (), an old friend of Hao Pu. He planned to use Deng Xuanzhi to trick Hao Pu into surrendering. That night, L√º Meng summoned all his officers and gave them instructions on how to attack Lingling the following morning, without telling them that Sun Quan had given orders for them to give up on Lingling and move to Yiyang. He lied to Deng Xuanzhi that Liu Bei was besieged in Hanzhong by Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan and that Guan Yu was occupied in a battle at Nan Commandery. He then asked Deng Xuanzhi to help him persuade Hao Pu to give up on Lingling. Deng Xuanzhi went to see Hao Pu later and conveyed L√º Meng's message. Hao Pu became afraid when he heard that he had been isolated, so he agreed to surrender and asked Deng Xuanzhi to lead him to L√º Meng. When L√º Meng met Hao Pu, he revealed the truth, clapped his hands and laughed. Hao Pu became wrecked with guilt when he learnt that both Liu Bei and Guan Yu were actually free to reinforce Lingling but it was too late. L√º Meng left Sun He () behind to guard the three commanderies while he headed towards Yiyang per Sun Quan's order.(ÂàùÔºåËíôÊó£ÂÆöÈï∑Ê≤ôÔºåÁï∂‰πãÈõ∂ÈôµÔºåÈÅéÈÖÉÔºåËºâÂçóÈôΩÈÑßÁéÑ‰πãÔºåÁéÑ‰πãËÄÖÈÉùÊôÆ‰πãËàä‰πüÔºåÊ¨≤‰ª§Ë™òÊôÆ„ÄÇÂèäË¢´Êõ∏Áï∂ÈÇÑÔºåËíôÁ•ï‰πãÔºåÂ§úÂè¨Ë´∏Â∞áÔºåÊéà‰ª•ÊñπÁï•ÔºåÊô®Áï∂ÊîªÂüéÔºåÈ°ßË¨ÇÁéÑ‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈÉùÂ≠êÂ§™ËÅû‰∏ñÈñìÊúâÂø†Áæ©‰∫ãÔºå‰∫¶Ê¨≤ÁÇ∫‰πãÔºåËÄå‰∏çÁü•ÊôÇ‰πü„ÄÇÂ∑¶Â∞áËªçÂú®Êº¢‰∏≠ÔºåÁÇ∫Â§è‰æØÊ∑µÊâÄÂúç„ÄÇÈóúÁæΩÂú®ÂçóÈÉ°Ôºå‰ªäËá≥Â∞äË∫´Ëá™Ëá®‰πã„ÄÇËøëËÄÖÁ†¥Ê®äÊú¨Â±ØÔºåÊïëÈÖÉÔºåÈÄÜÁÇ∫Â≠´Ë¶èÊâÄÁ†¥„ÄÇÊ≠§ÁöÜÁõÆÂâç‰πã‰∫ãÔºåÂêõÊâÄË¶™Ë¶ã‰πü„ÄÇÂΩºÊñπÈ¶ñÂ∞æÂÄíÁ∏£ÔºåÊïëÊ≠ª‰∏çÁµ¶ÔºåË±àÊúâÈ§òÂäõÂæ©ÁáüÊ≠§ÂìâÔºü‰ªäÂêæÂ£´ÂçíÁ≤æÈä≥Ôºå‰∫∫ÊÄùËá¥ÂëΩÔºåËá≥Â∞äÈÅ£ÂÖµÔºåÁõ∏ÁπºÊñºÈÅì„ÄÇ‰ªä‰∫à‰ª•Êó¶Â§ï‰πãÂëΩÔºåÂæÖ‰∏çÂèØÊúõ‰πãÊïëÔºåÁå∂ÁâõËπÑ‰∏≠È≠öÔºåÂÖæË≥¥Ê±üÊº¢ÔºåÂÖ∂‰∏çÂèØÊÅÉ‰∫¶ÊòéÁü£„ÄÇËã•Â≠êÂ§™ÂøÖËÉΩ‰∏ÄÂ£´Âçí‰πãÂøÉÔºå‰øùÂ≠§Âüé‰πãÂÆàÔºåÂ∞öËÉΩÁ®ΩÂª∂Êó¶Â§ïÔºå‰ª•ÂæÖÊâÄÊ≠∏ËÄÖÔºåÂèØ‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂêæË®àÂäõÂ∫¶ÊÖÆÔºåËÄå‰ª•ÊîªÊ≠§ÔºåÊõæ‰∏çÁßªÊó•ÔºåËÄåÂüéÂøÖÁ†¥ÔºåÂüéÁ†¥‰πãÂæåÔºåË∫´Ê≠ª‰ΩïÁõäÊñº‰∫ãÔºåËÄå‰ª§ÁôæÊ≠≤ËÄÅÊØçÊà¥ÁôΩÂèóË™ÖÔºåË±à‰∏çÁóõÂìâÔºüÂ∫¶Ê≠§ÂÆ∂‰∏çÂæóÂ§ñÂïèÔºåË¨ÇÊè¥ÂèØÊÅÉÔºåÊïÖËá≥ÊñºÊ≠§ËÄ≥„ÄÇÂêõÂèØË¶ã‰πãÔºåÁÇ∫Èô≥Á¶çÁ¶è„ÄÇ„ÄçÁéÑ‰πãË¶ãÊôÆÔºåÂÖ∑ÂÆ£ËíôÊÑèÔºåÊôÆÊáºËÄåËÅΩ‰πã„ÄÇÁéÑ‰πãÂÖàÂá∫Â†±ËíôÔºåÊôÆÂ∞ãÂæåÁï∂Ëá≥„ÄÇËíôË±´ÂãëÂõõÂ∞áÔºåÂêÑÈÅ∏Áôæ‰∫∫ÔºåÊôÆÂá∫Ôºå‰æøÂÖ•ÂÆàÂüéÈñÄ„ÄÇÈ†àËáæÊôÆÂá∫ÔºåËíôËøéÂü∑ÂÖ∂ÊâãÔºåËàá‰ø±‰∏ãËàπ„ÄÇË™ûÁï¢ÔºåÂá∫Êõ∏Á§∫‰πãÔºåÂõ†ÊãäÊâãÂ§ßÁ¨ëÔºåÊôÆË¶ãÊõ∏ÔºåÁü•ÂÇôÂú®ÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåËÄåÁæΩÂú®ÁõäÈôΩÔºåÊÖôÊÅ®ÂÖ•Âú∞„ÄÇËíôÁïôÂ≠´Ê≤≥Âßî‰ª•Âæå‰∫ã„ÄÇÂç≥Êó•ÂºïËªçËµ¥ÁõäÈôΩ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

By 215, Sun Quan's forces had failed to breach Hefei's walls and had also sustained heavy casualties in the earlier engagements with the enemy. When a plague broke out in his army, Sun Quan decided to withdraw. While retreating, Sun Quan was caught up in a fierce counterattack by Zhang Liao, but managed to break out of the encirclement and reach safety when his officers, including L√º Meng, fought with their lives to protect their lord at all costs.(Â∏´ÈÇÑÔºåÈÅÇÂæÅÂêàËÇ•ÔºåÊó£ÂæπÂÖµÔºåÁÇ∫ÂºµÈÅºÁ≠âÊâÄË•≤ÔºåËíôËàáÊ∑©Áµ±‰ª•Ê≠ªÊâûË°û„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

Sun Quan led his forces to resist the enemy and placed L√º Meng in charge of the army. L√º Meng arrived at the dock, which was constructed earlier in 213, and stationed thousands of archers there to rain arrows on the enemy when they approached. He also attacked the camp of Cao Cao's vanguard force before the enemy established a foothold and succeeding in destroying the camp. Cao Cao saw that he could not overcome Sun Quan and eventually retreated. L√º Meng was promoted to General of Tiger's Might () and appointed as Left Protector of the Army ().(ÂæåÊõπÂÖ¨ÂèàÂ§ßÂá∫Êø°È†àÔºåÊ¨ä‰ª•ËíôÁÇ∫Áù£ÔºåÊìöÂâçÊâÄÁ´ãÂ°¢ÔºåÁΩÆÂΩäÂº©Ëê¨ÂºµÊñºÂÖ∂‰∏äÔºå‰ª•ÊãíÊõπÂÖ¨„ÄÇÊõπÂÖ¨ÂâçÈãíÂ±ØÊú™Â∞±ÔºåËíôÊîªÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨ÂºïÈÄÄ„ÄÇÊãúËíôÂ∑¶Ë≠∑Ëªç„ÄÅËôéÂ®ÅÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

L√º Meng was also appointed as the Administrator () of Hanchang Commandery (Êº¢ÊòåÈÉ°; southeast of present-day Pingjiang County, Hunan) and received Xiajun (), Liuyang (), Hanchang and Zhouling () counties as his personal marquisate. He was stationed near the Sun-Liu border, which was guarded by Liu Bei's general Guan Yu on the other side. L√º Meng was aware of Guan Yu's military prowess and his intention of seizing Sun Quan's territories in Jing Province. He also knew that Guan Yu was in a strategic position on the upstream of the Yangtze River.

He left behind his subordinates Shi Ren and Mi Fang to defend Gong'an County and Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) respectively.

Guan Yu fell for the ruse and withdrew the backup forces and advanced towards Fancheng. When Cao Cao heard of the attack at Fancheng, he sent Yu Jin to lead an army to relief Cao Ren, but Yu Jin lost the battle and surrendered to Guan Yu. Guan Yu's troops increased in numbers after his victory so he lacked food supplies. He sent his men to seize grain from one of Sun Quan's depots along the Xiang River. When Sun Quan heard about it, he sent L√º Meng ahead to invade Jing Province while he followed up behind. L√º Meng arrived at Xunyang County (Â∞ãÈôΩÁ∏£; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei), where he ordered his elite soldiers to disguise themselves as merchants and sail towards Nan Commandery. On the journey, they captured the watchtowers set up by Guan Yu along the river to prevent the defenders from learning of their approach.

This incident shocked the other soldiers in L√º Meng's unit and they did not dare to defy his orders. L√º Meng won the hearts of the people by showing kindness towards them ‚Äì he provided necessities such as food and clothing to the elderly and the poor, and distributed medicine to the sick.

Guan Yu's troops lost their fighting spirit after hearing that L√º Meng treated their families better than how Guan Yu treated them in the past. Guan Yu knew that he had lost and was isolated, so he withdrew to Maicheng (È∫•Âüé; around present-day Maicheng Village, Lianghe Town, Dangyang, Hubei). When they reached Zhang District () in the west, Guan Yu's men deserted and surrendered to Sun Quan's forces. Sun Quan sent Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang to block Guan Yu's retreat route.

Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had L√º Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure L√º Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as L√º Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see L√º Meng but felt that it was too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe L√º Meng's room. He was happy when he saw L√º Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that L√º Meng did not eat anything. When L√º Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit L√º Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase L√º Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, L√º Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by L√º Meng's death. Before L√º Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their prized possessions ‚Äì including gifts from Sun Quan ‚Äì in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that L√º Meng had made such arrangements before his death.(ËíôÂõ∫Ëæ≠ÈáëÈå¢ÔºåÊ¨ä‰∏çË®±„ÄÇÂ∞ÅÁàµÊú™‰∏ãÔºåÊúÉËíôÁñæÁôºÔºåÊ¨äÊôÇÂú®ÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåËøéÁΩÆÂÖßÊÆøÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•Ê≤ªË≠∑ËÄÖËê¨ÊñπÔºåÂãüÂ∞ÅÂÖßÊúâËÉΩÊÑàËíôÁñæËÄÖÔºåË≥úÂçÉÈáë„ÄÇÊôÇÊúâÈçºÂä†ÔºåÊ¨äÁÇ∫‰πãÊÖòÊÖºÔºåÊ¨≤Êï∏Ë¶ãÂÖ∂È°èËâ≤ÔºåÂèàÊÅêÂãûÂãïÔºåÂ∏∏Á©øÂ£ÅÁûª‰πãÔºåË¶ãÂ∞èËÉΩ‰∏ãÈ£üÂâáÂñúÔºåÈ°ßÂ∑¶Âè≥Ë®ÄÁ¨ëÔºå‰∏çÁÑ∂ÂâáÂíÑÂî∂ÔºåÂ§ú‰∏çËÉΩÂØê„ÄÇÁóÖ‰∏≠Áò≥ÔºåÁÇ∫‰∏ãËµ¶‰ª§ÔºåÁæ£Ëá£Áï¢Ë≥Ä„ÄÇÂæåÊõ¥Â¢ûÁØ§ÔºåÊ¨äËá™Ëá®Ë¶ñÔºåÂëΩÈÅìÂ£´ÊñºÊòüËæ∞‰∏ãÁÇ∫‰πãË´ãÂëΩ„ÄÇÂπ¥ÂõõÂçÅ‰∫åÔºåÈÅÇÂçíÊñºÂÖßÊÆø„ÄÇÊôÇÊ¨äÂìÄÁóõÁîöÔºåÁÇ∫‰πãÈôçÊêç„ÄÇËíôÊú™Ê≠ªÊôÇÔºåÊâÄÂæóÈáëÂØ∂Ë´∏Ë≥úÁõ°‰ªòÂ∫úËóèÔºåÂãë‰∏ªËÄÖÂëΩÁµï‰πãÊó•ÁöÜ‰∏äÈÇÑÔºåÂñ™‰∫ãÂãôÁ¥Ñ„ÄÇÊ¨äËÅû‰πãÔºåÁõä‰ª•ÊÇ≤ÊÑü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

Anecdotes =Incident with Cai Yi= In his younger days, L√º Meng was not competent in reading and writing. Whenever he issued orders, he had to verbally instruct his subordinates or ask someone to help him write. Cai Yi (), the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery, scorned him because of that. However, L√º Meng never hated Cai Yi for treating him with contempt. When Gu Shao (), the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, died, L√º Meng recommended Cai Yi to Sun Quan to replace Gu Shao. Sun Quan laughed and asked L√º Meng, \\"Are you trying to be like Qi Xi?\\" He heeded L√º Meng's suggestion.(ËíôÂ∞ë‰∏çËÑ©Êõ∏ÂÇ≥ÔºåÊØèÈô≥Â§ß‰∫ãÔºåÂ∏∏Âè£Âç†ÁÇ∫ÁâãÁñè„ÄÇÂ∏∏‰ª•ÈÉ®Êõ≤‰∫ãÁÇ∫Ê±üÂ§èÂ§™ÂÆàËî°ÈÅ∫ÊâÄÁôΩÔºåËíôÁÑ°ÊÅ®ÊÑè„ÄÇÂèäË±´Á´†Â§™ÂÆàÈ°ßÈÇµÂçíÔºåÊ¨äÂïèÊâÄÁî®ÔºåËíôÂõ†Ëñ¶ÈÅ∫Â•âËÅ∑‰Ω≥ÂêèÔºåÊ¨äÁ¨ëÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêõÊ¨≤ÁÇ∫Á•ÅÂ•öËÄ∂Ôºü„ÄçÊñºÊòØÁî®‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. =Tolerating Gan Ning= L√º Meng was unhappy with Gan Ning, a general under Sun Quan, because of his violent and murderous ways. There was one incident where L√º Meng was so furious with Gan Ning that he wanted to kill him. Gan Ning also infuriated Sun Quan on a number of occasions when he defied his lord's orders. When L√º Meng heard about it, he told Sun Quan: \\"The Empire has yet to be pacified. Fierce generals like Gan Ning are hard to come by. You should tolerate him.\\" Sun Quan heeded L√º Meng's advice and treated Gan Ning generously.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms L√º Meng appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. His death is dramatised in chapter 77 of the novel. Sun Quan and his subjects are celebrating their conquest of Jing Province, with L√º Meng receiving the highest honour. During the banquet, Guan Yu's spirit suddenly possesses L√º Meng, grabs Sun Quan and shouts, \\"Green-eyed brat! Purple-bearded coward, do you still recognise me?\\" Sun Quan's subordinates immediately rush forth to save their lord. The possessed L√º Meng shoves Sun Quan away and sits on his seat. With a furious expression on his face, he booms, \\"Since defeating the Yellow Turban rebels, I have fought in wars for over 30 years. But I lost my life because you used an evil scheme against me. I can't feast on your flesh when I was still alive, but I can still seize L√º Meng's soul after death! I am Guan Yunchang, the Marquis of Hanshou Village.\\" Sun Quan and the others are so terrified that they sink to their knees. L√º Meng collapses and dies, bleeding from seven body orifices. Everyone is traumatised by the scene they witnessed.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 77. In popular culture L√º Meng is featured as a playable character in Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi video game series. In the games, his name is spelled as \\"Lu Meng\\" without the diaeresis in the \\"U\\" in \\"Lu\\". He also appears in all instalments of Koei's strategy game series Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The fictional character Ryomou Shimei of the anime and manga series Ikki Tousen is based on L√º Meng.

He covered five Major League Baseball teams, beginning with 25 years of calling the games of the St. Louis Cardinals with two of these years also spent calling games for the St. Louis Browns. After a year working for the Oakland Athletics and eleven years with the Chicago White Sox, Caray spent the last sixteen years of his career as the announcer for the Chicago Cubs. Early life Caray was born Harry Christopher Carabina to an Italian father and Romanian mother in St. Louis. He was 14 when his mother, Daisy Argint, died from complications due to pneumonia. Caray did not have much recollection of his father, who went off to fight in the First World War. Caray went to live with his uncle John Argint and Aunt Doxie at 1909 LaSalle Avenue. Caray attended high school at Webster Groves High School. In this youth, Caray was said to be a talented baseball player. He possessed the tools to play at the next level; out of high school, the University of Alabama offered Caray a spot on the team. Due to financial woes, Caray could not accept. Around this time, World War II was occurring, so Caray tried to enlist into the Armed Forces, but got denied due to poor eyesight. With not being able to advance his physical side of baseball, and selling gym equipment was not enough,[Jamail, M. (April 27, 2018). Harry Caray. Retrieved June 16, 2018, from https://www.britannica.com/biography/Harry-Caray] he wanted to find another avenue to keep his love of baseball alive; through his voice. He then spent a few years learning the trade at radio stations in Joliet, Illinois, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. While in Joliet, WCLS station manager Bob Holt suggested that Harry change his surname from Carabina (because according to Holt, it sounded too awkward on the air) to Caray. Career =St. Louis Cardinals/St. Louis Browns= Caray in 1951, when he was with the St. Louis Cardinals Caray caught his break when he landed the job with the Cardinals in 1945 and, according to several histories of the franchise, proved as expert at selling the sponsor's beer as he'd been in selling the Cardinals on KMOX. Immediately preceding the Cardinal job, Caray announced hockey games for the St. Louis Flyers. Caray co-announced with Ralph Bouncer Taylor, former NHL player. On one occasion Taylor temporarily ended his retirement when he volunteered to play goalie for the Flyers in a regular season game with the team from Minnesota. (Caray and broadcast partner Gabby Street also called games for the St. Louis Browns in 1945‚Äì1946.) Caray was also seen as influential enough that he could affect team personnel moves; Cardinals historian Peter Golenbock (in The Spirit of St. Louis: A History of the St. Louis Cardinals and Browns) has suggested Caray may have had a partial hand in the maneuvering that led to the exit of general manager Bing Devine, the man who had assembled the team that won the 1964 World Series, and of field manager Johnny Keane, whose rumored successor, Leo Durocher (the succession didn't pan out), was believed to have been supported by Caray for the job. Caray, however, stated in his autobiography that he liked Johnny Keane as a manager, and did not want to be involved in Keane's dismissal.Holy Cow! Harry Caray with Bob Verdi, 1989, Villard Books As the Cardinals' announcer, Caray broadcast three World Series (1964, 1967, and 1968) on NBC. In November 1968, Caray was nearly killed after being struck by an automobile while crossing a street in St. Louis; he suffered two broken legs in the accident, but recuperated in time to return to the broadcast booth for the start of the 1969 season. Cardinals' president Gussie Busch, then CEO of owner Anheuser-Busch, spent lavishly to ensure Caray recovered, flying him on the company's planes to a company facility in Florida to rehabilitate and recuperate. On Opening Day, fans cheered when he dramatically threw aside the two canes he had been using to cross the field and continued to the broadcast booth under his own power.Knoedelseder, 111 Following the 1969 season, the Cardinals declined to renew Caray's contract after he had called their games for 25 years, his longest tenure with any sports team. The team stated that the action had been taken on the recommendation of Anheuser‚ÄìBusch's marketing department, but did not give specifics. At a news conference afterward, where he drank conspicuously from a can of Schlitz, at that time a major competitor to Anheuser‚ÄìBusch, Caray dismissed that claim, saying no one was better at selling beer than he had been. Instead, he suggested, he had been the victim of rumors that he had had an affair with Gussie Busch's daughter-in- law.Knoedelseder, 112. \\"I gotta believe the real reason was that someone believed the rumor I was involved with young Busch's wife.\\" =Oakland Athletics= He spent one season broadcasting for the Athletics, in 1970, before, as he often told interviewers, he grew tired of owner Charles O. Finley's interference and accepted a job with the Chicago White Sox. (Apparently the feeling was mutual; Finley later said that \\"that shit [Caray] pulled in St. Louis didn't go over here.\\") Finley wanted Caray to change his broadcast chant of \\"Holy Cow\\" to \\"Holy Mule.\\"Charlie Finley: The Outrageous Story of Baseball's Super Showman, p. 141, G. Michael Green and Roger D. Launius. Walker Publishing Company, New York, 2010, However, there were some reports that Caray and Finley did, in fact, work well with each other and that Caray's strained relationship with the A's came from longtime A's announcer Monte Moore; Caray was loose and free-wheeling while Moore was more restrained and sedate. =Chicago White Sox= Caray joined the Chicago White Sox in 1971 and quickly became popular with the South Side faithful and enjoying a reputation for joviality and public carousing (sometimes doing home game broadcasts shirtless from the bleachers). He wasn't always popular with players, however; Caray had an equivalent reputation of being critical of home team blunders. During his tenure with the White Sox, Caray was teamed with many color analysts who didn't work out well, including Bob Waller, Bill Mercer and ex-Major League catcher J. C. Martin, among others. But in 1976, during a game against the Texas Rangers, Caray had former outfielder Jimmy Piersall (who was working for the Rangers at the time) as a guest in the White Sox booth that night. The tandem proved to work so well that Piersall was hired to be Caray's partner in the White Sox radio and TV booth beginning in 1977. Piersall and Caray became very popular. Among Caray's experiences during his time with the White Sox was the infamous \\"Disco Demolition Night\\" promotion. On July 12, 1979, what began as a promotional effort by Chicago radio station WLUP, the station's popular DJ Steve Dahl, and the Sox to sell seats at a White Sox/Detroit Tigers double-header resulted in a debacle. As Dahl blew up a crate full of disco records on the field after the first game had ended, thousands of rowdy fans from the sold-out event poured from the stands onto the field at Comiskey Park. Caray and Piersall, via the public address system, tried to calm the crowd and implored them to return to their seats, in vain. Eventually the field was cleared by Chicago Police in riot gear and the White Sox were forced to forfeit the second game of the double- header due to the extensive damage done to the playing field. Caray left the White Sox after the 1981 season, replaced by Don Drysdale. However, the popular Caray was soon hired by the crosstown Cubs for the 1982 season. =Chicago Cubs= U.S. President Ronald Reagan in the press box with Caray during a 1988 game at Wrigley Field Caray increased his renown after joining the North Side Cubs following the 1981 season. In contrast to the \\"SportsVision\\" concept, the Cubs' own television outlet, WGN-TV, had become among the first of the cable television superstations, offering their programming to providers across the United States for free, and Caray became as famous nationwide as he had long been on the South Side and, previously, in St. Louis. In fact, Caray had already been affiliated with WGN for some years by then, as WGN actually produced the White Sox games for broadcast on competitor WSNS-TV, and Caray was a frequent sportscaster on the station's newscasts. Caray succeeded longtime Cubs broadcaster Jack Brickhouse, a beloved announcer and Chicago media fixture. The timing worked in Caray's favor, as the Cubs ended up winning the National League East division title in 1984 with WGN-TV's nationwide audience following along. Millions came to love the microphone-swinging Caray, continuing his White Sox practice of leading the home crowd in singing \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" during the seventh inning stretch, mimicking his mannerisms, his gravelly voice, his habit of mispronouncing or slurring some players' names ‚Äî which some of the players mimicked in turn ‚Äî and even his trademark barrel-shaped wide-rimmed glasses, prescribed for him by Dr. Cyril Nierman, O.D. In February 1987 Caray suffered a stroke while at his winter home near Palm Springs, California, just prior to spring training for the Cubs' 1987 season. This led to his absence from the broadcast booth through most of the first two months of the regular season, with WGN featuring a series of celebrity guest announcers on game telecasts while Caray recuperated. Caray's national popularity never flagged after that, although time eventually took a toll on him. Nicknamed \\"The Mayor of Rush Street\\", a reference to Chicago's famous tavern-dominated neighborhood and Caray's well-known taste for Budweiser, illness and age began to drain some of Caray's skills, even in spite of his remarkable recovery from the 1987 stroke. There were occasional calls for him to retire, but he was kept aboard past WGN's normal mandatory retirement age, an indication of how popular he was. Toward the end of his career, Caray's schedule was limited to home games and road trips to St. Louis and Atlanta. In December 1997, Caray's grandson Chip Caray was hired to share play-by-play duties for WGN's Cubs broadcasts with Caray for the following season. However, Harry Caray died in February 1998, before the baseball season began, leaving the expected grandfather-grandson partnership in the broadcast booth unrealized. =The seventh-inning stretch= Caray using his net to catch a foul ball in the Cardinals broadcast booth, 1957. He continued this practice when he worked for other teams. Caray is credited with popularizing the singing of \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\" during the seventh-inning stretch. Throughout his broadcasting career, Caray would sing the song in his booth. There would only be a few people who could hear Caray sing: his broadcast partners, WMAQ Radio producer Jay Scott, and the select fans whose seats were near the booth. Scott suggested that Caray's singing be put on the stadium public address system, in the early 1970s, but Caray and station management rejected the idea. When owner Bill Veeck took over the White Sox in 1976, he would observe Caray and some fans singing the song and wanted to incorporate Caray into a stadium-wide event. It was a few games into the 1976 season when Veeck secretly placed a public-address microphone into Caray's booth and turned it on once Nancy Faust, the Comiskey Park organist, began playing \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\", so that everyone in the park could hear Caray singing. Veeck asked Caray if he would sing regularly, but the announcer initially wanted no part of it. Veeck advised Caray that he had already taped the announcer singing during commercial breaks and said he could play that recording if Caray preferred. When Caray questioned the idea, Veeck explained, \\"Anybody in the ballpark hearing you sing ‚ÄòTake Me Out to the Ball Game‚Äô knows that he can sing as well as you can. Probably better than you can. So he or she sings along. Hell, if you had a good singing voice, you'd intimidate them, and nobody would join in.\\" Harry Caray's statue outside Wrigley Field Caray finally agreed to sing it live, accompanied by Faust on the organ, and went on to become famous for singing the tune, continuing to do so at Wrigley Field after becoming the broadcaster of the Chicago Cubs, using a hand-held microphone and holding it out outside the booth window. Many of these performances began with Caray speaking directly to the baseball fans in attendance either about the state of the day's game, or the Chicago weather, while the park organ held the opening chord of the song. Then with his trademark opening, \\"All right! Lemme hear ya! Ah-One! Ah-Two! Ah-Three!\\" Harry would launch into his distinctive, down-tempo version of \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\". During his tenure announcing games at Comiskey Park and later Wrigley Field, he would often replace \\"root, root, root for the home team\\" with \\"root, root, root for the White Sox/Cubbies\\". For the lyrics \\"One, Two, Three, strikes you're out ...\\" Harry would usually hold the microphone out to the crowd to punctuate the climactic end of the song. And if the visitors were ahead in that game, Harry would typically make a plea to the home team's offense: \\"Let's get some runs!\\" Once Caray died in 1998, the Cubs would bring in guest conductors of the song, this tradition is still alive to this day. His wife and grandson, Chip Caray, were the first people to guest conduct the song following his death.[Gomez, L. (January 4, 2018). How a man and a song turned the seventh inning into hallowed Wrigley tradition. Retrieved from http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/celebrity/chi- wrigley-field-7th-inning-stretch-harry-caray-20140401-column.html] During the 2009 NHL Winter Classic at Wrigley Field, as the Chicago Blackhawks hosted the Detroit Red Wings on New Year's Day 2009, former Blackhawks players Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, and Denis Savard and former Cubs players Ryne Sandberg and Ferguson Jenkins sang a hockey-themed version of the seventh-inning stretch; \\"Take Me Out to the Hockey Game\\" used lines such as \\"Root, root, root for the Blackhawks\\" and \\"One, two, three pucks, you're out.\\" The Blackhawks would do this again in 2010 during the White Sox ‚Äì Cubs game at Wrigley Field. This time, it was members of the Stanley Cup winning team. =Personality and style= Caray began his broadcasting career in St. Louis, where he was the third person at a local radio station. This meant that he was responsible for the commercials and quick breaks between the play-by-play announcers. His style of delivering the news was different than anybody else in St. Louis; he was critical, he told the truth and held nothing back. This style was typically only used in the newspaper business, so when Caray brought this style to the radio, his ratings and popularity rose exponentially. This led to him beginning to announce Cardinals games with Gabby Street. Caray had a number of broadcasting partners and colleagues through the years. He had a frosty relationship with Milo Hamilton, his first partner with the Cubs, who felt Caray had pushed him out in St. Louis in the mid-1950s. Hamilton (who'd been the presumptive successor to Jack Brickhouse prior to Caray's hiring) was fired by WGN in 1984; he claimed that station officials told him that the main reason was that Caray did not like him. However, Caray also did not lack for broadcast companions who enjoyed his work and companionship. With the White Sox, his longest-serving partner was Jimmy Piersall; with the Cubs, he was teamed for 14 years with former pitcher Steve Stone. Caray was known for his absolute support of the team for which he announced. While advertisers played up his habit of openly rooting for the Cubs from the booth (for example, a 1980s Budweiser ad described him as \\"Cub Fan, Bud Man\\" in a Blues Brothers- style parody of \\"Soul Man\\"), he had been even less restrained about rooting for the Cardinals when he broadcast for them. He said later that his firing from the Cardinals changed his outlook and made him realize that his passion was for the game itself, and the fans, more than anything else. He was also famous for his frequently exclaimed catchphrase \\"Holy Cow!\\" when his team hit a home run or turned a difficult play on field; he trained himself to use this expression to avoid any chance of accidentally using profanity on the air. Caray also avoided any risk of mis-calling a home run, using what became a trademark home run call: \\"It might be ... it could be ... it IS! A home run! Holy cow!\\" He first used the \\"It might be ...\\" part of that expression on the air while covering a college baseball tournament in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the early 1940s. Caray was one of the first announcers to step out of the booth while broadcasting a game. Often with his tenure with both the Cubs and White Sox, he would set up in the outfield and broadcast the game from a table amongst the fans. Caray said, \\"I am the eyes and ears of the fan. If I do not tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, the fan doesn‚Äôt want to know.\\"Hughes, P., & Miles, B. (2008). Harry Caray: Voice of the fans. Naperville, IL: Sourcebooks MediaFusion. During his tenure with the White Sox Caray would often announce the game in the outfield bleachers, surrounded by beer cups and fans. One of his favorite things to do was to find a member of the opposing team and try to say their name backwards. When Caray had a stroke in 1987, this did not occur as often as before. A video of Caray trying to say Mark Grudzielanek's name backwards can be found here: [C. (October 9, 2012). Retrieved June 16, 2018, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNn-_FU-kiw] Caray had a reputation for mastering all aspects of broadcasting: writing his own copy, conducting news interviews, writing and presenting editorials, covering other sports such as University of Missouri football, and hosting a sports talk program. =Non-baseball work= Though best known and honored for baseball work, Caray also called football (Missouri Tigers football), ice hockey (St. Louis Flyers), basketball (St. Louis Billikens, Boston Celtics and St. Louis Hawks) in the 1940s, 50s and '60s. Additionally, he broadcast eight Cotton Bowl Classic games (1958‚Äì64, 1966) on network radio. Personal life Caray was the uncle of actor Tim Dunigan known for playing many roles on both the screen and stage. His son Skip Caray followed him into the booth as a baseball broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves. Caray's broadcasting legacy was extended to a third-generation, as his grandson Chip Caray replaced Harry as the Cubs' play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2004. Chip currently serves as the Braves television announcer on Fox Sports South. On October 23, 1987, Harry Caray's Italian Steakhouse opened in the Chicago Varnish Company Building, a Chicago Landmark building that is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There are seven restaurants and an off-premises catering division which bear the Harry Caray name. Controversy Caray has made comments that have been considered racist against Asians and Asian- Americans.Ikezoe-Halevi, Jean (September 21, 1995). \\"Caray Controversy.\\" Chicago Tribune.

She told police she was returning from a visit to \\"a friend\\"; the cause of the accident was never disclosed publicly and no further action was taken. However, her marriage to the younger Busch was failing due to his extreme commitment to the family business.Knoeldeseder, 106‚Äì107 According to Anheuser‚ÄìBusch historian William Knoedelseder, the two had been seen eating together at Tony's, a popular and well-regarded St. Louis restaurant (where Knoedelseder later worked, and heard the story from more senior staff). Waitstaff present said the two were both extremely inebriated and openly affectionate. They stood out not only because both were well-recognized around St. Louis but because Caray was 22 years older than she. The restaurant's owner had to tell the staff not to stare at the couple. It also was rumored that the near-fatal car accident Caray suffered later that year was actually intentional and related to the alleged affair. Private investigators working for Busch had found that telephone records showed Caray and Susan Busch had made many calls to each other. They supposedly confronted him about the reported affair while he was in Florida recuperating. Susan divorced her husband shortly afterwards. She has only spoken about the alleged affair once since then, denying it. While she and the broadcaster were friends, \\"we were not a romance item by any means\\", she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Caray cited the rumors of the affair as the real reason the Cardinals declined to renew his contract after the disappointing 1969 season. Like Susan Busch, Caray, too, denied that the affair had occurred when asked, but according to Knoedelseder was less consistent, sometimes suggesting it had indeed occurred, and usually saying how flattered he was at the idea that a woman as attractive as Susan Busch would see him the same way. Death Harry Caray died on February 18, 1998 as a result of complications from a heart attack and brain damage. On Valentine's Day, Caray and his wife, \\"Dutchie\\" Goldman, were at a Rancho Mirage, California, restaurant celebrating the holiday when Caray collapsed during the meal. Steve Stone's 1999 publication Where‚Äôs Harry? suggests that Caray's head made contact with the table, resulting in a loss of consciousness. This has never been confirmed, but is one possibility. Caray was rushed to nearby Eisenhower Medical Center, where he never woke up from his coma and died on February 18, 1998. He was 83. Harry Caray banner at Wrigley Field Caray's funeral was held on February 27, 1998 at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago. The Chicago community came out to pay respect to the Hall of Fame announcer, including Chicago Cubs players Sammy Sosa, Mark Grace, manager Jim Riggleman, and ex-players Ryne Sandberg, Rick Sutcliffe, and Billy Williams. Illinois Governor Jim Edgar, Mayor Richard Daley, and Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka were also in attendance.[It Was Harry's Kind Of Funeral. (February 28, 1998). Retrieved from http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-02-28/sports/9802280033_1_chip-caray- harry-caray-funeral-mass] The organist of Holy Name Cathedral, Sal Soria, did not have any sheet music to play the song Caray made famous in the broadcast booth, \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\", which resulted in him borrowing the music. He said in a Chicago Tribune article, \\"I had to sort of somber it up and slow it down to make it a little more classy. Actually, it was kind of fun to do it\\". Harry Caray is buried at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois.[Harry Caray (1914 - 1998). (n.d.). Retrieved from https://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/c/caray/] =Legacy= Following his death, during the entire 1998 season the Cubs wore a patch on the sleeves of their uniforms depicting a caricature of Caray. Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa dedicated each of his 66 home runs that season to Caray. Caray had five children, three with his first wife, Dorothy, and two with his second wife, Marian. He married his third wife Delores \\"Dutchie\\" (Goldmann) on May 19, 1975. His son Skip Caray followed him into the booth as a baseball broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves until his death on August 3, 2008. Caray's broadcasting legacy was extended to a third generation, as his grandson Chip Caray replaced Harry as the Cubs' play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2004. Chip later returned to work with his father Skip on Atlanta Braves broadcasts, where he had worked for a while in the early 1990s. In what Harry Caray said was one of his proudest moments, he worked some innings in the same broadcast booth with his son and grandson, during a Cubs/Braves game on May 13, 1991. On-air in a professional setting, the younger men would refer to their seniors by their first names. During 1998, Chip would refer to the departed Harry in third person as \\"Granddad\\". When the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in seven games to win the 2016 World Series, Budweiser produced a celebratory commercial entitled \\"Harry Caray's Last Call\\" featuring Caray's call of the game using archived footage.Harry Caray's Last Call - Chicago Cubs 2016 World Series Champions Budweiser on YouTube Honors and special events The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Caray as Missouri Sportscaster of the Year twice (1959, 1960) and Illinois Sportscaster of the Year 10 times (1971‚Äì73, 75‚Äì78, 83‚Äì85), and inducted him into its NSSA Hall of Fame in 1988. In 1989, the Baseball Hall of Fame presented Caray with the Ford C. Frick Award for \\"major contributions to baseball.\\" That same year, he was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1990, and has his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. On June 24, 1994, the Chicago Cubs had a special day honoring Harry for 50 years of broadcasting Major League Baseball. Sponsored by the Cubs and Kemper Insurance, pins were given out to some unknown number of fans in attendance that day. The pins had a picture of Harry, with writing saying \\"HARRY CARAY, 50 YEARS BROADCASTING, Kemper MUTUAL FUNDS\\" and \\"HOLY COW.\\" In 1994, Caray was the radio inductee into the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Caray's style became fodder for pop culture parody as well, including a memorable Saturday Night Live recurring sketch featuring Caray (played by Will Ferrell) in various Weekend Update segments opposite Norm Macdonald and Colin Quinn. Caray would frequently abandon the topic he was supposed to be talking about and would drift into hypothetical topics like whether or not they would eat the moon if it were made of spare ribs and turning hot dogs into currency (20 hot dogs would equal roughly a nickel, depending on the strength of the yen). The sketch continued after Caray's death. When asked by Norm Macdonald about his death, Will Ferrell as Caray replied, \\"What's your point?\\" The Bob and Tom Show also had a Harry Caray parody show called \\"After Hours Sports\\", which eventually became \\"Afterlife Sports\\" after Caray's death, and the Heaven and Hell Baseball Game, in which Caray is the broadcast announcer for the games. On the Nickelodeon series Back at the Barnyard, news reporter Hilly Burford bears a strong resemblance to Caray, both in appearance and speech. In 2005, the cartoon Codename: Kids Next Door had two announcers reporting a baseball game. One was a parody of Caray, the other, Howard Cosell. The recurring character Reverend Fantastic from the animated television series Bordertown bears an uncanny likeness to Caray in both appearance and speaking style. Another Caray impersonation was done by Chicago radio personality Jim Volkman, heard most often on the Loop and AM1000. Also, comedian Artie Lange, in his standup, talks about Caray. Caray can be briefly heard in the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as a Cubs game is shown on a TV in a pizza parlor. In 2008, a series of Chicago-area TV and radio ads for AT&T;'s Advanced TV featured comedian John Caponera impersonating the post-stroke version of Harry Caray. However, AT&T; soon withdrew the spots following widespread criticism and a complaint by Caray's widow. Jeff Lawrence is known for his Harry Caray impression, most notably, he announced the Cubs' starting lineup while speaking like the post-stroke version of Caray before a nationally televised baseball game on Fox Sports. Jeff led the stadium in singing 'Take Me Out To The Ballgame' in July 2016, dressed as Caray, including oversized glasses and wig. Atlanta Braves pitcher Will Ohman performed a Harry Caray impersonation when announcing the starting lineup for the Atlanta Braves during a Fox Game of the Week in 2008. In 1988, Vess Beverage Inc. released and sold a Harry Caray signature soda, under the brand \\"Holy Cow\\", complete with his picture on every can.

The University of Saskatchewan (U of S) is a Canadian public research university, founded on March 19, 1907, and located on the east side of the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. An \\"Act to establish and incorporate a University for the Province of Saskatchewan\\" was passed by the provincial legislature in 1907. It established the provincial university on March 19, 1907 \\"for the purpose of providing facilities for higher education in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage\\". The University of Saskatchewan is the largest education institution in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The University of Saskatchewan is one of Canada‚Äôs top research universities (based on the number of Canada Research Chairs) and is a member of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities (the 15 most research- intensive universities in Canada). The university began as an agricultural college in 1907 and established the first Canadian university-based department of extension in 1910. There were set aside for university buildings and for the U of S farm, and agricultural fields. In total was annexed for the university. The main University campus is situated upon , with another allocated for Innovation Place Research Park. The University of Saskatchewan agriculture college still has access to neighbouring urban research lands. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) facility, (2003) develops DNA-enhanced immunization vaccines for both humans and animals. The University is also home to the Canadian Light Source synchrotron, which is considered one of the largest and most innovative investments in Canadian science. Since its origins as an agricultural college, research has played an important role at the university. Discoveries made at the U of S include sulphate-resistant cement and the cobalt-60 cancer therapy unit. The university offers over 200 academic programs. Duncan P. McColl was appointed as the first registrar, establishing the first convocation from which Chief Justice Edward L. Wetmore was elected as the first chancellor. Walter Charles Murray became the first president of the university's board of governors. History =Beginnings= The eastern fa√ßade of the Academic Health Sciences Building prior to the construction of the D Wing The institution was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, was granted a provincial charter on March 19, 1907. A provincial statute known as the University Act. It provided for a publicly funded, yet independent institution to be created for the citizens of the whole province. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The scope of the new institution was to include colleges of arts and science, including art, music and commerce, agriculture with forestry, domestic science, education, engineering, law, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary science and dentistry. Saskatoon was chosen as the site for the University on April 7, 1909 by the board of governors. On October 12, 1912 the first building opened its doors for student admission. It awarded its first degrees in 1912. In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. Battleford, Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, Regina, and Saskatoon all lobbied to be the location of the new university. Walter Murray preferred the provincial capital, Regina. In a politically influenced vote, Saskatoon was chosen on April 7, 1909. Plaque commemorating World War I veterans: \\"1914‚Äì1918 In Memory of All Ranks of the 46th Battalion C.E.F. They are too near to be great, but our children shall understand when and how our fate was changed, and by whose hand.\\" Designed by David Robertson Brown (architect), the Memorial Gates were erected in 1927 at the corner of College Drive and Hospital Drive in honour of the University of Saskatchewan alumni who served in the First World War. A stone wall bears inscriptions of the names of the sixty seven university students and faculty who lost their lives while on service during World War I. The hallways of the Old Administrative Building (College Building) at the University of Saskatchewan are decorated with memorial scrolls in honour of the University of Saskatchewan alumni who served in the World Wars. The National Film Board of Canada documentary \\"Prairie University\\" (1955) directed by John Feeney explores diverse research activities at the University of Saskatchewan on agriculture, medicine, and ice cream. A college of veterinary medicine opened at the University of Saskatchewan on July 2, 1969. The University of Saskatchewan's Arms were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 15, 2001. =Campus= Nobel Plaza, University of Saskatchewan A location next to the South Saskatchewan River, across from the city centre of Saskatoon, was selected for the campus. David Robertson Brown of Brown & Vallance were the initial architects constructing a campus plan and the first university buildings in Collegiate Gothic style: The Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, laid the cornerstone of the first building, the College Building, on July 29, 1910. The first building to be started on the new campus, the College Building, built 1910‚Äì1912 opened in 1913; in 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada. Brown & Vallance designed the Administration Building (1910‚Äì12); Saskatchewan Hall Student Residence (1910‚Äì12). Brown & Vallance designed the Engineering Building (1910‚Äì12) as well as additions 1913 in 1920 and rebuilt the building after it burned in 1925. Brown & Vallance designed the Barn and Stock Pavilion (1910‚Äì12) and Emmanuel College (1910‚Äì12). Brown & Vallance built the Faculty Club (1911‚Äì12) and rebuilt it after it burned in 1964. Brown & Vallance constructed the President's Residence (1911‚Äì13) Qu'Appelle Hall Student Residence (1914‚Äì16) Physics Building (1919‚Äì21); Chemistry Building (1922‚Äì23); St. Andrew's Presbyterian College (1922‚Äì23); Memorial Gates (1927‚Äì28) and the Field Husbandry Building (1929). The original buildings were built using native limestone ‚Äì greystone ‚Äì which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, this greystone became one of the most recognizable campus signatures. When the local supply of limestone was exhausted, the University turned to Tyndall stone, which is quarried in Manitoba. Saskatchewan's Provincial University and Agricultural College were officially opened May 1, 1913 by Hon. Walter Scott. The Bowl, a green space on the University of Saskatchewan main campus, as seen today The original architectural plan called for the university buildings to be constructed around a green space known as The Bowl. The original university buildings are now connected by skywalks and tunnels. Clockwise, from the north; Thorvaldson Building (August 22, 1924) (Spinks addition); Geology, W.P. Thompson Biology (1960) adjoined to Physics Building (1921); College Building (May 1, 1913) (Administration addition); Saskatchewan cojoined with Athabasca Hall (1964); Qu'Appelle Hall (1916); Marquis Hall adjoined to Place Riel ‚Äì Qu'Appelle Addition; Murray Memorial Main Library (1956); Arts (1960) cojoined with Law and adjoined to Commerce building complete the initial circle around the perimeter of the bowl. Francis Henry Portnall and Frank Martin designed the Dairy & Soils Laboratory (1947). =Establishment of colleges= Entrance to Thorvaldson Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan Roughly adhering to the original plan of 1909, numerous colleges were established: Arts & Science (1909); Agriculture, now called Agriculture and Bioresources (1912); Engineering (1912); Law (1913); Pharmacy, now called Pharmacy & Nutrition (1914); Commerce, now the N. Murray Edwards School of Business (1917); Medicine (1926); Education (1927); Home Economics (1928); Nursing (1938); Graduate Studies and Research (1946); Physical Education, now called Kinesiology (1958); Veterinary Medicine (1964); Dentistry (1965); and the School of Physical Therapy (1976). The U of S also has several graduate programs amongst these colleges, which give rise to a masters or doctorate degree. In 1966, the University of Saskatchewan introduced a masters program in adult education. Diploma, and certificate post secondary courses are also available to aid in professional development. Entrance to the Anthropology & Archaeology Building of the University of Saskatchewan Theological Colleges, affiliated with the university, were also established: Emmanuel College ‚Äì (Anglican denomination) (1909), St. Andrew's College (as Presbyterian College, Saskatoon) then United Church of Canada (1913), Lutheran Theological Seminary (1920), St. Thomas More College (1936), and Central Pentecostal College (1983).University of Saskatchewan Regina College was saved from bankruptcy and became part of the university in 1934, and was given degree-granting privileges in 1959, making it a second University of Saskatchewan campus. By another act of legislation in 1974, Regina College was made an independent institution known as the University of Regina. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. Correspondence courses were established in 1929. Other federated and affiliated colleges include Briercrest Bible College and Biblical Seminary in Caronport, Saskatchewan; Gabriel Dumont College and St. Peter's Historic Junior College in Muenster, Saskatchewan. Engineering Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan =Later development= In the late 1990s, the U of S launched a major revitalisation program, comprising new capital projects such as an expansion to the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, the building of a new parkade, and a revision of its internal road layout (which has already seen the East Road access being realigned). The Thorvaldson Building, which is home to the departments of chemistry and computer science, hosts a new expansion known as the Spinks addition. The College of Pharmacy and Nutrition has also had a number of renovations. =Land holdings= Up until the late 1980s, the University of Saskatchewan held an extensive area of land in the northeast quadrant of Saskatoon, stretching far beyond the core campus, east of Preston Avenue and north of the Sutherland and Forest Grove subdivisions. Much of this land was used for farming, though some areas were intended for future campus and facility development. In the late 1980s, most U of S land beyond Circle Drive was earmarked for residential development; Silverspring was the first of these neighbourhoods to be developed. The Royal University Hospital (1955 Wing) Another section of land, west of the Preston Avenue/Circle Drive interchange and north of the Canadian Pacific Railway line, was zoned for commercial use, and led to \\"big box\\" retail development in the early 2000s called Preston Crossing. Realignment of two major roads in the area around this same time (Preston Avenue and 108th Street) also used up a portion of university land. The U of S obtained a large tract of land immediately east of the Saskatoon city limits after the city annexed the northeastern section of U of S land (this land has since been itself annexed into the city). The U of S leased a site to the Correctional Service of Canada north of Attridge Drive on Central Avenue for the Regional Psychiatric Centre. It has an additional undeveloped parcel of land at Central Avenue and Fedoruk Drive. In the 1970s and again in the 1980s, the U of S considered opening up some of its land holdings south of College Drive and north of 14th Street for residential development, but opposition from nearby neighbourhoods that appreciated the \\"green belt\\" offered by the university led to these plans being dropped. The city has refrained from indicating any residential development plans for the newer land holdings in the northeast, allowing another green belt to be created separating the new communities of Evergreen and Aspen Ridge from other parts of the city. Rankings The University of Saskatchewan has placed in post-secondary school rankings. In the 2020 Academic Ranking of World Universities rankings, the university ranked 301‚Äì400 in the world and 13‚Äì18 in Canada. The 2021 Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed the university 401‚Äì500 in the world, and 17‚Äì18 in Canada. The 2021 QS World University Rankings ranked the university 465th in the world and sixteenth in Canada. In U.S. News & World Report 2021 global university rankings, the university placed 538th in the world, and 20th in Canada. In Maclean's 2021 ranking of Canadian universities, the university placed 15th in their medical- doctoral university category. The College of Engineering competes internationally through the University of Saskatchewan Space Design Team, which saw multiple first finishes at the X-Prize Foundation NASA challenges. The team was composed of undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and researchers drawn from across multiple disciplines. These finishes included world records in wireless energy transfer and space robotics technologies with features on Discovery Channel. The National Post and Financial Post \\"Top 500\\" ranking of Universities places the U of S 13th of the top 20 Canadian Universities with a population of 15,397 and revenue of $566,596,000. The Sidhpur Foundation places the University of Saskatchewan at spot 14 out of the top 25 universities in Canada. The Gourman Report Ranking of Canadian Universities gave the U of S a score of 3.28, which places it at spot 20 out of 60 Canadian Universities. The Globe and Mail's University Report Card reflects the opinions of 25,000 current undergraduates who responded to some 100 questions about their respective universities. The University of Saskatchewan received scores between B+ and A+ in the following categories *overall academic reputation of the university, reputation of university among employers, reputation for conducting leading-edge research, reputation for undergraduate studies, reputation for graduate studies *overall quality of education, faculty members' knowledge of subjects *overall university atmosphere, sense of personal safety/security, tolerance for diverse opinions/ideas, availability of quiet study space, overall library, library services, online library resources, availability of journals/articles/periodicals, total number of library holdings, computer accessibility on campus, availability of up-to-date computer equipment, on- campus network for Internet/email, overall quality/availability of technology on campus, access to course/teaching materials online.

These include Wilbur Jackett (1933) and Mark Abley (1975). Research Over the years, some of the most prominent projects at the University have been associated with the Department of Physics. In 1948, the university built the first betatron facility in Canada. Three years later, the world's first non-commercial cobalt-60 therapy unit was constructed. (The first female chancellor of the university, Sylvia Fedoruk, was a member of the cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan's lieutenant-governor from 1988 to 1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a linear accelerator as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. The Plasma Physics Laboratory operates a tokamak on campus. The University used the SCR-270 radar in 1949 to image the Aurora for the first time. Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada's national facility for synchrotron light research, the Canadian Light Source. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and is the size of a football field. The university also is home to the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. Innovation Place Research Park is an industrial science and technology park that hosts private industry working with the university. Apart from what goes on in these research facilities, the rank-and-file faculty are highly productive on the whole, across all the colleges and schools. Many faculty members have national and international scholarly reputations second to none. Consequently, they are magnets to Canadian and overseas graduate students and researchers.

The rivers were too shallow for propeller driven boats to navigate as the propeller would hit the river bottom. He investigated the American Hanley Hydro-Jet, a model which drew in water and fired it out through a steerable nozzle underneath the boat. Even when further adapted it did not work well. An employee suggested moving the nozzle to just above the waterline. When he took one of his early demonstration jet boats to the United States, the media scoffed when he said he planned to take it up the Colorado River, but in 1960 three Hamilton jet boats, the Kiwi, Wee Red and Dock, became the first and only boats to travel up through the Grand Canyon. The critics were silenced further when the boats went down river through the Grand Canyon to cache petrol just prior to the uprun.

The neighborhood is the fourth-largest central business district in New York City. Downtown Flushing, a major commercial and retail area centered around the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, is the third-busiest intersection in New York City, behind Times Square and Herald Square. Flushing was established as a settlement of New Netherland on October 10, 1645, on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek. It was named Vlissingen, after the Dutch city of Vlissingen. The English took control of New Amsterdam in 1664, and when Queens County was established in 1683, the \\"Town of Flushing\\" was one of the original five towns of Queens. In 1898, Flushing was consolidated into the City of New York. Development came in the early 20th century with the construction of bridges and public transportation. An immigrant population, composed mostly of Chinese and Koreans, settled in Flushing in the late 20th century. Flushing contains numerous residential subsections, and its diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside there. Flushing is served by several stations on the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch, as well as the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line (), which has its terminus at Main Street. Flushing is located in Queens Community District 7, and its ZIP Codes are 11354, 11355, and 11358. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 109th Precinct.  History  alt= = Precolonial and colonial history = Flushing was originally inhabited by the Matinecoc Indians prior to colonization and European settlement.  Dutch colony  On October 10, 1645, Flushing was established on the eastern bank of Flushing Creek under charter of the Dutch West India Company and was part of the New Netherland colony that was governed from New Amsterdam (Lower Manhattan). The settlement was named Vlissingen, after the city of Vlissingen, which was the European base of the Dutch West India company. By 1657, the residents called the place \\"Vlishing.\\" Eventually, the formal traditional English name for the Dutch town, \\"Flushing\\", would be settled upon (despite being a Dutch colony, many of the local early settlers were British, who trickled down from nearby Connecticut colony). Unlike all other towns in the region, the charter of Flushing allowed residents freedom of religion as practiced in Holland \\"without the disturbance of any magistrate or ecclesiastical minister.\\" However, in 1656, New Amsterdam Director-General Peter Stuyvesant issued an edict prohibiting the harboring of Quakers. On December 27, 1657, the inhabitants of Flushing approved a protest known as The Flushing Remonstrance. This petition contained religious arguments even mentioning freedom for \\"Jews, Turks, and Egyptians,\\" but ended with a forceful declaration that any infringement of the town charter would not be tolerated. Subsequently, a farmer named John Bowne held Quaker meetings in his home and was arrested for this and deported to Holland. Eventually he persuaded the Dutch West India Company to allow Quakers and others to worship freely. As such, Flushing is claimed to be a birthplace of religious freedom in the New World. Landmarks remaining from the Dutch period in Flushing include the John Bowne House on Bowne Street and the Old Quaker Meeting House on Northern Boulevard. The Remonstrance was signed at a house on the site of the former State Armory, now a police facility, on the south side Northern Boulevard between Linden Place and Union Street.  English colony  In 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam, ending Dutch control of the colony, and renamed it the Province of New York. When Queens County was established in 1683, the \\"Town of Flushing\\" was one of the original five towns which the county comprised. This later map shows former boundaries of the Town of Flushing. The map does not show the towns that were part of Queens and are now part of Nassau. Many historical references to Flushing are to this town, bounded from Newtown on the west by Flushing Creek (now Flushing River), from Jamaica on the south by the watershed, and from Hempstead on the east by what later became the Nassau County line. The town was dissolved in 1898 when Queens became a borough of New York City, and the term \\"Flushing\\" today usually refers to a much smaller area, for example the former Village of Flushing. Ash Street, now called Ash Avenue, in the early 20th century Flushing was a seat of power as the Province of New York up to the American Revolution was led by Governor Cadwallader Colden, based at his Spring Hill estate.New York Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. VIII, 1924, pgs 12-20Thompson, Benjamin Franklin. History of Long Island: Containing an Account of the Discovery and Settlement; with Other Important and Interesting Matters to the Present Time. 1838, page 381, Flushing was the site of the first commercial tree nurseries in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. A tract of Parsons's exotic specimens was preserved on the north side of Kissena Park. The nurseries are also commemorated in the names of west-east avenues that intersect Kissena Boulevard; the streets are named after plants and ordered alphabetically from Ash Avenue in the north to Rose Avenue in the south. Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward Project, now known as Central Park in Manhattan. Well into the 20th century, Flushing contained many horticultural establishments and greenhouses. During the American Revolution, Flushing, along with most settlements in present-day Queens County, favored the British and quartered British troops, though one battalion of Scottish Highlanders is known to have been stationed at Flushing during the war. Following the Battle of Long Island, Nathan Hale, an officer in the Continental Army, was apprehended near Flushing Bay while on what was probably an intelligence gathering mission and was later hanged. Flushing in 1882 The 1785 Kingsland Homestead, originally the residence of a wealthy Quaker merchant, now serves as the home of the Queens Historical Society. =19th century= Map of Flushing in 1891 During the 19th century, as New York City continued to grow in population and economic vitality, so did Flushing. Its proximity to Manhattan was critical in its transformation into a fashionable residential area. On April 15, 1837, the Village of Flushing was incorporated within the Town of Flushing. The official seal was merely the words, \\"Village of Flushing\\", surrounded by nondescript flowers. No other emblem or flag is known to have been used. The Village of Flushing included the neighborhoods of Flushing Highlands, Bowne Park, Murray Hill, Ingleside, and Flushing Park. The Flushing and North Side Railroad opened its Port Washington Branch to Flushing in 1854, providing access to Hunters Point on the East River shore.Vincent F. Seyfried, The Long Island Rail Road: A Comprehensive History, Part Two: The Flushing, North Shore & Central Railroad, ¬© 1963 By the mid-1860s, Queens County had 30,429 residents. The Village of College Point was incorporated in 1867,\\" and the Village of Whitestone was incorporated in 1868. The first free public high school in what is now New York City was established in Flushing in 1875. Flushing, then a small village, established a library in 1858, the oldest in Queens County and only slightly younger than the library of the City of Brooklyn (built in 1852). In 1898, although opposed to the proposal, the Town of Flushing (along with two other towns and other land of Queens County) was consolidated into the City of New York to form the new Borough of Queens. All towns, villages, and cities within the new borough were dissolved. Local farmland continued to be subdivided and developed transforming Flushing into a densely populated neighborhood of New York City. A major factor in this was the Halleran real estate agency. From the American Civil War to the end of the 1930s its slogan ‚ÄúAsk Mr. Halleran!‚Äù could be seen in ads all over Long Island, and the phrase from its maps ‚ÄúSo This Is Flushing‚Äù became a catchphrase. =20th-century development= The continued construction of bridges over the Flushing River and the development of other roads increased the volume of vehicular traffic into Flushing. In 1909, the Queensboro Bridge over the East River opened, connecting Queens County to midtown Manhattan. With the opening of Pennsylvania Station the next year, the Port Washington Branch, now part of the Long Island Rail Road, started running to midtown Manhattan. Broadway, a main roadway through Flushing, was widened and renamed Northern Boulevard. The Roosevelt Avenue Bridge over the Flushing River, which carries four lanes of traffic and the New York City Subway's elevated Flushing Line (), was the largest trunnion bascule bridge in the world when it was completed in 1927. The next year, the Main Street terminal of the Flushing subway line opened in downtown Flushing, giving the neighborhood direct subway access. Flushing was a forerunner of Hollywood, when the young American film industry was still based on the U.S. East Coast and Chicago. Decades later, the RKO Keith's movie palace would host vaudeville acts and appearances by the likes of Mickey Rooney, the Marx Brothers and Bob Hope. Asian communities Flushing Chinatown In the 1970s, immigrants from Taiwan established a foothold in Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white, interspersed with a small Japanese community. Additionally, a large South Korean population also called Flushing home. The Taiwanese immigrants were the first wave of Chinese immigrants who spoke Mandarin (Taiwanese also spoken) rather than Cantonese to arrive in New York City. Many Taiwanese immigrants were additionally Hokkien and had relatives or connections to Fujian province in China, which led to large influxes of Fuzhounese Americans. Over the years, many new non-Cantonese ethnic Chinese immigrants from different regions and provinces of China started to arrive in New York City and settled in Flushing through word of mouth. This wave of immigrants spoke Mandarin and various regional/provincial dialects. The early 1990s and 2000s brought a wave of Fuzhounese Americans and Wenzhounese immigrants, who mostly spoke Mandarin, and who settled in Flushing as well as Elmhurst. Flushing's Chinese population became diverse over the next few decades as people from different provinces started to arrive. Due to loosened emigration restrictions in mainland China, there has been a growing Northern Chinese population in Flushing. The regional food cuisines have led to Flushing being considered the \\"food mecca\\" for Chinese regional cuisine outside of Asia. =21st-century transformation= In the 21st century, Flushing has cemented its status as an international \\"melting pot\\", predominantly attracting immigrants from Asia, particularly from throughout the various provinces of China, but including newcomers from all over the world. Flushing Chinatown is centered around Main Street and the area to its west, most prominently along Roosevelt Avenue, which have become the primary nexus of Flushing Chinatown. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. The Flushing Chinatown houses over 30,000 individuals born in China alone, the largest Chinatown by this metric outside Asia and one of the largest and fastest-growing Chinatowns in the world. In January 2019, the New York Post named Flushing as New York City's \\"most dynamic outer-borough neighborhood.\\"Cuozzo, Steve (January 16, 2019) \\"The most exciting ‚Äôhood in New York is miles from Manhattan\\" New York Post Streetscape  Demographics  Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Flushing was 72,008, an increase of 2,646 (3.8%) from the 69,362 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010 , Population Division ‚Äì New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 9.5% (6,831) White, 4.2% (3,016) African American, 0.1% (74) Native American, 69.2% (49,830) Asian, 0.1% (59) Pacific Islander, 0.2% (172) from other races, and 1.8% (1,303) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 14.9% (10,723) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010 , Population Division ‚Äì New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community Board 7, which comprises Flushing, College Point, and Whitestone, had 263,039 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 84.3 years. This is longer than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged and elderly: 22% are between the ages of between 25‚Äì44, 30% between 45‚Äì64, and 18% over 65. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 17% and 7% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 7 was $51,284. In 2018, an estimated 25% of Flushing and Whitestone residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Flushing and Whitestone, higher than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Flushing and Whitestone are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. Cultural enclaves = Diverse Chinese communities= Flushing Chinatown, or Mandarin Town is the world's largest and one of the fastest-growing Chinatowns, known as the \\"Chinese Times Square\\" or the \\"Chinese Manhattan\\". In Mandarin, Flushing is known as \\"Falasheng\\" (). The Chinatown of Flushing is centered around the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, and many of the area's Chinese businesses are located on the blocks around, or west of, Main Street. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. In the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non-Hispanic white. Taiwanese began the surge of immigration, followed by other groups of Chinese. A 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population. However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. High rates of both legal and illegal immigration from Mainland China continue to spur the ongoing rise of the ethnic Chinese population in Flushing. According to a Daily News article in 2011, Flushing's Chinatown ranked as New York City's second largest Chinese community with 33,526 Chinese, surpassed only by the Brooklyn Chinatown (Â∏ÉÈ≤ÅÂÖãÊûóËèØÂü†), and larger than Manhattan's Chinatown.Flushing‚ÄìMain Street LIRR station Flushing now rivals Manhattan's Chinatown as a center of Chinese culture. The Lunar New Year Parade has become a growing annual celebration of Chinese New Year. In addition, several Chinese supermarkets such as Hong Kong Supermarket and New York Supermarket have locations in Flushing. The World Journal, one of the largest Chinese-language newspapers outside China, is headquartered in adjacent Whitestone.\\"Contact Us (Page in Chinese ) World Journal. Retrieved on 2014-03-10. \\"New York Headquarters 141-07 20th Ave. Whitestone, NY 11357\\" Numerous other Chinese- and English-language publications are available in Flushing, including SinoVision, one of North America's largest Chinese language television networks. The popular styles of Chinese cuisine are ubiquitously accessible in Flushing, including Hakka, Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Hunanese, Szechuan, Cantonese, Fujianese, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, and Korean Chinese cuisine. Even the relatively obscure Dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to Northeast China is now available in Flushing, as well as Mongolian cuisine and Uyghur cuisine. Varieties of Chinese spoken in Flushing include Mandarin Chinese, Fuzhou dialect, Min Nan (Hokkien), Wu Chinese (Wenzhounese, Shanghainese, Suzhou dialect, Hangzhou dialect), and Cantonese; in addition, the Mongolian language is now emerging. Given its rapidly growing status, the Flushing Chinatown has surpassed in size and population the original New York City Chinatown in the borough of Manhattan and this substantial growth has resulted in a commensurate rise in this Chinatown's cultural status. In accompaniment with its rapid growth, Flushing in particular has witnessed the proliferation of highly competitive businesses touted as educational centers as well as non-profit organizations declaring the intent to educate the community. Some entities offer education in Mandarin, the most spoken Chinese variety in mainland China. A diverse array of social services geared toward assisting recent as well as established Chinese immigrants is readily available in Flushing. = Korean community= Koreatown There is a Koreatown which originated in Flushing, but has since spread eastward to Murray Hill, Bayside, Douglaston, and Little Neck in Queens, and also into Nassau County. The Koreatown has historically been centered around Union Street, with the later growth being concentrated around Northern Boulevard east of Union Street. As of the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107. In the 1980s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants emerged into Flushing, many of whom began as workers in the medical field or Korean international students who had moved to New York City to find or initiate professional or entrepreneurial positions. They established a foothold on Union Street in Flushing between 35th and 41st Avenues, featuring restaurants and karaoke (noraebang) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, banking institutions, offices, consumer electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other commercial enterprises. As the community grew in wealth and population and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans expanded their presence eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes in more affluent and less dense neighborhoods in Queens and Nassau County. This expansion has led to the creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Murray Hill station. The eastward pressure to expand was also created by the inability to move westward due to the Flushing Chinatown on Main Street. Per the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107, representing the largest municipality in the United States with a density of at least 500 Korean Americans per square mile. The Korean American population, consisting of 218,764 individuals in the New York metropolitan area, is the second largest population of ethnic Koreans outside Korea. The Korea Times, a news organization based in Seoul, carries a significant presence in the Long Island Koreatown. The Long Island Koreatown features numerous restaurants that serve both traditional and/or regional Korean cuisine. Korean is spoken frequently alongside English and Chinese varieties, and retail signs employing the Hangul (ÌïúÍ∏Ä) alphabet are ubiquitous. A significant array of social services toward assisting recent and established Korean immigrants is available in Koreatown. There is also a significant population of Korean-Chinese or Chinese-Koreans in Flushing who can speak Mandarin, Korean, and English. =Other ethnic communities= The neighborhood of East Flushing, technically within Greater Flushing, also houses a substantial Chinese community along with most of Downtown Flushing. However, East Flushing also substantially includes Irish, Greek, Russian, Italian and Jewish communities, as well as communities of Indians, Sri Lankans, Malaysians, and Hispanics, mostly Colombians and Salvadorans. This neighborhood tends to be more diverse visibly than Downtown Flushing because of the more even distribution of the ethnicities of East Flushing residents resulting in more ethnic businesses catering to each community rather than the dominance of Chinese and to a lesser extent Korean businesses in Downtown Flushing. The northeastern section of Flushing near Bayside continues to maintain large Italian and Greek presences that are reflected in its many Italian and Greek bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants. The northwest is a mix of Jews, Greeks, and Italians. Most of central Flushing is an ethnic mix of Whites, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. Sri Maha Vallabha Ganapati Devasthanam Hindu Temple An area south of Franklin Avenue houses a concentration of Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, and Bangladeshi markets. This concentration of Indian American and other South Asian American businesses south of Franklin Avenue has existed since the late 1970s, one of the oldest Little India in North America. The Sri Maha Vallabha Ganapati Devasthanam (Sanskrit: ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§≠ ‡§ó‡§£‡§™‡§§‡§ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç, Tamil: ‡Æ∏‡Øç‡Æ∞‡ØÄ ‡ÆÆ‡Æï‡Ææ ‡Æµ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æ™ ‡Æï‡Æ£‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Æø ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Æ∏‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ©‡ÆÆ‡Øç) at 45-57 Bowne Street in Flushing was the very first of the traditional Hindu temples in the US.Famous Hindu chaplain honored at Hindu Sangathan Diwas celebrations in New York, August 27, 2007, http://www.asiantribune.com/node/7144 Vedanta Society in San Francisco (1906) or the Vedanta Center in Boston (1910) are sometimes considered to be the first Hindu temple in the US. However they were not fully consecrated traditional temples. However, Indians are migrating eastward into neighborhoods in northeastern Queens and into Nassau County, as with many Chinese and Korean immigrants. Subsections =Broadway-Flushing= Broadway-Flushing, also known as North Flushing, is a residential area with many large homes. Part of this area has been designated a State and Federal historic district due to the elegant, park-like character of the neighborhood. Much of the area has been rezoned by the City of New York to preserve the low density, residential quality of the neighborhood. The neighborhood awaits designation as an Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Broadway-Flushing is approximately bounded by 29th Avenue to the north, Northern Boulevard and Crocheron Avenue to the south, 155th Street to the west, and 172nd Streets to the east. =Linden Hill= Linden Hill is bound by 25th Avenue to Willets Point Boulevard to the north, 154th Street to the east, Northern Boulevard to the south and the Whitestone Expressway to the west. Linden Hill was originally a rural estate owned by the Mitchell family. Ernest Mitchell owned an adjacent area known as Breezy Hill and his father owned the area now called Linden Hill. The two areas are sometimes referred to as Mitchell-Linden. A major change in the rural nature of Linden Hill occurred in the early 1950s. Neisloss Brothers with architect Benjamin Braunstein envisioned a cooperative project to be set on Linden Hill and landfill of an adjacent swamp which would provide middle-income housing to veterans of World War II and the Korean War under Section 213 of the Federal Housing Act of 1950. Gerace and Castagna with architects Samuel Paul and Seymour Jarmul subsequently developed the larger Linden Towers several years after this. Paul was additionally the architect of Embassy Arms. In total, 41 six-story buildings containing 3,146 apartments comprising the Linden Hill, Mitchell Gardens, Linden Towers, and Embassy Arms cooperatives were erected. Once a primarily European-American neighborhood, Linden Hill is now a diverse mix of European-Americans, Asian-Americans and Latino-Americans. The Asian- American population has expanded markedly in the southern part of Linden Hill in the past decade (as it has throughout Flushing) and the Latino-American population has also grown noticeably. Conversely, the European-American population has lessened somewhat, though European-Americans still remain in great numbers north of Bayside Avenue, west of 149th Street. =Murray Hill= Murray Hill is bounded by 150th Street to the west and 160th Street to the east and straddles ZIP Codes 11354, 11355, and 11358. Traditionally the home of families of Irish and Italian immigrants, many Korean and Chinese immigrants have moved into Murray Hill in recent years. Murray Hill within Flushing is often confused with the larger Murray Hill neighborhood on the East Side of Manhattan. Before the area was developed for residential housing in 1889, Murray Hill was the location of several large nurseries owned by the King, Murray, and Parsons families. The Kingsland Homestead has been preserved as the home of the Queens Historical Society. The Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden is also located in Murray Hill. Comic strip artist Richard F. Outcault, the creator of The Yellow Kid and Buster Brown, lived on 147th Street in Murray Hill. =Queensboro Hill= Queensboro Hill in southern Flushing is bordered to the west by College Point Boulevard, to the north by Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park, to the south by Reeves Avenue and the Long Island Expressway, and to the east by Kissena Boulevard. Queensboro Hill is a part of ZIP Codes 11355 and 11367 and contains the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian/Queens hospital. One of the leading churches is the Queensboro Hill Community Church, a multi-racial congregation of the Reformed Church in America. Turtle Playground serves the residents of this section of Flushing. This area is often referred to as South Flushing. =Waldheim= Map of Waldheim, early 20th century The Waldheim neighborhood, an estate subdivision in Flushing constructed primarily between 1875 and 1925, is bound by Sanford and Franklin Avenues on the north, 45th Avenue on the south, Bowne Street on the west and Parsons Boulevard on the east. The area is immediately southeast of the downtown Flushing commercial core, and adjacent to Kissena Park. a small district of upscale \\"in-town\\" suburban architecture. Waldheim, German for \\"home in the woods\\", is known for its large homes of varying architectural styles and is laid out in an unusual street pattern. Waldheim was the home of some of Flushing's wealthiest residents until the 1960s. Notable residents include the Helmann family of condiment fame, the Steinway piano-making family, as well as A. Douglas Nash, who managed a nearby Tiffany glass plant. Starting in the 1980s, homes in Waldheim were destroyed by the Korean American Presbyterian Church of Queens, one of the area's largest land owners. In 2008 the city rezoned the neighborhood to help preserve the low density, residential character of the neighborhood. As with the Broadway neighborhood, preservationists have been unable to secure designation as an Historic District by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, and , structures in Waldheim were still being torn down. Points of interest =Houses of worship= Flushing is among the most religiously diverse communities in America. Today, Flushing abounds with houses of worship, ranging from the Dutch colonial epoch Quaker Meeting House, the historic Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Queens, St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church, St. George's Episcopal Church, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, the Congregation of Georgian Jews, St. Mel Roman Catholic Church, St. Michael's Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Shrine Church, Holy Annunciation Russian Orthodox Church, St. John's Lutheran Church, Queensboro Hill Community Church, Hindu Temple Society of North America, and the Muslim Center of New York. There are more than 200 houses of worship in Flushing. \\"Flushing has become a model for religious pluralism in America,\\" says R. Scott Hanson, a visiting assistant professor of history at the State University of New York at Binghamton and an affiliate of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University.\\" In 1657, while Flushing was still a Dutch settlement, a document known as the Flushing Remonstrance was created by Edward Hart, the town clerk, where some thirty ordinary citizens protested a ban imposed by Peter Stuyvesant, the director general of New Amsterdam, forbidding the harboring of Quakers. The Remonstrants cited the Flushing Town charter of 1645 which promised liberty of conscience. =Landmarks, museums, and cultural institutions= Flushing has many registered New York City Landmarks, several of which are also located on the National Register of Historic Places. Several city landmarks are located on the Queens Historical Society's Freedom Mile. Flushing Town Hall on Northern Boulevard is the headquarters of the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, and houses a concert hall and cultural center. Other landmarks include the Bowne House, Kingsland Homestead, the Weeping Beech, Old Quaker Meeting House, Flushing High School, St. George's Church, the Lewis H. Latimer House, and the inside of the former RKO Keith's movie theater. The Flushing Armory, on Northern Boulevard, was formerly used by the National Guard. There are several other landmarks in Flushing, but outside the Freedom Mile. These include the Protestant Reformed Dutch Church of Flushing, the Fitzgerald/Ginsberg Mansion, on Bayside Avenue and the Voelker Orth Museum, Bird Sanctuary and Victorian Garden. In addition, the Broadway-Flushing Historic District, Free Synagogue of Flushing, United States Post Office, and Main Street Subway Station (Dual System IRT) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Queens Botanical Garden is located on between College Point Boulevard and Main Street. It has been in operation continuously since its opening as an exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and has been at its current location since 1963. The Botanical Garden carries on Flushing's horticultural tradition that dates back to the area's 18th-century tree nurseries and seed farms. =Parks= Public parks and playgrounds in Flushing are supervised by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, an park, is the largest park in Queens.

The nervous system regulates and controls bodily functions and activity and consists of two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) comprising the branching peripheral nerves. It is composed of neurons, also known as nerve cells, which receive and transmit impulses, and neuroglia, also known as glial cells or glia, which assist the propagation of the nerve impulse as well as provide nutrients to the neurons. Nervous tissue is made up of different types of neurons, all of which have an axon. An axon is the long stem-like part of the cell that sends action potentials to the next cell. Bundles of axons make up the nerves in the PNS and tracts in the CNS. Functions of the nervous system are sensory input integration, control of muscles and glands, homeostasis, and mental activity. Structure Nervous tissue is composed of neurons, also called nerve cells, and neuroglial cells. Four types of neuroglia found in the CNS are astrocytes, microglial cells, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocytes. Two types of neuroglia found in the PNS are satellite cells and Schwann cells. In the central nervous system (CNS), the tissue types found are grey matter and white matter. The tissue is categorized by its neuronal and neuroglial components. =Components= Neurons are cells with specialized features that allow them to receive and facilitate nerve impulses, or action potentials, across their membrane to the next neuron. They possess a large cell body (soma), with cell projections called dendrites and an axon. Dendrites are thin, branching projections that receive electrochemical signaling (neurotransmitters) to create a change in voltage in the cell. Axons are long projections that carry the action potential away from the cell body toward the next neuron. The bulb-like end of the axon, called the axon terminal, is separated from the dendrite of the following neuron by a small gap called a synaptic cleft. When the action potential travels to the axon terminal, neurotransmitters are released across the synapse and bind to the post-synaptic receptors, continuing the nerve impulse. Neurons are classified both functionally and structurally. Functional classification: *Sensory neurons (afferent): Relay sensory information in the form of an action potential (nerve impulse) from the PNS to the CNS *Motor neurons (efferent): Relay an action potential out of the CNS to the proper effector (muscles, glands) *Interneurons: Cells that form connections between neurons and whose processes are limited to a single local area in the brain or spinal cord Structural classification: *Multipolar neurons: Have 3 or more processes coming off the soma (cell body). They are the major neuron type in the CNS and include interneurons and motor neurons. *Bipolar neurons: Sensory neurons that have two processes coming off the soma, one dendrite and one axon *Pseudounipolar neurons: Sensory neurons that have one process that splits into two branches, forming the axon and dendrite *Unipolar brush cells: Are excitatory glutamatergic interneurons that have a single short dendrite terminating in a brush-like tuft of dendrioles. These are found in the granular layer of the cerebellum. Neuroglia encompasses the non-neural cells in nervous tissue that provide various crucial supportive functions for neurons. They are smaller than neurons, and vary in structure according to their function. Neuroglial cells are classified as follows: *Microglial cells: Microglia are macrophage cells that make up the primary immune system for the CNS. They are the smallest neuroglial cell. *Astrocytes: Star-shaped macroglial cells with many processes found in the CNS. They are the most abundant cell type in the brain, and are intrinsic to a healthy CNS. *Oligodendrocytes: CNS cells with very few processes. They form myelin sheaths on the axons of a neuron, which are lipid-based insulation that increases the speed at which the action potential, can travel down the axon. *NG2 glia: CNS cells that are distinct from astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, and serve as the developmental precursors of oligodendrocytes *Schwann cells: The PNS equivalent of oligodendrocytes, they help maintain axons and form myelin sheaths in the PNS. *Satellite glial cell: Line the surface of neuron cell bodies in ganglia (groups of nerve body cells bundled or connected together in the PNS) *Enteric glia: Found in the enteric nervous system, within the gastrointestinal tract. =Classification of tissue= In the central nervous system: *Grey matter is composed of cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons, protoplasmic astrocytes (astrocyte subtype), satellite oligodendrocytes (non-myelinating oligodendrocyte subtype), microglia, and very few myelinated axons. *White matter is composed of myelinated axons, fibrous astrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and microglia. In the peripheral nervous system: *Ganglion tissue is composed of cell bodies, dendrites, and satellite glial cells. *Nerves are composed of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, Schwann cells surrounded by connective tissue. The three layers of connective tissue surrounding each nerve are: **Endoneurium. Each nerve axon, or fiber is surrounded by the endoneurium, which is also called the endoneurial tube, channel or sheath. This is a thin, delicate, protective layer of connective tissue. **Perineurium. Each nerve fascicle containing one or more axons, is enclosed by the perineurium, a connective tissue having a lamellar arrangement in seven or eight concentric layers. This plays a very important role in the protection and support of the nerve fibers and also serves to prevent the passage of large molecules from the epineurium into a fascicle. **Epineurium. The epineurium is the outermost layer of dense connective tissue enclosing the (peripheral) nerve. Function Myelinated axons conduct impulses faster than unmyelinated axons. The function of nervous tissue is to form the communication network of the nervous system by conducting electric signals across tissue. In the CNS, grey matter, which contains the synapses, is important for information processing. White matter, containing myelinated axons, connects and facilitates nerve impulse between grey matter areas in the CNS. In the PNS, the ganglion tissue, containing the cell bodies and dendrites, contain relay points for nerve tissue impulses. The nerve tissue, containing myelinated axons bundles, carry action potential nerve impulses. Clinical significance =Tumours= Neoplasms (tumours) in nervous tissue include: * Gliomas (glial cell tumors) :Gliomatosis cerebri, Oligoastrocytoma, Choroid plexus papilloma, Ependymoma, Astrocytoma (Pilocytic astrocytoma, Glioblastoma multiforme), Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour, Oligodendroglioma, Medulloblastoma, Primitive neuroectodermal tumor * Neuroepitheliomatous tumors :Ganglioneuroma, Neuroblastoma, Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, Retinoblastoma, Esthesioneuroblastoma * Nerve sheath tumors :Neurofibroma (Neurofibrosarcoma, Neurofibromatosis), Schwannoma, Neurinoma, Acoustic neuroma, Neuroma References Category:Tissues (biology) ","title":"Nervous tissue"},{"id":"267696","text":"Clark Virgil Terry Jr. (December 14, 1920 ‚Äì February 21, 2015) was an American swing and bebop trumpeter, a pioneer of the flugelhorn in jazz, and a composer and educator. He played with Charlie Barnet (1947), Count Basie (1948‚Äì51), Duke Ellington (1951‚Äì59), Quincy Jones (1960), and Oscar Peterson (1964-96). He was with The Tonight Show Band on the Tonight Show from 1962 to 1972. His career in jazz spanned more than 70 years, during which he became one of the most recorded jazz musicians, appearing on over 900 recordings. Terry also mentored Quincy Jones, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Wynton Marsalis, Pat Metheny, Dianne Reeves, and Terri Lyne Carrington.Terry, C. Clark: The Autobiography of Clark Terry, University of California Press (2011). Early life Terry was born to Clark Virgil Terry Sr. and Mary Terry in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 14, 1920.[ Yanow, Scott Clark Terry biography] at Allmusic. He attended Vashon High School and began his professional career in the early 1940s, playing in local clubs. He served as a bandsman in the United States Navy during World War II. His first instrument was valve trombone. Terry at the 1981 Monterey Jazz Festival Big band era Blending the St. Louis tone with contemporary styles, Terry's years with Basie and Ellington (who secretly recruited Terry away from Basie) in the late 1940s and 1950s established his prominence. During his period with Ellington, he took part in many of the composer's suites and acquired a reputation for his wide range of styles (from swing to hard bop), technical proficiency, and good humor. Terry influenced musicians including Miles Davis and Quincy Jones, both of whom acknowledged Terry's influence during the early stages of their careers. Terry had informally taught Davis while they were still in St Louis, and Jones during Terry's frequent visits to Seattle with the Count Basie Sextet. After leaving Ellington in 1959, Clark's international recognition soared when he accepted an offer from the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to become a staff musician. He appeared for ten years on The Tonight Show as a member of the Tonight Show Band until 1972, first led by Skitch Henderson and later by Doc Severinsen, where his unique \\"mumbling\\" scat singing led to a hit with \\"Mumbles\\". Terry was the first African American to become a regular in a band on a major US television network. He said later: \\"We had to be models, because I knew we were in a test.... We couldn't have a speck on our trousers. We couldn't have a wrinkle in the clothes. We couldn't have a dirty shirt.\\" Terry continued to play with musicians such as trombonist J. J. Johnson and pianist Oscar Peterson, and led a group with valve-trombonist Bob Brookmeyer that achieved some success in the early 1960s. In February 1965, Brookmeyer and Terry appeared on BBC2's Jazz 625. and in 1967, presented by Norman Granz, he was recorded at Poplar Town Hall, in the BBC series Jazz at the Philharmonic, alongside James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Bob Cranshaw, Louie Bellson and T-Bone Walker. In the 1970s, Terry concentrated increasingly on the flugelhorn, which he played with a full, ringing tone. In addition to his studio work and teaching at jazz workshops, Terry toured regularly in the 1980s with small groups (including Peterson's) and performed as the leader of his Big B-A-D Band (formed about 1970). After financial difficulties forced him to break up the Big B-A-D Band, he performed with bands such as the Unifour Jazz Ensemble. His humor and command of jazz trumpet styles are apparent in his \\"dialogues\\" with himself, on different instruments or on the same instrument, muted and unmuted. Later career Terry in New York City, 1976 From the 1970s through the 1990s, Terry performed at Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, and Lincoln Center, toured with the Newport Jazz All Stars and Jazz at the Philharmonic, and was featured with Skitch Henderson's New York Pops Orchestra. In 1998, Terry recorded George Gershwin's \\"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\\" for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Red Hot + Rhapsody, a tribute to George Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. In November 1980, he was a headliner along with Anita O'Day, Lionel Hampton and Ramsey Lewis during the opening two-week ceremony performances celebrating the short-lived resurgence of the Blue Note Lounge at the Marriott O'Hare Hotel near Chicago. Prompted early in his career by Billy Taylor, Clark and Milt Hinton bought instruments for and gave instruction to young hopefuls, which planted the seed that became Jazz Mobile in Harlem. This venture tugged at Terry's greatest love: involving youth in the perpetuation of jazz. From 2000 onwards, he hosted Clark Terry Jazz Festivals on land and sea, held his own jazz camps, and appeared in more than fifty jazz festivals on six continents. Terry composed more than two hundred jazz songs and performed for eight U.S. Presidents. He also had several recordings with major groups including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Dutch Metropole Orchestra, and the Chicago Jazz Orchestra, hundreds of high school and college ensembles, his own duos, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, octets, and two big bands: Clark Terry's Big Bad Band and Clark Terry's Young Titans of Jazz. In February 2004, Terry guest starred as himself, on Little Bill, a children's television series. Terry was a resident of Bayside, Queens, and Corona, Queens, New York, later moving to Haworth, New Jersey, and then Pine Bluff, Arkansas.Berman, Eleanor, \\"The jazz of Queens encompasses music royalty\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, January 1, 2006. Accessed October 1, 2009. \\"When the trolley tour proceeds, Mr. Knight points out the nearby Dorie Miller Houses, a co-op apartment complex in Corona where Clark Terry and Cannonball and Nat Adderley lived and where saxophonist Jimmy Heath still resides.\\"Potter, Beth. \\"Haworth's Notable Characters\\", Haworth, New Jersey. Accessed June 22, 2010. His autobiography was published in 2011. Taylor Ho Bynum wrote in The New Yorker that it \\"captures his gift for storytelling and his wry humor, especially in chronicling his early years on the road, with struggles through segregation and gigs in juke joints and carnivals, all while developing one of most distinctive improvisational voices in music history.\\"Taylor Ho Bynum, \\"The Sound of Musical Joy: Clark Terry's Trumpet\\", The New Yorker, February 24, 2015. According to his own website Terry was \\"one of the most recorded jazz artists in history and had performed for eight American Presidents.\\" In April 2014, the documentary Keep on Keepin' On, followed Terry over four years, to document his mentorship of the 23-year-old blind piano prodigy Justin Kauflin, as the Kauflin prepared to compete in an elite, international competition. In December 2014 the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis and C√©cile McLorin Salvant visited Terry, who had celebrated his 94th birthday on December 14, at the Jefferson Regional Medical Center. A lively rendition of \\"Happy Birthday\\" was played. Death and tributes Terry performing at the White House with singer Nnenna Freelon in 2006 On February 13, 2015, it was announced that Terry had entered hospice care to manage his advanced diabetes. He died on February 21, 2015. Writing in The New York Times, Peter Keepnews said Terry \\"was acclaimed for his impeccable musicianship, loved for his playful spirit and respected for his adaptability. Although his sound on both trumpet and the rounder-toned flugelhorn (which he helped popularize as a jazz instrument) was highly personal and easily identifiable, he managed to fit it snugly into a wide range of musical contexts.\\" Writing in UK's The Daily Telegraph, Martin Chilton said: \\"Terry was a music educator and had a deep and lasting influence on the course of jazz. Terry became a mentor to generations of jazz players, including Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis and composer-arranger Quincy Jones.\\" Interviewing Terry in 2005, fellow jazz trumpeter Scotty Barnhart said he was \\"... one of the most incredibly versatile musicians to ever live ... a jazz trumpet master that played with the greatest names in the history of the music ...\\" Chapter 3: Clark Terry, pp. 91-96. Southeast Missouri State University hosts the Clark Terry/Phi Mu Alpha Jazz Festival, an annual tribute to the musician. The festival began in 1998, and has grown in size every year. The festival showcases outstanding student musicians and guest artists at the university's River Campus. The University of New Hampshire hosts the Clark Terry Jazz Festival every year; it showcases middle- and high-school jazz musicians from all over New England. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Clark Terry among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

It was formed on November 7, 1987, as a continuation of the American Lutheran Church denomination, the majority of which merged with the Lutheran Church in America and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The AALC offices were originally in Bloomington, Minnesota. The national office moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 2007. It has 67 congregations, with about 16,000 members, in 2008. Its current Presiding Pastor is the Rev. Dr. Curtis E. Leins. Historical Background The AALC began with 12 congregations and had, as of 2008, grown to 70 congregations spread across 23 states. The AALC sees itself as a confessional Lutheran church body in the United States. At its beginning, the AALC defined itself by what it saw as maintaining a commitment to the authority of Holy Scripture and the teaching of the Lutheran confessions by way of retaining the Confession of Faith of the American Lutheran Church. The AALC operates its own seminary, the American Lutheran Theological Seminary, originally located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In fall 2005, the seminary relocated to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and is hosted by Concordia Theological Seminary of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS). The AALC holds to the inerrancy of scripture. It does not ordain women as pastors. However, women may serve as deaconesses. The AALC has two paths to ordination. In addition to serving in congregations, its rostered pastors also serve as chaplains in the U.S. Armed Services, hospitals, correctional facilities, law enforcement, hospice, and a host of other specialized ministries. Two AALC pastors are well known within confessional Lutheranism: Chris Rosebrough of Pirate Christian Radio and Jordan Cooper, who is an author, conference speaker, and host of the Just and Sinner podcasts. The AALC is also the denominational home of Trinity Lutheran Church of San Pedro, California, which was a key church in the Lutheran Renewal movement in the 60's under the leadership of the Rev. Larry Christensen. Fellowship with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod Starting in 1989, representatives of the AALC and the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) met in a series of official and unofficial talks. After six official meetings, at which various doctrinal papers were submitted, representatives of both the AALC and the LCMS recommended to their respective church bodies that they enter into altar and pulpit fellowship with one another. The proposal was brought before theology/doctrine commissions of each church body before being presented at their respective national conventions. During the June 20‚Äì23, 2007, AALC National Convention, the AALC declared fellowship with the LCMS; and voted to join the International Lutheran Council. On July 16, 2007, the LCMS declared fellowship with the AALC during the LCMS 63rd Regular Convention.

It is the main international airport for the Cayman Islands as well as the main base for Cayman Airways. The airport is named after British Royal Air Force (RAF) Wing Commander Owen Roberts, a pioneer of commercial aviation in the country, and is one of the two entrance ports to the Cayman Islands. Owen Roberts International Airport was the only international airport remaining in the Caribbean to have an open-air observation \\"waving gallery\\" until January 2017 when it was closed due to reconstruction. The upgraded Owen Roberts International Airport passenger terminal no longer has an outdoor observation \\"waving gallery\\". The runway length includes a displaced threshold on Runway 26. The Grand Cayman non-directional beacon (Ident: ZIY) is located short of the approach threshold of Runway 08. The Grand Cayman VOR/DME (Ident: GCM) is located short of Runway 08. History Wg Cdr. Owen Roberts was a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force, during World War II. Following the war, Roberts retired and later founded Caribbean International Airways (CIA). By 1950, Roberts had established regular service between Cayman and Tampa, Florida; Kingston, Jamaica; and Belize. During the early 1950s, Caribbean International Airlines was operating weekly seaplane service between Grand Cayman and both Tampa and Kingston with Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft as the airstrip on Grand Cayman had yet to be completed. Roberts worked to lobby Cayman Islands Commissioners Ivor Smith and Andrew Gerrard to build airfields on all three of the Cayman Islands. In 1952, construction started on an official airstrip at an estimated cost of ¬£93,000 to construct airports on all three Cayman Islands, a runway, along with a terminal was constructed on Grand Cayman at the cost of ¬£100,000. Owen Roberts had acquired two used Lockheed Lodestar twin prop airliners purchased to keep up with the competition whose interest was now piqued by the soon-to-be completed airfield at George Town. The inaugural flight of CIA, Ltd. from Kingston, Jamaica to Grand Cayman was set for 10 April 1953. Tragically, however, the Lodestar piloted by Roberts crashed on takeoff from Palisadoes Airport. 13 people, including the 40-year-old Roberts, were killed. The only survivor of the crash was Roberts' brother-in-law, Lt. Col. Edward Remington-Hobbs. Roberts was survived by a wife, Patricia, and their two daughters, in London. His grandson unfortunately passed before him, his name was Will Roberts. He died in a car crash in East End with his best friend Spencer Grainger. The Grand Cayman Island Airport was later named after the late Wg Cdr. Roberts in his honour.  Previous expansion projects  In 2007, the Cayman Islands Government announced plans to expand and upgrade the existing airport. Plans include the expansion of the check-in area, the purchase of a new X-ray machine and baggage screening machine as well as the employment of additional passenger screening staff. Phase 1 of the project, the expansion of the airport's car parks and the airport's pick-up and drop-off locations have already been completed. Additional renovations completed in 2012 include refurbishing the departure hall interior and livening up the passport control and customs hall with aquatic paintings and use of an aggressive digital advertising campaign in the baggage claim area.  Current expansion projects  Owen Roberts International Airport 2019 In 2014, Airport Authority unveiled a new plan to perform major renovations at Owen Roberts International Airport as part of a master plan to renovate and redevelop all three Cayman Islands airports. The new plan would expand the current terminal building, passenger parking, public parking, staff parking, aprons, Taxi area, extend the current runway and in the middle to long term build a second terminal building called the Greenspace Terminal and a parallel taxiway. This new expansion will allow passenger airlines to fly their newer and larger aircraft to Owen Roberts International. British Airways currently serves the airport with Boeing 777-200 wide body aircraft. The BA operated 777 is the largest aircraft operating scheduled passenger service from Owen Roberts at the present time with flights to and from London Heathrow Airport (LHR) via an intermediate stop in Nassau, Bahamas in both directions. The expansion will also allow other airlines with wide body, long haul aircraft, such as the Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 747-400 and the Boeing 787-9, the opportunity to fly to Grand Cayman. The expansion work began in 2015 with a temporary extended departure hall being added to accommodate passenger traffic while the tendering process is completed and construction commenced. On 9 March 2015, the Florida-based company RS&H;, who are partnered with the Cayman Island Airport Authority, unveiled a new design for Owen Roberts International. This new design is based mostly around the design criteria created by Canadian firm WS&P; in 2014. Work on Owen Roberts estimated to cost around some $55 Million KYD. On 23 June 2015 it was confirmed by CIAA CEO Albert Anderson that construction work will start early August 2015, and is estimated to be finished in generally 2 years. Late in August 2015 it was determined that work would have to be delayed to early September. A ground breaking ceremony took place on 10 September 2015. In late Oct 2015 it was announced that phase 2 of the expansion is expected to start in the early part of 2016. Phase 1 of the expansion was completed on time and on budget by June 2016. Phase 2 began in July 2016. Part of the phase 2 reconstruction was the removal of the famous and only A-frame open-air observation \\"waving gallery\\" in the region as it was closed to public in January 2017. The expansion of the Terminal Building was completed in late February 2019 and grand reopening was on 27 March by Prince Charles on his royal visit to Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac on March 27 & 28, 2019. The expansion of the Apron area and strengthening and lengthening of the runway and taxiways project began in Summer 2019. A bid for contractors for the Runway lengthening project commenced and companies had been chosen. In late 2019 into early 2020 movement of wildlife, clearing of area and filling of the ponds west of the Runway, West of threshold 08 had commenced, and construction of runway lengthening and Apron expansion has begun. This phase expected to be completed by June 2020. Due to faster than expected passenger capacity of the newly redeveloped terminal building. Minister of Tourism announced that the phase of the Airport Master Plan that would see to development of the second Terminal building, also known as the Greenspace Terminal Building has been pushed forwards, to after the runway and apron lengthening and expansion phase. The Greenspace Terminal Building development will also include new Apron development, new Runway extension considerations, and Jet Bridges. In addition to the Greenspace Terminal Building development, additional expansion to seating on the Second Floor of the redeveloped Terminal will be done in the short term. As a result of the extension of the Grand Cayman Airport, airlines have extended their flight schedules. Recently, American Airlines has added new nonstop service to Boston, Chicago, and New York-JFK. Delta Air Lines has also expanded its schedules adding new flights to Grand Cayman from New York- JFK and adding additional frequencies from other hubs. Southwest has added Service to Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Houston Hobby airport. In addition, United Airlines has drastically expanded its schedules in recent months. This includes new daily nonstop flights from Newark, New Jersey to Grand Cayman through June and twice Daily service from Newark in the high season of April. American Airlines flies a mix of Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 Family aircraft to the island, Delta Airlines flies Boeing 757-200 aircraft, Boeing 737-800/900ER aircraft, and Airbus A320 Family aircraft, JetBlue flies Airbus A320 Family aircraft, Southwest flies a mix of Boeing 737 aircraft and United Airlines flies a mixture of Boeing 737-700/800/900ER aircraft. Cayman Airways, as a result of airport expansion, is planning new routes from the Cayman Islands and is exploring destinations in Canada and Los Angeles, California. The airport expansion brings the gate total to nine gates. Cayman Airways usually uses gates 1-3, American Airlines usually uses Gates 6-9, Jetblue usually uses gate 4 or 5, United Uses Gates 1-4, Delta uses gates 1-5, and Southwest uses Gate 6. All gates deplane via airstairs or ramps and gate assignments do change on occasion. British Airways' Twice weekly service on the Boeing 777 uses a specially configured Gate 1. Cayman Airways Cayman Airways, the national flag air carrier of the Cayman Islands, has its operational base at the airport. The airline began flights in August 1968 following the purchase of 51% of Cayman Brac Airways by the Cayman Islands Government from LACSA, an air carrier based in Costa Rica. The first aircraft type operated by Cayman Airways was a Douglas DC-3. International service was initially operated to Miami with a leased Douglas DC-6 propliner and the first jet operations were flown between the airport and Kingston, Jamaica with a British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven leased from LACSA. In 1972, the airline was operating its own stretched BAC One-Eleven series 500 jets on nonstop flights to Miami and Kingston as well as operating Douglas DC-3 service between Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Cayman Airways began nonstop flights to Houston via Intercontinental Airport in the late 1970s and by 1982 had replaced its BAC One-Eleven twin jets with Boeing 727-200 jetliners. Other aircraft types operated by the airline over the years included Boeing 727-100, 737-200, 737-400 and Douglas DC-8 jets. Cayman Airways currently operates Boeing 737-300 jetliners with nonstop service to destinations in Cuba, Honduras, Jamaica and the U.S. as well as local flights to Cayman Brac. Cayman Airways has upgraded their fleet of aircraft to include one Boeing 737-800NG and one Boeing 737 MAX 8, with an order of three more Boeing 737 MAX 8s to be delivered from March 2019 through to September 2020 which will then enable the eventual retirement of their 737-300s. Cayman Airways Express operates two commuter de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and two Saab 340B turboprop aircraft between Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Cayman Airways Express is to eventually retire both of its DHC 6-300 Twin Otters and was also planning to add another Saab 340B to its fleet. Cayman Airways Express was also planning to expand on short haul regional flights but has not yet announced any new schedules. The initiation of Cayman Airways flights to Panama City, Panama was anticipated to allow Brazilian tourists to travel to the Cayman Islands via Copa Airlines flights to Panama with connecting passengers then continuing on Cayman Airways flights to the airport. However, Cayman Airways is no longer serving Panama.  Historical airline service  Grand Cayman was being served with scheduled passenger flights by the early 1950s when British West Indian Airways (BWIA, which is now Caribbean Airlines) in association with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC, which is now British Airways) was operating one round trip flight a week on a routing of Kingston, Jamaica - Grand Cayman - Belize City, Belize with a Vickers Viking twin prop aircraft with this service being timed to connect to other BOAC and BWIA flights in Kingston. LACSA (which now operates as Avianca Costa Rica) was providing service by the mid-1950s with two round trip flights a week, one with a routing of San Jose, Costa Rica - Grand Cayman - Miami flown with a Convair 340 and the other with a routing of San Jose, Costa Rica - Grand Cayman - Havana, Cuba - Miami flown with a Curtiss C-46. By 1957, BWIA in association with BOAC had added Montego Bay, Jamaica as a stop on their Kingston-Belize route flown weekly via Grand Cayman. BWIA then introduced nonstop flights to Miami and in 1958 was operating Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft on a round trip routing of Kingston - Montego Bay - Grand Cayman - Miami twice a week. By 1963, British West Indian was operating daily Viscount propjet service into the airport with a round trip routing of Miami (MIA)-Grand Cayman (GCM)-Montego Bay (MBJ)-Kingston (KIN)-San Juan (SJU)-Antigua (ANU)-Barbados (BGI)-Port of Spain, Trinidad (POS). In 1964, LACSA was operating Douglas DC-6B propliner flights on a routing of San Jose, Costa Rica - Grand Cayman - Miami with round trip service twice weekly. The jet age arrived in Grand Cayman during the late 1960s when BWIA introduced Boeing 727-100 \\"Sunjet\\" service with a routing of Port of Spain, Trinidad - Barbados - Antigua - St. Lucia - San Juan, Puerto Rico - Kingston, Jamaica - Grand Cayman - Miami operated twice a week with a third weekly flight also being flown with the 727 nonstop between Grand Cayman and Miami. By 1970, LACSA had introduced jet service as well flying British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets nonstop to Miami eight times a week and also nonstop to San Jose, Costa Rica twice a week. LACSA continued to serve Grand Cayman through the late 1970s with nonstop flights to Miami operated with stretched BAC One-Eleven series 500 jets. By 1980, Air Jamaica was operating McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service nonstop to Kingston three days a week with a nonstop flight from Montego Bay being operated once a week. Another international airline flying from the airport was Faucett Peru which in 1985 was operating Douglas DC-8 jetliners between Peru and Miami three days a week via an intermediate stop in Grand Cayman. In 1993, SAHSA, an air carrier based in Honduras, was operating nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to La Ceiba, Honduras twice a week with continuing direct service to Tegucigalpa, Honduras.October 1993 OAG Desktop Flight Guide, Worldwide Edition By 1994, Air Jamaica was operating Boeing 727-200 jet service on a routing of Montego Bay - Kingston - Grand Cayman three days a week while Trans-Jamaican Airlines (which subsequently became Air Jamaica Express) was flying ATR 42 propjets on a routing of Montego Bay - Kingston - Grand Cayman - Belize City, Belize - Cancun, Mexico twice a week.15 September 1994 OAG Desktop Flight Guide, Grand Cayman schedules The first U.S.-based air carrier to serve Grand Cayman was Southern Airways which began service during the mid-1970s with nonstop Douglas DC-9-10 jet service between the airport and Miami.1 February 1976 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Grand Cayman schedules By the late 1970s, Southern was also operating a weekly nonstop between Fort Lauderdale and Grand Cayman flown with the DC-9 in addition to its daily nonstop service to and from Miami. Southern then merged with another U.S. airline to form Republic Airlines (1979-1986) which in 1979 was continuing to serve the airport with nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 flights to Miami. During the early and mid-1980s Republic was operating larger McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50 jetliners on its Grand Cayman-Miami route. In 1986 Republic was acquired by and merged into Northwest Airlines which in turn continued to serve Grand Cayman. In 1987, Northwest was flying McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets from the airport to Miami, Memphis, Tennessee and Montego Bay, Jamaica with daily nonstop service to all three destinations. U.S.-based regional air carriers Red Carpet Airlines and successor AeroSun International operated service between the airport and Tampa with Convair 440 prop aircraft with up to six flights a week during the early 1980s. By 1989, American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines and Pan Am had joined Northwest with regard to operating daily nonstop service between Grand Cayman and Miami with American, Eastern and Pan Am all flying Boeing 727-200 jetliners on the route. Locally based air carrier Cayman Airways was also continuing to fly nonstop service with Boeing 737-400 jets on its core Grand Cayman-Miami route at this time in the face of considerable competition posed by these four U.S.-based airlines with all five airlines operating a combined total of sixty (60) departures a week from the airport to Miami in December 1989. By 1994, American had added daily nonstop service to Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina flown with a Boeing 727-200 and had also introduced Boeing 757-200 jetliners on the Grand Cayman-Miami route while USAir (which was subsequently renamed US Airways and has now been merged into American Airlines) was operating nonstop flights to Charlotte, North Carolina three days a week as well as nonstop service to Tampa flown four days a week with both routes being operated with Boeing 727-200 jets.15 September 1994 OAG Desk Top Flight Guide, Grand Cayman schedules In 1996, British Airways was operating nonstop service from London Gatwick Airport once a week as well as weekly one stop service from London Gatwick via Nassau with both flights being operated with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 wide body jetliners.Oct. 27, 1996 OAG Pocket Flight Guide, European edition, London, UK flight schedule British Airways continues to serve Grand Cayman at the present time with direct Boeing 777-200 wide body flights from London Heathrow Airport via a stop in Nassau.

Located on the Black Sea's west coast on Varna Bay, along Lake Varna and Lake Beloslav, it also comprises the outlying port of Balchik. It has a significant further development potential with of sheltered inland waterfront on the lakes alone, easily accessible by road and railroad and adjacent to Varna International Airport.  Overview  There are two anchorages at Varna roadstead: summer and winter. If violent northeasterly wind and wave conditions make the anchorages hazardous, a foul weather anchorage is available west of the high Cape Kaliakra east-northeast of Varna. Frozen sea in Varna Two inland canals connect the sea and Port of Varna East with Lake Varna, Lake Beloslav and Port of Varna West: Channel 1 with draft 11.5 m and Channel 2 with draft 11.0 m. The canals form an island (–û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞) on which a deepwater oil terminal, among other port facilities, is currently located. The depths of the ship berths and the approaches allow the handling of vessels of capacity up to 50,000 gross tonnes. In view of the stated safe canal depths, only vessels of draft less than and airdraft up to are allowed to Varna West. Vessels with load over 200 m, beam over 26 m, or over 20,000 gross tonnes are required to pass the channels during daylight hours only. The largest vessel handled (as of 2006) is the Norwegian Dream cruise ship (220 m in length, 50,700 gross tonnes). The port in 1960s Port of Varna offers full service: loading, discharging, stevedoring, freight forwarding, storage and various intermodal services. For its approximately 40 berths, it operates 65 electric cranes and about 400 other pieces of ship, landside and warehouse port facilities. The port open-air storage area is and the warehouses . It has a well-forked railway and road network. The existing port facilities allow the handling of practically all kinds of solid bulk, break-bulk, containerized and some liquid-bulk cargoes. Principal exports include urea, soda ash, cement, clinker, silica, fertilisers, grain, containers and ro-ro. Principal imports are coal, metals, ores and ore concentrates, oil, phosphates, timber, molasses, containers and ro-ro. Since 2006, Port of Varna serves as a hub for BP and German wind turbine manufacturer Saga. In 2008, the port posted a 57% growth in overall tonnage handled, and at times in late summer it was stretched beyond capacity, due to redirected cargo from striking ports in the region and the year's record export of wheat from northeastern Bulgaria.  Future plans  The updated general plan for the Port of Varna to 2020 was approved in 1999. Major projects for new construction, reconstruction and modernization include: a deepwater container terminal and a ro-ro terminal on the island under the Asparuhov most bridge, a grain terminal on the north shore of Lake Varna south of the Dry Port storage base, a liquid chemicals terminal and a cement and clinker terminal at Varna West, and modernization of the passenger and ro-ro terminals at Varna East. In 2007, new plans were disclosed to relocate the container terminal from Varna East to a new larger basin on the northeastern shore of Lake Varna and to redevelop old port Varna East, located in the city centre, into a large marine attractions zone with a new cruise terminal, yacht marina, apartments, hotels, restaurants, museums, exhibitions, shopping, and other tourist facilities. In 2008, plans were disclosed for another deepwater container terminal on the south side of the island for vessels carrying over 2500 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). A liquified petroleum gas terminal is also being developed at Beloslav. Amidst the gas crisis of early 2009, discussions started of a new liquified natural gas terminal on , possibly on the northwestern shore of Lake Varna at Ezerovo. Also in 2008, discussions were resumed (suspended in 1981) for a 192 km long navigable canal Rousse-Varna connecting the lower river Danube with the Varna lakes and the Black Sea, but this enterprise is still considered economically unfeasible and utopian by many. Other existing port terminals include the Cruise Terminal; Petrol, LesPort, and Varna Thermal Power Plant (handling oil, timber, and coal respectively); the Railroad Ferry Terminal, which is not part of the complex, is located on the south shore of Lake Beloslav opposite Varna West.

As such, it gets a three-part infraspecific name. It is sometimes recommended that the subspecies rank should be used to recognize geographic distinctiveness, whereas the variety rank is appropriate if the taxon is seen throughout the geographic range of the species. Example The pincushion cactus, Escobaria vivipara (Nutt.) Buxb., is a wide-ranging variable species occurring from Canada to Mexico, and found throughout New Mexico below about . Nine varieties have been described. Where the varieties of the pincushion cactus meet, they intergrade. The variety Escobaria vivipara var. arizonica is from Arizona, while Escobaria vivipara var. neo-mexicana is from New Mexico. Definitions The term is defined in different ways by different authors. However, the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants, while recognizing that the word \\"variety\\" is often used to denote \\"cultivar\\", does not accept this usage. Variety is defined in the code as follows: \\"Variety (varietas) the category in the botanical nomenclatural hierarchy between species and form (forma)\\". However the code acknowledges the other usage as follows: \\"term used in some national and international legislation for a clearly distinguishable taxon below the rank of species; generally, in legislative texts, a term equivalent to cultivar. See also: cultivar and variety (varietas)\\". A variety will have an appearance distinct from other varieties, but will hybridize freely with those other varieties (if brought into contact). Other nomenclature uses * In plant breeding nomenclature, at least in countries that are signatory to the UPOV Convention, \\"variety\\" or \\"plant variety\\" is a legal term. * In zoological nomenclature, the only allowed rank below that of species is that of subspecies. A name that was published before 1961 as that of a variety is taken to be the name of a subspecies. A name published after 1960 as that of a variety does not formally exist. In zoology, forms and morphs are used informally if needed, but are unregulated by the ICZN. * In bacteriological nomenclature, \\"variety\\" is not allowed, but names published as varieties before 1992 are taken to be published as subspecies. * In viticulture nomenclature, what is referred to as \\"grape varieties\\" are in reality cultivars according to usage in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants or \\"plant varieties\\" in the legal sense rather than botanical taxonomy varieties, since they are propagated by cuttings and have properties that are not stable under sexual reproduction. However, usage of the term variety is so entrenched in viticulture that a change to cultivar is unlikely.

Campbell Jr., written under the pen name Don A. Stuart. It was first published in the August 1938 Astounding Science Fiction. The novella has been adapted four times as a film: the first in 1951 as The Thing from Another World; the second in 1972 as Horror Express, the third in 1982 as The Thing, directed by John Carpenter; and most recently as a prequel to the Carpenter version, also titled The Thing, released in 2011. A fifth film, again with Carpenter involved, is in development from Blumhouse Productions. In 2010, Peter Watts wrote the award-winning short story The Things, retelling the novella's and 1982 film's events from the alien's point of view with a creative commons licence. As of 2019, an official sequel is being written by John Gregory Betancourt, after the release of the first draft of the novella, an expanded novel written by Campbell Jr. titled Frozen Hell. Plot A group of scientific researchers, isolated in Antarctica by the nearly-ended winter, discover an alien spaceship buried in the ice, where it crashed twenty million years before. They try to thaw the inside of the spacecraft with a thermite charge, but end up accidentally destroying it when the ship's magnesium hull is ignited by the charge. However, they do recover the alien pilot from the ancient ice, which the researchers believe was searching for heat when it was frozen. Thawing revives the alien, a being which can assume the shape, memories, and personality of any living thing it devours, while maintaining its original body mass for further reproduction. Unknown to them, the alien immediately kills and then imitates the crew's physicist, a man named Connant; with some 90 pounds of its matter left over it tries to become a sled dog. The crew discovers the dog-Thing and kills it in the process of transformation. Pathologist Blair, who had lobbied for thawing the Thing, goes insane with paranoia and guilt, vowing to kill everyone at the base in order to save mankind; he is isolated within a locked cabin at their outpost. Connant is also isolated as a precaution and a \\"rule-of-four\\" is initiated in which all personnel must remain under the close scrutiny of three others. The crew realizes they must isolate their base and therefore disable their airplanes and vehicles, yet they pretend things are normal during radio transmissions to prevent any rescue attempts. The researchers try to figure out who may have been replaced by the alien (simply referred to as the Thing), in order to destroy the imitations before they can escape and take over the world. The task is almost impossibly difficult when they realize that the Thing is also telepathic, able to read minds and project thoughts. A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections (from Copper and Garry) to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits. The initial test of Connant is inconclusive as they realize that the test animal received both human and alien blood, meaning that either Doctor Copper or expedition Commander Garry is actually an alien. Assistant commander McReady takes over and deduces that all the other animals at the station, save the test dog, have already become imitations; all are killed by electrocution and their corpses burned. Everyone suspects each other by now but must stay together for safety, deciding who will take turns sleeping and standing watch. Tensions mount and some men begin to go mad thinking they are already the last human or wondering if they would even know if they weren't human any longer. Ultimately, Kinner, the cook, is murdered and accidentally revealed to be a Thing. McReady realizes that even small pieces of the creature will behave as independent organisms. He then uses this fact to test which men have been \\"converted\\" by taking blood samples from everyone and dipping a heated wire in the vial of blood. Each man's blood is tested, one at a time, and the donor is immediately killed if his blood recoils from the wire; fourteen men in all, including Connant and Garry, are revealed to be aliens. The remaining men go to test the isolated Blair and on the way see the first albatross of the Antarctic spring flying overhead; they shoot the bird to prevent a Thing from infecting it and flying to civilization. When they reach Blair's cabin they discover he is a Thing. They realize that it has been left to its own devices for a week, coming and going as it pleased as it is able to squeeze under doors by transforming itself. With the creatures inside the base destroyed, McReady and two others enter the cabin to kill the Thing that was once Blair. McReady forces it out into the snow and destroys it with a blowtorch. Afterwards the trio discover that the Thing was dangerously close to finishing the construction of an atomic-powered anti-gravity device that would have allowed it to escape to the outside world.  Characters  =Secondary magnetic expedition= Although the expedition based at Big Magnet comprises 37 members, only 16 are named in the story, and all but three by last name alone.

In the two later film adaptions, the Things retains their ability to shapeshift, although they do not have telepathic abilities. * Charnauk: lead Alaskan husky, first openly attacked by the Thing * Chinook and Jack: two other huskies  Versions  Two slightly different versions of the original novella exist. It appeared in Astounding in a 12-chapter version, which also appears in Adventures in Time and Space and The Antarktos Cycle (under the title The Thing from Another World). An extended 14-chapter version appears in The Best of John W. Campbell and the Who Goes There? collection. In 2018, it was found that Who Goes There? was actually a shortened version of a larger novel previously written by Campbell. The expanded manuscript (including an entirely different opening), titled Frozen Hell, was found in a box of manuscripts sent by Campbell to Harvard University. The discovery was made by author and biographer Alec Nevala-Lee, during his research on a biography of Campbell and other authors from the Golden Age of Science Fiction. A Kickstarter campaign was launched to publish the full novel. When completed on December 1, the campaign had raised more than $155,000, compared to its original $1,000 goal. E-book versions of the novel, published by Wildside Press, began distributing digitally to campaign backers on January 16, 2019, with physical copies following in June the same year. In January 2020, a new film, to be produced by Jason Blum's Blumhouse Productions and released and distributed by Universal Pictures (as a part of the former's first-look deal) was going to be made based on the new, expanded version of the original book.  Critical reception  In 1973, the story was voted by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the stories representing the \\"most influential, important, and memorable science fiction that has ever been written\\". It was published with the other top voted stories in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two. Adaptations =Film= The Thing from Another World (1951) is a loose adaptation of the original story. It features James Arness as the Thing, Kenneth Tobey as the Air Force officer, and Robert O. Cornthwaite as the lead scientist. In this adaptation, the alien is a humanoid invader (i.e., two arms, two legs, a head) from an unknown planet. A plant-based life form, the alien and its race need animal blood to survive. He, or rather it, is a one-alien army, capable of creating an entire army of invaders from seed pods contained in (his) body. The John Carpenter 1982 adaptation The Thing, sticks more closely to Campbell's original story. Carpenter remade the film due to The Thing from Another World being one of his favorite films, and the 1951 adaptation is an Easter egg in Carpenter's original Halloween. Carpenter directed the film from a Bill Lancaster screenplay. Carpenter's idea was not to compete with the direction of the earlier film. In both the novella and this adaptation, the Thing can imitate any animal-based life form, absorbing the respective hosts' personalities and memories along with their bodies (although the telepathy aspect is omitted). When the story begins, the creature has already been discovered and released from the ice by another expedition. This version maintains the digestions and transformations alluded to in the original novella, via practical effects such as animatronics and stop motion animation. A third adaptation, also titled The Thing, was released on October 14, 2011. The 2011 acts as a prequel to the 1982 film, explaining the fate of the expedition which originally found the creature and its ship. The movie follows Carpenter's version, with the creature depicted using a combination of costume effects and computer-generated imagery. William F. Nolan, author of Logan's Run, also wrote a Who Goes There? screen treatment for Universal Studios in 1978; however, it was not published until 2009 in the Rocket Ride Books edition of Who Goes There?. Nolan's alternate take on Campbell's story reduced down the number of characters, replaced the single alien with a group of three, and downplayed monster elements in favor of an \\"impostor\\" theme, in a vein similar to The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney. In January 2020, Universal and Blumhouse Productions announced a new film based on the new, expanded version of the original book, Frozen Hell. =Comics= H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld and Alberto Breccia adapted the story as \\"Tres ojos\\" (Spanish: \\"Three Eyes\\") for their Sherlock Time series, published in the Argentine comic book Hora Cero (issue 89‚Äî104) from May to August 1959. In 1976, the story was also published in comic book form in issue 1 of Starstream (script by Arnold Drake and art by Jack Abel). In 1991 Dark Horse Comics published a two-issue miniseries The Thing From Another World. In July 1992, a 4 issue miniseries sequel was published, The Thing From Another World: Climate of Fear. =Radio drama= The story has been adapted as a radio drama multiple times, including by BBC Radio 4 in their Chillers series (24 January 2002), and the Suspense radio drama series (2013). The earliest adaptation was for the Exploring Tomorrow radio series in 1958 (under the title The Escape), hosted by John W. Campbell, Jr. himself; however, no recordings of this episode are known to exist. =Board and video games= The Thing (2010 card game) and The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31 (2017 board game) are both based on the John Carpenter movie. Who Goes There?, a board game from Certifiable Studios, was released in May 2018, following a Kickstarter campaign, which raised over $612,000 compared to its $54,097 goal. In March 2020, Certifiable Studios launched a Kickstarter for a second edition of the game with \\"updated mechanics\\" and \\"additional expansion characters.\\" It is available either as a complete game, or as an add-on for those with the first edition game already. Its initial goal was $34,097 and as of March 19, has raised over $300,000 in pledges. In 2002, Universal Interactive and Konami co-published the video game The Thing, released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2. A third-person shooter survival horror video game, set as a sequel to John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name , director who even voices a character in an uncredited cameo. . The game was a commercial success, selling over one million units worldwide across all platforms. Cultural impact = In literature = In December 1936, John W. Campbell published a story titled \\"Brain Stealers of Mars\\" in Thrilling Wonder Stories, which also features shape-shifting, mind-reading aliens. The earlier story has a humorous tone, but takes a philosophical note as members of another alien race describe living stoically alongside the shapeshifters. Writer A. E. van Vogt was inspired by Who Goes There? to write Vault of the Beast (1940), which he submitted to Astounding Science Fiction. \\"I read half of it standing there at the news-stand before I bought the issue and finished it,\\" van Vogt later recalled. \\"That brought me back into the fold with a vengeance. I still regard that as the best story Campbell ever wrote, and the best horror tale in science fiction.\\"Fantasy Review Volume 1 No. 4, Aug.-Sep. 1947 The Thing is one of the aliens featured in Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials (1979; second edition 1987). Barlowe's main illustration depicts the Thing halfway through its transformation into a sled dog. The story is referenced, and embedded within The Rack of Baal (1985), a 'choose- your-own-adventure' gamebook written by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson, about a time-travelling special agent called \\"The Falcon\\". A section of the plot plays out on a frozen world occupied by a single mining station crewed by only a few people. One inhabitant is one called 'Sil McReady', who, in a cynical inversion of the original story, actually turns out to be infected with the alien organism. In 2010, Canadian science fiction writer Peter Watts published and podcast a short story called \\"The Things\\" in which the alien entity from \\"Who Goes There?\\" is the first-person narrator. The characters and events in \\"The Things\\" are the same as those in the 1982 John Carpenter film. Confused, damaged, and unfamiliar with earth biology, the alien‚Äîa well-meaning ambassador‚Äîonly slowly begins to understand why it has been received with such hostility, and that the humans are individuals who do not want to be assimilated. Upon figuring this out, it is utterly revulsed by the \\"thinking cancers.\\" \\"The Things\\" was nominated for a number of awards, including the Hugo; it won the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award for best short story. In 2011, \\"The Things\\" was recorded and released by Escape Pod as an audio podcast. = In film and television = David Denby of New York magazine suggested that Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Alien (1979) may have been influenced by Campbell's story. The 1993 episode \\"Ice\\" of the science fiction TV series The X-Files borrows its premise from the storyline. In the 1995 Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"The Adversary,\\" a shapeshifting alien infiltrates the crew of a starship. The episode explores similar themes of paranoia and contains a \\"blood test\\" scene. The writers have cited The Thing from Another World as inspiration. The 2013 episode \\"The Thingy!\\" of the family action-comedy series The Aquabats! Super Show! also borrows the story's premise, albeit in a much more comedic tone. The fourth episode of the first season of the HBO crime drama True Detective, first broadcast in 2014, is named after the novella. = In other media = In 2006, Dark Horse Comics released a pre-painted snap together model kit of the alien as described in the original short story. It was sculpted and painted by Andrea Von Sholly. The model was unlicensed and was simply titled 'The Space Thing'. The 2018 video game Among Us has been considered a spiritual adaptation of the story and its film adaptations. Inspired by the party game Mafia, players take the role of a group of isolated astronauts, one or more of whom is an impostor plotting the demise of the remainder of the crew. Though the game diverges from many of the specifics of the story, most notably in that its impostors merely kill rather than replace the crew, its gameplay creates a markedly similar atmosphere of paranoia and fear and encourages players to replicate elements of the story, such as the \\"rule of four\\" and litmus tests to prove one's identity.

Rubbing alcohol is denatured and undrinkable even if it is ethanol based, due to the bitterants added. They are liquids used primarily as a topical antiseptic. They also have multiple industrial and household uses. The term \\"rubbing alcohol\\" in North American English is a general term for either isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) or ethyl alcohol (ethanol) products. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) defines \\"isopropyl rubbing alcohol USP\\" as containing approximately 70 percent alcohol by volume of pure isopropyl alcohol and defines \\"rubbing alcohol USP\\" as containing approximately 70 percent by volume of denatured alcohol. In Ireland and the UK, the comparable preparation is surgical spirit B.P., which the British Pharmacopoeia defines as 95% methylated spirit, 2.5% castor oil, 2% diethyl phthalate, and 0.5% methyl salicylate. Under its alternative name of \\"wintergreen oil\\", methyl salicylate is a common additive to North American rubbing alcohol products. Individual manufacturers are permitted to use their own formulation standards in which the ethanol content for retail bottles of rubbing alcohol is labeled as and ranges from 70 to 99% v/v. All rubbing alcohols are unsafe for human consumption: isopropyl rubbing alcohols do not contain the ethyl alcohol of alcoholic beverages; ethyl rubbing alcohols are based on denatured alcohol, which is a combination of ethyl alcohol and one or more bitter poisons that make the substance toxic. History The term \\"rubbing alcohol\\" came into prominence in North America in the mid-1920s. The original rubbing alcohol was literally used as a liniment for massage; hence the name. This original rubbing alcohol was rather different from today's precisely formulated surgical spirit; in some formulations it was perfumed and included different additives, notably a higher concentration of methyl salicylate. The name \\"rubbing\\" also emphasized that the alcohol was not intended for consumption, a significant distinction in Prohibition-era America; nonetheless it had become a well-documented surrogate alcohol as early as 1925.  Properties  All rubbing alcohols are volatile and flammable. Ethyl rubbing alcohol has an extremely bitter taste from additives. The specific gravity of Formula 23-H is between 0.8691 and 0.8771 at . Isopropyl rubbing alcohols contain from 50% to 99% by volume of isopropyl alcohol, the remainder consisting of water. Boiling points vary with the proportion of isopropyl alcohol from ; likewise, freezing points vary from . Surgical spirit BP boils at . Naturally colorless, products may contain color additives. They may also contain medically-inactive additives for fragrance, such as wintergreen oil (methyl salicylate), or for other purposes.  US legislation  To protect alcohol tax revenue in the United States all preparations classified as Rubbing Alcohols (defined as those containing ethanol) must have poisonous additives to limit human consumption in accordance with the requirements of the US Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, using Formula 23-H (8 parts by volume of acetone, 1.5 parts by volume of methyl isobutyl ketone, and 100 parts by volume of ethyl alcohol). It contains 87.5‚Äì91% by volume of absolute ethyl alcohol. The rest consists of water and the denaturants, with or without color additives, and perfume oils. Rubbing alcohol contains in each 100 ml more than 355 mg of sucrose octaacetate or more than 1.40 mg of denatonium benzoate. The preparation may be colored with one or more color additives. A suitable stabilizer may also be added.Expert Committee:(PA2)Pharmaceutical Analysis 2, USP28‚ÄìNF23 Page 62, Pharmacopeial Forum:Volume No.27(3)Page 2507  Warnings  Product labels for rubbing alcohol include a number of warnings about the chemical, including the flammability hazards and its intended use only as a topical antiseptic and not for internal wounds or consumption. It should be used in a well-ventilated area due to inhalation hazards. Poisoning can occur from ingestion, inhalation, absorption, or consumption of rubbing alcohol.

With its strategic location between the Scheldt river and the North Sea, Vlissingen has been an important harbour for centuries. It was granted city rights in 1315. In the 17th century Vlissingen was a main harbour for ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). It is also known as the birthplace of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. Vlissingen is mainly noted for the yards on the Scheldt where most of the ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy (Koninklijke Marine) are built.  Geography  The municipality of Vlissingen consists of the following places: * City: Vlissingen * Villages: Oost-Souburg, Ritthem, and West-Souburg * Hamlet: Groot-Abeele History Vlissingen from the sea, 1662 The Arrival at Vlissingen of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, by Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom, oil on canvas. The fishermen's hamlet that came into existence at the estuary of the Schelde around AD 620 has grown over its 1,400-year history into the third-most important port of the Netherlands. The Counts of Holland, Flanders, and Zeeland had the first harbours dug. Over the centuries, Vlissingen developed into a hub for fishing, especially the herring fishery, commerce, privateering and the slave trade. Under the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585, English garrisons were stationed here and at Brill to keep these ports out of Spanish hands. The towns were sold back to the Dutch in 1616.Garrett Mattingly (1959), The Armada, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, Ch. V, \\"Plans of Operations\\", p. 44. During the heyday of the Dutch Golden Age, ships from Vlissingen set sail for the various outposts of the Dutch colonial empire and contributed to the world power of The Seven Provinces. The history of Vlissingen was also marked by invasion, oppression and bombardments. Because of its strategic position at the mouth of the Schelde, the most important passageway to Antwerp, it has attracted the interest, at one time or another, of the British, the French, the Germans and the Spanish. Floods have also been a constant threat. Vlissingen declined during the 18th century. The Napoleonic Wars were particularly disastrous. After 1870, the economy revived after the construction of new docks and the Walcheren canal, the arrival of the railway and the establishment of the shipyard called De Schelde. The Second World War interrupted this growth. The city was heavily damaged by shelling and inundation but was captured and liberated by British Commandos of 4th Special Service Brigade on 3 November 1944. The city was rebuilt after the war. In the 1960s, the seaport and industrial area of Vlissingen-Oost developed and flourished. Now this area is the economic driving force behind central Zeeland, generating many thousands of jobs. Nowadays approx. 50,000 ships annually from all corners of the world pass through the Schelde.www.zeegat.nl/ Vlissingen's seaside boulevard at the start of the 21st century. Name =Etymology= The derivation of the name Vlissingen is unclear, though most scholars relate the name to the word fles (\\"bottle\\") in one way or another. According to one story, when saint Willibrord landed in Vlissingen with a bottle in the 7th century, he shared its contents with the beggars he found there while trying to convert them. A miracle occurred, typical of hagiography, when the contents of the bottle did not diminish. When the bishop realised the beggars did not want to listen to his words, he gave them his bottle. After that, he supposedly called the city Flessinghe. Another source states that the name had its origins in an old ferry-service house, on which a bottle was attached by way of a sign. The monk Jacob van Dreischor, who visited the city in 967, then apparently called the ferry-house het veer aan de Flesse (\\"the ferry at the Bottle\\"). Because many cities in the region later received the appendix -inge, the name, according to this etymology, evolved to Vles-inge. According to another source, the name was derived from the Danish word Vles, which means \\"tides\\". The eastern cape of Novaya Zemlya, Cape Flissingsky was named after the city in 1596 by Willem Barentsz. =Historical English name \\"Flushing\\"= Vlissingen was historically called \\"Flushing\\" in English. In the 17th century Vlissingen was important enough to be a town that English speakers referred to and that had acquired its own English name. For example, Samuel Pepys referred to the town as \\"Flushing\\" in his diaries. In 1673 Sir William Temple referred to Vlissingen as \\"Flushing\\" once and \\"Flussingue\\" twice in his book about the Netherlands.Sir William Temple, Observations upon the United Provinces of the Netherlands, ed. Sir George Clark (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1672), pp. 40, 48 & 116 Some English writers in the Netherlands also used the Dutch name. Flushing, originally a Dutch colonial village founded in 1645 and now part of Queens, New York City, was first called Vlissingen after the town in the Netherlands. The English settlers who also came to live in the villageRussell Shorto, The Island at the Centre of the World (Black Swan, 2004) pp. 338-9 shortened the name to \\"Vlissing\\" by 1657 and then began to call it by its English name \\"Flushing.\\" The Anglicisation of \\"Vlissingen\\" into \\"Flushing\\" did not occur after the conquest of New Netherland, but in England well before then. This village was the site of the Flushing Remonstrance. The village of Flushing in Cornwall was also named after Vlissingen. Originally named Nankersey, the village was given its name by Dutch engineers from Vlissingen in the Netherlands who built the three main quays in the village. Michigan and Ohio in the US have villages called Flushing as well.

Each jurisdiction determines what is legal tender, but essentially it is anything which when offered (\\"tendered\\") in payment of a debt extinguishes the debt. There is no obligation on the creditor to accept the tendered payment, but the act of tendering the payment in legal tender discharges the debt. Some jurisdictions allow contract law to overrule the status of legal tender, allowing for example merchants to specify that they will not accept cash payments.Paul M. Horvitz, Monetary Policy and the Financial System, p. 14, Prentice-Hall, 3rd ed. (1974). Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender in many countries, but personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are usually not. Some jurisdictions may include a specific foreign currency as legal tender, at times as its exclusive legal tender or concurrently with its domestic currency. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made by other than legal tender. In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes, which is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person means that a would-be purchaser may not force a purchase merely by presenting legal tender, as legal tender only must be accepted for debts already incurred. Under U.S. federal law, cash in U.S. dollars is a valid and legal offer of payment for antecedent debts when tendered to a creditor. By contrast, federal statutes do not require a seller to accept federal currency or coins as payment for goods or services simultaneously exchanged. Therefore, private businesses may formulate their own policies on whether to accept cash unless state law requires otherwise. Etymology  The term \\"legal tender\\" is from Middle French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \\"extend\\" (to hold outward).Definition of tender as verb, in Merriam-Webster . Retrieved 13 July 2009. Withdrawal and replacement =Demonetization= Demonetization is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. It occurs whenever there is a change of national currency: The current form or forms of money is or are pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency. The opposite of demonetization is remonetization, in which a form of payment is restored as legal tender. Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency replace them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one. Examples of this are: *During Nazi occupation of Netherlands, 500 & 1000 guilders were demonetized, and after liberation 100 guilder was also demonetized. Anne Frank in her diary entry on March 19, 1943 notes: > Thousand-guilder notes are being declared invalid. That'll be a blow to the > black marketeers and others like them, but even more to people in hiding and > anyone else with money that can't be accounted for. To turn in a thousand- > guilder bill, you have to be able to state how you came by it and provide > proof. They can still be used to pay taxes, but only until next week. The > five-hundred notes will lapse at the same time. Gies & Co. still had some > unaccounted-for thousand-guilder bills, which they used to pay their > estimated taxes for the coming years, so everything seems to be above board. Piet Lieftinck's measure of demonetizing 100 guilder was aimed at war profiteers. *On October 6, 1944, 100 franc was demonetized. People having 100 francs were allowed to exchange up to 2000 francs per household for new banknotes. Banks added withdrawal limits and checking accounts were frozen. *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971, Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p ‚Äì 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (¬Ωp, 1p, 2p ‚Äì equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, and 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2¬Ωp), 1, and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin- operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed by exchanging them for legal tender currency with no time limits; but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit). *India demonetised its 500 and 1000 rupee notes on 8 November 2016. This action affected 86 percent of all cash in circulation. The demonetisation action was intended to curb black money, the hoarding of unaccounted cash, and sponsorship of terrorism, but also led to long queues from bank runs, leaving more than 30 people dead. The old notes are now being replaced by new 500 and 2000 rupee notes. *The Philippines has ceased 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of Flora and Fauna Series in 2000, due to overminting of the coins of BSP Series that has not included the 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of that series. Individual coins or banknotes can be demonetised and cease to be legal tender (for example, the pre-decimal United Kingdom farthing or the Bank of England 1 pound note), but the Bank of England does redeem all Bank of England banknotes by exchanging them for legal tender currency at its counters in London (or by post) regardless of how old they are. Banknotes issued by retail banks in the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland) are not legal tender, but one of the criteria for legal protection under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act is that banknotes must be payable on demand, therefore withdrawn notes remain a liability of the issuing bank without any time limits. In the case of the euro, coins and banknotes of former national currencies were in some cases considered legal tender from 1 January 1999 until 28 February 2002. Legally, those coins and banknotes were considered non-decimal sub-divisions of the euro. When the Iraqi Swiss dinar ceased to be legal tender in Iraq, it still circulated in the northern Kurdish regions, and despite lacking government backing, it had a stable market value for more than a decade. This example is often cited to demonstrate that the value of a currency is not derived purely from its legal status (but this currency would not be legal tender). This is also true of the paper money issued by the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The Confederate currency became worthless by its own terms after the war, since it could only be redeemed a stated number of years after a peace treaty was signed between the Confederacy and the United States (which never happened, as the Confederacy was defeated and dissolved). Demonetisation is currently prohibited in the United States, and the Coinage Act of 1965 applies to all US coins and currency regardless of age. The closest historical equivalent in the US, other than Confederate money, was from 1933 to 1974, when the government banned most private ownership of gold bullion, including gold coins held for non-numismatic purposes. Now, however, even surviving pre-1933 gold coins are legal tender under the 1964 act. =Withdrawal from circulation= Banknotes and coins may be withdrawn from circulation, but remain legal tender. United States banknotes issued at any date remain legal tender even after they are withdrawn from circulation. Canadian 1- and 2-dollar bills remain legal tender even if they have been withdrawn and replaced by coins, but Canadian $1,000 bills remain legal tender even if they are removed from circulation as they arrive at a bank. However, Bank of England notes that are withdrawn from circulation generally cease to be legal tender but remain redeemable for current currency at the Bank of England itself or by post. All paper and polymer issues of New Zealand banknotes issued from 1967 onwards (and 1- and 2-dollar notes until 1993) are still legal tender; however, 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins are no longer used in New Zealand. =Cashless society= A cashless society describes an economic state whereby financial transactions are not conducted with money in the form of physical banknotes or coins, but rather through the transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties. Cashless societies have existed, based on barter and other methods of exchange, and cashless transactions have also become possible using digital currencies such as bitcoin. Commemorative issues Sometimes currency issues such as commemorative coins or transfer bills may be issued that are not intended for public circulation but are nonetheless legal tender. An example of such currency is Maundy money. Some currency issuers, particularly the Scottish banks, issue special commemorative banknotes which are intended for ordinary circulation (though no Scottish banknotes nor notes from Northern Ireland are legal tender in the United Kingdom). As well, some standard coins are minted on higher-quality dies as 'uncirculated' versions of the coin, for collectors to purchase at a premium; these coins are nevertheless legal tender. Some countries issue precious-metal coins which have a currency value indicated on them which is far below the value of the metal the coin contains: these coins are known as \\"non-circulating legal tender\\" or \\"NCLT\\". Status by country =Australia= The Australian dollar, comprising notes and coins, is legal tender in Australia. Australian notes are legal tender by virtue of the Reserve Bank Act 1959, s.36(1),Reserve Bank Act 1959, s.36(1) without an amount limit. The Currency Act 1965Currency Act 1965, s.16 similarly provides that Australian coins intended for general circulation are also legal tender, but only for the following amounts: *not exceeding 20¬¢ if 1¬¢ and/or 2¬¢ coins are offered, *not exceeding $5 if any of 5¬¢, 10¬¢, 20¬¢ and 50¬¢ coins are offered, *not exceeding 10 times the face value if the coins offered are greater than 50¬¢ up to and including $10, *to any value for coins of other denominations above $10.CURRENCY ACT 1965 The 1¬¢ and 2¬¢ coins were withdrawn from circulation from February 1992 but remain legal tender. Although the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and the Currency Act 1965 establishes that Australian banknotes and coins have legal tender status, Australian banknotes and coins do not necessarily have to be used in transactions and refusal to accept payment in legal tender is not unlawful. It appears that a provider of goods or services is at liberty to set the commercial terms upon which payment will take place before the \\"contract\\" for supply of the goods or services is entered into. If a provider of goods or services specifies other means of payment prior to the contract, then there is usually no obligation for legal tender to be accepted as payment. This is the case even when an existing debt is involved. However, refusal to accept legal tender in payment of an existing debt, where no other means of payment/settlement has been specified in advance, conceivably could have consequences in legal proceedings. Australia Post prohibits the sending of coins or banknotes, of any country, except via registered post.\\"Dangerous and prohibited goods and packaging guide\\" , 'Australia Post', Accessed: 31 July 2015 History In 1901, notes in circulation in Australia consisted of bank notes payable in gold coin and issued by the trading banks, and Queensland Treasury notes. Bank notes circulated in all States except Queensland, but were not legal tender except for a brief period in 1893 in New South Wales. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue and other provisions for the protection of the public. Queensland Treasury notes were issued by the Queensland Government and were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Australian Notes Act 1910 and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910. The Australian Notes Act 1910 prohibited the circulation of state notes as money, and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910 imposed a tax of 10%, per annum, on \\"all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed\\". These Acts effectively put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. The Reserve Bank Act 1959 expressly prohibits persons and states from issuing \\"a bill or note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation\\".Reserve Bank Act 1959, s.43, 44 =Canada= In general, Canadian dollar banknotes issued by the Bank of Canada and coins issued under the authority of the Royal Canadian Mint Act are legal tender in Canada. However, commercial transactions may legally be settled in any manner agreed by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, convenience stores may refuse $100 bank notes if they feel that would put them at risk of being counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice. Under the Currency Act, there are limits to the value of a transaction for which only coins are used. A payment in coins is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins: #$40 if the denomination is $2 to $10, #$25 if the denomination is $1, #$10 if the denomination is 10c to $1, #$5 if the denomination is 5c, and #25c if the denomination is 1c. In the case of coins of a denomination greater than $10, a payment is a legal tender for no more than the value of a single coin of that denomination. Where more than one amount is payable by one person to another on the same day under one or more obligations, the total of those amounts is deemed to be one amount due and payable on that day. =China= In the People's Republic of China, the official currency renminbi serves as the unlimited legal tender for all transactions. It is by law that any public institution or individual must not refuse using the currency to settle public or private domestic owing. =Eurozone= Euro coins and banknotes became legal tender in most countries of the Eurozone on 1 January 2002. Although one side of the coins is used for different national marks for each country, all coins and all banknotes are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Although some eurozone countries do not put 1 cent and 2 cent coins into general circulation (prices in those countries are by general understanding always rounded to whole multiples of 5 cent), 1 cent and 2 cent coins from other eurozone countries remain legal tender in those countries. Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 limits the number of coins that can be offered for payment to fifty. Governments that issue the coins must establish the euro as the only legal tender. Due to variations on the legislative meaning of legal tender in various member states and the ability of contract law to overrule the status of legal tender, it is possible for merchants to choose to refuse to accept euro banknotes and coins within specific countries within the Eurozone (the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Ireland). National laws may also impose restrictions as to maximal amounts that can be settled by coins or notes. =France= Legal tender was enacted the first time for gold and silver coins in the French Penal Code of 1807 (art. 475, 11¬∞). In 1870, legal tender was extended to all notes of the Banque de France. Anyone refusing such coins for their whole value would be prosecuted (French Penal Code art. R. 642-3). =Republic of Ireland= According to the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998 of the Republic of Ireland which replaced the legal tender provisions that had been re-enacted in Irish legislation from previous British enactments, \\"No person, other than the Central Bank of Ireland and such persons as may be designated by the Minister by order, shall be obliged to accept more than 50 coins denominated in euro or in cent in any single transaction.\\" History The Decimal Currency Act, 1970 governed legal tender prior to the adoption of the euro and laid down the analogous provisions as in United Kingdom legislation (all inherited from previous UK law), namely: coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding ¬£10, coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding ¬£5, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence. =Republic of India= The Indian rupee is the de facto legal tender currency in India. The Indian rupee is also legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan, but the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are not legal tender in India. Both the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are pegged with the Indian rupee. The Indian rupee used to be an official currency of other countries, including the Straits Settlements (now Singapore and parts of Malaysia), Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Trucial States (now the UAE). In 1837, the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency of the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as a part of India. In 1845, the British replaced the Indian rupee with the Straits dollar after administration of the Straits Settlements separated from India earlier in that same year. Indian rupees were stamped with Government of Pakistan to be used as legal tenders in the new state of Pakistan in 1947. After partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistani rupee came into existence, initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with the word \\"Pakistan\\". New coins and banknotes were issued in 1948. The Gulf rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf rupee (XPGR), was introduced by the Government of India as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act of 1 May 1959. This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India's foreign reserves by gold smuggling. Two states, Kuwait and Bahrain eventually replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies (the Kuwaiti dinar and the Bahraini dinar) after gaining independence from Britain in 1961 and 1965, respectively. On 6 June 1966, India devalued the rupee. To avoid following this devaluation, several of the states using the rupee adopted their own currencies. Qatar and most of the Trucial States adopted the Qatar and Dubai riyal, whilst Abu Dhabi adopted the Bahraini dinar. Only Oman continued to use the Gulf rupee until 1970, with the government backing the currency at its old peg to the pound. Oman later replaced the Gulf rupee with its own rial in 1970. On 8 November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that existing INR 500 and INR 1000 banknotes would no longer be accepted as legal tender with a view to curb counterfeiting, tax evasion and the parallel economy. The Reserve Bank of India outlined a scheme for holders of such banknotes to either deposit them into their bank accounts for full, unlimited value, or to exchange the banknotes for new, subject to a cap. =New Zealand= New Zealand has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, either from 6 January 1840 (when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand) or from 14 January 1840 (when Captain Hobson (of the Royal Navy) was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand). The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in New Zealand. (Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank (established in 1934) did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the Minister of Finance.) The history of bank notes in New Zealand was considerably more complex. In 1840 the Union Bank of Australia started issuing bank notes under provisions of British law, but these were not automatically legal tender. In 1844 ordinances were passed making the Union Bank banknotes legal tender and authorising the government to issue debentures in small denominations, thus creating two sets of legal tender. These debentures were circulated but were traded at a discount to their face value because of distrust of the colonial government amongst the settler population. In 1845 the British Colonial office disallowed the Ordinance and the debentures were recalled, not without first causing a panic among holders. In 1847 the Colonial Bank of Issue became the only issuer of legal tender. In 1856, however, the Colonial Bank of Issue was disbanded; and through the Paper Currency Act 1856 the Union Bank was confirmed once again as an issuer of legal tender. The Act also authorised the Oriental Bank to issue legal tender - but this bank ceased operations in 1861. Between 1861 and 1874, a number of other banks including the Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of New South Wales, the National Bank of New Zealand and the Colonial Bank of New Zealand were created by Acts of Parliament and authorised to issue bank-notes backed by gold, however these notes were not legal tender. The 1893 Bank Note Issue Act allowed the government to declare a bank's right to issue legal tender. This enabled the government to make such a declaration to assist the Bank of New Zealand when in 1895 the bank encountered financial difficulties that could have led to its failure. In 1914 the Banking Amendment Act gave legal-tender status to bank notes from any issuer and removed the requirement that banks authorised to issue bank notes must redeem them on demand for gold (the gold standard). In 1933 the Coinage Act authorised a specific New Zealand coinage and removed legal-tender status from British coins. In the same year the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was established. The bank was given a monopoly on the issue of legal tender. The Reserve Bank also provided a mechanism through which the other issuers of legal tender could phase out their bank notes. These banknotes were convertible into British legal tender on demand at the Reserve Bank and remained so until the 1938 Sterling Exchange Suspension Notice that suspended provisions of a 1936 amendment of the 1933 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act. In 1964 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act re-stated that only notes issued by the Reserve Bank were legal tender. The Act also ended the right of individuals to redeem their bank notes for coin, effectively ending the distinction between coin and notes in New Zealand. The Act came into force in 1967, establishing as legal tender all New Zealand dollar five- dollar banknotes and greater, all decimal coins, the pre-decimal sixpence, the shilling, and the florin. Also passed in 1964 was the Decimal Currency Act, which created the basis for a decimal currency, introduced in 1967. banknotes were legal tender for all payments, and $1 and $2 coins were legal tender for payments up to $100, and 10c, 20c, and 50c silver coins were legal tender for payments up to $5. These older-style silver coins were legal tender until October 2006, after which only the new 10c, 20c and 50c coins, introduced in August 2006, remained legal. =Norway= The Norwegian krone (NOK) is legal tender in Norway according to the Central Bank () of 24 May 1985. However, no- one is obliged to accept more than 25 coins of each denomination (of which currently 1, 5, 10 and 20 NOK denominations are in common circulation). =Singapore and Brunei= Singapore and Brunei have a Currency Interchangeability Agreement since 12 June 1967. Under the agreement, Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar are exchangeable at par without charge in both countries. As such, the currency of one country is accepted in the other country as \\"customary tender\\". =Switzerland and Liechtenstein= The Swiss franc is the only legal tender in Switzerland. Any payment consisting of up to 100 Swiss coins is legal tender; banknotes are legal tender for any amount.Art. 3 of the Swiss law on Monetary Unit and means of payment. German , French and Italian versions. The sixth series of Swiss bank notes from 1976, recalled by the National Bank in 2000, is no longer legal tender, but can be exchanged in banks for current notes until April 2020. The Swiss franc is also the legal tender of the Principality of Liechtenstein, which is joined to Switzerland in a customs union. The Swiss franc is also the currency used for administrative and accounting purposes by most of the numerous international organisations that are headquartered in Switzerland. =Taiwan= The New Taiwan dollar issued by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is legal tender for all payments within the territory of the Republic of China, Taiwan.Article 13 of The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) Act. However, since 2007,Legislative History of the Civil Servants Election And Recall Act, the 21st version: \\"The full text of 134 Articles amended and promulgated by President Order Hua-Tsung (1) Yi-Tzu No. 09500075641 on November 7, 2007 and enforced accordingly\\". candidates to become civil servants in elections in the Republic of China may no longer pay any deposit in coinage.Article 32 of the Civil Servants Election And Recall Act. =Thailand= Series 2 banknotes first issued in 1925 during the reign of Rama VI and continuing into the reign of Rama VII added the legend, > Promise to pay (silver to) bearer on demand in (silver) currency of Siam; later changed in 1928 to be in line with The Currency Act, B.E. 2471 to > This note is legal tender (literal translation, silver in payment of debt) > according to law. The front has a guilloche design with twelve rays, and the back, depictions of the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. These were printed in 6 denominations ‚Äì 1, 5, 10, 20,100 and 1000 baht ‚Äì in two types printed by De La Rue of London, England. =United Kingdom= Legal tender is solely for the guaranteed settlement of debts and does not affect any party's right of refusal of service in any transaction. In the 19th century, gold coins were legal tender to any amount, but silver coins were not legal tender for sums over 2 pounds nor bronze for sums over 1 shilling. This provision was retained in revised form at the introduction of decimal currency, and the Coinage Act 1971 laid down that coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, non-bronze coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence. Throughout the United Kingdom, coins valued 1 pound, 2 pounds, and 5 pounds sterling are legal tender in unlimited amounts. Twenty pence pieces and fifty pence pieces are legal tender in amounts up to 10 pounds; five pence pieces and ten pence pieces are legal tender in amounts up to 5 pounds; and pennies and two pence coins are legal tender in amounts up to 20 pence. In accordance with the Coinage Act 1971, gold sovereigns are also legal tender for any amount. Although it is not specifically mentioned on them, the face values of gold coins are 50p; ¬£1; ¬£2; and ¬£5, a mere fraction of their worth as bullion. Five pound coins, although legal tender, are intended as souvenirs and are almost never seen in circulation. To meet the legal definition of legal tender, the exact amount due must be tendered; no change can be demanded.https://www.royalmint.com/help/trm-faqs/legal-tender-amounts/ Maundy money is legal tender but may not be accepted by retailers and is worth much more than face value due to its rarity value and silver content. Bank of England notes are legal tender in England and Wales and are issued in the denominations of ¬£5, ¬£10, ¬£20 and ¬£50. They can always be redeemed at the Bank of England even if discontinued. Banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks are not legal tender anywhere but are widely accepted with agreement between parties. In a 1976 case, Miliangos v George Frank Ltd, the House of Lords established that the English courts could order debts to be paid in currencies other than sterling under certain circumstances, overturning two centuries of precedent. =United States= Before the Civil War (1861 to 1865), silver coins were legal tender only up to the sum of $5. Before 1853, when U.S. silver coins were reduced in weight 7%, coins had exactly their value in metal (from 1830 to 1852). Two silver 50 cent coins had exactly $1 worth of silver. A gold U.S. dollar of 1849 had $1 worth of gold. With the flood of gold coming out of the California mines in the early 1850s, the price of silver rose (gold went down). Thus, 50 cent coins of 1840 to 1852 were worth 53 cents if melted down. The government could increase the value of the gold coins (expensive) or reduce the size of all U.S. silver coins. With the reduction of 1853, a 50-cent coin now had only 48 cents of silver. This is the reason for the $5 limit of silver coins as legal tender; paying somebody $100 in the new silver coins would be giving them $96 worth of silver. Most people preferred bank check or gold coins for large purchases. During the early American Civil War, the federal government first issued United States Notes (the first greenback notes), which were not redeemable in gold and silver coins but could be used to pay \\"all dues\\" to the federal government. Since land purchases and duties on imports were payable only in gold or the new Demand Notes, the Demand Notes were bought by importers and land speculators for about 97 cents on the gold dollar and never lost value. 1862 greenbacks (Legal Tender Notes) at first traded for 97 cents on the dollar but gained/lost value depending on fortunes of the Union army. The value of Legal Tender Greenbacks swung wildly but trading was from 85 to 33 cents on the gold dollar. This resulted in a situation in which the greenback \\"Legal Tender\\" notes of 1862 were fiat, and so gold and silver were held and paper circulated at a discount because of Gresham's law. The 1861 Demand Notes were a huge success but robbed the customs house of much needed gold coin (interest on most bonds back then was paid in gold). A money-strapped Congress, which had to pay for the war, eventually adopted the Legal Tender Act of 1862, issuing United States Notes backed only by treasury securities, and compelled the people to accept the new notes at a discount; prices rose except for those who had gold and/or silver coins. Following the Civil War, paper currency was disputed as to whether it must be accepted as payment. In 1869, Hepburn v. Griswold found that Henry Griswold would not have to accept paper currency because it could not truly be \\"legal tender\\" and was unconstitutional as a legally enforceable means to pay debts. This led to the Legal Tender Cases in 1870, which overturned the previous ruling and established the paper currency as constitutional and proper legal tender that must be accepted in all situations.Hammond, Bray. Banks and Politics in America. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991. pp. 108‚Äì109 With the 1884 Supreme Court ruling in Juilliard v. Greenman, the \\"Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the right to issue notes to be legal tender for the payment of public and private debt. Legal-tender notes are treasury notes or banknotes that, in the eyes of the law, must be accepted in the payment of debts.\\"Allen, Larry. The Encyclopedia of Money. Santa Barbara: ABC CLIO, 2009. pp. 250‚Äì251 The ruling in the Legal Tender Cases (which include Juilliard v. Greenman) led later courts to \\"support the federal government's invalidation of gold clauses in private contracts in the 1930s.\\"Zywicki, Todd. \\"Article I, Section 8\\" in The Heritage Guide to the Constitution. Regnery Publishing, 2014. p. 147 On the other hand, coins made of gold or silver may not necessarily be legal tender, if they are not fiat money in the jurisdiction where they are proffered as payment. The Coinage Act of 1965 states (in part): Contrary to common misconception, there is no federal law stating that a private business, a person, or a government organization must accept currency or coins for payment. Private businesses are free to create their own policies on whether they accept cash, unless there is a specific state law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in cents or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores, and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency as a matter of policy or safety. The principal purpose of that statute is to ensure the nationwide acceptance of U.S. currency, consistent with constitutional language that reserves to Congress the power to create a uniform currency that holds the same value throughout the United States. While the statute provides that U.S. money is legal tender that may be accepted for the payment of debts, it does not require acceptance of cash payments, nor does it provide that restrictions cannot be imposed upon the acceptance of cash. =Venezuela= On 11 December 2016, the Venezuelan Government announced demonetisation following almost 500% inflation in the country. People of the country were given 3 days to get rid of the 100 Bolivar notes (most widely used currency) post the introduction of new note of higher denominations. As of 15 June 2017, there has been 7 extensions (one per month) of the legal use of the 100 bolivares bill notes. The 100 Bolivar notes were still legal tender as of 30 December 2017.

The most common form of systematic sampling is an equiprobability method. In this approach, progression through the list is treated circularly, with a return to the top once the end of the list is passed. The sampling starts by selecting an element from the list at random and then every kth element in the frame is selected, where k, is the sampling interval (sometimes known as the skip): this is calculated as: :k = \\\\frac Nn where n is the sample size, and N is the population size. Using this procedure each element in the population has a known and equal probability of selection. This makes systematic sampling functionally similar to simple random sampling (SRS). However it is not the same as SRS because not every possible sample of a certain size has an equal chance of being chosen (e.g. samples with at least two elements adjacent to each other will never be chosen by systematic sampling). It is however, much more efficient (if variance within systematic sample is more than variance of population). Systematic sampling is to be applied only if the given population is logically homogeneous, because systematic sample units are uniformly distributed over the population. The researcher must ensure that the chosen sampling interval does not hide a pattern. Any pattern would threaten randomness. Example: Suppose a supermarket wants to study buying habits of their customers, then using systematic sampling they can choose every 10th or 15th customer entering the supermarket and conduct the study on this sample. This is random sampling with a system. From the sampling frame, a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter are at regular intervals. For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses. 120/8=15, so every 15th house is chosen after a random starting point between 1 and 15. If the random starting point is 11, then the houses selected are 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116. As an aside, if every 15th house was a \\"corner house\\" then this corner pattern could destroy the randomness of the sample. If, as more frequently, the population is not evenly divisible (suppose you want to sample 8 houses out of 125, where 125/8=15.625), should you take every 15th house or every 16th house? If you take every 16th house, 8*16=128, so there is a risk that the last house chosen does not exist. On the other hand, if you take every 15th house, 8*15=120, so the last five houses will never be selected. The random starting point should instead be selected as a non integer between 0 and 15.625 (inclusive on one endpoint only) to ensure that every house has equal chance of being selected; the interval should now be non integral (15.625); and each non integer selected should be rounded up to the next integer. If the random starting point is 3.6, then the houses selected are 4, 20, 35, 50, 66, 82, 98, and 113, where there are 3 cyclic intervals of 15 and 4 intervals of 16. To illustrate the danger of systematic skip concealing a pattern, suppose we were to sample a planned neighborhood where each street has ten houses on each block. This places houses No. 1, 10, 11, 20, 21, 30... on block corners; corner blocks may be less valuable, since more of their area is taken up by street front etc. that is unavailable for building purposes. If we then sample every 10th household, our sample will either be made up only of corner houses (if we start at 1 or 10) or have no corner houses (any other start); either way, it will not be representative. Systematic sampling may also be used with non-equal selection probabilities. In this case, rather than simply counting through elements of the population and selecting every kth unit, we allocate each element a space along a number line according to its selection probability. We then generate a random start from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and move along the number line in steps of 1. Example: We have a population of 5 units (A to E). We want to give unit A a 20% probability of selection, unit B a 40% probability, and so on up to unit E (100%). Assuming we maintain alphabetical order, we allocate each unit to the following interval: A: 0 to 0.2 B: 0.2 to 0.6 (= 0.2 + 0.4) C: 0.6 to 1.2 (= 0.6 + 0.6) D: 1.2 to 2.0 (= 1.2 + 0.8) E: 2.0 to 3.0 (= 2.0 + 1.0) If our random start was 0.156, we would first select the unit whose interval contains this number (i.e. A). Next, we would select the interval containing 1.156 (element C), then 2.156 (element E). If instead our random start was 0.350, we would select from points 0.350 (B), 1.350 (D), and 2.350 (E).

A pioneer of audiovisually elaborate text adventure games, it was one of the two largest and most acclaimed interactive fiction developers of the 1980s. History =Formation= Formed by Anita Sinclair, Ken Gordon and Hugh Steers in 1984, London-based Magnetic Scrolls initially dabbled with development on the Sinclair QL home computer before deciding to take advantage of the emerging Atari ST and Amiga gaming platforms. Having secured a publication deal with Rainbird, a British software label owned by Telecomsoft, they began work producing an ambitious text adventure game that would become The Pawn. During the mid-1980s, the text adventure market was thriving, although only a very few developers exclusively specialised in the genre. The undisputed giants of the genre were Infocom, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who practically redefined the genre by ensuring the interface (or text parser) never provided a barrier between the player and the fictional elements of the game. Infocom's dominance of the text adventure market ensured they had very few rivals in the United States. Adventure International, owned by Scott and Lexis Adams, had been an early competitor of Infocom, but they went out of business long before Infocom had hit their stride. Their only other serious competitor was Sierra On-Line, owned by Ken and Roberta Williams, who specialised in graphical adventure games. During the early to mid-1980s Level 9 Computing dominated the UK text adventure market. Delta 4 and CRL also produced a number of text adventures that were critical and commercial hits but were never a serious rival to Level 9. Until they were acquired by Activision in 1985, Infocom's titles were something of a rarity in the UK, only usually available as expensive imports. Magnetic Scrolls immediately took advantage of this considerable gap in the UK market with their first release, The Pawn. =Early releases= The Pawn, written by Rob Steggles, was released in 1985, on a wide range of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms, to considerable acclaim. One of the game's biggest selling points, besides the advanced text parser, engrossing story and exquisite packaging, were the high resolution illustrations that accompanied many of the game's locations. Although decidedly antiquated by today's standards, at the time they were considered state-of-the-art. The ZX Spectrum version of the game did not include graphics. In 1987, Magnetic Scrolls released two new games. Steggles returned to write The Guild of Thieves, a traditional treasure hunt, while Georgina Sinclair and Michael Bywater wrote the contemporary fantasy of Jinxter. Both games met with similar critical acclaim as The Pawn. For their next release, Corruption (1988), Magnetic Scrolls decided to experiment with the boundaries of interactive fiction. Once again written by Rob Steggles, with the help of Hugh Steers, the game was a contemporary thriller that explored corporate corruption and greed. Corruption abandoned the traditional puzzle-solving, treasure-hunting gameplay of many text adventure games, requiring the player to progress by conversing with characters, collecting evidence and working against the clock in order to beat the game. The game came packaged with a cassette tape containing a series of audio conversations. The player would be prompted to play them at specific points during the story, adding an extra layer of depth to the game. Released towards the end of 1988 was Fish!, a more light-hearted, surreal adventure game, where the player assumed the role of a dimension-jumping goldfish. Written by John Molloy, Pete Kemp, Phil South and edited by Rob Steggles, Fish! would prove to be the last of Magnetic Scrolls' traditional commercial releases. Myth was released in 1989 through Official Secrets, an adventure gaming club set up by Tony Rainbird after he (and Magnetic Scrolls) parted ways with Telecomsoft. Now based in Hertfordshire, Magnetic Scrolls produced this mini-adventure as a freebie that would be given away to those who signed up to join Official Secrets. The gaming club didn't last long, however, and was quickly assimilated into Tony Rainbird's new Special Reserve company, specialising in mail order computer hardware and software. =Later years and demise= Wonderland had been in development at Magnetic Scrolls for some time and was finally released by Virgin Mastertronic in 1990. Magnetic Scrolls had devised a brand new interface, christened Magnetic Windows, to take advantage of the Amiga and Atari ST's advanced capabilities. Incorporating auto-mapping, icons, help functions and separate, resizable windows for graphics and text, Wonderland, written by David Bishop and based on the works of Lewis Carroll, was a deliberate attempt to push the text adventure in a new, hi-tech direction. Magnetic Scrolls certainly succeeded in all their objectives, but the traditional text-based genre had already begun to die out as gamers craved more visually elaborate gaming experiences. In 1988, Magnetic Scrolls began to collaborate with Infocom, Douglas Adams and Michael Bywater on a sequel to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This project was never finished. A playable draft of an early part of the game, along with the personal and commercial circumstances behind its ill-fated development, came briefly to public attention twenty years later. In 1991, Virgin Interactive released The Magnetic Scrolls Collection Vol 1, containing new versions of The Guild of Thieves, Corruption and Fish! that took advantage of the Magnetic Windows engine. A second collection, containing their remaining games, was planned but never completed. As a consequence of the dying text adventure market, Magnetic Scrolls ceased publishing in 1992. They were acquired by MicroProse later that year. A number of Magnetic Scrolls' staff went on to help develop a 3D role- playing video game entitled The Legacy: Realm of Terror, which was released on the PC to lukewarm reviews, but MicroProse did not capitalise on the Magnetic Scrolls name beyond that. In the late 1990s, Ken Gordon registered the magneticscrolls.com domain, which now redirects to the Strand Games website. Two programmers from Magnetic Scrolls, Doug Rabson and Servan Keondjian later formed the company RenderMorphics which produced the highly acclaimed 3D Graphics API Reality Lab. In January 1995 another Magnetic Scrolls programmer, Steve Lacey joined RenderMorphics and in February of the same year Microsoft acquired the company. Reality Lab became the basis for Direct3D. Rabson and Keondjian are now at Qube Software, which they co-founded with Hugh Steers. Lacey remained at Microsoft as the graphics engine lead on Microsoft Flight Simulator. In October 2006, Lacey moved to Google. In 2011, he was killed in a car accident.https://www.geekwire.com/2011/google-engineer-steve-lacey-victim- car-wreck-kirkland/ John Molloy moved to Florida, US, working on web-based applications, and died in 2018 following an illness. Phil South lives in Somerset, UK, and works at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Anita Sinclair is now one of the UK's most successful Bridge players, winning a number of domestic competitions, and winning a gold medal in China. = Reappearance = In May 2017 the Strand Games initiative emerged. Strand Games was started by Hugh Steers -- co-founder and core developer of Magnetic Scrolls -- and Stefan Meier of the Magnetic Scrolls Memorial fanpage. It is supported by several members of the original Magnetic Scrolls team, including Anita Sinclair, Ken Gordon, Rob Steggles and Servan Keondjian. The non-profit initiative aims both to preserve the original works of Magnetic Scrolls and to remaster the games for modern devices. With the public appearance of the initiative a first beta version of the remastered classic The Pawn was released. The official release followed in June 2017. In June 2017 Magnetic Scrolls worked on recovering the source code of their classics from tapes to remaster and re-release them.Dev rescues '80s text adventure source code by baking tapes in an oven on Gamasutra.com By Alex Wawro (June 28, 2017) After the successful recovery of the original source codes in a remarkable process, which involved baking the original backup tapes at low temperature in a kitchen oven, the initiative started to remaster The Guild of Thieves from the original source codes. In December 2017 the remastered and enhanced game was published. This was followed by a similarly revived edition of Jinxter in 2019.

Early life Clarke grew up in Navan, County Meath, Ireland. He was educated at Dundalk Grammar School and while there, he came first twice in the Senior Chemical, Physical, and Mathematical section of the Young Scientist Exhibition. The first time, in 1993, was with a project entitled \\"The C Neural Network Construction Kit\\". The second time, the following year, was with a project entitled \\"Mapping Internal Variations in Translucency within a Translucent Object using Beams of Light\\". Freenet In 1995, Clarke left Dundalk to study Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. While at Edinburgh, he became president of the then dormant Artificial Intelligence Society, resulting in its revival. In Clarke's final year at Edinburgh, he completed his final year project, entitled \\"A Distributed, Decentralised Information Storage and Retrieval System\\". In July 1999, after receiving a 'B' grade for his paper, he decided to release it to the Internet and invited volunteers to help implement his design. The resulting free software project became known as Freenet, and attracted significant attention from the mainstream and technology media. In August 1999, Clarke began his first full-time job as a software developer in the Space Division of Logica plc, a London-based software consulting company. In February 2000, he left Logica to join a small software start-up called Instil Ltd. In August 2000, he left London for Santa Monica, California, where he co-founded Uprizer, Inc. with the intent of commercializing some of his Freenet-related ideas. In January 2001, Uprizer Inc. successfully raised $4 million in Series A round venture funding from investors including Intel Capital. In March 2001, Clarke published an article describing FairShare, developed in collaboration with Uprizer's co-founders, Steven Starr and Rob Kramer. Clarke was concerned that copyright would become increasingly difficult to enforce in the Internet age, the goal of Fairshare was to provide an alternative to copyright as a way to compensate creators. Professional career In September 2002, after leaving Uprizer, Clarke formed Cematics LLC to explore a variety of new ideas and opportunities. Cematics LLC developed a number of products including Locutus- a P2P search application for the Enterprise, WhittleBit - a search engine that learns from user Feedback, and 3D17, a web-based collaborative editing tool. In October 2003, Clarke decided to leave the United States to return to Edinburgh, Scotland. In December 2004, he began work on Dijjer, a distributed P2P web cache, and Indy, a collaborative music discovery system, both in conjunction with ChangeTv, a company founded by his long-time collaborator, Steven Starr, who later brought in Clarke and Oliver Luckett as co-founders. In 2003, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35. ChangeTv changed its name to Revver Inc. and unveiled a new website in November 2005 that strove to let creators of short videos earn revenue from their work. Revver was one of several user-created video websites unveiled in late 2005, but was the first such website to financially compensate video creators, and is reminiscent of Fairshare. In December 2006, Clarke left Revver and moved to Austin, Texas. There, Clarke founded a new company, SenseArray, which is a drop-in ad targeting engine based on a proprietary algorithm developed by Clarke. In October 2009, he released Swarm, a novel approach to distributing computation across multiple computers in a manner largely transparent to the programmer. In January 2012, Clarke co- founded OneSpot, with the goal of creating \\"ads that don't suck\\". Over the next 3 years, he designed a real-time bidding engine capable of consistently outperforming Google Adwords. In March 2012, he open sourced LastCalc, an online calculator he intended to provide an open and more flexible alternative to tools like Google Calculator.

His major recordings were \\"Skyliner\\", \\"Cherokee\\", \\"The Wrong Idea\\", \\"Scotch and Soda\\", \\"In a Mizz\\", and \\"Southland Shuffle\\". Early life Barnet was born in New York City. His parents divorced when he was two, and he was raised by his mother and her grandparents. His grandfather was Charles Frederick Daly, a vice-president for the New York Central Railroad, banker, and businessman. Barnet attended various boarding schools, both in the New York and Chicago areas. He learned to play piano and saxophone as a child. He often left school to listen to music and to try to gain work as a musician. Although his family wanted him to become a lawyer, he chose to be a musician instead. Career By sixteen, Barnet had done road work with a Jean Goldkette satellite band and was in New York, where he joined Frank Winegar's Pennsylvania Boys on tenor sax. Always restless, by 1931 he had relocated to Hollywood and appeared as a film extra while trying to interest local bandleaders in hot music, which was increasingly unpopular due to the Great Depression. Late in 1932, he returned east and persuaded a contact at CBS' artist bureau to try him out as an orchestra leader. He was 18 years old. Barnet began recording in October 1933, during an engagement at New York's Park Central Hotel, but was not a great success for most of the 1930s, regularly breaking up his band and changing its style. Early in 1935 he attempted to premiere swing music at New Orleans' Hotel Roosevelt, where Louisiana's colorful Governor Huey Long, disliking the new sound, had the band run out of town by luring them to a bordello, which was then raided. Barnet arranged with Joe Haymes to take several of his now- jobless sidemen, while he himself went on a lark in Havana, as an escort to well-to-do older women. 1936 saw another swinging Barnet edition, which featured the up-and-coming vocal quartet The Modernaires but quickly faded from the scene. The height of Barnet's popularity‚Äîand his first truly permanent band‚Äîcame between 1939 and 1941, a period that began with his hit version of \\"Cherokee\\", written by Ray Noble and arranged by Billy May. In 1944, Barnet had another big hit with \\"Skyliner\\". In 1947, he started to switch from swing music to bebop. During his swing period his band included Buddy DeFranco, Roy Eldridge, Neal Hefti, Lena Horne, Barney Kessel, Dodo Marmorosa, Oscar Pettiford, and Art House, while later versions of the band included Maynard Ferguson, Doc Severinsen, Jimmy Knepper and Clark Terry. Trumpeter Billy May was an arranger in the Charlie Barnet Orchestra before joining Glenn Miller in 1940. He was one of the first bandleaders to integrate his band; the year is variously given as 1935 or 1937. He was an outspoken admirer of Count Basie and Duke Ellington. Ellington recorded the Charlie Barnet composition \\"In a Mizz\\". In 1939, Basie lent Barnet his charts after Barnets' had been destroyed in a fire at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles. Throughout his career he was an opponent of syrupy arrangements. In the song \\"The Wrong Idea\\", he lampooned the \\"sweet\\" big band sound of the era. The song was written by Billy May, who later used the same satirical bent in his collaborations with Stan Freberg on Capitol Records including the Lawrence Welk satire \\"Wunnerful! Wunnerful!\\" Barnet's was a notorious party band where drinking and vandalism were not uncommon. While Glenn Miller enforced strict standards of dress and deportment, Barnet was more interested in having fun, according to his autobiography The Swinging Years. In 1949 he retired, apparently because he had lost interest in music. He was able to retire when he chose because he was one of the few heirs in a very wealthy family. He occasionally returned from retirement for brief tours but never returned to music full-time. In 1956, he released an album, Dance Bash, which was recorded over five years from 1947 to 1952. Known for a unique sound and hard-swinging style on tenor saxophone, Barnet in the late 1930s added the alto saxophone to his arsenal, followed by the soprano saxophone, an instrument that had fallen out of favor after the 1920s and was not generally used in the big band era. In September 1964, Barnet arranged a private party for his musical hero, Duke Ellington, and orchestra to play at Palm Springs' San Jacinto country club. At the door, a small sign painted by Barnet said: \\"Any complaints about loud music or requests for excessive use of mutes will be grounds for instant expulsion (to a table in the parking lot). Any requests for folk music, twist, watusi, or rock and roll will result in instant execution by golf balls at 20 paces.\\"Leonard Feather, Down Beat magazine; Duke's diary, Ken Vail, vol. 2, p. 252. Barnet did not play at the gathering. Theme Barnet's theme song was \\"Redskin Rhumba\\".  Personal life  Barnet was married eleven times and in his 1984 autobiography says, \\"I went through several more marital fiascos, but they were mostly Mexican marriages and quickly annulled, because they weren't legal in the first place.\\" His final marriage to Betty Thompson was for 33 years. He had one son, Charles D. Barnet, Jr, and two grandchildren Jennifer Ann Barnet and Darren Charles Barnet from an earlier marriage. During retirement, Barnet resided at homes in Palm Springs and San Diego, California. He kept a 46-foot boat in San Diego.  Death  Barnet died from complications of Alzheimer's disease and pneumonia at San Diego's Hillside hospital, on September 4, 1991. Compositions Charlie Barnet's compositions included \\"Skyliner\\", \\"Southland Shuffle\\", \\"Swing Street Strut\\", \\"The Right Idea\\", \\"The Wrong Idea\\" with Billy May, \\"Growlin'\\", \\"Scotch and Soda\\", \\"Midweek Function\\", \\"Oh What You Said (Are We Burnt Up?)\\", \\"I Kinda Like You\\", \\"Tappin' at the Tappa\\", \\"The Last Jump\\", \\"Knocking at the Famous Door\\", \\"Lazy Bug\\" with Juan Tizol, \\"Ogoun Badagris (Voodoo War God)\\", and \\"In a Mizz\\", which was recorded by Duke Ellington. \\"Skyliner\\", arranged by Billy May, was written as the theme music for the late 1940s US Armed Forces Network program \\"Midnight In Munich\\",Themes of the Big Bands Vol.2 - liner notes broadcast from the AFN station in Munich, Germany, and hosted by Ralph Moffat. Thanks to the station's immensely powerful twin 100 kW transmitters, AFN Munich could be heard as far away as the UK; this, and the popularity of Moffat's show, evidently helped \\"Skyliner\\" and many other contemporary American swing hits to gain wide popularity across Europe and become hits in the UK.Billboard, Feb. 14 1948, p.38 The title (which was originally printed as \\"Sky Liner\\") may be a reference to the practice of American pilots flying into Munich who used the radio station's powerful signal to home in on the city.

In the UK, they are generally called 'public information films' (PIFs); in Hong Kong, they are known as 'announcements in the public interest' ('APIs'). History The earliest public service announcements (in the form of moving pictures) were made before and during the Second World War years in both the UK and the US. In the UK, amateur actor Richard Massingham set up Public Relationship Films Ltd in 1938 as a specialist agency for producing short educational films for the public. In the films, he typically played a bumbling character who was slightly more stupid than average and often explained the message of the film by demonstrating the risks if it was ignored. The films covered topics such as how to cross the road, how to prevent the spread of diseases, how to swim, and how to drive without causing the road to be unsafe for other users. During the war, he was commissioned by the Ministry of Information to produce films for the war effort. Massingham began to produce longer films, for both private companies and the Government, after the War. In the US, the Ad Council (initially called the War Advertising Council) was set up in 1941, when America entered World War II. It began implementing on a massive scale the idea of using advertising to influence American society on a range of fronts. Its first campaigns focused on the country's needs during World War II, such as encouraging the American public to invest their savings in government bonds. After the war, PSAs were used to educate the public on a broader range of important issues. In the UK, they were produced for the Central Office of Information (COI), and again by private contractors, which were usually small film companies, such as Richard Taylor Cartoons. They were supplied to broadcasters free of charge for them to use whenever they wished. Their usefulness as a cost-free means to fill the gaps in fixed-duration commercial breaks left by unsold advertising airtime led to their being used regularly and extensively in the 60s, 70s, and much of the 80s, and consequently, within both the COI and broadcasting companies, they were typically known as \\"fillers\\". They are still being produced, although the vastly reduced need for broadcasters to turn to third-party filler material to deal with unused airtime during breaks or junctions means they are now only seen rarely. Topics =USA= The most common topics of PSAs are health and safety, such as the multimedia Emergency Preparedness & Safety Tips On Air and Online (talk radio/blog) campaign. A typical PSA is part of a public awareness campaign to inform or educate the public about an issue such as obesity or compulsive gambling. The range of possible topics has expanded over time. From time to time a charitable organization enlists the support of a celebrity for a PSA; examples include actress Kathryn Erbe telling people to be green and Crips gang leader Stanley Williams speaking from prison to urge youth not to join gangs. Some PSAs tell people to adopt animals instead of buying them. Protecting our Earth, also known as being green, is another example of a current PSA topic. Some television shows featuring very special episodes made PSAs after the episodes. For example, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit talked about child abduction in one episode, so it had a PSA about child abduction. Another example is when the original Law & Order did an episode about drunk driving, which had a PSA about drunk driving. One of the earliest television public service announcements came in the form of Smokey Bear. During the 1980s, many American cartoon shows contained PSAs at the end of their shows. These may or may not have been relevant to the episode itself. Three of the most widely known are the closing moral segments at the end of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, the \\"Knowing is Half the Battle\\" epilogues in G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and the \\"Sonic Says\\" segments from Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. Some television PSAs have topics such as on not watching so much television, or not taking fictional stories literally; or about television, movie, or video game ratings. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, environmental‚Äìpolitical issues became popular, such as the Turtle Tips or Planeteer Alert. The English dub of Sailor Moon also has the PSA closing segments at the end of each episode called \\"Sailor Says\\" (known as \\"Sailor Moon Says\\") in two seasons only. =In other countries= China's first PSAs in 1986 were about saving water and were broadcast on Guiyang television. In Hong Kong, terrestrial television networks have been required since National Day 2004 to preface their main evening news broadcasts with a minute-long announcement in the public interest which plays the Chinese National Anthem in Mandarin over various patriotic montages.Vickers, Edward. \\"Learning to Love the Motherland: 'National Education' in Post-Retrocession Hong Kong\\" in Designing History in East Asian Textbooks: Identity Politics and Transnational Aspirations, p. 94\\\\.
