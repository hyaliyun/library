He was an All-American at DePaul University and the first player in school history to win a conference player of the year award. High school Kleinschmidt led Chicago's Gordon Tech to a runner-up finish in the 1990 Illinois High School Association's boys basketball tournament. While losing to Chicago King, 65 - 55, Kleinschmidt, as a junior, scored 27 of the 55 points. During the entire tournament that included four games, he totaled 125 points (31.25 ppg), 38 rebounds (9.5 rpg), 15 assists (3.75 apg), 14 steals (3.5 spg) and 7 blocked shots (1.75 bpg).IHSA Summaries In 2006, Kleinschmidt was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament.

The series ran from early 1996 until June 16, 2001. In 2003, \\"B.G.\\" (full name undisclosed) was convicted for copyright infringements related to the Twilight series, as well as associated violence relating to the discs' production. The court estimated he had earned approximately 1,678,215 Euro with the series in question as well as others. The series was originally distributed from out of the Netherlands, but later appeared in many European countries as well. In 2012, an independently operated website called twilight-cd.com began cataloging the history of the Twilight discs.  History  During the period when the series began, CD writers and recordable CDs were still rare and expensive, while the internet was not yet mature for large file transfers as Internet users at the time used dial-up or ISDN modems, and file sharing and P2P networks were still small and insignificant. The original Twilight CDs, which were professionally pressed, could be ordered over the internet in addition to being purchased in stores, creating a profitable income for the disc creators. In turn, the discs were copied and resold by people unrelated to the original distribution as well as shared over the Usenet, which drew the ire from the Twilight disc creators, as it created an inverse proportionality between the sales of CD-ROMs and the speeds of the Internet.  Organisation  The Twilight discs were created by an organisation led by two men known as \\"B.G.\\", also known as \\"De Oorbel\\" (Dutch for \\"the Earring\\", a reference to software piracy) from the village of Soest, Netherlands, and \\"M.S.\\", also known as \\"Idi\\". The organisation also produced and distributed other illegal software packages, branded as Crazybytes, as well as music and films, under the Moviebox name. The CD-ROMs were professionally pressed in large quantities. Crazybytes were sold from 1996 and was sold from Enschede, Netherlands by Gerrit D., Gerbert D., Mark B., and Jan W. (last names undisclosed); they were reported to police in 1997, but the person who tipped the authorities were allegedly attacked in 1999; the beatings remain uninvestigated.  Lawsuit and convictions  In 2002 an investigation was started into the source of the Twilight, Crazybytes and Moviebox series. The official estimation of the Dutch attorney general was that in total around 400,000 copies were pressed and sold. The price of a single release was between 20 and 40 Euro. In 2003 \\"B.G.\\", \\"M.S.\\" and an unnamed party were convicted for physical assault and sentenced five years in prison for kidnapping, assault and extortion of a previous member of their organisation, \\"Flappie\\" and his friend, who had tried to start a rival warez distribution network. In another trial that year, \\"B.G.\\" was convicted for copyright infringement and constituting \\"a major disruption of public order\\". He as well as the general attorney appealed. In 2007 he was finally convicted. It was established that he had to refund 90% of the estimated profits, around 1,5 million Euro. Consequently, three students were convicted for copyright infringements and participation in a criminal organisation by illegally downloading programs using fast university networks to which they had access, as well as breaking the protections of the applications. They were given suspended sentences as well as fines of around 10,000 Euro.

Wrone (born May 15, 1933) is an American academic, author and historian. He is a professor emeritus of history at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and a specialist in the fields of Native American history and political assassinations, writing books and articles on the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. Biography A native of Clinton, Illinois, Wrone graduated from Clinton High School in 1951. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, earning his bachelor's degree and doctorate in American history. He was a history professor for 35 years at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and has been professor emeritus since retiring in 1993. UW-Stevens Point honored Wrone with the \\"Excellence in Teaching Award\\" for 1969-1970 and the \\"Scholar Award\\" for 1993-1994. Wrone is on the board of directors of the Assassination Archives and Research Center, an organization founded in 1984 to research and compile records related to political assassinations. Career =Native American history= In the course of his academic career, Wrone lectured, researched and wrote about Native American tribes. His research includes the treaty rights of the U.S.-Native American treaties, and on the Menominee nation and Stockbridge-Munsee Community of Wisconsin. In 1973, he authored the book, Who's The Savage? A Documentary History of the Mistreatment of the Native North Americans. At UW-Stevens Point, Wrone helped introduce Menominee language courses, the first instruction of the language at any university. =Study of JFK assassination= Wrone has devoted more than 40 years to researching the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He is a frequent author of book reviews on the assassination, and edited The Legal Proceedings of Harold Weisberg v. General Services Administration (1975), the court record on the lawsuit to obtain the executive session transcripts of the Warren Commission from January 20, 1964 and January 27, 1964. Wrone sued the United States government for records of Abraham Zapruder's 26-second film of Kennedy's assassination, in particular records relating to its acquisition and purchase. Wrone taught a course in the subject at UW-Stevens Point, and in 1993 published the book, The Zapruder Film: Reframing JFK's Assassination, an in- depth analysis of the film. According to Wrone, the film proves that there was more than one gunman firing at Kennedy's motorcade. He is a frequent critic of the Warren Commission and its subsequent report, which he believes was padded with useless information. Wrone said in 2013, ‚ÄúWhen you go through those 912 pages, you'll find that it tells you Lee Harvey Oswald in 1941 had a dog called 'Sunshine' and that his aunt worked in 1929 in Woolworths dime store in New Orleans. It also tells you that John Quincy Adams, President of the United States, liked to skinny dip in the Potomac River, and that President Chet Arthur liked to ride the streetcars. It also tells you many other interesting things that had no relationship whatsoever to the murder of President John F. Kennedy.‚Äù Wrone has commented on Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK by stating: \\"The film fails on logic, fails on fact.\\" He described Stone's premise of a conspiracy involving the Central Intelligence Agency and a so-called military- industrial complex as \\"irrational\\". According to Wrone, other assassination films, including Executive Action and Interview with the Assassin, are \\"the commercial exploitation of a great tragedy\\". Regarding the latter film, he said: \\"The facts in Interview with the Assassin were so egregiously in error, I had to stop watching it.\\" He is one of several academic critics of Gerald Posner's well-known JFK assassination book Case Closed (1993), which Wrone blames for \\"massive numbers of factual errors\\" as well as off-base speculation.Journal of Southern History (February 1995), cited in: James H. Fetzer, Murder in Dealey Plaza, Chapter \\"The Silence of the Historians\\" by Fetzer, Catfeet Press, Chicago, 2000,p. 375. He also criticized pundit Bill O'Reilly's 2012 book, Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot, calling it \\"one atrocious book.\\" =The Zapruder Film= Wrone's 2003 book, The Zapruder Film: Reframing JFK's Assassination, provides a frame-by-frame analysis of Abraham Zapruder's 26-second film of Kennedy's assassination and various aspects of the film's history. The book also outlines Wrone's argument that shots were fired at Kennedy from three different angles, with none of them originating from Lee Harvey Oswald's position on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Addressing the issue that some believe the film to be a forgery, Michael L. Kurtz wrote that \\"...Wrone's lengthy and exhaustive study of the history of the Zapruder film argues persuasively for its authenticity.\\" Reviewing the book for CNN, L.D. Meagher wrote: \\"Wrone writes carefully, building his analysis brick by brick. His prose is academic, which may be off- putting to the casual reader. But his research is quite thorough and his conclusions are compelling.\\" A review in Publishers Weekly stated: \\"While Wrone's exhaustive consideration of the film itself quickly becomes tedious, he provides a few chapters that tell some intriguing stories\\" and \\"[a]side from these anecdotes, however, there is nothing new here, just reiteration of the scathing criticisms of the Warren Commission's conclusions.\\" According to Kermit L. Hall: \\"The book treats what might be thought the perfect piece of evidence with far too much authority. What the Zapruder footage shows is that a man was killed before our eyes, but Wrone's efforts to determine the origin of the shots is, in the end, frustrating and ultimately problematical.\\" Selected publications * Who's The Savage?

This condition is quantitively expressed by the inequality : \\\\eta^2 (2n+1) \\\\ll 1, where \\\\eta is the Lamb-Dicke parameter and n is the motional quantum number of the ion or atom's harmonic oscillator state.  Relation between Lamb Dicke parameter and Lamb Dicke regime  Considering the ion's motion along the direction of the static trapping potential of an ion trap (the axial motion in z-direction), the trap potential can be validly approximated as quadratic around the equilibrium position and the ion's motion locally be considered as that of a quantum harmonic oscillator with quantum harmonic oscillator eigenstates n\\\\rangle. In this case the position operator \\\\hat{z} is given by : \\\\hat{z} = z_0 (\\\\hat{a} + \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger). where :z_0 = (\\\\langle 0\\\\vert z^2 \\\\vert 0\\\\rangle)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} = (\\\\hbar/2m\\\\omega_z)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} is the spread of the zero-point wavefunction, \\\\omega_z is the frequency of the static harmonic trapping potential in z-direction and \\\\hat{a},\\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger are the ladder operators of the harmonic oscillator. The Lamb Dicke regime corresponds to the condition : \\\\langle\\\\Psi_{motion}\\\\vert {k_z}^2 z^2 \\\\vert \\\\Psi_{motion} \\\\rangle^{1/2} \\\\ll 1 where \\\\langle\\\\Psi_{motion}\\\\vert is the motional part of the ion's wavefunction and k_z = \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot \\\\hat{z} = \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cos\\\\theta = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}\\\\cos\\\\theta is the projection of the wavevector of the light field acting on the ion on the z-direction. The Lamb-Dicke parameter actually is defined as : \\\\eta = k_z z_0. Upon absorption or emission of a photon with momentum \\\\hbar k_z the kinetic energy of the ion is changed by the amount of the recoil energy E_R = \\\\hbar \\\\omega_R where the definition of the recoil frequency is : \\\\omega_R = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar k_z^2}{2 m}. The square of the Lamb Dicke parameter then is given by : \\\\eta^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\omega_R}{\\\\omega_z} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{change\\\\, in\\\\, kinetic\\\\, energy}}{\\\\mathrm{quantized\\\\, energy\\\\, spacing\\\\, of\\\\, HO}}. Hence the Lamb Dicke parameter \\\\eta quantifies the coupling strength between internal states and motional states of an ion. If the Lamb Dicke parameter is much smaller than one, the quantized energy spacing of the harmonic oscillator is larger than the recoil energy and transitions changing the motional state of the ion are negligible. The Lamb Dicke parameter being small is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the Lamb Dicke regime.  Mathematical background  In ion trapping experiments, laser fields are used to couple the internal state of an ion with its motional state. The mechanical recoil of the ion upon absorption or emission of a photon is described by the operators \\\\exp(\\\\pm i k_z z). These operators induce a displacement of the atomic momentum by the quantity \\\\pm\\\\hbar k_z for the absorption (+) or emission (-) of a laser photon. In the basis of harmonic oscillator eigenstates \\\\\\\\{\\\\vert n\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb N_0}, the probability for the transition \\\\vert n\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\\\vert n^\\\\prime\\\\rangle is given by the Franck-Condon coefficients : F_{n\\\\rightarrow n^\\\\prime} = \\\\langle n^\\\\prime \\\\vert \\\\exp(ik_z z) \\\\vert n\\\\rangle = \\\\langle n^\\\\prime \\\\vert \\\\exp(i \\\\eta (\\\\hat{a} + \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger))\\\\vert n\\\\rangle. If the condition for the Lamb-Dicke regime is met, a Taylor expansion is possible, : \\\\exp(i\\\\eta(\\\\hat{a} + \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger)) = 1 + i \\\\eta(\\\\hat{a} + \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger) + O(\\\\eta^2) and it is readily seen that transitions between motional states, which change the motional quantum number n by more than one, are strongly suppressed.  Meaning of Lamb Dicke regime  In the Lamb Dicke regime spontaneous decay occurs predominantly at the frequency of the qubit's internal transition (carrier frequency) and therefore does not affect the ion's motional state most of the time. This is a necessary requirement for resolved sideband cooling to work efficiently. Reaching the Lamb Dicke regime is a requirement for many of the schemes used to perform coherent operations on ions. It therefore establishes the upper limit on the temperature of ions in order for these methods to create entanglement. During manipulations on ions with laser pulses, the ions cannot be laser cooled. They must therefore be initially cooled down to a temperature such that they stay in the Lamb Dicke regime during the entire manipulation process that creates entanglement.

Since his service dates back to 2006, he is in 2019 the dean, or senior member, of the state House. Background Anders graduated in 1979 from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, where he procured a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture and business. In addition to farm equipment sales, he raises cattle and hay. Anders and his wife, the former Nancy Ratcliff, have three daughters, Dr. Bridget Anders Milliken and husband, Dr. Tom Terry Milliken; Dr. Rachel Anders Durel and husband, Dr. Jason Durel, and Emily Cooper Anders. Anders initially won his House seat in a special election held on September 20, 2006, to replace Democrat Bryant Hammett, who resigned to become secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in the administration of Governor Kathleen Blanco. He polled 4,616 (49.2 percent) and defeated two fellow Democrats to fill the fifteen months remaining in Hammett's term. In the regular nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, 2007, Anders, with 8,254 voters (60.75 percent), defeated three intra-party rivals. Anders is chairman of the House Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture, and Rural Development Committee and serves too on the Insurance and Homeland Security committees. He is a member of the Tensas-Concordia Soil and Water Conservation Board, the Concordia Farm Bureau Board, and the State and Rural Agriculture Leadership. He is also a member of Rotary International in Ferriday. In 2010, Anders's voting record was ranked 75 percent by the conservative Louisiana Family Forum and 69 percent by the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. In the 2011 legislative session, Anders voted to make the cigarette tax permanent and to establish a commission to investigate the proposed abolition of the state income tax. Anders won reelection to the House in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 2011. He defeated fellow Democrat Justin \\"Preacher\\" Conner of Ferriday, 9,217 votes (69.4 percent) to 4,060 votes (30.6 percent). Anders endorsed the reelection in 2014 of Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu, who was unseated by the Republican Bill Cassidy. Anders ran unopposed for reelection to the House in the primary election held on October 24, 2015. In August 2018, Anders was placed in ICU because of a sudden life-threatening illness. He was released a few days later. Anders is term-limited in the nonpartisan blanket primary scheduled for October 12, 2019. He had been expected to run for the District 32 seat in the Louisiana State Senate being vacated by the term- limited Republican Neil Riser of Caldwell Parish. Political columnist Sam Hanna, Jr., of the Ouachita Citizen in West Monroe, suggested that Anders would need to switch parties to be competitive in District 32 against a Republican. John Stephens of LaSalle Parish is expected run. Republican State Representative Steve Pylant of Franklin Parish had been expected to seek the Senate seat but is instead retiring from the legislature in January 2020.

The species is solely known from the Early Eocene, Ypresian stage, Coldwater Beds, part of the Princeton Group, in the Quilchena area, Nicola Country, British Columbia, Canada. History and classification Halictus? savenyei is known only from one fossil, the part and counterpart holotype, specimen numbers \\"Q-0424a\\" for the part and \\"Q-0424b\\" for the counterpart respectively. The specimen is composed of a complete female specimen preserved as a compression fossil on small chips of shale, recovered from outcrops of the Coldwater Beds shales in the Quilchena area by Rene Savenye. The type specimen is currently preserved in the Department of Paleobiology collections housed at Simon Fraser University, located in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. H.? savenyei was first studied by Michael S. Engel of the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA and S. Bruce Archibald of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Their 2003 type description of the new species was published in the journal The Canadian Entomologist. Engel and Archibald coined the specific epithet savenyei in honor of the late Rene Savenye who found and donated the fossil. At the time of the species description, Halictus? savenyei was the second-oldest bee body fossil described and the only bee described from Canadian fossil deposits. Description The H.? savenyei type specimen is a fairly well preserved complete adult female preserved with portions of the fore-wings and hind-wings. The specimen is long with the possibility of alteration in length during fossilization. The sections of forewing which are preserved are approximately long and show dark brown to black coloration. The presence of a pygidial plate bordered by setae on the fifth metasomal tergum supports the placement into the Halictidae subfamily Halictinae. Placement into the tribe Halictini is based on the lack of a medial cleft in the fifth tergum.

Biography Earl was the son of portrait painter Ralph Earl and his second wife Ann Whiteside, and thus a member of the prominent Earle family. He was born c. 1785‚Äì1788, probably in New York City, and likely received his early training in portraiture from his father, whose naive style is reflected in the younger Earl's earliest works. He traveled to London in 1809, where he studied for a year with John Trumbull and was advised by Benjamin West, learning perspective, anatomy, and three-dimensional illusion. He remained in England until 1814, living with his maternal grandfather and uncle in Norwich and executing portrait commissions. He then traveled to Paris before returning to the United States in December 1815 with the intention of creating grand-scale history paintings on the European model. As preparation for a planned project depicting the Battle of New Orleans, Earl met General Andrew Jackson and visited him at his Tennessee home, The Hermitage, in January 1817. Earl painted portraits of Jackson and his family, and married Mrs. Jackson's niece Jane CafferyShe was the daughter of Captain John Caffery and Mary Donelson (1751‚Äì1823) a sister of Mrs Jackson on May 19, 1819. She died in childbirth in 1820, as did their son. After his wife's death, Earl became Jackson's close friend and lived with him at The Hermitage.

Following World War II, FV were part of lower tier competition until advancing in 1951 to the Amateurliga Nordbaden (III) where they played only a single season before being sent down on goal difference. They won their way back to the Amateurliga in 1954, where they spent five seasons. FV again returned to the Amateurliga in 1962 and captured the division title that year to begin the most successful period in the club's history. They repeated as champions in 1970 and narrowly missed advancing to the Regionalliga S√ºd (II) when they finished second in their playoff group. In 1972, they took part in the opening round of the German amateur championship, but were put out in the first round by Normannia Gm√ºnd. The team made their first appearance in play for the DFB Pokal (German Cup) in 1974 losing 2:4 in extra time to second division side Bayer 05 Uerdingen.

FV became part of this new twenty team circuit after failed a 2nd Bundesliga S√ºd (II) qualification playoff. Early on the club enjoyed a string of top four finishes, but crashed to 16th place in 1982, and was relegated to the Verbandsliga Nordbaden (IV) for a single season. Despite their poor league showing, they enjoyed their first DFB Pokal success, defeating SpVgg 07 Ludwigsburg 2:1 in extra time, before going out in the second round to VfL Osnabr√ºck. Weinheim struggled somewhat on their return until capturing the Amateur-Oberliga title in 1988. However, they failed again in their subsequent attempt to win promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga.

The villagers rose up again in June 2016, but were again suppressed. The most recent rounds of clashes were in September 2016, when the former village leader Lin Zulian was sentenced to jail. The clashes were suppressed. The protests began on 21‚Äì23 September 2011 after officials sold land to real estate developers without properly compensating the villagers. Several hundred to several thousand people protested in front of and then attacked a government building, a police station and an industrial park. Protesters held signs saying \\"give us back our farmland\\" and \\"let us continue farming.\\" Rumors that the police had killed a child further inflamed the protesters and provoked rioting. Residents of Wukan had previously petitioned the national government in 2009 and 2010 over the land disputes. In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, authorities allowed villagers to select 13 representatives to engage in negotiations. Security agents abducted five of the representatives and took them into custody in early December. The protests strengthened after one of the village representatives, Xue Jinbo, died in police custody in suspicious circumstances. The villagers forced the entire local government, Communist Party leadership and police out of the village. On 14 December 2011, a thousand police laid siege to the village, preventing food and goods from entering the village. Government authorities set up internet censorship against information about Wukan, Lufeng and Shanwei. Wukan is a village that had often been described as being especially harmonious. International newspapers described the December uprising as being exceptional compared to other \\"mass incidents\\" in the People's Republic of China which numbered approximately 180,000 in 2010. The village representatives and provincial officials reached a peaceful agreement, satisfying the villagers' immediate requests. Local Communist Party secretary of Shanwei City said that the authority of the city has been \\"overridden\\" by provincial intervention.

The village has enjoyed the reputation on the mainland for many years as a model village for its harmoniousness, civility and prosperity. Since the abolition of agricultural taxes in 2006, local government has been increasingly raising money through land sales to the extent that this is now a primary revenue stream. Conflicts between farmers and local officials have risen throughout China, often because of land seizures (or \\"land grabs\\"). The rate of forced evictions has grown significantly since the 1990s, as city and county-level governments have increasingly come to rely on land sales as a source of revenue. In 2011, the Financial Times reported that 40 percent of local government revenue comes from land sales.Rahul Jacob, Drop in China's land sales poses threat to growth, Financial Times, 7 December 2011. Guan Qingyou, a professor at Tsinghua University, estimated that land sales accounted for 74 percent of local government income in 2010.Simon Rabinovitch, Worries grow as China land sales slump, Financial Times, 5 January 2012. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, by the end of 2011 there was a total of 50 million displaced farmers across China (from all preceding years), and an average of 3 million farmers are displaced across China per year. In most instances, the land is then sold to private developers at an average cost of 40 times higher per acre than the government paid to the villagers.Elizabeth C. Economy, A Land Grab Epidemic: China‚Äôs Wonderful World of Wukans , Council on Foreign Relations, 7 February 2012. There are more than 90,000 civil disturbances in China each year, and an estimated 180,000 mass protests occurred in the country in 2010;Demick, Barbara (10 October 2011) \\"Protests in China over local grievances surge, and get a hearing\\". Los Angeles Times / Sacramento Bee grievances are often corruption or illegal land seizures. The Jamestown Foundation offers a macroscopic explanation for the rise in conflicts: that local officials, caught between local government revenue shortfalls due to measures by central government to cool the overheated property market and their personal ratings based on their contributions to GDP growth, have resorted to undercompensating villagers for land appropriations.Mattis, Peter (20 December 2011). \\"Wukan Uprising Highlights Dilemmas of Preserving Stability.

South China Morning Post According to a news analysis in The New York Times, China's village committees are elected by the villagers themselves, and are thus theoretically the most representative forms of governance, yet most residents are unfamiliar with how the village system functions, and are unaware of their rights. The sale of collectivised land is supposed to require approval of the villagers under Chinese law, and the proceeds are supposed to be shared. However, the approval process lacks transparency in practice, and most decisions are taken by the elected village committee with the blessing of the Donghai township - the level of government just above Wukan. The residents of Wukan made allegations of corruption: five of the nine members of Wukan's village committee had held their posts since the creation of the committee system by Deng Xiaoping, and the village's Communist Party secretary, Xue Chang, has been in the position since 1970.Wines, Michael (25 December 2011). \\"A Village in Revolt Could Be a Harbinger for China\\". The New York Times. Archived from the original on 5 January 2012 = Grievances = Residents in several villages near Wukan alleged that village officials had confiscated their farm land and sold it to developers. The livelihoods of many were at stake: many were facing severe hardship with no land to till, and had difficulty buying food on their meagre urban incomes. Wukan villagers said that they were unaware of the sale until developers began construction work, and alleged that local Communist Party officials had profited from the sale of communal land, selling it for $1 billion RMB (US$156 million) to Country Garden.Jacob, Rahul; Zhou, Ping (23 September 2011).

South China Morning Post The villagers petitioned various levels of government in vain over the years, accused local cadres of \\"pocketing more than 700 million yuan\\" (US$110 million), which should legally have gone to compensating local farmers, since 2006. Local officials blamed the villagers' concerns on \\"troublemakers\\" who were manipulating those who were \\"unaware of the truth\\".  September mobilisation  On the morning of 21 September 2011, hundreds of villagers participated in a sit-in protest against local officials outside government offices in Lufeng. According to official statements, initially about 50 people shouting slogans and holding banners protested peacefully.Wong, Gillian (23 September 2011) \\"Villagers riot in southern China over land dispute\\". Associated Press Protesters hoisted banners and carried placards with slogans like \\"give us back our farmland\\" and \\"let us continue farming\\". Then as the crowd grew in numbers, protesters became restless and started damaging buildings and equipment in an industrial park in the village and blocking roads. Policemen were dispatched, and one villager said that they severely beat some teenagers who were banging on a gong to alert fellow villagers of the protest. Three villagers were arrested during the first day's violence. The next day, the police station was besieged by more than 100 villagers demanding the release of the detained villagers, and the violence escalated. The news that several youngsters had been seriously injured after being set upon by 'thugs' caused hundreds of irate villagers armed with makeshift weapons to besiege a local police station, where 30 to 40 officials were sheltering. Hundreds of well-equipped riot police were dispatched, and they engaged in a stand-off with the farmers. Video footage shot by villagers in Wukan showed people of all ages being chased and beaten with truncheons by riot police. One Wukan villager described the police and other security staff as \\"like mad dogs, beating everyone they saw\\". The Financial Times reported that two children, aged nine and 13, were \\"badly injured\\", and that one may have died. Some villagers said that elderly people and children protesting peacefully were harassed and assaulted by \\"hired thugs\\", provoking an angry reaction from other villagers. The attacks on civilians by 400 police officers were described by the Financial Times as \\"indiscriminate\\". One of the 'hired guns' bragged that he had been brought in by an influential businessman, who paid him RMB3,000 and promised him immunity from reprisals for any assaults. Officials blamed the escalating violence on \\"rumours\\" that police officers had beat a child to death. The official statement denied that any civilians had died. Internet news of the riots, including photos and videos, were quickly deleted by CCP censors. Press reported that searches on Sina Weibo (a microblog) for terms linked to Lufeng were blocked a short time after the protests began. On the third day of unrest, the municipality of Shanwei, which has the responsibility for Lufeng, issued a statement saying that \\"hundreds of villagers attacked government buildings\\". It said \\"more than a dozen police officers had been injured and '6 police vehicles had suffered damage'\\". In what appeared to analysts as a change of tactics, observers noted that the authorities withdrew visible police presence for several days instead of stepping up police presence and suppressing the protesters more forcefully. Guangdong party chief Wang Yang also reassured residents by declaring that he was prepared to accept lower economic growth in Guangdong in exchange for increased harmony within the province.Pomfret, James (29 September 2011). \\"Velvet glove trumps iron fist in south China land riot\\" .

At 11 pm in the evening of 11 December, a Lufeng City official, Huang, called Xue's daughter asking about Xue's full medical history, stating that Xue had been admitted to hospital in critical condition. Xue's daughter and wife went to the hospital at Shanwei in the following few hours, and were made to wait without having access to Xue. Officials told the Xue family that Xue Jinbo had arrived at a local prison at 7 am on 10 December and died at 10 am on 11 December. Other family members were contacted and arrived in Shanwei. Ten family members, including Xue's daughter and wife, were permitted to see Xue's body, but were prevented by police from using cameras and telephones. The local police alleged that Xue had died suddenly of a heart attack after he had confessed to damaging property and disrupting public services, but his friends and family rejected this explanation, and believed that Xue had died after being subjected to police brutality.

The government dispatched a force of 1000 armed officers to maintain order, but it was unsuccessful in retaking control of the village. The authorities held the village in siege, preventing supplies from entering. Local Communist Party officials accused the Wukan village representatives of being ringleaders of the protests. County-level official Wu Zili accused village representatives Lin Zuluan and Yang Semao of organizing and inciting the villagers to set up barricades around the village since 8 December (a day before Xue Jinbo was arrested): \\"They did this to prevent officials from entering the village and to stop the perpetrators of the earlier riots from leaving the village and turning themselves into the authorities.\\" On 16 December, provincial Chinese officials \\"vowed to temporarily halt questionable property sales and to investigate claims that the local government illegally confiscated farmland for private development\\", according to official news media, but he police refused to release the body of Xue Jinbo to his family in order to have it buried.

Lin, 72, had written a letter to the village on 2 March complaining of continued corruption. Seized land had been \\"raped by power, money, and gangsters,\\" he wrote. This protest letter followed multiple attempts to gain redress from direct contact with the developer, Hua Hui Real Estate, that had acquired a 110,000 square meter plot of land in Wukan without the approval of the village committee. The company gave a perfunctory response, and the Lufeng government, in which Wukan resides, later stated that the land did not belong to the villagers. On 18 June, after calls for \\"renewed mass protests\\" over land seizures, Lin was arrested by special police who broke into his walled house in the middle of the night. In an enquiry about the land deal and treatment of Lin, the Lufeng government said that it \\"has not discovered any situation of unfair suppression or punishment.\\" Lin later appeared on state TV admitting that he had taken bribes for government contracts. This sparked protests, with thousands marching accusing the government of forcing the confession. Attempts by Lin and other village leaders to gain legal representation have been met with resistance by the authorities. Lin's family reportedly hired the civil rights lawyer Ge Yongxi, including a retainer fee. The judicial authorities later made them return the funds, however. \\"The firm was banned from accepting any client from Wukan village, which obviously interferes with our normal, legal business. ...

A peasant's son, Cherepanov served as a junior officer in the Russian Army in World War I and took part in the Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet War with the Red Army. A 1923 graduate of the Red Army Military Academy, Cherepanov first came to China as a military adviser to Sun Yat-sen's National Revolutionary Army in 1923‚Äì1927. He returned as chief military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang China during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938‚Äì1939. Appointed a senior instructor at the General Staff Academy after returning from China, he was named commander of the 23rd Army in 1941 and promoted to lieutenant-general in 1943. A member of the Allied Control Commission in Bulgaria in 1944‚Äì1947 and the commission's chairman in 1947, he returned to the Soviet Union to become deputy chief in the Department of Military Colleges of the USSR Ministry of Defense in 1948‚Äì1955. Biography Born on to a peasant family in the village of Kislyanskoye (now in the Kurgan Oblast of the Russian Federation), Cherepanov received a basic education in the town of Kurgan and was a factory worker and vocational school student in Yekaterinburg and Omsk before being drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in Omsk in 1915. He graduated from a junior officers' school in Irkutsk and fought in World War I as a platoon commander in the 8th Company of the 56th Infantry Regiment of the Russian Army's Northern Front in 1916‚Äì1917. Cherepanov joined the Red Guards soon after the October Revolution of 1917. He entered the newly formed Red Army of Soviet Russia in 1918, in which he served as regimental commander, a regimental chief of staff, and a brigade commander during the Russian Civil War and concurrent Polish-Soviet War. Selected to attend the Red Army Military Academy at the concluding phase of the Civil War, Cherepanov was one of five volunteers selected from the cadets of the 1923 graduating class to serve as military advisers in China following Foreign Affairs Commissar Joffe's signing of a friendly treaty with China's Kuomintang leader Sun Yat-sen in January 1923, and arrived in Peking on 21 June.Wilbur, C. Martin & Julie Lien-ying How (1989). Missionaries of Revolution: Soviet Advisers and Nationalist China, 1920-1927. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p. 7. . A personal acquaintance of Sun Yat-sen between February 1924 and Sun's death in March 1925, Cherepanov taught at the Whampoa Military Academy alongside Vasily Blyukher, and took part in the campaigns against the regional warlords, joining China's famed Northern Expedition as a senior Soviet adviser. He joined the Soviet Union's Communist Party in 1926. Cherepanov returned to the Soviet Union in 1927, following Sun's death in 1925 and subsequent breakdown in Sino-Soviet relations with the Kuomintang's new leader, Chiang Kai-shek. (In spite of the ongoing Soviet assistance to the Kuomintang, the anti-communist Chiang had arranged a massacre of communists in Shanghai and expelled his Soviet advisers.) Cherepanov took part in the 1929 Soviet intervention in Inner Manchuria as commander of the Red Army's 39th Rifle Division in the Soviet Far East. With relations between Chiang and the Soviet Union dramatically improved due to the attack on China by Japanese forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Cherepanov returned to China as chief military adviser to Chiang's government in Nanking from August 1938 to September 1939 and helped organize the 1938 defense of Wuhan ‚Äì although the city fell to the combined might of the Japanese troops, planes, and ships.Wilbur, C. Martin & Julie Lien-ying How (1989). Missionaries of Revolution: Soviet Advisers and Nationalist China, 1920-1927. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p. 430. . Assigned to the Red Army's General Staff Academy as a senior instructor after returning from China, Cherepanov was next named Chief Inspector for the Northwestern Direction following the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. He subsequently led the 23rd Army from September 1941 until July 1944, and was promoted in rank to lieutenant-general in 1943. His troops took part in the defense of Leningrad and joined in the summer 1944 breaking of the siege and forcing of Nazi Germany's co-belligerent partner Finland to relinquish its positions Karelian Isthmus near Leningrad. The combined Soviet gains compelled Finland to negotiate the Moscow Armistice in 1944. Recalled from command of the 23rd Army with the turning of the tides of war across the Eastern Front, Cherepanov was sent as a member of the Allied Control Commission in Bulgaria in 1944 and became the commission's chairman in 1947. He was named deputy chief in the Department of Military Colleges of the USSR Ministry of Defense upon returning to Moscow in 1948. Cherepanov retired from active duty in the armed forces after forty years in the military in 1955. He died in Moscow on 8 July 1984, aged eighty-eight. A prolific memoirist in the 1960s‚Äì1980s, he authored a number of memoirs about his military career, including As Military Adviser in China (Moscow: Progress Publishers), a 1982 English-language translation ().

Biography In 1783 he joined the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire and became a lieutenant of dragoons within three years. He served in Transylvania and against the Ottomans but resigned and returned to France during the French Revolution. In 1791 he joined the French army as an infantry captain. He fought in the French Revolutionary Wars, becoming an Adjutant General Chef de brigade (colonel) on 12 April 1794. He won promotion to general of brigade on 30 July 1799. Napoleon Bonaparte named him a commander of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 14 June 1804. Assigned to lead a brigade in the VI Corps, he fought at Haslach-Jungingen and D√ºrrenstein in the War of the Third Coalition. He earned advancement to general of division on 24 December 1805 but continued to lead a brigade. The following year he fought at Halle, Waren-Nossentin, and L√ºbeck. In the last action he captured Carl Carlsson M√∂rner and 600 Swedes. In 1807, he served at Mohrungen and Braunsberg before being given command of a Hessian division. He then led, for some time, the forces besieging Graudenz. He became a Baron of the Empire on 18 March 1809. In the War of the Fifth Coalition his division of French-allied Germans guarded Napoleon's line of communications. His forces were mauled at Franzensfeste on 4 August 1809 while attempting to suppress the Tyrolean Rebellion. In early 1810 he led a division in Catalonia. In 1813 and 1814, he commanded the 2nd Division in Italy at Caldiero and the Mincio. King Louis XVIII of France appointed him a chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis.

His career was unusual in the fact that he established himself as a high-class performer under National Hunt rules before moving to flat-racing. His win in the Gold Cup came in his third start under flat rules. Background Rite of Passage was bred by the Hertfordshire-based Newsells Park Stud. He was sired by the European Horse of the Year Giant's Causeway out of the mare Dahlia's Krissy. Since retiring to stud in 2001 Giant's Causeway has sired the winners of more than three hundred races, including 26 at Group One/Grade I level. His best winners include Shamardal, Aragorn and Eskendereya. Dahlia's Krissy was a winner in the United States and a granddaughter of the Champion racemare Dahlia. Rite of Passage is inbred to both Roberto and Northern Dancer (see below). Rite of Passage was sent to the Tattersalls October sale as a yearling where he was bought by Dermot Weld for 20,000 gns. Weld trains the horse at his base near the Curragh. Rite of Passage has been ridden by Robbie McNamara in most of his National Hunt starts and by Pat Smullen in all of his flat races. Racing career =2008/2009 season: National Hunt flat races= Rite of Passage began his racing career by running in National Hunt flat races or \\"bumpers\\". These are races designed to give experience to potential jumpers and are run at National Hunt meetings. Rite of Passage won one of these events, at Galway in August 2008, starting the 9/4 favourite and beating 19 rivals \\"very easily\\". Six months later he reappeared at Naas in a similar event and won by six lengths from the odds-on favourite Quadrillon in February before being sent to the Cheltenham Festival for the Grade I Champion Bumper where Pat Smullen replaced the amateur Robbie McNamara as his jockey. The race appeared to lie between Rite of Passage, who was made 5/2 favourite, and another unbeaten Irish horse Dunguib. Rite of Passage moved up to dispute the lead two furlongs out but looked outpaced in the closing stages and finished third, ten lengths behind Dunguib. On his final \\"bumper\\" appearance at the Curragh in May he was made odds-on favourite, but finished fourth. =2009 Flat season= Rite of Passage was switched to conventional flat racing and won both his starts. As his wins had been under National Hunt rules he was still eligible to run in maiden races and was an odds-on winner of such a race at Ballinrobe in September. He was then sent to Leopardstown for a two-mile handicap. Smullen sent the gelding into the lead two and a half furlongs from the finish and soon went clear. Although he was eased down in the closing stages, Rite of Passage won by eight lengths from the favourite Donna's Palm. =2009/2010 season: Novice hurdles= In the National Hunt season of 2009/2010, Rite of Passage was campaigned in Novice hurdle races. These are races for horses which have not won a race over hurdles before the start of the season. In January at Leopardstown he won on his hurdling debut, when his only danger came when he was carried wide by a loose (riderless) horse on the turn into the straight. At Punchestown a month later he won another novices' race \\"comfortably\\" at odds of 2/7, before returning to Cheltenham for the Grade I Baring Novices' Hurdle. For the second year in succession Rite of Passage was an unsuccessful Festival favourite, finishing third to the undefeated Peddlers Cross. =2010 Flat season= At Royal Ascot ran in his third conventional flat race, the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles for which he started a 20/1 outsider. Rite of Passage raced in third and survived a \\"barging match\\" with the tiring Akmal (for which Smullen was subsequently disciplined) to challenge Age of Aquarius for the lead a furlong out. The two horses raced together to the line with Rite of Passage maintaining a narrow advantage to win by a neck. It was his trainer's first success in the race after narrow failures with the notable stayers Vintage Crop and Vinnie Roe in 1994 and 2002 respectively. Weld emphasised the importance of stamina in the victory, quoting Lester Piggott who had reportedly told him that \\"there's a big difference between horses that go two miles and horses that go two and a half.\\" The Irish St Leger was scheduled as Rite of Passage's next run, but he was withdrawn from the race after performing poorly in training, A plan to run in the Melbourne Cup did not materialise, and Weld decided to rest the gelding in the winter, rather than campaigning him over hurdles. =2011 Flat season= Rite of Passage did not run for more than eleven months after his Gold Cup win. On his reappearance he finished third to Fame and Glory in the Saval Beg Stakes. Although Rite of Passage lost his unbeaten record in flat races, Weld was \\"very pleased\\" with his horse's performance. Rite of Passage was aimed at a second Gold Cup, but had problems in training, and was ruled out of the race by Weld five days before the event. =2012 Flat season= Rite of Passage did not reappear until October 2012, when he made a successful return to the course after 510 days by winning the British Champions Long Distance Cup at Ascot's Champions Day fixture. Assessment Despite having run only one race in the 2010 flat season Rite of Passage was named European Champion Stayer at the Cartier Racing Awards. In the 2010 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Rite of Passage was assessed at 118, making him the fourth best horse in the world in the Extended division behind So You Think, Americain and Arctic Cosmos. Pedigree * Rite of Passage is inbred 3x4 to Roberto. This means that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree. He is also inbred 4x4 to Northern Dancer.

It is a sponge- like porous structure which, in a sea urchin may be 50% by volume living cells, and the rest being a matrix of calcite crystals. The size of openings in stereom varies in different species and in different places within the same organism. When an echinoderm becomes a fossil, microscopic examination is used to reveal the structure and such examination is often an important tool to classify the fossil as an echinoderm or related creature. Evolution Stereom was the first form of biomineralization to evolve in deuterostomes, predating the evolution of spicules in tunicates and bone in vertebrates. Stereom likely evolved before other distinctive traits of echinoderms, such as radial symmetry, as it is present in basal echinoderms with bilaterally symmetric or asymmetric body plans. Stereom may have evolved alongside a transition in ocean chemistry from an aragonite sea to a calcite sea, which occurred late in Cambrian Stage 2. In the largely falsified calcichordate hypothesis, stereom was believed to have been present in the common ancestor of echinoderms and vertebrates. However, the genes which code for stereom are unique to echinoderms, indicating that it is likely that stereom is a synapomorphy of echinoderms, and that all stereom-bearing fossil taxa belong to the echinoderm total group.

Most endemic species to the British Isles are considered to be subspecies of a larger species, with mutations or adaptations slightly changing the species in the islands or in certain localities. British Conservationists often describe this as a ‚Äúwiped clean effect‚Äù with repeated glaciations forcing many species out of the modern area of the islands to more southern latitudes in Europe and perhaps even driving some species extinct. Some species which were present in Britain before past glaciations, often during periods with a warmer climate than now failed to return after the Last Glacial Maximum. Amongst these are Rhododendron ponticum and rabbits, now considered invasive and non-native. A species is only deemed native if it reached the British Isles without human intervention (either intentional or unintentional). That means that to be native the species must have reached Britain before the land bridge joining Britain to the continent was submerged. Alternatively species can also be native when they have flown or swum to Britain as is the case with many bird species which arrived after the submersion of the land bridge, a recent example is the collared dove which arrived in the 1950s, this also applies for plants which spread seed in the wind. A few endemic species are Arctic-Alpine species, survivors of Arctic species of plants and animals which either adapted to the warming climate or became isolated in suitable areas of mountains or lakes which still retained a suitable micro-climate. A common misconception is that the entirety of the British Isles was under glaciers and was uninhabitable both for humans, plants and animals. Whilst unsuitable for most species, a number of Arctic species survived in the areas not under glaciers in southern areas of England, Wales and south west Ireland and were either driven to extinction in the British Isles or to micro-climatic refuges as the climate warmed and the Arctic conditions retreated north. Most endemic species or subspecies however date to more recent, post-glacial times, many having spread via land bridges or along the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. Origins of endemic species *Ice Age survivors in suitable micro-climates *Subspecies (offshoots) of a larger species, many may in turn develop into new species *Glacial or pre-glacial survivors which have become extinct across much of their former range or have never occurred outside of Britain.

A few Arctic-Alpine species have subspecies in the British Isles, some have been in the islands since the last Ice Age, but many spread in the immediate Sub-Arctic conditions as the ice retreated. Furthermore these species were later reinforced by newer arrivals as the climate assumed temperatures and conditions more similar to the present day.

In these, Arctic species of fish survived, due often to the sheer depth of the lakes and the colder temperatures. For the young endemic fish varieties of the British Isles, it is usually controversial whether they should be considered as distinct taxa (species or subspecies) or just as isolated populations of their ancestral species. As global warming affects the British climate there is some concern for these species, some confined to a handful of lakes. Action has been taken to protect them, as is the case with vendace which has been moved to tarns in nearby mountains due to the cooler temperatures. It is hoped that these will act as refuges should the species die-out in the lower-level lakes where they occur naturally. *Killarney shad (Alosa killarnensis) ‚Äì Ireland only. *Gwyniad (Coregonus pennantii) ‚Äì Snowdonia only. *Schelly (Coregonus stigmaticus) ‚Äì Lake District only. *Vendace (Coregonus vandesius) ‚Äì Lake District and Dumfries and Galloway only. *Pollan (Coregonus pollan) ‚Äì Ireland only. *Powan (Coregonus clupeoides) ‚Äì Scotland only. *Ferox trout (Salmo ferox) ‚Äì Ireland, Scotland, Cumbria and Wales only, validity questionable (possibly a brown trout variant) *Gillaroo (Salmo stomachicus) ‚Äì Ireland only *Sonaghan (Salmo nigripinnis) ‚Äì Ireland only *Haddy charr (Salvelinus killinensis) ‚Äì Scotland only *Salvelinus colii ‚Äì Republic of Ireland only *Salvelinus fimbriatus ‚Äì Republic of Ireland only *Salvelinus gracillimus ‚Äì Shetland Islands and perhaps Scotland *Melvin charr (Salvelinus grayi) ‚Äì Ireland only *Orkney charr (Salvelinus inframundus) ‚Äì Orkney Islands (where extirpated) and Scotland only *Salvelinus lonsdalii ‚Äì Cumbria only *Salvelinus mallochi ‚Äì Scotland only *Salvelinus maxillaris ‚Äì Scotland only *Salvelinus obtusus ‚Äì Republic of Ireland only *Salvelinus perisii ‚Äì Wales only *Salvelinus struanensis ‚Äì Scotland only *Golden charr (Salvelinus youngeri) ‚Äì Scotland only *Salvelinus willughbii ‚Äì Cumbria only Extinct *Presumed British subspecies of the grey wolf *Essex emerald moth (British subspecies) *St Kilda house mouse (subspecies of the house mouse) *Lycaena dispar dispar *Hieracium cambricogothicum Distribution The distribution of endemic species seems to have a North Western bias and with endemic species on the whole showing an oceanic / alpine distribution with most endemics being found in upland areas or islands.

Veress was born into a Sz√©kely noble family. He finished his studies at the Ludovica Military Academy in 1910 and served as chief of staff of the Cavalry Division between 1933 and 1935. After that he had been a military attach√© to Vienna in 1935‚Äì1938. From 1938 to 1940 he served as commander of the 15th Infantry Brigade. In 1940 he was the leader of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade as major general. Soon he was promoted to lieutenant general and fought at the Don Front as commander of the First Armored Division. Between 1942 and 1944 he served as commander of the 9th Corps. He was appointed commander of the Second Army on 1 April 1944. Before the beginning of the surrender negotiations with the Allies Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy, who tried to step out of the war, was appointed him homo regius (the regent's deputy) if Horthy would be indisposed. As a result of his pro-German officers' betrayal the German army arrested Veress and gave to the Arrow Cross authorities; a military court sentenced him to fifteen years. He was imprisoned on 16 October 1944 in Sopronk≈ëhida but later successfully escaped. He retired in 1946. Veress was sentenced to death on 16 April 1947 on charges of right-wing, anti- state conspiracy by a People's Tribunal. The National Council of People's Tribunals then mitigated and changed the sentence to life imprisonment. He was released during the 1956 uprising and left the country on 3 November 1956. From 1958 he served as chairman of the World Federation of Hungarian Freedom Fighters. Veress died in London. He was buried in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia.

One of the taller species and adaptable for dry to temperate locations. Description Hakea tephrosperma is a large upright multi-stemmed shrub or small tree growing to high and forms a lignotuber. Smaller branches are rusty coloured with flat silky hairs or may be densely covered with short white woolly soft matted hairs. Needle-shaped leaves are smooth long and wide and ending in a small curved hook long. The inflorescence has a short red-brown stalk long, covered in fine soft hairs. The inflorescence consists of 6-22 flowers, each individual flower has a stalk long. The pedicel and perianth are white and red-brown with fine soft matted hairs. Racemes of cream flowers appear in the leaf axils between September and October. The egg-shaped fruit are mostly smooth long and wide, occasionally with small blister-like protuberances. The fruit ending with blunt conspicuous horns up to long. Taxonomy and naming Hakea tephrosperma was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae in 1830. The specific epithet (tephrosperma) is derived from the Ancient Greek words tephros meaning \\"ash-coloured\\" and sperma meaning \\"seed\\" referring to the colour of the seed.

B-Dawg, who is a \\"scaredy cat\\", tries to overcome his fear by entering the condemned manor and say \\"Halloween Hound\\" three times in front of the mirror. Pip the ghost puppy tries to warn the Buddies, but B-Dawg is terrified by Pip's ghost and accidentally completes the reciting. B-Dawg's owner, Billy hasn't come up with his History project and decides to do it on Warwick the Warlock. With the help of Sheriff Dan, Billy borrows Warwick's evidence file and staff. Billy's mother, Janice, buys Billy his costume for trick-or-treating, which is a Christmas Story-esque bunny suit, having misheard him saying, \\"Hip Hop Rabbit\\", when he meant \\"Hip Hop Rapper\\". Billy goes as Warwick the Warlock and humiliates B-Dawg in the bunny outfit. Billy meets up with his friends and the Buddies and they go trick-or-treating. Two punks, Rodney and Skip, who had scared the class earlier on during the trip, go explore the manor. They witness the release of Warwick and the Halloween Hound who step out of the mirror. Warwick, thinking that Rodney and Skip released them, turns them into rats after accusing them of stealing his staff. Warwick learns from his owl assistant, Hoot, that his staff is in the hands of Billy. Warwick immediately sets off to search for his staff and spell book. As he is searching the streets, he believes that the town is already taken over as everyone is dressed up for Halloween. He sends the Halloween Hound to find the Buddies, who ask for help from a sorceress dog named Zelda. It is here that Pip explains he is not trying to hurt them, but to warn them that the Halloween Hound is coming. After using a spell to return Pip to his body, the Hound finds them and turns Sniffer and Zelda to stone. The kids are running from Warwick and hide in the Halloween party where Warwick finds his staff. They are rescued by Mr. Johnston (who is actually Pip's owner). Warwick takes the pups hostage in his manor and says that if the book isn't returned, he will kill them. The Buddies have a daring escape from Warwick the Warlock. After escaping, the Buddies run from the Hound who has turned Pip to stone and opened the portal. The evil spirits who've escaped the mirror turn everyone in the town into zombies. Meanwhile, Hoot decides to stop and leave but is also turned to stone by the Hound. Warwick steals his book back and shoots his staff at Mr. Johnston. The Buddies hide in the kitchen where Budderball starts devouring pickled eyeballs. The Halloween Hound finds them and B-Dawg comes up with a plan. Just when the Halloween Hound is about to suck out Budderball's soul, B-Dawg signals Budderball who farts, releasing out gas, repelling the magic and causing the Halloween Hound to have his own soul sucked out. The kids and Mr. Johnston find Warwick paralyzed after opening the Bible and Billy takes Warwick's staff. He reads the spell which returns the evil spirits and undoes the hounds evil, such as turning people into stone. Mr Johnston destroys the staff to prevent Warwick from coming back. Mr. Johnston is reunited with Pip as well as the kids being reunited with the Buddies. The kids bid goodbye to Mr. Johnston, who has located the owners of Pip's brothers and sisters and travels around America to return them. The Buddies bid farewell to Pip who thanks them for helping him defeat Warwick. The film ends with the kids waving goodbye to Mr. Johnston as he drives off with the caravan and the puppies.

The title comes from the contemporary use of the phrase \\"doctrine of chances\\" to mean the theory of probability, which had been introduced via the title of a book by Abraham de Moivre. Contemporary reprints of the Essay carry a more specific and significant title: A Method of Calculating the Exact Probability of All Conclusions founded on Induction. The essay includes theorems of conditional probability which form the basis of what is now called Bayes's Theorem, together with a detailed treatment of the problem of setting a prior probability. Bayes supposed a sequence of independent experiments, each having as its outcome either success or failure, the probability of success being some number p between 0 and 1\\\\. But then he supposed p to be an uncertain quantity, whose probability of being in any interval between 0 and 1 is the length of the interval. In modern terms, p would be considered a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and 1\\\\. Conditionally on the value of p, the trials resulting in success or failure are independent, but unconditionally (or \\"marginally\\") they are not. That is because if a large number of successes are observed, then p is more likely to be large, so that success on the next trial is more probable. The question Bayes addressed was: what is the conditional probability distribution of p, given the numbers of successes and failures so far observed. The answer is that its probability density function is : f(p) = \\\\frac{(n+1)!}{k!(n-k)!} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\\\text{ for }0\\\\le p \\\\le 1 (and ∆í(p) = 0 for p < 0 or p > 1) where k is the number of successes so far observed, and n is the number of trials so far observed. This is what today is called the Beta distribution with parameters k + 1 and n ‚àí k + 1\\\\. Outline Bayes's preliminary results in conditional probability (especially Propositions 3, 4 and 5) imply the truth of the theorem that is named for him. He states:\\"If there be two subsequent events, the probability of the second b/N and the probability of both together P/N, and it being first discovered that the second event has also happened, from hence I guess that the first event has also happened, the probability I am right is P/b.\\". Symbolically, this implies (see Stigler 1982): :P(B\\\\mid A) = \\\\frac{P(A \\\\cap B)}{P(A)}, \\\\text{ if } P(A) eq 0, which leads to Bayes's Theorem for conditional probabilities: :\\\\Rightarrow P(A\\\\mid B) = \\\\frac{P(B\\\\mid A)\\\\,P(A)}{P(B)}, \\\\text{ if } P(B) eq 0. However, it does not appear that Bayes emphasized or focused on this finding. Rather, he focused on the finding the solution to a much broader inferential problem: :\\"Given the number of times in which an unknown event has happened and failed [... Find] the chance that the probability of its happening in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability that can be named.\\" The essay includes an example of a man trying to guess the ratio of \\"blanks\\" and \\"prizes\\" at a lottery. So far the man has watched the lottery draw ten blanks and one prize. Given these data, Bayes showed in detail how to compute the probability that the ratio of blanks to prizes is between 9:1 and 11:1 (the probability is low - about 7.7%). He went on to describe that computation after the man has watched the lottery draw twenty blanks and two prizes, forty blanks and four prizes, and so on. Finally, having drawn 10,000 blanks and 1,000 prizes, the probability reaches about 97%. Bayes's main result (Proposition 9) is the following in modern terms: :Assume a uniform prior distribution of the binomial parameter p. After observing m successes and n failures, :: P(a It is unclear whether Bayes was a \\"Bayesian\\" in the modern sense. That is, whether he was interested in Bayesian inference, or merely in probability. Proposition 9 seems \\"Bayesian\\" in its presentation as a probability about the parameter p. However, Bayes stated his question in a manner that suggests a frequentist viewpoint: he supposed that a ball is thrown at random onto a square table (this table is often misrepresented as a billiard table, and the ball as a billiard ball, but Bayes never describes them as such), and considered further balls that fall to the left or right of the first ball with probabilities p and 1-p. The algebra is of course identical no matter which view is taken. =Richard Price and the existence of God= Richard Price discovered Bayes's essay and its now-famous theorem in Bayes's papers after Bayes's death. He believed that Bayes's Theorem helped prove the existence of God (\\"the Deity\\") and wrote the following in his introduction to the essay: :\\"The purpose I mean is, to show what reason we have for believing that there are in the constitution of things fixt laws according to which things happen, and that, therefore, the frame of the world must be the effect of the wisdom and power of an intelligent cause; and thus to confirm the argument taken from final causes for the existence of the Deity. It will be easy to see that the converse problem solved in this essay is more directly applicable to this purpose; for it shews us, with distinctness and precision, in every case of any particular order or recurrency of events, what reason there is to think that such recurrency or order is derived from stable causes or regulations in nature, and not from any irregularities of chance.\\" (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1763) In modern terms this is an instance of the teleological argument. =Versions of the essay=  Thomas Bayes \\"An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\\".

Life and career Born in Steubenville, Ohio, Endich was one of five daughters born to Abraham Endich. She began studying the piano as a young child and grew up singing at her synagogue. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in vocal performance from Ohio University, she moved to New York City to pursue further voice studies with Emmy Joseph and Winifred Cecil. She later studied with Boris Goldovsky at the Berkshire Music Center in 1957. Endich made her professional singing debut in July 1957 at the Tanglewood Music Festival as the soprano soloist in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Missa Solemnis with tenor John McCollum, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and conductor Charles Munch. That same year she won second prize in the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air. In 1958 she made her professional opera debut at the Santa Fe Opera (SFO) as Fiordiligi in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte under conductor Robert Baustian. She performed in several more SFO productions, including the roles of Alice Ford in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff (1958), Rosalinda in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus (1959), Constanze in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (1959), the Virgin Mary in Arthur Honegger's Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher (1962), Donna Anna in Don Giovanni (1963), 'The Lady' in Paul Hindemith's Cardillac (1967), and Countess Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro (1967). Outside of Santa Fe, Endich was rarely seen in staged opera productions. She performed the role of Countess Almaviva with the New York City Opera in 1962 and 1963, and was seen as Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust with the Opera Society of Washington (now the Washington National Opera) in 1965. Her only international opera appearance was a critical success: a portrayal of the title role in Claudio Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea at the 1964 Glyndebourne Festival. As a concert singer Endich was very active. She made numerous appearances with the Brooklyn Philharmonic under conductor Siegfried Landau during the late 1950s and 1960s. She was also heard in concerts with numerous American symphony orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Cleveland Orchestra among others. On 19 January 1964 she was the soprano soloist in Mozart's Requiem for the Solemn Requiem Mass honouring the death of President John F. Kennedy in Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross. She also was the soloist in Verdi's Messa da Requiem under conductor Leonard Bernstein for the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. She recorded Francis Poulenc's Gloria with conductor Robert Shaw and the Robert Shaw Chorale, and recorded works by the Vienesse masters with conductor Andre Kostelanetz. She can also be heard as both Solomon's Queen and the First Harlot on a complete 1967 recording of George Frideric Handel's Solomon made by the Handel Society of New York with the Vienna Volksoper Orchestra for RCA. In 1969, at the age of 40, Endich committed suicide in her apartment at the Clifton Hotel in New York City. At the time of her death she was just about to start rehearsals for the role of Madame Euterpova in Gian Carlo Menotti's Help, Help, the Globolinks! for that works United States premiere production in Santa Fe.

State President F. W. de Klerk announced his government's intention to repeal the Population Registration Act in his speech at the opening of Parliament on 1 February 1991. The bill was passed by the Tricameral Parliament on 17 June. The House of Assembly (representing white voters) passed it on a vote of 89 to 38, with the Conservative Party voting against. The House of Representatives and House of Delegates (representing Coloured and Indian voters respectively) passed it unanimously. The act was signed by De Klerk on 27 June and came into effect on the following day. As a result of the Repeal Act, newborns and immigrants no longer had their race registered after June 1991. However, a transitional provision in the act meant that the existing population register, including racial classifications, was retained until the repeal of the 1983 Constitution. According to the government this was necessary because voting rights under the 1983 Constitution depended on the racical classification of the voter. The African National Congress asserted that the government was using this loophole to retain other apartheid practises, such as discriminatory state pension amounts and segregation in schools. The transitional provision of the Repeal Act ended when the 1983 Constitution was repealed on 27 April 1994 by the Interim Constitution. At this point the Repeal Act became a spent enactment.

This film was made after an international hit film The Boy who Plays on the Buddhas of Bamiyan by a British film maker Phil Grabsky..  Synopsis  The Boy Mir reveals this day-to-day life of Mir and his family from a very close-up perspective. The narrative is driven by Mir‚Äôs journey into his early teens, when he will be expected to put his childish ways behind him and begin the difficult process of becoming a man. This is hard enough for any child, but Mir has to face this challenge in modern Afghanistan. In sum, this is a unique portrayal of life, full of humour, full of poignancy, in today‚Äôs Afghanistan. The film tracks the life ten years life of Mir, from a naive 9-year-old to fully grown adult in one of the toughest places on earth Afghanistan. The film begins in the year 2002, just after the fall of Taliban when Mir, at that time, was living in a cave by the recently destroyed Buddhas of Bamyan. After a year in Bamyan, Mir's family moves back to their home in a small and remote village up north. The film covers the day-to-day lives of Mir and his family. As days pass, Mir changes, like any boy growing up. He starts understanding the world and thus a little less happy. He begins the real life by working hard at the village school and intends to become a teacher. After school, he give a hand to family members and grows wheat in the mountains. He and his father always talk about how good should he be doing in school and how much time should he spend working. As the only son of an ailing father, it becomes clear that there is increasing call for the young boy to help support what is an extremely poor family. As the film progresses, Mir turns his attention, however, from horses and donkeys and helping the family to bikes, motorbikes and having fun.

The book was written by Jude Watson and published on December 6, 2011. The story picks up right after the previous book and continues to follow Dan and Amy as they try to get back the kidnapped members of their family as they go on a journey to remember.  Plot  The book starts with Dan and Amy Cahill, the two main characters, at a train station in Florence. Realizing that there is no way to get on the train alone they befriend a girl named Vanessa Mallory to board the train. Once on the train, Amy gets information that they have to steal the De Virga World Map, which has been lost since 1932, where it was last housed at an auction house in Lucerne. As they talk, the siblings realize that Vanessa is an imposter, and hide in the luggage compartment. The two hide there until they reach the next station at Engelberg, where they run away and call the Cahill Command Center in Attleboro. Once on the phone, Dan and Amy find out that Vanessa is actually Vesper 6, Cheyenne Wyoming. Realizing that they should start at the auction in which the De Virga was last seen, Ian Kabra tells them how to dress like they fit in at once. After dressing up, Dan and Amy go to the auction, where they sneak into the record room and start searching for clues. As they search they see fax come in their names and faces telling people that they are wanted by INTERPOL and the detective searching for them is Milos Vanek. After being caught, the two take a photo of a document and leave. They send a copy of the photo to Ian, who tells them that the photo is a list of potential buyers. After sneaking out of the auction house, Dan and Amy meet McIntyre, who tells them that it is unsafe to remain in Lucerne. He takes them to Basel where the siblings agree on two names to investigate, Jane Sperling and Hummel. After a little research Amy finds out that they have to go to the Neuschwanstein Castle. Meanwhile, Jonah Wizard and Hamilton Holt come in for backup. On the way to the castle, they meet Cheyenne, who is disguised as a hitchhiker. They give her a ride until Hamilton realizes who she is, and the two ditch her, and Hamilton takes her phone. The two start towards Dan and Amy, fearing that they may be attacked. During this time Dan and Amy explore the castle for clues they find another code and Casper Wyoming. Using Jonah's name to create a crowd, Dan and Amy escape. Hamilton shows the group a lead that suggests going to The Library of Philosophy and Cosmology in Prague. At the library, Dan and Amy try to get in using Dr. Rosenbloom's credentials but fail. However, Amy gets a text from Sinead Starling, telling them that the last text from Cheyenne's phone was from Kunta Hora, a place not too far from Prague. Meanwhile, Jake and Atticus Rosenbloom find out that Dan and Amy tried to get into the library with the use of their father's credentials. Atticus remembers the day his mother died and how she told Atticus to stay friends with Dan, as Atticus is a \\"Guardian\\". Atticus pleads with Jake to go to Prague and eventually he gives in. Dan and Amy arrive at the Sedlec Ossuary. Once there, Sinead tells them that the text that Cheyenne got was from a computer. The siblings find the computer and try to look at the files. They are only able to look at one before it starts to wipe itself. Seeing as there might be a danger, Dan and Amy leave, but before leaving they see the initials of their father AJT (Arthur Josiah Trent). Once at a hotel, Amy finds out that they have received access to the library. At the library, Dan and Amy meet Atticus and Jake, where the four agree to work together. Dan and Amy tell Jake and Atticus about Vespers and how members of their family have been kidnapped. Inside the library, they start looking through the works of Brahe and Kepler. Inside one of the books, Mysterium Cosmographicum, they find the De Virga Map. At the same time, Casper and Cheyenne are in the library. The two start a fire to take Dan and Amy out by using the library's halon gas, which removes oxygen from the air. However, Dan and Amy are saved and manage to take the map. They are unable to save Atticus. Atticus is kidnapped and taken by the Wyoming¬¥s. Meanwhile, William McIntyre is killed by a Vesper. While talking, the group finds out that the map and Il Milione point towards Samarkand, Uzbekistan.

The play focuses on a group of women in a working-class suburb of Nottingham, especially Sandra and her sisters, Joan and Betty. Sandra has lost a child: not killed by an enemy bomb, but by a car in the blackout. Now, with peace coming, she is full of hope for a different kind of future. She says, \\"The world's changing. It's not going to go back to the way it was.\\"Touched by Stephen Lowe - Methuen 1981, p29. Lowe was inspired to write the play by his mother: \\"I grew up on the usual pulp of heroic war films and comics... While therefore I gained a fairly graphic picture of the life of a soldier, it occurred to me while talking to my mother that I had hardly any picture of those who stayed at home - those whose battles had been fought in the landscape I had grown up in. I knew nothing, really, about the sacrifices and suffering of the women who only a few years later were to pick me up and put me down, and place pennies in my hand. Pennies I had never thought to return.\\"Author's Note in Touched by Stephen Lowe, Methuen 1981, p2. As critic Lyn Gardner says, the play reflects ‚Äúboth the social mores of the time and the inner emotional lives of these down-to-earth women. It understands their tribal loyalties and their stern sense of working-class morality, forbidding fraternisation with the Italian POWs that might put one of their number beyond the pale.‚ÄùLyn Gardner, 2008 revival (see above, ref. 5) Time Out said of the play, \\"Touched is truly identified with working people and a radical vision, unlike many contemporary plays for which the same claim is made.\\"Touched webpage on www.nickhernbooks.co.uk Sources *Touched by Stephen Lowe, Methuen 1981 *Touched by Stephen Lowe, Nick Hern Books 2006 * www.stephenlowe.co.uk  References   External links  * Touched, review by Lyn Gardner of 2008 revival at Salisbury Playhouse, The Guardian, 8 April 2008 * Archived page on Royal Court website.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 4 August 2005. Aden was introduced in 2005 as a recurring character and as part of Cassie Turner's (Sharni Vinson) storylines. Lasance was offered the role after previously auditioning for a separate character. In 2007, Lasance was asked to return on another guest contract, though was promoted to the regular cast soon after. Aden is characterised as a \\"bad boy\\" who goes on a journey to become one of the \\"good guys\\". Aden's backstory played a substantial role in his early material. His childhood was plagued with sexual abuse at the hands of his grandfather, while Aden's father, Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson) became an alcoholic. Lasance and scriptwriters have both pointed out that these events impacted on Aden's life and contribute to his destructive personality. As Aden begins to trust others again, he gains a close circle of friends including Nicole Franklin (Tessa James), Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) and Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). He also has a nemesis throughout his tenure in the form of Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis). However, his main relationship is with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey); when the actors first heard that their on-screen counterparts would enter a relationship, they both complained to producers. Both felt like it would not work out and be ill- received by viewers. However, the two realised they had chemistry as a duo and took a chance. The couple became popular with viewers and fans coined the term \\"Adelle\\" to refer to the pair. Other storylines include holding those closest to him as hostages and being admitted to a psychiatric ward. He is also forced to cope with Belle's death after their wedding and a subsequent relationship with his best friend Nicole. Certain media outlets enjoyed Aden and Belle's romance citing the moment they were torn apart as a \\"sad loss\\". Aden also gained recognition as being a popular \\"bad boy\\" from Inside Soap. For his portrayal of Aden, Lasance won the award for the \\"Most Popular Actor\\" at the 2009 Logie Awards. Casting In 2005, Todd Lasance auditioned for the role of Jack Holden; however, actor Paul O'Brien secured the role. The serial's producers called Lasance back, offering him the part of Aden, which was a guest role lasting six weeks. Aden was brought into the serial to play a part of Cassie Turner's (Sharni Vinson) storylines. Lasance had not previously watched the serial, but upon learning of his part he said he watched it \\"religiously\\" and carried out research on the net. In April 2007, The Newcastle Herald announced that Lasance would return to filming with Home and Away. He was signed another guest contract. While filming the stint programme, bosses decided that Aden should become a regular character and Lasance signed a new contract. At the time there was a possibility of Lasance securing a role in the television series The Pacific. However, he chose to re-join Home and Away because did not want to take the risk of losing both roles. In August 2009, TV Week reported that Lasance had quit Home and Away to pursue a career overseas when he signed with a Los Angeles talent agency. However, a spokesperson for the serial said there were no immediate plans for Lasance to be written out. His official departure was later made public and he filmed his final scenes on 15 January 2010. Lasance said he was glad Aden was not killed off because it was a \\"realisation of his potential\\". While he had no immediate plans to return, he also said he would like to return one day to \\"see what Aden's up to\\". Character development =Characterisation= When Lasance secured the role, he said \\"Aden causes a bit of mischief in the Bay but he's really a good guy.\\" Aden has been described as a \\"good looking guy with a smile that melts every heart.\\" Aden is initially portrayed as an \\"anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder\\" where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being \\"an absolute bad-arse\\". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed like an idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him \\"believable\\". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a \\"good guy\\". The good thing about Aden is the fact \\"he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image\\" despite his \\"different facets\\". =Abuse= One of Aden's most notable storylines highlighted the issue of sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles to cope with the sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the \\"taboo issue\\". Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline \\"one hundred percent justice\\" because there are people, \\"more than we probably realise\\" in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims to think it was unrealistic. Lasance said he had to come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes through \\"the huge rebellion years\\" and the subsequent attempts to \\"reconnect with those people who had betrayed you.\\" Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used \\"haunting\\" techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline to show US agents his acting abilities. Lasance explained that a common theme in Aden's life is something bad happening just after each time he rebuilds his life. One such bad event is the re-emergence of his alcoholic father, Larry. His arrival sets Aden \\"on the back foot\\" again, as most of Aden's childhood issues stemmed from his father's addiction to alcohol. He also explained that alcohol abuse is often seen in victims of abuse, so Aden is angered when Larry admits Aden's grandfather abused him too. \\"Aden loses it\\" with Larry, because he has had his last chance in Aden's view. Aden holds his father hostage and withdraws his medication to punish him. Aden has had so much trouble from Larry that those \\"experiences have made him the way he is now\\", and the story comes to a culmination with Aden giving up on his father. Aden is admitted into psychiatric care after the incident. However he initially makes little progress and prefers to help fellow patient Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell) with her treatment. Lasance said that Aden had been \\"protective of Melody after Axel Hay (Trent Dalzell) took advantage of her.\\" The pair share an \\"unspoken bond\\" because of their past experiences and he \\"understands exactly what she's going through.\\" In one storyline Aden's colleague Joey Collins (Kate Bell) is sexually assaulted by Robbo Cruze (Aidan Gillett). Aden and Joey do not get on with each other, however when he finds out about Joey's rape he becomes protective of her. The incident leaves Aden \\"tormented by his childhood abuse\\" and he sets out to gain justice for Joey. Lassance said that Aden nearly gives up until he finds out she is a lesbian, and says \\"he thinks he can prove her case\\". However, when Robbo threatens Joey, \\"It's the final straw and Aden snaps\\", attacking Robbo. =Friends and enemies= Aden's main enemy throughout his duration is Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis). Aden did not like Geoff because he is talented at football. As Geoff is a strict Christian, Aden sees Geoff representing the \\"hypocrisy of society\\". He also believes Geoff is as \\"full of sin\\" and \\"flawed\\" as everyone else. While their characters clashed on-screen Lasance and Lewis were close friends in real life and learned lines together while they critiqued each other's performances. In one storyline, Aden loans money from \\"shady bookie\\" Clint Mailer (Matt Zeremes). Clint then forces Aden to throw football matches so Clint can win bets. Aden is described as being desperate for money so goes along with the plan. Geoff finds out and is \\"appalled\\" by Aden's behaviour, as the storyline progresses Clint tries to force him to end Geoff's career. Lasance added, \\"Aden tries to get him off the field, but that backfires - and Geoff scores the winning try.\\" This results in Aden being badly assaulted by Clint. Aden forms an unlikely friendship with Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). In the storyline, Morag wants to know why he has problems because she had \\"taken a bit of a shine to him\\". Aden initially doesn't want her help. Whilst interviewed by Digital Spy Frances stated: \\"There's lots of lovely dialogue that goes on between him and I - I take him under my wing and I find out what's wrong with him.\\" He eventually looks up to her and moves in with her. Frances said: \\"So I sort of adopt him in a way.\\" Morag is known for her feisty persona, Lasance said Frances was one of his favourite colleagues to work with because she is the complete opposite of Morag. As a pairing they have \\"collision chemistry\\" because \\"they don't really get along, but they do have respect for each other.\\" =Relationship with Belle Taylor= Aden's main relationship in the programme is with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey). When Lasance and Tovey found out their characters would become involved together, both did not think it would work. They both separately approached producer Cameron Welsh and unbeknownst to each other, told him of their concerns about the pairing. However the pair discovered they shared a \\"great\\" dynamic while working together and Lasance said when their storylines intertwined it was \\"fantastic\\". Lasance also said they found much of their early screen time comical because \\"one minute they're in bed, the next they're fighting in the diner.\\" Aden and Belle became so popular with viewers that they \\"coined a phrase\\" to name the couple, which was \\"Adelle\\". Lasance said that \\"The Adelle mayhem is crazy. I get a lot of feedback on the internet about it.\\" For the couple to have such a following, he felt like it was a compliment to his and Tovey's work. Jessica Tovey (pictured) plays Aden's main love interest, Belle Taylor. After Aden's breakdown and admission to psychiatric care, Belle grows close to Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Tovey said Aden will always be \\"the love of Belle's life\\", but she is traumatised by the previous events. Aden witnesses Belle kissing Angelo, which destroys their relationship. Belle is left unsure what to do because she sees Angelo has her \\"safety net\\" and Aden \\"brings out the passion in her\\". She added that Angelo doesn't compare with her love for Aden, that her relationship with Aden was the \\"most beautiful\\" on the programme and that she would never escape her feelings for Aden. Aden later \\"jumps on Belle\\" and tells her they are in love and should be together. Tovey said Belle gets \\"caught in the moment\\" and they make love. Tovey was unhappy with the fact that Belle cheated, as she thought it was out of character. When Angelo finds out the truth, he publicly humiliates Belle. He later goes around to her home and becomes violent. Belle is later found badly beaten and although Angelo is not responsible, he gets the blame. Jacobz said the under the circumstances he would have thought the same. He added that Aden \\"hates\\" Angelo. After Angelo verbally abused Belle, Aden does not \\"see eye to eye with Angelo\\" and decides to testify as a witness against Angelo. Aden and Belle are involved in a storyline where the school's formal is set on fire. Belle becomes trapped and her injuries have \\"consequences that change their relationship\\" forever. Lasance had previously been in caught up in a real house fire; he said the director of the episode \\"milked\\" the fictional situation to make it seem more dramatic than a real fire. He also stated that in the months following there would be a lot of \\"tense moments\\" between the pair. Aden and Belle can acknowledge what they have found in each other - so \\"it would be hard to split them up\\". After the attack and fire, Belle refuses to leave the hospital, even with Aden supporting her, because it is the only place she \\"feels secure\\". Belle is prescribed with painkillers to help combat her anxiety disorder. However she becomes addicted to them. Tovey said she does not want Aden to know because of the \\"shame\\" and she doesn't want him to know she has failed. She further explained that \\"addicts withdraw from those around them - which is exactly what she is doing.\\" When Aden discovers the truth he ends their relationship. Following on with theme of those closest to him battling addiction, Lasance said it reminds Aden of his father's relationship with alcohol. Though Lasance previously said it \\"would take a lot\\" to break Belle and Aden up forever, he opined addiction might be the one thing that could. Though Aden later gives Belle a second chance when she recovers. With this Lasance later reaffirmed his belief that \\"no matter what there is always a deep-rooted connection that can't be broken\\" between Aden and Belle. Belle is the first person Aden \\"trusted and fully gave his heart to after the abuse from his grandfather.\\" Aden gives up the chance of attending university to stay with Belle and takes up a \\"job of convenience\\" working on the prawn trawler. =Marriage and Belle's death= Belle finds out Aden borrowed money from Clint to pay for her ring. Lasance said it is a \\"heart-felt moment\\" and a turning point in their stories, because Belle realises \\"how far he's willing to go for her\\". Belle asks Aden to marry her, Lasance explained that it is hard for Aden because \\"he is blown away\\" as he wants to marry Belle, but he has traditional values and thought that \\"the man\\" should have asked. In May 2009, Tovey announced that she had filmed her final scenes with Home and Away. Lasance said he was sad but \\"fortunate\\" to work alongside Tovey. He credited their off-screen friendship as making Aden and Belle's dynamic develop successfully. In the weeks before filming her final scenes, Tovey asked Welsh how Belle would be written out. It was then she found out that Belle would die shortly after her wedding with Aden. Tovey said she was teary, but pleased with the way Belle would depart. Tovey said that filming her exit scenes were more emotional. Her last scene with Lasance required her to portray Belle's death scene. She added \\"I had my eyes closed and he was holding me really tight\\", after the director cut the scene they pair could not separate themselves. The storyline played out on-screen when Belle discovers she has cancer. Aden only discovers the truth just before their wedding. Belle refuses treatment because her cancer is so advanced she does not want to \\"prolong her agony\\". Aden is \\"confused, devastated, and completely and utterly heartbroken\\". Lasance said Aden is \\"destroyed\\" and feels like he is also dying in the process, because Aden has never given himself to anyone - he feels Belle is a part of him. Tovey explained that Belle is worried about Aden's frame of mind on their wedding day. The scriptwriters played the scenes in a way that kept viewers unsure whether or not Aden would attend his wedding. While Belle \\"truly believes he will show up\\", Tovey explains the tone and mood of the wedding is unhappy. Aden marries Belle, and she dies a couple of weeks later. =Relationship with Nicole Franklin= Aden's best friend during most of his duration was Nicole Franklin (Tessa James). Nicole is the daughter to his surrogate father Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby). When Roman is blinded in a car accident, he takes his anger out on Aden and Nicole. Subsequently, they become \\"each other's support network\\" and Lasance said it was not long until they \\"slipped between the sheets\\". One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this makes the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial because of the strong fan base for his relationship with Belle - which meant he knew it would \\"cause a stir\\" and divide the audience. In January 2010, Nicole and Aden \\"get up close and personal\\" and they decided to spend Aden's remaining time in the Bay together. When the two share another kiss, James told TV Week that there are \\"a lot of complications\\" for them. She said that no one knew what was going to happen next and that Nicole felt guilty for betraying Belle because she was her friend. James explained that the pairing with Aden was \\"a bit more serious and in-depth than Nicole's usual relationships.\\" James opined that Aden was also the one of the \\"nicer guys\\" for Nicole. When the pair embarked on a relationship. James opined that Aden and Nicole were great together and explained, \\"they started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more.\\" Nicole declared her love for Aden early on in their romance, so he did not reciprocate the gesture. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: \\"They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden.\\" Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship \\"awkward\\", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration though Aden realises she meant it. Storylines Aden meets Cassie and flirts with her. He ensures that her previous relationship with Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) is definitely over, then asks Cassie out. Her acceptance makes Ric jealous, so during a game of rugby, he tackles Aden so hard that he is knocked unconscious and hospitalised. Aden's brother Sean (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric in retaliation, and when Aden recovers, he gives Sean a false alibi. Cassie discovers the truth and breaks up with him. Aden next appears as a rival of Geoff's on the school football team. Annoyed that PE teacher Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) favours Geoff, Aden spikes Geoff's drink and locks him in the boot of Tony's car. Tony throws Aden off the team, so Aden vandalises Geoff's grandfather's farm, and bullies Geoff and his younger sister Annie (Charlotte Best). After a party Aden attends with his classmate Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans), Cassie drives them home. She is under the influence of alcohol, and when Aden becomes high on marijuana and taunts her, she crashes. Aden sustains a leg injury that ends his chance of becoming a professional footballer. When Geoff refuses the chance to take up professional football, Aden intensifies his bullying of him. In return, Geoff punches Aden and knocks him out. Aden later helps an inebriated Annie, who has had her drink spiked. Tony and Geoff presume that Aden was responsible as he was previously involved in similar prank with Tamsyn Armstrong (Gabrielle Scollay), and Annie lies to get Aden into trouble. The rest of the town believe he is to blame, so he seeks help from local lawyer Morag. Annie's guardian Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) hits Aden and injures his bad leg, which prompts him to file a claim against her. Annie admits that she lied, hoping that Aden will drop the lawsuit, but he refuses. He speaks to a journalist about Irene, which annoys Belle, Irene's lodger who is also a journalist. Belle writes an article of her own about Aden's war veteran grandfather, Stan, much to Aden's distress. He attacks Belle, sets fire to her article and cries. Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that he should behave in a manner his grandfather would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect that she may have infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins to come to terms with his abuse. Belle and Aden grow close again, and begin seeing one another in secret, as Belle is still dating Angelo. Aden's relationship with her deteriorates when Belle develops post-traumatic stress disorder after being attacked. She later refuses to leave hospital after being injured in a fire, and becomes addicted to the prescription medication that she takes for anxiety. Aden's feelings for Nicole are reignited, and they have sex several times before being caught together by Belle. Roman throws Aden out for sleeping with his daughter. Drug addict Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) deepens the rift between Aden and Belle, but they eventually reconcile and become engaged. In order to pay for a wedding ring, Aden takes a loan from corrupt bookmaker Clint, and loses several football matches on Clint's instruction. He refuses to ruin Geoff's career by injuring him, however, so Clint has Aden beaten up. Belle learns that she has terminal cancer and pushes the wedding forward, but does not tell Aden. He is devastated to learn of her condition the day before the ceremony, but is convinced to go ahead with the wedding by Roman. He and Belle spend four weeks together as husband and wife before she dies. Following her death, Aden becomes reclusive. He eventually returns to work, and is saved by Geoff when he almost drowns in an accident, which results in them becoming friends. Several months after Belle's death, Aden and Nicole begin a relationship, which becomes strained when Nicole tells him that she loves him, but Aden does not return the sentiment. A repentant Aden pays Nicole more attention and they are able to get their romance back on track. Aden's brother Justin (Matthew Walker) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him to admit that he too was abused by their grandfather. He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry was in the car at the time of the accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the police will think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway. Reception Lasance was nominated in the category of \\"Best Bad Boy\\" at the 2008 Inside Soap Awards. Lasance won the award for \\"Most Popular Actor\\" at the 2009 Logie Awards, for his portrayal of Aden. He was nominated in the same category at the 2010 ceremony. The Daily Record said that Aden and Belle were \\"star-crossed lovers\\". That if \\"there's one thing guaranteed to ruin a wedding it's the news that the bride has got weeks to live.\\" They opined that Aden was \\"blissfully unaware\\" for weeks and it \\"burst his bubble\\", which led them to question if he would actually turn up for the wedding. They later said they felt sympathy for Aden and Justin, because they have been \\"through an awful lot\\". They added Aden should feel \\"slightly relieved\\" when Charlie questions him about his car accident. Also adding that they were \\"thankful\\" Aden was there to give Justin some \\"much needed support\\". Amy Edwards of The Newcastle Herald opined that Aden and Belle's wedding was a \\"tear-jerker of an episode\\". She added that losing Belle was a \\"sad loss for many fans\\" because Aden and Belle were a popular couple of the show. While Victoria Jack from the publication said Aden is the serial's \\"bad-boy-turned-good\\". TV Week readers voted Aden as the character they were most concerned about in the aftermath of the formal explosion. Holy Soap said Aden's most memorable moment was \\"having a breakdown and threatening to kill his father while holding Belle and Rachel hostage.\\" References External links * Character profile at the Official IE Home and Away website * Character profile at Holy Soap * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional bullies Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Male villains Category:Fictional sexual assault victims Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Aden Jefferies"},{"id":"33201198","text":"Chuanchia labiosa is a species of cyprinid fish that is only found in the upper reaches of the Yellow River basin in the Qinghai‚ÄìTibet Plateau of China, where it mostly inhabits slow-flowing cold waters at altitudes above .

Background Parker was born in Lafayette, Indiana in 1876. His grandparents were from Kentucky, and his father was the deputy treasurer of Tippecanoe County, Indiana. Parker graduated from Purdue University in 1898 with a degree in electrical engineering. He worked for a circus, and then moved to Chicago where he worked as a patent attorney, inventor, and electrician. Music career In 1925 Parker began appearing frequently on the National Barn Dance program of Chicago radio station WLS. Parker played the banjo and sang old-time and minstrel songs in his high-pitched, clear voice. The far reach of WLS made Parker a household name throughout the Midwest. During a single week in February 1927, he received 2,852 pieces of fan mail, which was believed to be a world record. As his radio popularity grew, Parker began recording music. Between 1927 and 1931, he produced over 50 records, including many re- recordings. Sears owned WLS and many of Parker's recordings were on Sears record labels: Conqueror Records, Silvertone Records, and Supertone Records. Sears also promoted Parker's records in its mail-order catalogs. Parker's repertoire included versions of well-known folk songs such as \\"Oh! Susanna\\", \\"Little Brown Jug\\", and \\"Darling Nelly Gray\\" as well as Henry Clay Work compositions. Other successful songs that he played on the radio and recorded included \\"Nickety, Nackety, Now, Now, Now\\", \\"I'm a Stern Old Bachelor\\", and \\"Get Away, Old Maids Get Away\\". Later life and legacy After 1931, Parker apparently left radio and stopped recording, although he did return for the WLS twelfth anniversary celebration in 1936. Parker continued doing business in Chicago, and died in 1940. In 1952, Harry Everett Smith released his influential Anthology of American Folk Music, and included Parker's song \\"King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O\\", an arrangement of the traditional English folk song \\"Frog Went A-Courting\\". By 2008, the British Archive of Country Music (BACM) assembled an album of Parker's music titled Chubby Parker & His Old Time Banjo: Classic Recordings 1927‚Äì1931.

Retrieved September 24, 2011. The first version of AIMP, dubbed \\"AIMP Classic\\", was released on August 8, 2006. AIMP was initially based on the BASS audio library.BASS audio library Version 3 added a new audio engine and full support for ReplayGain, and revamped the music library interface transparency effects. Features AIMP can play many file types, including MP3, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), Dolby AC-3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, Speex, Windows Media Audio, Apple Lossless, FLAC, WAV and Audio CDs. AIMP can also play many other audio formats like Monkey's Audio (APE), Tom's lossless Audio Kompressor (TAK) and True Audio; DTS audio, MP1, MP2, Musepack, OptimFROG, WavPack, MIDI, Impulse Tracker, MO3, MOD, MultiTracker Module, S3M, and Fasttracker 2 Extended Module. AIMP supports the DirectSound, ASIO and WASAPI audio interfaces, and it uses 32-bit audio processing for its 18-band equalizer and built-in sound effects (Reverb, Flanger, Chorus, Pitch, Tempo, Echo, Speed, Bass, Enhancer, Voice Remover). Among other features AIMP provides ability to load the entire media file, which is currently being played back, into the RAM of the computer (currently the options allow for media files of a size of up to 250MB to be loaded into RAM automatically at the start of playback; the file is subsequently deleted from RAM again, once playback has finished). The advantage of this is that seamless playback without any interruptions is almost guaranteed, even on slower, older machines, and even under heavy multi- tasking with demanding programs, which may read or write continuously to and from the drives of the computer, since the file resides entirely in RAM and can hence always be accessed by the program without delay. Other common players such as Winamp can read the media files in chunks in time for playback on resource-limited platforms. The byte size of these chunks can be adjusted from a few kilobytes up to 16 megabytes. This piecemeal loading may generate interruptions during playback, including the clicking noises which may occur as a result of such interruption. As with offline media stored on local HDDs or other media or devices, AIMP is also able to cache up to 60 seconds of internet radio streams into RAM, which ensures seamless internet radio playback even when the internet connection is slowing down suddenly due to other downloads running at the same time or if sudden heavy use by neighbours or flatmates occurs while you are listening to the web radio. One drawback of this function is that channel switching is slowed as the buffer is first filled up to at least 25% before the playback starts (i.e. with 60 seconds of cache selected, the music will take up to 15 seconds to start playing). ; Other features: *LastFM Scrobbler *Bookmark and playback queue creation *Multiple playlists, one per tab *CUE Sheet support *Playing media files of up to 250MB directly from RAM *Internet radio stream capturing *Multiuser mode support *Multi-language interface *Hotkeys (configurable local and global hotkeys) *Playlist and Tag editor *Audio library file organizer and search *Alarm clock / Auto shutdown *Support for plug-ins and skins Awards *On September 6, 2007, Softpedia editor Ionut Ilascu gave AIMP Classic 2.02 Beta a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.Winamp's Future Competitor, Retrieved September 24, 2011. *On November 6, 2009, CNET editors also gave AIMP2 a 4 out of 5 star rating.CNET editors' review, Retrieved September 24, 2011. *On September 23, 2016, Techradar editor Cat Ellis ranked AIMP4 at the 2nd place of the best free music players of 2016.Techradar editor Cat Ellis' review, Retrieved December 11, 2016.

The Afrika Reich. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2011. WorldCat In this world, the point of divergence occurs when the United Kingdom is defeated by Nazi Germany during the Dunkirk campaign in 1940, forcing it to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany. Due to the influence of an active Colonial Policy Office (KPA), the Nazis carve up a new colonial empire in Africa, extending their racial genocide to Black Africans. By 1952, the UK and Germany have divided up much of the continent between themselves. It was reviewed favourably by The Times of London'Saville gives us an horrific reimagining of the Dark Continent' -- The Times 2011/01/29 and The Economist.'[the] plot is clever, imaginative and, in its finale, wholly unexpected. In a crowded field, The Afrika Reich stands out as a rich and unusual thriller, politically sophisticated and hard to forget.' -- The Economist 2011/01/29, page 93. A sequel, The Madagaskar Plan, was published in 2015 and begins shortly after the events of the first book. Plot The story is based around the British mercenary Burton Cole who has been dispatched on a secret mission by the British government to assassinate Walter Hochburg, the German Governor General of the Kongo. This plot occurs against the backdrop of increasing tensions between Britain and Germany which threatens to disrupt the uneasy truce made in 1940. In September 1952, Burton, posing as an SS surveyor, enters Schadelplatz (named for its plaza of skulls, which Hochburg says is made of \\"twenty thousand nigger skulls\\" and can accommodate panzers) and gains access to Hochburg's office, having taken the mission at the behest of Ackerman (a representative of Lusaka Mining Corporation) because of his vendetta with Hochburg. Assassinating Hochburg and escaping with the aid of Patrick, an American from the defunct French Foreign Legion, Cole is able to escape the Schadelplatz and meet with his team in a Central African Airlines plane from Rhodesia. However, they are soon spotted and shot down by SS troops (who took over responsibility for German Africa from the Afrika Korps in the mid-1940s), and Burton and Patrick flee for German Aquatoriana, to reach British Nigeria. In a subplot, Neliah, a Herero living in Portuguese Northern Angola (Southern Angola of the Benguela Railway was 'appropriated' by the Reich in 1949) with her sister, Zuri and members of the Resistencia, a Portuguese anti-Nazi insurgent group, are sent on a trek to Luanda in the face of a German invasion and, more personally, the potential for deportation to Deutsch Westafrika, colloquially known as \\"Muspel\\", to which all African blacks in German territory have been deported as part of Nazi racial purification policy. Forced to make from the Kongo after a failed attempt to steal a Luftwaffe plane from an airbase fighting a Belgian-French insurgency, Burton and Patrick head for their agent in Stanleystadt, the capital of German Afrika (apparently on the site of Stanleyville), a Frenchman named Rougier. They are forced to flee across the roof of his apartment and he falls into traffic before he can inform Cole of Ackerman's identity. Captured by a German conscription gang while attempting to escape to Neu Berlin, Burton and Patrick are taken south along the Pan-African Autobahn (PAA, or Road of Friendship) to the North Angolan border, where they are separated. Forced to clear a tunnel that Neliah's insurgents have destroyed, Burton soon meets Neliah, and they flee, with Zuri, westwards. Patrick, meanwhile, is imprisoned by SS officer Uhrig, in a facility that he discovers the dark secret of the German section of the PAA: the corpses of dead German soldiers, mixed with gypsum and limestone, are ground into the road, as part of Hochburg's ideal of \\"Aryanising\\" Africa. Escaping, Patrick meets with Zuri but is recaptured, with Burton and Neliah rescuing them moments before Zuri is gang-raped. Hijacking an abandoned train, they move along the Salazar Railway to Loanda, but are caught up by German Walkure helicopters. Although they take down three of them and a troop transport, they are derailed but still manage to reach Luanda, which holds out, thanks to an agreement between Field Marshal von Arnim and the Portuguese governors. Heading for the British consulate, Burton makes some discoveries: 'Ackerman' is really from British Intelligence; 'Rougier' is a member of the Gestapo, having testified at the trial of Dolan, a Welshman who was part of the assassination team; Hochburg was not assassinated by Burton but that was a deco, and, finally, von Arnim and the British are collaborating in a phony war in North Angola and Rhodesia to reduce the influence of the SS, who, Arnim claims, had swayed Hitler's mind from reality. For example, the deportation of the blacks to Muspel reduced many plantation owners to ruins, despite their progress. Hochburg orders the German Army forward and the British consulate destroyed. Entering Luanda's sewers, Burton, Patrick and Neliah make for the docks to get on a tug that will take them to a waiting Royal Navy ship. Neliah, defiant to the end, remains to fend off Uhrig, who has pursued them, presumably dying in the final defence of Luanda. Although Burton and Patrick escape on a tug, they are ambushed by SS torpedo boat attackers, led by Hochburg. Burton and Patrick fight them off, and in the end, only Cole and Hochburg are left alive. It is revealed why they have a vendetta. Burton, the son of a German settler in Togoland and a British woman, lived in an orphanage in the jungle following the Great War. Hochburg came to them as a missionary and had seen his family brutally killed by tribesmen, the root of his racist hatred. Although Hochburg was taken in, he engaged in an affair with Cole's mother and eloped with her. However, she left to go back for Burton, and was herself murdered by tribesmen. That led Burton's father into a depression, and when Hochburg returned to burn down the orphanage, he remained while Burton fled to join the French Foreign Legion, where he met Patrick, whom he saved at Dunkirk (a \\"fiasco\\" in which 80,000 were killed and the rest taken prisoner), leading to his mercenary life. As their tug begins to sink, Cole gets into a rowboat and leaves Hochburg to his fate, who gives a Parthian shot as his last words, saying it was because of Burton that his mother died. Looking back at the spot in which his best friend and worst enemy both died and at the ruins of Luanda, Burton contemplates his return to his lover in Suffolk, Madeleine. He comes to a realise after a conversation with Ackerman that her husband, Jared, authorised the mission, which was from the start intended to fail. With that in mind, Burton wants the ship to go faster, as the book ends with a historical note on the background of the story.

The one-story house was built in 1840 for Margaret Marshal, the granddaughter of John Marshall on a portion of the family's Oak Hill estate (not to be confused with the nearby James Monroe House named Oak Hill). The house was designed by Margaret Marshall and built by a man named Sutton. Margaret married John Thomas Smith in 1845 and they lived at Ashleigh until 1860. That year the house was sold to another relative, Gray Carroll. The property was sold by Carroll to Samuel P. Bayly in 1870. The house passed through a number of owners, with Dr. Edmund Horgan renovating the house in 1929. Horgan obtained pine paneling that had been removed from the White House during renovation work and installed it in the lower southeast room. The house is one story with three bays flanked by one-story two-bay wings on either side. The sloping site makes the basement a full story on the south side of the main and west wings. The house is built of stone covered with stucco. A Greek Doric portico is centered on the main facade. An entrance hall extends across the front with a parlor behind. Halls extend into the center of each wing down a flight of three steps, with two rooms on either side. The garden features a boxwood hedge.

In: The New Grove, 2nd edition, 2001. and undertaking his war service, Young made his professional debut at the 1948 Edinburgh Festival as Scaramuccio in a production of Ariadne auf Naxos conducted by Beecham. In 1953 he performed the role of Tom Rakewell in the United Kingdom premiere of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, a Third Programme broadcast. He would perform the role on stage at Covent Garden in 1962 and on record in the composer's own version from 1964. He sang Orpheus in Monteverdi, Gluck and Offenbach's version of the story. In 1958 Young took part, with Jennifer Vyvyan and the Goldsbrough Orchestra, in two concerts broadcast on the Third Programme, of excerpts from Mozart operas conducted by Charles Mackerras, incorporating important sources from the F√ºrstenberg Library in Donaueschingen, an early effort to perform these works in a historically- informed manner.Phelan, Nancy.

The majority of these personnel were members of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), though smaller numbers of Australians serving with the Royal Navy and British Army also participated in the fighting prior to and after the Allied landings on 6 June 1944. While all the RAAF units based in the United Kingdom (UK) took part in the battle, Australians made up only a small portion of the Allied force. The Australians who supported the D-Day invasion included between 2,000 and 2,500 RAAF airmen in Australian squadrons and British Royal Air Force units, and approximately 500 members of the Royal Australian Navy serving on Royal Navy vessels, as well as a small number of Australian Army officers and merchant seamen. The army personnel and thousands of Australian airmen also took part in the subsequent Battle of Normandy between June and August 1944, and an RAAF fighter squadron operated from airfields in Normandy. Throughout the campaign, Australian airmen provided direct support to the Allied ground forces by attacking German military units and their supply lines, as well as forming part of the force that defended the beachhead from air attack and manning transport aircraft. Australians also indirectly supported the campaign by attacking German submarines and ships that threatened the invasion force. The 13 Australian Army officers who took part in the campaign filled a variety of roles in British units in order to gain experience that they could take back to Australia. Australian personnel also took part in the invasion of Southern France in August 1944, and RAAF airmen continued to operate against German forces until the end of the war in May 1945. However, the relatively low casualties suffered by the Allied air forces during the fighting in Normandy and subsequent campaigns resulted in an over-supply of trained Australian aircrew in the UK, hundreds of whom were never assigned to a combat role. Australia's contribution to the fighting in Normandy is commemorated in memorials and cemeteries in London and Normandy. Background In 1944 Australia's war effort was focused on the Pacific War, and most elements of the country's military were in Australia and the islands to its north.Stanley (2004) Nevertheless, substantial numbers of RAAF personnel, most of whom had been trained through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), were stationed in the United Kingdom (UK) and took part in operations against Germany. The Australian Government had very little influence over where Australian graduates of EATS were posted, and many were assigned directly to British units.Dennis et al. (2008), pp. 197‚Äì198 As of 6 June 1944, 1,816 Australian airmen (including 584 pilots) were posted to RAF squadrons. Many of the thousands of Australian ground crew in the UK at this time were also serving with RAF units.Herington (1963), p. 17 In addition, ten RAAF flying squadrons were stationed in the UK. These included one regular RAAF unit, No. 10 Squadron, and nine temporary Article XV squadrons, which had been formed under the agreement that underpinned EATS. While the Article XV squadrons were nominally Australian, most included a substantial proportion of personnel from Britain and other Commonwealth countries; as of 1 June 1944 they were manned by 796 Australian aircrew and 572 airmen from other countries.Long (1973), p. 377 Owing to an over-supply of aircrew trained through the Empire Air Training Scheme, there were also hundreds of RAAF airmen in the UK who were assigned to personnel depots while they waited to be posted to a combat unit; prior to the invasion these unattached airmen were considered an asset by the Allied air forces as they could rapidly replace casualties.Herington (1963), pp. 282‚Äì283 Australian airmen march through Trafalgar Square in London on 26 January 1944 en route to a church service to commemorate Australia Day. The Australian air units were under the command of the RAF, which had 306 squadrons located in the UK at the time of the landings in Normandy.Herington (1963), p. 16 Two RAAF squadrons were assigned to the Second Tactical Air Force (2TAF), which was to provide direct support to the Allied armies during the campaign; No. 453 Squadron operated Spitfire fighters as part of No. 125 Wing and No. 464 Squadron flew Mosquito light bombers as part of No. 140 Wing.Stanley (1987), p. 149Shores (1970), pp. 281‚Äì282 Four Australian heavy bomber squadrons formed part of RAF Bomber Command; No. 460, No. 463 and No. 467 Squadrons were equipped with Lancasters and No. 466 Squadron flew Halifaxes. No. 456 Squadron, which was a specialist night fighter unit equipped with Mosquitos, formed part of Air Defence of Great Britain and was assigned to protect the invasion force.Stanley (1987), p. 149 Three other RAAF squadrons in the UK would also support operations in Normandy as part of Coastal Command; No. 10 and No. 461 Squadrons were equipped with Sunderland flying boats and flew patrols of the waters around the UK and France, while No. 455 Squadron operated against German surface shipping using Beaufighter strike aircraft.Air Power Development Centre (2004), p. 2 In addition to the RAAF airmen operating as part of the RAF in the UK, hundreds of Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel were serving with the Royal Navy (RN) at the time of the Battle of Normandy. No Australian warships took part in the operation, however. Most of the Australian officers serving with the RN were members of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RANVR).Gill (1968), p. 445 Four RAN sub- lieutenants who had been sent to the UK to undergo training were also assigned to RN landing craft units to help address a shortage of officers capable of coordinating operations by these vessels. Thirteen Australian Army officers were attached to the British Army units that fought in Normandy. These officers had been posted to the UK to gain experience in planning and conducting large-scale amphibious operations, which would improve the army's procedures ahead of Australian landings in the Pacific. A single officer represented each of the Army's corps, and the personnel sent to the UK included some of the most talented and experienced members of the service.Jackson (2004), p. 13 Pre-invasion preparations Map of the air plan for the Allied landing in Normandy Few Australians were involved in planning the invasion.Herington (1963), p. 13 Some of those who had planning responsibilities included Lieutenant Colonel Ronald McNicoll, who served on the Operations Staff of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force;Jackson (2004), p. 14 Air Commodore Frank Bladin, Senior Air Staff Officer for No. 38 Group RAF;Herington (1963), p. 15 Lieutenant Commander Victor Smith, Flag Officer for British Assault Area's air planning officer;Birch (1979) and Major Douglas Vincent, a signals officer attached to the headquarters of the British XXX Corps. Australian-born Air Commodore Edgar McCloughry, who had served with the RAF since 1919, headed the Allied Expeditionary Air Force Bombing Committee, which prepared air plans for the invasion. During April and May the Allied air forces struck at German airfields as well as aircraft factories and repair facilities in France. No. 463 and No. 467 Squadrons participated in raids on airfields and factories near Toulouse on the nights of 5/6 April and 1/2 May, and bombed an airfield near Lanv√©oc on the night of 8/9 May. The first of these raids involved 148 aircraft and was led by No. 467 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander John Balmer.Herington (1963), pp. 19‚Äì21 2TAF also conducted 12 raids on German airfields during this period, of which eight involved individual Australians posted to RAF light bomber squadrons.Herington (1963), p. 21 Australians serving in the fighter squadrons of No. 10 Group RAF also occasionally took part in \\"ranger\\" operations over northern France in search of German aircraft. In addition, the 31 Australian pilots posted to RAF photo reconnaissance units frequently conducted sorties to monitor German dispositions along the coast of the English Channel.Herington (1963), p. 25 On 29 May Squadron Leader Douglas Sampson, who was posted to No. 16 Squadron RAF, took detailed photographs of Utah Beach which enabled the American force which was to land there to locate most of the German positions in the area. The Allies also conducted a major air offensive against the French railway network and bridges over the river Seine from April to June. Bomber Command made 53 raids against these targets, of which 25 involved the four Australian heavy bomber squadrons. A total of 17 Australian bombers were lost during these operations, including six that German fighters shot down during an attack on the marshalling yards at Lille on the night of 10/11 May.Herington (1963), pp. 26‚Äì30 In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French railway infrastructure.Herington (1963), p. 31 Australian fighter pilots, including all of No. 453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting railway rolling stock.Herington (1963), pp. 31‚Äì32 2TAF's fighter-bombers also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April as part of an effort to seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No. 453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.Herington (1963), pp. 32‚Äì33 Australians participated in attacks on German defences in France in the weeks before D-Day. No. 453 Squadron made four raids on radar stations in late May and early June, and RAAF pilots serving with British fighter and fighter- bomber squadrons took part in other such attacks.Herington (1963), pp. 33‚Äì34 The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons contributed aircraft to raids on radar stations and communications facilities in the week before the landing.Herington (1963), pp. 34‚Äì35 These units also struck German coastal batteries along the channel coast on nine occasions between 8 and 29 May; Australians serving with British light bomber units took part in a further 14 raids on German batteries.Herington (1963), pp. 35‚Äì36 The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF light and heavy bomber units also participated in raids against German Army camps in France and Belgium during May. The Australian squadrons suffered heavy losses in several of these attacks, including seven aircraft lost during a raid on the 21st Panzer Division's facilities at Mailly-le-Camp on the night of 3/4 May.Herington (1963), pp. 37‚Äì38 In addition to these attacks on German positions, Bomber Command struck the seven largest German munitions factories and ammunition dumps in France during late April and early May; the four Australian squadrons participated in five of these operations, and no Australian aircraft were lost.Herington (1963), pp. 38‚Äì39 Leading up to the invasion, the RAF intensified its operations against German submarines and ships operating near France. Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to three of these sinkings.Long (1973), p. 379 Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying naval mines from April, and No. 460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and heavy bomber units took part in several minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea and Heligoland Bight.Herington (1963), pp. 44‚Äì45 Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No. 455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, but occasionally attacked German convoys in the English Channel.Herington (1963), pp. 43‚Äì44 Australian airmen were also involved in protecting southern England from German air attack in the lead-up to the invasion. From late April to early June No. 456 Squadron was part of a force that defended port cities in southern England from a series of air raids.Bennett (1995), pp. 123‚Äì127 The Australian squadron accounted for eight of the 22 bombers shot down by Air Defence of Great Britain night fighters during this period.Herington (1963), p. 23 No. 464 Squadron also conducted \\"intruder\\" raids that tried to destroy German bombers as they returned to their bases in France. During this period, No. 453 Squadron and 36 Australians posted to eight RAF units took part in defensive patrols which sought to prevent German reconnaissance aircraft flying over southern England during daylight hours, but no German aircraft attempted this.Herington (1963), p. 24 In addition to the air campaign, a small number of Australians took part in special operations ahead of the invasion. In January 1944, RANVR officer Lieutenant Ken Hudspeth, who commanded the midget submarine , transported a party of specialist personnel to inspect and collect soil samples from French beaches being considered for the invasion. This operation was successful, and earned Hudspeth his second Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).Worledge (2002), p. 51 Nancy Wake, an Australian serving with the British Special Operations Executive, was parachuted into France in April 1944 and subsequently helped to organise the French Resistance in the Auvergne region. Australians at D-Day On the night of 5/6 June Bomber Command conducted precision attacks on ten German coastal artillery batteries near the beaches where Allied troops were to land. Each battery was targeted by approximately 100 heavy bombers, and all four Australian heavy bomber squadrons took part in the operation. No. 460 Squadron dispatched 26 aircraft, which were evenly split between attacking the batteries at Fontenay-Crisbecq and St Martin de Varreville. No. 466 Squadron provided 13 aircraft to the raid on batteries at Merville-Franceville Maisy, 14 aircraft from No. 463 Squadron struck Pointe du Hoe and No. 467 Squadron dispatched 14 against batteries at Ouistreham. The RAAF squadrons did not suffer any losses.Herington (1963), p. 120 Many Australian aircrew posted to British units also participated in this attack, and 14.8 percent of the 1,136 Bomber Command aircraft despatched were either part of RAAF squadrons or were flown by Australians.Stephens (2006), p. 90Herington (1963), pp. 120‚Äì122 Australian members of No. 196 Squadron RAF with one of the unit's Stirling aircraft in the background. This squadron towed gliders to Normandy on D-Day. Australians posted to RAF units also landed paratroopers in Normandy and took part in diversionary operations. On the night of 5/6 June several Australian airmen served in heavy bombers that dropped \\"window\\" chaff in patterns that, on German radar, simulated the appearance of convoys headed for the Pas de Calais region of France. Other Australians served in aircraft that dropped dummy paratroopers and jammed German radar. One Australian pilot posted to No. 139 Squadron RAF took part in \\"intruder\\" bombing raids against targets in western Germany and the Low Countries that sought to divert German aircraft away from Normandy.Herington (1963), pp. 116‚Äì117 Australian aircrew also served aboard the transport aircraft of No. 38 Group RAF and No. 46 Group RAF, which flew the British 6th Airborne Division from the UK to Normandy on the night of 5/6 June. About 14 percent of the transport aircraft in No. 38 Group were piloted by Australians, though the proportion of Australians in No. 46 Group was much lower. There were no completely Australian aircrews in either group.Herington (1963), pp. 118‚Äì119 Australian aircrew supported the fighting on 6 June. No. 453 Squadron was one of 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude air defence for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, though they did not encounter any German aircraft.Herington (1963), p. 124 No. 456 Squadron also formed part of the force that provided air defence for the invasion area at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that supported the landings.Herington (1963), p. 123 A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day.Herington (1963), pp. 125, 128 The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew only a small number of sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or E-boats put to sea.Herington (1963), pp. 128‚Äì129 About 500 RAN personnel served on board RN ships involved in the operation. While most formed part of the crew of RN warships, several Australian officers led flotillas of landing craft and others commanded individual craft. For instance, Sub-Lieutenant Dean Murray commanded a force of six RN Landing Craft Assault that landed soldiers of the British 3rd Infantry Division at Sword Beach. Hudspeth also took X20 across the channel to mark the edge of Juno Beach during the landings there; he received his third DSC for completing this mission. Some of the warships with Australian crew members that supported the landings were (which had three RANVR officers on board), , , , , and . Australian members of the Merchant Navy also participated in the D-Day landings, though the number of sailors involved is not known.Sharpe (2004), p. 35 Few of the Australian Army officers attached to British units landed on D-Day. Major Jo Gullett, who was the second in command of an infantry company in the 7th Battalion, Green Howards, came ashore on Gold Beach as part of the invasion force.Gullett (1976), pp. 132, 136 In his memoirs, Gullett described the landing as \\"easily the most impressive occasion of my life\\".Gullett (1992), p. 195 He subsequently led a company of the Royal Scots until he was wounded by German machine gun fire on 17 July. Most of the other Australian officers served in staff positions; for instance Lieutenant Colonel Bill Robertson was the chief of staff of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division when that unit arrived in Normandy and was later posted to the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division where he served in the same role.Converse (2011), pp. 185‚Äì186 Vincent came ashore on 7 June and served with XXX Corps, 7th Armoured and 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Divisions during the campaign. Due to the lack of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians who took part in the D-Day landings, it is not possible to determine the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation.Sharpe (2004), p. 35 Historians also give slightly different figures for the number of Australians killed on 6 June. Peter Stanley wrote in 2004 that there were 14 Australian fatalities, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two members of the RAN, and in 2019 Lachlan Grant put the number killed at 13. Subsequent fighting The fighting in Normandy continued until August 1944, when the Allies broke out of the region and rapidly advanced to the German border. This campaign dominated the activities of eight of the ten Australian squadrons in the UK, as well as most of the airmen posted to RAF units. During July and August the RAAF units operated at or near their highest level of activity in the war to that point, but morale remained high as the airmen perceived that the contribution of air power to the campaign would be decisive. Large numbers of Australian airmen who were undergoing training or awaiting a posting on D-Day were assigned to combat units during the fighting to replace casualties of the Normandy campaign.Grant (2014), pp. 28‚Äì29 A small number of Australian served in Normandy with the British Army. These included a truck driver who served with the Mechanised Transport Corps, two Australians in Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service and a member of the Territorial Army Nursing Service. In addition to the military personnel involved in the fighting, several Australian war correspondents reported on the Battle of Normandy. Chester Wilmot landed with the 6th Airborne Division on D-Day, and his coverage of the fighting for the BBC soon made him one of the best-known Allied war correspondents. Other Australian journalists in Normandy included John Hetherington, Geoff Hutton, Anne Matheson and Ronald Monson. =June= Three members of No. 453 Squadron RAAF help flatten the ground at Advanced Landing Ground B11, Longues-sur-Mer (June to September 1944). They use a locally acquired agricultural roller weighed down with two 500lb bombs. Australian airmen were involved in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No. 464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France.Herington (1963), pp. 127‚Äì128 The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on this night. While No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No. 460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire, which sought to destroy the town to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it.Herington (1963), p. 131 Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France in an attempt to disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy.Herington (1963), pp. 131‚Äì132 The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period.Herington (1963), pp. 133‚Äì134 Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included at least one of the RAAF squadrons.Herington (1963), p. 158 The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the V-1 flying bombs the Germans were launching against the UK.Herington (1963), pp. 135‚Äì136, 161 No. 464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June.Herington (1963), p. 143 Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed.Lax and Kane-Maguire (1999), pp. 156‚Äì157 The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.Herington (1963), p. 142 During June, Australians also contributed to the defence of the Allied beachhead against German air and naval attacks. No. 453 Squadron and the RAAF fighter pilots in RAF units continued to fly patrols over the beachhead in the week after D-Day, but only rarely encountered German aircraft.Herington (1963), pp. 137‚Äì138 From 11 June the Australian squadron's aircraft frequently operated from airfields built at Normandy, and on the 25th of the month it and the other units of No. 125 Wing moved from the UK to Advanced Landing Ground B11 within the beachhead near Longues-sur-Mer.RAAF Historical Section (1995), Volume 2 Fighter Units, p. 128Bennett (1994), p. 113 By late June, No. 453 Squadron and the other RAF Spitfire units were regularly attacking German positions in Normandy as well as providing air defence for the Allied forces in the area; during the month the squadron flew more than 700 sorties.Herington (1963), p. 164 A small number of Australians posted to RAF squadrons equipped with Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers also attacked German vehicles and positions in direct support of the Allied ground troops throughout the month.Herington (1963), pp. 165‚Äì166 No. 456 Squadron, which was one of four night fighter squadrons assigned to protect the beachhead, frequently met German aircraft and shot down twelve of them in the week after the landing.Herington (1963), pp. 138‚Äì139Long (1973), p. 380 Australian fighter ace Flight Lieutenant Nicky Barr, who had escaped from German custody in Italy during 1943, also briefly served in an air support control unit in Normandy. Barr landed at Omaha Beach on 9 June, but returned to the UK three days later as his commanding officer believed that German forces would execute Barr if they recaptured him.Dornan (2002), pp. 226‚Äì229 German submarines and surface warships sortied to attack the Allied invasion fleet, and the Australian members of Coastal Command participated in attacks on these vessels. The two RAAF flying boat squadrons operated intensively throughout June, but did not sink any German ships or submarines.Herington (1963), pp. 151‚Äì153 The aircrew of two of the British B-24 Liberators that sank German submarines during this period included Australian personnel, however, and Australians were on board several of the other RAF aircraft flying anti- submarine and anti-shipping patrols. In addition, No. 455 Squadron took part in several attacks on E-boats operating near Normandy as well as German shipping travelling through the English Channel.Herington (1963), pp. 144‚Äì147, 155 No. 460 Squadron and Australians in other Bomber Command units also participated in raids on E-Boat bases at Le Havre and Boulogne on the nights of 14/15 June and 15/16 June respectively.Herington (1963), pp. 154‚Äì155 =July and August= By July the Allied armies were having difficulty advancing against the German forces in Normandy. In an attempt to create a breakthrough, the Allied air commanders decided to use heavy bombers to attack German positions.Long (1973), p. 383 The first of these attacks was made on 7 July by 467 Bomber Command aircraft and targeted German forces near Caen, as well as the city itself. The Australian contribution to this raid included 20 Lancasters from No. 460 Squadron and 14 Halifaxes from No. 466 Squadron as well as aircrew in RAF units. One of No. 460 Squadron's aircraft made a crash landing within the Allied beachhead after being damaged by German anti- aircraft guns, but its crew survived and were evacuated to the UK. While the attack devastated Caen, the ground troops were only able to capture the northern half of the city when they advanced on 8 July.Herington (1963), pp. 226‚Äì227 All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in a series of attacks on German positions on 18 July as part of Operation Goodwood, but this offensive also failed to result in a breakthrough. On 30 July, No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons contributed aircraft to another major bombardment of German positions near Caumont ahead of Operation Bluecoat; 693 heavy bombers took part in this attack, of which 39 were from the Australian squadrons, but many did not drop their bombs as cloud obscured the aiming markers in the target area.Herington (1963), p. 231 All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in the next major attack, which took place on the night of 7/8 August to support Operation Totalize, but cloud and smoke again prevented many of the bombers from attacking the target area.Herington (1963), p. 232 The four squadrons also attacked German Army positions on 14 August in support of Operation Tractable; visibility was clear over most of the target area, and the raids were considered successful.Herington (1963), p. 233 By this time the Allied armies had successfully broken out of Normandy, and no further heavy bomber attacks were required.Herington (1963), p. 234 A No. 463 Squadron Lancaster taking off from RAF Waddington for a daylight raid in support of Allied forces in Normandy during August 1944 Australians also continued to be involved in Allied air attacks aimed at disrupting movement of German troops and supplies to Normandy during July and August. As well as supporting the ground forces in Normandy and continuing to bomb V-1 flying bomb launch facilities in northern France, Bomber Command attacked railway facilities in France during July and August, and at least one of the Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in 15 of the 25 raids conducted against these targets.Herington (1963), p. 235Long (1973), pp. 380‚Äì382 No. 464 Squadron also flew more than 350 sorties during July and 400 in August against transport infrastructure in France and convoys of German vehicles. These operations, which were generally conducted at night, cost the unit three aircraft.Herington (1963), pp. 240‚Äì241 The only interruption to No. 464 Squadron's attacks on transportation came on the night of 14/15 July, when four aircraft piloted by highly experienced airmen conducted a successful precision strike on the Gestapo barracks at Bonneuil-Matours.Herington (1963), p. 241 Australian aircrew assigned to other 2TAF medium bomber and fighter- bomber units also participated in attacks on bridges and railways throughout July.Herington (1963), pp. 239‚Äì240 No. 453 Squadron operated from Normandy during July and August, and mainly patrolled behind the German front line in search of motor transport to attack. It occasionally encountered German aircraft during this period and shot down several Me 109 and Fw 190 fighters. The squadron flew 727 sorties during July, but lost several of its Spitfires to German anti-aircraft guns. No. 453 Squadron continued to operate against German transport during August, and moved to an airfield near Ling√®vres on the 13th of the month. This airfield was attacked by a German aircraft the next day, resulting in the death of one Australian pilot and another three wounded. The squadron experienced considerable success during the Allied break-out, and claimed to have destroyed a large number of German vehicles during August.Herington (1963), pp. 241‚Äì243 Overall, No. 453 Squadron flew more than 1,300 combat sorties during July and August.Herington (1963), p. 189 While No. 456 Squadron's night fighters conducted patrols over Normandy in early July and shot down four German bombers on the 5th of the month, the unit‚Äîin common with almost all the Mosquito-equipped night fighter squadrons stationed in the UK‚Äîwas tasked with intercepting V-1 flying bombs from 6 July onwards.Herington (1963), p. 249Bennett (1995), p. 144 The Australian flying boat squadrons assigned to Coastal Command also continued to support the invasion during July and August. On 8 July a No. 10 Squadron Sunderland sank the German submarine U-243 south-west of Brest.Long (1973), p. 384 Overall, No. 10 Squadron flew 56 patrols during July and No. 461 Squadron conducted 67, most of which were made at night.Herington (1963), pp. 244‚Äì245 One of No. 461 Squadron's Sunderlands damaged the submarine U-385 south of Brest on 10 August, and it was sunk the next day by . On 13 August another No. 461 Squadron Sunderland attacked and sank U-270. No. 10 Squadron flew almost as many patrols throughout August as it had during July, but did not encounter any submarines.Herington (1963), pp. 245‚Äì246 No. 455 Squadron took part in attacks on German shipping travelling off the Netherlands and in the North Sea during July and August, but these operations were not directly related to supporting the invasion.Herington (1963), pp. 246‚Äì249 Aftermath RAAF personnel also participated in the Allied invasion of southern France (Operation Dragoon) during August 1944. No. 458 Squadron, which was equipped with Wellington bombers, flew anti-submarine patrols and attacked targets in northern Italy and southern France ahead of the landings, which took place on the 15th of the month. The squadron continued these duties until the end of August.RAAF Historical Section (1995), Volume 4 Maritime and Transport Units, p. 102 The Spitfire-equipped No. 451 Squadron escorted Allied invasion convoys on 14 August and patrolled over the Allied beachhead as troops came ashore the next day. From 25 August the squadron was based at an airfield near Cuers in France and provided air defence for the region until October. Few German aircraft were encountered throughout this period, however.RAAF Historical Section (1995), Volume 2 Fighter Units, pp. 114‚Äì115 The low casualties the Commonwealth air forces incurred during the Battle of Normandy led to an over-supply of trained aircrew. While the number of pilots and other airmen undergoing training through the EATS had begun to be reduced in early 1944, by 30 June there were thousands of qualified airmen‚Äîincluding 3,000 Australians‚Äîin the UK waiting for posts in operational units. This number greatly exceeded the requirements of the Allied air forces. Accordingly, the flow of airmen from EATS training facilities in Canada to the UK was greatly cut back, and Australia ceased sending airmen overseas for training under the scheme in August. While 1,245 Australian airmen arrived in the UK during the last six months of 1944 (a reduction from the 5,181 who had arrived in the first six months of the year), only those who were qualified as air gunners were typically ever assigned to combat units. It was not possible to find flying positions for most of the remaining unattached airmen who arrived after June 1944, and some were posted back to Australia; the remainder spent the rest of the war in training courses and various non-flying roles.Herington (1963), pp. 283‚Äì285, 287 Australian military personnel in Europe remained in action until the end of the war. At the time of the German surrender in May 1945, there were 15,500 members of the RAAF in the UK and western Europe, of whom 12,300 were qualified aircrew.Long (1973), p. 392Herington (1963), p. 462 Most members of the small party of Australian Army officers who had been posted to the UK ahead of D-Day also remained in Europe until the end of the war. Commemoration The grave of Pilot Officer Frederick James Knight at the Bayeux War Cemetery. Knight was a pilot in No. 460 Squadron and the only Australian member of his Lancaster bomber's aircrew. All seven airmen were killed on 7 June 1944 when the bomber was shot down or crashed during a raid on Vire. Overall, 1,177 Australian military personnel were killed in western Europe and Britain during the lead- up to the invasion of France and the subsequent Normandy Campaign. These losses were higher than those suffered by Australian forces in the Pacific during this period.Grant (2014), p. 33 The Australian War Memorial has stated that hundreds of Australian airmen were killed while supporting the Allied troops in Normandy, and that \\"in terms of total casualties June 1944 was the worst month in the history of the Royal Australian Air Force\\". A total of 44 Australians are buried in Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in the Normandy region. These include men killed in the region prior to the invasion and those who died during the fighting in 1944. Of the Australian graves, 17 are located at the Bayeux War Cemetery, six at Saint-D√©sir de Lisieux, five at Banneville-la-Campagne, four at the Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, three at both Douvres la D√©livrande and Hermanville-sur-Mer, two in Ranville and one each at Ryes-Nazenville, Saint-Manvieu-Norrey, Bolbec and Tilly-sur-Seulles. The Bayeux Memorial, which lists the names of Commonwealth personnel killed in Normandy with no known grave, does not include any Australians.Lecouturier (2011), pp. 136‚Äì137 The most recent burial of an Australian serviceman in Normandy took place in April 2011 when No. 453 Squadron pilot Flight Lieutenant Henry Lacy Smith was interred at Ranville War Cemetery. Smith drowned when his Spitfire crash-landed in the River Orne on 11 June 1944, but his body was not recovered until November 2010. Australia's involvement in the Battle of Normandy has also been commemorated through memorials and official state visits. Many of the RAAF squadrons that fought in the campaign were awarded battle honours after the war in recognition of their contribution. \\"Normandy\\" is also one of the 47 battle sites recorded on the Australian War Memorial, London, which was dedicated in 2003.Office of Australian War Graves (2003), p. 11 In 2004, Australian Prime Minister John Howard attended the ceremonies in France that marked the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. The French Government also awarded the Legion of Honour to ten of the surviving Australian veterans of the landings to commemorate this anniversary. In 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and a party of seven Australian veterans of the campaign attended ceremonies held to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Prime Minister Scott Morrison attended the commemorations of the 75th anniversary of D-Day in 2019. When the M√©morial de Caen opened in 1988, the flagpoles outside the museum commemorating the countries that participated in the battle did not include an Australian flag. Former No. 453 Squadron fighter pilot Colin Leith campaigned to have an Australian flag added, and this was achieved on 1 May 1998. Despite these commemorations, there is little awareness among modern Australians of their country's role in the fighting in Normandy, and the campaigns fought in the Pacific have a much more prominent place in the public memory of World War II.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1911 to 1915. Early life Born in Ipswich, Queensland in 1858, Welsby was the fourth of ten children of William Welsby and Hannah Welsby (n√©e Billsbrough.) His parents migrated from Cornwall, England to Moreton Bay three years earlier in 1855. He was educated at Mr John Scott's school and Ipswich Boys' Grammar School. In his senior year he won prizes in history, arithmetic and Latin. As a child, Welsby aspired to study medicine at Sydney University; however this became impossible following the death of his father in 1874. The loss of his father caused the Welsby family to sell their substantial house in Ipswich and move to Brisbane. He started his working life in June 1874 at age 15 with the Bank of New South Wales in Brisbane and remained there for five years until a conflict with a manager (whom he described as \\"imported\\" from Sydney) caused him to resign. In May 1879, he took up a post with the Australian Joint Stock Bank. In July 1885 at age 25, he left his employment at the Bank to commence practice as a public accountant in Brisbane. Welsby married Margaret Gilchrist, n√©e Kingston on 21 February 1893 at East Brisbane. Margaret died ten years later and Welsby never remarried. They had three children; a son who died in childhood and two daughters. Business career Welsby's business success was helped immeasurably by his affable nature and his personal popularity. He fully exploited the personal associations that he had formed during his time as a banker. His banking experience also gave him a detailed understanding of the Queensland economy and the affairs of many of the major business concerns in the Colony. After leaving the Bank, he briefly became a member of the Brisbane Stock Exchange but within a few months he opened an office as an accountant, trustee and auditor. He subsequently was engaged to audit the financial statements of the Brisbane Town Council. At that time the position of auditor was an elective one with a ¬£60 fee and he remained in the position for ten years. Also in 1885, Welsby formed a partnership with Captain George Wallace to operate maritime ventures. The business undertook to do survey work and make coal sales. A substantial part of the business was the recovery of cargo from wrecked vessels. Welsby became a leading figure in the Brisbane establishment of the day. This was reflected in his appointment to the boards of a variety of leading Brisbane companies including the Engineering Supply Company of Australia and the Royal Bank of Queensland. His board career culminated with his appointment as the Chairman of Directors of Queensland Brewery Ltd in 1907. This last appointment established him as one of Brisbane's elite. Political career  Welsby was a candidate for the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the electoral district of Fortitude Valley in 1899, 1902 and 1909 elections but was unsuccessful. Tom Weslby on board the vessel, Bearen on the South Passage On 30 August 1911, Richard John Cottell, the Ministerial member for Toowong, died. The Secretary for Public Lands and member for Brisbane North, Edward Macartney, resigned on 5 September. By- elections for both seats were held on 16 September 1911, with Macartney switching to Toowong, allowing Thomas Welsby to win Brisbane North as a Ministerialist. In the 1912 election, Welsby was a candidate for the newly created seat of Merthyr and was elected on 27 April 1912. However, he subsequently lost his seat on 22 May 1915 when the Ryan Labor Government won the 1915 election. Welsby was by no means a natural politician. Although his magnetic personality and sharp intellect drew people to him, the daily intrigue and backstabbing of politics was anathema to him. Nevertheless, he was able to make his mark on the parliament by advancing the causes of the Ipswich railway workshops, the transformation of St Helena Island in Moreton Bay into a recreational park, and by advocating that the Brisbane Tramways Company be acquired and operated by the government. Historian Thomas Welsby It is for his literary works, particularly his histories of Moreton Bay, that Welsby is perhaps best known. Welsby was an intellectual, a polymath and a voracious reader and collector of books. Born only 35 years after the Brisbane River was first seen by Europeans, he was acutely aware of the dramatic growth and development of Queensland that was occurring around him and the need to record these events in writing. He helped to found the Historical Society of Queensland in 1913 and later became its president.Journal of the Historical Society of Queensland, Nov 1951, p619 http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:212808/s18378366_1952_4_5_619.pdf Upon his death, he bequeathed to the Society a vast library of books that he had accumulated throughout his life. Welsby was a rarity among historians. Not only was he in a position to record contemporary history, he was also an avid consumer of everything else written on the subject by others. Moreover, he was also born early enough to talk to a few eyewitnesses to the earliest days of Moreton Bay and to a great many others who were only one generation removed. One of the great achievements of his historical writings was to flesh out much of the detail that was omitted by other historians. Welsby had a truly intimate knowledge of Moreton Bay and its environs. He had travelled personally to almost every part of the region and was particularly knowledgeable of the Bay Islands which he spent a lifetime exploring in a succession of yachts. =Literary style= Welsby writes in a relaxed, easy- to-read conversational style. His style can seem almost journalistic at times, though this is understandable as much of his published material originally appeared in newspapers. Sportsman Welsby was a prolific sportsman, particularly in the field of Yachting, Fishing and Rugby Union. As a footballer, Welsby was the manager and half-back for Queensland in the first inter-colonial match between Queensland and New South Wales. He was appointed a life member of the Queensland Rugby Union in 1928 and was its president from 1929 to 1939.Ruth Kerr, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12, Melbourne University Press, 1990 http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/welsby- thomas-9044 He was foundation secretary of the Brisbane Gymnasium in 1882 and in 1904 he became a foundation member of the Amateur Fishing Association. He sponsored boxing matches and formed the Queensland Amateur Boxing and Wrestling Union in 1909. Welsby's motor launch Sunbeam Perhaps his most important contribution to Queensland sport was the part that he played in the formation of the Brisbane Sailing Club which was later to become the Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron. Welsby was a passionate yachtsman and owned a number of boats over the years including Rip, Charm, Vagabond, Bohemian, Amity and the motor launch Sunbeam. He was Commodore of the Squadron between 1903 and 1909 and donated the Amity Cup. In 1918 he published \\"The History of the Royal Queensland Yacht Club.\\" Later life Welsby died in 1941 and was cremated. His ashes were later interred with his wife and son at Toowong Cemetery.Welsby Thomas ‚Äì Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 9 September 2012. Legacy The locality of Welsby on Bribie Island was named after him. The library of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland is named after him.

It is Utami's first novel, and depicts the lives of four sexually-liberated female friends, and a former Catholic priest, Saman, for whom the book is named. Written in seven to eight months while Utami was unemployed, Saman sold over 100,000 copies and ignited a new literary movement known as sastra wangi (originally used pejoratively) that opened the doors to an influx of sexually-themed literary works by young Indonesian women. Saman deals explicitly with themes of sexuality, taboo for women writers in Indonesia at that time. She also writes about the supernatural and mysticism. Utami has said the stories reflect some of her personal experiences, such as her loss of religion which mirrors that of the priest, Saman. Utami also includes passages reflecting the destructiveness of Suharto's political authoritarianism; in later interviews she said the political realities reflected in Saman are still applicable to post-Suharto Indonesia. Saman won the 1997 Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition, which led to its publication. Critical reception was mixed. Some critics praised the richness of its language, while others derided the novel for its sexual explicitness and questioned whether it was Utami's own work. The novel eventually was hailed for its groundbreaking portrayal of a woman's views of sexuality. , it has been translated into six languages and won several awards, including the 2000 Prince Claus Award. A film adaptation is in the making. Plot Saman follows four sexually liberated female friends: Yasmin, a married Catholic lawyer from Medan; Cok, a Balinese lawyer with a high libido; Shakuntala, a bisexual Catholic Javanese dancer; and Laila, a Muslim Minangkabau journalist. The other protagonist is the titular Saman, a former Catholic priest turned human rights activist who becomes the target of sexual advances by Yasmin and Cok. The first chapter, beginning in Central Park, New York, describes Laila waiting for the married Sihar and planning to lose her virginity to him. Eventually Laila realises that Sihar is with his wife, and feels depressed. The second chapter covers Saman's childhood‚Äîincluding his relationship with his mother, a woman drawn to the spiritual world‚Äîhis entry into priesthood, and his attempt to protect a rubber tapping community from the attempt by a local plantation to acquire their land. After the attempt fails and the plantation's hired thugs raze the community to the ground and kills those who resist, Saman is captured and tortured. He eventually is broken out of his confinement by the surviving resistance members, becoming a fugitive and relinquishing his duty as a priest. He becomes a human rights advocate, assisted by Yasmin. The third chapter, written from the point of view of Shakuntala, tells how Yasmin, Cok, Shakuntala, and Laila met at high school and their escapades there, both sexual and academic. Shakuntala recounts a fantasy she had as a teenager about meeting a \\"foreign demon\\", embracing him and then having a debate on the different cultural aspects of sexuality. Towards the end of the chapter, Shakuntala notes that she is attracted to Laila and dislikes Sihar, but supports her friend's efforts as she cares for her. During the fourth chapter, Saman is spirited away to New York by Yasmin and Cok. Although both Cok and the married Yasmin make advances toward him, he initially declines. However, during the middle of the night he and Yasmin have sex, but Saman is distressed because he ejaculated quickly. The entirety of the last chapter consists of emails sent between Saman and Yasmin, discussing their insecurities, that become increasingly sexualised. Writer Ayu Utami wrote Saman in seven to eight months while unemployed. When written, Saman was intended to be included in a work in progress entitled (Laila Does Not Come to New York). However, after the character Larung became too developed Utami split the storylines. Saman was published first, with Larung following in 2001. Saman was written during a period of seven to eight months while Utami was unemployed. A. Junaidi of The Jakarta Post suggests that the political insights in Saman are partially inspired by Utami's earlier career as a journalist, both with Forum Keadilan and as a founding member of the Alliance of Independent Journalists. Themes Junaidi notes that although Saman is about a female's perspective of sexuality, it also deals with the authoritarianism of Suharto's regime of the New Order, including the repression of human rights activists. In a 2005 interview with The Jakarta Post, Utami said that her critique of the New Order is still relevant; at the time of the interview, she saw the Suharto government as having left Indonesia with a legacy of what she calls \\"nuclear waste\\", including a loss of Indonesia's agricultural ability. In the interview, Utami also noted that Indonesians had become corrupt and lazy, increasingly bureaucratic, and without a feeling of sportsmanship. Utami has also noted that the novel is a reflection of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although little of it directly reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects her own, and the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped. Barbara Hatley notes that Saman contrasts the perceived differences between Eastern and Western cultures. She cites the scene where Shakuntala fantasizes encountering a \\"foreign demon\\" (European explorer) while bathing, later \\"embracing\\" him and discussing the \\"bizarre\\" requirement that Asian men are required to wear penis decorations and the \\"crassness\\" of Europeans who do not care about virginity, wear bikinis in public, and show sex on television. According to Hatley, this is rendered more ironic by both characters being naked during the discussion. She also notes that Saman touches on the traditional archetype of feminine power drawn from nature and the supernatural, and it reinterprets the hero archetype through Saman, who is small, thin, and inexperienced with women but able to withstand torture and defend a community of rubber tappers. Junaidi writes that Saman also includes bits of the supernatural, including ghosts and mysticism. In her master's thesis, Micaela Campbell writes that Saman's mother, known only as \\"Ibu\\" (Indonesian for 'Mother'), was \\"highly susceptible to supernatural forces that seem to govern over her\\". Through Ibu, Javanese mysticism and other supernatural content is introduced that contrasts Saman's father, a realist; this leads to Ibu \\"failing\\" in her role as a mother, and, according to Campbell, may be a factor driving Saman to priesthood. Campbell notes that Shakuntala also lives in a world of jinns and peri; however, unlike Ibu, Shakuntala draws further strength from this spiritual world. Release and reception Goenawan Muhammad was among those suggested as the true author of Saman. Saman was released in 1998 after winning the 1997 Jakarta Art Institute novel writing contest. In 1998, Saman won the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. In 2000, it received the Prince Claus Award. By 2005, it had been translated into Dutch and English; the English translation took a long time to write because Utami was concerned that an overexplanation of the novel caused it to lose all of its sensuality. It has also been translated into French, Czech, and Japanese (by two separate translators). , a translation into Korean is underway. By 2004, the book had sold 100,000 copies, a large figure for an Indonesian novel. Critical reception was mixed. Some critics praised the \\"rich language\\" used in the novel. However, others disapproved of the open sexuality of the novel, and its explicit use of the words \\"penis\\", \\"vagina\\", \\"orgasm\\" and \\"condoms\\" was considered \\"too much\\"; other controversial terms include \\"rape me\\", \\"I am still a virgin\\", and \\"masturbation\\". Utami's own mother refused to read the novel aloud to her nearly blind husband, stating that it is \\"not meant for those of their generation\\". Campbell notes that the use of language in Saman reflects the positioning of the female characters as self- empowered and independent, capable of making their own decisions. In Saman Utami became one of the first female Indonesian authors to explicitly discuss sexuality, generally a taboo subject for women, in her work. However, when it was first released Utami faced charges that she was not the actual writer; among those suggested as the author was poet Goenawan Mohamad, known as Utami's mentor. Mohamad denied the rumours and said that he wished he \\"could write the kind of prose which Ayu uses\\". Utami suggests that the rumours were based on a belief that only men could write good novels; the literature scene before Saman had indeed been dominated by male writers. The novel started a new era of literature after the downfall of President Suharto and ignited the sastra wangi (literally 'fragrant literature') literary movement as well as an influx of sexually themed literary works by women. Utami disagrees with the label sastra wangi, stating that it reflects the obsession of the press with the women writers and not their work. a film adaptation is in the works, with Dutch screenwriter Orlow Seunke expressing interest to be involved with the project. However, Seunke and Utami have had creative differences regarding which characters should be kept.

He was best known for his first work The Broken Melody, which was adapted into a 1938 film.'BOY'S AMBITION REALISED How 'Broken Melody' Was Written', The Courier-Mail (Brisbane), Tuesday 5 July 1938 p 10 Biography Born in the inner Sydney suburb of Balmain, Thwaites left school at the age of 13 and originally worked in the clothing industry. He wrote The Broken Melody when he was 19; it was originally self-published but eventually became a best seller, selling 55,000 copies in Australia and 25,000 in England. In February 1933 Thwaites left for England to write screen scenarios for Elstree Studios. He spent several months there, and several months in Hollywood, attempting to sell his work to movie producers. Thwaites said on his return: > I spent four months in Hollywood but had bad luck with my novels because of > copyright laws. It is absolutely essential that after publication of a book > in Australia and before three months has passed it has been copyrighted in > Washington. I failed to do that, and I have no doubt it cost me the loss of > the three pictures, for the picture folk only make pictures of stories that > have been out twelve months on the American market and are protected, > whereas my stories were open for any American publisher to copy without > paying a cent. He later estimated this cost him ¬£15,000. On his return to Australia in late 1933, Thwaites then toured the country looking for manuscripts to publish. In 1936 he founded his own publishing firm. F. J. Thwaites. In May 1937 Thwaites joined Adelaide radio station 5KA as production manager. During this time he met Jessica Harcourt, who became his wife. In 1938, Thwaites and his wife left for England via the Pacific Islands and Panama Canal, researching material for novels. They ended to stay in England for three years but World War II saw them return to Australia after by the end of 1939. Thwaites was one of the most popular Australian authors of the 1940s and 1950s, with many of his works being adapted for radio. In late 1954 Thwaites set up a company in England, Harcourt Press, to publish his books there. Thwaites was married to actor Jessica Harcourt from 1938 until his death and together they had two sons.Blaber, Ron, 'Thwaites, Frederick Joseph (1908‚Äì1979)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University accessed 5 March 2012 Much of his work was set in the Riverina region. His great-grandfather was Frederick Jenkins, who started Buckinbong Station. In the late 1960s Thwaites was financing and managing housing projects. Adaptations Thwaites was no fan of the Australian film industry. According to a 1933 interview: > He deplored the presentation abroad of such films as On Our Selection, > Harmony Row, The Sentimental Bloke, and The Squatter's Daughter, in all of > which there was at least one imbecile or half-wit.

The Broken Melody was turned into an Australian film in 1938, directed by Ken G. Hall, who had made On Our Selection and The Squatter's Daughter. In 1935 it was announced that Broken Wings and Flames of Convention were to be filmed in England but this did not appear to happen.

He soon founded his own chain, Eisner Grocery. It soon grew into a 43-store chain of supermarkets with operations in downstate Illinois and Western Indiana. In 1957, The Jewel Companies, Inc. acquired Eisner Food Stores, and within a few years, the Eisner stores began to closely resemble Jewel in both appearance and marketing strategies. Eisner continued to be managed from Champaign, Illinois. Following the acquisition by Jewel, most Eisner stores were remodeled into Eisner-Osco stores, which combined the products sold by Eisner and Osco Drug. The new stores included common checkout stands but separate store management, all under one roof. Some locations were next to a Turn Style discount store to form Turn Style/Eisner Family Centers, which had a grocery store, drug store, and discount store under one roof. In 1981, Jewel decided to expand into the downstate area and rebranded the Eisner stores. Today in Champaign, there is a park named after the Eisners, called Eisner Park.

Barapa Barapa have extensive shared country with their traditional neighbours, the Wemba-Wemba and Yorta Yorta, covering Deniliquin, the Kow Swamp and Perrricoota/Koondrook. The Barapa Barapa form part of the North-West Nations Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Group, and undertake significant cultural heritage and Natural Resource Management work in the area. Language R. H. Mathews wrote an early sketch of the grammar of the Barapa Barapa language, and stated that one dialect at least existed, spoken on the Murray River near Swan Hill. Country Baraparapa territory which covered areas in what are now the states of New South Wales and Victoria, is estimated to have taken in some of land, southern tributaries of the Murrumbidgee River from above Hay down to Kerang. One early source also has them, perhaps a distinct horde, present in Moulamein It included Cohuna, Gunbower, Brassi, Conargo, and the land south of Carrathool. Deniliquin Their neighbours to the north west were the Wemba-Wemba, the Wergaia frontier was directly to the west, the Yorta Yorta boundaries ran north and south to their east. The Djadjawurrung lay to the south. Social organization The Barapabarapa hordes had a moiety (kin ship) moiety society divided into two phratries, each comprising two sections.

Their sons are Murri, daughters Matha. In terms of initiation ceremonies, the Barapabarapa rites were essentially the same as those prevailing among the Wiradjuri. Lifestyle The Barapa Barapa were one of the Murray River Wongal-chewing groups: wangul bulrushes were chewed both for the tuberous pith and for the fibrous cortex which was torn away to obtain the latter. The fibre was conserved to make strings for fashioning nets and bags. History A mortar in Barapa barapa territory, at Koondrook Perricoota Forest near Barbers Creek, was recovered in 2012 and an analysis led to the suggestion that it might have been employed to grind gypsum, used by more northerly tribes in funerals, but here perhaps for obtaining a corroboree body paint.

This branch is responsible for providing personnel service support by manning the force, providing human resources services, coordinating personnel support, Army band operations, and recruiting and retention. The objective of the Adjutant General Corps is to \\"maximize operational effectiveness of the total force by anticipating, manning, and sustaining military operations. HR support operations accomplish this by building, generating, and sustaining the force providing combatant commanders the required forces for missions and supporting leaders and Soldiers at all levels.\\" History The Adjutant General's Corps dates back to the formation of the U.S. Army. Horatio Gates, a former British Army officer, is honored as the father of the Adjutant General's Corps. On 16 June 1775, the Continental Congress appointed him as the first Adjutant General to George Washington with the commission of a brigadier general. Historically, he was the second officer to receive a commission in the Continental Army, preceded only by George Washington. With that appointment, the second oldest existing branch of the Army was born. General Gates' primary duty was to serve as key advisor and principal assistant to General Washington. Through his skill and ability, he organized the state militias into what became the Continental Army. Horatio Gates proved himself an able assistant as well as a competent field commander. Under his leadership, the Continental Army won the Battle of Saratoga ‚Äì considered by many to be the turning point of the Revolutionary War. Following this important strategic victory over the British, the Continental Congress awarded what was then our nation's highest honor, the congressional gold medal. The use of the Horatio Gates bronze and gold medals, which recognize superior achievement and service to the Regiment, dates from this important event. Adjutant General Corps officers served in the War of 1812. Two men in particular who served as the Adjutant General during this period rose to prominence. General Alexander Macomb gained fame by repulsing the British in the Battle of Plattsburgh, and later becoming the Commanding General of the Army. The other, Brigadier General Zebulon Pike, the famous explorer, died in battle while leading the attack on York, Canada. With the appointment of Brevet Brigadier General Roger Jones in 1825, the office grew in importance. During his tenure, General Jones molded the office of the Adjutant General into the central bureau of the War Department. Adjutants General became the only officers invested with the authority to speak and sign official correspondence \\"for the commander\\". Recognizing this, the Army began appointing West Point graduates almost exclusively as Adjutants General from 1839 through the early 1900s. The first two graduates so appointed, Samuel Cooper and Lorenzo Thomas, served with distinction as Adjutants General during the Civil War. Cooper served the Confederacy, while Thomas served the Union. In 1861, two assistant Adjutants General, Major McDowell and Captain Franklin, drew up the plans to organize the more than 500,000 men who volunteered to fight for the Union. Their efforts, and others like them on both sides, built the massive armies of our Civil War years. Following the Civil War, Brigadier General Edward D. Townsend took on the mission of compiling all the records of the war, both North and South. The Adjutant General's Department's \\"War of the Rebellion: Official Records\\" became an invaluable contribution to American military history. The Department also discharged more than 800,000 men and enlisted 36,000 new recruits for the post Civil War Regular Army. On 14 December 1872, the Adjutant General's Department adopted the old topographic engineer shield as its own branch insignia. The shield symbolized the Adjutant General's role of speaking \\"for the commander\\". Thirteen embossed stars replaced the \\"T.E.\\" on the upper shield, creating the crest worn by all Adjutant General's Corps officers of today. By the onset of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, the Adjutant General's Office had evolved as the central coordinating bureau in the Army (continuing the legacy it developed during the Civil War). Major General William Harding Carter, under the direction of visionary Secretary of War Elihu Root, continued modernization efforts by implementing the general staff concept based upon European models. The Adjutant General's Department and the newly organized general staff evolved over the years as some functions were transferred and others modified. Several functions, formally part of the Adjutant General's Office, now evolved into independent staff agencies after World War I. The Inspector General, the Provost Marshal, the Assistant Chief for Intelligence, and the Chief of Military History all owe their beginnings to The Adjutant's General Office. During World War II, more than 15,000 officers, soldiers, and civilians served in the Office of the Adjutant General. By the end of the war, the Adjutant General's Corps processed more than six million soldiers back into civilian life. In what has been described as one of the most successful administrative tasks ever carried out, the AG Corps processed nearly one-half million discharges a month in accomplishing this difficult mission. Since World War II, the Adjutant General's Corps has been combat tested on several far-flung battlefields such as Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, and, most recently, in the Persian Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm). AG soldiers mobilized 139,207 reserve component soldiers (equating to 1,045 Reserve and National Guard units of all types), recalled 1,386 retirees to active duty, deployed 1,600 Army civilians to Southwest Asia, processed over 10,000 individual and unit replacements, and delivered more than 27,000 tons of mail to deployed Army forces. = Personnel Services Delivery RedesignHUMAN RESOURCES (HR) OPTIMIZATION OPERATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONCEPT PAPER 4 December 2019 = The onset of the Global War on Terror shifted the paradigm to smaller scale engagements using asymmetric means and methods to attrite our forces, and our will, over longer duration conflicts. These new threats and perceived changes in the character of war drove the shift to ‚Äúmodularity‚Äù and to brigade combat teams (BCTs) vice Divisions as the combined arms building blocks. Before 2006, Human Resources (HR) operations was conducted primarily by Personnel Detachments, Personnel Service Battalions (PSBs) and Personnel Groups under Personnel Commands (PERSCOMs) that coordination with G1s at echelon. Replacement Battalions and Companies provided critical replacement management and oversight, as well as care and feeding, to individual replacements in addition to operating CONUS replacement centers if/when mobilized. Human Resources support to Divisional maneuver brigades was achieved through habitual relationships with supporting PSBs and subordinate detachments. Execution of the modular force concept divested the division structure of its organic or assigned functional battalions and the corps of its separate brigades. The Army used these reductions as the bill payers to increase the organic capability of modular brigades. The Army HR community‚Äôs response to this transformation was Personnel Services Delivery Redesign. Personnel Detachments, Personnel Service Battalions, Personnel Groups, Personnel Commands, and Replacement Battalions/Companies were deactivated as part of PSDR as HR structure focused on empowering brigade and battalion commanders, through more robust S1 sections, with organic assets and systems to provide internal HR support over- watched by Division G1s. Remaining HR force structure (SRC 12) was designed to be modular and focused on providing HR planning, coordination, and integration within sustainment operations to provide casualty liaison, personnel accountability, and postal support only required during deployed operations: the Human Resources Sustainment Center at the Theater Sustainment Command; Human Resources Operations Branches within the Expeditionary Sustainment Command and Sustainment Brigade; Human Resources Company providing mission command for multifunction HR and Postal platoons; Theater Gateway Personnel Accountability Team at the APOD/SPOD; and Military Mail Terminal at the APOD/SPOD.

The basic design‚Äîthe shield from the Coat of Arms of the United States‚Äîwas adopted in 1872 as a solid shield of silver, bearing thirteen stars. In 1924, this design was authorized to be made in gold metal with the colors red, white, and blue in enamel. In December 1964, the insignia was changed to silver base metal with silver stars and silver and red enamel stripes.

It is also the second part of the two part premiere of the ninth season. Plot Walden (Ashton Kutcher) buys the Harper beach house, and Alan (Jon Cryer) prepares to move in with his mother Evelyn (Holland Taylor). Walden asks Berta (Conchata Ferrell) to stay as a live-in housekeeper, an offer which Berta, being attracted to Walden, readily accepts. (She takes great pleasure in taking \\"Zippy's\\" room, even telling him her plan). Alan quickly becomes uncomfortable living with his mother again, as she essentially ignores Alan. Disgusting him further, Evelyn tells Alan to come check on her if the date she's going to have rough sex with \\"can't hear her safe word\\". Walden stops by Evelyn's to drop off some of Alan's things he left behind (which are books on how to get women), and invites Alan to go out and do something. Alan, desperate to get away from his mother, quickly agrees. Walden begins talking about his wife, Bridget (Judy Greer), who has spurned him, driving more recklessly the more he dwells on the topic. This causes Alan to wet himself out of fear for his life. Eventually, the two pull up to Walden's mansion, where Bridget tells him to get lost. Alan is shocked Walden will not stand down and comply with his wife and is forced to help him hop the fence at his gate to get in. However, once Alan is dragged up with Walden, Bridget warns them she'll turn on the electricity, but Walden says she's bluffing. Terribly wrong, Walden and Alan receive a massive shock to their crotches and fall into Walden's lawn. They recover inside Walden's mansion, being nursed by Bridget. She complains that she is more of a mother than a wife to her husband, as Walden acts immaturely on a regular basis (the entire living room is filled with arcade games and game tables such as foosball). Bridget tells Walden that she does love him, but she couldn't stand the way they lived. Alan and Walden leave, and wake up the next morning back in Malibu, drunk, naked, and sharing a deck chair and a blanket. Alan is at first horrified he might have done something he might regret, but Walden tells him they went skinny dipping. Further confused, Alan asks who would suggest it. Berta gives an answer from the next lawn chair, covered in a larger blanket. After getting dressed, Alan finds a girl in a bikini named Penelope (Stephanie Jacobsen) looking for Charlie. Alan tells her about his death, but that is quickly forgotten as she lays eyes on Walden. The two hit it off and Alan prepares to leave. However, Bridget stops by and Alan ends up saving Walden by claiming Penelope is his girlfriend (much to her disgust) and leading her out. Bridget then apologizes for acting harshly the night before, and offers to give Walden a chance to prove himself. Alan leaves, but is quickly stopped by Walden, who tells Alan that he will do any favor Alan wishes as a \\"thank you\\" for all the help Alan has given him. Alan asks to move back into the beach house with Walden, saying he will only stay until he can find another place. Walden agrees, and Alan quietly celebrates moving back in, fully intending to stay for good. Production This episode marks the third appearance of Judy Greer on the show. She appeared during the fourth season in the episodes \\"Smooth as a Ken Doll\\" and \\"Aunt Myra Doesn't Pee a Lot\\" as Judith's sister-in-law Myra. She also appeared during the third season of Lorre's sister show The Big Bang Theory in the episode \\"The Plimpton Stimulation\\" as Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton. Starting with this episode, Greer portrays Bridget, Walden's estranged wife. The episode had the show's third highest number of viewers ever and was the third episode to pull in over 20 million viewers.

Its common names include the Dalmatian Linckia, mottled Linckia, spotted Linckia, multicolor sea star and multi-pore sea star.Seeing stars: Linckia multifora The Right Blue. Retrieved 2011-09-24. Description Linckia multifora has a small disk and five long, slim cylindrical arms that taper slightly towards the tips. The colour is variable and includes brown, pink, red, or gray with small red spots. The surface has a rough texture and is covered in granulations. This starfish can grow to a diameter of 2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 cm). Distribution Linckia multifora is circumtropical. It is found in the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, the western Pacific north to Japan, south to Lord Howe Island, east to the Pitcairn Islands, and northeast to Hawaii. Maps at World Register of Marine Species showing the distribution limited to the western Indian Ocean and at the Encyclopedia of Life showing an observation in the CaribbeanLinckia multifora Encyclopedia of Life. Retrieved 2018-06-09. seem to be incorrect. It is found on the sea floor at depths down to about 700 feet (213 metres) and favors coral reefs. Biology Linckia multifora exhibits autotomy (self amputation) and often sheds one or more arms. In this process, the arms become detached at various positions and each can grow into a new individual. This happens with such frequency that it is considered to be a means of asexual reproduction. Few individuals are found that do not exhibit some evidence of prior autotomy. In a study on Hawaii, it was found that the detachment of an arm is not caused by a sudden snap. Most fractures take place about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the disk. A small crack appears on the lower surface which spreads to adjacent parts, then the tube feet on the arm and the body pull the two parts of the animal in opposite directions. The event may take about one hour to complete. The damaged tissues take about 10 days to heal and the animal grows a new arm over the course of several months. The detached arm is known as a \\"comet\\" and moves about independently. It takes about 10 months to regenerate a new disk with arms 0.5 inch (1 cm) in length. When arms were severed into several parts in the laboratory, it was found that those over 0.5 inch (1 cm) in length were capable of regenerating including the tips of the arms and central sections with multiple injuries. Occasionally aberrant individuals developed with the wrong number of arms or with limbs in the wrong place. Parasitic snails are sometimes found in or on the body of this starfish. The snail Stylifer linckiae in the family Eulimidae has been shown to be a parasite by its uptake of materials from the seastar. Use in aquaria Linckia multifora is an omnivore but the diet in aquaria mostly consists of the bacterial surface films and sponges which are usually present in established tanks. This species is more tolerant of varying levels of pH, salinity and temperature than other Linckias but needs careful acclimatization at the time of introduction.Dalmatian Linckia Starfish Blue Zoo Aquatics.

The river and its course Kosasthalaiyar is long and originates near Pallipattu in Thiruvallur district and drains into the Bay of Bengal. Its northern tributary Nagari river originates in Chitoor district of Andhra Pradesh and joins the main river in the backwaters of Poondi reservoir. Its catchment area is spread over Vellore, Chitoor, North Arcot, Thiruvallur and Chennai districts. It has a catchment area in North Arcot District where it branches near Kesavaram Anicut and this tributary flows to the Chennai city as Cooum River, while the main river flows to the Poondi reservoir. From Poondi reservoir, the river flows through Thiruvallur District, enters the Chennai metropolitan area, and joins the sea at Ennore Creek. The river has 9 check dams. There are two check dams across the river at Tamaraipakkam and Vallur. The excess discharge in the river is controlled by the Tamarapakkam Anicut located across the river in the downstream of Poondi reservoir. Vallur Anicut is a small check dam constructed near Minjur across the river to control water levels and feed irrigation channels in the area. It flows to a distance of in the Chennai metropolitan area. The total catchment area of the river is , and the bed width ranges from . The discharge capacity of the river is , and the anticipated flood discharge capacity is about . The river drains up to of flood water into the sea through the Ennore Creek during monsoons. Galeru Nagari irrigation project is under execution to supply Krishna river water from Srisailam reservoir in Nagari basin of Chitoor district. Every year, whenever the floodgates of Poondi reservoir are opened, a considerable volume of water gets drained into the sea through the Kosasthalaiyar River near the Ennore Creek. Work on 10th check dam across the river is expected to by completed by the end of 2018 at a cost of 70 million. The structure would be 1.5 meters high, built across the 100-meter wide river. It would store water in the river for over 2 kilometers. Channels The historic Korattur anicut located at Jamin Korattur in Tiruvallur district serves as a vital channel to regulating water to the Chembarambakkam reservoir. The dam was built in 1876 across the unpolluted stretch of the Cooum river and diverts excess water to the Chembarambakkam reservoir. Restoration In 2011, the Water Resources Department (WRD) initiated the tendering process under the Irrigated Agriculture Modernisation and Waterbodies Restoration and Management (IAMWARM) project to rejuvenate nearly 200 lakes falling under Kosasthalaiyar river sub-basin. The department also proposes to construct groynes to reduce formation of sand bars near the mouth the river. In May 2012, the Water Resources Department (WRD) planned to construct a check dam across the river near Bandikavanur village in Tiruvallur district, about from Chennai, at a cost of 300 million. The Bandikavanur check dam, to be constructed about upstream of the Karanodai bridge on Chennai‚ÄìKolkata National Highway, would be constructed at a height of across the nearly wide river. The check dam would recharge the water table at a radius of . In 2018, two more check-dams were planned across the river. One of them will be located between Pudhukuppam and Kudiraipallam, downstream of Karanodai bridge. The dam will be built to a height of 1.2 meters across the river and the width will be nearly 335 meters, at a cost of 99 million. This will be the eighth check-dam built across the river. Another one will be built in Bandikavanur, about 30 km from Chennai. This will help recharge groundwater in a radius of 10 km.

On December 17, 2018, it was announced that Educational & Scientific, LLC (ESL), in conjunction with University of Maryland ventures, would develop the drug. Prostate cancer drug abiraterone and its analog Galaterone are Œî5,3Œ≤-hydroxy steroids. Structures of these two agents are identical to endogenous steroid substrates (cholesterole, dehydroepiandorosterone and pregnenolone) for the 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Œ≤HSD) of endocrine system. It has been reported that both of these agents are metabolized to 3-oxo-Œî4-steroids by 3Œ≤HSD in short period on oral administration. First metabolite 3-oxo-Œî4-abiraterone has more potent anti-prostate cancer properties than abiraterone where galeterone metabolite (3-oxo-Œî4-galaterone) has activity comparable to parent. Further these two metabolites undergo metabolism by 5Œ±-reductase (5Œ±-SRD) of endocrine system which leads to five more biologically inactive metabolites (Ref: Cell Chem. Biol. 2017, 24(7), 825; DOI: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2017.05.020). It is known that galeterone has poor oral bioavailability in rodents. Poor pharmacokinetic properties (oral absorption and metabolic half-life) of galeterone may be the reason for its clinical compromise. Galeterone, along with abiraterone acetate, has been identified as an inhibitor of sulfotransferases (SULT2A1, SULT2B1b, SULT1E1), which are involved in the sulfation of dehydroepiandrosterone and other steroids and compounds, with Ki values in the sub-micromolar range.

Biography Originally from Bergamo, he was a pupil of Giuseppe Diotti at the Accademia Carrara in the fourth decade of the 18th century and subsequently completed his training at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice, under the Neoclassical painter Odorico Politi and the set designer Francesco Bagnara. From his debut in 1839 he distinguished himself as a portraitist and painter of landscapes, which he showed at the 1844 Exposition of Fine Arts at the Carrara Academy in Bergamo. His presence is also documented in Florence and Rome, where he executed perspective views of the principal monuments in the cities, enlivened by scenes of everyday life. Around 1850 he settled in Udine, where he held a teaching post in the local arts and crafts school. His painting, which was in line with the canons of the academic tradition, soon gained favour with the Friuli aristocracy, who commissioned views of the city, as well as numerous portraits and still lifes with flowers. His prolific output continued into the 1870s, and his mature work was characterised by a more intense realism in the portraits that were not devoid of photographic effects. The use of photographs as a source of inspiration was a practice the artist was familiar with, thanks to his close friendship with Count Augusto Gabriele Agricola, one of the first to experiment with photography in Friuli.

United States Environmental Protection Agency, 566 U.S. 120 (2012), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that orders issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court ruled that because the Environmental Protection Agency's orders constitute \\"final agency action\\" under the Administrative Procedure Act, federal courts may hear appeals from its orders.  Background  The plaintiffs, Mike and Chantell Sackett, purchased, approximately, a two-thirds acre parcel of land (0.62) near Priest Lake, Idaho, on which they planned to build a house. Shortly after they began clearing the lot, the Sacketts received a Compliance Order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, asserting that the property was subject to the Clean Water Act, and that the Sacketts had illegally placed fill material into jurisdictional wetlands on their property. After trying unsuccessfully to obtain a hearing from the EPA, the Sacketts filed suit demanding an opportunity to contest the jurisdictional basis of the Compliance Order.Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Sackett v. EPA, No. 10-1062. Both the District CourtSackett v. EPA, 08-cv-185-N-EJL (Idaho Dist. 2008). and the Ninth Circuit Court of AppealsSackett v. EPA, 622 F.3d 1139 (9th Cir. 2010). ruled in favor of the government, holding that the validity of the Compliance Order could be challenged only if and when EPA brings an enforcement action seeking to impose civil and criminal penalties against the Sacketts. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, limited to the following questions: \\"1. May petitioners seek pre-enforcement judicial review of the administrative compliance order pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. ¬ß704? 2. If not, does petitioners' inability to seek preenforcement judicial review of the administrative compliance order violate their rights under the Due Process clause?\\"Supreme Court order dated June 28, 2011. The Sacketts, technically consulted by wetland experts Ray and Susan Kagel of Kagel Environmental, LLC,http://www.session.com/blog/2012/08/22/epa-drops-alleged- clean-water-act-violations-against-client-in-the-aftermath-of-the-watershed- united-states-supreme-court-cwa-case-sackett-v-the-united-states-of-america/ and represented by Damien M. Schiff of the Pacific Legal Foundation, filed their opening brief on September 23, 2011.Supreme Court Docket, Case No. 10-1062. Amicus briefs in support of the petitioners were filed by the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the National Association of Homebuilders. The opposition brief of the Solicitor General of the United States was filed on November 23, 2011. Opinion of the court In a unanimous opinion by Justice Scalia issued on March 21, 2012, the Court held that EPA's compliance orders may be challenged in a civil action brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The compliance orders are \\"final agency action\\" for purposes of the APA, and the Clean Water Act does not preclude judicial review under the APA. Justices Ginsburg and Alito each filed concurring opinions. Justice Ginsburg stated in her concurrence that the ruling only permitted the Sacketts to challenge EPA's assertion of jurisdiction over their property; the Court did not resolve whether the terms and conditions of the Compliance Order itself were subject to immediate judicial review. Justice Alito recommended that Congress act to clarify issues regarding the reach of the Clean Water Act. On May 3, 2012, the Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit remanded the Sacketts challenge to the compliance order to the district court, consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion. Decision after remand The United States District Court for the District of Idaho ruled against the Sackettes, finding that the area in question was a wetland and had been filled without necessary permits.

In one, inflorescences are produced after the first three pairs of leaves, when the plant is around tall; in the other, four or five pairs of leaves precede the inflorescence, by which time the plant is tall. The leaves are oppositely arranged, long and wide, and elliptic to ovate in shape. The inflorescences are composed of up to 7 flowers, and the corollas of the flowers are long. The stems are somewhat red-coloured, and have 4 to 6 prominent ribs running down from the leaf bases. Ecology The short form of S. genuflexa in fruit, showing the geocarpy that gives it its name Spigelia genuflexa grows in residual stands of Atlantic forest in the Rio do Negro valley in Bahia state (), at an altitude of , and about from the Atlantic coast. It flowers during the rainy season, and almost disappears during the dry season. It is able to self-pollinate, with anthesis lasting less than a day. After pollination, the plant stem bends, and in the lower growth form, deposits the seeds in the soil; the taller growth form remains some distance above the soil surface. Taxonomy Mendes Santos and Alex Popovkin in 2014 Spigelia genuflexa was discovered on land owned by Alex Popovkin in 2009, by Popovkin's \\"house help\\" Jos√© Carlos Mendes Santos. The specific epithet ' is a reference to the plant's tendency to bend down after flowering, from the Latin ' (cf. genuflexion). The authors proposed that the species should be listed as Data Deficient according to the criteria of the IUCN Red List. Popovkin is a Russian emigre and amateur botanist who has fulfilled a long-held dream to study plants in the tropics. It is one of sixty species which make up the poorly-studied Neotropical genus Spigelia, but does not appear particularly close to any other species.

Biography She was born in Milan. Her father, the landscape painter Giuseppe Bisi, had studied under the engraver Giuseppe Longhi; her mother was Ernesta Legnani. She apprenticed with her father, whose style and subjects she adopted in her early works. In 1842 she made her debut at the Esposizione di Belle Arti at the Brera Academy and assiduously participated in the following editions of the exhibition until 1859. Her uncle, Luigi Bisi, became president of the Academy in 1880. After being awarded a prize at the Brera Academy in 1845 for a large mountain landscape, she became established on the Milanese art scene as an heir to the Romantic Lombard tradition. She began to exhibit frequently and participated in the main shows in Turin, Parma and Florence, at the 1881 Esposizione Nazionale in Milan and in Venice in 1887, and was a notable success on the market. From the mid-1840s she began to break away from her father‚Äôs influence and produced a vast repertoire of Lombard and Ticinese views and landscapes influenced by the contemporary researches in a naturalistic key conducted by Giuseppe Canella. In her maturity she achieved a signature style characterised by a vibrant handling, consisting of short brushstrokes and a particular sensibility to the atmospheric and luministic values of landscape. At the 1880 Exhibition of Turin, she submitted a Monte Rosa veduto da Alagna e Valgonna (views of Lombardy). In 1881 in Turin, she exhibited a Park in Lombardy. At the 1887 Mostra Nazionale of Venice, she exhibited a Palude con effetto di temporale. Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis.

Rather than defining one specific algorithm, the standard defines a general model from which a variety of specific algorithms can be constructed. The model is based on a block cipher with a secret symmetric key. Because the standard describes a model rather than a specific algorithm, users of the standard must specify all of the particular options and parameter to be used, to ensure unambiguous MAC calculation. Model The model for MAC generation comprises six steps: # Padding of the data to a multiple of the cipher block size # Splitting of the data into blocks # Initial transformation of the first block of data # Iteration through the remaining blocks of data # Output transformation of the result of the last iteration # Truncation of the result to the required length For most steps, the standard provides several options from which to choose, and/or allows some configurability. =Padding= The input data must be padded to a multiple of the cipher block size, so that each subsequent cryptographic operation will have a complete block of data. Three padding methods are defined. In each case n is the block length (in bits): Padding method 1 If necessary, add bits with value 0 to the end of the data until the padded data is a multiple of n. (If the original data was already a multiple of n, no bits are added.) Padding method 2 Add a single bit with value 1 to the end of the data. Then if necessary add bits with value 0 to the end of the data until the padded data is a multiple of n. Padding method 3 The padded data comprises (in this order): * The length of the unpadded data (in bits) expressed in big-endian binary in n bits (i.e. one cipher block) * The unpadded data * As many (possibly none) bits with value 0 as are required to bring the total length to a multiple of n bits It is not necessary to transmit or store the padding bits, because the recipient can regenerate them, knowing the length of the unpadded data and the padding method used. =Splitting= The padded data D is split into q blocks D1, D2, ... Dq, each of length n, suitable for the block cipher. =Initial transformation= A cryptographic operation is performed on the first block (D1), to create an intermediate block H1. Two initial transformations are defined: Initial transformation 1 D1 is encrypted with the key K: :H1 = eK(D1) Initial transformation 2 D1 is encrypted with the key K, and then by a second key K‚Ä≤‚Ä≤: :H1 = eK‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(eK(D1)) =Iteration= Blocks H2 ... Hq are calculated by encrypting, with the key K, the bitwise exclusive-or of the corresponding data block and the previous H block. :for i = 2 to q ::Hi = eK(Di ‚äï Hi-1) If there is only one data block (q=1), this step is omitted. =Output transformation= A cryptographic operation is (optionally) performed on the last iteration output block Hq to produce the block G. Three output transformations are defined: Output transformation 1 Hq is used unchanged: :G = Hq Output transformation 2 Hq is encrypted with the key K‚Ä≤: :G = eK‚Ä≤(Hq) Output transformation 3 Hq is decrypted with the key K‚Ä≤ and the result encrypted with the key K: :G = eK(dK‚Ä≤(Hq)) =Truncation= The MAC is obtained by truncating the block G (keeping the leftmost bits, discarding the rightmost bits), to the required length. Specific algorithms The general model nominally allows for any combination of options for each of the padding, initial transformation, output transformation, and truncation steps. However, the standard defines four particular combinations of initial and output transformation and (where appropriate) key derivation, and two further combinations based on duplicate parallel calculations. The combinations are denoted by the standard as \\"MAC Algorithm 1\\" through \\"MAC Algorithm 6\\". =MAC algorithm 1= This algorithm uses initial transformation 1 and output transformation 1. Only one key is required, K. (When the block cipher is DES, this is equivalent to the algorithm specified in FIPS PUB 113 Computer Data Authentication.) Algorithm 1 is commonly known as CBC-MAC.ISO/IEC 9797-1:2011 Information technology ‚Äì Security techniques ‚Äì Message Authentication Codes (MACs) ‚Äì Part 1: Mechanisms using a block cipher, Introduction =MAC algorithm 2= This algorithm uses initial transformation 1 and output transformation 2. Two keys are required, K and K‚Ä≤, but K‚Ä≤ may be derived from K. =MAC algorithm 3= This algorithm uses initial transformation 1 and output transformation 3. Two independent keys are required, K and K‚Ä≤. Algorithm 3 is also known as Retail MAC. =MAC algorithm 4= This algorithm uses initial transformation 2 and output transformation 2. Two independent keys are required, K and K‚Ä≤, with a third key K‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ derived from K‚Ä≤. =MAC algorithm 5= MAC algorithm 5 comprises two parallel instances of MAC algorithm 1. The first instance operates on the original input data. The second instance operates on two key variants generated from the original key via multiplication in a Galois field. The final MAC is computed by the bitwise exclusive-or of the MACs generated by each instance of algorithm 1. Algorithm 5 is also known as CMAC. =MAC algorithm 6= This algorithm comprises two parallel instances of MAC algorithm 4. The final MAC is the bitwise exclusive-or of the MACs generated by each instance of algorithm 4.ISO/IEC 9797-1:1999 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Message Authentication Codes (MACs) -- Part 1: Mechanisms using a block cipher Superseded by ISO/IEC 9797-1:2011, which (according to the latter's Foreword) has a different algorithm 6. Each instance of algorithm 4 uses a different key pair (K and K‚Ä≤) but those four keys are derived from two independent base keys. Key derivation MAC algorithms 2 (optionally), 4, 5 and 6 require deriving one or more keys from another key. The standard does not mandate any particular method of key derivation, although it does generally mandate that derived keys be different from each other. The standard gives some examples of key derivation methods, such as \\"complement alternate substrings of four bits of K commencing with the first four bits.\\" This is equivalent to bitwise exclusive-oring each byte of the key with F0 (hex). Complete specification of the MAC calculation To completely and unambiguously define the MAC calculation, a user of ISO/IEC 9797-1 must select and specify: * The block cipher algorithm e * The padding method (1 to 3) * The specific MAC algorithm (1 to 6) * The length of the MAC * The key derivation method(s) if necessary, for MAC algorithms 2, 4, 5 or 6 Security analysis of the algorithms Annex B of the standard is a security analysis of the MAC algorithms. It describes various cryptographic attacks on the algorithms ‚Äì including key-recovery attack, brute force key recovery, and birthday attack ‚Äì and analyses the resistance of each algorithm to those attacks.

ARMS., (26 November 1911 in Aberdeen - 24 August 1982 in Tirinie, Blair Athol, Perthshire) was a Scottish artist who came to public attention in 2011 for his many contemporaneous drawings of his life as a prisoner of war during the Japanese occupation of Singapore and Thailand in World War II. The drawings were made in secret depicting scenes of daily life and personalities in the camps in Singapore and Thailand, working on the Death railway. They also uniquely documented the Selarang Square Squeeze when some 17,000 prisoners were forced to crowd in the barracks square for nearly five days with little water and no sanitation until they signed a 'promise not to escape'.Back from Hell - John George Mennie - Artist and Prisoner of War Mennie's drawings were donated to the archive at the Imperial War Museum, but came to wider public notice when a selection from a separate source were featured on an episode of the BBC television programme Antiques Roadshow, filmed on 18 September 2011 at Manchester. Early life John Mennie was born at 28 Clarence Street, Aberdeen, Scotland, on 26 November 1911 to Robert and Margaret Mennie. He was known to family and friends as Jack. He trained at Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen and at Westminster School of Art in London. After graduation he worked as a commercial artist in London for eight years until he enlisted in the army in 1940.Back from Hell, John Mennie, Biography WWII - Singapore and Thailand Mennie joined the Royal Artillery in 1940 and was posted in September 1941 to Singapore. ( No 1604539 in the 2nd Highland A.A. regiment, H.K.S.R.A. ) By the time of his capture on 15 February 1942 he had been promoted to Lance Bombardier. He was captured when Singapore surrendered to the Japanese forces in February 1942 and he was a prisoner of war until August 1945. He was demobbed in 1946 and returned to Aberdeen.Japanese POW Index Card Mennie described his 4-year PoW itinerary in a part of a letter to his mother written at Pratchi camp, Thailand, 5 September 1946.John Mennie's first letter to his mother after 4 years PoW. Thailand, 5 September 1946. He was in Changi, Singapore, from February until October 1942, when he was transferred to Thailand on 5 day rail journey, arriving on 3 November. Then after a 6-day voyage on a barge up the Mae Klong river from Kontonburi was dumped on the side of a mountain with jungle starting from the bank. They had to clear a space and build a camp from the material around them, bamboo. At 'Kano' their task was to build 10 miles of railway along the mountain. He noted that of the 600 men, 125 were dead within 6 months. He left Kano camp in August 1943 and went to Chungkai,Chungkai Cemetery memorial 2 miles from Konton buri until May 1944. He was then moved to Nakom Paton,Nakom Paton memorial a place that he cheerfully described to his mother as [ having ] the second largest Buddhist temple in the world. In January 1945 he was moved 'up country' to a camp called Tamawan. In May 1945 he was moved again, a 6-day journey to Pratchi camp where the prisoners had to tunnel into a mountain to make bomb proof magazines for ammunition. =Secret drawings= Mennie was one of a few brave prisoners that recorded life in the Japanese POW camps at great risk to themselves. Others included Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky, Ashley George Old and Ronald Searle. Mennie created two series of secret drawings while he in the camps: * a documentary series detailing Japanese barbarity and the conditions endured by prisoners. He secreted these in the stem of a bamboo walking stick; * a set of eighty sketch portraits of his comrades which he secreted under the piece of wood on which he kept his mess tin. These were eventually discovered by the Japanese, removed, stolen back from the Japanese camp office, made their way back to the UK and were posted to his mother's address in Aberdeen. His meagre materials were pen, pencil, scraps of paper and card including 'white space' torn from manuals, plus a Chinese 'Children's watercolour paintbox'.Aberdeen Weekly Journal 11 April 1946 Mennie's drawings in the camps include: * Selerang Square Squeeze, Singapore, September 1942.

Ching-Kai POW Camp, Thai-Burma Railway =Imperial War Museum= Mennie created many drawings during his time as a prisoner of war, and in 1978 over fifty pieces were donated to the archives in the Imperial War Museum, London. Art and teaching career After graduation from the Westminster School of Art in circa 1931 he worked as a commercial artist in London for eight years until he enlisted in the army in 1940. In 1947, after his demobbed from the army, Mennie started teaching life drawing and painting at the Marylebone Institute of Adult Education, later run by the Inner London Education Authority. He also ran an 'art stall' at Nicolls Antique Market in Portobello Road. Mennie was a member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters Sculptors and Gravers.Back from Hell - Gallery of portraits by John Mennie Personal life He met Dorothy (Bertha Dorothy Linter Cole) when she enrolled at one of his evening classes at the Marylebone Institute of Adult Education, and she became an accomplished artist.

Biography Pompeo Borra was born in Milan His studies were varied: first he attended technical schools and then, briefly, the course in decoration at the Scuola degli Artefici at the Brera Academy. After fighting as a volunteer in World War I, he returned to Milan, where he made his debut at the Famiglia Artistica in 1920. In 1924, he participated in the Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte in Venice arousing the critics‚Äô interest with his severe language deriving from the Quattrocento characterised by solid volumes and suspended, unreal atmospheres. His archaic style drew him to the Novecento Italiano and from 1926 on he took part in all the group‚Äôs shows. In 1928, he showed works in the major exhibition of Italian art, curated by Franz Roh, the theorist of Magical Realism and German Neue Sachlichkeit. During the 1930s, he renewed his pictorial language by adopting a lighter and more luminous range of colours, without, however, abandoning the solid volumes of his figures. With the paintings of this period, his reputation as an artist became firmly established and he won the Principe Umberto Prize in 1934. Between 1936 and 1939, he made frequent stays in Paris where he came into contact with the art dealer L√©once Rosenberg, director of the gallery L‚ÄôEffort Moderne and promoter of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. At this time his painting was influenced by contemporary researches on abstract art resulting in a limited number of geometric works. This was followed by a vast output in which the artist did not abandon figuration and painted mainly female portraits and landscapes. Different variations on these subjects were frequently produced throughout his mature period, which is distinguished by an intense research on colour, applied in broad flat fields using tones that deliberately clash, and on the simplification of the form within a two- dimensional space. He began teaching art in 1948, first at a secondary school and then at the Brera Academy, where he was appointed director in 1970. He died in Milan in 1973.

Remo Brindisi (25 April 1918 ‚Äì 25 July 1996) was an Italian painter. Biography Born in Rome, Brindisi was trained by his father, a skilled wood carver, in Pescara and L‚ÄôAquila. Having attended the Experimental Centre of Stage Design in Rome for a short period during 1935, he obtained a grant to study at the Institute of Book Decoration and Illustration in Urbino, where he specialized in graphic art and printmaking and served a professional apprenticeship as an illustrator. He came into contact with Ardengo Soffici and Ottone Rosai in Florence in 1940 and held his first solo show there, with a presentation by Eugenio Montale. The period from 1943 to 1946, which he spent in Venice, saw the start of large-scale involvement in exhibitions and constant participation in the Rome Quadrennial and the Venice Biennial as well as connections with the major private galleries of Milan and Venice. As a result of a move to Milan, the post-war period saw a short phase marked by the influence of Cubist painting as interpreted in an expressionistic and existential sense. Brindisi formed the Gruppo di Linea together with Gianni Dova and Ibrahim Kodra and was later associated with the realist movement, while maintaining, however, complete autonomy with respect to the major artistic trends of the age. His focus on issues of social commitment and protest culminated in the period 1960‚Äì61 with a series of large paintings devoted to the history of Fascism, in which figurative painting of an expressionist character was combined with an approach modelled on the examples of Art Informel. The 1970s and ‚Äô80s saw the continuation of the same repertoire distinguished by intense and violent colour and characteristically flattened figures in two-dimensional space. Brindisi was director of the Macerata Academy of Fine Arts from 1981 to 1983, and president of the Milan Trienniale in 1972. He died at Lido di Spina in 1996.

It has evolved as an effective means of ensuring a suitable environment for the plant's offspring. Geocarpy is also linked with solifluction soils, where rapid thawing and freezing of surface soil causes almost continuous movement. This phenomenon is prevalent in high altitude areas of East Africa. In order to reproduce, geocarpic plants bend their stems so that the fruit can be embedded in the soil during the freezing process while the fruit is still attached to the plant itself. Geocarpy is most frequent in tropical or semi-desert areas, and geocarpic species may be found in the families Araceae, Begoniaceae, Brassicaceae (Cruciferae), Callitrichaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae (Leguminosae), Loganiaceae, Moraceae and Rubiaceae. The best-known example is the peanut, Arachis hypogaea.

It is made of gold with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, enamel and pearls. Its height and diameter are both . The crown has been a property of the House of Wittelsbach since 1402, when it came with Princess Blanche of England, daughter of King Henry IV of England, on her marriage to Louis III, Elector Palatine.Cherry (1987), p. 203. After the junior Bavarian branch of the house became extinct in the male line in 1777, the senior Palatine branch replaced the former as the country's rulers. Today, the crown is displayed in the treasury of the Munich Residenz, where it has been kept since 1782. It has been described as \\"one of the finest achievements of the Gothic goldsmith\\".Cherry (1987), p. 202. Description The crown is made up of 12 hexagonal rosettes on the base each supporting a gold stem topped by a lily. The stems and lilies alternate in size and height. They are heavily jewelled versions of the fleur de lys (lily flower) that was popular for medieval crowns.Cherry (1987), pp. 202‚Äì203. In the middle of the hexagons, which have enamelled white flowers overlaid onto a translucent blue or red background, is a pale blue sapphire, 11 of which are oval and 1 is hexagonal. Each point is decorated with alternating rubies and clusters of four pearls that have a small diamond at the centre. In addition to diamonds, pearls, and sapphires, the lilies are also decorated with emeralds.Gray, pp. 431‚Äì432. Some of the original pearls may have been replaced when the crown was restored in 1925. The lily stems are detachable, and it is possible to fold the crown's base so that it can be transported more easily. Each rosette is numbered 1‚Äì12 to make sure the lilies are re-attached correctly. The crown is in both height and diameter.  History  Detail of two hexagons mounted on the base with alternating arrangements of jewels and pearls The nuptial crown is first documented in the inventory of King Richard II of England as having 12 fleurons, but a rosette was missing. At the time, it was decorated with 91 pearls, 63 balas rubies, 47 sapphires, 33 diamonds, and 5 emeralds. An additional 7 pearls and 1 emerald had been taken off the fleurons. The crown weighed 5 marks 7 oz, or just under 1 kilogram, and was valued at ¬£246 13s 4d. It was recorded again in a 1399 list of royal jewels being moved across London which had been owned by the deposed Richard II and others. Therefore, the crown had most likely belonged to Queen Anne of Bohemia, the wife of Richard II, whom she married in 1382. It may have been produced in Bohemia, but elements such as beading on the stems suggest Paris, though the maker might have been a French or French-trained goldsmith working in Prague. Venice has also been suggested as the crown's place of origin.Cherry (2011), p. 61. The crown came to the Palatine line of the House of Wittelsbach as dowry of Blanche of England, daughter of King Henry IV of England. After his accession to the English throne, Henry wanted to make important alliances in order to maintain and legitimize his rule. One ally whose support he hoped to gain was the Wittelsbach King Rupert of Germany, who also took the German throne after the deposition of King Wenceslaus. A marriage between Rupert's eldest surviving son, Louis, and Henry IV's eldest daughter, Blanche, was soon arranged. On 7 March 1401, the marriage contract was signed in London, and the bride's dowry was fixed at 40,000 nobles. In 1402, prior to the wedding of Blanche and Louis III, it was restored by a London goldsmith, who added a twelfth rosette and replaced the missing emerald and pearls on the fleurons. The new rosette contained 12 pearls, 3 diamonds, 3 balas rubies, and 1 sapphire. In total, of gold were added to the crown.Stratford, p. 260. Blanche wore the crown at her wedding, which took place on 6 July 1402 at Cologne Cathedral in Germany.Harlow, p. 143. In 1421, it was pawned to Maulbronn Monastery, and by that time several gems and pearls had been taken out.Stratford, pp. 260‚Äì262. In 1988, the crown featured in the Age of Chivalry exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London ‚Äì the first time it had returned to England since 1401.Gray, p. 431.

An Irish- Scottish mercenary army, led by Donnell Gorm MacDonnell of Carey and Alexander Carragh MacDonnell of Glenarm, sons of the deceased James MacDonald, 6th of Dunnyveg, were invited into Connacht by the Burkes to attack English settlements and forces. The mercenary army was fronted at Sligo, Coolony and Ballingafad by English forces for over fourteen days. Sir Richard Bingham, governor of Connacht, followed the mercenary force to Ardnaree, where the mercenary force had camped on the east (right) bank of the River Moy. Bingham's forces surrounded the camp at night and attacked the occupants. During the battle 1,000 mercenaries were killed, including Donnell Gorm MacDonnell of Carey and Alexander Carragh MacDonnell of Glenarm. Also slaughtered were some 1000 men, women and children in the camp.

The generic name derives from the Greek trichos/œÑœÅŒπœáŒøœÇ 'hair' and loma/ŒªœâŒºŒ± 'hem', 'fringe' or 'border'. It lies within the section terrea within the subgenus Tricholoma within the genus Tricholoma. Description Tricholoma orirubens has a dark grey or grey-brown cap up to in diameter with darker blackish scales, and a straight or undulating margin. The cap is conical with a slight boss before opening and flattening, eventually with either a boss or central depression. The thick grey gills are emarginate or adnate and widely spaced, and turn red when bruised. The white or pale grey ringless stipe measures 4.5 to 8 cm tall and 0.7 to 2.5 cm wide, and has a distinctive blue tinged base. Distribution and habitat Widespread across Europe, Tricholoma orirubens is not common. It is rare in the Netherlands. Found singly or in small groups in deciduous and coniferous woodland in autumn, it prefers clayey or chalky soils. It is ectomycorrhizal. Tricholoma orirubens can also form fairy rings. One found in Germany had a diameter of around and contained an estimated 10,000 mushrooms.

Biography Of humble origin, Pasinetti served his apprenticeship with the local painter Luigi Campini in Brescia. After attending the Moretto school there, he moved to Milan in 1880 and enrolled at the Brera Academy, where he graduated in drawing. Dissatisfaction with the academic teaching may have been the reason why he abandoned his studies and moved to Verona to attend the school of the painter Napoleone Nani, a practitioner of the new naturalistic approach. He travelled through northern Italy and specialized in landscape and portrait painting until 1889, when he settled definitively in Milan. There he came into contact with the leading figures of the Lombard school of naturalism and shared a studio on Via Solferino with Paolo Troubetzkoy. He was established by the end of the 20th century as a portrait painter with a middle-class clientele in Lombardy while continuing to paint landscapes during his frequent travels and stays in Italy and other countries, with a particular preference for Venice. His strongly naturalistic painting took a new course around 1925 as a result of contact with the Novecento Italiano movement. Pasinetti took part in the major national and international exhibitions from 1884 on. Giovanni Treccani degli Alfieri organized a show of his work in Milan in 1942, two years after his death.

Background Kamrupi brahmins are those brahmins who claimed their descent from the Kanauji immigrant brahmins of a very early period. They settled in Kamrup and later on spread out. Rites and rituals Many rituals followed by Kamrupi Brahmins are unique to their community. During a ritual named Amati, mother earth is believed passing through menstrual period and thus to be in an unclean state. Hence on those days farmers would not till the soil or plant any seeds. Orthodox widows and Brahmins abstain from any food except fruits. Devi, a special synthesized form of both Durga of the Hindu pantheon and a tribal female deity, is still being worshiped in Cooch Behar. Worship of Devi is generally performed by a Kamrupi Brahmin of North Bengal. History Kamrupi Brahmins were prosperous during the Varman dynasty's reign of Kamarupa. The Kamrupi king Bhaskaravarman regularly gave land grants to the Kamrupi Brahmins. With these land grants they were also given copper plates grants.Rup Kumar Barman (2007), Contested regionalism: a new look on the history, cultural change, and regionalism of North Bengal and Lower Assam, Abhijeet Publications, p.200 The Copper Plate Grants of Bargaon and Sualkuchi Grant of Ratnapal prove the land grants to the Brahmins at the banks of the Lohita and the Kalang,respectively.

Biography He was born in Verona and studied sporadically at the Cignaroli Academy of Fine Arts there, while practising as a copyist and restorer in the studio of the fresco painter Pietro Nanin. Ferrari made his debut at the 1837 exhibition at the Verona Academy with a series of views of the city enlivened by genre episodes inspired by Flemish painting. These would become typical subjects in the most successful part of his repertoire. During the 1840s he received increasing public and critical acclaim, which coincided with his participating more frequently in exhibitions, such as the one at the Academy in Venice in 1839 and at the Brescia Atheneum in 1840 and the Esposizione di Belle Arti at the Brera Academy in Milan in 1844, and also established himself as one of the leading Veronese painters during the Restoration period. He received important commissions from the local nobility and the Austrian officers based in Verona thanks to his being in favour with Field Marshal Radetzky, for whom his views of the Venetian Lagoon inspired by the 18th-century veduta model were mainly destined. The artist‚Äôs international fame and market appeal reached their height around 1851, following Emperor Franz Josef‚Äôs visit to his studio which guaranteed him an international clientele of the highest order. During his late period he was highly active as a painter and engraver, specialising in the interpretation of Renaissance works, and he also became a connoisseur by working closely with the Veronese collector Cesare Bernasconi.

Retrieved 25 September 2011. Mogens Prip-Buus, one of Utzon's closest colleagues, reports that the term was coined in 1965 in Utzon's Sydney office when, after a discussion of the social structures in Britain and Denmark, Utzon suddenly jumped up and wrote \\"Additive Architecture\\" on the wall. He saw it as part of an additive world where both natural and cultural forms contributed to additive systems and hierarchies. He realized that his own architecture reflected the same principle, just as the transitions in primitive societies between family, village and the surrounding world have visible links revealing differences, relations and distances.Thomas Bo Jensen, \\"Om bogen Additive Architecture\\", Forlaget Ehrhorn Hummerston, published in Arkitekten, Vol 111, no. 14, November 2009. Retrieved 7 October 2011. Utzon observed the additive approach in Chinese temples whose stacked timber structures are basically identical, differing only with the size of the building. In his \\"Additive Architecture\\" manifesto in 1970, he tells us how he saw the phenomenon reflected in a group of deer at the edge of a forest or in the pebbles on a beach, convincing him that buildings should be designed more freely rather than in identical box shapes. Earlier, in 1948, he had expressed the same ideas in an essay titled \\"The Innermost Being of Architecture\\" stating: \\"Something of the naturalness found in the growth principle in nature ought to be a fundamental idea in works of architecture.\\"Thomas Bo Jensen, \\"Review of Additive Architecture\\" , Edition Bl√∏ndal. Retrieved 25 September 2011. The application of the additive approach can be seen in many of Utzon's works including the courtyard housing schemes which began with the Kingo Houses, the tiling of the Sydney Opera House and his designs for a sports complex in Jeddah. Utzon's early competition project for a crematorium in 1945 also exemplifies his approach. The building's free-standing walls could be extended over time, a new brick being added for each cremation.Adrian Carter, \\"Between Earth and Sky: The work of J√∏rn Utzon, as an exemplary phenomenological approach to modern architecture made concrete.\\" Retrieved 25 September 2011. Examples of the Additive Architecture approach in Utzon's work can also be seen in his designs for the unbuilt Silkeborg Museum, the Farum Town Centre proposal, the Herning expansion plan including a \\"school town\\" and the flexible Espansiva approach for low-cost housing which only resulted in a prototype. Perhaps the best example of all is the proposal for a major sports centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, based on the use of a limited number of repeating elements.Richard Weston: Utzon ‚Äî Inspiration, Vision, Architecture, Hellerup, Denmark: Edition Bl√∏ndal, 2002, pp 248‚Äì277.

Biography Alinari was born in Florence. Self-taught, he made his debut in 1968 with his first one-man show at the Galleria Inquadrature in Florence. During the 1970s he began an intense research on the free juxtaposition of objects and figures within a fantastical and suspended atmosphere, influenced by Neo-Dada and Pop Art research. During those years he experimented with various pictorial techniques, combining fluorescent colours, decalcomania, collage and photographic transpositions. Between 1972 and 1973 he exhibited in the main private galleries in Florence, presented by his friend the poet Alfonso Gatto. During the 1980s he gained official recognition through his participation in the 40th Venice Biennale (1982) and in the 11th Rome Quadriennale (1985). In 1993 he had his first retrospective mounted at the Royal Palace of Milan Museum, where he showed a group of works spanning his whole artistic career. The exhibition signalled the beginning of his series of fantastical landscapes characterised by bright, vivid colours and a pictorial technique combining thickly applied pigment with refined fields of smooth, transparent colour. Luca Alinari died in Florence on March 15, 2019 at the age of 76.

Without abandoning his realist style of painting, during the 1920s, he developed a more solid and synthetic rendering of form, influenced by the contemporary researches of the Novecento Italiano group, which he joined after the first Milan exhibition in 1926. After his debut in the Esposizione Nazionale d‚ÄôArte, held at the Palazzo della Permanente in Milan in 1927, he began to exhibit regularly from 1928 onwards in the Venice Biennale and all the principal, official exhibitions in Italy and abroad. He gained extensive recognition through his vast repertoire of portraits, female figures and still lifes as well as his notable production of landscapes, in which he combines the severe language of the 20th century with studies from life. After being appointed director of the Carrara Academy in Bergamo in 1931, he played a pivotal role in the cultural renewal of the city and he executed a mural for the Casa Littoria \\"A.

It is located on the wavy terrain of the Bubanj zone, about 4.5 km southwest of the center of Nis. According to the 2002 census, there were 2,139 inhabitants (according to the 1991 census there were 1705 inhabitants). In the settlement there are separate classes of all grades of the primary school Kralj Petar Prvi. History Passy Poljana is old, but in the Middle Ages, a village was formed, since the Turkish census was recorded in 1498 as Pasi Pola, with 21 houses, 5 unmarried and 1 widowed house, and with duties of 3.233 aces. According to the Turkish census of the Nakhije of Nis from 1516, the place was one of the 111 villages of Nahije and it was named Pasje Polje, and it had 19 houses, 3 widowed households, and 5 single households. [1] In the later times, the village dies and occasionally comes down to the status of a mezra. At the beginning of the 19th century, embossing the boots from various parts, it is renewed by the Spahija Stabeg. Turƒçin set himself a house (tower) in the present-day Economic Valley, in the quest for Crkviste, and tried to seize the peasants of the village around them. Thus in the Economic valley, in some parts of it, the ancestors of today's Savinac, Kosutin, Mrstinac and Nizin originate from Leskovac region. For these, in the 19th century, newcomers from Pirot (Ad≈æijina) and Svrlji≈°ki region (Denƒçini, Red≈æini and ≈Ωiviƒái) and others were settled. Prior to liberation from the Turks, with 36 houses, he managed Ali-aga from Djakovica. In 1878, the village had 36 households and 302 inhabitants. In the period of Serbia and inter-Yugoslav Yugoslavia, it gradually loses its natural characteristics, focusing on market and suburban agriculture. In 1930, there were 105 households and 720 inhabitants. The development after 1945 caused, on the one hand, the relocation or gradual dislocation of the settlement towards Nis, while the proximity of the city, on the other hand, attracted newcomers from other villages. At the same time there was a significant economic and social restructuring of the population (in 1971 there were 32 agricultural, 104 mixed and 158 non-agricultural households). On this basis, Passi Poljana lost the traditional rural features (though not the traditional rural organization of the settlement) already in the 1960s, and was first mixed, then from 1975/80. year and city hallmarks as a peripheral workers' settlement Nis. Demography In the village of Pasi Poljana there are 1663 adult inhabitants, and the average age of the population is 38.7 years (38.6 in males and 38.8 in females). In the settlement there are 936 households, and the average number of members per household is 3.14. This settlement was largely inhabited by Serbs (according to the 2002 census), and in the last three censuses, there was an increase in the number of inhabitants.

They may be made of durable plastic or culinary parchment. A bag helps to keep the food being cooked moist by trapping the moisture in the bag and preventing it from escaping into the oven; as such, it serves a similar purpose to basting. The plastic used for manufacture of the oven bag must be chosen so that it will not melt at the temperature during cooking and thus spoil the food. To this end, many oven bags are formed from a heat-resistant nylon or polyester. The inventor of the plastic-based cooking bag is Gordon Lawry. However, Mr. Lawry was working for a company at the time and received payment of approximately 15 cents. Oven bags should be carefully placed so that the bag does not come in contact with any hot surfaces in the oven, such as heating elements or oven racks. These may cause the bag to melt, smoke, or catch fire. in 1998, a study measured the migration of non-volatile and volatile compounds from oven bags to chicken. As much as 16% of the nylon from microwave and roasting bags were observed in the chicken after roasting at 200C for 2 hours and as much as .08% of the total 2-cyclopentyl cyclopentanone content in the bags were observed.

Biography Introduced to painting by his brother Auguste, the leading spirit of an art school in P√©ronne, he subsequently became a pupil of the painter and illustrator Th√©ophile Fragonard. A portraitist and painter of history and genre paintings he made his debut at the Paris Salon in 1836 and was awarded a third class medal. An important exponent of an academic culture linked to official circles, he worked for the Versailles galleries in particular. In 1848 when commissions declined he was forced to move to England. He participated regularly in the exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London with a series of miniature portraits and, in 1851, with two history paintings. After returning to Paris in 1852, he exhibited at the Salon until 1890 with a vast repertoire of genre scenes of historical inspiration that were very successful commercially, as well as portraits and religious subjects that were stylistically similar to those of his teacher. He became famous on the international art scene from the 1850s onwards, following his participation in some of the major exhibitions of the time including the national Ghent Triennial Salon of 1853 and 1865, the 1865 Porto International Exhibition and the 1st International Exhibition of Fine Arts in Munich in 1869. The Italian landscape shown at the Exhibition of Fine Arts in Lille in 1866, suggests that the artist was in Italy before that date, though sources traditionally date his stay to between 1869 and 1871.

Biography Encouraged in his artistic studies by his father Giuseppe who was an engraver, he enrolled at the Brera Academy in 1896 and became a pupil of Giuseppe Mentessi, Vespasiano Bignami and Cesare Tallone. He made his debut at the 4th Esposizione Triennale di Brera in 1900 with two landscape studies and began to participate regularly in the exhibitions held at the Famiglia Artistica Milanese and the Societ√† per le Belle Arti ed Esposizione Permanente, becoming established on the art scene in 1906 through his participation in the Esposizione Internazionale di Milano. From the 1920s on, he distinguished himself as a protagonist in the Milanese cultural coteries, being one of the leading lights of the Associazione degli Acquarellisti Lombardi and of the Famiglia Artistica Milanese, and he was awarded a gold medal at the exhibition devoted to the Lombard landscape in 1926. From the outset his cityscapes and landscapes are characterised by broken brushstrokes and a light, transparent palette, which was to become his signature style. In the 1940s, when he took up painting again after the long hiatus due to World War II, he reprised his repertoire of Milanese and Venetian views, which had now become repetitive and conventional, using a looser and more fluid pictorial technique.

This production is Gilbert's first talking film, but it was not released until months after the premiere of His Glorious Night, his second \\"talkie\\". Redemption is based on the 1918 Broadway play of the same title by Arthur Hopkins, who in turn based his work on the play The Living Corpse by Leo Tolstoy and first staged in Moscow in 1911.Alpert, Hollis (1964). The Barrymores. New York City: Dial Press, 1964, pp. 178-179.Munden, Kenneth W. (ed). The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30. Washington, D.C.: AFI, 1971. Plot Living in Russia in the early 1900s, Fedya Protasoff (John Gilbert) is a handsome, self-indulgent womanizer who continues to squander his family inheritance drinking and gambling. He meets and falls in love with Lisa (Eleanor Boardman), the fianc√©e of his friend Victor Karenin (Conrad Nagel). Soon he lures her away from Victor and marries her. After a year together, Lisa has their child, a boy; but after another year of marriage, Fedya tires of the monotony of home life and resumes his profligate ways. He is tortured by his conscience for mistreating Lisa, but he fails to reform his behavior. Finally, his reckless social life results in gambling debts so large that he is forced to sell his estate. Despite Fedya's deplorable actions, Victor displays an act of enduring friendship and helps him by purchasing the estate at auction for the greatly inflated price of 125,000 rubles. While his marriage to Lisa continues to crumble, Fedya becomes infatuated with a young \\"Gypsy\\" woman, Masha (Ren√©e Ador√©e), and they begin living together in a \\"cheap boarding house\\". This leads him to make a final break with Lisa by sending her a suicide note and then faking his death. Masha assists him in the ruse by placing some of his clothes and his \\"pocketbook\\" on a riverbank. Fedya then goes into hiding, leaving family members and friends to conclude that he had deliberately drowned himself since they knew he could not swim. The deception is further enhanced by sheer coincidence when authorities a week later pull out of the river the body of another man who had actually drowned there. Lisa is brought in by police to identify the badly decomposed corpse. Terribly distressed and certain that Fedya had carried out his suicide note, she barely looks at the \\"horror\\" and hastily affirms that the remains are those of her husband. Long-suffering Lisa now marries Victor. Fedya's deceit, however, is eventually discovered, and he is arrested for fraud. His arrest also draws Lisa and Victor into court on charges of bigamy. The couple professes their innocence and insist that they truly believed Fedya was dead before they married. When Feyda enters the court to testify, he is a broken man emotionally as well as physically. He confesses that he had indeed faked his death and insists too that Lisa and his former friend are blameless. Confronted with his duplicity and with the guilt that he is continuing to destroy any hope of happiness for Lisa and Victor, he has an associate, Petushkov (Nigel De Brulier), bring him a pistol outside the courthouse. With the weapon tucked inside his coat, Fedya watches Lisa, Victor, and others file past him and walk down the building's front steps. He then quietly says, \\"I'll pass on\\" and shoots himself. Horrified, Lisa screams and rushes to Fedya, cradling him in her arms. As he dies, he asks for forgiveness, calls for Masha, and utters his final word, \\"happiness\\".  Cast  * John Gilbert as Fedya * Ren√©e Ador√©e as Masha * Eleanor Boardman as Lisa * Conrad Nagel as Victor * Claire McDowell as Anna Pavlovna * Nigel De Brulier as PetushkovThe actor Augustin Borgato is credited on screen as Fedya's friend Petushkov, but in the film De Brulier is called Petushkov in the tavern and again outside the courtroom in the story's final scenes.

The paper reports in its March 4, 1929 issue that he \\"will make [a] silent version of Redemption, first, after which a talker version will be made.\\" It also announces, \\"The film stars John Gilbert, marking the M-G-M star's first appearance in a talker.\\"\\"Niblo Plans Silent Version First\\", news item, The Film Daily (New York City), March 4, 1929, p. 7.

That length of time suggests that Niblo was working on both silent and sound versions, but at some point during that period MGM canceled the former and committed to only completing a talkie. *Despite several months of filming, editing, and readjusting recorded dialogue, MGM remained dissatified with the results. The studio even enlisted Lionel Barrymore to redirect some scenes as part of a \\"salvage attempt\\".Kotsilibas-Davis, James. The Barrymores: The Royal Family in Hollywood. New York: Crown Publishers, 1981, p. 84. Nevertheless, while the film was set for release either in the late summer or early autumn in 1929, it was instead \\"shelved after failing to impress studio executives\\".Kotsilibas- Davis, p. 84. Release By February 1930, a full year after production started on the film, studio personnel and other Hollywood insiders, including reporters and writers for trade publications and popular fan magazines, were aware that MGM executives clearly had problems with the overall quality of Redemption and had postponed the film's release until well after the premiere of His Glorious Night, Gilbert's second screen project with recorded dialogue.Albert, Katherine (1930). \\"Is Jack Gilbert Through?\\", Photoplay (Chicago, Illinois), February 1930, pp. 29, 128-129. Internet Archive. Retrieved October 18, 2019. His Glorious Night opened on September 28, 1929, six months before the release of Redemption. The February issue of Photoplay includes a feature article by Katherine Albert titled \\"Is Jack Gilbert Through?\\" In her article, Albert speculates why Redemption, which she refers to as a \\"sorry affair\\", was \\"temporarily shelved\\" and still not released by early 1930. She contends that recording problems with Gilbert's \\"highpitched, tense‚Äù voice and the star's rattled nerves in the presence of \\"the little talking device\\" as two reasons for the delayed release of Redemption. She asks, \\"Will it ever be released?\\" Reception In 1930, the film received widespread negative reviews from critics in major newspapers and in leading trade publications. Variety, the most popular entertainment paper at the time, found nothing good to say about Redemption, describing in its May 7 review as an inept production that was mind-numbing to watch despite its relatively brief running time of 65 minutes: For their participation in what Variety labels a cinematic \\"long yawn\\", the paper predicts, \\"Gilbert will be the chief sufferer and Fred Niblo will not go unharmed in reputation.\\" The Film Daily panned the film as well, calling it a \\"decidedly mediocre drama\\" that is \\"weak in nearly every department, including acting and direction\\". While it judged both Eleanor Boardman and Gilbert's performances as \\"unconvincing\\", the paper does credit Conrad Nagel with being \\"the only principal player who seems real.\\" Poor direction and \\"choppy\\" editing are The Film Daily's main complaints. \\"It is difficult\\", it states, \\"to associate this incompetent piece with [Niblo].\\" The New York Herald Tribune added to the chorus of negative reactions to the film in 1930. In its May 3 review, the Manhattan newspaper also makes a prediction: \\"We do not believe this film is going to be a great big hit.\\"M.T. (1930). \\"'Redemption'‚ÄîCapitol [Theatre]\\", New York Herald Tribune (New York City), May 3, 1930, p. 8. ProQuest Historical Newspapers. The Herald Tribune based that prediction chiefly on Gilbert's \\"uneven performance\\". Yet, with a degree of optimism, the newspaper expresses hope for the star's prospects in the new era of sound, \\"In time he may catch on to the demands of dialogue in films, but at the moment he remains...a far better pantomine artist than speaking actor.\\" \\"His voice\\", continues the Herald Tribune, \\"is all right, but his acting is so often self-conscious, wooden and even floundering.\\" The respected New York-based trade journal Harrison's Reports insisted that John Gilbert was not to blame for the film's lack of critical success and its disappointing draw at the box office. Promoting itself as \\"A Reviewing Service Free from the Influence of Film Advertising\\", the journal in its May 10, 1930 review assigns blame to the most fundamental aspect of any production: Outside the realms of trade journals and newspapers, even fan magazines in 1930 disliked the film. Screenland, for example, refers to Redemption in its July issue as \\"deep, dreary\\" and full of \\"Russian gloom\\", cautioning its readers, \\"you will probably writhe your way through this film.\\"\\"Critical Comment on Current Films: Redemption\\", Screenland (New York City), July 1930, p. 87.

He was influenced by the style of Gaetano Chierici, and by the Florentine Macchiaioli School. He worked mostly in the latter cities late in life.

Plans to close the school and merge students with South Fremantle Senior High School as a new school were announced in December 2014.

He led the Majeerteen Sultanate during the 19th century. Majeerteen Sultanate The Majeerteen Sultanate was established by Somalis from the Majeerteen Darod clan. Osman Mahamuud was the son of Mahmud V ibn Yusuf, who had ruled the Sultanate from 1644 to 1660. Mahmud fils thereafter assumed the throne, governing under the regal title of Boqor (King). The Majeerteen Sultanate rose to prominence that century under Boqor Osman's guidance.Helen Chapin Metz, Somalia: a country study, (The Division: 1993), p.10. Majeerteen-British agreement Due to consistent ship crashes along the northeastern Cape Guardafui headland, Boqor Osman's kingdom entered into an informal agreement with Britain, wherein the British agreed to pay the King annual subsidies to protect shipwrecked British crews and guard wrecks against plunder. The agreement, however, remained unratified, as the British feared that doing so would \\"give other powers a precedent for making agreements with the Somalis, who seemed ready to enter into relations with all comers.\\"David D. Laitin, Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience, (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.71 Majeerteen-Italian treaties In late 1889, Boqor Osman entered into a treaty with the Italians, making his realm an Italian protectorate. His rival Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid had signed a similar agreement vis-a-vis his own Sultanate the year before. Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist objectives, with Boqor Osman looking to use Italy's support in his ongoing power struggle with Kenadid over the Majeerteen Sultanate. In signing the agreements, the rulers also hoped to exploit the rival objectives of the European imperial powers so as to more effectively assure the continued independence of their territories. The terms of each treaty specified that Italy was to steer clear of any interference in the sultanates' respective administrations. In return for Italian arms and an annual subsidy, the Sultans conceded to a minimum of oversight and economic concessions. The Italians also agreed to dispatch a few ambassadors to promote both the sultanates' and their own interests.

At least two have flown. Design and development The AK3 is the third two- seat, single engine, low wing design from Andr√© Kieger. It is produced by Junkers Profly France and is alternatively known as the Junkers Profly Junka UL. The wing has a single spar with a plywood leading edge and a false spar for the mounting of ailerons and flaps. Production aircraft have small winglets. Each wing is fixed to the fuselage with a pair of sailplane style pins for rapid demounting. The fuselage is built around four longerons, giving it a square lower section; the upper fuselage is rounded and merges into the line of the large perspex canopy over the side-by-side seating. The tailplane is mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin is swept; both are plywood structures. There are horn balances on elevators and rudder. The AK3 is powered by a 58.8 kW (78.9 hp) Rotax 912 UL four cylinder horizontally opposed engine, housed in the nose under a carbon fibre cowling and driving a three blade propeller. It has a tricycle undercarriage, with glass/carcon fibre laminate cantilever spring main legs mounted onto the fuselage and a trailing link nose wheel on a forward angled cantilever leg. The mainwheels have hydraulic brakes and all wheels are faired. Operational history The AK3 had its first public showing at the Blois RSA meeting in August 2006. By then it had flown for more than 10 hours. At that time production by Junkers Profly was planned at three a month; one at least had been built by the end of 2007 but current rates are unclear.

This iteration of the club was formed with the merging in 1970 of the Latrobe Soccer Club and the Bardon Soccer Football Club, two of the oldest clubs in the Brisbane football competition (the two clubs had previously merged for the 1941 season, as 'Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club'). Although the local records are incomplete, the merged club, through its antecedent Latrobe Football Club (formed in 1916) appears to have had the longest continuous participation of any extant club in the Brisbane football competition. Whilst the Bardon Latrobe club's main focus since the merger has been predominantly on junior boys and girls' football, the club now has senior men's and women's teams playing in the Brisbane competition. The club, previously known as 'Bardon Latrobe Junior Soccer Club', was officially renamed 'Bardon Latrobe Football Club' in 2014. Club history =1970 merger= The contemporary club was originally formed as the 'Bardon Latrobe Soccer Football Club' for the 1970 season, with the merger of the Latrobe Soccer Club, then based at Gregory Park, Milton, and the Bardon Soccer Football Club, based at Bowman Park Bardon (see below). The merged club then played at Bowman Park, fielding both junior and senior teams, where it continues to play to this day. The reason for the merger is not recorded, but it is likely the two clubs did so to take advantage of their respective strengths in junior and senior football. During the 1960s, the Bardon club had a reasonably large junior section, but its senior side was struggling and was relegated to the Third Division in 1969. Conversely, the Latrobe club had abandoned junior football in the mid-1960s and, despite winning three senior men's First Division premierships during the same period, had been relegated to the Second Division competition for season 1969. However, Latrobe won that Second Division premiership, providing the newly-merged club with promotion to the First Division for the 1970 season. =Senior football= The newly merged club played its first season in the senior First Division (then the top tier in Brisbane football) in 1970, where it finished a creditable fourth out of ten teams. A highlight of the early 1970s was when first-team coach Jim Binnie arranged a friendly match against Rale Rasic's Socceroos as a warm-up before the 1974 World Cup. The game was played at Perry Park, with the Socceroos winning 7‚Äì0. The club continued playing in the First Division, but by 1976 was struggling financially as well as competitively. The decision was made to transfer the senior and reserve teams to the Mitchelton Football Club, where it would play the 1977 season as Bardon Latrobe, before being absorbed into the Mitchelton club. The club then decided to focus exclusively on junior football and was renamed the 'Bardon Latrobe Junior Soccer Club'. Despite this, a number of players subsequently elected to return to the Bardon Latrobe club and re-entered the Brisbane senior competition in the late 1970s as 'Bardon Latrobe Juniors', in a low division. The team won a number of premierships and regular promotion, culminating in promotion to Division 1 (the second tier of the newly re- structured Brisbane competition) in 1983, where they finished eighth out of twelve teams. There are few available records of the senior club after this time; however, the men's senior team played in the then Brisbane Division 2 from 1985 to 1988, reaching the finals in 1988 (coached by former NSL player Gary Bromfield). In 1989, the seniors merged with the Valley Soccer club to form the Latrobe Valley club, playing in Brisbane Division 2 in 1989 and then Division 3 from 1990 to 1994,Football Brisbane official website history page: QSF Divisional Points Tables 1992 , then reformed as Latrobe Athletic for the 1997 and 1998 seasons in 'Amateur' Division 1 of the Brisbane competition. After several seasons without a senior side, Bardon Latrobe re-entered the Brisbane senior competition in 2011, playing in the (amateur) Metropolitan League. With the restructuring of the Football Brisbane competitions for season 2013, the club entered first and reserve grade teams in the newly formed men's Capital League 4 division (the fifth tier of the Brisbane competition). The club won the premiership in this division in 2015, earning promotion to Capital League 3 for season 2016. The club also entered a third men's team in the 'City League 5 Blue' competition in 2015. Bardon Latrobe SC original badge (1970) =Junior football= Since 1971, the junior club has established a tradition of reciprocal tours with the Georges River Junior Soccer Club (Oyster Bay, New South Wales), where each year Under 12 and Under 13 teams from each club travel to compete socially against the other club. In 2011, the club earned the 'Junior Club of the Year Award', presented by Football Brisbane and based on a range of criteria, including the performance of the teams and quality of club management. =Club colours= As noted above, the club plays in a predominantly red strip, similar to the colour of the original Latrobe club's outfit. The reason this colour was selected by Latrobe is not recorded, but it may be a reference to the original name of their home ground, the 'Red Jacket Swamp' (see 'Gregory Park' below). Original Bardon Soccer Football Club =The club= The original Bardon club was formed in the late 1920s, fielding junior teams (at that time Under 21), with few senior teams until after World War II. The senior club played as an amateur club, and remained so during its separate existence, typically playing in the second and third tiers of the Brisbane competition. As well as this, the club continued to field junior boys‚Äô teams, but no junior girls or women's teams. =Beginnings= Bardon SFC badge (ca 1960s) The earliest known records of a football club at Bowman Park refer to the I.O.R. Bardon (Independent Order of Rechabites) team, which played fixtures in the Brisbane Third Grade in 1920 (the local I.O.R. 'tent' (branch) had been influential in the purchase by the government and dedication of Bowman Park as a public reserve in 1916). It is not known whether the I.O.R. team ultimately became the Bardon S.F.C., as there are few known records from that era. Anecdotal evidence has it that the Bardon S.F.C. was formed in 1926 (the year after the area was officially renamed 'Bardon' from Upper Paddington), and playing at Bowman Park. The Brisbane Courier reported in early 1926 that the \\"Soccer Football Association ... leased the grounds in Bowman Park\\".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 14 April 1926 The club was certainly in existence by 1928, as the Brisbane Courier reported in March that year that it had leased Bowman Park for winter sports for ¬£5 [five pounds ‚Äì approximately AUD350 in 2010RBA Inflation Calculator)].NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 22 March 1928 By the late 1920s, the club was well established, as evidenced by a newspaper report describing its end of season social at the Foresters' Hall, Paddington. The report listed the social committee as Mesdames Lansbury, Watson, Charrington, Thorpe, and Brewer and the secretary Mr M.Rowe.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 11 October 1929 Bardon S.F.C. may have been almost exclusively a junior club during those early years: it does not appear often in newspaper reports from the 1920s and 30s, and those few reports typically refer only to junior teams (at the time, 'junior' included players up to 21 years of age). The first known report of a senior team was in 1936 (see below). =1930s= By 1931, the club featured three junior teams: First Grade, Third Grade and Third Grade B Division. A newspaper report early that year noted that \\"Bardons [sic] have also been strengthened and should give a better account of themselves.\\" NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 8 April 1931 In 1937, the Rovers fielded a team in each of the 'Junior' Second and Third Grades. Despite not being in the top grade, one of the Bardon players, Wally Cansick, was selected for the Queensland Junior team to play New South Wales in that year. Cansick was to later play for Grange Thistle Soccer Club and for Queensland at senior level.Grange Thistle Soccer Club official website: History Another player, Alf Jones, played in the Brisbane side against Ipswich in the same year. One of the State selectors at that match, William Harper, was to influence the fortunes of the Latrobe club in the 1960s (see below).NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 27 August 1937 The earliest known report of a Bardon senior team was when Bardon Rovers nominated for the Third Grade in 1936 (whilst early reports referred to the club as 'Bardon', those in the mid-30s refer to the club as 'Bardon Rovers'). However, by season 1939, the club had reverted to fielding only junior teams.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 16 June 1939 Curiously, a newspaper report in 1939 refers to both 'Bardon' and 'Bardon Rovers' competing in the Stewart Shield (a junior competition) at the same time on the same dayNLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 31 May 1939 (it is possible the teams were the same club, but from different grades). As well as this, a newspaper report in 1941 refers to the club being founded in 1933 by Bill Trinder.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 24 April 1941 A newspaper advertisement in early 1939 also referred to the Bardon Rovers: \\"JUNIOR Soccer. Bardon Rovers require second grade players guernseys and socks free. Meetings Friday nights, Trinder's Boot Factory, Bardon. FO273. E. Jarvis, Secretary.\\"NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 5 May 1939 =Club colours= The club played in maroon and white colours (as noted in a newspaper report in 1929) and maintained those colours until the merger with Latrobe in 1970. Original Latrobe Football Club Latrobe SC badge (ca 1960s) =The club= The original Latrobe Football Club was one of the most successful and influential clubs in the Brisbane and Ipswich football competitions, winning nine first grade premierships between 1929 and 1967, behind only Lions FC (14 premierships between the mid-1950s and 2017) and Dinmore Bush Rats (10 premierships between the 1890s and the 1960s). Latrobe also won numerous cup and shield competitions (see the article History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland). The club is most likely named for nearby Latrobe Terrace, or the Paddington real estate subdivision the 'Latrobe Estate', carried out in the late 1870s.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier ‚Äì 11 April 1879 This subdivision occurred after the closure of the Paddington Cemetery (now the site of Suncorp Stadium) in 1875, and the creation of Given/Latrobe Terraces through that site. The street and the estate were, presumably, named for the former Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria Charles La Trobe, who died in 1875. =Beginnings= Again, there are few known existing records for the original Latrobe club, but anecdotal evidence has it that it was formed in 1916. This is supported by a newspaper report from 1933, which refers to the then Latrobe captain, Edgar Rigby, as having been \\"connected [with the club] since 1916\\".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 18 March 1933 However, the Latrobe club does not appear in newspaper reports until 1917,NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier ‚Äì 4 June 1917 playing in the Brisbane third grade competition with its home ground recorded as 'Milton' (the precise location of their field is not recorded, but was most likely at Gregory Park ‚Äì see below). This is likely because the local competition organisers, the Queensland British Football Association, decided early in 1916 \\"That no competition be held in the Senior, First or Second Grade competitions and that no player of military age be allowed to take part in a lower competition ... [but] clubs ... should be allowed to play friendly matches.\\" It has also been suggested that the club is descended from the 'Rag- Tag Football Club', which had also played at Gregory Park from the early 1900s. However, this is unlikely, as the latter club was still playing in the Brisbane competition as late as 1918. Given the number of clubs that were formed and disbanded during the early years of Brisbane football, it is possible that Latrobe may have been formed as a breakaway club from the 'Rag- Tag' club, or from the Milton Club (formed around 1903), but there is no known connection between the Latrobe club and either of these two clubs. Latrobe contested the third grade premiership in its inaugural season (1917), playing the final against 'Ellenas' (another Milton-based team) at Gregory Park, but losing 1‚Äì0. By 1919, the club remained in the Third Grade (but in its 'A Division') of the four-division competition.Brisbane Courier ‚Äì 6 October 1919 A newspaper report in 1941 asserts that Arthur Trinder was one of the club's \\"foundation members\\" (see 'Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club (1941)' below). =1920s= After several years in the lower divisions, the club was finally promoted to the first grade in 1924, where it finished fifth out of six teams. The club appeared to be well established by the mid-1920s, as it featured in the Brisbane Courier with a photograph entitled \\"Among the metropolitan football clubs\\". The team was listed as R. Patterson, T. Kitson, R. Wilson, H. Gilbert, R. Whitalan, J. Carton, J. Andersley, L. Rose, A. Chittern, H. Simpson, F. Hollywood (sec. and vice-capt.), F. Hayward (pres.), R. Patterson, D. Speechley, G. Findlay, D. Lord (capt.), J. Morrisey, H. Blackmore, J. Scriven. For season 1925, the club fared little better in the league but, despite this, acquired its first major silverware, winning the Tristram Shield (a 'knockout' competition), defeating the Thistle club 4‚Äì1 in the final. The club also won the Charity Cup, where they \\"outclassed\\" that season's Premiers, Pineapple Rovers, 5‚Äì2 in the semi-final, then defeated Dinmore Wanderers 3‚Äì1 in the final at the \\"Woolloongabba Cricket Ground\\" (now the Brisbane cricket ground), at that time the headquarters of soccer in Brisbane. The club lost in the final of the Tristram Shield the following year (to Blackstone Rovers), but then proceeded to win this shield a further six times between 1927 and 1934. In the ensuing years, the club climbed the ladder progressively, finishing second in 1928, then finished undefeated premiers in 1929, with a goal difference of 28 over fourteen matches. That season, the club won all of the available trophies, also including the Challenge Cup and the Tristram Shield. The 1929 squad comprised the following players: Nixon (goalkeeper); Len Viertel and Edgar Rigby (fullbacks); Bowen, Bert Murray and Zar Korotcoff (halfbacks); E. Alexander, Bell, Jim Carton, Eric ('Hec') Gorring and Taylor (forwards). The club clearly had a very strong squad, as its players comprised over half of that season's Brisbane representative squad: Rigby (vice- captain), Murray, Korotcoff, Alexander, Carton, Viertel, Gorring and H. Ross. =1930s= Soccer match at Lang Park Milton ca 1937 ‚Äì teams not known, but likely to be Latrobe in the dark jerseys Around 1930, the club became known as the Latrobe Soccer Club (rather than 'Football Club'), with the Brisbane Cricket Ground as its home ground. This proved to be the club's most successful period, when it won five premierships in a row (1929 to 1933) and a sixth in 1935. In 1935 the Queensland Soccer Council (QSC) took over the lease of Lang Park as its home ground (and thus leaving the Brisbane Cricket Ground)NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail ‚Äì 30 March 1935 and Latrobe became a sub-tenant, using the ground for its home games. However, by 1937, the QSC was considering sub-leasing Lang Park to \\"another code of football\\" as it \\"was not satisfied with the financial returns ... under the sub-lease to the Latrobe-Milton club\\". Latrobe in turn responded that \\"If no action is taken to introduce the Ipswich clubs into the Brisbane competition this season ... the Latrobe-Milton Club cannot accept an increase in rental for Lang Park. Give us competition play with Ipswich and my club will hold the ground as headquarters for the code.\\" The matter was resolved after much negotiation between the QSC and the tenant clubs, which could explain the QSC's decision to merge the Brisbane and Ipswich associations for the 1937 season, when the Ipswich and Brisbane teams resumed competition together for the first time since 1929. The Latrobe club returned to Gregory Park after World War II, where it remained until the merger with Bardon in 1970.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 23 August 1946 =1940s= 1940 saw the formation of the Queensland Soccer Football Association (QSFA) and problems for the game: the major Ipswich clubs initially decided not to affiliate with the QSFA, as they considered it was \\"unconstitutional\\". Those clubs, with the exception of St Helens, ultimately joined the Brisbane competition for that year, after some Ipswich players joined Brisbane clubs to continue their playing careers. Latrobe boasted \\"four international players\\", including two former Bundamba players, which suggests that Latrobe (if not other clubs as well) was operating on a semi-professional basis, in order to attract players from relatively distant locations (despite this being 'illegal' under the QSFA rules at that time). A newspaper article in 1940 appears to confirm this by reporting criticism of \\"certain first division clubs ... [which] continued to offer inducements to [younger] players to leave the club ...\\"NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail ‚Äì 26 March 1940 Notwithstanding Latrobe's strong squad, the Corinthians club won the Premiership that season. For the 1941 season, Latrobe merged with Bardon to form the Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club, but the merger lasted only one season (see Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club (1941) below). As noted, the Brisbane competition was suspended from 1942 to 1944 and Latrobe re-entered the Brisbane senior competition in 1946. The club subsequently finished last in season 1947 and was relegated to Division 2. =1950s= This decade was a lean period for the club, playing in Division 2 until winning the league in 1961, thus gaining promotion to the First Division for season 1962 (see also '1960s' below). =1960s= This decade saw a revival in the club's fortunes, with their return to the top grade in 1962. This was likely as a result of the efforts of William ('Pop') Harper, who had migrated to Australia from the United Kingdom in the early 1900s, and was involved with the game in Brisbane from at least the 1930s as a selector and referee (as noted above). Harper encouraged British and Irish migrants to come to the Latrobe club from the early 1960s with offers of jobs, accommodation and semi-professional football.Wikipedia article Aylesham (United Kingdom) As a result, the team predominantly comprised overseas players during this decade, and won three first grade premierships: 1964, 1966 and 1967 (the last as 'Latrobe-Wests Soccer Club'). Despite this success, the club finished last in 1968 and was relegated to the second grade for season 1969. Latrobe qualified for the Australia Cup five times in the 1960s with its best performance a quarter-final appearance. Former Socceroo Ray Richards played for Latrobe in the mid to late-1960s, and was a goalscorer in the club's 4‚Äì2 quarter-final loss to APIA Leichhardt in the 1964 Australia Cup. Latrobe- Bardon Soccer Club (1941) The Latrobe and Bardon clubs had previously merged for the 1941 season, as the 'Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club', playing senior matches at Gregory Park, Milton. Newspaper records from the time suggest that the clubs were exclusively 'senior' and 'junior' clubs respectively,NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier-Mail 4 April 1941 so this merger may have resulted from Bardon's strong performance in junior football (under 21) in 1940, where its first grade team won the premiership and included several Brisbane and Queensland representatives (including H. Jones [sic], F. Cansick and S. Cansick (Queensland) and D. Barry). A newspaper report in early 1941 noted \\"Latrobe Merge with Junior Premiers ... The amalgamation of Latrobe and Bardon, last year's first grade junior premiers, is the most important of many moves made by senior soccer clubs this season. The club will be known as Latrobe-Bardon, and four of the former Bardon players will play their first senior football against Booval at Booval to-morrow.\\"NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 4 April 1942 Another newspaper report that year said \\"TWENTY years ago Arthur Trinder was a foundation member of the Latrobe Club, which has been five times in succession soccer premiers. His brother, Bill, formed the Bardon Club in 1933, and its junior team was undefeated in fixtures last season. Now the Latrobe and Bardon Clubs have combined, and some of last year's Bardon juniors are getting their chance in A grade. They include Alf. Jones, E. Jarvis, F. and W. Cansick, and D. Barry [it is noteworthy that the dates in this report do not appear to be accurate when compared with other public records]. However, this merger did not survive the suspension of football fixtures from 1942 to 1944 (during the war years), as Latrobe re- appeared as a stand-alone club in the 1946 senior competition. Latrobe Ladies Football Club Latrobe Ladies FC 1921 The Latrobe club has the distinction of having formed one of the earliest known women's teams in Australian football history: the Latrobe Ladies‚Äô Football Club, in 1921 (see photograph at right). The club played 'friendly' matches in the newly formed Queensland Ladies Soccer Football Association, which included two other clubs, North Brisbane and South Brisbane. Remarkably, about 10,000 spectators attended at the Brisbane Cricket Ground in late 1921 to watch a ladies' match (between North Brisbane and South Brisbane). The annual meeting of the association in 1922 expressed the desire to commence regular fixtures during the forthcoming season with \\"about half a dozen teams\\".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier ‚Äì 25 February 1922 The new season commenced in June of that year with a match at Bowman Park (see below). However, there are no known records of the progress of this association after the 1922 season. The ladies' club patron, Mrs J.T. Gilday (pictured in the team portrait), was the wife of John Gilday Labor MLA for Ithaca, who had been active in procuring Bowman Park as a public reserve (see below). The Bardon Latrobe club has fielded junior girl's teams for many years, and in 2012 re-entered the Brisbane senior women's competition. Bowman Park David Bowman 1860‚Äì1916 Bowman Park, home of the Bardon Latrobe club since 1970, is located at the junction of Simpsons Road, David Avenue and Bowman Parade and bounded by Ithaca Creek, Bardon. The first land sales in this area, west of the locality then known as Upper Paddington, were held in 1862. Brisbane contractor Francis Lyon paid ¬£76 for 38 acres (just over 15 hectares) for the lot which included the area now forming Bowman Park (referred to as a \\"country lot\\", in the Parish of Enoggera). The park area was known at the time as the 'Cobbler's Flats', because of the \\"superabundance of pest weed called cobblers pegs\\"). Another purchaser was Joshua Jeays (Brisbane Municipal Council alderman, then mayor in 1864), who purchased 39 acres adjoining and to the east of Lyon's land, at a cost of ¬£78. Jeays built a house on his land in 1863 and named it 'Bardon', after Bardon Hill in his native Leicestershire, after which the suburb was officially named in 1925. The house still exists, and is now part of the nearby St Joseph's school campus. A letter to the editor of the Brisbane Courier in 1911, arguing against the conversion of the Paddington Cemetery (now the site of Lang Park) to a sports ground, suggested that: :As it fortunately happens a really good opportunity now occurs to secure a splendid sports ground within a few minutes' walk of the Paddington tram terminus, and directly in the line which any future extension must take. The Bardon Estate is shortly to be cut up and sold, and the lower part of the Estate known as Cobblers' Flat can surely be secured for a reserve. A more suitable piece of land could, I think hardly be found. Of fair extent, level, and well watered. Ithaca Creek runs round it and it is already well supplied with shade trees and would require very little more than fencing to make a splendid park. It is already and has been for years a favourite location for school treats, picnics and the like There is ample space for cricket, football lacrosse, and all other healthy sports ... I therefore hope that steps will be taken to secure this land for the people before it is too late. Another writer in the same year added \\"I am given to understand that the whole of this beautiful spot can be purchased for ¬£2000 [approximately AUD140,000 in 2010]. This is an opportunity that ought not to be neglected ... Already hundreds of persons from Brisbane visit Bardon flat on holidays and Sundays.\\"NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 7 September 1911 The land was subsequently subdivided for residential development in 1915 and an area of 18 acres (approximately 7 hectares) was reserved then named 'Bowman Park' in 1916 (after David Bowman (1860‚Äì1916), former MLA for Warrego and Fortitude Valley, leader of Queensland Labor Party from 1907 to 1912, and Home Secretary in the first majority Labor Government in Queensland's history). Early transport to Upper Paddington was by horse omnibus, then electric trams that reached Macgregor Terrace in 1909. The tram service was not extended to Bowman Park until 1937, eleven years after the establishment of the original Bardon soccer club. Bowman Park was officially opened on Saturday 23 September 1916. The Brisbane Telegraph subsequently reported: :In the presence of a gathering of about 1,000 persons the Lieutenant-Governor (Sir Arthur Morgan) as deputy for the Governor, officially opened Bowman Park, on Saturday afternoon. The park which consists of 17 1/2 acres of land, formerly known as Cobbler's Flat, Upper Paddington, for many years has been a favourite picnic ground. The Mayor [Alderman Lugg] ... stated that the park was the outcome of the activity of Upper Paddington Progress Association, in the face of some opposition. The park cost ¬£789 15s, and the balance of the ¬£1,000 voted for park purposes would be spent on improvements. :Sir Arthur Morgan ... heartily congratulated the people of that ward upon the success of their park movement ... The land upon which they were assembled that day was most suitable for park purposes, and especially for the holding of sports ... No doubt the greatest credit for the establishment of that park was due to the late Mr. [David] Bowman, with whom he had had the honour of being closely associated in public life, and for whose memory he had the profoundest respect, because of the late Mr. Bowman's outstanding sincerity, and his deep 'concern for the welfare of the people ... It afforded great pleasure to him to declare the park open. (Loud applause.)NLA Trove website: Telegraph 25 September 1916 Contemporaneous newspaper reports show that several soccer football clubs played at Bowman Park after this time, including Glenallen, IOR Bardon, Latrobe, Ovals, Paddington and St Barnabas. The park was also leased by the Brisbane Junior Football Association around 1920, and junior games were played there from that time. The Telegraph newspaper of 13 May 1920 reported 'Third Grade Junior' matches there, including Latrobe vs Annerley.NLA Trove website: Telegraph 13 May 1920 In 1922, the opening match of the Queensland Ladies' Football Association season was played at Bowman Park. The Brisbane Telegraph reported: :FEMININE FOOTBALLERS Femininity and football still may, be said to be only in the preliminary stages in Brisbane. There are many ‚Äì if not a decided majority ‚Äì who still hold up deprecatory hands. Nevertheless the first season was, last year, successfully passed through, and the second stage of the experience was entered upon last Saturday ... the first serious game of the season took place at Bowman Park, Bardon. The opposing teams were the Brisbane City Ladies and the Brisbane Ladies' Soccer Football Clubs respectively. [...] The corner of the park in which the match took place was not exactly a bowling green, and more than once a good straight kick was frustrated by a slump, But there were no accidents, and the players treated those untoward deflection's in quite a sportsmanlike way. The City team won 12‚Äì0, with seven goals scored by their centre-forward Miss V. Molloy.NLA Trove website\\": Telegraph 19 June 1922 Bowman Park is also home to the West Brisbane Cricket Club, which has played there since that club's formation in 1921. Gregory Park Sir Augustus Gregory Gregory Park, former home of the original Latrobe club, is located at the intersection of Baroona and Haig Roads, Milton, adjoining the present Milton State School (itself established on the site in 1889). The park is located on what was originally known as the 'Red Jacket Swamp', part of a string of lagoons which stretched from the then suburb of Rosalie (now part of Paddington), through the former Milton Tennis Centre to the Brisbane River. The origin of the name 'Red Jacket Swamp' is not certain ‚Äì various legends had that it was named for a soldier's lost jacket, a resident bird species, or for the iron salts in the water that stained local boys' clothing a dull red colour. Another report in a 1931 newspaper noted that \\"[A]ccording to old residents ... the swamp received its name from a small flower-like weed that flourished in its muddy waters, during certain months of the year the leaves- no larger than a threepenny piece-would change in hue to brick red.\\"NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 30 May 1931 In 1898, the Milton school headmaster, Mr Alfred Wall, advised the local M.L.A. Mr Thomas Finney regarding the swamp that \\"If it was raised 2ft. 6in. or 3ft. [750‚Äì900 mm], it could be converted into a healthy place, and might be grassed over and planted with shade trees. The area would make a very pleasant park and sports ground ...\\".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 12 November 1898 The swamp was finally drained and filled in the early 1900s, reserved as public space and named the Rosalie Recreation Reserve. The reserve became the home of the Milton Rangers Football Club around 1903 (as noted above) and the Milton Cricket Club, which celebrated the opening of its new concrete wicket in November 1906. The reserve was subsequently renamed 'Gregory Park' in late 1905, to honour Sir Augustus Gregory, Queensland's Surveyor-General from 1859 to 1879, who had died in June 1905. Gregory had been a nearby resident and had agitated for the reclamation works at the Red Jacket Swamp. The earliest known record of the use of goal nets in Brisbane was at Gregory Park, for the opening game of the 1907 season between the Milton Football Club and Ipswich club Dinmore Bush Rats (which Dinmore won 4‚Äì1). Other soccer clubs, including 'St Ellena's', 'Mallina', 'Rag-Tag' and 'Gregory Rovers' (and possibly 'Fernberg'), were also reported as playing at Milton in the early 1900s. Most of these clubs do not appear in the public records after World War I.

Biography Mapes was born in New York on May 29, 1806. His father, Jonas Mapes, was a major-general in command of the New York state forces in and around New York in the year 1812. Nearly all his ancestors on the father's side were farmers on Long Island, back to 1640, when Thomas Mapes came from England and settled there. In his early years, James showed passion for chemistry, invention and military matters. From the age of 11, for a few years, he studied at the classical school of Timothy Clowes at Hempstead, Long Island, while living with renowned English reformer William Cobbett. When only seventeen years of age he delivered a full course of lectures in New York on \\"Military Tactics\\". Later Mapes became known as an analytical chemist, and his analyses of beer and wines, made at requests of the senate of New York and the temperance societies, were regarded as standard experiments. He was one of the first manufacturer of magnesium sulfate from magnesium hydrobisilicate and the author of many improvements in tempering steel, distilling, dyeing, and other areas. In 1832 he invented a new system of sugar refining and later an apparatus for manufacturing sugar from the cane. He was the inventor of processes for tanning leather and the manufacture of sugar from West India molasses. He also designed a centrifugal machine for separating molasses from sugar. Soon after the organization of the National Academy of Design in New York he was appointed professor of chemistry and natural philosophy to that institution. Subsequently, he was appointed professor of chemistry and natural philosophy to the American Institute. In 1844 he was elected president of the Mechanics' Institute of New York. He was one of the founders of the National Agricultural Society, and held the position of vice-president of the American Institute, with which he had been actively connected for at least 25 years. He was made a permanent member of the New York Lyceum of Natural History, and of the National Institute at Washington, and an honorary member of the Scientific Institute of Brussels, Royal Society of Saint Petersburg, Geographical Society of Paris, Artists' Fund Society of Philadelphia, and several horticultural and agricultural societies of Europe and America. In 1847, Mapes moved to New Jersey, bought a farm there, near Irvington, and devoted himself to scientific agriculture, particularly fertilizers (the \\"Mapes Fertilizer\\" patented in 1859J. J. Mapes \\"Improvement in fertilizers\\" issued December 20, 1859), drainage, crop rotation and seeding. He was actively popularizing his agricultural methods, via public exhibitions at his farm. In Newark, New Jersey, Mapes organized the Franklin Institute and was its first lecturer. In July 1851, he became associate editor of the Journal of Agriculture, a semimonthly edition started in Boston. As a writer he was distinguished for terseness and simplicity of style. Family Young James Mapes At the age of twenty-one Mapes married a Long Island lady, Sophia Furman, two years his junior, daughter of the Judge Garret Furman, of Maspeth, Long Island.

Turkish battle scene, XVIII century Biography Born in Parma, Simonini was trained at the school of Francesco Monti (known as Brescianino delle Battaglie for his battle scenes) under the guidance of his fellow pupil Ilario Spolverini. Crucial importance attaches in this connection to a trip to Florence, where he studied the works of Jacques Courtois, known as Borgognone, in great depth and made some copies of them. He also visited Rome and Bologna but found success in Venice, where he worked for Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, mercenary commander of the Venetian forces in the struggle against the Turks, from 1733 to 1745 and painted a great number of battle scenes involving cavalry. His peculiar style, characterised by quick brushstrokes and the use of bright colours, was developed under the influence of the contemporary Venetian school with particular reference to view painters such as Marco Ricci and Francesco Guardi.

It had a more powerful engine Walter Mikron II 44 kW (60 hp). An increase in engine power required strengthening of the basic structure which Milutinovic used to make general improvements to the aircraft. Wing relative thickness was increased from 6% to 15% which strengthened the wings, and resulting in the removal of wire ties. Now the wings were covered with cardboard to the half swing instead of cloth which resulted in an improved overall stiffness of the aircraft. This also enabled the landing gear and aerodynamic characteristics of new aircraft to be upgraded, while the weight was only slightly increased. Operational history After successful testing and registration (YU-PDX) the SIM-VI was bought by the Central Administration of the Aero Club, which used the it at airshows and for the training of sport pilots. The aircraft did not enter serial production because it could not be used at smaller and under-equipped airports that existed in central Serbia. Flight tests that were carried out at the Zemun airfield proved that the SIM-VI-a had slightly better performance than its predecessor, and was able to perform basic stunts. After being granted a navigation license the plane was registered under civil designation YU-PEZ and it was bought by Aero Club's Central Administration. The plane was used until the beginning of the war in 1941 at air shows, sports competitions and for pilot training. Pilot and engineer Arsenijevic, piloted this plane at the competition Little Entente states in 1938. during the competition the plane flew some 3,274 km (2,034.37 miles) achieving an average speed of . Pilots who flew the plane felt that the plane was agile and easy to operate and fly, but despite good features and relatively low cost, SIM-VI did not go into serial production it could not win over the traditional empirical approach (a robust and powerful aircraft is a good aircraft). Right before the outbreak of war, the aircraft was included into the Yugoslav Royal Air Force, deployed as a signalling plane but was destroyed during the bombing of Lazarevac airfield on 7 April 1941.

It was originally described as a subspecies of Rana grisea (now Papurana grisea), but raised to full- species status in 2007. Description Adult males grow to and adult females to in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is acutely pointed. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are webbed to the base of toe discs. The hind limbs are relatively long. Dorsal and lateral surfaces are mostly smooth. Females are dorsally russet or orange brown. There is almost always a clear yellow stripe on the rear of the thigh, contrasting with the chocolate brown ground color. Males are typically dirty brown or tan. The yellow line on the thighs is often short or broken. The male advertisement call is rather complex and variable. The first part is a series weak clucking sounds, followed by a loud, guttural croaking note. Habitat and conservation Papurana milneana occurs in low-elevation and mid-elevation forest streams at elevations up to above sea level. It is nocturnal and most commonly found along the banks and in the stream beds of streams consisting of hard substrates (cobbles, rocks, or boulders), but can occasionally traversing the forest at night, well away from water.

Life and career Arpa was born in Carmona, Spain on 19 February 1858, into a very modest family. His father was a cobbler. He displayed a talent for drawing at a young age and was apprenticed to a local painter and decorater. In 1868, he was sent to Seville to study at the Academia Real des Bellas Artes (The Royal Academy of Fine Arts). There, he worked as a house painter during the day, and attended art classes in the evenings. Later, he studied under Eduardo Cano de la Pe√±a at the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville, where he won the Rome Prize three times, allowing him to study at the Academia des Bellas Artes in Rome.Remy, 2011. On his return to Seville, he found that the internationally renowned Spanish painter, Mari√† Fortuny was also working in Seville at the same time. Although the pair probably never met, Fortuny became a major influence on Arpa's work. On account of that influence, he developed a preference for 'plein air' paintings of typical Spanish subjects, which at the time was known in Spain as 'costumbrismo'. He remained in Seville for nine years, where he made many paintings, sketches and also completed a series of ceiling decorations in the Circulo Mercantil Sevilla (Seville Mercantile Building).Caso, E. D., Les Orientalistes de l'Ecole Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, p. 272 In late 1895 or early 1896, by which time he had become an established artist, Arpa sailed from Spain to Vera Cruz, Mexico and from there travelled to Texas. During his years in San Antonio, Texas he influenced many painters, most notably Xavier Gonzalez, Octavio Medell√≠n, and Porfirio Salinas.Ruth Goddard. 1975. Porfirio Salinas. Austin: Rock House Press. He exhibited and sold paintings in each of the places where he lived.  Work He painted in a realistic style, and was especially noted for his use of brilliant colors and his expertise in capturing the visual effects of sunlight. His work has been widely exhibited;Frances Battaile Fisk. 1928. A History of Texas Artists and Sculptors. Abilene, Tex.: privately printed; reprinted by Morrison Books, Austin, Tex., 1986. ten of his paintings are in the collection of the San Antonio Museum of Art.

He is regarded as one of the last painters in the tradition of the Flemish Baroque and the last follower of Peter Paul Rubens. Life Herreyns was a scion of a family of artists. Hi great-grandfather was the painter and printmaker Jacob Herreyns the Elder. His grandfather Jacob Herreyns the younger was also a painter. His father Jacob III Herreyns was a painter and decorator. His uncle Daniel Herreyns the younger was a sculptor.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1243-1262 He got his initial training from these relatives. Subsequently he studied at the Academy of Antwerp where the prominent history and portrait painter Balthasar Beschey was one of his teachers. The young painter won in 1764 the first prize for painting from life at the Academy. He completed his studies in the same year. A year later he became one of the six director-teachers of the Academy as the replacement of Andries Cornelis Lens who had also been a pupil of Balthasar Beschey. In 1767 Herreyns left the Academy and travelled.Twee altaarschilderijen van de kerk van Gijzegem Portrait of the painter Andries Cornelis Lens Upon his return to Belgium in 1771 he went to live in Mechelen where he got married. He was appointed as a director of the local drawing school. This school was renamed 'Academie van beeldende kunsten' (Academy of Visual Arts) in 1772 and was placed under the protection of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, the then governor and de facto sovereign of the Austrian Netherlands. He taught a few arts subjects in Mechelen and worked on many commissions. He was offered a position by the Academy of Brussels but despite the attractive salary offered he decided to remain in Mechelen. After invading the Austrian Netherlands in 1792, the French abolished the existing school system and as a result, Herreyns lost his academic position. Following the creation of central schools by the French, Herreyns returned to Antwerp in 1795 to become a teacher of drawing at the central school of the department of Deux-N√®thes.Guillaume Jacques Herreijns in Biographie Nationale, Volume 9, p. 288-291 In 1797 he saved 328 paintings from the churches and monasteries that had been ordered closed by the French occupiers. Many of these paintings had in fact been stolen. He worked on the return of Rubens' paintings Our Lady with the parrot and The Madonna surrounded by Saints. Abraham visited by the three Angels In 1800 he was invited to become together with Balthasar Paul Ommeganck a teacher of the members of the newly established Genootschap der Kunsten (\\"'Society for the arts'). This was an organisation set up at the initiative of Mattheus Ignatius van Bree and included initially Jan van Bree, Jean-Baptiste Berr√©. Lambrecht Dentijn, Jan Carpentero, Ferdinand Verhoeven, Peter Iven, Michiel Dierickxen, Jan Peeters and others. The members undertook to meet monthly to show and discuss their works and enjoy the tuition of the older generation of painters such as Herreyns. At the end of 1800 the pre- existing artist organisation Konstmaatschappij, which had been established in 1788, was merged with the Genootschap der Kunsten. The merged organisation would organise an annual exhibition of its members' works. Herreyns served as the chairman of the merged entity. In 1800 Herreyns was appointed a teacher- director of the former Antwerp Academy, which had been renamed l'√âcole sp√©ciale de peinture, sculpture et architecture d'Anvers (Special school of painting, sculpture and architecture of Antwerp). When the school was renamed an academy in 1804, Herreyns could maintain his position which he would hold until his death.Willem Jacob Herreyns at Mechelen mapt In 1810 he got permission from Napoleon to set up a museum in the former Franciscan monastery in Antwerp. In 1815, 38 of the 63 pictures removed by the French were added to its collection. His pupils included Jacobus Everhardus Josephus van den Berg, Ludwig Br√ºls, Hendrik de Cort, Guillaume Henri Franquinet, Jean Baptiste Berr√©, Jan Frans van Geel, Jozef Geirnaert, Pieter van Huffel, Joseph Jacops, Pierre Kremer, Peter Paul Joseph No√´l, Cornelis & Gerard van Spaendonck, Jan Baptist & Martinus Gerardus Tetar van Elven, Henri Van der Poorten, Gustave Wappers, and Willem van der Worp.Willem Jacob Herreyns at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He also taught the young Antoine-Joseph Wiertz. Work Herreyns‚Äô work was very highly regarded in his time. During a visit to Antwerp in 1780, the Swedish king Gustav III admired one of Herreyn's works called The Purification of the Virgin, then in the Saint-Michael's Abbey. The king immediately decided to appoint Herreyns as his court painter, although in reality Herreyns never went to Sweden. The Austrian Emperor Joseph II also praised his work during his visit to Mechelen and Herreyns painted two portraits of the emperor. The Last Supper His religious compositions stand in the Rubens tradition, which he had studied initially under his master Balthasar Beschey, who painted in the 17th century Flemish Baroque style. Herreyns received many commissions from religious institutions in the province of Antwerp for which he painted large religious paintings. In 1775 he was commissioned by the Jezuits in Mechelen to design a series of floats on the occasion of the celebrations for the thousandth anniversary of the city's patron saint Rumbold of Mechelen. He designed the floats together with local sculptor Pieter Valckx and also designed the triumphal arches. The designs were inspired by the designs of Rubens for the 1635 Joyous Entry by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand into Antwerp. He painted a cavalry for Benedict Neefs in Hemiskem, now in the Royal Museum of Antwerp. After his return to Antwerp in 1797 Herreyns mainly painted portraits for which he was highly esteemed. His educational influence now eclipses his reputation as a painter. Herreyns is considered the last follower of the Flemish baroque tradition founded by Peter Paul Rubens. He was a good colorist (tending towards the dark and red) and a draughtsman with a precise line, but his work shows a certain coldness and lacks originality. Herreyns' notable works include a Portrait of the painter Andries Cornelis Lens (after 1770), Godfrey, abbot of Tongerlo (1793) and John the Baptist in the Desert (1813). His work can be found in the Sint-Jan Baptist en Evangelist in Mechelen and the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp.

Shortly after Alexander's death in Babylon, the possession of his body became a subject of negotiations between Perdiccas, Ptolemy I Soter, and Seleucus I Nicator. According to Nicholas J. Saunders, while Babylon was the \\"obvious site\\" for Alexander's resting place, some favored interring the ruler in the Argead burial at Aegae, modern Vergina. Aegae was one of the two originally proposed resting places, according to Saunders, the other being Siwa Oasis and in 321 BC Perdiccas presumably chose Aegae. The body, however, was hijacked en route by Ptolemy I Soter. According to Pausanias and the contemporary Parian Chronicle records for the years 321‚Äì320 BC, Ptolemy initially buried Alexander in Memphis. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, during the early Ptolemaic dynasty, Alexander's body was transferred from Memphis to Alexandria, where it was reburied. The so-called Alexander Sarcophagus, unrelated to Alexander's body and once thought to be the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus, is now believed to be that of Mazaeus, a Persian governor of Babylon. Background According to Quintus Curtius Rufus and Justin, Alexander asked shortly before his death to be interred in the temple of Zeus Ammon at Siwah Oasis. Alexander, who requested to be referred to and perceived as the son of Zeus Ammon, did not wish to be buried alongside his actual father at Aegae. Alexander's body was placed in a coffin of \\"hammered gold\\", according to Diodorus, which was \\"fitted to the body\\". The coffin is also mentioned by Strabo and Curtius Rufus (subsequently, in 89‚Äì90 BC the golden coffin was melted down and replaced with that of glass or crystal). Alexander's wish to be interred in Siwa was not honored. In 321 BC, on its way back to Macedonia, the funerary cart with Alexander's body was hijacked in Syria by one of Alexander's generals, Ptolemy I Soter. In late 322 or early 321 BC Ptolemy diverted the body to Egypt where it was interred in Memphis, the center of Alexander's government in Egypt. While Ptolemy was in possession of Alexander's body, Perdiccas and Eumenes had Alexander's armor, diadem and royal scepter. According to Plutarch, who visited Alexandria, Python of Catana and Seleucus were sent to a serapeum to ask the oracle whether Alexander's body should be sent to Alexandria and the oracle answered positively. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC Alexander's body was transferred from the Memphis tomb to Alexandria for reburial (by Ptolemy Philadelphus in , according to Pausanias). Later Ptolemy Philopator placed Alexander's body in Alexandria's communal mausoleum. The mausoleum was called the Soma or Sema, which means \\"body\\" in Greek. By 274 BC Alexander was already entombed in Alexandria. The Tomb of Alexander became the focal point for the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great. Historical attestations Augustus during his visit to Alexander's tomb, painted by S√©bastien Bourdon in 1643 In 48 BC Alexander's tomb was visited by Caesar. To finance her war against Octavian, Cleopatra took gold from the tomb. Shortly after the death of Cleopatra, Alexander's resting place was visited by Octavian, who is said to have placed flowers on the tomb and a golden diadem upon Alexander's head. According to Suetonius, Alexander's tomb was then partially looted by Caligula, who reportedly removed his breastplate. In AD 199 Alexander's tomb was sealed up by Septimius Severus during his visit to Alexandria. Later, in 215 some items from Alexander's tomb were relocated by Caracalla. According to chronicler John of Antioch, Caracalla removed Alexander's tunic, his ring, his belt with some other precious items and deposited them on the coffin. When John Chrysostom visited Alexandria in AD 400, he asked to see Alexander's tomb and remarked, \\"his tomb even his own people know not\\". Later authors, such as Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam (b. AD 803), Al-Masudi (b. AD 896) and Leo the African (b. 1494), report having seen Alexander's tomb. Leo the African, who visited Alexandria as a young man, wrote: \\"In the midst of the ruins of Alexandria, there still remains a small edifice, built like a chapel, worthy of notice on account of a remarkable tomb held in high honor by the Mahometans; in which sepulchre, they assert, is preserved the body of Alexander the Great... An immense crowd of strangers come thither, even from distant countries, for the sake of worshipping and doing homage to the tomb, on which they likewise frequently bestow considerable donations\\". George Sandys, who visited Alexandria in 1611, was reportedly shown a sepulchre there, venerated as the resting place of Alexander. Present location 1893 map of Alexandria 2015 map of Alexandria. Possible site of Alexander the Great tomb is # 7 Mosque of the Nabi Daniel in Alexandria, painted in 1918 The Egyptian Supreme Council for Antiquities has officially recognized over 140 search attempts for Alexander's tomb. Mahmoud el-Falaki (1815‚Äì1885), who compiled the map of ancient Alexandria, believed Alexander's tomb is in the center of Alexandria, at the intersection of the Via Canopica (modern Horreya Avenue) and the ancient street labeled R5. Since then several other scholars such as Tasos Neroutsos, Heinrich Kiepert and Ernst von Sieglin placed the tomb in the same area. In 1850 Ambroise Schilizzi announced the discovery of alleged Alexander's mummy and tomb inside the Nabi Daniel Mosque in Alexandria. Later, in 1879 a stone worker accidentally broke through the vaulted chamber inside the basement of that mosque. Some granite monuments with an angular summit were discerned there, but the entrance was then walled up and the stone worker was asked not to disclose the incident. (The image on a Roman lamp in the National Museum of Pozna≈Ñ and others at the British Museum and the Hermitage Museum are interpreted by some scholars as showing Alexandria with the Soma Mausoleum pictured as a building with a pyramidal roof.) In 1888 Heinrich Schliemann attempted to locate Alexander's tomb within the Nabi Daniel Mosque, but he was denied permission to excavate. In 1993, Triantafyllos Papazois developed the theory that it is not Philip II of Macedon who is buried in the royal tomb II at Vergina, Greece, but it is Alexander the Great together with his wife Roxanne, while his son Alexander IV is buried in tomb III.Saunders, Alexander's tomb, p.187 Also based on the ancient historical sources he came to the conclusion that the breastplate, the shield, the helmet and the sword found in tomb II, belong to the armor of Alexander the Great.Œ§.Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ∂œéŒ∑œÇ, Œü ŒúŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÇ ŒëŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ ŒºŒµ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµŒπŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∏Œ±ŒºŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ œÉœÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÇ œÑŒ¨œÜŒøœÖœÇ ŒôŒô Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒôŒôŒô œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒíŒµœÅŒ≥ŒØŒΩŒ±œÇ, 2017 In 1995, Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi announced that she identified one alleged tomb in Siwah with that of Alexander. The claim was put in doubt by the then general secretary of the Greek Ministry of Culture, George Thomas, who said that it was unclear whether or not the excavated structure is even a tomb. Thomas and members of his team said that the style of the excavated object was not, as Souvaltzi contended, Macedonian, and that the fragments of tablets they were shown did not support any of the translations provided by Souvaltzi as proof of her finding. According to one legend, the body lies in a crypt beneath an early Christian church. In a 2011 episode of the National Geographic Channel television series Mystery Files, Andrew Chugg claimed that Alexander the Great's body was stolen from Alexandria, Egypt, by Venetian merchants who believed it to be that of Saint Mark the Evangelist. They smuggled the remains to Venice, where they were then venerated as Saint Mark the Evangelist in the Basilica Cattedrale Patriarcale di San Marco. The 2014 discovery of a large Alexander-era tomb at Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis in the region of Macedonia, Greece, has once again led to speculation about Alexander's final resting place. Some have speculated that it was built for Alexander but never used due to Ptolemy I Soter having seized the funeral cortege. They suggest that the Roman Emperor Caracalla, a great admirer of Alexander, may have had him re-interred in Amphipolis in the late second century AD. However, only future excavation at Amphipolis will reveal if there is any truth in the suggestion. In November 2014, a skeleton was discovered within the tomb,Greek Government - Ministry of Culture and Sports - 12th November 2014 Press Release (in Greek) and its full examination is expected to last a few months in order to determine the characteristics of the deceased person in the effort to identify it. However, the excavation team, based on findings unearthed at the site, argued that the tomb was a memorial dedicated to the close friend of Alexander the Great, Hephaestion. In 2019, a marble statue of Alexander was found by a Greek archaeologist, Calliope Limneos-Papakosta, who has been excavating for 14 years in the Shallalat Gardens, which occupies the ancient royal quarter in Alexandria.

The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party gained overall control of the council from the Labour party. Background Before the election Labour had run the council since 1995 and since the 2003 election had 23 seats, compared to 21 for the Conservatives. The Conservatives had therefore needed to gain 2 seats to take control from Labour. Election result The results saw the Conservatives gain control of the council from Labour, the first time the Conservatives had control of the council in 20 years. The Conservatives moved to 26 seats after winning 54% of the vote, while Labour dropped to 16 seats on a 40% vote share. Overall turnout at the election was 36.4%, up from 31% at the 2003 election. The Conservative gains included taking all 3 seats in the wards of Painters Ash and Singlewell from Labour. The Conservatives also held the seats in Whitehill where the two sitting councillors, George Lambton and Derek Robinson, had stood as independents after being deselected by the Conservatives before the election. The leader of the Conservatives on the council, Michael Snelling, said \\"I am over the moon. I think we have exceeded our expectations.\\", while the Labour council leader, John Burden said he planned \\"to come back in four years' time\\". The election in Meopham North was postponed after the death of one of the Conservative councillors Malcolm Burgoyne on 25 April. The delayed election in Meopham North was held on 21 June and saw the Conservatives hold both seats in the ward.

Palazzo dello Strozzino is a Renaissance palace in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. The stone Renaissance facade is located on Piazza degli Strozzi, diagonal to the Southeast corner of the imposing Palazzo Strozzi. The Northern fa√ßade on Via dei Anselmi houses the entrance to the Cinema Odeon. History The palace, once known as the Palazzo delle Tre Porte for its three ground doorways, was a residence of the cadet branch of the Strozzi family; it was older and smaller than the grandiose Palazzo Strozzi. The palace houses the Cinema Odeon, designed (1920) by Marcello Piacentini, as well as the language school of the British Institute of Florence. Built on land owned by Palla Strozzi, it passed to his cousins Agnolo and Palla di Novello after his exile in 1434. They ordered a renovation around 1457, with the design attributed to Filippo Brunelleschi, although other architects participated in the construction, including Michelozzo, to whom the lower fa√ßade, featuring an irregular rustication, is attributed. The first floor, which has double mullioned windows and a gentler rustication, is attributed to Giuliano da Maiano (c. 1456). The third floor, with more polished stone, was not added until the 19th century, in a style paralleling similar Renaissance palaces.I palazzo; Arte e Storia degli edifici Civile di Firenze Volume 2, by Sandra Carlini, Lara Mercanti, Giovanni Straffi, (2004), Florence, page 107. Michelozzo also designed the internal courtyard (c. 1460), which had a portico with columns. The courtyard was destroyed to accommodate the cinema. The palazzo was partially demolished in the period when Florence was the capital of Italy (1865). Earlier in the 19th century, as part of the Risanamiento the whole neighborhood was altered. The land in front of the Palazzo Strozzi now occupied by the Palazzo Mattei was once the site of the Piazza delle Cipolle and the church of Santa Maria degli Ughi.I Palazzi, page 107.

The president of the university is Sayyid Abulhasan Navab, one of its founding members. The university has four vice presidents: Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Research, Vice President for Cultural & Student Affairs and Vice President for Administrative & Financial Affairs. History In 1995 a group of scholars from Hawza of Qom interested in and concerned with religious and cultural matters, decided to pioneer a movement towards the study of various religions and other Islamic sects and denominations. This resulted in the establishment of a research institute which eventually became the University of Religions and Denominations. The institute began its activities with a group of students from Qom Seminary in a small building, with meager resources and facilities. At first, there was a special four-year academic course in three fields: Abrahamic Religions, Non- Abrahamic Religions and Islamic Sects. During their studies, the students also learned English, Sanskrit and Hebrew languages. After about ten years of hard work and endeavor, training of elite students, and meeting the legal requirements governing the universities, this institute became legally a university.

Playing career Ed Redys was born June 23, 1921 in Detroit, Michigan. His professional baseball career started as a pitcher in the St. Louis Browns organization. In 1942, while assigned to the San Antonio Missions minor league team, Redys suffered an ankle injury and did not pitch the rest of the season. Before he could return from injury, he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army. After not playing baseball for the remainder of the war, he returned in 1946 and injured his elbow. Although he played a few more years of minor league baseball, he was never promoted to the major league club. Between stints in 1940‚Äì1941 and 1946‚Äì1947, he finished with a 28-26 minor league win-loss record and a 3.29 earned run average Coaching career In 1950, after two years as the batting practice pitcher for the St. Louis Browns, he was named a coach by Bill DeWitt, the owner of the Browns. In 1950, the Browns went 58-96 and were second to last in the league standings. In 1951, Bill Veeck became the owner of the team and signed Satchel Paige to the team.

Youngman makes addresses to the Internet at large in online episodes of a series titled \\"Art Thoughtz.\\" Most often, Youngman takes on the role of art critic or cultural critic while speaking to topics concerning art, race, gender, and popular culture. In addition, Youngman makes DJ mixtapes called \\"CVS Bangers\\" with songs interspersed with seemingly random statements and air horn blasts.\\"CVS Bangers 3 will make you ask 'damn son, where'd you find this?'\\", Village Voice. In his video monologues, Youngman becomes a tutor to an audience of hopeful artists in search of success. By explaining traditional art concepts and relating them to pop culture and real-world examples, he is able to expose issues and conflicts within contemporary art society. A scheme is perpetuated, through Youngman and the \\"Art Thoughtz\\" videos, of following an often sympathetic character, one who is apparently outside the art world, attempting to understand and permeate a seemingly exclusive cultural society. This sort of 'underdog in the art world' characterization can be seen in the work of video artist of Alex Bag or motion pictures such as the biopic Basquiat or the art world satire (Untitled). Development of the character The assumed name, Hennessy Youngman, combines references to Henny Youngman, a comedian famous for \\"one-liners,\\" and Hennessy cognac, a popular drink in the hip-hop community. Youngman is often seen in his videos wearing a wide variety of elaborately decorated baseball caps and gold chain necklaces. The \\"Art Thoughtz\\" project began in early 2010. Hennessy Youngman gave a live performance of \\"Art Thoughtz\\" at The Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago on September 7, 2011 on the topic of how museums may receive millennial involvement. On May 14, 2012, Youngman appeared as a guest critic at Ted Byfield's Major Studio final critiques. In September 2012, \\"ArtInfo\\" magazine named \\"Art Thoughtz\\" one of the \\"100 Most Iconic Artworks of the Last 5 Years.\\"http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/826311/the-100-most-iconic-artworks- of-the-last-5-years There have been no additional published works under the Hennessy Youngman alias since May 16, 2012.  Art Thoughtz:s  = How To Be A Successful Artist = In the format of an instructional video, Youngman exposes the art world as a culturally white, male-dominated environment, impenetrable to minorities. = How To Be A Successful Black Artist = Similar to \\"Art Thoughtz: How To Be A Successful Artist\\", this video by Youngman also takes the format of an instructional video. This work differentiates itself by exposing the success of black artists to be reliant on conforming to stereotypes as hyperbolically as possible in Youngman's opinion. Youngman claims the white supporters of art do not want to be able to relate to works created by people of color. = Beuys-Z = Youngman introduces his Internet audience to the concept of \\"Personal Mythology\\" by comparing the work of artist Joseph Beuys and Jay-Z. By paralleling Beuys's story of being shot down in the Crimea when he was a fighter pilot with Jay-Z's tale surviving several shots fired at him at point-blank, among other examples, Youngman is able to establish a commonality between two otherwise disparate artists. = On Beauty = Under the premise of answering a fan's email, Youngman addresses the art and philosophy topic of aesthetics, more specifically beauty. Youngman looks at the contemporary works of Vanessa Beecroft, Leslie Tonkonow, Laurel Nakadate and Will Cotton through the analytical lens of 'beauty.' He directly contrasts the artists' works to photojournalism while disregarding possible contextual analysis through feminism or political interpretation. By applying a superficial analysis of the contemporary works through attribution, Youngman questions the current value of beauty and its role in art. = Grad School = Through the format of an infomercial, Hennessy Youngman voices his opinion on spending large sums of money to attend a graduate program for an MFA. Youngman speaks of his concern with the usefulness of art theory in the post-university job market. Youngman also comments on the usefulness of studio visits, presenting them as an inconvenience to the visitor and void of any real critique.

He was born in Landscape, County Cork, the son of Jonas Haynes and Hester Carmichael, and came to Victoria, British Columbia by way of Panama in 1858. Haynes and Thomas Elwyn were named special constables by James Douglas to restore order at Hills Bar following disturbances by gold miners there. Haynes next served as a constable at Yale. In 1860, he was asked to assist William George Cox at Rock Creek near the border with the United States. Later that year, Cox sent Haynes to Similkameen, where he established a customs house. In 1861, he was sent to Osoyoos Lake and he became deputy collector of customs in March of the following year. In 1864, he went to the Kootenay District as a justice of the peace and assistant gold commissioner. He was named to the Legislative Council in 1864. Haynes served briefly as district court judge at French Creek in 1866. In 1870, he was sent to Wild Horse Creek as magistrate and district court judge. Despite his complaints about the insufficient salary and inconvenience of the move, he served there until 1872. He then returned to Osoyoos as justice of the peace and was also employed in the federal customs department. Haynes acquired of land near Osoyoos Lake. He originally established a horse ranch but soon turned to cattle ranching, owning a herd of 4,200 cattle. Haynes was married three times: first to Julia, a native woman from Colville, Washington, then to Charlotte Moresby in 1868 and finally to Josephine Pittendrigh in 1875. Haynes died in Princeton at the age of 57. Haynes Point Provincial Park and Haynes Creek were named in his honour.

It is located in the North Goa District, Sattari taluka near the town of Valpoi. The sanctuary is an area of high biodiversity, and is being considered to become a Project Tiger tiger reserve because of the presence of Bengal tigers. Infrastructure The sanctuary is administered by the Goa State Forest Department. The range forest officer of Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is Vishwas Chodankar. The RFO office is near the Forest Department office in Valpoi. The sanctuary is protected by 11 forest guards under the supervision of three round foresters. The sanctuary is divided into 16 beats with the three round foresters stationed in Kodal, Charavane and Caranzol in Sattari taluka. The sanctuary office has a four-wheel-drive vehicle and a motorcycle for patrolling. There are no public tourist facilities in the sanctuary, but there are Forest Department rest houses at Valpoi and Keri. There is an Irrigation Department rest house above the Anjunem Dam. The Anjunem Dam is located on the Sanquelim - Belgaum highway SH-31 in Chorla ghat at about from Sanquelim town. There are three private ecoresorts in Chorla ghat, the Wildernest Nature Conservation Facility,Wildernest the Eco Adventure Resort,Ecomantra and the Swapnagandha Resort.Niva Geography Goa is the only state in India which has protected the complete Western Ghats' section within a state. Goa's four wildlife sanctuaries are located on the eastern side of the state in the Western Ghats, covering an area of about . The Mahdei Wildlife Sanctuary and Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park all fall within the Mhadei River basin. The Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is located between 15¬∞ 48\\" 33' to 14¬∞ 53\\" 54' N and 74¬∞ 20\\" 13' to 73¬∞ 40\\" 33' E. Elevations among the hills of the sanctuary range from in the center to in the west. The sanctuary includes the Vagheri Hills, some of the highest peaks in North Goa. Vagheri peak at elevation, the highest in the sanctuary, is near the village of Keri in Sanquelim. Other peaks in Goa include Sonsogor, the highest in Goa at , Catlanchimauli , Vaguerim and Morlemchogar. A unique discovery of the Vagheri hills is the presence of a flowing lake or waterbody shaped in the exact map of India, midway to climbing the hill while looking down at the valley. The Mhadei River, known downstream as the Mandovi River, the lifeline of the state of Goa, originates in Karnataka, travels in Karnataka, passes through the Mahdei Wildlife Sanctuary and meets the Arabian Sea at Panaji after traveling in Goa. See map showing rivers in Mhadei Wildlife sanctuary. =Waterfalls= Mhadei Sanctuary is noted for its many waterfalls, especially the twin Vazra Sakla waterfalls and the Virdi Falls in the Chorla Ghats region on the escarpment of the Goa-Maharashtra-Karnataka border in the Swapnagandha valley forest near Virdi village. The Vazra Sakla falls are one of the most distinguishing landmarks of the region. These water of these falls is fed by the Haltar nullah and joins the Valvanti River in Virdi village of Maharashtra. The Valvanti River then joins the Sakhali River and later meets the Mhadei River. The rock faces and cliffs that envelop the Vazra falls are home and nesting grounds of critically endangered long-billed vultures. The 16 waterfalls at up from Hivre village are from the Valpoi. The Ladkyacho Vozar plunge waterfall, northeast of Surla, Goa's highest village is at Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, and Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary is located just to the south of Mhadei in Goa. Fauna This region is part of the Western Ghats landscape, and is regarded as a Global Biodiversity Hotspot, as well as an area of high endemism by Conservation International. Other mammals seen in the sanctuary include the tiger, Indian black panther (rare), sloth bear (rare, occasional sightings near caves and grasslands), gaur (commonly sighted near the grasslands, in forest clearings, and near water), barking deer (commonly sighted near forest clearings and waterholes), sambar deer (occasionally sighted on grasslands and main roads), leopard (extremely rare), ruddy mongoose (frequently sighted at daybreak and dusk on forest paths), Asian palm civet (commonly sighted on main roads and near village settlements), small Indian civet (commonly sighted on main roads, dhole (rarely sighted transient mammal in the forests), jungle cat (extremely rare, sighted by researchers and locals on a few occasions), mouse deer (rare, occasional sightings on trails), wild boar (frequently sighted at dawn and dusk), Indian hare (commonly sighted on the plateaux), giant squirrel (documented in the forests), flying squirrel (a nocturnal mammal, documented in dense evergreen forests), black-faced langur (commonly found in small groups in the tree canopy), Indian pangolin (rarely found in secondary forests), slender loris (rare and endangered), bonnet macaque (commonly found in troupes). Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is an International Bird Area (IN177) which satisfies IBA criterion: A1. Globally threatened species, A2. Restricted-range species and A3. Biome-restricted species. IBA trigger species here are: Nilgiri wood-pigeon, Malabar parakeet, Malabar grey hornbill, grey- headed bulbul, rufous babbler, white-bellied blue-flycatcher and crimson- backed sunbird. A total of 255 bird species have been recorded in the Sanctuary. Of these, 53 showed direct signs of breeding here. Snakes found in the Mhadei Valley, including the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, include all of the \\"Big Four\\" venomous snakes in India: Indian krait, Russell‚Äôs viper, saw-scaled viper, spectacled cobra, plus: banded kukri snake, banded racer, Beddome‚Äôs keelback, black slender coral snake, brahminy blind snake, checkered keelback, collared cat snake, common bronzeback, common Indian cat snake, common sand boa, common wolf snake, common vine snake, copper-headed trinket snake, green pit viper, hump-nosed pit viper, Indian rat snake, Indian rock python, king cobra, Malabar pit viper, ocellated shield tail, ornate flying snake, red sand boa, Sri Lankan cat snake, streaked Kukri snake, striped keelback, Travancore wolf snake, tree snake, Whitaker's sand boa and the yellow-spotted wolf snake. Endemic species of amphibians in the sanctuary include the endangered marbled ramanella, the vulnerable Maharashtra bush frog, Beddome's leaping frog (Beddome‚Äôs Indian frog) and Malabar gliding frog. Mhadei area is known for three rare species of caecilians (legless amphibians), Nadkarni's caecilian, the Mhadei caecilian and the Goa caecilian which was recently discovered and described from Keri village. At least 257 recorded species of butterflies are found in the sanctuary of the 330 recorded species in the Western Ghats. The largest butterfly in South India, the southern birdwing plus the striped tiger, common jezebel, common Indian crow, blue Mormon and other species of butterflies can are found here. Prominent among these is the blue tiger butterfly, which can be found until the summer.

They traditionally render protection to a variety of flora and fauna. Copardem, three kilometres from Valpoi, is a village famed for the sacred grove tradition known locally as Devachi rai, a tradition of community conservation carried out in the name of the local deity. Formerly spread across of government land, much of the sacred grove is now encroached upon for cashew plantations and agriculture. The sacred grove is an excellent example of the old tradition of uneducated villagers protecting their environment. Among its variety of flora are towering trees such as shidam (Tetrameles nudiflora) which support various other life forms in the grove. Creepers like garkani (Entada scandens)Google Books with their sword-like pods are found on the shidam, while the tree also houses beehives. The grove also has an evergreen species of Ashoka, which bears unique saffron-coloured flowers. Pandanus furcatus,Google Books known locally known as kegadi, attracts village women when it bears flowers covered in yellow and soft thickets. During the monsoon, bioluminescent fungi growing on dead wood glitter at night. The grove is also conducive for the growth of a variety of edible mushrooms, such as roen alami, khutyali, sonyali and shringar. In addition to mammals, the tall trees attract birds, including the crested serpent eagle, Malabar grey hornbill and pied hornbill. Nanoda village, from Valpoi, has an ancient tradition of nature worship. It is etymologically related to the naked woman tree, locally known as the nano (Euphorbia tirucalli - pencil tree). Ancestors who lived in harmony with nature evolved the tradition of protecting the forest in honour of the local deity. Nanoda has two sacred groves named Nirankarachi Rai after the holy spirit Nirankar: one lies on the border of Maloli and Nanoda and the other in Nanoda. The latter is slowly being weathered away by changing values and encroachments. In the past, large areas of forest land were protected through sacred groves such as Nirankarachi Rai. One would find various species of indigenous trees in these groves and no one dared cut a tree. In this way, villagers ensured their protection. The densely forested groves were also used by villagers to keep sculptures of village deities. Today, because of encroachments, the size of the groves has decreased, while the sculptures lie exposed to the vagaries of nature. Nanoda's Nirankarachi Rai, formerly spread across a large area, is now confined to a small patch where the vulnerable species hedu (satinwood), khait (Mimosa catechu), and chafara (red frangipani) trees are found. Majestic trees such as bhillo maad (coconut) have already been felled. Inside the sacred grove are 15 stone sculptures-of Gajlaxmi, Mahishasurmardini, Ravalnath, Brahmani, a horse rider and warriors-which are a part of Goa's archaeological heritage, weathering away. Animals such as sheryo (pangolin) and shekaro (Malabar giant squirrel) are found in sacred groves. Threats Threats to the unique ecology and biodiversity of the Mhedai Wildlife Sanctuary include illegal heavy vehicular traffic mismanagement of private lands, illegal mining, tree-felling, monoculture plantations, industrial activities, poaching, and dams and river diversions, notably the Malaprabha Reservoir ProjectThe Hindu and The Kalasa-Banduri Nala project. Mhadei tiger reserve Bengal tiger in neighbouring Karnataka =Proposal= On 20 June 2011, Jairam Ramesh, Minister of State, Ministry of Environment and Forests, advised Digambar Kamat, Chief Minister of Goa, to propose the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the presence of resident Bengal tigers. The MOEF urged Goa to seriously consider the proposal because Mhadei is a 'contiguous tiger landscape' to Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka to its southeast and to Anshi Dandeli Tiger Reserve which has around 35 tigers to its southeast in Karnataka. Ramesh noted that the protected areas of Goa and their contiguous forests in Karnataka and Maharashtra are possibly some of the best tiger habitats in the Western Ghats and are in need of protection. Tigers are a conservation dependent species. He suggested expanding the tiger reserve beyond the existing Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. On 22 July 2011, National Board for Wildlife (NBW) member and conservationist, Prerna Singh Bindra, publicly supported the proposal to declare Mhadei wildlife sanctuary as a tiger reserve, stating that it will help secure the entire regions water resources. In a letter to chief minister Digambar Kamat, Bindra urged him to consider the merit of the proposal as suggested by Jairam Ramesh. \\"Mhadei is the catchment area of important rivers like Mhadei, Malaprabha, Pandhari, Bailnadi, Tillari, and making it a tiger reserve will help consolidate the habitat and address the water security issues of Goa for posterity,\\" On 8 August 2011, Goa Forests Minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues questioned the existence of tigers in the state. \\"It is not my job to know whether there are any tigers here.\\" Rodrigues also said, \\"the state government would not reply to a directive from former union environment and forests minister minister Jairam Ramesh asking the Goa government to submit a proposal for setting up a tiger reserve, unless specifically asked for. Why should we reply?\\" It is alleged that the Goa government's sluggishness to acknowledge the presence of tigers in Goa is linked to the state's Rs. 6,500 crore (US$ ~13,000,000.) mining industry, which rings the Western Ghats and most of the tiger terrain near the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. On 9 August 2011, there was public announcement that \\"in principle\\" approval was accorded by the National Tiger Conservation Authority for creation of a new tiger reserve at Mhadei Sanctuary. Under section 38V of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 the Goa state government was then authorised to notify Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve. There is considerable local community support for creation of the tiger reserve which would ensure long term protection of biodiversity-rich areas. In September, 2011, the Save Goa Campaign - UK initiated a petition addressed to The Goa Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Dr. Shashi Kumar, IFS, in support of Goa's first tiger reserve. =Tiger presence= The contiguous forests of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra including the wildlife sanctuaries of Goa in the Mhadei river valley, the Anshi Tiger Reserve and the reserve forests and wildlife sanctuary of Radhanagari in Karnataka, Chandoli National Park and the reserve forests of Purna and Dodamarg in Maharashtra have been named as Tiger Conservation Units (TCU) numbers 68 to 72, class: II (minimum habitat area to support 50 tigers or documented evidence of 50 tigers) and III (some information on threats and conservation measures is available, but not classified as Class I or II) by WWFInternational. The Mhadei region lies along the Vagheri hills which means \\"abode of tiger\\". In 2011, a map showing the locations of several tiger sightings in and near Mhedai Wildlife sanctuary was prepared by the Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade (VEAB) at Keri. On 24 January 2011 government officials and a senior environmentalist found pugmarks of a tiger adult and a cub near the Anjunem dam, confirming the presence of tiger in the area. Parshuram Kambli, working on the dam first reported the pugmarks. Residents living near the dam supported the claim, stating they have been hearing the tiger roar in the past fortnight. In December 2010, a local resident, Pandurang Gawas, and his son saw a tiger and cub crossing the road that passes alongside the dam. Also in 2011, the Goa Forest Department recorded tiger pug marks in this area during the Goa Wildlife Census conducted with the help of Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII). The 2010 National Tiger Conservation Authority tiger estimation described the Goa stretch of the Western Ghats as an important tiger corridor between Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve in Karnataka and the Sahyadris in Maharashtra, and confirmed occupancy of tigers in the state‚Äôs forests. In October, 2009 poachers were arrested near Mhadei with a tiger carcass and in recent years a live adult female tiger with a cub was sighted in the area. The staff of the Wildernest Resort at Chorla Ghat also sighted a tiger in the region in 2009. Also in the Chorla Ghat area, a part of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, there was a confirmed kill of a female domestic buffalo by an adult male tiger. Confirmation of the presence of a male tiger came to light after villagers from Chorla and surrounding areas reported sightings and viewed pugmarks in several locations in the Chorla Ghats. In May 2019, camera traps recorded tigers in this sanctuary and Mollem National Park, the first records in the state since 2013.

Life and career Boscawen was the third and youngest, but only surviving son of Admiral Edward Boscawen (1711‚Äì1761) by his marriage to Frances Glanville (1719‚Äì1805). In 1774 he joined the British Army as a cornet, but eventually reached the rank of colonel in 1795. Whilst serving as an officer he succeeded his uncle as Viscount Falmouth in 1782 and took his place in the House of Lords. He was the chief justice in the Eyre North of Trent from 1789 to 1790, when he was raised to the position of captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, serving in 1790‚Äì1806 and from 1807 until his death in 1808.

It takes its name from Zhenjiang in Jiangsu province. History Chinese legend ascribes the invention of the vinegar to Heita, a son of Dukang, one of the culture heroes credited with inventing alcoholic beverages in China's prehistory. Supposedly, Heita forgot a vat of wine for 21 days and, remembering it at dusk, found it pleasantly sour -- the legend is reflected upon the Chinese character ÈÜã, where ÈÖâ indicates \\"wine\\" and Êó• indicates \\"day\\". Historical records for the present vinegar can be traced back 1400 years. The primary producer of Zhenjiang vinegar at present‚Äîthe Jiangsu Hengshun Vinegar Industry Company‚Äîwas established in 1840. Production The label of a bottle of Chinkiang vinegar. Production of Zhenjiang vinegar begins when a vinegar pei mixture (wheat bran, rice hull, alcohol obtained from saccharification of glutinous rice and vinegar seed from a prior batch) is poured into an urn until the urn is half-full. The mixture is kept warm for up to 3 days in summer and 6 days in winter. At that point, rice hull is added and mixed in once per day until the urn is full. Salt is added and the urn is stored for up to 3 months during which it undergoes an aging process. The vinegar is then leached and the soaking liquid from water-soaked, parched rice is added as a color and flavor enhancer. The label in the photograph does not have any information about the percentage of acidity. The ingredients are listed as \\"water, glutinous rice, bran, salt, sugar\\" in English and French.

It includes e-mails, text messages, notes, calls, etc. Effective communication is critical in getting the job done, as well as building a sense of trust and increasing the productivity of employees. These may have different cultures and backgrounds, and can be used to different norms. To unite activities of all employees and restrain from any missed deadline or activity that could affect the company negatively, communication is crucial. Effective workplace communication ensures that all the organizational objectives are achieved. Workplace communication is tremendously important to organizations because it increases productivity and efficiency. Ineffective workplace communication leads to communication gaps between employees, which causes confusion, wastes time, and reduces productivity. Misunderstandings that cause friction between people can be avoided by effective workplace communication. Effective communication, also called open communication, prevents barriers from forming among individuals within companies that might impede progress in striving to reach a common goal. For businesses to function as desired, managers and lower-level employees must be able to interact clearly and effectively with each other through verbal communication and non-verbal communication to achieve specific business goals. Effective communication with clients plays a vital role in development of an organization and success of any business. When communicating, nonverbal communication must also be taken into consideration. How a person delivers a message has a lot of influence on the meaning of this one. Another important aspect to have effective workplace communication is taking into consideration the different backgrounds of employees. \\"While diversity enriches the environment, it can also cause communication barriers.\\" Difficulties arise when a coworker's cultural background leads him or her to think differently than another. It is for this reason that knowing about intercultural communication at work and learning how to treat others without offending them can bring several benefits to the company. Method of communication Different people absorb information in different ways. To make sure that the information conveyed is understood by all, the method used for communication must be simple, clear, and precise. When presenting vital information, using pictures can aid understanding. The presence of trust inside a corporation will also simplify the use of communication. Relationships must be established between coworkers to create a tension-free workplace. Messages should be sent and received with no alterations. To achieve healthy relationships in the workplace, behaviors such as bullying, taking credit for someone else's work and free riding should be avoided. These will create toxic relationships that will, in the long run, impact negatively a company and the productivity. Preferring two-way communication is considered best for communicating. Adequate importance can be given for discussion, questions and clarifications. Content The content of the information plays a major role in workplace communication. The level of detail must be according to the grasping capacity of the audience. Giving too much detail may get the audience bored and too little detail won't make them involved. Use of jargon while communicating is not considered good for effective workplace communication. Keeping information digestible by condensing the text from large chunks of information to quick, memorable snippets will keep readers engaged. Quick posts or emails can keep communication brief and allow for more consistent engagement. Providing visuals or interactive elements can support those who are visual learners. Frequency While formal workplace communication that is done too rarely or too often is not good for an organization, frequent informal workplace communication has its benefits. A perfect balance is required for the proper functioning of an organization. Information must be communicated as and when required rather than holding unnecessary meetings frequently. At the same time crucial information must not be held till the last hour or day, instead they must be communicated early to engage employees in the objectives of the organization. Skills Getting the message across efficiently depends on the skills of the communicator such as presentation skills, group facilitation skills, negotiation and written communication skills. Successful communication also depends upon the capacity of the employees to understand the information. This requires providing the employees some basic financial literacy like financial statements, sales, profitability, etc. When selecting a candidate, most employers seek for those who have strong speaking and writing skills. Problem solving and self- motivation are also highly necessary skills among the workplace. These allow rapidly changing environments to become less of a challenge. Tools With the fast evolution of technology, companies have to stay up to date with communication tools that facilitate the workplace communication. Some of these include email, blogs, instant messaging and even social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. It is important to keep in mind that sending an email, a fax or a letter does not necessarily mean that communication has taken place. Only when a message has been sent, received and understood by the intended receiver, it can be said that communication has occurred. Even though they facilitate communication, studies have shown that communication tools may distract employees from their duties. To reduce the interrupt effect, methods such as employee training and changing of environment can be implemented. Employees making themselves unavailable during specific times of the day or week can also help resolve this issue. This will increase concentration and as a result, productivity. Barriers Common barriers to effective communication at workplace: Physical barriers: Physical structure, location and construction of the workplace acts as a barrier to effective communication. Employees seated remotely from each other hinders effective interaction. Language barriers: Employees with different native languages will be working in an organization. As everyone in organization are not comfortable with native language of the other person, language acts as a barrier for effective workplace communication. Language barriers, such as differences in slang or register among second language speakers, within a workplace can create issues impeding proper work task completion. Cultural barriers: Employees from different cultures, following different practices will be working in an organization. This cultural diversity among the employees can act as barrier for effective communication at workplace. Emotional barriers: Emotional barriers like fear, inferiority, shyness, lack of self confidence and skills will stop an employee in communicating effectively with his colleagues. Perception barriers: Employees will have different experiences, values, preferences and attitudes. These may lead to a variety of assumptions and can act as a communication barrier.

His book Reasonable Doubt spent 15 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list From Grand Jury published by Ballantine Books in 1996 He is also the co-author of a nonfiction book about the Pilates Method, co-author of the screenplay for the Warner Brothers movie Rage, and a practicing attorney.  Education  Friedman received an AB in mathematics from Princeton University and studied mathematics as a Research Assistant at the Operations Research Center of the University of California, Berkeley, and at the graduate department of mathematics at Stanford University. He received a J.D. from New York University School of Law, where he won the American Jurisprudence Award in copyright law.  Career  Friedman and Dan Kleinman wrote a treatment for what became the screenplay for the movie Rage while in law school. The movie starred and was directed by George C. Scott. Friedman wrote a novel based on the same story, which was published by Atheneum Press and was a featured selection of the Literary Guild. A past member of the National Board of Mystery Writers of America, Friedman is the author of eleven other novels, including a series of legal thrillers that spent a total of 26 weeks on The New York Times' bestseller lists. Termination Order was selected for The New York Times‚Äô list of the Best Books of 1979 (now called Notable Books). Friedman's series about a squad of military investigators and troubleshooters, written under the name Philip Chase, was published as paperback-originals by Dell Books. Friedman is co-author with Gail Eisen of The Pilates Method of Physical and Mental Conditioning (1980), the first popular exposition of the Pilates Method, which distilled the method‚Äôs philosophy to the six essential principles that have been used worldwide to describe and teach Pilates. Vogue magazine called it ‚Äúone of our favorite exercise books.‚Äù Friedman's work for the stage includes the book for the unproduced musical comedy Hollywood, co- written with Peter Stern, with songs for the score written by composer Joe Reposo and lyricist Hal David, and a jazz version of The Mikado set in San Francisco, commissioned by producer Lee Guber for the Westwood Playhouse. From 1978 to 1990, Friedman was managing general partner of The High Frontier Company, a motion picture development company formed to produce a movie based on the book The High Frontier by Princeton physics professor Gerard K. O‚ÄôNeill and on O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs ongoing work envisioning the possibility of creating earth- like orbital habitations and replacing earth‚Äôs polluting power plants by orbiting solar satellites, all made from materials obtained from the moon and asteroids. In 1987, Friedman created a half-hour TV series, The Story of Billy Clay, for a joint venture of Reeves Entertainment and McGraw-Hill Publishers, under the auspices of the United States Information Agency. The series was intended to be both a TV drama and an aid to intermediate and advanced learners of English. Friedman wrote the pilot script and the‚Äùbible‚Äù for 26 episodes. The pilot was screened in 20 international cities, including Paris, Rome, Bogota, and Beijing. Friedman‚Äôs 1999 novel No Higher Law, the plot of which centered on millennial religious extremism, was published in the UK and Commonwealth market by Headline. Following 9/11, Friedman shelved the US manuscript indefinitely.

Despite his apparent lack of legal qualifications, he also had a successful career as a judge, becoming a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) and Master of the Rolls in Ireland. He also became a substantial landowner in the Pale, with his principal estate at Mornington, County Meath. His daughter Alice died in mysterious circumstances after a banquet in Dublin Castle in 1576, as did the Earl of Essex, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; they were both allegedly victims of poisoning, although it is more likely that each died a natural death.  Background  St. Chads Water, on the outskirts of Draycott, Derbyshire Draycott was a native of Denby in Derbyshire; his family name probably derives from the nearby village of Draycott. Little is known of his parents or of his early life. Despite his later eminence as a judge, it is not clear when he was called to the Bar or indeed if he was a qualified barrister at all. He is first recorded in Ireland in 1544; his first official post was as Treasurer of the Lordship of Wexford, and he received a lease of Crown lands in Wexford.  Administrator  Draycott quickly became a person of considerable influence in the Irish administration, and was appointed Chief Remembrancer, a senior position in the Court of Exchequer. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Naas in the Irish Parliament of 1560.Ball, p. 210 He was entrusted with a number of political missions to England, and was later a reliable supporter of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney; he was given the task of settling a controversy between the Earl of Ormond and the Earl of Desmond, and was involved in the settlement of Munster in 1567. Draycott was granted substantial properties in Counties Meath and Louth. His main estate was at Mornington in Meath; he also owned the manor of Donnycarney, near Drogheda, and property in Dundalk. Like most English settlers in Ireland he was indifferent to the rights of the original landowners, and was willing to assist other members of the settler class in \\"finding\\" (a euphemism for forging) title to land. In particular John Hooker, when he was acting as secretary to Sir Peter Carew, refers to the assistance Draycott gave to Carew in acquiring his Irish estates.Tazon, Juan E. The Life and Times of Thomas Stukeley Ashgate Publishing 2003 p. 86 Mornington, where Draycott had his principal estate.  Judicial career  Draycott was appointed a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1563 and Master of the Rolls in 1566. Although he gained a reputation for integrity, Elrington Ball queries his suitability for either office, since it is not clear if he had any legal qualifications.Ball, p. 141 However the Mastership of the Rolls was then more an administrative than a judicial office and Draycott was undoubtedly an efficient administrator; one of his principal tasks was to peruse, sort and classify the official records. Another objection to his appointment to high office was his chronic ill-health: in 1567 Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, described him as \\"a very sick and a weak man\\".Ball p. 141 He was chosen as one of the lessees of the King's Inn in the same year.Kenny, Colum King's Inn and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press p.57 Dublin 1992 He died in 1572.  Character  Despite his apparent lack of legal qualifications, Draycott has been praised as a judge who was noted for integrity, and as a man whose service to the Crown deserved commendation. Less admirable was his greed for acquiring land, not always by scrupulous means, and his willingness to help other settlers to acquire lands by similar underhanded transactions. Unlike most English settlers at this time he may have had Roman Catholic sympathies: though like all public officials after 1560 he was by necessity a Protestant in his outward observance, his family within a few years of his death became and remained open Roman Catholics. Queen Elizabeth I had a personal regard for Draycott, and on his death wrote that she was sorry to have lost one whom she esteemed as a good and faithful servant, but trusted that he had exchanged this world for a better one.Ball, p. 144  Descendants  Draycott was married and had at least three children: John, Alice and a second daughter whose first name is uncertain, who married Christopher Plunkett, a younger son of the Baron of Dunsany. His widow, Mary, remarried Owen Moore, the Muster Master for Ireland: in 1577 Owen was granted wardship of his stepson John and the right to arrange his marriage.Fiants of Elizabeth I 15 September 1577 John was knighted as Sir John Draycott. He married Anne Barnewall, daughter of Sir Christopher Barnewall and Marion Sherle, and had six children. =Death of Henry's daughter, Alice Draycott= Henry's daughter Alice died in mysterious circumstances after falling ill at a banquet in Dublin Castle in September 1576. Rumour had it that she was poisoned accidentally by assassins acting on the orders of the Earl of Leicester, who had supposedly been aiming for Leicester's enemy, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, who had drunk from the same cup as Alice, and also died soon afterwards. The autopsy on Essex found no evidence of poisoning, and it is most likely that both Essex and Alice died of dysentery. Several other guests at the banquet were also reported to have become seriously ill, but none of them claimed to have been poisoned.Weir, Alison Elizabeth the Queen Pimlico edition 1999 pp.302-3 Leicester's enemies habitually blamed him for the death of anyone he had a grudge against, but there appears to be no substance to any of these claims.Brooks E. St. John The Death of Alice Draycott (1954) Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society Vol 13 No. 2 p. 179 Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex: he and Draycott's daughter Alice were rumoured to have been poisoned by the Earl of Leicester =Later generations= Draycott's last direct male descendant, Henry Draycott of Mornington, died in 1694 without lawful issue: this led to a notable lawsuit, Draycott v.

The film stars Constance Cummings, Frank Albertson, Evelyn Brent, Dorothy Peterson and Hugh Herbert. Hugh Herbert's brother, Tom, made his screen debut with a small role in this film, billed as Tom Francis. Produced and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures, the film premiered in New York City on August 7, 1931, and was released nationwide the following week on August 15. It received mixed reviews from the critics. Plot While waiting to see the owner of the store who is potentially a new big client, Barry Greene, a traveling salesman, practices his sales pitch on Ellen Wilson. Unbeknownst to Barry, Ellen is the daughter of his potential client, J.C. Wilson. Her father, obsessed with business, has neglected his daughter. When she goes in to speak with her father, his usual lack of interest in her life causes her to decide to teach him a lesson by living a wild life. Angered by his daughter, when J.C. meets with Barry, he has no desire to listen to the salesman, and has him thrown out of the building. On his way out, Ellen offers him a ride to his hotel. En route, the two make a date for dinner that night. Back at the hotel, Barry's compatriots, all \\"traveling husbands\\" (married traveling salesmen), are enjoying a party with several call girls. One of the prostitutes, Ruby Smith, has fallen in love with one of the salesmen, Ben Hall. Barry has no interest in joining the party, despondent over his failure with J.C. This is exacerbated when Barry learns that his expense account has been put on hold until he can prove himself. Not being able to afford his dinner with Ellen, he calls her up and cancels their dinner date. Disappointed that her dinner has been canceled, Ellen is determined to have a good time that evening, and decides to go to the hotel for dinner by herself. When Ellen shows up at the hotel she attracts Ben's attention, who joins her for dinner. After dinner, in an attempt to awe her, Ben takes Ellen on a whirlwind tour of Detroit nightspots. When they arrive back at the hotel, Ben takes Ellen back to his room. When he attempts to force his attentions on her, her cries arouse several people, one of whom is Barry. When Barry bursts into Ben's room, an altercation occurs. In the dark, a gunshot is heard, and when the lights come on, Ben lies on the floor, shot. In the ensuing investigation, it is uncovered that Ruby shot Ben in a jealous fit of rage. Martha, Ben's wife, has arrived and reconciles with her husband. J.C. has also arrived, and realizes how he has ignored his daughter. He, Ellen and Barry leave the hotel together.

Released in 1954, it was the first musical film made in CinemaScope, and filmed in Warner Color. Plot Candy Williams (Doris Day) is a member of a struggling Vaudeville troupe that is stranded in Miami when creditors take all their money. After the troupe's leader Hap Schneider (Phil Silvers) tries to scam a restaurant out of dinner, they are forced to work in the hotel to pay for the meal. While cleaning a hallway, Flo Neely (Nancy Walker) hears Dick Carson (Robert Cummings) singing songs that are for his new Broadway show. She tells Hap and Duke McGee (Eddie Foy Jr.) that Dick is staying in the hotel. Candy has met Dick but believes he is a mechanic named Eddie. She arranges a date with him and is enjoying it when Hap joins them and spills the beans about Eddie being Dick Carson. Candy leaves thinking that Dick was trying to take advantage of her. To make up for the trouble he caused, Hap arranges a rehearsal of a new song so Dick can watch the troupe and audition Candy for his show. However, Candy thinks he is just trying to trick her again. He convinces her that he really wants her to star in the play. But his backer's daughter Lorraine Thayer (Martha Hyer) is jealous and says she will not let her father back Dick's show if Candy is in it. The troupe is leaving the hotel when Dick's manager reveals he is giving up the show and going back to New York. Candy realizes that Dick really loves her. She returns to her room and disguises herself to get into Otis Thayer's (Bill Goodwin) birthday party to perform Dick's songs and get Thayer's backing for the show.

It is endemic to southern New Guinea and occurs between Lake Yamur (West Papua, Indonesia) and Purari River (Papua New Guinea). Common name New Guinea frog has been coined for it. Description Papurana novaeguineae is the smallest Papurana species in New Guinea: males reach maturity below and females below in snout‚Äìvent length; these lengths have also been interpreted as the maximum sizes. Although it could be mixed with juveniles of other species, P. novaeguineae is easy to distinguish from its relatives because it has reduced webbing between the toes: the fourth toe has the last two phalanges free of webbing (one free phalanx or none in other species). The nostrils are relatively widely separated. The male advertisement call is a short series of pulsed notes with a \\"ringing\\" quality. The dominant frequency is about 3 kHz. Habitat and conservation Papurana novaeguineae occurs in tropical flooded savannas and foothill rainforests at elevations up to above sea level. It is locally abundant. Breeding takes place in permanent swamps and temporary grassy flooded ditches. No significant threats to this species have been identified. It occurs in several protected areas.

He was signed by the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent in 2012. He played college football at LSU. High school career Lee started his high school football career at Brownwood High School in Brownwood, Texas, where he completed 98-of-168 passes for 1,700 yards and 18 touchdowns operating out of a one-back offense. He also rushed for 250 yards and four touchdowns. Prior to his junior season, Lee transferred to Brenham High School as his father, Stephen, took a job on the staff as the wide receiver coach. Lee holds every major season and career passing record in Brenham High School football history. He finished with 6,182 career passing yards and 78 total touchdowns, more than doubling the previous record of 2,217 yards by Chip Matejowsky from 1985 through 1987. His 72 career touchdown passes eclipsed Charles Proske's next-best 28, and he is first and second for Brenham's single-season completion, attempt, touchdown, and passing yardage records. Most recruiting experts considered Lee one of the top three quarterback prospects in Texas, besides Ryan Mallett of Texas High School in Texarkana, Texas, and Brock Mansion of Episcopal School of Dallas. Recruiting analyst Tom Lemming compared Lee to former Sam Houston State quarterback Rhett Bomar. Lee had more than 30 scholarship offers from Division I schools, and chose to attend LSU over Nebraska, Kansas State, Oklahoma, and others on May 30, 2006. College career =2007 season= Lee was the third-string quarterback at LSU behind then-senior Matt Flynn and redshirted sophomore Ryan Perrilloux. Considering his age, Lee redshirted for the 2007 season. =2008 season= For the 2008 season, junior Ryan Perrilloux was projected to be the starting quarterback for LSU, but he was dismissed from the team for breaking team rules. Andrew Hatch started the first three games as quarterback, but was injured in the third game against Auburn. Beginning with the fourth game (Mississippi State), Lee started eight games as quarterback, compiling a 4-4 record. Three of the losses came against teams that were ranked #1 at some point during the year. Against Troy University, Lee led the largest comeback in LSU history taking an LSU team that trailed 31 to 3 in the 3rd quarter and scoring 37 unanswered points. An ankle injury ended Jarrett's season against Ole Miss, accounting for his fourth loss of the season. For the season, Lee threw an NCAA leading 7 interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. However, as one of only three freshman quarterbacks who have started more than six games for LSU, Lee put together one of the most prolific seasons for a freshman quarterback in LSU history, throwing for 1,873 yards and 14 touchdowns, second behind true freshman Tommy Hodson for yards and touchdowns. =2009 season= In his only start of the 2009 season, Lee completed 7-of-22 (32%) passes in a homecoming game win against Louisiana Tech, a member of the Western Athletic Conference. For the season, he completed 16-of-40 (40%) passes for 197 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. LSU's national rank in passing offense dropped from 71st in 2008 to 97th in 2009 with the replacing of Lee as the starter. =2010 season= LSU enjoyed a successful 11-2 season in 2010. Although Lee did not start any games, he was called on to lead game winning drives against Tennessee, Florida, and Auburn. He drove LSU down to the 2 yard line against Tennessee, threw a game-winning touchdown pass against Florida, but failed against Auburn. Against Alabama, he completed a critical 3rd down pass. For the season, Lee completed 54 of 89 (61%) passes for 573 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. After the conclusion of his junior season, Lee had appeared in 30 career games, and he had passed for 2,643 yards and 18 touchdowns. Although LSU's national rank in passing was 107th, LSU's national rank in rushing was 28th. =2011 season= Lee began the 2011 season as the starting quarterback because Jordan Jefferson was suspended for the first four games of the season. In the season opener against #3 Oregon, Lee helped lead LSU to a 40‚Äì27 victory although completing only 10 of 22 (45%) passes for less than 100 yards. Lee went on to lead the team to a 49‚Äì3 victory over Northwestern State, a 19‚Äì6 victory over Mississippi State, and a 47‚Äì21 victory over West Virginia before Jefferson was reinstated to the team. Lee continued to start, and win, for several more games, and fans were impressed with Lee's steady performance and leadership of the team. Lee had the second longest streak of consecutive passes thrown without an interception among all LSU quarterbacks, lasting from the fifth game in the 2010 season to the third game in the 2011 season. Despite Lee's commendable performance for most of the season, Lee was pulled for his poor performance in the November game against Alabama. Lee finished the game 3 of 7 (43%) for 24 yards with 2 interceptions and a passer rating of 14.5. Lee was 2 of 2 for 19 yards when Jefferson was substituted for Lee to pick up a third and one on the fifth play of the game. Following a Lee interception which led to a blocked Alabama field goal attempt, Jefferson came in for Lee again, played the rest of the first half, and started the second half. Lee was given another chance in the second half but immediately threw his second interception of the game which led to an Alabama field goal Following the Alabama game, the two quarterbacks were expected to rotate going forward; however, Lee saw very little playing time. The decision to give the starting role back to Jordan Jefferson was not without some controversy, and was questioned by some media and fans throughout the rest of the season. This criticism reached a peak after the rematch loss to Alabama in the National Championship game, where Lee did not enter the game despite a poor performance by Jefferson. LSU finished the game as the only team in BCS championship history to not score a point. This caused heated exchanges from some fans and media, with the sharpest public criticism coming from Bobby Hebert in a post-game outburst where he demanded to know why Miles did not put Lee into the game. Most people believe that Bobby Hebert‚Äôs embarrassing tantrum was motivated by the fact that Bobby Hebert‚Äôs son, T-Bob, did not play in the game. Lee finished the 2011 season with a passer rating of 152.0. Lee was selected by ESPN as the All-SEC senior team quarterback. A week after the BCS title game, Lee was invited to play in The Casino Del Sol All Star Game in Tucson. In the game, Lee finished 13 of 18 for 176 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. Lee played his second All-Star game in less than 1 week in The NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. In that game, Lee completed 2 of 6 passes for 36 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Thomas. =College career statistics= { border=0 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=0 style=\\"text-align:center; text-indent:1em;\\" - style=\\"background-color: #ddddff;\\" ! rowspan=2  Year !! colspan=9  Passing - style=\\"background- color: #ddddff;\\" !

Lee saw his first NFL preseason action in a game against the Green Bay Packers. He came in with 3:38 remaining in the first quarter and played the rest of the game. Lee was 15 of 22 (68%) for 235 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. Lee was less successful in his second pre- season game against the Minnesota Vikings. He came in late in the third quarter after most of the starters had left the game and was 5-of-12 (42%) for 81 yards. On the positive side, Lee led a 9-play, 53-yard final drive going 3 of 3 for 43 yards (not including a -6 yard sack), setting up the Chargers to kick the game-winning field goal with :04 left on the clock. Lee's final preseason game came against the San Francisco 49ers. He was 4-of-13 (31%) for 26 yards and a passer rating of 40.2. In his four preseason games, Lee was 24-of-47 (51.1%) for 342 yards and a passer rating of 73.2. Lee was waived by the Chargers on August 31, 2012. =BC Lions= On March 4, 2014, Lee signed with the BC Lions. He was released by the Lions on May 14, 2014.
