He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987. Life Spenser was born at Ghisburn, Yorkshire. His maternal uncle, William Horn, who signed for the Rectory of Cornwell, Oxfordshire, in 1559, sent him in 1573 to Trinity College, Oxford, where he became Fellow in 1579 and M.A. in 1580. There, convinced of the truth of Catholicism, he used his position to influence his pupils in that direction; but he delayed his conversion till 1582, when, with four other Trinity men (John Appletree, B.A., already a priest; William Warford, M.A. and Fellow, afterwards a Jesuit; Anthony Shirley, M.A. and Fellow, afterwards a priest; and John Fixer, B.A., afterwards a priest), he embarked from the Isle of Wight. They landed near Cherbourg, arriving at Reims, 2 November. Received into the Catholic Church five days later, he was ordained sub-deacon and deacon at Laon by the bishop, Valentine Douglas, 7 April 1583, and priest at Reims by the Cardinal Archbishop Louis de Guise, 24 September. He was sent on the English mission 29 August 1584. He effected the reconciliation of his parents and his uncle (the latter was living as a Catholic priest in 1593), and afterwards voluntarily immured himself in York Castle to help the prisoners there. He was condemned under 27 Elizabeth, c. 2, for being a priest, and executed at York. With him was executed a layman, Robert Hardesty, who had given him shelter.

It is inspired by sociological naturalism, and scientific naturalism's belief that the precision of natural sciences can be applied to social sciences, and hence to practical social activities like politics and law. It may be seen as a natural law-based version of legalism/constitutionalism (especially of prescriptive constitutionalism, in the way it tries, idealistically, to make a constitution how it should justly be), and it bears relation with many constitutional monarchies (as in that system they too believe in rule of the law and in certain things who are naturally correct (like monarchy, monarchic institutions and traditions. The roots of this legal political ideology may be found in positive visions of natural law (like John Locke's and Rousseau's, and even in the Founding Fathers of the United States.United States Declaration of Independence, 1776, \\"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\\" The Catholic German Centre Party politician and diplomat Karl Friedrich von Savigny also thought so.He stated that \\"laws are not made but found\\", implying the existence of already existing natural laws. Its main modern thinker is Egyptian legal scholar and creator of the Egyptian Civil Code Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri.Abd Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri, Egyptian Civil Code, Article 1, 1949, ¬´in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles, the judge shall have recourse to natural law and the rules of equity.¬ª Through the Egyptian Code, many other Arab constitutions (in monarchist and pre-dictatorships Iraq and Libya and modern Qatar) ended up including political naturalist laws, and Al-Sanhuri himself wrote the Syrian and Jordanian civil codes and the Kuwaiti commercial code.

Like the Croatian flag, it draws its modern roots from the period of the Austrian Empire, specifically from the Kingdom of Dalmatia. The coat of arms of Dalmatia - blue with three golden crowned leopard (lion guardant) heads - is never used on it, it is a simple yellow over blue bicolour without any emblem, as was custom of Austrian \\"landesfarben\\". The coat of arms was possibly sometimes set in it, but this was far from official. Bi-colour flag of Dalmatia was designed in 1802 and made for the first time made in 1803. The flag is officially in use as a flag of Kingdom of Dalmatia since 1822. when it was accepted by Royal Council in Zadar. After 1918. there was no administrative region of Dalmatia, and no flag was used. The Dalmatian counties of modern-day Croatia inherit blue and yellow colours, but no one has the right to \\"claim\\" the entire historical Dalmatian coat of arms. The coat of arms is, on the other hand, included in the Croatian coat of arms and the flag.≈Ωeljko Heimer, February 8 2002 However, mostly as souvenirs, the banners of arms of Dalmatia were sometimes used, and occasionally Italian groups with pretensions on Dalmatia, or those who left Dalmatia after World War II, used such flags in the last 50 years - always unofficially. An alternate version of the flag, featuring bleu celeste instead of azure, is almost indistinguishable from the modern flag of Ukraine, though there is no connection between the two.

He played two seasons in Major League Baseball for the 1961-62 Washington Senators. Baseball career Upon graduating from Belleville High School in 1956, Zipfel signed with the New York Yankees as a free agent. He steadily progressed through the Yankees' minor league system over the next five years, showing some potential as a big‚Äî tall and ‚Äîleft-handed-hitting first baseman. He exceeded the 20-homer mark twice, in the Class D New York‚ÄìPenn League (21 in 1958) and the Class A Eastern League (28 in1960). On December 14, 1960, Zipfel was chosen by the Los Angeles Angels in the 29th round of the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft and was then immediately traded to the expansion edition of the Washington Senators for infielder Ken Hamlin. The Senators sent him to the minor leagues, and he had his best statistical season in 1961 playing for the Syracuse Chiefs, batting .312 with 18 home runs over 101 games. Zipfel had an \\"impressive\\" spring training with the Senators in 1961, and after continuing his powerful hitting for a few months in the minor leagues, made his major league debut with Washington on July 26, 1961. He remained on the big league squad for the rest of the season as a backup 1st baseman, but his hot bat cooled, and he hit .200 with only 4 home runs over 50 games. Zipfel was drafted into the United States Marine Corps soon after the 1961 baseball season but completed his service in time to rejoin the Senators at the end of spring training in 1962. He began the season in the minor leagues and was recalled to the major league squad on June 26, 1962. Zipfel remained with the Senators for the rest of the season, splitting time between first base and left field. He again struggled to hit major league pitching, batting .239 with 6 home runs over 68 games. The highlight of his season was a 16th inning home run (the last of his major league career) that provided the winning margin in a game in which teammate Tom Cheney struck out a record 21 batters in a 228 pitch complete game on September 12. The Senators sold Zipfel's contract to the Cincinnati Reds at the end of the 1962 season. For the next four years, he played for minor league affiliates of the Reds, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, and St. Louis Cardinals. He was not recalled to the major leagues, and he retired from baseball after the 1966 season. After baseball Upon returning to his hometown of Bellevelle, Illinois, Zipfel became a successful real estate agent and developer.

Historically there are two main variants of these arms: *The most widely used version is: azure, with three crowned golden leopards' heads affront√©s caboshed Or, langued in gules (three golden lion heads, facing front, with golden crowns and red tongues, on a blue shield). This variant dates from at least the very late 14th century, found on the Great Seal of King Sigismund of Luxembourg (1395-1437). The Republic of Venice in its Great Arms (18th century) used a variant with the same charge, but on a gules (red) shield, with the tongues often gold rather than gules. Between 1815 and 1918, the crowned variant of this coat of arms, with the azure shield, was used by the Habsburg Kingdom of Dalmatia. And from 1868 until 1918 as part of the coat of arms of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in the upper dexter quarter. *Another, earlier version, was: gules, with three lion heads argent, facing dexter, langued and crowned OrKonrad von Gr√ºnenberg - Wappenbuch (1602-1604) (in German), accessed 24 July 2013Bayerische Staatsbibliothek M√ºnchen Wernigeroder (Schaffhausensches) Wappenbuch, accessed 24 July 2013Gelre Armorial - Gelre Folio 52v, accessed 24 July 2013Ulrich von Richental - Chronik des Konzils zu Konstanz (Chronicle of the Council of Constance, page 343), (in German), accessed 14 February 2014 (meaning three white or silver lion heads, with golden crowns and tongues, turned to left, on a red shield). This variant dates from the mid-14th century as part of the arms of Louis I of Hungary (1342-1382).

The heraldic leopard differs from the real-life leopard (Panthera pardus). It does not have any spots and often has a mane. Therefore, in heraldry, the leopard is generally similar, and is often referred to as a lion (Panthera leo). The reason for this lies in the fact that in the Middle Ages leopards were thought to be a crossbreed between a lion and a pard.

The Chief is appointed by the Foreign Secretary, to whom he directly reports. Annual reports are also made to the Prime Minister. The chief of the Secret Intelligence Service typically signs letters with a \\"C\\" in green ink. This originates from the initial used by Captain Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming, RN, when he signed a letter \\"C\\" in green ink. Since then the chief has been known as 'C'. History From 1782 until 1909, British intelligence at the government level was handled directly by the Foreign Office, with the Army and Navy also maintaining their own intelligence branches. By 1909, growing tensions with Germany led the Committee of Imperial Defence to recommend the creation of the Secret Service Bureau to provide organization and leadership to the intelligence-gathering process as well as a layer of insulation from espionage activities for the Foreign Office. A 10 August 1909 letter from Alexander Bethell to then-Commander Mansfield Smith- Cumming offered him a \\"new billet\\": the opportunity to head the Foreign Section of the new Secret Service Bureau. Smith-Cumming was to begin in this role on 1 October 1909, but bureaucratic and funding obstacles delayed the start of his work. His first full day in this capacity was not until 7 October, and even then, he \\"went to the office and remained all day, but saw no one, nor was there anything to do there.\\" Smith-Cumming's tenure as chief established many of the traditions and trappings of the office. Among the best known of these, he signed documents with the initial \\"C\\" in green ink, a custom upheld throughout the history of the service. One tradition that was not maintained was the selection of the Chief from the ranks of the Royal Navy. Although Smith-Cumming and Sinclair both had long Navy careers, Army veteran Stewart Menzies was appointed over naval officer (and Churchill's preferred candidate) Gerard Muirhead-Gould. Plans to rotate the selection of Chief among the various branches of military service were considered, but most subsequent Chiefs have been career intelligence officers. Although the existence of the Secret Intelligence Service, much less its Chief, was not officially acknowledged until 1992, the role's reality was an open secret for many years. In 1932, Compton MacKenzie was fined under the Official Secrets Act for elements of his book Greek Memories. Among these offences, according to Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip was \\"reveal[ing] the mysterious consonant by which the Chief of the Secret Service is known.\\" By 30 May 1968, however, The Times was willing to name Menzies as the \\"former Head of the Secret Intelligence Service\\" in his obituary. A 1989 House of Commons debate listed a number of publications in which information about the Chief and his organization had been revealed. The 1994 Intelligence Services Act established a statutory basis for the Secret Intelligence Service and the position of Chief. Since then, the office has had more public visibility, including a speech by John Sawers in 2010 described as the first of its kind. The Chief remains the only member of the Secret Intelligence Service whose identity is made officially public. A 2010 report revealed the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service was receiving a salary of ¬£169,999 at that time.

Alternatively, Udhen was also spelled \\"Uden\\", \\"Uzen\\", or \\"Awzan\\". Today, the local name is \\"Wazan\\". According to the village council of Beit Wazan, \\"Wazan\\" was the name of the wife of one of the village's former chiefs. Geography Beit Wazan is situated on a slope and its average elevation is 563 meters above sea level. It is located 4.56 kilometers west of Nablus city. It is adjacent to the Juneid and the Rafidia neighborhoods of Nablus, both of which are to its south. Nearby localities include Beit Iba and Zawata to the north, Tell to the south, Sarra to the southwest and Qusin to the west. History Archaeological findings indicate traces of Crusader settlement in Beit Wazan in the 12th century CE.Ellenblum, 2003, p. 224. =Ottoman era= Beit Wazan, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1596 the village appeared under the name Bayt Awzan as being in the Nahiya (Subdistrict) of Jabal Qubal, part of Nablus Sanjak. It had a population of 52 families and 4 bachelors, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and bee-hives; vineyards and fruit trees, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 13,000 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 136. In the 17th century, members of the Arab Bani Ghazi tribe migrated to Beit Wazan from Transjordan. The Qasim branch of the tribe established itself at Beit Wazan, as well as Deir Istiya, as their throne village from which they exerted power in the Jamma'in subdistrict of Jabal Nablus.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 184. The village contained the Qasim clan's palace, built in 1820, and was heavily fortified. The chief of the clan in the early 19th century, Qasim al-Ahmad, was the leading commander of the countrywide 1834 Peasants' Revolt in Palestine. When the Egyptian governor Ibrahim Pasha defeated the rebels of Jabal Nablus, he had Beit Wazan destroyed.Spyridon, 1938, p. 110 In 1838, Edward Robinson noted it under the name of Beit Uzin,Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 137 part of the Jurat 'Amra district, south of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 127 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine listed it as a village of the Jurat 'Amra subdistrict and called it Beit Udhen (Uden or Uzen). They described it as \\"a village rather smaller than Beit Iba, situated on the slope above it. It had a well on the east side, and a spring on the hill-side to the west.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 162 The residents of the village established commercial ties with the 'Asi family of Nablus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The people of Beit Wazan would sell 'Asi merchants onions for their stores in Nablus and the 'Asi would aid the people of Beit Wazan with commercial transactions in the city by negotiating prices down for goods, ranging from textile to copperware.Doumani, 1995, p. 88. =British Mandate era= Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in Palestine in 1917, the sheikhs living in the Qasim Palace abandoned it and moved to Nablus. The palace suffered severe damage as a result of the 1927 Jericho earthquake. It remained abandoned, although still owned by members of the Qasim clan. It is currently leased by the An-Najah National University of Nablus. In the 1922 census of Palestine, during British Mandatory rule, Beit Wazan had a population of 270 Muslims,Barron, 1923, p. 24 decreasing slightly to 253 in the 1931 census.Mills, 1932, p. 60 In a 1945 land survey, the village had 310 inhabitants, all Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 18 with 3,711 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

It is thought to have been made for a person close to the Imperial Court of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, and may have been used to hold scent bottles or jewellery. It was later kept in the Cathedral Treasury at Veroli, south east of Rome, until 1861. The casket is made of carved ivory and bone panels showing scenes from classical mythology. On the lid is a depiction of the Rape of Europa. On the front are scenes from the stories of Bellerophon and Iphigenia. On the back is part of a dionysiac procession, with two figures identified as Mars, god of war (the Greek Ares), and Venus, goddess of love (the Greek Aphrodite). The ends bear scenes of Bacchus, god of wine (the Greek Dionysius), in a chariot drawn by panthers, and a nymph riding a seahorse. There is a carcass of wood, and metal fittings. As the Empire had been Christianised for centuries, these pagan motifs presumably represent a revived taste for classical style and imagery. The casket from Veroli is one of some 43 caskets, in addition to dozens more separated panels, that show a fashion for \\"pseudo-antique motives derived from silver plate or manuscripts, put together with little understanding of the original significance,\\" as Sir Kenneth Clark observed of the group as a whole,Clark, The Nude: A Study in ideal form, 1956, Notes, p. 477. during the medieval eclipse of the nude.

Despite the planned economy, required materials and tools were not always available on time, and the work slowed as a result, or workers might have been reassigned to do something else, with the expectation that the job would be done when the materials arrive. However, when the end of a month neared, management was placed under pressure, substitute materials and improvised tools were used, and the workers were expected to produce the expected product in time. All this abruptly ended at the end of the month. At the beginning of the next month, the workers slacken to recover from the previous storm, thereby continuing the next cycle.Tinkering With Shturmovshchina (access 26 July 2011) The process is known to consist of three stages: * Spiachka ('hibernation\\", ) ‚Äì this was the first third of the planned period.

It was directed by Ralph Thomas and written by Peter Blackmore, who also wrote the 1948 film Miranda which preceded Mad About Men. Glynis Johns appears in both films as the mermaid Miranda. However, Rank Films insisted it was not a sequel. Mad About Men was filmed in Polperro, Cornwall and Long Crendon, Oxfordshire.A Touch Of The Memoirs by Donald Sinden. Hodder & Stoughton Publ. (1982), pp. 203-4 Plot When gymnastics school teacher Caroline goes on holiday at her family's home in Cornwall, she meets her distant mermaid relative Miranda, who looks exactly like her. She agrees to let Miranda trade places with her, while she goes on a bicycling trip with a friend. Caroline feigns an accident, which leaves her confined to a wheelchair for a few weeks and gets nurse Carey to attend to Miranda. This conceals the fact that Miranda has a fish tail instead of legs. Caroline is engaged to Ronald Baker, but when he shows up, Miranda does not like him at all. She decides to make Caroline a better match. She flirts outrageously with two eligible bachelors, Jeff Saunders and Colonel Barclay Sutton, right in front of Ronald. When she discovers that Ronald works in the government sanitation department (and approves of dumping garbage into the ocean), she dumps a tureen of cold soup on his head. Meanwhile, Barbara Davenport, the colonel's fianc√©e, takes an understandable dislike to Miranda. While out swimming, she discovers Miranda's secret and arranges for \\"Caroline\\" to sing at a charity concert, plotting to reveal her true nature. Caroline reads about the forthcoming concert during her holiday, guesses what Barbara intends, and rushes back to take Miranda's place, foiling Barbara's scheme. Afterward, Jeff takes Caroline boating. When he tries to kiss her, she resists at first, then willingly gives in, while a somewhat sad Miranda watches.

Analysis He has written about gender issues, including differences in wage rates between men and women, for publications such as the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. He has been critical of how the difference in pay has been measured and the conclusions drawn. For example, he argues differences in hours worked, education and having children should be accounted for. *See also: :: He has written that increasing the minimum wage may lead to job losses, criticizing a report by John Komlos who argued few jobs would be lost.Other citations:  Economist Jacob Vigdor later stated that Perry's analysis was carried out using faulty data; in response, Perry said \\"The jury is still out on the $15 minimum wage, [...] and it will take years to assess its impact. I'm simply pointing to some possible evidence in employment trends that might suggest that there is early evidence of some effects.\\" Affirming that the consumer confidence was a lagging indicator in econometrics, he criticised Obama's policies of demand market stimulation like the proposal of subsidizing electric and hybrid cars' sector, both for producers and consumers. Perry qualified public economic subsidies as a \\"boondoggle\\" and a severe market distortion, which would have been hindered the development of other alternative technologies such as hybrids and gasoline advanced engines. Civil rights complaint In June 2016 Perry filed a complaint with the Michigan Department of Civil Rights seeking the closure of Michigan State University's Women's Lounge, alleging that having a private place for women to study on campus discriminated against men, and was a violation of civil rights. He claimed the female only facility was a violation of both the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative and the equal opportunity in education act Title IX. In July of 2016, Michigan State University made the lounge a gender- neutral space to ensure compliance with Title IX.http://archive.is/Rfqn3 Selected publications  Notes External links * Profile at University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint Category:1966 births Category:21st-century American economists Category:Carlson School of Management alumni Category:George Mason University alumni Category:Living people Category:Mackinac Center for Public Policy Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:University of Minnesota alumni ","title":"Mark J.

The company produces circular sawing machines especially designed for sawing boards for the furniture industry. The company‚Äôs headquarters is in the town of Reszel (Warmi≈Ñsko-mazurskie province). History The enterprise was established in the middle of the 19th century as a foundry. In the period between World Wars I and II, the company manufactured agricultural machines and devices. After the annexation of Northern Lands in 1945 to Poland, the company was one of the first industrial plants activated in the territory of what was then Olsztyn Province. At first smithy begun to work in June 1945. In November 1945 the firm was taken over by the state-owned Northern Trust of Agricultural Machines in Gda≈Ñsk. Then, a new profile of production was opened: agricultural machines and machine tools for processing of peat. The company accepted its new name: State Factory of Agricultural Machines. Three years later the factory was assigned to Management of Local Industry in Olsztyn and changed its name to \\"Mechanical Plant and Foundry\\". Production then began to diversify further. The company started producing builder's hoisting winches as well as machines and devices for the manufacture of litter peat. On January 1, 1975, the firm was taken over by the Management of Industrial Machinery for Forestry and changed its name to Reszel‚Äôs Plant of Industrial Machinery for Forestry (being still a part of the Trust structure). In the period between 1953-62 the production program became extremely varied. Aside from a line of simple devices (wheeled sets, special benches, hoisting winches), there was also an assortment of high accuracy and precision products (air-compressors, tractors, hydraulic pumps, circular sawing machines). Since 1963, after the Trust decided to distribute production of machine tools for wood over several factories in Poland, the company began to specialise in the production of circular sawing machines, shredders and fragmentisers for processing wood and wood-based materials. From 1973 to 1985 the factory was intensively enlarged. A new foundry started production of cast iron. New productive halls were built and in 1983 a new division was opened in Bisztynek, producing farmer‚Äôs circular saws. In December 1990 the enterprise was transformed into legal form of Share Company, owned solely by the Treasury of the State, and changed its name to REMA S.A. (REMA Share Company).

The transparency creates a fair deal for all parties and is auditable if any twists around the deal should arise.  History  The concept is still not widely spread in the real-estate business, as it has only really been used from 2010 and onwards. From 2010 to 2014 there are some Lead User companies who have used this for their corporate real estate divestments. One example is A.P. Moller Maersk Group, who successfully have done this in North America, Latin America, and Europe.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyfT57fHOrM Sunday, February 23, 2020  The Concept  Buyers of real-estate are often presented with a situation where multiple buyers are interested in the same property. This creates uncertainties that can be split into: * Are there really other buyers? * What price is the winning price? * How many offers and time is needed? By utilising a forward e-auction for the conclusion of the sales process and deal only real and approved buyers participate, so no faking another bid or bluff is needed, which removes one of the uncertainties for the buyer. During the online auction the buyer can see the lead bid and will be able to adjust it as the auction progresses, therefore the winning price will be clear for all and the buyer will not have to guess what offers is the right to win. The time spend is usually not more than a couple of hours which means that if the auction is not won, the time spend is much lower compared to the conventional negotiations. The fact that it is an online auction the bidding can be done in front of any computer which minimises travel time to and from the real estate agent. Most common approach is to use a 3rd party consultant to ensure that the real estate agent can prove that the process have been conducted fair and that ethics of the online auction is maintained.

Outside Japan, with the exception of a few countries, the Storia was sold as the first generation Sirion. The name \\"Storia\\" is Italian for \\"story\\".  Overview  The 1998 Storia/Duet (called Sirion outside Japan) came with two petrol engines (with multi-point fuel injection): a 989 cc three-cylinder engine with and a 1.3 L four-cylinder engine with unit. Both were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. As of 2001, 1.3 L models have engines capable of accelerating from in 9.6 seconds and reaching a top speed of . This engine has an average fuel consumption of and the 989 cc models averaging . UK market only had the Rally versions of the Sirion: Rally 2 and Rally 4; the latter being the four-wheel drive version. The Rally models have a slightly increased engine output of and has a time of 8.1 seconds (8.9 seconds for Rally 4) and reaching a top speed of . The 4Track (or just 4WD outside Japan) is a four- wheel drive version of the standard 1.3 L model. The F-Speed is an automatic model which can be switched using a dashboard button to use push button sequential gear change on the steering wheel. A version called the Storia X4 was released for racing in Japan. This model has a four-wheel drive layout with front and rear limited-slip differentials and is powered by a JC-DET 713 cc engine producing . The use of a slightly enlarged kei car engine on the X4 was designed to meet homologation regulations for 1-liter racing class, which imposes a displacement multiplier for turbocharged engines, while allowing for larger body that is not constrained to kei car-size regulations. The Storia/Duet was restyled in 2000 with most changes to the front of the car, most notably the grille design. From the A-posts rearward, the design remained almost identical. The dashboard was also extensively redesigned with innovative use made of storage space and a more luxurious appearance. The Australian market only had the 989 cc model up until early 2001, when the sporty 1.3 L model, known as the GTvi, was added to the lineup. At the time, the GTvi model had the most powerful naturally aspirated engine available in its class, developing at 7,500 rpm. In Australia, a sequential transmission option was made available in the GTvi version only from 2002. This was an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission with sequential mode activated by a dashboard switch, then gear selection by buttons on the steering wheel. In December 2001, the Storia/Duet was restyled; the front grille and bumper were changed for a sportier appearance and in some markets the silver accents on the sides were removed (retained for the GTvi model in Australia). The dash and interior were redesigned, incorporating more storage spaces, easier to use controls and higher quality trim.

It was made for Gloucester Cathedral between 1104 and 1113, and is one of the outstanding survivals of English Romanesque metalwork. Description The candlestick was first modelled in wax, then cast in the \\"lost wax\\" technique in three sections. The metal is bronze in an unusual mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, and arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver - between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins. The candlestick was gilded by fire- gilding, with elements in niellod silver added, engraving, and tiny dark glass eyes inset on some of the figures.Noel Stratford in Zarnecki, pp. 232, 245 The candlestick is densely decorated with an openwork composition of human figures, apes and fabulous beasts interspersed between thick intertwined shoots of foliage. Three long-eared dragons with outspread wings form the supporting feet; the symbols of the Four Evangelists are in medallions on the knop. This type of decoration was common to northern European art of this date but the style here is closely related to contemporary English illuminated manuscripts, indicating that, despite German influences, this piece was made in England, possibly in Canterbury, or by a craftsman who travelled to perform commissions. He may not have worked exclusively in metal, and may well have been a layman.Noel Stratford in Zarnecki, pp. 232-233, 245 It has similarities to a pair of Ottonian candlesticks at Hildesheim which were commissioned by Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim, bishop from 993 until his death in 1022.Kennedy The decoration has been interpreted as a struggle between the forces of good and evil, and has speech and silence as a theme, with some of the figures placing hands over the mouths of others. An inscription round the outside of the drip pan reads \\"+ lvcis.on[us] virtvtis opvs doctrina refvlgens / predicat vt vicio non tenebretvr homo\\" (\\"This flood of light, this work of virtue, bright with holy doctrine instructs us, so that Man shall not be benighted in vice\\"), and some figures are crawling up through the decoration, towards the light, while others are making away from it downwards. There are three inscriptions in Latin. The one on the stem, above and below the central knop (or knob) refers to the donation of the candlestick and reads: 'The gentle devotion of abbot Peter and his gentle flock gave me to the church of St Peter at Gloucester' (\\"+ abbatis.petri.gregis / et:devotio.mitis/ + me dedit:ecclesie: / sci:petri:gloecestre\\"). Peter was Abbot of the Benedictine monastery of St Peter, now Gloucester Cathedral, from 1104 until his death in 1113. By perhaps the late 12th century, the candlestick was in Le Mans, where an inscription added round the inside of the drip pan records its donation to Le Mans Cathedral: \\"hoc cenomannensis res ecclesie pociensis / thomas ditavit cvm sol annvm renovavit\\" (\\"Thomas of Poch√© gave this object to the church of Le Mans when the sun renewed the year\\"). It is next recorded in a private collection there in 1856. The Candlestick was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum at an auction in Paris of the collection of Prince Pierre Soltikoff in 1861.Noel Stratford in Zarnecki, p. 245; Kennedy The Gloucester candlestick, as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum, are prominently featured in the novel The Children's Book (2009) by A.

It remains perhaps the most poorly-understood Silphium in eastern North America. It appears to show a high level of local variability throughout its range. This has historically been interpreted as a species complex, although recent treatments have often reduced these to variety rank, with some exceptions. Many specimens appear as intermediate or hybrids, which complicates study. Due to conflicting information about the best circumscription of the varieties, the taxonomy of this species remains unsettled.Flora of Missouri A 2015 treatment elevated Silphium gatesii, Silphium glabrum and Silphium trifoliatum from variety to species status.

The brand was introduced in 1922 by the original San Miguel Brewery. Since being acquired by Coca-Cola's Philippines unit in 2007, the brand has become the Philippine counterpart of Coca-Cola's Fanta brand. History A Spanish-language poster advertising beverages produced by the original San Miguel Brewery, including Royal fruit-flavored soft drinks (right), circa 1924. The Royal brand was first introduced in 1922 by the original San Miguel Brewery as its first non-alcoholic, carbonated beverage. In 1927, San Miguel became the first international bottler of Coca-Cola. The Royal brand became best associated with its orange-flavored soft drink, Royal Tru-Orange. In 1981, San Miguel spun off its soft drink business (its Coca- Cola franchise and the manufacture of Royal beverages) to a new company known as Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (CCBPI), a joint-venture with The Coca-Cola Company. The brand continued to be owned by San Miguel until 2007, when San Miguel sold the rights to the brand along with its entire interest in CCBPI to The Coca-Cola Company. CCBPI was renamed Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines, Inc. since January 2013 after the entry of Mexico-based Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de C.V until 2018.

Nearby towns are Angola and Fremont in Indiana, and Coldwater and Kinderhook in Michigan. A mill pond and dam built in 1923 is located at the south end of the lake, where the once-prosperous community of Jamestown is located. The mill was destroyed by fire before WWII but its foundations can still be found. The dam construction raised the water level to make three bodies of water into one unified lake. Dam ownership has been a point of contention between the residence of the lake and the State of Indiana. Important land features include Brown's Point, Kope Kon Point, and the Mill Pond. The lake is home to the international headquarters of the Inland Cat Class Sailing Association. Until recently, it was the world's largest single- class inland fleet and competitive racing occurred throughout the summer months. The 16' long sailboats with a single sail were built by residents who owned a Fort Wayne fiberglass company in the 1960s and 1970s. The Lake George Cottagers Association was established in 1927. The LGCA website is www.lakegeorgein.com. Cottagers have also established The Lake George Conservancy in the 2005 to protect surrounding land and to preserve the lake environs. Once almost exclusively surrounded by seasonal cottages which all It is commonly rumored that John Dillinger and members of his infamous bank- robbing gang hid out on a lake front home that still stands on the lake today on Lane 201A. The location was supposedly chosen due to its proximity to the Indiana-Michigan state line, making it easier for the gang to evade local police. The cottage belonged to Homer VanMeter, a prominent member of Dillinger's gang, who is buried in the Lindenwood Cemetery in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Lake George is approximately and is at its deepest point. There is significant historical evidence of Native American inhabitants living around Lake George. The lake is home to many species of fish, which were stocked by former deputy game warden and director of the Lake George Cottager‚Äôs Association, Fred Wiegman in the early 20th century. Early in its history, the Lake George Cottager‚Äôs Association obtained permission for fishing in the lake using either Michigan or Indiana fishing licenses. Today, the lake is a fishing hot spot for Bass and Northern Pike. In September of 2020, freshwater jellyfish were spotted for the first time in Lake George. The jellyfish, known by its Latin name Craspedacusta sowerbii, has been spotted in over 20 bodies of water in Indiana previously, and they are found throughout the world although they are supposedly uncommon. They are typically seen in late summer, but there appearance is sporadic and unpredictable. The jellyfish are only about the size of a penny and are translucent, making them difficult to spot.

A May 1943 report of the Intelligence Bureau of the Greek government in exile mentioned 33 active groups,ŒîŒôŒ£/ŒìŒïŒ£ (Army History Directorate): ŒëœÅœáŒµŒØŒ± ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒëŒΩœÑŒØœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑œÇ (1941-44) (Archives of the National Resistance), Athens 1998, Vol. 7, pp. 51-53 a number that increased to 79 in a joint British report of 17 October 1943.Greek Resistance Organisations and Connected Political Parties, Appendix A, WO204/8897; This report includes all active groups, including those gathered within the framework of EAM and others which co-operated closely According to some sources, the number was as high as 140. These numbers include groups of vastly different natures, which can be roughly divided in three categories: the major organizations, which displayed significant regional or nationwide action, including guerrilla operations against the Occupation authorities; the small political groupings, mainly active in Athens, with a limited following and engaged mainly in political propaganda and small-scale sabotage; and a small number of groups focused on intelligence and sabotage operations, in direct cooperation with the British secret services in the Middle East.  Major organizations  These were organizations with a political agenda, usually progressive, republican and with more or less socialist tendencies. They all developed guerrilla forces, but with the exception of the National Liberation Front, none succeeded in becoming a true nationwide mass movement and were confined to the regions where they were first established. = National Liberation Front (EAM) = The National Liberation Front (Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo, ŒïŒëŒú) was the largest organization, with a membership estimated between half and two million and maybe up to 150,000 fighters. It was formed on 27 September 1941 out of several leftist parties and organizations, such as the Socialist Party of Greece (Œ£ŒöŒï), the Union of People's Democracy (ŒïŒõŒî), and the Agricultural Party of Greece (ŒëŒöŒï), but the central role was played by the Communist Party of Greece (ŒöŒöŒï). From 1943 onwards, EAM came into increasing conflict with the other Resistance groups. The parties and organizations that functioned within EAM included: * the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), the movement's armed guerrilla wing * the Greek People's Liberation Navy (ELAN), the auxiliary naval force of ELAS * the National Labour Liberation Front (EEAM), which functioned as EAM's trade union * the National Solidarity (E.A.), EAM's welfare wing * the United Panhellenic Organization of Youth (EPON), EAM's youth wing, formed from the amalgamation of ten leftist youth organizations in February 1943 * the Organization for the Protection of the People's Fighters (OPLA), the Communist Party's paramilitary security force * the Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front (SNOF) = National Republican Greek League (EDES) = The National Republican Greek League (Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Syndesmos, EDES) was the second- largest organization, founded on 9 September 1941. Its military wing, the National Groups of Greek Guerrillas (EOEA), were active mainly in the Epirus area, but part of its political wing in Athens engaged in collaboration with the Nazis. Included: * the National Groups of Greek Guerrillas (EOEA), military wing * the Northern Epirus Liberation Front (MAVI), a branch based in Albanian territory under the leadership of Vasilios Sahinis = National and Social Liberation (EKKA) = The National and Social Liberation (Ethniki kai Koinoniki Apeleftherosis, EKKA), founded by Dimitrios Psarros, was the smallest and last of the three main Resistance groups to be formed, in the autumn of 1942. Its military wing, the 5/42 Evzone Regiment was active mainly in eastern Central Greece before its bloody dissolution by ELAS troops in April 1944 and the murder of Psarros. = YVE/PAO = The Defenders of Northern Greece (Œ•œÄŒµœÅŒ±œÉœÄŒπœÉœÑŒ±ŒØ ŒíŒøœÅŒµŒØŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ, YVE) was founded by a group of Greek army officers in July 1941. Its membership was drawn mostly from the pre-war military and the still functioning state administration, and politically belonged to the right, professing loyalty to the Greek government in exile and King George II. YBE initially focused on smuggling fighters into the Middle East, where they were to join the Free Greek Forces of the Greek government-in-exile, while its main goal was halting Bulgarian encroachment in Macedonia. In early 1943, YVE was transformed into Panhellenic Liberation Organization (PAO) and embraced armed struggle after being encouraged by agents of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) to assist them in the execution of Operation Animals, an Allied diversionary operation. PAO participated in the Battle of Fardykambos, but shortly came into conflict with ELAS. ELAS emerged victorious and the remnants of PAO began operating under the umbrella of the Security Battalions organized by the collaborationist government in Athens, committing numerous atrocities. = National Organization of Crete (EOK)/ Supreme Committee of Cretan Struggle (AEAK) = The first armed resistance group in Crete, the Supreme Committee of Cretan Struggle (AEAK) was founded in June 1941 in Chania shortly after the end of the Battle of Crete. It was headed by Andreas Papadakis, Ioannis Paizis, Andreas Polentas, Titos Georgiadis and Ioannis Ioannidis. It closely collaborated with the SOE, supplying it with fake documents through the German appointed mayor of Chania and double agent Nikolaos Skoulas. AEAK was dissolved in February 1943 and transformed into the National Organization of Crete (Ethniki Organosi Kritis, EOK) in June of the same year. It was headed by Skoulas, Charidimos Polychronidis, Iosif Voloudakis, Emmanouil Basias and Markos Spanoudakis. Despite their ideological differences, EAM and EOK agreed to sign non-aggression pacts during the meetings of Theriso (7/11/1943) and Tromarissa (15 September 1944).  Minor groups  These groups were confined to Athens and its suburbs, and engaged primarily in political propaganda, through the publication of various proclamations and newspapers. In terms of membership, they were small, centered around a leader, with members largely drawn from his family and friends, and often overlapping with other groups. Generally, their members were young, and the political programs they espoused were mostly republican and socialist. There were, however, exceptions, such as the groups formed by royalist army officers. = Panhellenic Union of Fighting Youths (PEAN) = The Panhellenic Union of Fighting Youths (PEAN) was perhaps the most active of the small urban resistance groups. It was founded in October 1941 by the Air Force Lieutenant Kostas Perrikos. Aside from its political activities, PEAN is most notable for carrying out two of the largest urban sabotage acts of the entire Occupation: the bombings of the pro-Nazi Organisation of the National Forces of Greece (OEDE) and National-Socialist Patriotic Organisation (ESPO) organizations in August and September 1942. Although the main core of the group was soon after betrayed to the Germans and executed, the organization continued to function, albeit largely limited to a purely political role, until Liberation. \\"ŒüŒπ Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒøœÅŒ≥Œ±ŒΩœéœÉŒµŒπœÇ œÜœçœÑœÅœâŒΩŒ±ŒΩ œÉŒ±ŒΩ ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒπœÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒ±\\" article in the Eleftherotypia newspaper, 8.4.2006 = Army of Enslaved Victors = The Army of Enslaved Victors (Stratia Sklavomenon Nikiton, SSN) was founded by Kostas Perrikos, Andreas Gyftakis and Nikolaos Mylonas in June 1941 and published its first proclamation in October of that year. At that point, Perrikos left the group to found PEAN. From December 1942, SSN published its own paper, \\"Greater Greece\\" (Megali Ellas). = Sacred Brigade = The Sacred Brigade (Iera Taxiarchia, IT) was founded also by Kostas Perrikos in June 1942, but appeared openly on its own only in August 1942. Closely cooperating with PEAN and the \\"Omiros\\" group, it printed its own newspaper, the monthly \\"Hellenic Youth\\" (Ellinika Neiata), with over 3,000 copies. In June 1943, it fused with PEAN. = Hellenic Army = The Hellenic Army (resistance organization) (Ellinikos Stratos, E.S.) was formed by ex-Army officers, and aimed to reconstitute the Hellenic Army. It did not succeed to extend its activities beyond the Peloponnese, however. =Military Hierarchy= Alexandros Papagos during 1943 established with other Army officers, a resistance organization, the Military Hierarchy. In July of the same year, however, he was arrested by the German occupation authorities and transported to Germany's concentration camps as a prisoner. = RAN = RAN (Rumelia-Avlona-Nisoi) was another small armed urban resistance group, based in Athens. It was under the command of the Venizelist general Konstantinos Ventiris. During the Dekemvriana it fought with the government forces against EAM-ELAS. Its acronym derived from its post-war territorial claims, i.e. (Eastern) Rumelia, Avlona (and Northern Epirus) and the Italian-occupied Dodecanese Islands. = Battalion 122 = Battalion 122 (Tagma 122) was a resistance group created by Greek American volunteers in 1944. The number 122 in the name of the Battalion was a symbolic number, symbolized the years from the beginning of the Greek revolution of 1821. \\"Œó ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒµ œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∫œâŒ¥ŒπŒ∫œå ¬´122¬ª\\" , article in the Kathimerini newspaper, 07.06.2014  Intelligence and sabotage groups  These were small organizations, which functioned mainly in the big cities. They were not politically active, but focused solely on obtaining intelligence on the Axis forces in Greece, as well as carrying out several sabotage missions and helping Allied military personnel to escape to Middle East or to the neutral Turkey. Most of these were led by former military officers, and functioned under the supervision of either the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) or the Inter-Services Liaison Department (ISLD) of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). = Bouboulina = The \\"Bouboulina\\" group was founded on 10 May 1941 by Lela Karagianni and her family and named after Laskarina Bouboulina, a heroine of the Greek War of Independence. Initially, the group focused on helping Allied soldiers to flee to the Middle East. Gradually, the group established an effective intelligence network, engaged in sabotage acts and was collaborating with EDES of Napoleon Zervas. It also smuggled 80 Jews to Turkey. However, on 11 July 1944 Karagianni was betrayed and arrested, being executed two months later. = Omiros = The \\"Omiros\\" (\\"Homer\\") group was founded in September 1941, and established contact with the ISLD in April 1942. Active in the wider Athens area, including the harbour of Piraeus, Corinth and Thessaloniki, it eventually spread over much of the Greek mainland. It was led by Colonel Stylianos Kitrilakis and Lt Colonel Konstantinos Dovas, both of whom would rise to significant positions in the post-war royalist establishment. Another notable member was Stylianos Pattakos, later member of the Greek junta of the Colonels. = Maleas and Aliki = The \\"Maleas\\" group (named after Cape Malea) was founded in late 1941 by Navy Captain Alexandros Levidis, and was initially focused on aiding the escape of British servicemen to the Middle East. Eventually, in October 1942, the group was split in two: \\"Maleas 1\\", under the control of ISLD, with Commander Evgenios Valasakis as its head, carried on with the intelligence- gathering operations, while \\"Maleas 2\\" under Levidis continued to aid the escape of Allied personnel, in cooperation with MI9. \\"Maleas 1\\" was later renamed to \\"Syrios\\" (\\"the Syrian\\") and finally to \\"Aliki\\" (\\"Alice\\"). From August 1943, it was under the direction of Commander Konstantinos Hasiotis. = Kodros = The \\"Kodros\\" group (named after King Codrus) was founded in October 1942 by the retired Lt Commander Panagiotis Lykourezos. It was the third group under ISLD control, and was active mainly in the Athens area. = Odysseus and Prometheus II = The two agents \\"Odysseus\\" and \\"Prometheus II\\" had been enlisted by the Special Operations Executive already before the outbreak of the war, and were the service's main Greek operatives in occupied Greece. \\"Odysseus\\" was the codename of Gerasimos Alexatos, a professional smuggler, while \\"Prometheus II\\" was Navy officer Charalambos Koutsogiannopoulos. Alexatos made frequent trips to Turkey, acting as a courier and bringing back money, instructions and equipment. Later, his team would act as the liaison between SOE and EAM, while the \\"Prometheus II\\" team took on the liaison with EDES. \\"Prometheus II\\" continued to function until its radio team, together with Koutsogiannopoulos, was seized by the Germans on 3 February 1943. = Apollo = The \\"Apollo\\" (Apollon) group was founded by Ioannis Peltekis, a member of \\"Prometheus II\\" who had fled to Turkey upon that organization's destruction by the Germans. He soon returned to Athens, authorized by SOE to create a new group. Under his direction, \\"Apollo\\" became one of the largest intelligence organizations in wartime Europe, with over 500 agents. Peltekis quickly succeeded in freeing Koutsogiannopoulos from jail, and his organization provided the British with accurate information on Axis shipping, air defenses and aircraft deployments, smuggling downed Allied pilots (and after the Italian surrender, high-ranking Italian officers) out of the country, as well as engaging in extensive sabotage activity. = Organization X = The Organization X (), commonly referred to simply as X (\\"Chi\\" in Greek). Xwas founded in 1941 by Colonel Georgios Grivas, a Greek Cypriot by birth with the intention of gathering intelligence for the Allied cause, minor anti-German actions and transport of volunteers to the Middle East. However, with the EAM's meteoric rise to prominence within the Greek resistance movement, X shifted its attention towards combating EAM and other affiliated communist groups. Following the Italian surrender to the Allies in September 1943, X began purchasing weapons from the Axis authorities, later welcoming hundreds of members of collaborationist organizations such as the EEE and Security Battalions who sought to avoid persecution as liberation seemed imminent.

In early 1589 he went with Father Henry Garnet to the West Midlands, visiting Coughton, Warwickshire and settling at Baddesley Clinton. He then worked chiefly in Worcestershire for 17 years. Oswald Tesimond assisted him after 1596; Father Thomas Lister, another Jesuit, also supported Oldcorne's mission but found the requirements of the covert life difficult. Oldcorne sometimes stayed with Thomas Abington, whose house at Hindlip Hall was near Baddesley Clinton. There he converted Thomas's sister Dorothy. The house was then was adapted by Nicholas Owen to help conceal Catholic priests.'Parishes: Hindlip', A History of the County of Worcester: volume 3 (1913), pp. 398-401. Date accessed: 6 July 2008. From 1601 to 1605 On 3 November 1601, Oldcorne went on a pilgrimage to St Winefride's Well at Holywell in north Wales to obtain a cure for a cancer of the throat. The cancer cleared up and in 1605 about thirty people returned with him to give thanks for his recovery. Amongst this group were the priests Oswald Tesimond, Ralph Ashley, and Henry Garnet, as well as Nicholas Owen and John Gerard . Also in the group was plotter Everard Digby and his wife, whose priest was Oldcorne. The timing of this second pilgrimage and the people involved later aroused suspicion. The government investigation used this gathering as circumstantial evidence to implicate some of those there in the plot. Aftermath of the Plot When the Gunpowder Plot was discovered, Oldcorne was at Hindlip Hall, his base for fourteen years. In December, he was joined there by Nicholas Owen, Henry Garnet and Ralph Ashley who were hiding because they were under suspicion of involvement. Hindlip was searched in January but the four were not discovered: Garnet and Oldcorne were in one hiding place while the two lay brothers were in another. Their conditions were poor, and after eight days they surrendered. Oldcorne was arrested with Garnet by Sir Henry Bromley and held briefly at the castle at Holt in Worcestershire before being taken to the Tower of London. It has been said that Bromley would have abandoned his search much earlier but he had information from Humphrey Littleton that Oldcorne and possibly Garnet were hiding there.Humphrey Littleton , Gunpowder-plot.org accessed 7 July 2008 thumb Trial and execution Oldcorne was tortured, but no evidence was found to connect him to the Gunpowder Plot. He recounted under interrogation that on 8 November 1605 there arrived Tesimond from Robert Wintour's who told Mr (H)Abington and himself that \\"he brought them the worst news that they had ever heard, and they were all undone.\\" Tesimond said that certain people had intended to blow up the parliament house but they had been discovered a few days before it was meant to happen.Criminal Trials by David Jardine, 1846, accessed 6 July 2008 Edward Oldcorne and Nicholas Owen, engraving by Gaspar Bouttats.

It had distinguished itself by opposing interference by the Turkish military in the country's social and political affairs. It was distributed nationwide, and had been in circulation since November 15, 2007. On July 27, 2016, the newspaper was closed under a statutory decree during the state of emergency after the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt, due to its alleged links with the coup plotters' G√ºlen movement. Overview Taraf has published a series of highly- controversial stories that revealed the involvement of the Turkish military in daily political affairs. The revealed documents, such as coup plans that involved the bombing of historical mosques in Turkey (\\"Sledgehammer\\" coup plan) and bombing of a museum (Operation Cage Action Plan), significantly damaged the social image of the Turkish military. The sources that leaked such critical insider information to Taraf are still unknown. The response of the Turkish military to Taraf included canceling the newspaper's accreditation from press releases at its headquarters. A political journal, Nokta, had similarly published leaked military information (Sarƒ±kƒ±z, Ayƒ±≈üƒ±ƒüƒ±, Yakamoz and Eldiven) and was closed down in 2007 due to pressure. The founder and owner of Taraf, Ba≈üar Arslan, dismisses accusations of bias and outside funding, saying that he has made a considerable loss in his mission to create what he calls the country's most prestigious newspaper. He considers Taraf an investment that will eventually pay off. Some prominent names of Taraf, such as reporter Mehmet Baransu, columnist Emre (Emrullah) Uslu, and former columnist √ñnder Ayta√ß are known for their affiliation with the G√ºlen movement, although it has been denied that they act as quasi-officials representatives of the movement. Taraf also served the interests of the G√ºlen movement in other ways, including silencing the allegations of cheating in compulsory public servants‚Äô examinations in Turkey. History In 2011 Taraf became the first Turkish partner of the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, joining internationally known publications in signing a contract to publish the site's leaked documents firsthand. The Turkish daily was picked by WikiLeaks because it is \\"the bravest newspaper in Turkey\\", as described by the site's founder, Julian Assange.Turkish daily to publish WikiLeaks cables on Turkey , Today's ZamanTurkish newspaper Taraf signs contract with WikiLeaks, H√ºrriyet Daily News, 16 March 2011 On 14 December 2012, founding editor-in-chief Ahmet Altan, his assistant editor Yasemin √áongar, columnists Murat Belge and Ne≈üe D√ºzel stepped down from their posts at the newspaper.

The squadron operated during the Second World War. History =Pre- war= The squadron was upgraded to use the Fairey Seal aircraft, and then embarked aboard with the Home Fleet in May 1933. The Abyssinian crisis in August 1935 caused the squadron to be briefly transferred to the Mediterranean, but it returned to the UK in February 1936. It then transferred its Seals to 822 Naval Air Squadron and received as replacements Blackburn Shark IIs, which it used to take up the role of Torpedo Spotter Reconnaissance. By September 1937 the Sharks had been replaced by Fairey Swordfish and the Squadron transferred to the new aircraft carrier in November 1938. They sailed to the Mediterranean in spring 1939, and as war loomed they were transferred to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939. =Second World War= Operating off Ark Royal the squadron was responsible for the first allied U-boat kill of the war, when they sank , after she had unsuccessfully tried to torpedo Ark Royal. The squadron sailed with the carrier to the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean, searching for German shipping and commerce raiders.

The squadron was used to attack enemy positions, but on 21 June an attempt was made to sink the . The squadron sustained heavy losses in this unsuccessful operation and was forced to disband in December. A single flight, X Flight, continued in service though, with six aircraft. They sailed to Gibraltar aboard and then to Malta aboard HMS Ark Royal. They covered the Malta Convoys, before being absorbed in 815 Naval Air Squadron. 821 Squadron was re-formed at Detling in July 1941, initially tasked with carrying out anti-submarine duties in Orkney. In November they were transferred to Egypt, and in March 1942 they were re-equipped with six Fairey Albacores. They carried out bombing raids on Rhodes, and in Egypt were active in supporting ground forces at Maaten Bagush, Gambut and Daba. 821 Squadron was transferred again in November 1942 to operate out of RAF Hal Far, on Malta, attacking enemy supply convoys headed to North Africa. Four of the squadron's aircraft were transferred to Castel Benito, Tripoli in March 1943 to support night bombing raids by the Royal Air Force in Libya. In July 1943 at the time of Operation Husky, 821 squadron was based at Hal Far on Malta with Albacores for torpedo/spotter/reconnaissance. The entire squadron then transferred to Tunis in June to attack enemy shipping. 821 Squadron returned to the UK by October and was disbanded again. It reformed again in May 1944, this time equipped with 12 Fairey Barracuda IIs and operating as a torpedo bomber reconnaissance squadron. The squadron was embarked aboard in November and sailed to the Far East. They carried out mine- laying operations in February 1945, with Barracuda IIIs, and from April with six F4F Wildcats until June 1945. The squadron was active until February 1946.

It then came under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, which continues to the present. No longer retained for regular worship, services are nevertheless held twice annually, on St George's Day and Christmas Day. History The history of St. George's Church began in August 1753. A committee of Portlanders was formed to decide whether to put further finances into the dilapidated St. Andrew's Church or to erect a new church at a more accessible position. St. Andrew's suffered from an unstable site and was prone to landslips (notably those on the east side of Portland in 1665 and 1734). Within two months a decision was made, with a survey of the old church finding that repairs would be at least half the cost of a new building. A year after the completion of the church, a house was built nearby for the parish clerk, and this building would become The George Inn. The church was closed in 1914 for many reasons, and fell into further disrepair ever since that time. In the 1960s however, the church fell under the protection of a newly formed group, the 'Friends of St George's Church', who were able to restore the church. Now no longer needed for regular worship, the church is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 16 April 1970, and was vested in the Trust on 27 October 1971. Architecture View of St George's Church from the south Designed by architect and quarry merchant Thomas Gilbert, St George's is regarded as one of the most impressive 18th-century churches in Dorset. It is a large church built of Portland stone and has a tower, a nave, transepts, an apse, and a kind of 'abortive dome' over the crossing. The design is reminiscent of the works of Christopher Wren (particularly the tower, in relation to those of St Paul's Cathedral). The windows are arranged in two tiers, all with simple, broad raised frames that lack moulding. Architect John Vanbrugh called the result \\"a masculine show\\". It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. Gilbert was also the architect of a number of houses within the local area, including the Grade II* Listed Queen Anne House, his own residence built circa 1720.

He carved his first sculpture from a riverside rock at the age of 11, both ruining his father's chisels and gaining his respect. After beginning his career in California and later moving to New York, he returned to California's Big Sur area in 1946, set up a studio in his home and gained a wider following. He lived and worked at his Big Sur property, Pfeiffer Ridge, with partner Brooks Clement, until Clement's 1973 death from cancer. In 2008, actors Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry met Norman, purchased land from him in Big Sur, became his neighbors and close friends -- eventually taking five years to produce a documentary on his life. Norman died September 24, 2009 in Monterey, California at age 91, survived by three sisters, Marilyn Bogart, Mabel Malone and Edna Rhodes. Career and work Norman began his professional career designing window displays for the Bullocks Wilshire department store in Los Angeles. He later moved to New York to design window displays for department stores including Bergdorf Goodman and Bonwit Teller -- his work featured in Vogue and other periodicals. In 1946, he designed ornate headgear for performers in the 1946 Hollywood musical Blue Skies. On a trip to Europe, he discovered an affinity for working with plastics, especially epoxy resin, which would ultimately become a mainstay of his work. His work was featured in a Manhattan gallery in 1944 and subsequently covered in the New York Times -- noting Norman's innovative use of plastic as decorative rather than functional material. The show received positive reviews and quickly sold out. In his work, Norman was known to use a technique combining admixtures of epoxy, crushed glass, plastic, and wood to create a cloisonne or stained glass effect. He also layered the material over wax forms, which were subsequently melted to leave a 3-dimensional sculpture. The Nob Hill Masonic Center in San Francisco, California, mosaic window and exterior stone sculptures by Norman His body of work includes sculptures, mosaics, panels, and jewelry -- notably the 40-by-46-foot mosaic window for the Nob Hill Masonic Center in San Francisco, depicting the founding of California Freemasonry. The Monterey Herald described the mural as an endomosaic, incorporating thousands of bits of metal, parchment, felt, linen, silk, natural foliage, thinly sliced vegetable matter, shells and sea life, plus 180 colors of stained glass.\\" Documentary In 2006, PBS aired the documentary, Emile Norman: By His Own Design, covering much of Norman's life. The documentary featured, Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry, actors known for their roles on the NBC television series, L.A. Law. The couple were friends and neighbors of Norman having purchased land from him in Big Sur. The film incorporated footage shot by Norman's partner Brooks Clement on a hand-cranked 16mm Bolex.

An Alien Priory As an alien priory (i.e., the dependency of a French mother-house) Andover would have had a certain inbuilt instability of status before the English crown, especially whenever there were hostilities between France and England, and particularly during the Hundred Years' War. Its fate would have shared the fluctuating fortunes of every alien priory. At the dissolution of alien priories in 1414 the priory was granted to Winchester College. The college was obliged to pay yearly pensions of forty-five marks to the Crown, twenty marks to Joanna of Navarre, the widow of Henry IV and fifty- two marks to the ex-prior, Nicholas Gwyn. A piece of ivy-covered wall next to the present parish church is believed to be the only surviving remnant of the priory.

She was the wife of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who served four successive kings as Lord Marshal of England. Her marriage had been arranged by King Richard I. Family inheritance Daniel Maclise's painting of the marriage of Isabel's parents, Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and his wife Princess Aoife of Leinster in August 1170, the day after the capture of Waterford. Isabel was born in 1172 in Pembrokeshire, Wales, the eldest child of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (113020 April 1176), known to history as \\"Strongbow\\", and Aoife of Leinster, who was the daughter of Diarmait Mac Murchada, the deposed King of Leinster and M√≥r ingen Muirchertaig. The latter was a daughter of Muirchertach Ua Tuathail and Cacht ingen Loigsig. The marriage of Strongbow and Aoife took place in August 1170, the day after the capture of Waterford by the Cambro-Norman forces led by Strongbow. Isabel's paternal grandparents were Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and his wife Lady Isabel de Beaumont. She had a younger brother Gilbert de Striguil who, being a minor, was not formally invested with either the earldom of Pembroke or of Striguil. It is unlikely that his father could have passed on the title to Pembroke as he himself did not possess it. When Gilbert died in 1185, Isabel became Countess of Pembroke in her own right (suo jure) until her death in 1220. In this way, she could be said to be the first successor to the earldom of Pembroke since her grandfather Gilbert, the first earl. By this reckoning, Isabel ought to be called the second countess, not the fourth countess of Pembroke. In any event, the title Earl was re-created for her husband. She also had an illegitimate half-sister Basile de Clare, who married three times. Basile's husbands were: Robert de Quincy; Raymond Fitzgerald, Constable of Leinster: Geoffrey FitzRobert, Baron of Kells. Isabel was described as having been \\"the good, the fair, the wise, the courteous lady of high degree\\". She allegedly spoke French, Irish and Latin.Turtle Bunbury (2000). History, Heroes and Villains, William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, 1147-1219Crusader, Templar, Kingmaker. An article. Retrieved 2010-10-29. After her brother Gilbert's death, Isabel became one of the wealthiest heiresses in the kingdom, owning besides the titles of Pembroke and Striguil, much land in Wales and Ireland. She inherited the numerous castles on the inlet of Milford Haven, guarding the South Channel, including Pembroke Castle. She was a legal ward of King Henry II, who carefully watched over her inheritance.  Marriage  The new King Richard I arranged her marriage in August 1189 to William Marshal, regarded by many as the greatest knight and soldier in the realm. Henry II had promised Marshal he would be given Isabel as his bride, and his son and successor Richard upheld the promise one month after his accession to the throne. At the time of her marriage, Isabel was residing in the Tower of London in the protective custody of the Justiciar of England, Ranulf de Glanville. Following the wedding, which was celebrated in London \\"with due pomp and ceremony\\", they spent their honeymoon at Stoke d'Abernon in Surrey which belonged to Enguerrand d'Abernon. Marriage to Isabel elevated William Marshal from the status as a landless knight into one of the richest men in the kingdom. He would serve as Lord Marshal of England, four kings in all: Henry II, Richard I, John, and Henry III. Although Marshal did not become the jure uxoris 1st Earl of Pembroke, Earl of Striguil until 1199, he nevertheless assumed overlordship of Leinster in Ireland, Pembroke Castle, Chepstow Castle, as well as Isabel's other castles in Wales such as the keep of Haverford, Tenby, Lewhaden, Narberth, Stackpole. Shortly after their marriage, Marshal and Isabel arrived in Ireland, at Old Ross, a settlement located in the territory which belonged to her grandfather, Dermot MacMurrough. A motte was hastily constructed, a medieval borough quickly grew around it, and afterwards the Marshals founded the port town by the river which subsequently became known as New Ross. The Chronicles of Ross, which are housed in the British Museum, described Isabel and Marshal's arrival in Ireland and records that Isabella set about building a lovely city on the banks of the Barrow. In 1192, Isabel and her husband assumed the task of managing their vast lands; starting with the rebuilding of Kilkenny Castle and the town, both of which had been damaged by the O'Brien clan in 1173. Later they commissioned the construction of several abbeys in the vicinity.Turtle Bunbury The marriage was happy, despite the vast difference in age between them. William Marshal and Isabel produced a total of five sons and five daughters. =Issue= * William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (11906 April 1231). Chief Justiciar of Ireland.

Tintern Abbey, the burial place of Isabel de Clare  Legacy  Isabel died in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1220 at the age of forty- eight. Her husband had died the year before. She was buried at Tintern Abbey, Monmouthshire. However, a cenotaph was discovered inside St. Mary's Church, New Ross, Ireland, whose slab bears the partial inscription \\"ISABEL: LAEGN\\" and her engraved likeness.JSTOR: The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Vol.78, No (July 1948), p.65. Retrieved 2010-10-29. It was suggested in 1892 by Paul Meyer that Isabel might have encouraged the composition of the Song of Dermot, which narrates the exploits of her father and maternal grandfather. However, the Song of Dermot as now known was composed a few years after her death (though based on earlier writings). Although her daughters had many children, Isabel's five sons, curiously, died childless. This is supposedly attributed to a curse placed upon William Marshal by the Irish Bishop of Ferns, Albin O'Molloy. The title of marshal subsequently passed to Hugh de Bigod, husband of Isabel's eldest daughter Maud, while the title of Earl of Pembroke went to William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke, the husband of Joan de Munchensi, daughter of Joan Marshal. He was the first of the de Valence line of the earls of Pembroke. Within a few generations their descendants included much of the nobility of Europe, including all the monarchs of Scotland since Robert I (1274-1329) and all those of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom since Henry IV (1367-1413); and, apart from Anne of Cleves, all the queen consorts of Henry VIII.

In early 2007, one of Iraq's main armed groups had confirmed a split with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), according to a spokesman for the dissenting organisation. The Islamic Army, however, reached a ceasefire\\" with AQI on June 6, 2007, yet still refused to sign on to the Islamic State of Iraq\\".Ghosh, Bobby. \\"A Truce Between U.S. Enemies in Iraq\\", Time, 6 June 2007. Background The initial split between the Islamic Army and Al-Qaeda in Iraq dated back to 2005, with some small reports of splits and even armed clashes. In the summer of 2006 increasing rifts began to open between local Sunni tribes and insurgent groups (including the Islamic Army), and al-Qaeda. The main focus of these rifts was dissatisfaction with Al-Qaeda and its tactics, particularly the heavy and deliberate targeting of civilians by foreign Al- Qaeda fighters. In September 2006 this growing anger led to the establishment of the Anbar Salvation Council by 30 tribes, who then sought US support in fighting Al-Qaeda in Anbar. Using the Al-Anbar Salvation Council as a model, CLCs were armed and trained by the U.S. military to patrol their communities and act as neighborhood watch groups. What began as the Al-Anbar Awakening [Salvation Council] later evolved into the formation of concerned local citizens' groups present in almost every major neighborhood in Baghdad and throughout the provinces. In mid-October 2006, al-Qaeda announced the creation of Islamic State of Iraq (ISI),Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq, St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , p.183 replacing the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC) and its al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Conflict =Emergence of conflict= Actual fighting between the various groups had begun by early 2007, with groups fighting Al-Qaeda for control of their local communities. The fighting saw Al-Qaeda targeting groups critical of it, with Al-Qaeda bombing a Sunni mosque in Fallujah in February 2007, and assassinating the leader of the 1920 Revolution Brigade. February 2007 also saw Misha'an al-Juburi, who owns a television channel used as a propaganda channel by the IAI, attacking Al-Qaeda in Iraq, particularly over the groups attacks on civilians, rival insurgent groups, and the Iraqi security forces. =Al-Qaeda's conflict with the 1920 Revolution Brigades= The 1920 Revolution Brigades announced on 27 March 2007 that its leader, Harith Dhahir Khamis al-Dari, had been killed in an ambush by al-Qaeda in Abu Ghraib. Dari was the nephew of Harith al-Dari, the exiled head of the Muslim Scholars Association. The 1920 Revolution Brigades had allegedly been in talks over working with the Anbar Salvation Council. Dari had long been targeted by Al-Qaeda due to his refusal to pledge allegiance to the ISI Emir, Omar al- Baghdadi. Following Dari's death the Brigades announced its split into two factions‚Äîthe 1920 Revolution Brigades and Hamas of Iraq. The break was the result of differing viewpoints on working with the al-Anbar Salvation Council, negotiating with coalition forces and the relationship vis-√†-vis Al-Qaeda's Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). =Open conflict= Fighting magnified in the Spring of 2007. In early April the Islamic Army severed its ties with ISI after claiming that its members had been threatened by the group. Later in the month, the Islamic Army accused the ISI of killing at least 30 Islamic Army fighters, as well as members of Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna and the Mujahideen Army. In the face of escalating conflict, the Islamic Army called on Osama Bin Laden to personally intervene to reign in al-Qaeda in Iraq. In May 2007 the Anbar Salvation Council claimed to have killed Abu Ayyub al-Masri, which was dispelled by an audio tape released by the group in response, which also denied claims of fighting between the various groups. In late May 2007 US forces released dozens of Iraqis who had been tortured by Al-Qaeda as part of its intimidation campaign. By June open gun-battles between the various groups had reached Baghdad. =Breakdown in the ceasefire= Whilst the Islamic Army and Al-Qaeda had agreed on a ceasefire in June 2007, reports circulated of fighting between the Islamic Army and Al-Qaeda around Samarra in October and November 2007. Coalition forces later claimed the operations involved Iraqi and Coalition personnel, as opposed to the Islamic Army. Some news outlets at the time also reported, despite Islamic Army objections, that the Islamic Army had begun working with the Coalition as part of the wider awakening.

It was formed in 1950 from the facilities of the United States established during World War II in Northeast Canada, Newfoundland and Greenland. It was discontinued in 1957. History =Origins= The Northeast Air Command (NEAC) was originally formed from the World War II facilities of the United States Army Newfoundland Base Command (NBC), which formed on 15 January 1941. The NBC was formed to command bases in Newfoundland which came under United States control as a result of the 1940 Destroyers for Bases Agreement; the 1941 US-Danish Agreement on Greenland, and the development by Air Transport Command of airfields in the Canadian Northwest Territories and Greenland to support aircraft ferry routes to Great Britain. Newfoundland Base Command Emblem of the Newfoundland Base Command In the summer of 1940, President Roosevelt began negotiating with British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian for the American lease of British bases, the \\"rental\\" to take the form of fifty over-age destroyers. On 2 September 1940, the negotiations were completed. In exchange for the destroyers, the U. S. got ninety-nine-year leases for bases in Dominion of Newfoundland, Bermuda, British Guiana, Antigua, Trinidad, St. Lucia, Jamaica and the Bahamas. The detailed lease agreements were not signed until March 1941. But by that time, American troops were already in Newfoundland. The first United States troops arrived in Newfoundland on 29 January 1941. The first base occupied was a temporary tent camp near St. John's called Camp Alexander. Nearby Fort Pepperrell (renamed Pepperrell Air Force Base on 16 June 1949) received its first troops in November 1941. The Newfoundland Base Command (NBC) was assigned to the Northeastern (later Eastern) Defense Command, a subordinate continental defense command of First United States Army, whose area included the east coast of the United States, with both commanded by Lt. General Hugh A. Drum, based at Fort Jay in New York City. In December 1941 the Northeastern Defense Command became the Eastern Theater of Operations (ETO) and assumed First Army's role in continental defense. In March 1942 the ETO was renamed the Eastern Defense Command. The NBC was under the direct control of US Army General Headquarters for U.S. Troops in Newfoundland in the defense of the northeastern seaboard through First Army/Eastern Defense Command. The Base Command was responsible for its own supply, which was to be provided by the Second Corps area, the service of supply organization also headquartered at Fort Jay, to the same extent as for units of the field forces. NBC provided ground, antiaircraft, and harbor defense of U.S. bases in Newfoundland and Labrador, to work with Canada in defending Newfoundland, and to cooperate with the United States Navy in Newfoundland defense. Newfoundland Base Command was headquartered at Fort Pepperrell, St. John's, Newfoundland. Another major base was Naval Station Argentia. The first USAAF presence in Newfoundland was in May 1941 when six B-18 Bolos from the First Air Force 21st Reconnaissance Squadron arrived at RCAF Station Gander. Later, the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFAC) used both Gander and RCAF Station Torbay near St. John's for antisubmarine patrols over the North Atlantic and to provide convoy overflights over the shipping lanes, patrolling for U-Boats. Both Canada and the United States built radar stations in Newfoundland. Beginning in the spring of 1944, the American stations were phased over to the RCAF so that American personnel could be moved to more active theaters. Greenland Base Command Emblem of the Greenland Base Command Greenland Base Command HQ Sign, about 1943 While the exchange of destroyers for a string of Atlantic bases was under negotiation, and then, while plans and preparations for developing the new bases were getting under way, Great Britain and Canada were consolidating their position in the North Atlantic by stationing troops in Iceland and were attempting to counter German activities in Greenland. With United States bases were under construction in Newfoundland, a number of possible sites for airfields in Greenland were made in late 1940. Greenland being a Danish colony with Denmark under the occupation of Nazi Germany at the time. These surveys were made with the justification that the defense of the American bases in Newfoundland and of the northeastern United States would be affected by a German military air base in Greenland. Neither the United States, nor Canada or Great Britain desired any Wehrmacht facilities or armed forces in Greenland to obtain weather data. During the summer of 1940 Nazi Germany had organized in Norway a number of expeditions for the purpose of establishing radio and weather stations in northeastern Greenland, in the neighborhood of Scoresby Sound. Although manned, it would seem, by Norwegians and Danes, and led by a Dane, these weather stations were under German control and were operated for the purpose of assisting the German naval and military effort. A mixed British-Norwegian landing party seized a supply of aviation gasoline, dismantled several radio stations, and took into custody a number of heavily armed Danish \\"hunters\\" found on the coast. This was in late August or early September 1940. A few weeks afterward the British intercepted another vessel off the coast of Greenland with about fifty Germans, some of them meteorologists, on board. All this activity at the top of the Western Hemisphere was a source of much concern to the United States. In addition to seizing German ships and weather equipment on Greenland, the British and Canadians were planning on building air bases on the island to conduct antisubmarine warfare in the North Atlantic. Although the United States Government had acquiesced in the British garrisoning of Iceland, it had no desire to see Britain make the same move into Greenland; for Greenland was, unlike Iceland, definitely within the Western Hemisphere and within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine. The Department of State reached an agreement on 9 April 1941 with Danish Foreign Minister, Henrik de Kauffmann, acting on behalf of His Majesty the King of Denmark in his capacity as sovereign of Greenland. The agreement recognized that as a result of the European war there was danger that Greenland may be converted into a point of aggression against nations of the American Continent by Nazi Germany. The agreement, after explicitly recognizing the Danish sovereignty over Greenland, granted to the United States the right to locate and construct airplane landing fields and other facilities for the defense of Greenland and for the defense of the North American Continent. As soon as the agreement with the Danish Government was concluded, President Roosevelt authorized the War Department to go ahead with the preparations for building airfields and other facilities in Greenland. $5 million in funds previously allocated for constructing the bases acquired from the British in the Bases for Destroyers agreement was re-allocated to Greenland. On 30 June construction of the first U.S. Army and Navy base in Greenland, code-named Bluie West I began. Greenland Base Command (GBC) was established on 1 September 1941 with headquarters at Bluie West I to take charge of the U.S. forces and facilities being planned. By the end of September 1941, when the contractor's people arrived, the troops at Bluie West I had erected 85 buildings, about two-thirds of the total needed for the initial force, and had begun to install the necessary utilities. They had built three miles (5 km) of access roads, constructed a temporary dock, and started work on the airfield. By the time the civilian construction force arrived they had finished grading one of the two runways and had a metal landing mat partly laid. Bluie West I was thus one of the earliest U.S. Army airfields, if not the first, to make actual use of Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) in runway construction, an important engineering development and one that afterwards contributed greatly to the winning of the war, particularly in the Pacific. After the arrival of the civilian construction force the engineer battalion, reinforced by a company of the 42nd Engineers (General Service), concentrated exclusively on airfield construction. They continued to do so until February 1942 when the civilian force took over this work as well. By then the first runway was ready for limited use. Construction work on a second west coast base further north, at Sondrestrom or Bluie West Eight, began in September 1941. A third field was placed on the east coast almost directly across from BW-1 at Angmagssalik In addition, the United States obtained rights to build bases in Greenland. In July 1941, a task force of service troops arrived at Narsarsuaq. This site had been chosen as a major staging base between Labrador and Newfoundland. Work began at once on the base, which was given the code name Bluie West One (BW-1), and the first plane set down on 24 January 1942. Work on a second west coast base further north, at Sondrestrom or Bluie West Eight, began in September 1941. A third field was placed on the east coast almost directly across from BW-1 at Angmagssalik (Bluie East Two). An interesting contribution to the defense of Greenland was the Northeast Greenland dog sledge patrol organized in the summer of 1941 as a joint endeavor of the Army, the United States Coast Guard, and the Greenland Government. All the activity on the east coast the year before had demonstrated the ease with which anyone could establish a foothold in the vast Arctic wastes, the near impossibility of finding a hostile force that had established itself, and the difficulty of dislodging one, once it was discovered. An air patrol of the east coast, even after the new bases were completed proved its worth by assisting in the capture of the trawler Buskoe on 12 September, as that vessel, a small German-controlled Norwegian ship, was attempting to establish a radio and weather station in the Mackenzie Bay area. In addition to the Army Airfields, the United States Navy Atlantic Fleet established a number of stations on Greenland to support radio, weather, and naval patrols as part of the Battle of the North Atlantic against German U-Boats and the protection of Allied convoy traffic in the North Atlantic. Air Transport Command Emblem of Air Transport Command In 1941, the United States established a series of northern airfields and weather stations across the Canadian Northwest Territories and Labrador with the approval of the Canadian government. The original mission of these airfields and stations was to aid in moving military aircraft to Great Britain as part of the Lend- Lease Act prior to American entry into World War II. The Canada-U.S. Permanent Joint Board on Defence made the plan official as Recommendations 17 and 26 in July 1941 and June 1942 respectively. First referred to as the \\"North East Staging Route,\\" it eventually became known as the \\"Crimson Project\\" or \\"Crimson Route\\", supposedly after the Red Cross who were using the same route for medical evacuation of wounded soldiers from the European Theatre. As an alternate to the previously developed base at Gander Lake in southern Newfoundland, the Canadian government in September 1941 began the development of Goose Bay in Labrador. During the preceding July the United States had sent engineers to Narsarssuak in Greenland for the building of the air base that came to be known as BLUIE WEST 1 (BW-1), and in the following September work began on BW-8, a much more northerly base on the western coast of Greenland. United States forces had taken over the defense of Iceland in July 1941, where they improved airstrips previously occupied by the RAF and began in the spring of 1942 to build two new air bases (Meeks and Patterson) near Keflavik. The eastern terminal lay at Prestwick in Scotland. When the Eighth Air Force began its movement in the summer of 1942, work was still in progress all along the route. At that time it was hoped that some of the disadvantages of the existing route might be overcome by developing a more northerly airway extending from Great Falls, Montana, across Canada to Hudson Bay and thence by way of Baffin Island to Bluie West Eight in Greenland. In Canada, airfields were established at The Pas and Churchill in Manitoba; Southampton Island and a site code-named Crystal II in the Northwest Territories. These airfields, along with airfields in Iceland, Greenland and Newfoundland established several transport routes for which aircraft could be ferried to Great Britain from manufacturing plants in different locations in the United States to Prestwick Field in Scotland. By thus following the great circle course, long one of the goals of airmen, the distance from southern California, where much of the U.S. aircraft industry was concentrated, to Iceland was reduced by almost , with no leg of the journey longer than . Nearly 900 aircraft were ferried through the North Atlantic bases to active combat theaters in 1942, approximately 3,200 in 1943, over 8,400 in 1944, and approximately 2,150 in the last five months of the European conflict in 1945; in all nearly 15,000 planes. Equally important, and indeed fundamental to the fulfilment of the ferrying mission itself, was the development of a safe, dependable service for strategic air transportation between the United States and the United Kingdom. =Postwar era= C-47 at Sondrestrom AB, Greenland In 1946,the Navy built a new and much larger weather station at Thule, Greenland. The Army Corps of Engineers built a airstrip on the south side of the station. In the following year the Thule airstrip was used as a jump-off point for exploration and a supply point for construction of airstrips and weather stations on the Canadian side of the straits (Eureka, Resolute, and Isachsen). The first Air Transport Command aircraft landed on 9 September 1946. The Strategic Air Command East Reconnaissance Group (Project Nanook) flew B-17 mapping and photography missions from Thule's primitive facilities. In February 1947 the airfield was used to recover the crew of the downed B-29 Kee Bird. The War Department decided that there was no longer a requirement for active defense of the areas of the North Atlantic bases. The Army began withdrawing personnel and equipment from the area, and on 1 September 1945, Greenland Base Command was consolidated with Newfoundland Base Command and became a subordinate organization of NBC. All United States Army and USAAF forces in Labrador and Northeast Canada were placed under the Newfoundland Base Command. Shortly afterwards, on 1 January 1946, Newfoundland Base Command was transferred from the Army Eastern Defense Command and was placed under the control of Air Transport Command. NBC's mission being to maintain key airfields used by ATC between the United States and Great Britain. ATC was inactivated and control of NBC was reassigned to the new Military Air Transport Service (MATS) on 1 June 1948. This arrangement continued until late 1950. =Northeast Air Command= 59th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-89D-45-NO Scorpion interceptors stationed at Goose AFB Strategic Air Command B-36 bomber refueling at Thule AB, Greenland 1st Rescue Squadron SB-17s Narsarsuaq Air Base, Greenland, about 1952 By 1948, the Cold War had erupted and a more urgent note was struck in the air defense of North America. The new Continental Air Command (ConAC), with headquarters at Mitchel Field, New York was established. Overall responsibility for air defense was vested in ConAC, and plans were made for a chain of Ground Control Intercept radar stations in Greenland and northeast Canada to detect any long-range Soviet aircraft approaching, with squadrons of interceptor aircraft to defend the airspace of North America. The Newfoundland Base Command was inactivated on 1 October 1950, and control of units and the former Newfoundland and Greenland Base Commands facilities was transferred to the Northeast Air Command (NEAC). Similar to the Military Air Transport Service, NEAC was a Unified Department of Defense Command, under the jurisdiction of the United States Northeast Command (USNEC). USNEC operated as a joint-service unified command under direct operational control of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. NEAC was the only component of USNEC. Neither the Army nor the Navy ever established component commands, however Army and Navy officers served on the staff of USNEC. Air Force officers served in dual positions on the staff of NEAC and on the staff of USNEC until USNEC was abolished on 1 September 1956. NEAC established its headquarters at Pepperrell AFB, Newfoundland and was given several additional units. In this form it had two primary missions, the former MATS mission supporting air transport and logistics, and a new role defending the defensive air bases of interceptors and radar stations being established in the region. NEAC's Area of Operations was defined as Newfoundland, Labrador, northeastern Canada, and Greenland. The operational units of NEAC were organized into the 64th Air Division (Defense). As a result of the Cold War the mission of NEAC was to provide RADAR cover over the northwest Atlantic Ocean, to provide a fighter interceptor force to defend against approaching enemy aircraft, and to support United States Army anti-aircraft defense forces. These units initially included F-94 Starfire squadrons at Goose AFB in Labrador, and Ernest Harmon AFB in Newfoundland, as well as a variety of Air Control Wings in the early warning role in Newfoundland, Labrador and Baffin Island. NEAC RADAR stations were part of the complex of stations built throughout Canada under the Canada-United States Radar Extension Plan (known as the Pinetree Line). In addition to the Pinetree stations located in Canada, three stations were built in Greenland. The Pinetree stations consisted of three direction centers and seven early warning stations. In Greenland, there were two early warning stations and a direction center. An air defense control center was built at Pepperrell AFB. In the late 1940s the United States studied the possibility of establishing a major operating base in Greenland when it became clear that round trip flights of planes carrying atomic bombs between US or Canadian bases and European objectives were impractical. The shortest route from the US to the Soviet Union's most important industrial areas was over the North Pole, and Thule is at the precise midpoint between Moscow and New York. Thule became a key point in the whole American military strategy. Strategic Air Command bombers flying over the Arctic presented less risk of early warning than using bases in England. Defensively, Thule could serve as a base for intercepting bomber attacks along the northeastern approaches to Canada and the US. Thule AB was constructed in secret under the code name Operation Blue Jay, with construction beginning in 1951. Construction took place around the clock. The workers lived on board the ship until quarters were built. It was built with a 10,000-foot (by 200') runway and a fuel storage capacity of about . On 1 July 1951, the 6622nd AB Squadron of NEAC arrived and air operations commenced on 11 September 1951. The first fighter interceptors assigned to Thule were four F-9ABs and began operations on 11 September 1952. This was Detachment 1 of the 59th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which went to Thule AB, Greenland with four F-94B's. Additional interceptor squadrons were established at Goose AFB in Labrador and Ernest Harmon AFB in Newfoundland and were composed of F-94s and F-89s. Also, there were numerous deployments of fighter-interceptor squadrons from the Tactical Air Command and Air Defense Command to NEAC bases, along with Strategic Air Command tankers and bombers, primarily using Thule as a refueling and staging base. Plans were made in 1952 to station anti-aircraft units at Thule for the protection of the base. The first Army anti-aircraft personnel arrived on 3 July 1953, with the main body of troops arriving on 27 August. The units deployed were the 549th AAA Gun Battalion (90mm), 428th AAA Battery (Light) (75mm), 429th AAA Battery (Light) (75mm), 177th AAA Operations Detachment, 357th Signal Radar Maintenance Unit, 128th Ordnance Artillery Repair Detachment, and 162nd Ordnance Integrated Fire Control Repair Detachment. =Inactivation= In mid-1956, the Joint Chiefs of Staff completed a worldwide reorganization plan, the Unified Command Plan. Its aim was a more efficient structure and reduced cost. It achieved this by consolidating organizations and eliminating excess superstructures. As part of this consolidation, United States Northeast Command (USNEC) was disestablished as a joint-service unified command, with control being assumed by the Air Force. The Army anti-aircraft group in the area, the 7th at Thule, was assigned to Army Anti-Aircraft Command. On 1 April 1957 the USAF discontinued NEAC. Air Defense Command and Strategic Air Command divided the Air Force units and equipment that had been under NEAC. ADC took over the USAF defense forces (including the 64th Air Division). ADC also took possession of Pepperrell AFB and all U.S. RADAR stations. SAC assumed ownership of Goose, Harmon, Thule, Narsarssuak, Sondrestrom, and Frobisher Bay Airport.

Inception In 1998, when the Delhi government launched the Bhagidari campaign, asking its citizens to participate in civic initiatives, the conservationist, Anita Ahuja and her IIT-alumna husband Shalabh rose to the challenge and launched Conserve. With a seed grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the duo began advocating waste management through seminars and workshops. Conserve started in the living room of some of Anita Ahuja's friends who were taking up issues like sewage and garbage. In synergy with the local Resident Welfare Associations (RWA), the Ahujas would also collect the waste of several colonies in a park and then segregate it. Wet kitchen waste would be converted into compost while dry refuse like polythene bags would be put aside. That project didn't quite work but led her to the idea of doing something about plastic bags. Over the next two years Ahuja experimented with recycling the bags. She tried weaving them together to create a tarpaulin-like covering for the shacks of slum dwellers. Another time she tried pasting pieces of the polyethylene onto canvas and cardboard. She saw that a thicker fabric could be used to make bric-a-brac like pen holders and file folders, and realized she'd finally found a successful recipe when her homemade products were popular at a fair at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi. She decided to venture into accessories. Ahuja‚Äôs project has created employment for scores of underprivileged people and also become a solution for solving the problem of plastic waste. The range has now been extended to creating footwear, cushions, jewellery, lamps, boxes and books. Recognition In August 2018 Power Brands awarded Anita Ahuja the Bharatiya Manavata Vikas Puraskar for her tireless efforts to protect our planet and all forms of life in it through her innovation ‚Äì ‚Äúhandmade recycled plastic‚Äù ‚Äì which will not only stall our hurtling march towards an ‚Äúenvironmental holocaust‚Äù, but also make plastics - a high end fashion material.

He was President of the Senate from 1974 to 1975, including for the duration of the 1975 constitutional crisis that resulted in the dismissal of the Whitlam Government. Early life O'Byrne was born in Launceston, Tasmania, and was educated at St Patrick's College. At the age of 18, during the Great Depression, he travelled to Queensland where he spent ten years working a variety of jobs including drover, fencer, bullock driver, tank sinker and station overseer. In 1940 he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force as a pilot, becoming a member of the No. 452 Squadron RAAF which operated with No. 11 Group RAF during the Battle of Britain. He was shot down over France in 1941 and was a prisoner of war in the Stalag Luft III prison camp in Germany for three years and nine months. Politics Following the war, O'Byrne stood for the Labor Party in Tasmania in the 1946 federal election, and was elected. O'Byrne's term as Senator began on 1 July 1947, and from that point, he remained in the Senate representing Tasmania until 30 June 1981. =President of the Senate= Following the double dissolution of 11 April 1974 and subsequent federal election, O'Byrne was elected President of the Senate on 9 July 1974. He held this office until the Dismissal of the Whitlam government on 11 November 1975. Senator Robert Ray said of O'Byrne's time as President of the Senate \\"Justin presided over the Senate during one of the most tumultuous and still controversial periods in Australian politics. The fact that there was not one dissent from his rulings, nor any vote of no confidence, is a testament to his performance and the high regard in which he was held by those on both sides of the chamber.\\" O'Byrne retired from the Senate at the 1980 election, his term ending on 30 June 1981. His term of 34 years is the longest by a Tasmanian in federal parliament, the third-longest Senate term after George Pearce and Walter Cooper, and the second-longest continuous Senate term after Pearce. From 1968 to 1971 he was a joint \\"Father of the Senate\\", and from 1971 until his retirement he alone held this title. Personal life On 26 January 1984, O'Byrne was made an Officer of the Order of Australia \\"for service to politics and government.\\" O'Byrne died on 10 November 1993, and a state funeral was held at the Church of the Apostles in Launceston. He was the last surviving member of the 1947-1950 Senate. He was the great-uncle of Michelle and David O'Byrne.

In November 2008 EMI Germany released a best-of-hardstyle, which includes four mixed CDs from the repertoire of Blutonium Records. In collaboration with EMI, a series of hardstyle compilations under the name Blutonium Presents Hardstyle was released in Germany and Australia.

The name officially refers to a mound spring located nearby. It is situated on the Oodnadatta Track adjacent to the Wabma Kadarbu Mound Springs Conservation Park, within the locality of Stuarts Creek about from Coober Pedy. Nomenclature and official status It was named in 1858 by Peter Warburton, the South Australian Commissioner of Police, after Corporal Thomas Coward. As of 2019, the name \\"Coward Springs\\" officially refers to a mound spring and not to a locality or a historical feature such as a town. History A government bore was completed on 16 July 1886. It was 400 feet deep and the artesian water rose 15 feet into the air from the bore. The salty water from the Great Artesian Basin had quickly corroded the bore head and bore casing and so by the 1920s millions of gallons of water flowed without control over the dry gibber plains, creating a wetland. A large pool formed where water bubbled from the corroded bore and was popular with railway passengers, crew, residents and locals alike. The bore was redrilled and relined in 1993 by the South Australian government and the flow rate was controlled and reduced. The current owners built the ‚Äònatural spa‚Äô to imitate the old pool. The water now flows from the rehabilitated bore through the ‚Äònatural spa‚Äô and into the wetland. The wetland has created its own dynamics and now is an oasis providing water and food, shelter and breeding areas for a wide range of wildlife. So far 99 plant species, 126 bird species and numerous small native mammals, reptiles, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates have been recorded here. Coward Springs had a school from 1888 to 1890 although it was probably better known for the Coward Springs Hotel that was licensed from 1887 to 1953. Historically, as the train pulled into the station, passengers were given directions to the 'pub' and the ‚Äòbath‚Äô (the latter is now well known as the ‚Äònatural spa‚Äô). When the hotel was demolished in 1965 the timber and galvanised iron were sent to a pastoral property on the Nullarbor Plain. Today The engine-drivers' cabin Coward Springs today is privately owned and operated as a campground and heritage area. The owner/managers successfully had the Coward Springs Railway Site listed in the South Australian Heritage Register on 13 August 1998. The heritage site consists of two railway houses (the Engine Drivers Cabin and the Stationmasters House), two in-ground rainwater tanks, the bore, date palms and athel pines. All listed heritage components have been restored. The Stationmasters House is a private residence, the Engine Drivers Cabin - a two-roomed cabin - was classified as a ruin in the 1980s but was restored by the current owners in the 1990s and opened as a museum. Although the present day date palms at Coward Springs reputedly were planted by pioneering \\"Afghan\\" cameleers, they are in fact remnants of two acres of date palms (variety Deglet Noor) planted there in 1898 as part of a South Australian government experimental plantation. Surviving date palms from this plantation (near the bore/'spa' and in the camping area) still produce fruit.

They are usually made of solid glass, about the thickness and slightly longer than a drinking straw, with rounded ends. Structure Stir rods are generally made of borosilicate (commonly known as Pyrex) glass or polypropylene plastic. They are usually between 10 and 40 centimeters in length and about half a centimeter in diameter. Glass rods are created from a single length of thin glass that is then cut into smaller segments. The ends are generally rounded (for example, by flame polishing) to prevent scratching the surface of glassware during use, which may lead to cracks if the glassware is later heated. Other shapes are possible, such as a flat paddle which can be used to circulate sediment, a triangular paddle to imitate a rubber policeman or a round button used to crush solids.http://www.scilabware.com/Stirrers/Stirring- Rods/Glass-with-button-and-paddle- ends/p-113-115-640/http://www.capitolscientific.com/Nalgene-6169-0010-Stirring- Rod-and-Rubber-Policeman-with-Flat-Triangular-Paddle-Ends-Polypropyl Uses A stirring rod is used for mixing liquids, or solids and liquids. Stir rods are used as part of proper laboratory technique when decanting supernatants because the contact helps to negate the adhesion between the side of the glassware and the supernatant that is responsible for the liquid running down the side. Using a stir rod also grants more control over the rate of flow, which is important in cases where chemicals may react violently. This process is also used to pour a large-mouthed flask or beaker into a test tube. Glass rods can also be used to induce crystallization in a recrystallization procedure, when they are used to scratch the inside surface of a test tube or beaker. They can also break up an emulsion during an extraction. Stir rod in beaker Applications in physics These are two classic experiments performed using glass rods. = Vanishing rods experiment = This experiment introduces students to the concept of an index of refraction in a liquid. Glass rods are placed in beakers of liquid, in this case oil and water. In water, the glass rods are visible because the refractive index of water is different for water and glass. In the oil, however, the glass rods seem to disappear because they have a refractive index very similar to that of glass, so the light doesn't bend as it crosses the glass/oil interface. = Electrification = Glass rods can also be used to demonstrate electrification by friction. This occurs when there are two surfaces rubbing together. In this instance, rubbing a glass rod with silk transfers negative charge from it. This effect is known as the triboelectric effect and can be performed with a variety of materials. Because glass rods and silk are relatively common, they are often chosen to demonstrate this effect.

At the age of 10, she achieved national fame in Sweden for winning the 2008 season of the talent show Talang, the Swedish version of British TV's Got Talent. Four years later, in 2012, Larsson signed with the record label TEN Music Group and subsequently released her debut compilation recording, the extended play Introducing, in January 2013. Larsson's first original song, \\"Uncover\\", topped the music charts in Scandinavia: Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. In February 2013, \\"Uncover\\" was certified Platinum by Universal Music Sweden. In July 2013, Introducing was certified 3√ó Platinum in the country. Larsson signed a three-year contract with Epic Records in the United States in April 2013. In 2016, she performed at the opening and closing ceremonies for UEFA Euro in France. Larsson's second studio album, So Good, was released on 17 March 2017 and entered at number seven on the UK Albums Chart. Her third studio album, Poster Girl, is expected to be released in 2020. Early life Zara Maria Larsson was born at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Stockholm County, Sweden, to Agnetha and Anders Larsson. In an interview with Svenska Dagbladet, she said that she was born \\"dead\\" due to a lack of oxygen from nuchal cord. Larsson grew up in Tallkrogen in Enskede, south of Stockholm. Her mother is a nurse and her father is an officer. She has a 3-year younger sister, Hanna, who is also a singer and a member of the band Lennix. Zara sang everywhere and often when she was young. Her first inspiration was Carola H√§ggkvist after getting her first album from her mother, which was a Carola album. She obsessively began impersonating Carola in every way, as best as she could. She then got amazed by Whitney Houston after receiving Whitney: The Greatest Hits. Zara has said that since the age of five she's known that she wants to become a legend and \\"immortal\\" like Elvis Presley. Larsson went to Gubb√§ngsskolan for primary school, but in her third grade transferred to the Royal Swedish Ballet School and studied until age 15. Afterwards she went to Kulturama, an art school in Stockholm. She described that the new environment quickly made her much more aware of the world, social issues, and gender patterns, which increasingly came to impress in her public role. In a 2015 interview, Larsson said that she was accepted into the Adolf Fredrik's Music School for junior high school, but declined because she did not want to sing in a choir.

Between December 2009 and January 2010, Zara participated in a reality TV series called Jag ska bli stj√§rna (English: \\"I shall become a star\\") where she and other young Swedish talents got help on the difficult road to international fame and success. She was managed by Laila Bagge, and they flew to Los Angeles in the United States where they visited and talked with Disney and the three big record label companies‚ÄîUniversal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group‚Äîbut she did not get a contract offer anywhere, which Zara later attributed to her age at that time. =2012‚Äì2014: Breakthrough with 1= Larsson singing on Sommarkrysset in 2013 Larsson signed with TEN Music Group in 2012 to record her debut compilation recording. The recording, the extended play (EP) Introducing, was leaked on 9 December 2012 through a music video of \\"Uncover\\" on YouTube.

In March 2020, Larsson was featured on Kygo's single, \\"Like It Is\\", alongside American rapper Tyga. The song has performed moderately well, becoming a top-five song in Sweden, New Zealand, and Norway. In May 2020 she announced through Twitter that she is on set for her album cover shoot. She also tweeted that she is shooting videos for two songs and the new album is coming. In June 2020, Larsson announced the single \\"Love Me Land\\" through Instagram. She released the song and music video on 10 July 2020. On the same day, an interview with her and Sveriges Radio was published. She announced that her new album will be released after summer 2020. She also said: \\"I am prepared in a completely different way. I have the next song ready, album cover, the video, the album is done. I just feel ready in a different way.\\" It was then revealed on her Spotify page that the album will be called Love Me Land and that the title track is now the first single from that album. However, Larsson later revealed in an interview that the album is titled Poster Girl and that \\"Wow\\" will also be included on the album, after officially announcing it as a single on 26 August 2020. In September 2020 Larsson released a remix of \\"Wow\\" featuring American singer, Sabrina Carpenter. Personal life, views and other work Larsson has grown increasingly vocal with her views on other artists and industry workers with whom she works and admires. While she has high praise for performers such as Beyonc√©, she is equal in her opposing views of such artists as Dr. Luke and Chris Brown. In January 2015, Larsson gained a lot of positive attention in Sweden and the United States after posting a picture on her Instagram showing a condom wrapped around her leg and foot in response to boys' concern that their penises were too big to fit a condom around it. She is currently fronting a new campaign from Durex and AIDS organization (RED) promoting sexual health awareness and raising money for AIDS treatment in South Africa. In June 2015 she came into the spotlight in her home country for openly questioning whether the Br√•valla Festival had any gender perspective whatsoever, as its promotion and performance line-up were highly dominated by male artists. She also wondered why she wasn't presented among the main acts despite being the most popular artist on Spotify of the festival's acts. That same day, Swedish artist G√ºnther wrote on his Facebook profile criticizing Larsson: \\"You are one of many teenybopper chicks who are world-famous in Sweden and maximally hyped but don‚Äôt come with any hits, only a lot of fuss.\\" During her performance at the festival she countered back saying: \\"Fuck G√ºnther, fuck all woman haters\\". This led to the hashtag #backazara being created and popularised on social media platforms, where thousands of people, including famous Swedish people, showed their support for Larsson. In order to increase public understanding of incontinence, she has openly stated that she used a diaper for seven years. In 2015, Larsson got to plan and host a summer speech to be broadcast on Sveriges Radio, as one of 58 celebrities that year. The 48-minute speech was broadcast live on the P1 channel on 25 July 2015, at 13:00 CET. Her age at the time, 17, made her the youngest such speaker to date, surpassing Robyn and Gina Dirawi at the age of 20. In the speech, she talked about her life, her music career, her feminist views, others' reactions to her, and her feelings about all of it. Between 2017 and 2019, she was dating British model Brian H. Whittaker, whom she tweeted in 2015, but did not meet until two years later. On 18 May 2017, Larsson released an H&M; collection containing various different garments and accessories. She was involved in the creation process by making decisions about press, colors and fitting. Pink is the common color throughout the entire collection. The artist with Clean Bandit decided to shoot the video of the hit \\"Symphony\\" showing the love story of a black homosexual couple, to contrast with the demonetization by YouTube of some channels on the platform themed LGBT. In October 2019, Larsson spoke out against Demi Lovato's pro-Israel stance on social media. Lovato commented on an Instagram post that she doesn't \\"have an opinion\\" and won't \\"choose a side\\" referring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Larsson subtweeted saying that if you \\"don't care\\", you're \\"a part of the oppressive side.\\" She later on added that it was not a post directed only to Lovato, but rather to \\"all the people who think their option to be disengaged in politics is anything but privilege\\".  Controversy  =Misandry claims= Larsson, a self-proclaimed fan of Beyonc√©, identifies as a feminist and models herself an \\"activist\\" after the singer. She attributes her openness of opinion on social media and within interviews to her parents, claiming: \\"Both my parents are very educated when it comes to social issues and being woke about what's going on in the world, and they've been very supportive of me having a voice\\". Larsson says she \\"has received a lot of hate\\" for her feminist opinions, including being called a \\"man hater\\". She accepts the label and has added that she \\"doesn't care\\", because \\"it doesn't really hurt men if I hate them\\". =Ties to Huawei= In March 2019, it was announced that Larsson had started a commercial cooperation with Chinese technology company Huawei. Larsson's cooperation with Huawei was criticised by experts on human rights in China and others, who referred to Huawei's close ties to the authoritarian Chinese government and its record on human rights among other things. In August 2020, Larrsson announced that she had ended her cooperation with Huawei. She said that China is \\"not a nice state\\" and that she does not stand behind its policies. In response, Huawei stated that that the endorsement deal was time- limited and had already ended in 2019. Larsson's music was reportedly taken down from Apple Music China after her views on the country were made public. Artistry Larsson cites Beyonc√© (pictured) as her biggest influence. Larsson is a pop singer. She has experimented with electropop, house, and dance music. Additionally, she is influenced by R&B.; Larsson has cited Beyonc√© as her biggest musical influence. Larsson's Swedish influences include Robyn, Seinabo Sey, Sabina Ddumba and her sister Hanna, with her neo soul group Lennixx. Additionally, her international influences include Rihanna, The Weeknd, Jay-Z, Ariana Grande, Jhen√© Aiko, and Lady Gaga.

It forms a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Saint Joseph College The campus is the original site of Saint Joseph's Academy, a Catholic school for girls from 1809 until 1973. The Saint Joseph College campus includes a variety of significant buildings including the Second Empire Burlando Building, St. Joseph's Chapel, and an early 19th-century brick barn. The chapel embraces a combination of the Italianate and Romanesque Revival styles. In June 1809, Elizabeth Ann Seton (later canonized as the first native-born U.S. saint) arrived in Emmitsburg, Maryland and established Saint Joseph's Academy and Free School, the first free parochial school for girls in the United States. This school laid the foundation for the Catholic parochial school system in the United States.Mother Seton School: A Rich History\\"National Shrine of Elizabeth Ann Seton\\", The Journey Through Hallowed Ground Mother Seton wrote classroom textbooks and trained her Catholic sisters to become teachers,EWTN: ST. ELIZABETH ANN SETON‚Äî1774-1821 and accepted all students regardless of ability to pay. Saint Joseph's Academy and Free School developed into Saint Joseph College High School (1890-1946), Saint Joseph's High School (1946-1982), and Saint Joseph College (1902-1973), a four-year liberal arts college for women.History of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church: Historical Highlights of Saint Joseph's Parish In 1973, Saint Joseph College closed its doors and ceased operations due to declining enrollment numbers and rising operating costs. Students and faculty were merged with Mount Saint Mary's University, formerly a liberal arts men's college located two miles (3 km) south of Emmitsburg on U.S. Highway 15. Even after the school closed, The Daughters of Charity have continued Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's legacy of helping educate children around the world. The college campus was purchased by the U.S. Government in 1979 for use as the National Fire Academy. It is home to the National Fire Academy, United States Fire Administration, National Emergency Training Center, and Emergency Management Institute (EMI), which is operated by the Directorate of Preparedness branch of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The campus also includes the learning resource center (LRC) library, the National Fire Data Center, and the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. Mother Seton's former tomb Mother Seton Shrine The second part of the historic district is part of the National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, which continues to be operated by the Daughters of Charity. The significant buildings here include the Stone House, which predates Mother Seton's arrival here, the White House, and Mother Seton's former tomb. The White House is the first building constructed after the founding of the college and occupied on February 20, 1810. It has subsequently been expanded. Mother Seton is now buried in the nearby basilica that bears her name, but she was previously buried in a brick Gothic Revival mausoleum in St. Joseph's cemetery. The Seton Shrine also includes the Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton and the adjacent St. Joseph's Provincial House, but they are outside of boundaries of the historic district.

It is about five miles (8 km) south west of Duns, about west of Berwick-upon-Tweed and about south east of Edinburgh. Situated in a gently undulating landscape, the estate is intersected by Blackadder Water, and its tributary burns. With the Lammermuir Hills to the north and views towards the Cheviot Hills in the south, this part of Berwickshire, sometimes referred to as the Merse, is very scenic and contains rich and fertile agricultural land.  History  The Palladian house was built by Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, in 1750. His bust, albeit a plaster copy, sits on a wall bracket in the saloon. The original is in Mellerstain House, another important Borders house which has intimate historical links with Marchmont. Before its completion the family lived in Redbraes Castle, the diminutive ruins of which can be seen in front of the present house by the steading. At Redbraes lived Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth, later Patrick Hume, 1st Earl of Marchmont. His portrait by William Aikman, c 1720, and framed by a George II period gilt mirror, hangs above the chimneypiece in the drawing room. It is not coincidence that a near identical portrait hangs in the Music Room at Mellerstain. Having been implicated in the Rye House Plot, Sir Patrick was forced into hiding in the vaults of Polwarth Church, close to the house. His daughter, Lady Grisell Hume, (later Grizel Baillie) smuggled food to him, and her well trod path from Redbraes to the church became known as ‚ÄòLady‚Äôs Walk‚Äô. Lady Grisell's life was an epic story of selfless bravery, for which she eventually found reward in a long and happy life. She wrote her memoirs which were handed down to her daughter, who in turn transcribed them for future generations. In them she tells of the fearful chapters she endured as a young teenager aiding her father and family. Sir Patrick fled to Holland in 1684, again assisted by his daughter, but made a glorious return with King William who reinstated their lands and created Sir Patrick the first Earl of Marchmont in 1697. He was later made Lord Chancellor, and then in 1698 he was elevated to \\"the highest official position in the kingdom, that of the King's High Commissioner to the Parliament\\"Marchmont and the Humes of Polwarth, by One of Their Descendants, 1894. The king's gratitude was symbolised by his granting Sir Patrick permission to place an orange, bearing the Imperial crown, in his coat of arms. An example of this can be seen clearly on the carved coat of arms on the east gable of Polwarth church restored by, and once a self-imposed prison of, Sir Patrick. The rear or west elevation showing the mix of 18th, 19th and early 20th Century architectural elements  The house, its interior, and development  The family's prosperity in the late 17th century, brought about by the reward of loyalty to the Crown, made it possible for grand ideas of Marchmont House to be conceived. Thoughts of creating an impressive new family seat inspired Alexander, the second Earl, to draw up designs for the landscaping. He also commissioned William AdamAdam, a prominent architect in his own right, was the father of a more famous architect son, Robert Adam. to draw up plans for the new house, however these were considered to be too expensive. Both the 2nd Earl and Adam died before the house was started. It was the 3rd Earl, succeeding in 1740, who became responsible for the execution of the new building. It is now understood that it was the lesser known architect Thomas GibsonKitty Cruft, John Dunbar and Richard Fawcett, ‚Äò'The Buildings of Scotland:Borders‚Äô' Pevsner Architectural Guides, . who designed the house and not Adam. However the latter's influence was certainly present in the architecture as well as garden design, as was that of the Palladian revival of Lord Burlington, a friend of the Earl of Marchmont. It has been commented that Marchmont's internal arrangement and elevations reflect those at Houghton Hall, Norfolk.Cruft, Dunbar and Fawcett It is also of interest that the second Earl's sister, Lady Grisell, married a Baillie from Mellerstain, where we know that William Adam worked. The interior is arguably one of the finest in Scotland. Only a trained eye, and one that knows of the architectural history, will notice a difference between the 18th and 20th century features at Marchmont. Much of the original George II period plasterwork, executed by Thomas Clayton, remains. Clayton was the best plasterer in Scotland of his time and worked for William Adam and others. He worked at many other important houses, including the Drum in Edinburgh, the Dukes Apartments at Holyroodhouse, at Hamilton Palace, the Duke's house in Lanarkshire, Blair Atholl, Perthshire and Arniston House. Thomas Clayton's plaster work on the ceiling in the Saloon Clayton's best work can still be seen at Marchmont. The Saloon was decorated between 1753-7 with military trophies on the ceiling and walls and family heraldry above door lintels detailing monograms of the 3rd Earl and his second wife. The Drawing Room is decorated with a scheme that celebrates the rich effect that the power of the sun and the phases of the moon have on nature. The central panel is surrounded by baskets of fruit, flowers and arable crops. This theme is echoed in the contemporary carved marble chimney piece decorated with the sun's rays seeming to emanate from the heat of the fire. Some alterations to the rear elevation of the house were made in 1834-42 by the architect William Burn. But major changes were made in the early 20th century. The last of the Hume family to live in the house was Sir John Hume Campbell. He sold it to Robert Finnie McEwen, father of Captain Sir John Helias Finnie McEwen, who inherited a considerable fortune from his uncles who had built the harbour at Rio de Janeiro. From 1914 -17 he commissioned Sir Robert Lorimer to make various alterations: a top floor was added and given dormer windows in a steeper pitched roof; the flanking pavilions were connected to the house internally; by lowering the ground at the front of the house the entrance was relocated on the ground floor with the addition of a porch, and the former entrance, now the central window of the first floor saloon, made redundant. Internally the main staircase was removed and successfully replaced by a two-storey open internal hall surmounted by an oval cupola, and a new grander staircase was located to the right of the entrance beneath a dome. The dining room and library were swapped so that the latter now overlooks the front of the house. A grand double storey music room, originally designed by Lorimer for Rowallan Castle, was made out of the stable wing in the north pavilion. It is finely panelled in oak with delicate carving modelled by Louis Deuchars and carved by W. and A. Clow.Cruft, Dunbar and Fawcett. At the east end of the room is placed a fine full size organ by Norman and Beard of Norwich, which is still maintained today. The grand music room, one of the focal points of the house, symbolises McEwen's love of music. We are reminded again of this love for music and that for country sports by 20th century plaster panels by Thomas Beattie decorating the second floor of the stairwell. An accomplished musician himself, McEwen set poems by Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott to music. The house was sold to Sue Ryder Care for use as a nursing home in the 1980s. It was recently sold to a private owner who has made extensive renovations both to the house and grounds. The music room has seen the organ fully restored and has been the location for public recitals. The top floor includes exquisite accommodation furnished with crafted wood furniture. One of the outbuildings has been converted for the use of furniture makers using the almost extinct craft of traditional wicker chair work. Murals have been added to the central space.Group tours are available on a very limited basis by arrangement.<2019 visit and tour> The avenue looking east, thought to be the longest in Scotland  The grounds and outbuildings  Thoughts of replacing the family seat of Redbraes Castle with a new and grand house started long before the foundations were laid. The planting of the Great Avenue was begun in 1726 when 10,000 Dutch elmsHistoric Scotland: Scottish Borders Council were ordered to line the avenue which at longMarchmont and the Humes of Polwarth, by One of Their Descendants, 1894. is thought to be the longest in Scotland. Still in existence (albeit with other trees, mostly beech, planted after the great gales of 1881) it leads north east from the front of the house and terminates at the Doocot, built in 1749 by James Williamson. There are about of designed landscape, more or less in the same format as originally laid out. The gardens were originally arranged formally and to the south and south west or rear of the house. The plans can be seen in the first edition OS map of 1857. A ha-ha separates the formal gardens from the deer park to allow a seamless view leading from the tightly arranged garden through into the wilder, but still man-ordered, policy of the deer park. Here there are many mature trees, some thought to date from the late 18th century. In 1962 the tallest oak in Britain was recorded at Marchmont. Specimen trees surround the gardens and include a fine cutleaf beech, an arbutus, a Wellingtonia, cedars and hollies. In the trees, behind the house to the north west, can be seen a pets‚Äô cemetery. Closer inspection shows a neatly laid out arrangement of 23 headstones bearing the names of fox hounds. Dating from 1866 carved with the name \\"Spot\\" to 1891 with \\"Little Boy\\", the stones relate to the Patrick Hume's three packs of hounds. In addition to the Doocot already mentioned, other interesting constructions are the steading built around a courtyard, which date to the 17th century; the yard clock dated 1746; the associated but later three-storey tower; the arched concrete span over garages, and the William Adam designed balustraded bridge of 1759, which connected the main entrance route from the north (named the Green Ride) to the approach to the house. The walled gardens laid out in the 18th century to the south of the house incorporate a magnificent greenhouse and associated structures built by Mackenzie and Moncur in 1915 after designs attributed to Lorimer. Berwickshire Railway The House had a private railway station on the North British Railway's Berwickshire Railway (opened 1863). The railway line ran from Reston to Earlston, joining the East Coast Main Line to the Waverley Line. Marchmont Estate Railway Station was closed to passenger traffic 10 September 1951. Freight continued until 19 July 1965. The station building still stands, currently a private house and the platform remains.

Pacciardi was again the commander at Huesca and Villanueva del Pardillo. In late of April 1937, it was dissolved to form the skeleton of the Garibaldi Brigade, formally established on May 1. Brigade was strengthened by the arrival of the soldiers of Dimitrov battalion and by the volunteers of the dissolved Italian column, and other Italian groups from other formations and many others new volunteers who continue to turn to Spain. The Garibaldi Brigade remained part of the XII International Brigade, under the direction of Randolfo Pacciardi until August 1937; it consisted of four battalions. Then there were five commanders until its dissolution on September 24, 1938. In addition to operations in the north of the current Community of Madrid and parts of Aragon, it played its most prominent role in the Battle of the Ebro. Mehmet Shehu, future Prime Minister of Albania, was among the volunteers. Other notable Albanian members include Veli Dedi, Petro Marko, Thimjo Gogozoto and Asim Vokshi, one of the staff officers of the battalion. Bibliography * Luigi Arbizzani, P.

The 1640 siege of Turin (22 May-20 September 1640) was a major action in two distinct wars: the Franco-Spanish War (1635‚Äì59) and the Piedmontese Civil War. When Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano and his Piedmontese faction captured Turin, the French garrison supporting the Regent Christine Marie of France retired within the citadel and continued to resist. A Franco-Piedmontese army led by Henri de Lorraine, count of Harcourt and Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne invested the forces under Prince Thomas within the city. Finally, a Spanish army under Diego Felipez de Guzm√°n, Marquis of Legan√©s appeared and encircled the French besiegers. In this triple siege, the Spanish army surrounded the French army which surrounded Prince Thomas' Piedmontese who surrounded the French controlled citadel. In the end the French prevailed; Prince Thomas surrendered on terms and was allowed to march his troops elsewhere, leaving Turin in French control. Turin is a major city in the northwest part of modern-day Italy. Background Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignan and his supporters had seized the city of Turin in 1639, but French troops supporting the Regent Christine Marie of France continued to hold the citadel. Under normal conditions in this period, it was not possible for a town to be held against a hostile citadel, but the anti-French forces managed to construct barricades that contained the French in the citadel, and spent the winter of 1639‚Äì40 under an uneasy truce. On 10 May, the French army under Henri de Lorraine, count of Harcourt and Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, supported by troops raised by Regent Christine, invested Turin, and thus started what became one of the most famous and complicated military events of the 17th century. The French army counted 6,000 foot soldiers and 3,500 cavalrymen. The French were supported by 3,500 Piedmontese. Siege After pushing in most of the defenders' outposts and building the usual lines of investment, the besiegers opened fire on 22 May. On 31 May a Spanish army under the governor of Milan, Diego Felipez de Guzm√°n, Marquis of Legan√©s, approached, but despite his numerical superiority dared not make a full-scale assault on Harcourt's lines, so he himself began to entrench around the French, starting a weeks-long conflict over individual posts but, despite constant pressure from Prince Thomas, only once risking an outright battle, in mid-July (14 July according to Saluzzo, 11 July according to Hanotaux and B√©renger), when he was thoroughly repulsed. The situation was particularly complicated in that Prince Thomas in Turin continued for weeks to hold some posts outside the city, ensuring some contact with the Spanish and a line of communication for supplies; the last such post fell to Harcourt late in July, and after this, food shortages began to hit the population and garrison - forage for horses ran out first, and Thomas twice attempted sorties, on 23 and 31 July, intended to enable his cavalry to escape, but failing both times. Harcourt was never completely cut off by Legan√©s from his lines of communication, and he was of course in contact with the citadel, but it is fair to agree with the traditional view that this had now become a four- layered siege: French troops still in the citadel were under attack by Thomas in the city, who was himself besieged by Harcourt and the French army, who was himself besieged by Legan√©s. It is sometimes suggested that Legan√©s tried to fire supplies over the French camp into the city, but this may be a legend, built on the fact that the Spanish did maintain written contact with Prince Thomas by messages placed inside cannonballs and fired over the French heads. Surrender Turin eventually had to consider surrender, and Prince Thomas, who had maintained on-off talks with the French and the Regent throughout the siege, opened negotiations with Harcourt, who made an agreement contrary to orders - if the French historian Hanotaux is to be believed, he was unaware of orders en route from Paris that he was to accept nothing from Thomas except pure surrender as a prisoner or agreement to enter French service; according to Saluzzo, Harcourt knew that Cardinal Richelieu's agent Mazarin was on his way with orders but wanted to avoid sharing the glory of a victory with anyone else so hastened to reach a settlement before Mazarin arrived. Whatever the cause, Harcourt agreed a cease-fire on 16 September and granted Thomas honourable terms in the capitulation signed on 20 September, and on 24 September Thomas marched out with his troops and withdrew to Ivrea.

The song has over the past three decades been re- released, remixed and covered a number of times, most notably by Whitney Houston in 1992 for the soundtrack album The Bodyguard, then featuring guest vocals by Khan herself and topping Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. A remix of Khan's original recording was also a Top Ten hit in the U.K. in 1989. The remix was included on the compilation Life is a Dance - The Remix Project, the title track of which was the second single release from the Chaka album in early 1979 (US R&B; #40). The album also features the ballad \\"Roll Me Through the Rushes\\", never commercially released as a single but still receiving considerable airplay in 1979, as well as Khan's cover version of Stevie Wonder's \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\", re-titled \\"I Was Made to Love Him\\".

It was based on a story by Milton Moorehttp://lonchaney.org/filmography/65.html. The film is now considered to be in the public domain and a lost film. Chaney played a dual role in this film, that of George Harding (the bank cashier) and the old peddler (Harding in disguise). He wrote to his brother George Chaney at the time how proud he was of this film (since he wrote it, directed it and played two parts in it using his extensive knowledge of makeup) and sent him some memorabilia from it. Plot An old peddler hides money in a hidden compartment in his chimney. His neighbor Mary Ellis is taking care of her invalid sister. Mary defends the old peddler from some boys throwing stones at him. Mary has been saving her money in a bank account, planning to raise enough cash to move to a better climate with her sickly sister. Charles Harding, a cashier at the bank, steals the bank's money, causing the bank to fail. When Mary hears the bank has no money, she pounds on the door in a vain attempt to get her cash out. The peddler sees Mary pounding on the bank door and he hurries home to retrieve the money that is hidden in his chimney. Mary appears at his house and he throws the money on the floor and tells her he robbed the bank. He rips off a fake beard and wig, and reveals to her that he is Charles, the cashier. Mary begs him to give the money back to the poor people. He gives her the money, but as she leaves, he runs after her as if to get it back. Suddenly he sees Mary hovering above him in a vision, and he stumbles back to his chimney and dies.

It is updated every five years and its latest 11th version of the system groups products into 45 classes (classes 1-34 include goods and classes 35-45 embrace services), and allows users seeking to trademark a good or service to choose from these classes as appropriate. Since the system is recognized in numerous countries, this makes applying for trademarks internationally a more streamlined process. The classification system is specified by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Origin of the Nice Classification The Nice Classification is based on a multilateral treaty administered by WIPO. This treaty, consummated on 15 June 1957 in Nice, France, is called the \\"Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks\\". This Classification is commonly referred to as the \\"Nice Classification\\". The Nice Agreement is open to states who are parties to the \\"Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property\\".

Advantages and uniqueness of the Nice Classification Use of the Nice Classification by national offices has the advantage that trademark applications are coordinated with reference to a single classification system. Filing is thereby greatly simplified, as the goods and services to which a given mark applies will be classified the same in all countries that have adopted the system. That the Nice Classification exists in several languages also saves applicants a considerable amount of work when filing internationally. Worldwide use As of January 2014, there were 84 signatory nations to the Nice Agreement; these countries have officially adopted the Nice Classification and apply it in the registration of trademarks. In addition, 65 non-member countries, four organizations and the International Bureau of WIPO also use the Nice Classification. The structure of the Nice Classification The Nice Classification consists of class headings, explanatory notes, and an alphabetical list of goods and services. The class headings are the official, descriptive names of the 34 categories or \\"classes\\" of goods and of the 11 classes of services. These are accompanied, where appropriate, by explanatory notes that provide detailed descriptions of the types of products or services included within the respective classes. The alphabetical list is an alphabetized enumeration of about 10,000 goods and about 1,000 services. Updating the treaty The Nice Classification is continuously revised by a \\"Committee of Experts\\", whose membership is representative of all signatory states, and a new edition is published every five years. The current (eleventh) edition has been in effect since 1 January 2017.

By contrast, many fungi (only ascomycetes and basidomycetes, as most other groups lack septa) contain septal pores ‚àí an unrelated phenomenon. Characteristics A sieve-like membrane may cover the pit in living algae, but in the majority of algae a plug forms, they likely limit the transfer of metabolites between neighbouring cells. Formation Primary pit connections are formed between cells in the same filament, derived from the same parent cell by its division. Such connections are always single, and usually circular; this is a result of their method of formation. The septum is formed as the walls of a filament grow inwards, dividing the cell; this results in a hole in the middle of the tube where the walls don't quite merge. Thus pit connections are visible in the youngest of septa, widening as the septum thickens, until in some cases they may ultimately occupy the entire septum. Secondary connections, by contrast, occur between unrelated cells, and serve a role in transferring cell contents and nutrients. They may even form between cells of different species, as in the parasite Holmsella.

The Court denied an application by the Attorney-General of Queensland seeking a certificate that would permit the Privy Council to hear an appeal from the High Court's decision in Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 1). Background Section 74 of the Constitution established the High Court as the final court of appeal for Australia, but included the compromise that the High Court could give leave for the Privy Council to hear appeals against High Court decisions, providing that: > No appeal shall be permitted to the Queen in Council from a decision of the > High Court upon any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits inter se > of the Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or > States, or as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of any two > or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is one > which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council. The High Court may > so certify if satisfied that for any special reason the certificate should > be granted, and thereupon an appeal shall lie to Her Majesty in Council on > the question without further leave. Except as provided in this section, this > Constitution shall not impair any right which the Queen may be pleased to > exercise by virtue of Her Royal prerogative to grant special leave of appeal > from the High Court to Her Majesty in Council. The Parliament may make laws > limiting the matters in which such leave may be asked, but proposed laws > containing any such limitation shall be reserved by the Governor-General for > Her Majesty's pleasure.section 74 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. This power was exercised only once, when a certificate to appeal was granted in Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth) In 1961 the High Court under Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon said: \\"experience shows ‚Äì and that experience was anticipated when s. 74 was enacted ‚Äì that it is only those who dwell under a Federal Constitution who can become adequately qualified to interpret and apply its provisions.\\" at p. 638. The Commonwealth Parliament was empowered to legislate to limit the appeals to the Privy Council and it did so in 1968Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 (Cth), which ended all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation and 1975.Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975 (Cth), which prohibited almost all types of appeal from the High Court. Decision In Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 1) the Court held by majority that s. 104(3) of the Navigation Amendment Act 1979 (Cth) validly repealed part of \\"the Imperial Act known as the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 ... in so far as that Act ... is part of the law of the Commonwealth\\". The Attorney-General of Queensland, who unsuccessfully intervened in Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No. 1) sought a certificate, under section 74 of the Constitution, to permit an appeal to the Privy Council. The High Court unanimously rejected the application, holding that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal, stating > \\"Although the jurisdiction to grant a certificate stands in the > Constitution, such limited purpose as it had has long since been spent. The > march of events and the legislative changes that have been effected ‚Äì to say > nothing of national sentiment ‚Äì have made the jurisdiction obsolete.\\" Significance This declaration by the Court and the provisions of the Australia Act 1986 by both the UK ParliamentAustralia Act 1986 (UK). and the Parliament of AustraliaAustralia Act 1986 (Cth) (with the request and consent of the Australian States) have for practical purposes ended all means of appeal from Australian courts to the Privy Council.

M.66-1997 A simpler, slightly later chasse showing scenes of Beckett's life. The Becket Casket is a reliquary in Limoges enamel now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is made of gilt-copper round a wooden core, decorated with champlev√© enamel, and of a shape called a \\"chasse\\". It was made in about 1180‚Äì90 in Limoges, France, and depicts one of the most infamous events in English history. On the night of 29 December 1170, Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in Canterbury cathedral by four knights obeying the wishes of King Henry II. It provoked outrage throughout Europe, and pilgrims flocked to Canterbury to pray at the site of the murder. In 1173 Becket was canonized and his shrine was one of the most famous in the Christian world, until its total destruction in 1538 during the reign of Henry VIII. It is thought that this particular casket was made to hold the relics of Thomas Becket that were taken to Peterborough Abbey (now Peterborough Cathedral) by Abbot Benedict in 1177. Benedict had been Prior at Canterbury Cathedral and therefore saw Becket's assassination. Relics of St Thomas were widely dispersed in the years following his death. Many were placed in caskets made in Limoges enamel in south-west France. This was the centre for the production of objects in champlev√© enamel, which is characterized by brilliant blues, colourful rosettes and boldly engraved figures. This casket is the most elaborate, the largest and possibly the earliest in date, but over 45 medieval chasses survive showing Becket's story and thought to have been made in Limoges. Another fine example is in the Burrell Collection in Glasgow.Binski, 225, with a catalogue entry on the Burrell chasse. The scene of the martyrdom is shown on the front, where one of the knights decapitates Becket in front of the altar, while on the sloping roof the archbishop's funeral is depicted. On the back are four saints and at the one end Christ is seated on a rainbow. The other end, which may have shown St Peter, is missing, as is the floor of the casket and its contents.

In the few years before Drowning on Dry Land was written, celebrity culture (propagated by a deluge of tabloid images and celebrity magazine gossip, and helped along by the emergence of reality TV shows such as Big Brother) rose to a point where people were becoming famous for no particular reason at all. As Dame Edna Everage once remarked: \\"celebrity is the new nonentity\\".Michael Billington's Afterword to his book The State of the Nation: British Theatre since 1945 (2007) London: Faber & Faber Ltd, The incident that led to the inspiration for the play was a moment in the 2003 Piers Morgan documentary The Importance of Being Famous where a young girl jumps up and down in a field for several minutes, then asks \\"Am I famous yet?\\"\\"On the Boardwalk of Fame\\", The Independent, 3 January 2005 This quote was originally intended as the title of the play. However, after looking through a dictionary of quotations, he came across an old English proverb, \\"It is folly to drown on dry land\\".Alan Ayckbourn, Preface to Plays 3 (Haunting Julia, Sugar Daddies and Private Fears in Public Places) (2004) London: Faber & Faber Ltd The title was changed accordingly, and a similar line was included towards the end of the play. By a fortunate coincidence (from the play's point of view), two tabloid stories were featuring in the celebrity news during the launch of the play: David Beckham's affair with Rebecca Loos and Leslie Grantham's antics in front of a webcam, thus helping to publicise the production. Official Ayckbourn website (play history) Several of Ayckbourn's observations about celebrity culture have obvious influences in the play. One notable quote was his opinion that a dangerous mistake celebrities can make is to believe all the good things said about them, both in publicity and what other people (particularly agents) say. He also suggested that in an age of increasing anonymity, some are increasingly desperate to be noticed.Venue, 28 January 2005 (as quoted on Ayckbourn site) The play also follows the theory that when one quickly rises to the top, one can fall just as quickly and mercilessly. Characters There are seven adult characters in the play. They are: * Charlie Conrad, celebrity * Linzi Ellison, Charlie's wife and former TV presenter * Jason Ratcliffe, Charlie's agent * Hugo de Pr√©scourt, Charlie's big-shot solicitor * Gale Gilchrist, rising television journalist * Marsha Bates, also known as \\"Mr Chortles\\", entertainer for children's birthday party * Simeon Diggs, Marsha Bates' solicitor Charlie Conrad is the central character, although Linzi, Jason, Gale and Marsha all have significant roles. Hugo and Simeon appear in a single scene. In addition, there are also two cameo parts of Laura and Kate, two children at the party. Setting The play is set over three scenes, one long scene covering the whole of the first act, and two shorter scenes in the second act. The three scenes occur over a period of about ten weeks towards the end of Charlie's celebrity career and his sudden descent into obscurity. Until the last moment of the performance, the location for all three scenes is a Victorian architectural folly (obvious suggestions of symbolic value acknowledged) in the grounds of Charlie Conrad's vast Home Counties mansion. In the closing moments of the play the set also represents the roof of the same folly. The original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre was staged in-the-round. Synopsis The play opens with Linzi telling Marsha what she wants for her small son's birthday party, but she also drops hints that all is not well between her and her husband Charlie. Linzi is frustrated that he will miss his son's birthday party while giving a celebrity interview. But at a deeper level she wants her own fame back as a TV presenter; she stopped when she had children, but got stuck afterwards as a celebrity wife. When Charlie arrives they quarrel, escalating to abuse, but the moment the journalist, Gale, appears they embrace as a happy celebrity couple. Gale is notorious for her attacks on celebrities, but Charlie's agent, Jason, insists the interview will keep her on-side. Before the interview begins, Gale explores the folly, going through one doorway and emerging from the other, back where she started, thanks to an optical illusion that fools one into thinking one is ascending to a higher level. Jason sits in, attempting to control the interview, both he and Gale with tape recorders; but Gale steers the conversation around to how Charlie became famous. In reality, he first grabbed attention as an inept, injured sportsman being carried away from a Marathon, applauded by the crowd. Appearing on a game show he gained public sympathy by getting all the questions wrong. But invited back he eventually became celebrity host of the show. Charlie is happy to be considered useless at everything, but Gale suggests he is failing on purpose. Jason leaves while Charlie and Gale continue to talk. He gets the impression that Gale is making a pass and she reacts accordingly. At her invitation they both enter the doorways into the folly to meet in the middle. Charlie does so enthusiastically, but Gale sneaks off. Charlie instead meets Marsha, now fully dressed as the clown, \\"Mr. Chortles\\". Marsha, who holds Charlie in awe (proof to her that anyone can be famous), asks him to autograph her thigh. Suddenly, as Charlie is removing Marsha's bloomers, two little girls from the party enter with Linzi, closely followed by Gale and Jason. The spell broken, Marsha runs into the folly, leaving Charlie with her bloomers in his hands. Then, emerging from the other door, she sees everyone, turns and runs back in. Act Two: two weeks later, Charlie's celebrity career is taking a hammering from the incident widely reported by Gale. As some consolation, Gale's own career is also in trouble when her lesbian partner (well-known to all but Charlie) is caught dealing drugs. He meets his solicitor, Hugo, to arrange a settlement with Marsha, pressing charges for sexual intimidation and indecent assault. Marsha arrives with Simeon, her own solicitor. Hugo starts by asking Marsha and Simeon to establish the facts of the case, but when Marsha confirms she was dressed as a clown, Hugo suggests Charlie wouldn't have known she was a woman, and turns the meeting into a belittling interrogation, a mini-courtroom drama. Marsha rips open her blouse and shouts \\"I am a woman!\\" as Simeon drags her away. Before leaving in his helicopter, Hugo promises a favourable out-of-court settlement and, as an afterthought, mentions that Linzi is starting divorce proceedings. Linzi appears, more civil than last time, confirms this, and says she is now looking to restart her own career. In the closing scene, two months later, although Hugo has kept the case out of court, Charlie's fame has collapsed to insignificance ‚Äî not even a mention in the \\"Where are they now?\\" columns. Looking for the last time at the house and grounds he has sold, he meets Jason, who gives him the news that (boosted by media attention from the thigh-signing scandal) Marsha is doing well as Mr. Chortles. Jason also tells Charlie that he is retiring and thinking of selling his memoirs ‚Äî mentioning that obviously Charlie will be part of the story. Gale arrives, now \\"freelance\\" ‚Äî her optimistic description of her own collapsed career. She wants to photograph Charlie sitting with a clown costume strewn around him, which she thinks could be her next big break ‚Äî a view not shared by Charlie. With this done Charlie meets a happier Linzi, looking very different from the Linzi at the start of the play. Out of Charlie's spotlight, she is now a children's show presenter with Marsha as next week's guest. She amicably urges Charlie not to believe the good things written about him, for \\"you can drown, even on dry land.\\" Left alone, Charlie accidentally scares away a couple of young girls. He enters the folly, as lighting and sound change to represent a new location. Emerging from the passage he discovers that at long last he has reached the top. Gazing at the view he shouts triumphantly: \\"I did it!\\" Productions The play was first performed at the Stephen Joseph Theatre on 29 April 2004 with an opening night on 4 May 2004.Performance dates at Stephen Joseph Theatre on official Ayckbourn site The cast were:Production details on official Ayckbourn site * Charlie Conrad ‚Äì Stephen Beckett * Linzi Ellison ‚Äì Melanie Gutteridge * Jason Ratcliffe ‚Äì Adrian McLoughlin * Hugo de Pr√©scourt ‚Äì Stuart Fox * Gale Gilchrist ‚Äì Billie-Claire Wright * Marsha Bates ‚Äì Sarah Moyle * Simeon Diggs ‚Äì Paul Kemp Most notable in this line-up was Stephen Beckett in the lead role. Having previously played significant roles in The Bill and Coronation Street, he had his own experience of celebrity-driven media attention to draw on, thereby causing some speculation that the character was based on him. Although he was not drawn in specially for his role (he had appeared in Stephen Joseph Theatre productions before), Alan Ayckbourn reportedly said there was an instinct of Charlie that was like him.Worcester News, 18 February 2005 Billie-Claire Wright was the first black actor to appear in an original production of an Ayckbourn play, although the part of Gale was not expressly written for a black actress. (The first parts written specifically as black characters were Winnie and Laverne in My Wonderful Day, played by Ayesha Antoine and Petra Letang.) The production team were: * Director ‚Äì Alan Ayckbourn * Designer ‚Äì Roger Glossop * Lighting Designer ‚Äì Mick Hughes * Costume Designer ‚Äì Christine Wall * Original Music ‚Äì David Newton The production subsequently toured. London was not included in the tour, partly due to the West End's treatment of Damsels in Distress two years previously. However, performances were made in other south-east venues close to London. Alexandra Mathie replaced Billie Claire-Wright as Imogen in the tour. Six of the seven adult actors (Stuart Fox being the exception) also appeared in Private Fears in Public Places ‚Äî a play inspired during the rehearsals for Drowning on Dry Land ‚Äî during the run at the Stephen Joseph Theatre.Production details of Private Fears in Public Places on official Ayckbourn site In 2008, Drowning on Dry Land was revived by the Salisbury playhouse.Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 18 August 2008 Critical reviews Drowning on Dry Land drew a fair amount of attention owing to the stories dominating the press at the time of production. Comparisons were made to David and Victoria Beckham, and the reviews were near-unanimous in praise of Hugo's savaging of Marsha.Reviews on official Ayckbourn site The critics were generally sympathetic to Charlie Conrad. Ian Shuttleworth for the Financial Times wrote: \\"Charlie's gift is to be \\"useless at everything\\" in a kind of apotheosis of ordinariness. He is also a typical Ayckbourn innocent: caught up in the machinery but fundamentally good-hearted and too trusting\\".Ian Shuttleworth, Financial Times, 5 May 2004 However, the reception was, on the whole, lukewarm compared to some earlier works. For The Independent, Lynne Walker wrote: \\"Our most prolific and popular playwright seems to have forgotten that the twists and turns in a storyline do need to be plausible rather than just the vehicle for a sequence of ideas, no matter how cunning they are in themselves\\",Lynne Walker, The Independent, 13 May 2004 while Sam Marlowe for The Times concluded: \\"Drowning on Dry Land is like its hapless anti-hero: there's not much more to it than meets the eye\\".Sam Marlowe, The Times, 6 May 2004 By the end of 2005, the reception of the play had been dwarfed by the other Ayckbourn play of the season, Private Fears in Public Places, which had enjoyed glowing reviews during its New York run.

Military career Balck in uniform. Balck was born in Karlskrona, Sweden, and was a sailor in his youth. In 1861, he joined the Swedish War Academy at Karlberg in Stockholm as an officer cadet of the Swedish Navy. After a while, he switched track to become a cadet for the Swedish Army, and was active in fencing and gymnastics. He stayed on as assistant gymnastics instructor at Karlberg for a while, and in 1866 was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the N√§rke Regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1875, in the same regiment, and to captain in 1884.Nordisk familjebok, band 2 (1904), sp. 754-755: Balck, Viktor Gustaf However, Balck's military career came to be devoted almost entirely to gymnastics and sports. He was assistant instructor at Karlberg from 1868 to 1870, then gymnastics teacher at the Swedish Army Riding and Horse-Driving School at Str√∂msholm, 1870-1872. He became an instructor of military gymnastics and fencing at the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute in 1885, was chief instructor in the same subject, 1887-1909, and the Institute's director 1907-1909.Nordisk familjebok, supplementband 34 (1922), sp. 433: Balck, Viktor Gustaf He was promoted to major in the Swedish Army in 1894, to lieutenant colonel in 1900, and to colonel in 1904. In 1909 he transferred to the reserve list and in 1914 received an honorary promotion to major general. Career as sports leader Directly after completing his officer's training, Black studied the pedagogical, military and medical course at the Swedish Central Institute of Gymnastics 1866-1868, and stayed on as assistant teacher at the Institute 1868-1870, while also being an assistant teacher at Karlberg. From 1872, his main activities - both in military and civilian gymnastics and sports - had the Institute as a base. As a young officer and gymnastics teacher, Balck was of the impression that voluntary gymnastics and sports activities in Sweden, i.e., outside the army and the schools, were undeveloped in comparison to the contemporary situation in many other countries. Determined to change this, from the 1870s he participated in the formation of several sporting clubs and organisations, and the founding of several related journals. During this time, Swedish organised sports took shape, and Balck became one of its leading figures. International sports career As one of the original members of International Olympic Committee Balck also became involved in the emerging international sports movement at the end of the 19th century. In 1894 he became one of the original members of International Olympic Committee (IOC), and was one of two vice presidents of the Swedish Olympic Committee from 1913 to his death in 1928. He was also one of the leading figures behind the Nordic Games which were arranged from 1901. Already in 1894 in IOC, Balck had proposed Stockholm as a venue for the Olympic Games. The official application to arrange the games came in 1908, and despite strong competition from Berlin, Stockholm were chosen to host the 1912 Summer Olympics with Balck a prominent member of the national organising committee. He was also a president of the International Skating Union from 1894 and 1924. His ice skating career also included the construction of the \\"Balck skate\\". In recognition of his international sports career, Balck was appointed as an honorary Knight Commander of the British Order of St Michael and St George, so in Britain he was styled as \\"Viktor Balck, KCMG\\". Awards and decorations Balck's awards: *Commander First Class of the Order of Vasa *Knight of the Order of Vasa *Commander of the Order of the Black Star with star *Knight Second Class of the Order of the Crown with star *Knight Second Class of the Order of Saint Stanislaus with star *Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) *Commander of the Order of the Redeemer *Knight Second Class of the Order of the Red Eagle *Officer of the Legion of Honour *Knight of the Order of Leopold *Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog *Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy *Knight of the Order of St. Olav *Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword *Officier d'Acad√©mie References  External links  *International Skating Union ‚Äì Past Presidents at www.isu.org Category:1844 births Category:1928 deaths Category:International Olympic Committee members Category:Swedish sports executives and administrators Category:Swedish Army major generals Category:Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:People from Karlskrona Category:International Skating Union presidents Category:Commanders First Class of the Order of Vasa Category:Knights of the Order of Vasa Category:Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences alumni ","title":"Viktor Balck"},{"id":"18109996","text":"Commerce Bancorp was a Cherry Hill, New Jersey‚Äìbased bank created in 1973. In 2007, it was purchased by Toronto-Dominion Bank, which merged Commerce with TD Banknorth to form TD Bank, N.A.; all of its banks and branches were given the TD Bank logo. History The company was founded in 1973 by fast-food restaurant franchise owner Vernon Hill, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Hill sought to bring fast food convenience to banking and expanded Commerce from one location to over 435 in thirty-three years. With growth of over sixty-five new stores opening annually, the company had planned to reach at least 800 stores by 2010. During the early-mid 2000s, television advertisements for Commerce Bank featured Kelly Ripa and Regis Philbin. In 2006, Commerce purchased eMoney Advisor for $32 million in stock. In 2004, two Commerce executives were sentenced to more than two years in prison after being convicted of approving loans to Philadelphia‚Äôs treasurer (who was sentenced to ten years in prison) and others in order to get the inside track on city banking business. The federal Office of the Comptroller of Currency and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs investigation of insider dealing at Commerce (unrelated to the Philadelphia case) led to a settlement with the bank (no charges were filed) that included restrictions on the bank‚Äôs expansion. Hill then retired as chairman, president and chief executive officer. Hill sued Commerce in 2008, saying he was fired without cause and was owed more than $57 million in severance and damages. In 2013, a federal court ruled that Commerce could not legally pay Hill because the bank had refused to ‚Äúto certify it had no reason to believe Hill had committed fraud, breached his fiduciary duty or abused his insider privileges.‚Äù Business model Commerce's philosophy was that they were retailers, not bankers, and went so far as to call their various locations stores, not branches. Features that Commerce offered its customers included: *\\"America's most convenient bank\\" *Seven-day lobby or drive-thru hours, even in Center City Philadelphia and Manhattan, with the exception of branches in Paramus, New Jersey (Bergen County law requires most businesses to be closed on Sunday) *Instant creation of ATM cards on the spot at the time of account opening *No overdraft fees on debit card usage *Free \\"penny arcade\\" coin counting machines for both customers and non-customers *No-fee Visa gift cards for customers *Lollipops and dog biscuits in the lobby and drive-thru *Foreign ATM fee reimbursement (if you maintain a daily balance of $2,500 through the statement cycle) *\\"No Stupid Fees, No Stupid Hours\\" Commerce Bank's business model generated what some called a cult following in the areas where they had stores. Commerce offered its customers merchandising giveaways such as coffee mugs, pens and pencils; in 2006 alone, the locations gave out 28 million free pens. It was called Mc-Bank because Vernon Hill used his knowledge of the fast food chains he owned and applied it to the banking industry. This model was described in the case study HBS 9-603-080 from Harvard Business School, published in 2002. Commerce had high expenses, leading to less profit than its competitors: In 2004, ‚Äústratospheric‚Äù capital expenditures resulted in a net income per employee of $25,000, compared to $135,000 per employee for another fast- growing bank in the same region. Operating profit margin declined to 16 percent in 2006 from 26 percent in 2004. An example of such high costs: To enter New York City‚Äôs Chinatown market, the company likely spent $306,790 on gifts of rice cookers for fourteen thousand new accounts opened for as little as $250. Commerce had the lowest deposit rates in each of the local markets it served. But Commerce choosing to be ‚Äúworst in class on some service dimensions,‚Äù including ‚Äúdismal deposit rates,‚Äù generated additional capital for funding extended business hours and in-depth customer service, and free checking accounts ‚Äúin exchange for little or no interest.‚Äù Commerce‚Äôs Penny Arcade coin-counting deposit machines could be used without charge even by noncustomers, and raised funds for medical research and hurricane relief. Later, some were retired by successor TD Bank in 2016 ‚Äúin the wake of lawsuits claiming that the machines were short-changing customers. Mascots Commerce Bank had an official mascot, Mr. C, whose costume was the Commerce Bank logo, a red letter \\"C\\", with black arms and black legs. He always had a huge smile and large bushy eyebrows. Mr. C. was retired as a result of the TD acquisition. Expansion While most of Commerce Bank's growth was organic, there were five large acquisitions: *early 1990s - Four branch offices were purchased from Long Island-based Anchor Savings Bank: Cherry Hill Mall, Bellmawr, Woodcrest and West Deptford. *January 21, 1997 - Independence Bancorp, Inc. became Commerce Bank/North. *August 13, 1998 - Community First Banking Company and its subsidiary Tinton Falls State Bank became Commerce Bank/Shore. *September 17, 1998 - Prestige Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Prestige State Bank became Commerce Bank/Central *July 25, 2005 - Palm Beach County Bank established Commerce Bank in Southeast Florida. Controversies Loans to its own executives and directors totaled $145.7 million in 2003. Commerce said these loans were appropriate because they were made in the ordinary course of business and on ordinary terms. Commerce also contracted with entities controlled by Vernon Hill and his family for interior design (InterArch, owned by Vernon Hill‚Äôs spouse) and real estate (Vernon Hill was a personal investor in Commerce‚Äôs rent-generating properties; and his son earned brokerage commissions when his private firm found properties for new Commerce branch locations; and Commerce paid for employees‚Äô use of Galloway National Golf Club, owned by Vernon Hill). Commerce Bank Harrisburg Commerce Bank had an independent franchise in the Central Pennsylvania region called Pennsylvania Commerce Bancorp, Inc, locally known as Commerce Bank Harrisburg. Commerce Bank shared a call center with Commerce Bank Harrisburg and owned approximately 11% of its stock. When Commerce Bank was acquired by TD Bank in 2007, Commerce Bank Harrisburg was not included in the sale. In November 2008, Commerce Bank Harrisburg announced plans to acquire Republic First Bank of Philadelphia in a tax-free all-stock transaction and would be known as Metro Bank as the result of a merger. That following August, Commerce Bank Harrisburg extended its deadline to acquire Republic First after it was unable to gain timely regulatory approval. But in March 2010 both boards of directors voted to terminate their merger agreement due to uncertain that the merger application would receive regulatory approval. In June 2009, Commerce Bank Harrisburg announced it was going ahead with rebrand to Metro Bank (Metro Bancorp Inc), because its license to use the Commerce Bank brand and red ‚ÄúC‚Äù logo, granted by Commerce Bank was expiring. On February 12, 2016, Metro Bank ceased to exist after its US$474 million merger with First National Bank was completed. Metro Bank had 33 branches in Berks, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, and York counties.http://www.commercepc.com/locations_hours/all_counties.cfm It was headquartered in Swatara Township, just outside Harrisburg. \\"Commerce Bank\\" brand A former Commerce Bank in Tuckerton, New Jersey, that was rebranded as TD Bank in 2009. Almost every Commerce Bank branch was built in this style, and is recognizable even after the merger. Several banks in the United States have traded under the name \\"Commerce Bank\\" or similar names, leading to brand confusion. As a result, Commerce Bank and Trust Company in Worcester, Massachusetts successfully sued TD Bank to stop it from using the name \\"TD Commerce Bank\\", which it had planned to trade under following its acquisition of Commerce Bancorp. However, Commerce Bancshares, in Kansas City, Missouri, and Commerce National Bank, in Columbus, Ohio both still exist and do business under their respective names, even though they are unaffiliated with the now- defunct Commerce Bancorp. TD Bank acquisition The TD Bank logo On October 2, 2007, TD Bank Financial Group (TDBFG) and Commerce Bancorp, Inc. announced that they had signed a definitive deal agreement for TDBFG to acquire Commerce Bank in a 75% stock and 25% cash transaction valued at US$8.5 billion. Under the agreement, Commerce shareholders received 0.4142 shares of a TD common share and US$10.50 in cash in exchange for each common share of Commerce Bancorp Inc. The consideration was negotiated on the basis of US$42.00 per share value for Commerce Bank. The transaction value based on the October 1, 2007 closing price of TD common shares is $42.37. After TD acquired Commerce, Vernon Hill left Commerce and joined Republic Bank, recreating Republic Bank as a 'retail store' bank.

Geography  The Northern Black Forest is bounded in the north by a line from Karlsruhe to Pforzheim and, in the south, by a line running from the Rench valley to Freudenstadt. Its northern boundary largely coincides with the emergence of the extensively forested bunter sandstone strata from the arable region of the Kraichgau; its southern boundary with the Central Black Forest (or, in the case of a bipartite division, the Southern Black Forest) varies depending on the definition or natural regional division used (see also Black Forest). Earlier, the Northern Black Forest was the entire northern half of the mountain range as far as the line of the Kinzig valley, which divides the Black Forest east of Lahr. To the west it is bounded by the Upper Rhine Plain, to the east by the G√§u landscapes. The Northern Black Forest is not the same as the spatial-planning region of Northern Black Forest, which covers the eastern area.  Landscape and geology  With its rather angular ‚Äì in places trapezoidally-shaped ‚Äì summits, the Northern Black Forest rises above the Rhine Plain by more than . By contrast, its eastern slopes descend gradually and there is less of a height difference with its neighbouring regions. Its highest peak is the Hornisgrinde at . Woods cover on average 73% of the whole land area and make the Northern Black Forest the most cohesive forested part of the Black Forest, but there are also extensive areas of so-called \\"Grinden\\": treeless, wet heaths, on its highland slopes. Geologically, the dominant rock of the Northern Black Forest is bunter sandstone, although in the deeply incised west its gneiss bedrock reaches the surface. Granites (e.g. Forbach granite) and porphyries have intruded forming crags and tors. The highland regions of the Northern Black Forest are among the regions of the German Central Uplands with the heaviest rainfall (up to 2,200 mm per annum). Its most important rivers are the Murg, Nagold, Enz, Alb, Acher, Rench, Oos and the upper reaches of the Wolf. In 2001, the Central and Northern Black Forest Nature Park (Naturpark Schwarzwald Mitte/Nord) was established and its coverage includes the whole of the Northern Black Forest. In addition, an area of about 10,000 hectares has been designated since 1 January 2014 as the Black Forest National Park. It has numerous highly popular tourist attractions as well as winter sport areas in addition to the towns named below and the Black Forest High Road and Kaltenbronn.

Other tarns are the Ellbachsee, Herrenwieser See, Huzenbacher See, Sankenbachsee, Schurmsee and the Wildsee near Ruhestein. Many of them were also impounded in order to supply excess water for timber rafting which was common until the 19th century. Other former tarns have silted up. The Hohlohsee and the Wildsee near Gernsbach-Kaltenbronn are raised bog lakes on the highlands between the Murg and Enz valleys that are only fed by local precipitation. There are several dams in the Northern Black Forest. The Schwarzenbach Dam and the Murg Dam are part of the Rudolf-Fettweis-Werk, a pumped storage and run-of-the-river power station in Forbach. The Nagold Dam regulates the water level of the Nagold. The Kleine Kinzig Dam is used for drinking water, water regulation and electricity generation.

A very metal-poor star, it is surrounded by a thick unique circumbinary disk enriched in several molecules. With an apparent magnitude of about 5.5, the star can readily be seen under ideal conditions. It is located approximately distant. HR 4049 has a peculiar spectrum. The star appears, based on its spectrum in the Balmer series, to be a blue supergiant, although in reality it is an old low-mass star on the post-AGB phase of its life. Its atmosphere is extremely deficient in heavy elements, over with a metallicity over 30,000 lower than the Sun. It also shows a strong infrared excess, corresponding closely to a blackbody produced by a disk of material surrounding the star. The star is also undergoing intense mass-loss HR 4049 has an unseen companion, detected from variations in the doppler shift of its spectral lines. The properties of the companion can only be estimated by making certain assumptions about the inclination of the orbit and the mass function. Given those assumptions, it is thought to be a low luminosity main sequence star. HR 4049 is an unusual variable star, ranging between magnitudes 5.29 and 5.83 with a period of 429 days. It has been given the variable star designation AG Antliae, but is still more commonly referred to as HR 4049. It has been described as pulsating in a similar fashion to an RV Tauri variable, although the preferred interpretation is that the variations are produced by variable extinction produced by the material around the star and that the period is the same as the orbital period. Although HR 4049 apparently has the spectrum of a blue supergiant, it is an old low-mass star which has exhausted nuclear fusion and is losing its outer layers as it transitions towards a white dwarf and possibly a planetary nebula. During this phase it has a luminosity several thousand times that of the Sun, although a mass around half that of the sun. The mass can only be guessed from the expected mass of the white dwarf that it is becoming.

It includes Maulden Wood and Pennyfather's Hill, a 148.8 hectare, biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Overview Maulden Wood is classed as a semi-natural broadleaf woodland, on acidic grassland and includes some conifer plantations. Paths through the lead can be reached from Maulden Church, through Church Field, and from the A6 road layby through the wood. There are grasslands in the centre of the wood. They are managed by the Greensand Trust and the Forestry Commission. Scientific interest Much of Maulden Wood is designated as an (SSSI) for the acidic grassland and heathland interest, and wildlife includes badger sets, foxes, and barn owls. The site is important for invertebrates and plants which are indicative of the varied clay and sandy gravel soil. One notable invertebrate is limax cinereoniger, a mollusc that is also indicative of unmanaged ancient woodlands. The rare Wild Service Tree Sorbus torminalis also grows in the drier places deep in the wood. The greensand ridge, at the woodland edge. The northern end of the wood is also an SSSI because of its importance as one of Bedfordshire's largest remnants of ancient woodland in addition to the nearby King's Wood. Maulden wood is green most of the year round due to the large percentage of pine and other evergreen trees. Hedgerows around the perimeter contain bindweed, sticky willy, honeysuckle, and trumpet flowers (Bindweed). Snowdrops and cowslips grow prolifically in the early spring. In the mid to late spring, bluebells can be found in the middle of the wood and on the waysides. The southern end of the wood is sometimes called Pennyfather's wood. It is situated on greensand, whereas the rest of Maulden Wood is situated on a cap of glacial boulder clay. There also some rare species of sawfly (Symphyta, Pamphilius sylvorum and Caliroa cinxia, which feed on the resident oak (Quercus) trees. Another sawfly, Pamphilius gyllenhali, has been recorded in the wood, which feeds on willow Salix alba. There are also notable species from several major invertebrate groups including the beetles, dragonflies and butterflies. History The north of Maulden Wood includes several Roman and Iron Age archaeological sites along Limbersey Lane and on the site of Limbersey Farm. There are also sites within the wood of medieval origin, especially on the north end of the wood, and on the west (Maulden) end of the wood. The north end of the lay by on the A6 is the site of the 1961 A6 murder. Access Maulden Wood is open to the public all year round.

In North America it is the only example of historic Chinese vernacular architecture. As such it provides an example of the type of dwelling an average family in China would have lived in. The Yin Yu Tang (Hall of Plentiful Shelter) was built in the late eighteenth century during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). A prosperous merchant surnamed Huang built a stately sixteen-bedroom house in China's southeastern Huizhou region, calling his home Yin Yu Tang House. This Chinese merchant commissioned the construction of the house in the province of his birth, Anhui, China. The five-bay, two-story residence was typical of its region, built of timber frame construction, with a tile roof and exterior masonry walls of sandstone and brick. The house is about 47 feet 6 inches by 52 feet 5-1/2 inches not including the kitchens. In addition to sixteen bedrooms there are also two reception areas, a storage room, and a courtyard in the center. There are also large intricately carved wooden panels that cover the inner windows on the first floor. The house survived economic and political upheavals, and was home to eight generations of the Huang family. By the mid-1980s the house stood empty. Local and national authorities, with the endorsement of the original owner's descendants, gave permission for the house (and its contents) to be relocated to the Peabody Essex Museum (PEM) in Salem, Massachusetts. The house opened in June 2003 as a permanent exhibit at the PEM. A children's book titled Piece by Piece was written by Susan Tan and illustrated by Justine Wong. It follows a young girl's adventure through the Museum and Yin Yu Tang House as she searches for a lost blanket. It was published by PEM and Six Foot Press in 2019.

The ship was named after Taormina, Sicily. Launched in 1908, she sailed from Genoa to New York and Philadelphia for most of her career. During World War I she was employed as a troopship carrying United States troops to France for one voyage in July 1918. She was scrapped in 1929.  History  Taormina was built in 1908 by D. & W. Henderson Ltd. of Glasgow for the Italia Soc. di Navigazione a Vapore, known as the Italia Line. Taormina sailed on her maiden voyage from Genoa to New York and Philadelphia beginning on 3 September 1908. In 1909, accommodations for 120 first-class passengers were added, and in 1910, her accommodations were again reconfigured so as to carry 60 first-class and 120 second-class passengers. After beginning her last Italia Line voyage on 16 December 1911, Taormina was taken over by Lloyd Italiano in 1912 and put in Genoa‚ÄìNew York service. When Lloyd Italiano, first purchased by Navigazione Generale Italiana (NGI) in 1911, was completely absorbed in 1918, Taormina began sailing under the NGI banner.

It was named for Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. Geography Holyoke Glacier, which heads in a large cirque and is fed by two glaciers from a small cirque on the south, has two weak medial moraines extending from spurs between its south tributaries. There are no lateral moraines, but there are a few morainic patches along the terminus. The glacier is longer than Barnard Glacier, and extends out over the lip of its hanging valley. In 1910, the glacier nowhere extended to the borders of its barren zone, and the mature spruce forest between the small terminal barren zone and the fiord demonstrates that it has not extended beyond this barren zone for a century or more. No distinct signs of recent advance were seen. The cliff glaciers on the ledges south of Holyoke Glacier present no unusual features.

Origins Mackenzie was the son of Colin Cam Mackenzie of Kintail (died 1594) and Barbara, daughter of John Grant of Grant. The Mackenzies were a clan from Ross-shire that had risen to prominence in the 15th century during the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles. Political advancement On 9 November 1594, soon after his father's death, Mackenzie made oath in presence of the King and the Privy Council that he would \\"faithfully, loyally, and truly concur, fortify, and assist his Majesty's Lieutenant of the North with his advice and force at all times and occasions as he may be required by proclamations, missive letters, or otherwise.\\" Under date of 18 February 1595 ‚Äì 1596, there is an entry in the records of the Privy Council that Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail \\"being elected and chosen to be one of the ordinary members\\" of the Council, and being personally present, makes faith and gives oath in the usual manner. Mackenzie's connections to central government were to prove invaluable to him in the turbulent times that lay ahead. He proved himself to be a masterful political operator but even he had to deal with potentially serious setbacks and the Privy Council's records show that he was on at least one occasion imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. Mackenzie was one of the eight Lesser Barons who constituted the Lords of the Articles in the Scottish Parliament which met for the first time on 17 June 1609. Although he was raised to the peerage on 19 November 1609, by the title of Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, he was not so designated in the Privy Council Records until 31 May 1610, when the patent of his creation was read and received by their Lordships, and he was thereupon acknowledged to be a free baron in all time coming. Mackenzie's peerage accompanied his final triumph in his long campaign for the Isle of Lewis. The conquest of Lewis Mackenzie's greatest opportunity arose from an internecine struggle within the Macleods of Lewis. Roderick \\"Old Ruari\\" Macleod of Lewis (c.1500-c.1595) divorced his wife, Janet (the daughter of John Mackenzie of Kintail and therefore Kenneth Mackenzie's great-aunt), and disowned his son by her, Torquil Cononach Macleod. By another wife, Roderick had another son, Torquil Dubh Macleod. After Roderick's death, Torquil Dubh retained Lewis, but Torquil Cononach (who had the support of central government) held the mainland Macleod estates at Coigach and Loch Broom. Torquil Cononach had no sons. His daughter and co-heir, Margaret, married Mackenzie's brother, Roderick (progenitor of the Earls of Cromartie), and the Mackenzies accordingly took up his cause against Torquil Dubh. In 1596/7, Mackenzie complained to the king of attacks made by Torquil Dubh on Coigach and Loch Broom. When Torquil Dubh failed to appear before the Privy Council on 11 February 1596/7, he was denounced as a rebel and Mackenzie obtained a commission of fire and sword against him. Torquil Dubh's rights to Lewis were forfeited and he himself was captured and beheaded in July 1597. Torquil Cononach surrendered his rights in Lewis to Mackenzie and identified Roderick Mackenzie as his heir in respect of Coigach and Loch Broom. However, a new obstacle to Mackenzie's campaign of self-aggrandisement now arose. In 1598, Lewis was granted to the Fife adventurers, with the professed object of civilising the inhabitants. Their colonising efforts over the next several years met with vigorous local resistance, which was intermittently and discreetly assisted by Mackenzie. At a meeting of the Privy Council, held at Edinburgh on 30 September 1605, Mackenzie received a commission to act for the King against Neil MacNeill of Barra, the Captain of Clanranald, and several other Highland and Island chiefs, who had \\"of late amassed together a force and company of the barbarous and rebellious thieves and limmers of the Isles,\\" and with them entered Lewis, \\"assailed the camp of his Majesty's good subjects,\\" and \\"committed barbarous and detestable murders and slaughters upon them.\\" Mackenzie was in consequence commissioned to pursue these offenders with fire and sword, by sea or land. This was the beginning of Mackenzie's conquest of Lewis. Mackenzie received another commission in Lewis on 1 September 1607 against Neil Macleod, another of Old Ruari's sons, who was conducting a guerilla campaign against the Fife adventurers and had recently captured the Castle of Stornoway. This commission was to continue in force for six months. Mackenzie at one point succeeded in fortifying his rights under Torquil Cononach's resignation with a deed under the Great Seal confirming his ownership of Lewis, but was compelled to surrender his rights to the King, who vested them in 1608 in Lord Balmerino (later forfeited for treason), Sir George Hay and Sir James Spens of Wormistoun. By covert support for local resistance, Mackenzie once again skilfully undermined their campaign to assert their rights, with the eventual result that they sold them to him for a substantial sum and a lease of his woods at Letterewe. Having had his rights confirmed by the King, Mackenzie returned to Lewis in 1610 with 700 men and finally brought the island to submission. Feud with the Macdonells of Glengarry Mackenzie's feud with the Macdonells of Glengarry may be said to have its origin in the revenge taken by two cousins of Glengarry for the murder of their fathers in Lochcarron in 1580. They burned the house of one of the murderers at Applecross, killing him and his family, and also slew in his bed Donald Mackenzie, who lived at Kishorn. Kenneth Mackenzie and Glengarry both went to Edinburgh to present complaints against each other, but Mackenzie is said to have got the better of his opponent by producing before the Privy Council Donald Mackenzie's shirt, covered in his blood. Glengarry fled the city and, although repeatedly summoned, failed to put in an appearance. The Records of the Privy Council under the date show of 9 September 1602 that he was declared outlaw and rebel. A commission of fire and sword was granted to Mackenzie against him and all his followers, with a decree of ransom for the loss of those who were burnt and plundered by him, and for Kintail's charges and expenses, making altogether a very large sum. Meanwhile, Angus Macdonell, Younger of Glengarry, had conducted a raid on Mackenzie's homeland at Kintail, killing several and carrying away a large spoil of cattle. Armed with his commission and accompanied by a large force, Mackenzie defeated Macdonell at Morar and drove back to Kintail \\"the largest booty ever heard of in the Highlands of Scotland\\". However, Glengarry's cousins continued to commit outrages, including raids on Kinlochewe and Applecross, and the conflict became broader and more general when Glengarry formed an alliance with the Macdonalds of Moidart and other Macdonalds against Mackenzie. Mackenzie, in his turn, sought assistance from his brother-in-law, Hector Og Maclean of Duart. While Mackenzie was in Mull securing Maclean's support, Glengarry's son (who was by now the real moving spirit behind the feud) launched a raid on Lochcarron. His galley was soon afterwards intercepted between Kylerhea and Kyleakin by a force of Mackenzie's men and he himself was killed, his body being brought back to Mackenzie's wife, who was holding the fort at Eilean Donan. Glengarry himself died the following year, in 1603. A cousin of his, Allan Dubh MacRanuil of Lundie committed one further great atrocity when he burned the church of Kilchrist in Easter Ross, killing the congregation gathered inside. Glengarry's piper is said to have marched around the flames, playing a pibroch which has been known ever since by the name of \\"Cillechriost,\\" as the family tune of the Macdonells of Glengarry. However, the Macdonells, despite their sanguinary excesses, were no match for the politically astute Mackenzie, who (in 1607) succeeded in obtaining a crown charter to the disputed districts of Loch Alsh, Lochcarron and others, and who steadily bought up the claims of third parties against Glengarry. Their differences were eventually settled by an arrangement which secured absolutely to Mackenzie all Glengarry's lands in Ross-shire and the superiority of all his other possessions, but Glengarry was to hold the latter, paying Mackenzie a small feu as superior.

In November 1943, the 595th moved to Drew Field, Florida, where it would remain for the duration of its active service. However, the Army Air Forces was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were not well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 The 592d was inactivated on 1 May 1944 at Drew Field, Florida.

Life and work =Early years= Henry Liverseege was born in Manchester, the son of Edmund Liverseege, a joiner. He was a weakly child who suffered from asthma and following his death in 1832 it was discovered that one of his lungs had failed to develop. He also had a spinal deformity which caused his left shoulder to be noticeably lower than the right. Even when in his twenties, he was reported to weigh as little as 70-75 lbs. Perhaps as a consequence of his infirmities, his father rejected him and he was brought up by his uncle John Green, a Manchester cotton mill owner. He was educated in a small Manchester school but did not progress to university. He showed an early interest in the arts, became involved in amateur theatricals for a while and demonstrated a talent for drawing. =Early career= The financially comfortable circumstances of Liverseege's uncle, allowed him to pursue a career as an artist and his earliest work was painting portraits for commissions at around five guineas each. He had no formal artistic training and contemporary critics described his portraits as 'indifferent'. No portraits attributed to him have apparently survived. He also painted a number of inn signs for Manchester hotels. This work equally brought only modest renumeration. =Later career= Around 1826, Liverseege graduated from painting inn signs and portraits to specialising in genre paintings based on characters and scenes from literature and folklore. His first genre paintings were exhibited at the exhibition of the Royal Manchester Institution in 1827. These were three small works 'Banditti Attacking Travellers', 'Banditti Carousing' and 'A Robber on the Outlook'. These sold, but only for small prices. He was more successful that same year with his painting of 'Adam Woodcock' from Walter Scott's The Abbot which was purchased by Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton, of Heaton Hall. The Scholar (1831, oil on canvas) He now made a number of visits to London where he sketched from works in the Royal Academy and the British Museum. He also attended some classes at a London art school. He applied to enter the Royal Academy as a student but was rejected on the technicality that he had failed to submit the required character references. While in London, he became acquainted with William Etty and with Sir Thomas Lawrence, the artist whose work he regarded as the finest. It was Lawrence who provided his letter of introduction to the Royal Academy. Despite their rejection of his application to study, he nevertheless exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1831 and one of his oil paintings, 'Sir Piercie Shafton and Mysie Happer', based upon characters from Walter Scott's 'The Monastery', was purchased by William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. The painting has remained in the Devonshire Collection to the present day. =Death= Liverseege's career was now beginning to take off and his work was selling well for decent prices. His health, however, rapidly declined towards the end of 1831 and by the beginning of 1832 he realised that death was near. In accordance with his dying wish, Liverseege's friend and patron Benjamin Hick saved many of the artist's sketches by mounting and placing them in a box that remained with the Hick family until 1909, before being sold at auction by Cape Dunne & Co. Manchester. Hick was the principle buyer of Leverseege's work including 'Agnes', 'The Betrothed', 'Falstaff and Bardolph', 'The Benediction', 'The Black Dwarf', 'The Fisherman', 'Friar Tuck', 'The Inquiry', 'Little Red Riding Hood', 'Lucy Ashton', 'The Orphan' and 'Captain Macheath'. Leverseege died at the house of his (now widowed) aunt, Grace Green, on 13 January and was buried at St Luke's Church, Rutland Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock. Thirty years after his death, when St. Luke's was rebuilt, a memorial was erected by a subscription raised by the editor of the Manchester Guardian. The church was demolished in the 1960s but the memorial was saved. He was the subject of several obituaries, some of which described him as 'The English Wilkie' comparing him with David Wilkie, the highly regarded Scottish painter. All recognised that had he lived, his talent would have brought him greater recognition. Paintings Liverseege's output was substantial given his short career. The largest collection of his works, 37 sketches, watercolours and oils, is held by the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester. Manchester Art Gallery also holds several of his paintings as well as the memorial stone which was erected in (the now demolished) St. Luke's Church. Works can also be found in Tate Britain and the National Army Museum. Shortly after his death a folio edition of engravings made from his paintings was published. This was published in a second edition in 1875. References ;Attribution * Sources *Allan Cunningham.

The building is situated on top of the dunes on the edge of the village of De Koog, Texel, approximately 200m from the North Sea beach. The hotel has its own beach cabins. The hotel has 96 rooms and suites, as well as six multifunctional conference rooms. In and around the hotel are three restaurants, a tennis court, a fitness room and a beauty & wellness center. The hotel has an active environmental policy and in 2005 it was the first tourist location in the Netherlands to receive the EU Ecolabel. History In 1934 Hein and Trijntje Wuis started a pension called Villa Op Duin. The pension was built beside a sandy road, and had no surrounding buildings. Architect was L.Igesz who also designed the Esperanto monument in Den Burg. The pension had eleven rooms and was its time far ahead with electric light, central-heating and warm and cold running water on each room. A pump system was installed to subtract the needed fresh water from the dunes. In the Second World War the hotel was confiscated by the Germans to house officers. In 1966 behind the villa a new wing with three floors and a restaurant was built. One year later the hotel was passed on to son Harry P. Wuis. In 1977 the floors were extended and an extra floor was built on top of the existing ones. Later (in 1988) the hotel build yet another extra wing. After twelve years of being assistant general manager, C. Den Ouden and his wife H. Den Ouden-Nuninga took over the hotel in the year 2000. In 2004 a brasserie named De Franse Slag and a restaurant named De Heeren XVII were added. Also a new stainless steel swimming pool was installed and a beauty & wellness center was opened.

Geography Population centres within the municipality include: Klukeville, Laur√©at, Omer, Otter Lake, and Sandy Creek. The village of Otter Lake is surrounded by Hughes Lake to the west, Lac de la Ferme (Farm Lake) to the east, McCuaig Lake to the south, and Lac √† la Loutre (Otter Lake) to the north. History In 1793, Huddersfield Township was established, named after its namesake in West Yorkshire, England. In 1866, Leslie Township was established, named after James Leslie (1786-1873), a Canadian senator. Also in 1866, the Otter Lake post office opened and the village that formed around the post office also came to have the same name. Since then, Philemon Wright, pioneer of the logging industry in Ottawa, operated a wood depot at Otter Lake. The industry has played and continues to play a leading role in the early and contemporary history of the village. In 1877, the United Township Municipality of Leslie- Clapham-et-Huddersfield was formed from its constituent townships. While Clapham Township was not officially established until 1920, it was already planned in the second half of the 19th century and named after a village north of Bedford, England. The united municipality was established because it was more advantageous to hold a municipal status than remain unorganized territory. In 2004 the United Township Municipality of Leslie-Clapham-et- Huddersfield became the Municipality of Otter Lake.

The scene can be viewed in Episode 8 of Series 2 where the plot-line reached early-to-mid 1919; however, the recording was not made until 29 December 1920.

Places with the same name are also found in many other garrison cities of Pakistan and India, such as Peshawar, Lahore, Kanpur, Ambala, Meerut and Delhi. Located to the south of Mall Road, Lalkurti Rawalpindi is a bazaar and a residential area from the British colonial era. The Lalkurti Bazaar area, formerly known as B I Bazaar (British Infantry Bazaar), is one of the busiest shopping areas of Rawalpindi cantonment. The importance of Lalkurti in the history of Rawalpindi and Pakistan lies in its once being the hub of Pakistan's military and political activities, especially in the 1960s, when Rawalpindi served as the interim capital of Pakistan. The first session of the third National Assembly of Pakistan was held on 8 June 1962 at Ayub Hall, Lalkurti.History of National Assembly of Pakistan, www.na.gov.pk  Population and demography  Lalkurti has a population of around 200,000, which includes a majority of Punjabis/Pothoharis and a minority of Urdu speaking Mohajirs, Kashmiris and Pathans. A significant proportion of population has roots in East Punjab. Besides Muslim majority, a significant minority of Christians and a very small number of Hindus also live in Lalkurti.  NUST building  The building hosting the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan (NUST), situated at the junction of Tameez-ud-din road (formerly called the Church road) and Mamoon Jee road, has a special historical significance. It was here in its Ayub Hall that the national legislative assembly sessions were held for some time in the 1960s. The capital had been shifted from Karachi to Islamabad, but the building for the National Assembly of Pakistan had not been constructed by then and Rawalpindi served as the interim capital of the country. Ayub Hall has been named after Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan, former president of Pakistan.  Schools and colleges  * Army Public School and College * Army Public College of Management Sciences (APCOMS) * Military College of Signals * SLS Montessori  Mosques, churches and temples  There are six mosques and a couple of churches (St. Joseph's Cathedral and Christ Church) in the locality. The Christian minority and the Muslims have always lived in exemplary cohesion. There are a few temples in Lalkurti which are a reminder of the Hindu population that lived here before partition. These temples are now in disuse and have been annexed into the neighbouring houses. The only temple being used for worship by a small presently existing Hindu population is the Balmik temple.

The Paraguayan city Fernando de la Mora is named in his honor. Childhood and youth  He was born in Limpio (formerly known as Tap√∫a) in 1773, in the family of Cavalry Captain Fernando de la Mora and Ana del Cazal who both belonged to families whose lineage descended from the Spanish conquistador Don Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala. Fernando received a good education. It is presumed that he studied at the College of San Carlos in Asunci√≥n. He also studied in Buenos Aires and National University of C√≥rdoba. He studied law, becoming one of the most educated citizens of the time.  Family  De la Mora had five brothers and a sister Rosa Isabel de la Mora Cazal. She married Mariano Antonio Mart√≠nez Viana, who was Congressman in 1811. From their marriage Francisca Carlota Viana de la Mora was born. Among his descendants was Juana Paula Carrillo Viana, wife of Don Carlos Antonio L√≥pez and mother of Francisco Solano L√≥pez. Fernando de la Mora was married to Josefa Antonia Cohene, and had five children.  Public life  He entered export trade business that allowed Mora to establish good relationships with his peers. After his father died in 1801 Fernando took over the management of the family property. In 1802 he was appointed deputy of Asunci√≥n by the Consulate of Buenos Aires, representing the union of merchants and held this position until 1804. His work at the port was useful in consolidating good relationships with the leading families of the city. Well educated and well liked, he was part of the small rural elite of Asunci√≥n and had social and commercial ties to major patrician families of Buenos Aires. He participated in the defense of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata against British invasions of the River Plate between 1806 and 1807 and helped to expel British from Montevideo, which they had occupied in 1807. In 1810 he started to work at the City Hall of Asunci√≥n. Politics De la Mora was a strong supporter of Paraguayan independence from Spain and participated in the Revolution of May 14, 1811. On 17 June, 1811 the First National Congress of Paraguay convened. Mariano Antonio Molas proposed that Congress removes the last Spanish governor Bernardo de Velazco y Huidobro from all posts. A new five-man ruling junta was created with Colonel Fulgencio Yegros as its President. Other members of junta were Dr. Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia, a skilled civilian figure, the young captain Pedro Juan Caballero representative of the troops that had defeated the invasion of Buenos Aires, a priest Francisco Xavier Bogarin and finally Don Fernando de la Mora, a civilian, who was linked to Paraguayan society. Soon after he had assumed his duties, de la Mora was appointed to lead a punitive expedition against the native Mbay√° people. In November 1812 he was sent to the Villa Real of Concepcion with orders to recover Fort Borbon which had been recently occupied by the Portuguese. Having noticed the withdrawal of the forces belonging to the strong neighboring to the fort of Coimbra, Mora established the City Hall of Concepcion, created by decree of the junta on 12 November, 1812. During the absence of Mora from the meetings of the junta for almost the entire year of 1812 Dr. Francia managed on to increase his own power. Knowing that Mora was opponent to his ideas, Francia responded by accusing Mora with intentions of joining Paraguay with Buenos Aires and with the loss of some secret state documents. He was referring to the additional article of the treaty of 12 October, 1811 signed on Asunci√≥n with the Manuel Belgrano, which the First Triumvirate of Buenos Aires used to unjustifiably apply taxes to Paraguayan tobacco and start a trade war. Francia, who had all the intentions of becoming the sole ruler of Paraguay, on 21 August, 1813 succeeded in removing Mora from the ruling junta.  Death Mora was implicated in the failed 1820 plot against Francia and was imprisoned for the rest of his life. His exact cause of death is uncertain, but it is assumed that he died in prison. Tribute On 6 October, 1923 Municipality of Asunci√≥n decided to pay tribute to Mora by giving his name to the avenue that begins on the \\"General Santos\\" street and ends at \\"Defensores del Chaco\\" Avenue.

Early life Smith was born in Mechanicsville, Tennessee. He attended the local schools before enrolling in the Nashville Military Academy. He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, but resigned and returned home. He subsequently took a position working for the Nashville & Decatur Railroad. American Civil War With Tennessee's Ordinance of Secession and the outbreak of the Civil War, Smith enlisted in the Confederate Army in the 20th Tennessee Infantry Regiment and was elected a second lieutenant.Warner, p. 284. He first saw combat action at the Battle of Mill Springs in January 1862, and in April of that same year participated in the Battle of Shiloh. Later in the year, after being promoted to colonel of the 20th Tennessee and assigned command of a small brigade, he was part of the Confederate forces that unsuccessfully tried to seize the Union post at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Confederate Army commander John C. Breckinridge remarked in his official report that Smith \\"moved against the enemy in fine style.\\"Official Records, Vol. 15, Part 1, p. 78. At the end of the year, he fought in the Battle of Stones River, where he suffered a serious wound that put him out of action for much of 1863. After his recuperation, Smith resumed field duties, but was again wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga in September. After another lengthy recovery period, he returned to action during the 1864 Atlanta Campaign. He was promoted to brigadier general on July 29, 1864, and commanded an infantry brigade (Tyler's Tennessee Brigade), assigned to Bates Division, Hardee's Army Corps in the Army of Tennessee comprising the 2nd, 10th, and 20th Tennessee, the 37th Georgia, the 30th, 37th, and 50th Tennessee, consolidated, and the 4th Georgia battalion of sharpshooters. His first action as a general officer on the extreme left of the Confederate flank at the Battle of Utoy Creek, he personally led his brigade in a charge against attacking Union soldiers capturing some 30 Union soldiers and the colors of the 8th Tennessee Infantry and 112th Illinois Infantry. The unit was cited in the OR by his corps commander, Lieut. Gen. Stephen D. Lee, to whom Bates Division was attached for duty. Smith led his brigade in an assault at the Battle of Jonesborough, however the terrific fire from the Federal entrenched troops, required them to withdraw to a gully for protection during the assault on August 30, 1864 and they were unable to dislodge the Federal Army of the Tennessee. His military career ended at the Battle of Nashville on December 16. Smith surrendered during the battle. After Smith had surrendered and been disarmed, Union Colonel William L. McMillen, whose brigade had suffered heavily in an engagement with Smith's Brigade, reportedly berated and then attacked the Confederate general, now a disarmed prisoner, with Smith's own sword (one source says \\"wantonly and repeatedly\\"). Smith's resultant brain injuries were so severe that for a time it was feared he would not live.SCV biography. Confederate General William B. Bate in his report stated, \\"General T. B. Smith, commanding Tyler's brigade, and Finley's, bore themselves with heroic courage both through good and evil fortune, always executing orders with zeal and alacrity, and bearing themselves in the face of the enemy as became reputations which each had heretofore bravely won.\\"Official Records, Vol. 45, Part 1, p. 750. Held at Johnson's Island in Ohio and later at Fort Warren in Massachusetts, Smith was not released until July 24, 1865. Post- war Smith recovered enough to be able to do some railroad work after the Civil War. He ran for a seat in the U.S. Congress in 1870, but lost the election. However, lingering effects of the savage beating caused permanent damage, and Smith spent much his last 47 years in an insane asylum in Nashville, emerging occasionally for army reunions and other social events. He was buried beside many of his former comrades in the Confederate Circle of Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville. He outlived McMillen by 21 years.

Early life Parrott was born at Row Green, a village in Somerset but his parents soon moved to Yorkshire. Parrott had no formal education and was essentially self-taught.Who was Who, OUP 2007 He began work in a brickyard at the age of eight years. Aged nine, he was working in a factory and just before his tenth birthday he started work at Methley Colliery as a pit-boy.The Times, 13 February 2004 In 1869 he had married Eliza Thompson of Methley and they had a son and three daughters. Miners Association official In 1872 he became the first checkweighman elected by the miners of Good Hope Pit, Normanton Common. From this time onwards he was drawn more and more into trade union work. In 1876 he was elected assistant secretary of the West Yorkshire Miners Association. Held this office until 1881 when the West and South Yorkshire Miners Associations were amalgamated to form the Yorkshire Miners Association of which Parrott was appointed agent, a post he held for 20 years. During this time he attended the first ever international conference of coal miners, held in Brussels. He became general-secretary of the Yorkshire Miners Association in 1904.The Times,10.11.05 Parrott was one of four men who were credited with the establishment of the Yorkshire Miners Association as it existed at the time of his death, the others being Ben Pickard, (Lib-Lab member of Parliament for Normanton from 1885‚Äì1904), J Frith and E Cowey. In January 1894 Parrott was appointed a representative of the Yorkshire Miners at a conciliation board meeting held at Westminster Palace Hotel to settle a dispute over miners‚Äô wages following a report by a committee headed by Lord Rosebery.The Times, 16 January 1994 Parrott remained a member of the miners‚Äô side of the conciliation board until the time of his death. Despite the work of the board, by 1896, Parrott was warning that miners had given their representatives authority to arrange strikes if the latest round of wage increases were not met and if mines were closed and men thrown out of work. He addressed a meeting of miners saying that Yorkshire was fully prepared to meet the emergency, that the men were well-organised and had both the funds and courage necessary. They were as determined as ever to fight for the maintenance and principle of the living wage.The Times, 16 July 1996 His work for the Miners Association took him into the wider trade union world and in 1899 he was elected auditor to the Standing Orders Committee of the TUC.The Times, 5.9.99 Politics Parrott had cut his teeth in politics locally and was a member of the Barnsley School Board for three years and had been an elected member of Barnsley Town Council for nine years. He was however contemplating a Parliamentary career and had been adopted as Liberal candidate in East Leeds. However the death of Ben Pickard the sitting Lib‚ÄìLab MP for Normanton in 1904 meant a vacancy and a by- election. Parrott was selected as candidate and he won the seat by a majority of 3,946 over his Conservative opponent.The Times, 2.3.04 There was no Liberal candidate as since 1885 the Yorkshire Miners Association had had an agreement with the Liberals allowing them nominate the candidate for elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Pickard had held the seat at each election under this arrangement since the 1885 general election and generally supported the Liberals in Parliament in return. Parrott was a member of the Liberal Party and again generally voted with the Liberals in Parliament. Parrott made his maiden speech in the House of Commons during the Finance Bill or budget debate on 19 July 1904, in opposition to a coal levy which he feared would lower the wages of miners or put their jobs at risk. There were already thousands of miners only working two days a week thanks to the levy as the coal owners were reducing costs by laying off men to claw back the money lost on the tax.The Times, 21 July 2004 On 18 February 1905, he was a member of a deputation of miners‚Äô representatives to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Austen Chamberlain to urge that the one shilling duty on export coal should be repealed. Death and successor Parrott died at Barnsley at 10.15 pm on 9 November 1905, having been ill in bed for a fortnight before and unconscious for two days. His health had not been good for some time having suffered a paralytic seizure in 1903.The Times, 10.11.05 His former Yorkshire Miners Association colleague Fred Hall was chosen to succeed Parrott as candidate in the by-election caused by his death. The Liberal Party again honoured their agreement not to stand against the Miners‚Äô candidate and Hall was returned unopposed as MP for Normanton, serving until 1933.

The village, which he called Kesrah, was described as having about 200 inhabitants. Gu√©rin also noted several ancient rock-cut cisterns, the largest of which was at the lower part of the village.Gu√©rin, 1875, p. 13 ff In 1882 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) noted that: \\"West of the village are foundations, and heaps of stones.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 402 SWP also described the village (called Kusrah) as: \\"A village of middling size, on low ground, with olive-trees.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 386. In the early years of the 20th century, towards the end of Ottoman rule, Qusra was part of the Jalud-based sheikhdom of Mashiyah Dar al-Haj Mahmud which was nominally administered by the Nasr Mansur family.Macalister and Masterman, 1905, p. 356 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Qusra had a population of 707, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Nablus, p. 25 increasing in the 1931 census to 851, still all Muslim, in 213 occupied houses.Mills, 1932, p. 64.

September 2011 \\"\\"Mo is a pig\\", graffiti by Israeli settlers from Esh Kodesh on the al-Nurayn Mosque of Qusra, 2011 On the night of 4‚Äì5 September 2011, a group of presumably Israeli settlers entered the village at 3 a.m., vandalized the village's Al-Nurayn mosque and tried to set it on fire. They smashed windows, rolled burning tires inside, and wrote \\"Muhammad is a pig\\" in Hebrew on its wall. The attack on the mosque came shortly after Israeli police officers had destroyed three illegal structures in the settlement outpost of Migron north of Jerusalem. According to Agence France Press, the graffiti also included a Star of David, and the name ‚ÄúMigron‚Äù. The attack, not the first of its kind, is viewed as part of a policy called ‚Äúprice tag‚Äù followed by a radical segment among the settlers, in which they respond to attempts by the Israeli security forces to demolish unauthorized Jewish settlements with attacks against Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack and called on the Middle East Quartet to get involved. The Israeli government also condemned the attack, and has instructed its authorities to ‚Äúbring those responsible to justice,‚Äù and urged all sides to avoid the potential for escalation. The European Union representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton issued a statement which strongly condemned the attack on the mosque, stating: \\"These provocations seriously undermine efforts to build the necessary trust for a comprehensive peace in the region; [...] attacks against places of worship undermine the freedom of religion or belief which is a fundamental human right,\\" calling on Israeli authorities \\"to investigate the attack, bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent such attacks happening again.\\" The United States Department of State also strongly condemned the ‚Äúdangerous and provocative attacks‚Äù on the mosque and called on those responsible to be arrested and ‚Äúsubject to the full force of the law‚Äù. Qusra lies outside the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority and depends on the Israeli military for protection, and its residents have no weapons. They organised a neighborhood watch consisting of between 15 and 20 volunteers, who patrol nightly. In case of trouble, the volunteers have instructions to phone the governor of Nablus who would contact the Israeli Army (IDF). According to Qusra mayor Hani Abu Murad, the patrol scared off settlers who had approached the village a few days after the mosque was defaced. On 23 September 2011, a group of about a dozen settlers from a nearby outpost approached Qusra, and a warning was announced from the mosque speakers. A large group from Qusra confronted the settlers, and threw stones, after which the Israeli Army arrived, protecting the settlers. The IDF first fired tear gas, then live rounds, killing one man, identified as Essam Kamal Badran, 35, by Qusra mayor Abu Murad, according to Haaretz. A statement from the IDF confirmed its troops had used live fire against the Palestinians after rocks were thrown at security personnel, and said it was working with Palestinian security officials to investigate. The incident received widespread publicity as it occurred just hours before Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas took the podium at the U.N. General Assembly, making his quest for recognition of a Palestinian state. November 2017 On 30 November 2017, a group of Israeli settlers, consisting of thirteen year old kids and two accompanying adult settlers went on a bar mitzvah hike near the village. The adults were armed with a M16 rifle and a pistol.An Israeli Settler, a Dead Palestinian and the Crux of the Conflict, Isabel Kershner, December 22, 2017, New York Times According to the Palestinian narrative, one of the Israeli settlers shot killed a local Palestinian man, Mahmoud Zael Oudeh, and the villagers then surrounded and pelted the settlers with rocks.

After the death of the two founders, the violist Luigi Sagrati became the main organizer of the quintet's recording and performing activities until the mid-nineties, when he had to quit public performances because of old age. The group toured Southern Africa in 1959 as Quintetto Boccherini, and were again in demand in 1960 as Quartetto Carmirelli di Roma.dedicated photos from the Southern Africa tours The quintet has recorded many LPs in Italy and abroad, mainly of music by Luigi Boccherini but also string quintets by Antonio Bazzini, Franz Schubert and Luigi Cherubini. Their records have been published by various recording houses like His Master's Voice, Fonit Cetra - Italia, Ensayo, EMI - Angel Records. A two-record album, played by Cervera, Buccarella, Sagrati, Scano and Stella, and entirely dedicated to Boccherini's quintets, and issued by the Spanish recording house Ensayo in 1976, won the Grand Prix du Disque of L'Acad√©mie Charles Cros. Some of the quintet's recordings have been re-issued on CD in the UK by Testament Records at the beginning of the 21st century. Members Many musicians played in the Quintet over the years. In addition to the two aforementioned founders, the original Quintetto included Dino Asciolla (who alternated with Carmirelli as first violin), Renzo Sabatini (viola) and Nerio Brunelli (cello). Among the most notable of the several other players one recalls Guido Mozzato, Montserrat Cervera, Arrigo Pelliccia, Marco Fiorini and Claudio Buccarella (violins); Marco Scano (first cello); Piero Stella (second cello); and Luigi Sagrati (viola). *violins **Pina Carmirelli (Varzi, 23 January 1914 ‚Äì Capena, 26 February 1993) **Dino Asciolla (Rome, 6 June 1920 ‚Äì Siena, 9 September 1994) **Alberto Poltronieri (Milan, 9 November 1892 ‚Äì Milan, 13 January 1983) **Arrigo Pelliccia (Viareggio, 20 February 1912 ‚Äì Rome, 19 July 1987) **Guido Mozzato *violas **Renzo Sabatini **Luigi Sagrati (Rome, 10 November 1921 ‚Äì Rome, 20 March 2008) *cellos **Arturo Bonucci (Sr.) (Rome, 19 April 1894 ‚Äì Rome, 11 January 1964) **Nerio Brunelli Discography Works by Antonio Bazzini: *Quintet in A major, Italia Fonit Cetra ITL 70046, 1978 (Cervera, Buccarella, Sagrati, Scano, Stella).

Some Sirloin Stockade restaurants have closed in recent years, some of which were in business for a significant amount of time. Overview Sirloin Stockade's first restaurant opened in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1966. The original location had a giant 1,800 pound (820 kg) plastic ornamental cow at the location circa the 1970s. Other locations also had, and some continue to have, such large ornamental cows on trailers and mounted atop outdoor signage. Sirloin Stockade restaurants provide an all-you-can-eat buffet, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sirloin Stockade fare include broiled steaks, chicken and fried shrimp, among others. In 2008, there were 28 company-owned and managed Sirloin Stockade restaurants and 74 restaurant franchises. As of June 2016, the company operated over 80 restaurants in 9 U.S. states and in Mexico. As of May 2019, the store locator lists only 15 locations. The restaurants are typically in size and have around 100‚Äì115 employees at each location. Circa December 2014, a Sirloin Stockade location in Galesburg, Illinois discontinued offering steak in its buffet due to escalating beef and food prices, but continued to offer steak as a menu item. =History= Sirloin Stockade has grown into Stockade Companies, a multi-concept restaurant company, presently based in Round Rock, Texas. In 2008, the CEO of Stockade Companies was Tom Ford, who began working for the company on its first day in 1966 as a dishwasher at the debut restaurant in Oklahoma City. Ford worked in additional positions while attending college, and purchased a Sirloin Stockade restaurant in 1979 in the Austin, Texas area. As of June 2016, Ford and Doug Frieling, a franchisee with the company, are the owners of Stockade Companies.

It consists of two hydrogen nuclei (protons) sharing a single electron. It is the simplest molecular ion. The ion can be formed from the ionization of a neutral hydrogen molecule . It is commonly formed in molecular clouds in space, by the action of cosmic rays. The dihydrogen cation is of great historical and theoretical interest because, having only one electron, the equations of quantum mechanics that describe its structure can be solved in a relatively straightforward way. The first such solution was derived by √ò. Burrau in 1927, just one year after the wave theory of quantum mechanics was published. Physical properties Bonding in can be described as a covalent one-electron bond, which has a formal bond order of one half. The ground state energy of the ion is -0.597 Hartree. =Isotopologues= The dihydrogen cation has six isotopologues, that result from replacement of one or more protons by nuclei of the other hydrogen isotopes; namely, deuterium nuclei (deuterons, ) or tritium nuclei (tritons, ). * = (the common one). * = (deuterium hydrogen cation). * = (dideuterium cation). * = (tritium hydrogen cation). * = (tritium deuterium cation). * = (ditritium cation). Quantum mechanical analysis The Schr√∂dinger equation (in the clamped-nuclei approximation) for this cation can be solved in a relatively straightforward way due to the lack of electron‚Äìelectron repulsion (electron correlation). The analytical solutions for the electronic energy eigenvalues are a generalization of the Lambert W function which can be obtained using a computer algebra system within an experimental mathematics approach. Consequently, it is included as an example in most quantum chemistry textbooks. The first successful quantum mechanical treatment of was published by the Danish physicist √òyvind Burrau in 1927, just one year after the publication of wave mechanics by Erwin Schr√∂dinger. Earlier attempts using the old quantum theory had been published in 1922 by Karel NiessenKarel F. Niessen Zur Quantentheorie des Wasserstoffmolek√ºlions, doctoral dissertation, University of Utrecht, Utrecht: I. Van Druten (1922) as cited in Mehra, Volume 5, Part 2, 2001, p. 932. and Wolfgang Pauli, Extended doctoral dissertation; received 4 March 1922, published in issue No. 11 of 3 August 1922. and in 1925 by Harold Urey. In 1928, Linus Pauling published a review putting together the work of Burrau with the work of Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule. =Clamped-nuclei (Born‚ÄìOppenheimer) approximation= Hydrogen molecular ion with clamped nuclei A and B, internuclear distance R and plane of symmetry M.The electronic Schr√∂dinger wave equation for the hydrogen molecular ion with two fixed nuclear centers, labeled A and B, and one electron can be written as : \\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + V \\\\right) \\\\psi = E \\\\psi ~, where V is the electron-nuclear Coulomb potential energy function: : V = - \\\\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 } \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{r_a} + \\\\frac{1}{r_b} \\\\right) and E is the (electronic) energy of a given quantum mechanical state (eigenstate), with the electronic state function œà = œà(r) depending on the spatial coordinates of the electron. An additive term , which is constant for fixed internuclear distance R, has been omitted from the potential V, since it merely shifts the eigenvalue. The distances between the electron and the nuclei are denoted ra and rb. In atomic units (ƒß = m = e = 4Œµ0 = 1) the wave equation is :\\\\left( -\\\\tfrac12 abla^2 + V \\\\right) \\\\psi = E \\\\psi \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{with} \\\\qquad V = -\\\\frac{1}{r_a} - \\\\frac{1}{r_b} \\\\; . We choose the midpoint between the nuclei as the origin of coordinates. It follows from general symmetry principles that the wave functions can be characterized by their symmetry behavior with respect to the point group inversion operation i (r ‚Ü¶ ‚àír). There are wave functions œàg(r), which are symmetric with respect to i, and there are wave functions œàu(r), which are antisymmetric under this symmetry operation: : \\\\psi_{g/u}(-{\\\\mathbf{r}}) = {} \\\\pm \\\\psi_{g/u}({\\\\mathbf r}) \\\\; . The suffixes g and u are from the German gerade and ungerade) occurring here denote the symmetry behavior under the point group inversion operation i. Their use is standard practice for the designation of electronic states of diatomic molecules, whereas for atomic states the terms even and odd are used. The ground state (the lowest state) of is denoted X2Œ£ or 1sœÉg and it is gerade. There is also the first excited state A2Œ£ (2pœÉu), which is ungerade. Energies (E) of the lowest states of the hydrogen molecular ion as a function of internuclear distance (R) in atomic units. See text for details. Asymptotically, the (total) eigenenergies Eg/u for these two lowest lying states have the same asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of the internuclear distance R: : E_{g/u} = - \\\\frac12 - \\\\frac{9}{4 R^4} + O\\\\left(R^{-6}\\\\right) + \\\\cdots The actual difference between these two energies is called the exchange energy splitting and is given by: : \\\\Delta E = E_{u} - E_{g} = \\\\frac{4}{e} \\\\, R \\\\, e^{-R} \\\\left[ \\\\, 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2R} + O\\\\left(R^{-2}\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\right] which exponentially vanishes as the internuclear distance R gets greater. The lead term was first obtained by the Holstein‚ÄìHerring method. Similarly, asymptotic expansions in powers of have been obtained to high order by Cizek et al. for the lowest ten discrete states of the hydrogen molecular ion (clamped nuclei case). For general diatomic and polyatomic molecular systems, the exchange energy is thus very elusive to calculate at large internuclear distances but is nonetheless needed for long- range interactions including studies related to magnetism and charge exchange effects. These are of particular importance in stellar and atmospheric physics. The energies for the lowest discrete states are shown in the graph above. These can be obtained to within arbitrary accuracy using computer algebra from the generalized Lambert W function (see eq. (3) in that site and the reference of Scott, Aubert-Fr√©con, and Grotendorst) but were obtained initially by numerical means to within double precision by the most precise program available, namely ODKIL. The red solid lines are 2Œ£ states. The green dashed lines are 2Œ£ states. The blue dashed line is a 2Œ†u state and the pink dotted line is a 2Œ†g state. Note that although the generalized Lambert W function eigenvalue solutions supersede these asymptotic expansions, in practice, they are most useful near the bond length. These solutions are possible because the partial differential equation of the wave equation here separates into two coupled ordinary differential equations using prolate spheroidal coordinates. The complete Hamiltonian of (as for all centrosymmetric molecules) does not commute with the point group inversion operation i because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of g and u electronic states (called ortho-para mixing) and give rise to ortho-para transitions Occurrence in space =Formation= The dihydrogen ion is formed in nature by the interaction of cosmic rays and the hydrogen molecule.

Given the very high densities that Theba pisana can attain at some sites, plus their apparently not particular feeding habits, their potential impact on the vegetation is cause for concern and should be further investigated. In many of these places T. pisana has become a problematic invasive species and a serious agricultural pest. This species is already established in the USA, and is considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce.

Different individuals may have shells with varying degrees of pale to dark brown markings. The markings, when present, may be in the form of uninterrupted spiral bands, spiral dotted lines, or small radial smudges. The shell can be found in various colour variants, but is basically yellow or white with dark color bands or spots and often a dark bluish grey apex. The shells of juveniles are sharply keeled, however the keel is not present on the final adult whorl. The aperture often has a lip that is light reddish on the inside, and the lip margin is only reflected at columellar side. The umbilicus is narrow and half covered by the reflected columellar margin. The apex has a characteristic size in the eastern Mediterranean when compared with other species, where there are no other Theba species. The umbilicus is also rarely seen in other species. Juveniles of Eobania vermiculata have a considerably larger apex. The width of the shell is 12‚Äì25 mm, but in Greece the adult shells are usually below 15 mm in width. The height of the shell is 9‚Äì20 mm. The visible soft parts are very light yellowish with dark colour bands running from the sides to the upper tentacles; the tentacles are very long. This snail is sometimes confused with Cernuella virgata, a species with a much smaller and less inflated shell.  Ecology  Theba pisana snails aestivate on fennel Foeniculum vulgare in Montbazin, France. Drawing of love dart of Theba pisana. Theba pisana usually lives in coastlands, in or near sandy habitats. In hot climates it aestivates often directly exposed to the sun, attached to grasses, shrubs or succulent plants, fence posts, tall weeds, and so on. It is common near beaches. In dunes it can live on nearly bare sand that is poorly fixed in place by grasses. In colder regions the snails do not aestivate, but they do climb on plants in dry weather. This snail does not survive serious winter frosts. Theba pisana is often associated with two other land snail species Cochlicella acuta and Cernuella virgata, but it can live slightly deeper inside pure sandy habitats, and is usually more common than Cochlicella acuta. It is one of the most common snails in coastal regions from south Portugal to Greece. In South Africa, a study showed that these snails were most abundant along roadsides; densities decreased dramatically with distance from roads. The snails were observed to be living on a variety of endemic and introduced plant species; these snails appear to be able to eat an unusually wide range of different food sources. Theba pisana is also a significant pest of citrus, vines, legume crops and cereals in South Africa. In Australia, it feeds on a range of agricultural plants. in Britain and France, Theba pisana has an annual life cycle, breeding in summer and autumn, while in the Mediterranean, they have a biennial life cycle with breeding in autumn and winter. In South Africa, Theba pisana appear to have an annual lifecycle, breeding in autumn to winter and growing to adult size of about 14 mm diameter by the end of the following summer. Maturity is reached at half maximum shell size after 1 year. Maximum shell size is attained after 2 years. This species of snail makes and uses love darts. The size of the egg is 2.2 mm.Heller J.: Life History Strategies. in Barker G. M. (ed.): The biology of terrestrial molluscs. CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK, 2001, . 1-146, cited page: 428. In South Africa, the population density can reach up to 300-700 snails m¬≤. In South Africa, these snails are active mostly at night and especially during periods of high humidity, irrespective of temperature. =Parasites= Theba pisana is an intermediate host for the terrestrial trematode parasite Brachylaima cribbi.Butcher A. R. & Grove D. I. (2006). \\"Seasonal variation in rates of sporocyst and metacercarial infection by Brachylaima cribbi in helicid and hygromiid land snails on the Yorke Peninsula, South Australia\\". Australian Journal of Zoology 53(6): 375-382. abstract.  Impact of invasions  In addition to the direct negative effect of Theba pisana feeding on agricultural crops, it also has several other additional effects. It uses the stalks of cereals as aestivating sites, which in turn clogs machinery and fouls produce during mechanical harvesting. According to Quick (1952)Quick H. E. (1952). \\"Emigrant British snails\\". Proceedings of the Malacological Society of London 29(5): 181-189. Theba pisana has been responsible for the extermination of native snail species as a result of competition for available food. In their report on the status and potential impacts of alien invasive organisms in the fynbos biome, MacDonald & Jarman (1984)MacDonald I. A. W. & Jarman M. L. (1984). \\"Invasive alien organisms in the terrestrial ecosystems of the fynbos biome, South Africa\\". South African National Scientific Programmes Report No. 85. predicted that Theba pisana would have very little impact on ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, energy flow and sediment dynamics or on the germination and succession processes of the plant community itself. However, the snail could seriously impact directly on fynbos plants, by feeding on them, and also displace native herbivores by competing with them for resources, and these effects have not been studied.

Vacancy The death of Benjamin Pickard the sitting Lib-Lab Member of Parliament for Normanton in 1904 meant a vacancy and a by- election in the division. Since 1885 the Yorkshire Miners Association had had an agreement with the Liberals allowing them nominate the candidate for elections to Parliament. Pickard had held the seat at each election under this arrangement since the 1885 general election and generally supported the Liberals in Parliament in return. Parrott shortly before his death Lib-Lab successor Miners‚Äô officials were expecting a contest between their president John Wadsworth and their treasurer Fred Hall. However, there was a third candidate, William Parrott, another Yorkshire Miners Association official. Although he had been canvassed as a possible candidate he was not expected to put his name forward as he was thought to be committed to a different constituency.The Times, 6.2.04 However, by the time the miners were asked to vote, the names of all three men were on the ballot paper. Parrott was selected and abandoned his candidature for the Liberals in East Leeds. The Liberals again decided not to oppose the miners‚Äô candidate and the Independent Labour party also chose not stand a candidate.The Times, 9.2.04 Parrott, as a member of the Liberal Party, could anticipate the votes of the general body of Liberals in his seat as well as the support of the miners.The Times, 12.2.04 In addition he had a strong and close association with the late MP, Benjamin Pickard, through his work as a trade unionist going back nearly 30 years.The Times, 13.2.04 The by-election issues The election was called for 1 March 1904. The Conservatives selected a London man, Marcus R P Dorman to oppose Parrott. Parrott‚Äôs election address emphasised four points. First he wanted an amendment of the law to secure greater freedoms for trade unions. He was particularly arguing for the restoration of the law on trade unions to what it had been before the Taff Vale case. His next policy opposed the 1902 Education Act. He regretted the abolition of school boards elected by ratepayers in their district, which had been popular with radicals and their replacement by local education authorities under the control of county or borough councils. Nonconformist electors objected that their local taxes were being used to support the teaching of religious views to which they were opposed, ‚ÄòRome on the Rates‚Äô was their rallying cry. Anglican and Roman Catholic church schools, supported by public funds, were not under public control and teachers in these sectarian schools were subject to religious tests. Parrott‚Äôs third policy priority was fiscal reform, in particular opposing a levy on the export of coal, as coal-owners were cutting wage rates and laying off miners to pay for this tax. Finally he was strongly in favour of the temperance movement. In addition to these points, Parrott made clear during the campaign that he was strongly opposed to preferential tariffs and in favour of the traditional Liberal policy of Free Trade, which was largely thought to favour working people with cheap food.The Times, 2.3.04 Also, the constituency had about 800 Irish electors who were expected to vote for Parrott. As a Liberal he was believed to be in favour of Home Rule but the religious aspects of the education issue complicated matters.The Times, 26.2.04 Dorman's campaign mostly consisted of his defence of the Conservative government and trying to convince the miners and other workingmen that he had their interests at heart.The Times, 20.2.04 & 25.2.04 He was in favour of taxation reform to protect British markets and opposed the immigration into Britain of what he described as destitute aliens.The Times, 25.2.04 The campaign atmosphere On the whole it was reported as being a quiet campaign compared with some. There was the usual round of public meetings but with the preponderance of outside help and speakers being on the Lib-Lab side and the Conservative candidate suffering more at the expense of hecklers at his events.The Times, 23.2.04 A later report indicated that Dorman had more or less had to cope single-handedly with very few outside speakers coming in to support his candidature. It was also reported that support for Parrott from Parliamentary speakers had been less than anticipated with many village meetings in the mining areas having been only sparsely attended but this was not helped by the weather which was generally cold and snowy.The Times, 29.2.04 One interesting aside, the two candidates took part in a football match on Saturday 27 February between teams from Normanton and Dewsbury, with Dorman kicking off the first half and Parrott kicking off the second. The result is not reported. On polling day the weather continued cold and there was light snow in the air but the snow was not severe enough to interfere with the election. Parrott toured the constituency in a carriage and pair, Dorman had the use of a motor- car. The result Despite worries that there might be some apathy in the electorate in view of the previous Lib-Lab domination of the seat and a slow turn-out in the early part of the day Parrott polled 6,855 votes to Dorman's 2,909; a majority of 3,946 (from an electorate of 14,898). This was a larger vote than Pickard had received in all the five previous elections since 1885 and a larger majority than Pickard had ever achieved. Parrott served as MP for Normanton until his death in November 1905. He was succeeded as MP by his former Yorkshire Miners Association colleague Fred Hall.

Carlson et al., ‚ÄúCircesium ‚Äî ‹©‹™‹©‹ù‹£‹ù‹ò‹¢ ‚Äù in The Syriac Gazetteer last modified June 30, 2014, http://syriaca.org/place/62. known in Arabic as al-Qarqisiya, was a Roman fortress city near the junction of the Euphrates and Khabur rivers, located at the empire's eastern frontier with the Sasanian Empire. It was later conquered by the Muslim Arabs in the 7th century and was often a point of contention between various Muslim states due to its strategic location between Syria and Iraq. The modern town of al-Busayra corresponds with the site of Circesium. Etymology and location The name Circesium or castrum Circense is of Graeco-Roman origin and translates as \\"the castle with the circus\\".Streck 1978, p. 654. Qerqusion (also spelled Qarq≈´sy≈çn) and al-Qarqƒ´siyƒÅ (also spelled 'Qarqƒ´sƒ´ƒÅ) are the Syriac and Arabic versions of the Latin name, respectively. The Parthian transliteration, attested in Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, is Krksy æ. The etymology of the name was known to the medieval Muslim geographer, Hamza al- Isfahani, who wrote al-Qarqƒ´siyƒÅ stemmed from qirqƒ´s, the Arabicized form of \\"circus\\". The ancient site was situated at the eastern bank of the Euphrates River, adjacent to the confluence of the Khabur River. History =Antiquity= A Roman military station likely existed in this location as early as 256 AD as the place is listed in King Shapur I's (240‚Äì270) inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, among towns taken from the Romans in 256 during the second Roman campaign. Later, having reverted to Roman hands, Emperor Diocletian (284‚Äì286) further enforced Circesium into a strongly fortified outpost on the far eastern frontier of the empire, in order to improve the defensive capabilities against the Sasanians. Circesium was ceded to the Sasanids by Emperor Jovian (363‚Äì364) in a treaty signed in 363.Encyclopaedia of Islam. Nw Ed. IV: Karkisiya. p.654. In early 363, during his ill-fated Sasanian campaign, Emperor Julian (361‚Äì363) moved through Circesium and crossed the Khabur River by using a pontoon bridge. According to contemporary sources, the cenotaph of Emperor Gordian III (who had been killed during his own Sasanian campaign of 244), was still visible at Zaitha (which was located nearby Circesium) when Julian and his army moved through the area. It was again restored to the Romans and according to the Notitia Dignitatum, Circesium was the headquarter of Legio IV Parthica until the 5th century. The fortress of Circenium was restored and extended by Emperor Justinian I (527‚Äì565) during his efforts \\"to reorganize the system of border protection at the beginning of his reign\\". Joseph Wieseh√∂fer / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica notes that this might have been one of the reasons why Sasanian King Khosrow I (531‚Äì579), during his offensive in 540, decided to invade the Roman Empire further to the north, \\"along the western bank of the Euphrates\\". Circesium, due to these reorganization efforts by Justinian I, eventually became the garrison site of a dux. In 573, during Khosrow I's offensive during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 572‚Äì591, the Sasanian King ordered General Adarmahan to cross the Euphrates near Circesium in order to attack the eastern Byzantine provinces from there. In 580, Circesium was turned into the garrison base for Emperor Maurice's offensive during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 572‚Äì591. During the flight of Khosrow II (590‚Äì628) in 590, the latter was briefly sheltered by the Byzantine garrison commander of Circesium, Probus, before moving to Hierapolis. =Medieval era= During the Muslim conquests, Circesium was captured from the Byzantines without resistance by a Muslim army commanded by Habib ibn Maslama al-Fihri, himself dispatched by the Muslim governor of Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), Iyad ibn Ghanm. Though many Muslim sources state this occurred in 637, it more likely occurred in 640. According to Joseph Wieseh√∂fer / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, in all likelihood, Circesium was recaptured shortly after by the Byzantines. However, in 690-691, during the reign of Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (685‚Äì705), Circesium became a definitive part of the Umayyad Caliphate. The city afterward became the capital of the Khabur district of the Jazira province. During the Second Muslim Civil War, Circesium became the headquarters of the Qaysi tribal leader Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi who recognized the caliphate of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in rebellion against the Umayyads.Streck 1978, p. 655. Abd al-Malik was forced to contend with Zufar before he could embark on his conquest of Iraq from the Zubayrids.Streck 1978, pp. 654‚Äì655. To that end, he besieged Circesium around 690 and after several months, Zufar ultimately surrendered and defected to the Umayyads. In the late 9th century, the autonomous governor of Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun, extended his domains as far as Circesium, but the Abbasids under al-Muwaffaq recaptured it in 881. The city, alongside nearby al-Rahba, played an important role in the struggles involving the Hamdanids who ruled the Jazira autonomously during the 10th century. According to Istakhri and Ibn Hawqal, al-Qarqƒ´siyƒÅ/al-Qarqƒ´sƒ´ƒÅ (Circesium) was a flourishing city as late as the 10th century. In 1265, the Mamluk sultan Baybars captured Circesium from the Mongols, massacring its Mongol and Georgian garrison.Amitai-Preiss 1995, p. 115. However, the fortified city was back in Mongol hands by 1281. Due to its strategic location, Muslim geographers throughout the Islamic era mentioned Circesium but gave no detailed account of the city in their descriptions of the region. This may indicate that Circesium did not become a large town under the various Muslim dynasties that ruled it. =Modern era= The site of Circesium is today occupied by the town of al-Busayra. Writing in the early 20th century, historian M. Streck wrote that al-Busayra was a village of thirty to forty clay houses adjacent to a large site of ruins. Bishopric The bishopric of Circesium was a suffragan of Edessa, the capital of the Roman province of Osrhoene. A Nestorian writer says that a Bishop Jonas of this see was one of the participants at the First Council of Nicaea (325) who had suffered mutilation during the preceding persecution. However, his name does not appear in the authentic list. Abrahamius, took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of the province of Osrhoene sent to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458 regarding the murder of Patriarch Proterius of Alexandria. Nonnus was a supporter of Severus of Antioch and was expelled by Emperor Justin I in 518. He also acted as a representative of the Monophysites at a conference held in Constantinople in 532. Davithas (David) was a member of the council called by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536, and Thomas was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. Michael the Syrian lists fourteen Jacobite bishops of the see, apart from Nonnus, the last being of the 11th century.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 977-980Raymond Janin, v.

Strivers' Section was historically an enclave of upper-middle-class African Americans, often community leaders, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It takes its name from a turn-of-the-20th-century writer who described the district as \\"the Striver's section, a community of Negro aristocracy.\\" The name echoes that of Strivers' Row in Harlem, a New York City historic neighborhood of black professionals. The district is roughly bounded by Swann Street and the Dupont Circle Historic District on the south, Florida Avenue and the Washington Heights Historic District on the north and west, and the Sixteenth Street Historic District on the east. The historic district is mostly composed of apartment buildings and rowhouses, many of which have been home to notable individuals including Frederick Douglass, Lewis Henry Douglass, and Calvin Brent. Architectural styles represented in Strivers' Section include Italianate, Queen Anne, Romanesque Revival, and Second Empire. Architects and real estate developers whose works are in the district include George S. Cooper, Thomas Franklin Schneider, B. Stanley Simmons, Harry Wardman, and Frank Russell White. The historic district, which includes around 430 contributing properties, was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1983 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Geography The Strivers' Section Historic District is located on the north end of Dupont Circle, a historic district and neighborhood in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. The boundaries of the historic district are roughly Swann Street and the Dupont Circle Historic District on the south, Florida Avenue and the Washington Heights Historic District on the north and west, and the Sixteenth Street Historic District on the east. In addition to Florida Avenue, major roads that pass through the district are 17th Street, 18th Street, New Hampshire Avenue, and U Street. There are approximately 430 contributing properties in the historic district, built between 1875 and 1946. Around 50 buildings, including the DC Police's Third District headquarters, are non-contributing. Significant contributing properties in the district include Old Engine Company No. 9 and the following apartment buildings: The Albemarle, The Belgrade, The Kirkman, The Livingston, The Melwood, The Saint Clair, The Vernon, Willard Courts, The Wilton, and The Windermere-Harrowgate. History =19th century= The present-day historic district was envisioned as part of the capital city by Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1791 plan, but the area remained rural and undeveloped for several decades. Holmead's Burying Ground was established in 1794 and for almost 100 years operated as a public cemetery on the southwestern border of today's Strivers' Section. The bodies were later reinterned at other cemeteries in the city. Widow's Mite, later known as Oak Lawn, was an estate located on the western edge of the district on the site of the present-day Washington Hilton. By 1852, plans were drawn up for 11 squares subdivided by streets and alleys, but the rural landscape remained largely uninhabited except for scattered frame houses and shanties occupied by working class people. The first sign of development in the district's vicinity was the construction of military camps during the Civil War. One of these camps, Camp Barker, was located near 14th and U Streets. It served as a haven for African Americans during the war and along with two other camps, developed into neighborhoods for the city's African American residents. During the Civil War the Washington and Georgetown Company's horse-drawn streetcar line opened along 14th Street and spurred development in the area. Seeing the potential for real estate in close proximity to the streetcar line, developers purchased parcels of land in the area which at the time was owned by one person. One of these developers was Henry A. Willard who founded the Willard Hotel. A street named after him runs through the center of the historic district. Frederick Douglass owned three of the buildings at 17th and U Streets NW. In the early 1870s Alexander \\"Boss\\" Shepherd, who served as head of the city's Board of Public Works, led a massive improvement in the city's street layout including in the Strivers' Section. Over 150 houses were built in the area between 1873 and 1875, transforming what had been a rural part of the city to an active residential neighborhood. These original buildings, some of which were later demolished, included simple frame dwellings and larger more elaborate homes. Surviving examples include a large number of Italianate buildings on 17th Street, Seaton Street, and T Street. Early residents included working class people and professionals, African Americans and whites, but the area became most strongly identified with the African American middle class and elites who were attracted by public transit and nearby Howard University. One of these early residents was writer and statesman Frederick Douglass, who purchased three Second Empire style homes on the corner of 17th and U Streets in 1877 as a real estate investment. Douglass' son, Lewis, lived at 2002 17th Street NW for over 30 years. James E. Storum, who founded the Capital Savings Bank, lived next door. The earnings Frederick Douglass received from these real estate ventures, along with his writings and speaking engagements, ensured his financial security during retirement at Cedar Hill. There was significant development in the area following the 1893 arrival of the Rock Creek Railway Company's electric streetcar service that was extended along U Street. During the next two decades over half of the historic district's buildings, including the prominent Old Engine Company No. 9, were constructed and rows of mostly Queen Anne style houses were built. The neighborhood demographics also began a gradual shift from almost exclusively African American to a mixture that included middle class whites. Although they lived in close proximity, both races rarely socialized with each other and generally lived on specific streets in the neighborhood. =20th century= The Albemarle was built in 1900 and designed by Thomas Franklin Schneider. Most of the residential buildings constructed in the early 1900s were larger and catered to the middle class. This included architect Calvin Brent, who lived at 1700 V Street NW and designed the house next door, 1704 V Street NW, and the city's Recorder of Deeds James C. Dancy. The row of Romanesque Revival houses along the north side of the 1700 block of U Street were built in 1902 and designed by architect Nicholas T. Haller, one of several prominent local architects whose designs are represented in the historic district. George S. Cooper, Albert H. Beers, William C. Allard, Thomas M. Haislip, Nicholas D. Grimm, and Louis D. Meline are some of the architects who designed houses along Florida Avenue, 17th Street, T Street, U Street, V Street, and Willard Street. The residential buildings constructed during this period also included apartments, several of which are small and resemble rowhouses, and medium sized buildings including: The Saint Clair at 1717 T Street NW, designed by Cooper in 1903, The Wilton at 1931 17th Street NW, designed by Beers in 1908, and The Livingston at 1741-43 T Street NW, designed by Hunter & Bell in 1917. The large apartment buildings were constructed on more prominent lots. Examples include: The Albemarle at 1830 17th Street NW, designed by Thomas Franklin Schneider in 1900, The Melwood and The Vernon at 1768 and 1774 U Street NW, designed by B. Stanley Simmons in 1906, The Belgrade and The Kirkman at 1918 and 1930 18th Street NW, designed by Beers and built by Harry Wardman in 1908, and Willard Courts, designed by Frank Russell White and built by Wardman in 1915. There were a few large apartment buildings constructed during the 1920s including The New Williamsburg at 1621 T Street NW, designed by Stern & Tomlinson in 1925 in the Classical Revival style, and The Windermere-Harrowgate at 1825 and 1833 New Hampshire Avenue NW, also designed by Stern and Tomlinson in 1925 in the Tudor Revival style. Commercial properties built during this period include 1610 U Street NW, constructed in 1921 for American Motor Schools and designed by Appleton P. Clark Jr.. By the 1920s U Street between 7th and 17th Streets featured numerous African American businesses and entertainment venues while Dupont Circle remained an almost exclusively white neighborhood. The demographics of the Strivers' Section once again changed during this decade, from a mixed-race community to a mostly middle-class African American one. It was during this decade when the area earned its nickname. Strivers' Section was originally a derisive term that described neighborhoods where African Americans had purchased homes from white residents. These people were supposedly \\"striving to get beyond members of their own race.\\" But the term Strivers' Section was reclaimed as a positive description by people including social historian William Henry Jones, who praised \\"negro pioneers\\" that didn't limit themselves to segregated areas of the city. Facing west down Willard Street with the Washington Hilton in the background. White residents on the neighborhood's southern border created a racially restrictive covenant that blocked African Americans and Jews from living on their streets. This was challenged in courts, but the covenants were ruled legal. Many of the African Americans who continued to live in Strivers' Section during this period were prominent members of their community, but in certain areas such as Seaton Street, poor residents struggled. Gordon Parks photographed Seaton Street and its residents to demonstrate the effects poverty and racism had on the community. After racial covenants were ruled unconstitutional in the 1948 Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer, African American residents of Strivers' Section were no longer limited to which neighborhoods they could live in and began to move to other areas of the city. During the next decades poverty and crime became a serious issue in Strivers' Section, made worse by the devastation following the 1968 riots. Although some historic buildings were demolished in the following decades, including ones on U Street that were replaced with the DC Police's Third District headquarters in 1974, most of the urban renewal plans that would have dramatically changed the neighborhood's appearance did not take place. In the early 1980s four Dupont Circle neighborhood organizations wanted to expand the Dupont Circle Historic District's boundaries to include Strivers' Section, but the Joint Committee on Landmarks chose to designate the latter as its own historic district. The Strivers' Section Historic District was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on June 30, 1983, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 6, 1985. Historians noted that in addition to Douglass, Dancy, and Brent, who is most known for designing St. Luke's Episcopal Church, a National Historic Landmark, past residents included Howard University faculty member Joseph Lealand Johnson, the second African American to earn both a Ph.D. and an M.D. Although not within the historic district's boundaries, there were a number of prominent African Americans who lived nearby. These included poets Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson, educator Lucy Diggs Slowe, military officer Benjamin O. Davis Sr., opera singer Todd Duncan, attorney Charles Hamilton Houston, civil rights activist Dutton Ferguson who challenged segregation on U Street, and ophthalmologist Arthur Curtis and his wife Helen who were the subjects of the Corrigan v. Buckley Supreme Court case that involved racially restrictive covenants. Since the designation of the historic district, the restoration of buildings in the district and the development spurred by the opening of Metro's U Street station has led to a diverse demographic residing in Strivers' Section.

Son of Colonel Jose del Carmen Perez, conventional in the Constituent Assembly 1870 and Juana Rosa Acosta. He joined the school of the Church of Encarnaci√≥n in the capital. In 1901 he made his first encounter with the Silesians to register as a craftsman student Monsignor Lasagna School led by father Turriccia. In 1903, just a youngster, he traveled to Uruguay to begin his studies at the Seminary of Manga, near Montevideo. He was ordained priest in 1916, prayed his first Mass in Asuncion in the new chapel of his former school, which was incorporated as a teaching exercise that lasted for eleven years. Priesthood In the first year of priesthood there was a transcendent fact, the creation of the notorious Battalion Scouts which it named Don Bosco. With this contingent, under his spiritual direction, they toured large parts of the country marching on foot for a variety of countryside cities of the country. He began his work of education and civic education of young children and Paraguayans, an activity which lasted nearly six decades. The figure of father Perez soon acquired notoriety; his appealing and educated personality, his affable treatment, and firm discipline of his actions gave him prestige and popularity. In his priestly ministry he had a very active performance. In 1927 he was appointed director of the Salesian College of the Sacred Heart (Salesianito) and the following year he was appointed Councilor of the City of Asunci√≥n. Experience in Chaco War In 1930 he was director of the Institute of San Jose Concepcion. At the outbreak of the Chaco War 1932 and as he observed the boarding of the first items to the Chaco and former students - students, could not avoid, snatched by their impulses, accompany them on their uncertain fate. Appointed chaplain, became famous for his participation in the defense of the fort Nanawa, which crashed unsuccessfully powerful Bolivian forces. Among Masses and confessions, when the situation of defenders was critical, EPI Perez, under its own story, did not hesitate to pawn the gun and join the bloody battle that marked the crystallization of heroism Paraguayan. The figure of the victorious commander, Colonel Irrazabal he awoke a great admiration, that was mutual affinity, as the warrior kept a respect for the priest unparalleled. He was chaplain, shortly thereafter, the III Corps. On December 11, 1934, Las Moras in the fort, received the medal Cruz del Chaco, a chance to celebrate the anniversary of the victory of Field Way, the most brilliant tactical operation of the entire war. On this stage of his life Father Perez wrote the book published in two volumes titled \\"The struggle of Chaco: what he saw, heard and knew a chaplain\\" After the contest, Father Perez, holding the rank of colonel in the nation, returned to their usual activities. In 1936 was ed. Rumbos, body expression of the Catholic Church and two years later was elected vice president of the Paraguayan Federation of Scouting. On February 20 founded the legendary Battalion Rojas Silva, long memory, naming by the lieutenant who gave tribute to fallen Paraguayan of that name in the fort Surprise, in the run-up to the war. That unit was enriched with the addition of hundreds of young people there learned how to conduct themselves within a framework of uncompromising behavior, acquired stoic spirit, love of country and spiritual formation. It was the forge of which emerged over the years, prominent artists, musicians, athletes and business men possessed all of them deep feelings of Christians. The body of Scouts marched in towns and cities in the interior accompanied by a cast of waiter‚Äôs popular artists and the musicians whose resonances bands aroused lethargy of the monotonous existence of men in the field. Its theatrical evenings were great rejoicing for the inhabitants and very soon some names of its components were notorious.

This can yield a variety of benefits such as fault tolerance, increased bandwidth, or improved security.  Wireless networks  To improve performance or fault tolerance: Concurrent multipath routing (CMR) is often taken to mean simultaneous management and utilization of multiple available paths for the transmission of streams of data. The streams may be emanating from a single application, or multiple applications. A stream is assigned a separate path, as uniquely possible given the number of paths available. (If there are more streams than available paths, some streams will share paths.) This provides better utilization of bandwidth by creating multiple transmission queues. It provides a degree of fault tolerance in that should a path fail, only the traffic assigned to that path is affected. There is also, ideally, an alternative path immediately available upon which to continue or restart the interrupted stream. CMR provides better transmission performance and fault tolerance by providing: *Simultaneous, parallel transport over multiple carriers. *Load balancing over available assets. *Avoidance of path discovery when reassigning an interrupted stream. Shortcomings of CMR are: *Some applications may be slower in offering traffic to the transport layer, thus starving paths assigned to them, causing under- utilization. *Moving to the alternative path will incur a potentially disruptive period during which the connection is re-established. = True CMR = A more powerful form of CMR (true CMR) goes beyond merely presenting paths to applications to which they can bind. True CMR aggregates all available paths into a single, virtual path. Applications send their packets to this virtual path, which is de-multiplexed at the Network Layer. The packets are distributed to the physical paths via some algorithm including round-robin or weighted fair queuing. Should a link fail, succeeding packets are not directed to that (/those) path(s). The stream continues uninterrupted, transparently to the application. This method provides significant performance benefits over the application level CMR: *By continually offering packets to all paths, the paths are more fully utilized. *No matter how many nodes (and thus paths) fail, so long as at least one path constituting the virtual path is still available, all sessions remain connected. This means that no streams need to be restarted from the beginning and no re-connection penalty is incurred. True CMR can, by its nature of using differing routes, causes out-of-order delivery (OOOD) of packets. That is severely debilitating for standard TCP. Standard TCP, however, has been exhaustively proven to be inappropriate for use in challenged wireless environments and must, in any case, be augmented by a facility, such as a TCP gateway, that is designed to meet the challenge. One such gateway tool is SCPS-TP, which by using the Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK) capability instead of ACK all datagrams, deals successfully with the OOOD problem. Another important benefit of true CMR, desperately needed in wireless network communications, is its support for enhanced security. Simply put, for an exchange to be compromised, multiple of the routes it traverses must be compromised. The reader is referred to the references in the ‚ÄúTo improve network security‚Äù section for discussion on this topic. Capillary routing In networking and in graph theory, capillary routing, for a given network, is a multi-path solution between a pair of source and destination nodes. Unlike shortest-path routing or max-flow routing, for any given network topology - only one capillary routing solution exists. Capillary routing can be constructed by an iterative linear programming (LP) process, transforming a single-path flow into a capillary route. # First minimize the maximal value of the load on all of the network routing node links #* Do that by minimizing an load upper bound value that is applied to all links. #* The full mass of the flow will be split equally across the possible parallel routes. # Find the bottleneck links of the first layer (see below), then set their loading amount at the found minimum. # Additionally, minimize the maximal load of all remaining links, but now without the bottleneck links of the first layer. #* This second iteration further refines the path diversity. # Next, we determine the bottleneck links of the 2nd network layer. #* Again, minimize the maximal load of all remaining links, but now without the bottlenecks of the 2nd network layer as well. # Repeat this algorithm until the entire communication footprint is enclosed in the bottlenecks of the constructed layers. At each functional layer of the network protocol, after minimizing the maximal load of links, the bottlenecks of the layer are discovered in a bottleneck detection process. # At each iteration of the detection loop, we minimize the sending of traffic over all links having maximal loading, and being suspected as bottlenecks. # Links unable to maintain their traffic load at the maximum are eventually removed from the candidate path list. # The bottleneck detection process stops when there are no more links to remove, because this best path is now known. The animated image shows capillary routing footprint between a pair of nodes in a mobile ad-hoc network.

The core campus area was located between Lyman Street and Chauncy Lake, north of Massachusetts Route 9. The hospital was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The hospital was established in 1884 on the grounds of the State Reform School for Boys. The existing buildings were renovated to accommodate the needs of a mental hospital and was opened on December 1, 1886. This was the first homeopathic hospital for the insane established in New England; but such hospitals existed in New York, Michigan, and perhaps other states. The pioneering African-American psychiatrist Solomon Carter Fuller spent the majority of his career practicing at the hospital in the early 1900s. While there, he performed his ground-breaking research on the physical changes to the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The hospital was closed in 2010, in anticipation of a new Worcester State Hospital opening in 2012. The ten-bed Deaf Unit, the two Adolescent Units, and the Intensive Residential Treatment Program (one step below State Hospital Level) programs were closed by June 2010. On May 9, 2015, a memorial service was held in nearby Pine Grove Cemetery for the more than 500 patients who died at Westborough State Hospital and whose remains were unclaimed and subsequently buried in a potter's field. The service was part of a larger effort to put names to the graves of the deceased. Despite being on the historic register, the entire hospital complex was demolished during the summer of 2019. A senior living complex is currently being built at the same location as the state hospital was.

He served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1848 to 1849, the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 17th district from 1867 to 1868 and as chief justice of the territorial courts in the Wyoming Territory from 1871 to 1879. Early life and career Joseph W. Fisher was born in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, and was educated in the local schools. He studied law and passed his bar exam. Licensed as an attorney, he established a profitable legal practice serving the Northumberland County region. He served as a member of Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1848 to 1849. Civil War service When war broke out and the Pennsylvania Reserves were organized, Fisher became lieutenant colonel of the 5th Pennsylvania Reserves. He was promoted to the rank of colonel on July 1, 1862, after Col. Seneca G. Simmons was killed in action at the Battle of Glendale. Fisher led the 5th Reserves at the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Fredericksburg in the Reserves Division under the command of Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. At the latter battle, Fisher succeeded to command of 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division of the I Corps, when Brig. Gen. Conrad Feger Jackson was killed during Meade‚Äôs assault on the Confederate right flank. The Reserves were removed from the field to recover from hard service in 1862, and Fisher commanded the brigade in the XXII Corps, Department of Washington. When two brigades of the Reserves returned to the field in 1863, commanded by Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford, Colonels Fisher and William McCandless led these units in the V Corps. They fought at the Battle of Gettysburg on the left flank of the army. Fisher‚Äôs service in that battle is controversial. Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain reported that his 20th Maine Infantry and Fisher‚Äôs Brigade were sent to occupy Big Round Top late on July 2, 1863. Chamberlain claimed that Fisher was unwilling to advance against unknown odds and that his unit, battle worn as it was, had to lead the way. Fisher‚Äôs report shows no evidence of such hesitation. He credits the 20th Maine with leading as the skirmish line because of better weapons.Civil War Home Retrieved 2008-10-20. Fisher continued in command of his brigade well into 1864. He fought in the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. His last action as brigade commander was the Battle of Cold Harbor. Fisher was mustered out with his regiment on June 15, 1864. He later served as colonel of the 195th Pennsylvania Infantry. Fisher was mustered out with that regiment on January 31, 1866. He received a Brevet promotion to the rank of brigadier general on November 4, 1865. Postbellum career After the war, Fisher resumed his legal career. He was elected to serve in the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 17th district from 1867 to 1868. Later, he moved to the Wyoming Territory and served as chief justice of the territorial courts from 1871 to 1879. Joseph W. Fisher died in Cheyenne, Wyoming, on October 18, 1900 and was interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne.

He spent most of his adult life as pastor in the Holy Land. He is especially known for pastoring the Narkis Street Baptist Church in Jerusalem. His biography has recently been published under the name One Foot In Heaven: The Story of Bob Lindsey of Jerusalem. While rescuing an Arab orphan from the dangerous Israel- Jordan border in 1960 Lindsey was seriously injured after stepping on a land mine which resulted in the loss of his left foot. He was an Israeli New Testament scholar. He was a contributor to the Jerusalem Perspective, an academic journal of a consortium of Israeli scholars, including Jews, Christians, and others, of Jesus Research, the Quest for the Historical Jesus. Contributions to scholarship Lindsey is the author of A Hebrew Translation of The Gospel of Mark. The book is notable for its solution to the Synoptic Problem. He argues the existence of a Proto-Mark gospel (\\"Ur Markus\\"), which was a highly literal translation from an originally Hebrew source into Greek, which he calls the Proto-Narrative. The text of the Gospel of Luke is the most faithful to and best preserves this Proto-Narrative. Especially in the \\"minor agreements\\" between Matthew and Luke against Mark, it is evident that Mark deviates paraphrastically from the Proto-Narrative. Mark's paraphrases Graecize the text, including many phrases that are \\"non-Hebraic\\", being common in Greek but lacking an idiomatic counterpart in Hebrew. Luke knows this Mark- like Hebraic Proto-Narrative, but does not know the Gospel of Mark as we know it today.A Hebrew Translation of the Gospel of Mark: A Greek-Hebrew Diglot with English Introduction, Second Edition, Jerusalem: Dugit, 1973 While it is easy to show that Luke knows a Proto-Mark (which happens to be closer to Hebrew) and not Mark, Lindsey speculates further with more surprising conclusions, and argues for Lucan priority. Thus, the first gospel texts are in Hebrew. These were translated into Greek as the Proto-Narrative and the collection of sayings, often called Q. Luke knows PN and Q. Lindsey argues Mark knows both PN and Luke, as well as other New Testament documents, including Acts, James, and Paul's Colossians 1&2, Thessalonians 1&2, and Romans. Then Matthew knows both PN and Mark (but not Luke). Matthew is faithful to both PN and Mark and weaves their texts together, thus often agrees with Luke through PN against Mark. Despite the surprising claim that Mark depends partially on Luke, Lindsey emphasizes that his solution to the Synoptic Problem agrees substantially with the majority who hypothesize Marcan priority, since this Proto-Narrative is identical with \\"Ur-Markus\\", and that all three synoptic gospels - Luke, Mark, and Matthew - depend directly on the Proto-Narrative.

Career Upon his retirement from the U.S. Department of State in September 2014, Ambassador Williamson joined the faculty of the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University, where he is a Distinguished Professor of Practice. He serves concurrently as Senior Director for Global Rule of Law, Governance and Security at the university's McCain Institute for International Leadership, based in Washington, DC.McCain Institute; Biography of Clint Williamson In January 2017, Williamson was appointed as the Presiding Arbitrator of the Arbitral Tribunal for Dispute over the Inter-Entity Boundary in Brƒçko Area by International Court of Justice President Ronny Abraham, following the death of former Presiding Arbitrator Roberts Bishop Owen. In October 2011, he was appointed to serve as the European Union's Special Prosecutor, examining allegations of war crimes committed by Kosovo Albanians during and in the aftermath of the 1999 war in Kosovo. The most prominent charges involved allegations that individuals associated with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) murdered Serb prisoners for the purpose of harvesting and trafficking their bodily organs. As Special Prosecutor, he headed the multi-national EU Special Investigative Task Force (SITF) which has responsibility for conducting this investigation and bringing any prosecutions that are warranted.EU Special Investigative Task Force; Biography of Chief Prosecutor On 29 July 2014, in Brussels, he announced SITF's investigative findings. In this statement, he indicated that \\"certain senior officials of the former KLA bear responsibility for a campaign of persecution that was directed at the ethnic Serb, Roma, and other minority populations of Kosovo and toward fellow Kosovo Albanians whom they labeled as political opponents.\\" He went on to say that these acts of persecution effectively resulted in the ethnic cleansing of large portions of the Serb and Roma populations from Kosovo and that these crimes were not the acts of rogue individuals acting on their own accord, but rather that they were conducted in an organized fashion and were sanctioned by the KLA leadership. He added that the widespread or systematic nature of these crimes justifies a prosecution for crimes against humanity. As to the organ trafficking allegations, he said that \\"there are compelling indications that this practice did occur on a very limited scale and that a small number of individuals were killed for the purpose of extracting and trafficking their organs.\\" He stated that SITF's findings were largely consistent with those in the Marty Report, but that the investigation had not yet secured a level of evidence sufficient to charge those crimes. He concluded by saying that this aspect of the investigation is still ongoing, however, and that SITF will continue to vigorously pursue these allegations.Europa.eu>eu>tvnewsroom>event 29 July 2014 Immediately prior to his appointment with the EU, from June 2010 to September 2011, Ambassador Williamson served as a Special Expert to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, focused primarily on the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2010-10-27/remarks- extraordinary-chambers-courts-cambodia From his confirmation by the U.S. Senate in June 2006 until September 2009, he served as the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, with the rank of an Assistant Secretary of State.

Centered at the junction Main and South Streets with Academy Hill Road, it contains fine examples of Colonial, Federal, and Greek Revival architecture, including the 1839 town hall. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The town of Westminster was settled in 1737 and incorporated in 1759. Its early town center was located on a high point near the town's geographic center, now known as Academy Hill. That area included the town common, and was historically lined by houses and early civic buildings, including a church and a school house. None of the civic buildings have survived, leaving a collection of colonial and Federal period houses, to which the Colonial Revival Upton School was added in 1912. The town center migrated westward in the first half of the 19th century, when a turnpike (now Main Street) was opened, drawing first economic activity and then civic and religious buildings, while Academy Hill remained a desirable location for the town's upper class. The village reached its peak population around 1855, having grown as both a small industrial center and as a stage stop serving travelers. The town declined in economic importance after it was bypassed by the railroad. The historic district is roughly centered on the junction of Main and South Streets, extending west along Main Street roughly to Adams Street, and eastward along Academy Hill Road to its triangular junction with Dawley Street. The older Academy Hill area is near the eastern end of the district, while the later town center is along Main Street. Most of the Main Street buildings are Greek Revival in character, although there are examples of later Victorian and early 20th-century Colonial Revival styles. The Forbush Library, built in 1901, and the town hall (1829) are the major civic buildings in the center.

It includes the town's first cemetery, the First Congregational Church, and the oldest surviving house (c. 1752) in town, and only one building constructed after 1850. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history Land making up the town of Winchendon was granted to Massachusetts veterans of the 1690 Battle of Quebec from Ipswich, and was originally called Ipswich Canada. Early settlement did not take place until 1752, the same year the town common was laid out on the highest point in the town. Richard Day's house, probably built in 1752, still faces the common, and was considered the finest in the town at the time of its construction. Connected to other communities by a network of roads, the village did not grow significantly until after the French and Indian War, and the town was not incorporated until 1764. The village thrived in its early years, providing services to local farmers and to passing stagecoaches, but declined in the later 19th century, when economic activity and major transportation routes became focused in other areas of the town. The historic district is centered on a triangular common that remains from the original 1752 designation. It is located at the junction of five roads: High Street, Hale Street, Baldwinville Road, Teel Road, and Old County Road. It extends for short distances west on Hale Road and south on Old County Road, and a longer distance east on Teel Road to include the cemetery. The district's most prominent building is the 1850 First Congregational Church, but the common is faced by a number of fine Georgian and Federal houses.

The other individuals cited by Marber in this context are Giacomo DeFillippis of Giadefi, J. Player Crosby: of Finamex: and Martin Schubert of Eurinam. These four individuals were pioneers in trading emerging market debt (EMD). Robert P.

In 1803 the property was acquired by Ezra Wood, who built the main house. Wood was a prominent local citizen, serving on the town school committee and board of selectmen. He was also an early abolitionist, and it is believed the property housed fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. It was operated by the Woods as a hotel and stagecoach stop until 1844, and by Isaac Hall afterwards, until it was closed because the railroad rendered the stagecoach system obsolete. The property was purchased by Rev. Levi Warner before 1870, and remained in his family well into the 20th century. Warner's son Olin, who achieved note as a sculptor, eventually inherited the property, passing it on to his niece upon his death. The house was moved and reoriented on its lot in the 1980s due to road realignments, preserving the original 1759 ell and main block.

The park is surrounded by slightly higher ground and consists of a broad, often waterlogged, basin in which the water level fluctuates. The climate here is wet all year round, with an average rainfall of . About two thirds of the park consists of swamps dominated by mangroves and there is additionally some moist forest and coastal savanna. The park has potential for tourism. Flora Rhizophora racemosa The primary forest is dominated by Nauclea diderrichii, Berlinia occidentalis, Strombosia pustulata, Scottellia klaineana, Lovoa trichilioides, Gilbertiodendron preussii, Discoglypremna caloneura, Parinari excelsa, Guarea cedrata, Nesogordonia papaverifera, Erythrophleum ivorense, Tieghemella heckelii, Klainedoxa gabonensis, Lannea welwitschii and Heritiera utilis. The main trees present in the swamps are Rhizophora racemosa and Avicennia germinans, along with many palms including Phoenix reclinata, Borassus aethiopum and Raphia, as well as a variety of swamp vegetation including Echinochloa pyramidalis. The savanna areas are mostly covered with the grass Imperata cylindrica. Fauna There are elephants, chimpanzees and many species of monkey in the forests, as well as bushpigs and African forest buffalos. All three species of West African crocodile occur here, Crocodylus niloticus, Crocodylus palustris and Crocodylus cataphractus, but in low numbers and the African manatee occurs in the √âbri√© Lagoon. An attempt to increase the number of bay duikers in the park was unsuccessful because of predation by pythons. The park is an important habitat for wetland birds and was recognized as such when it became a Ramsar site in 2005. Some bird species of note include the cattle egret, the little egret, the grey heron, the black-crowned night heron and the peregrine falcon.

Born in Traverse City, Michigan, he showed musical talent at an early age and studied music at the University of Michigan. Sawyer conducted the University's Women's Glee Club and led the Bill Sawyer Orchestra, a big band that was featured on WMAQ's \\"Fitch Summer Bandwagon\\" on July 7, 1940.  Composing career  He composed several arrangements of choral works; popular songs for Perry Como, Fred Waring and Ray Eberle; music for the \\"Alaskan Stampede,\\" a Leo Seltzer produced \\"musical extravaganza on ice\\" c. 1944, and an opera based on Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer. He is best known for composing Symphony No. 1, known as the Alaskan Symphony, at Gypsy Trail, Carmel, New York in 1945. The work includes text from the \\"Spell of the Yukon\\" by Robert W. Service sung by a baritone soloist in the third movement, as well as other thematic inspirations drawn from his study of the climate, topography and history of the then-territory. The Alaskan Symphony was first performed in December 1945 by the American Symphony Orchestra and was broadcast across the United States and to overseas armed services at that time. Wilson Sawyer conducted the piece and Gov. Ernest Gruening of Alaska was guest speaker on the program. At Gruening's request, the original score was placed in the Alaskan Museum of Natural History [Alaska Historical Library and Museum] in Juneau, Alaska.  Later life  In 1960, Sawyer's wife Maxine was diagnosed with spinal cancer and they moved to Pawling, New York where he operated a chicken farm and laundromat. He continued to compose. The Alaskan Symphony was performed by the Hudson Valley Philharmonic in 1975 with Sawyer again conducting even though he had recently suffered a stroke. Sawyer revised the Symphony in 1977, making substantial cuts to the fourth movement among other edits. The revised Alaskan Symphony was premiered by the Juneau Symphony on June 14, 2008, conducted by music director Kyle Wiley Pickett.

Most of these are aquatic species, and in the dry season migratory species also visit the park. Resident species include the little grebe, African darter, reed cormorant, cattle egret, squacco heron, striated heron, western reef heron, black-crowned night heron, woolly-necked stork, and white-faced whistling duck. = Mammals = The park is also home to mammals typically inhabiting forest zones, such as duikers and bushpigs, as well as two species that give the park its uniqueness: one of these is the manatee, an aquatic mammal characteristic of the Ivorian lagoons; the other is the colony of straw-coloured fruit bats that roosts on Balouate Island, which the local people believe to be a sign of the presence of their ancestors. Additionally, there are a great variety of other bats, and the islands are home to the spotted-necked otter and the African clawless otter.  Human activity  The population bordering the park is divided between 21 villages and is officially estimated at 32,103 people, or 32% of the total population of the department. Tourism is the only occupation permitted on the islands, and fishing is the main activity outside the protected area.

It was established in 1968, and covers . However, it has lost nearly all its forest cover in the first two decades of the 21st century. Over the years, the park has been damaged and occupied by people and no longer provides suitable habitat for chimpanzees or many other large animals. History The park was established in 1968, having previously been a wildlife reserve, and covers . It had a great diversity of habitats including 60% dense forest, 15% secondary forest, 5% gallery forest and 17% of savannas interspersed by patches of woodland. By 1975, about 3% of the area had been taken over by cacao plantations and crops. Over the next few decades there has been much illegal logging and settling within the borders of the park, with the conversion of forest into agricultural land. No effective measures were taken to prevent these encroachments. By 2014, the primary forest was entirely gone and only a few remnants of the secondary forest (12%) and gallery forest (4%) remained. Of the remaining area, 15% was agricultural land and plantations, and the remainder was savanna with patches of trees. Description Marahou√© National Park is located in Sassandra-Marahou√© District in central Ivory Coast, to the west of the town of Bouafl√©. Part of the eastern boundary is formed by the Marahou√© River, a tributary of the Bandama River. The terrain consists of low hills and intervening valleys. The park is on the boundary between forested areas and wooded savanna and the habitats in the park include gallery forests, forest remnant patches, savannas with scattered trees, and wetlands around pools and watercourses. Flora In the gallery forests and the forest remnants trees such as Triplochiton scleroxylon, Celtis spp., Khaya grandifoliola, Erythrophleum ivorense and Terminalia superba are to be found. In the savanna woodland, Diospyros mespiliformis, Afzelia africana, Lophira lanceolata and Daniellia oliveri are more common. Fauna There are no longer any chimpanzees in Marahou√© National Park. This area used to be heavily forested but by 2009, it was reported that 93% of the forest had been lost in the previous six years. With the reduction in forest cover has gone a reduction in forest-dwelling mammals with the numbers of West African chimpanzee being reduced greatly. A 2007 survey indicated that there were fewer than 50 chimpanzees in the park, and by 2018, there were reported to be none. Other mammals recorded in the park are the western red colobus, the African bush elephant, the African buffalo, the bongo, the Maxwell's duiker, the red-flanked duiker, the yellow-backed duiker, the bay duiker, the kob, the waterbuck and the western hartebeest. Wildfires and poaching are serious issues such that the number of antelopes and primates are greatly reduced. Some 287 species of bird have been recorded in the park, some rarities being the emerald starling, the black-headed bee-eater and the yellow-footed honeyguide. A record for the white-breasted guineafowl awaits confirmation.

Description and history The Ahijah Wood House is located in southern Westminster, on the west side of Worcester Road (Massachusetts Route 140) near its junction with Honey Bee Lane. It is a two-story brick building, with the brick laid mainly in Flemish bond. It is covered by a mansard roof, an extremely unusual feature for its 1795 construction date. The main facade is five bays wide, with first- floor windows set in segmented-arch openings with small-paned transom windows above. The interior follows a central hall plan, with a straight run main staircase in the hall. The flanking parlors retain original corner fireplaces, and many rooms have period wood paneling. The two rooms on the north side of the second story are separated by a distinctive folding wall. Wood's father Nathan was the first colonial settler in what is today Westminster, arriving when Wood was a small child. Like his father, Wood was active in local politics, serving as town selectman. Ahijah Wood's son Aaron, who succeeded to the property, was a prominent local church member, temperance and anti-slavery activist, and politician. The property remained in the Wood family until 1902.

Forman. Plot introduction The story is set in 2000, twelve years after the world nuclear war known as \\"Doomsday.\\" A group of Oregon teenagers seek to use peaceful protest to stop militarists in San Diego from using the nuclear missiles on a captured nuclear submarine against Japan. Plot In 1988, an incident in Saudi Arabia touches off World War III between the United States and the Soviet Union. Things get out of hand and nuclear weapons are used; U.S. deaths number 120 million. The effects of EMP, ozone, and epidemics (California was dusted with anthrax) are depicted. Twelve years later people living in a rural Oregon have survived with their only contact with the outside world coming from Japanese merchants who have built a base near them. They are later, however, visited by representatives from San Diego, one of the few U.S. cities to survive the war. The visitors preach their plan to restore the United States by driving out the Japanese with a nuclear submarine that survived the war and ask for volunteers to join their army. Most people are not interested in their message but when the militants launch an attack on the Japanese merchant base it inspires a trek to San Diego led by a charismatic young girl to peacefully protest their actions. On the way they meet various groups of survivors: a gang of Hells Angels bikers who join up with them, monks living in a still functioning observatory, and refugees in the desert living in abandoned military vehicles. When they arrive in San Diego they find the city in ruins (the missile that was supposed to hit exploded in the ocean causing a tsunami that destroyed the city). They peacefully march into the base discovering that the militants were too afraid of their own soldiers to provide them with ammo and the nuclear submarine they boasted about had long since sunk to the ocean floor. Major themes Critics have compared the novel to Kim Stanley Robinson's The Wild Shore and have remarked on its pacifist theme.

Note the extreme offset to the driver's side, and the engine mounted outside of the frame rails. Supermodifieds are a class of open wheel race car that compete on paved short tracks throughout the United States of America and Canada. The class was founded in the 1950s and is especially popular in the Western states, the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. Design Supermodifieds are generally constructed from aircraft-quality .095 thick chromium-molybdenum (\\"chromoly\\") frame tubing with steel and aluminum components. The bodies are fabricated from fiberglass and aluminum. The cars are powered by American fuel-injected V8 engines that run on methanol fuel and can produce in excess of 800 horsepower. At a weight of around 1,850 pounds the cars achieve an enormous power-to-weight ratio. Big block V8 engines are also sanctioned and are primarily raced on the west coast, with nearly all competitors choose to run aluminum small blocks ranging from 410-430 cu. in., whereas the cars of the east run the mandatory cast iron big block with aluminum heads bored to the allowable maximum displacement of 468 cu. in. Cars in the midwest can run small blocks up to 412 cu. in. or big blocks up to 481 cu. in. Modern era supermodifieds run a radical offset chassis that is up to 18 in. to the left of center. The engine and driveline components themselves are mounted in a specially-fabricated area placed outside the left side frame rails. The engine is thus a stressed member of the chassis. This allows weight distribution to favor the left side (often as much as 70%) and thereby aid cornering around the left-hand turns of an oval track. The giant wings, (generally ' max), mounted on the roll cage of the cars bear a resemblance to those found on sprint cars and serve a similar purpose, designed to produce down force and allow them to make tight turns at high speed. The west coast style cars of ERA and SMRA run a fixed wing, whereas the cars of the east generally run a wing mounted to the suspension or chassis by pneumatic struts. The racing slick tires used on a supermodified are among the widest used in pavement oval racing. Like sprint cars, supermodifieds do not have starters, batteries, or transmissions and are push-started. The combination of high power, light weight, and high cornering ability allow supermodifieds to average over on a 1/2-mile oval and on a oval, with top speeds over . Sanctioning bodies There are currently four supermodified racing sanctioning bodies in North America. =ISMA= The largest of the four is the Liverpool, New York-based International Supermodified Association (ISMA). Founded in 1974 by multi-time Oswego Speedway champions Jim Shampine and Nolan Swift to ensure the future of supermodified racing. With the help of local businessman, Tom Heveron, they formed ISMA as a forum for owners and drivers to express their ideas and opinions as they felt that they were not allowed to do so under the management of Oswego Speedway. The goals were to upgrade supermodified racing with better safety conditions, more events per season to insure sufficient purses and to aid drivers with their race related problems. The association worked with track managements in making decisions and in discussing ways of improvement. The club encouraged new drivers and owners interested other tracks in supermodified racing and helped to make the division stronger and more well known to a wider audience. Tom Heveron as President, with the help of Vice President, Jim Shampine and Secretary/Treasurer Fred Graves, led ISMA through its developmental stages. ISMA negotiated with Lancaster for a 40 lap race held on July 3, 1974, which Todd Gibson of Richwood, OH won. The following year ISMA booked races at Fulton Speedway with a $5,000 purse and $1,000 to win. Starting in 1976, ISMA developed a point fund with tracks contributing $500‚Äì $1,000 per race to this fund. Unlike most other point systems, ISMA awards points to the car owners as ISMA is an owners club rather than drivers. Joining the Heveron, Shampine and Graves team, Shirley Letcher took over the responsibility for the point system. In just three seasons, ISMA had accomplished sanctioning over $96,000 in purse money and races, adding a point fund of $4,400 paid by promoters, having tow money at all of the ISMA sanctioned races, having insurance certificates from each promoter on file, and working with other promoters for more races in 1977. With races at Fulton (NY), Delaware (Ont. CAN), Star(NH), Flamboro(Ont. CAN), and Thompson(CT), Steve Gioia, Jr. became ISMA's first points Champion. ISMA continues to be at the forefront of supermodified sanctioning bodies, pioneering the franchise system, in which teams purchase a franchise at the beginning of the season. Creating a win-win situation for both the teams and promoters, each of the 19 franchise teams are allowed to miss up to 3 shows during the race season while being guaranteed a minimum starting purse of $1,000 at each event. This system helps to ensure solid, stable car counts and a successful event for the promoter. ISMA generally sanctions between 13-17 shows a year including two of the prestigious supermodified Triple Crown Series at 1/4-5/8 mile paved short tracks located in 6 states and Canada. Major events on the ISMA schedule include leg one of the supermodified 'Triple Crown' the Hy-Miler Supermodified Nationals, held annually at Sandusky (Ohio) Speedway since 1978, and leg three of the Triple Crown, the Star Classic 150 held at Star Speedway in Epping, NH for over 40 years. Races are also run at other tracks across the Northeast and Midwest, including Delaware Speedway in Ontario, Canada. The cars in this series use wings that are designed to move with the airflow over the car, lying almost level with the ground on straightaways creating less aerodynamic drag, and standing up in the turns to increase down force. The only allowable engine with ISMA is a cast iron big block up to 468 cu. in. Aluminum heads are allowed and the cars must weigh a mandatory post race. Notable ISMA competitors, past and present, include Russ Wood (eight championships), Chris Perley (six championships), Bentley Warren (four championships), Doug Heveron (four championships), Steve Gioia Jr. (four championships), Pat Abold (three championships), Joe Gosek (two championships) and Mike Ordway Sr. (two championships). As of the end of the 2019 season, the top five drivers for all-time ISMA feature wins are Chris Perley (74), Russ Wood (54), Bentley Warren (45), Mike Ordway Sr. (36) and Joe Gosek (30). =MSA= Established in 2001, the Sandusky, Ohio-based Midwest Supermodified Association (MSA) runs primarily in Ohio. MSA drivers frequently take part in ISMA races and vice versa. Notable MSA champions include Tim Jedrzejek (2002, 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2009), Trent Stephens (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014) and Dave Shullick Jr. (2005, 2006 and 2007). Dave Shullick Jr. has also won two ISMA championships (2015 and 2016) and one Oswego Speedway championship (2017). =SMRA= The SuperModified Racing Association (SMRA) governs supermodified racing in the Western United States. The SMRA grew from the defunct Western States Supermodified Racing League (WSSRL), which ran one season in 2007 at tracks in Arizona, California, Idaho, Utah and Washington before disbanding. Of these tracks, only Rocky Mountain Raceway in Utah and Madera Speedway in California have returned, with a third track, Magic Valley Speedway in Idaho, making up the 2008 SMRA schedule. The SMRA has a much more liberal rulebook than its eastern counterparts, with less restrictions on engine placement (rear-engined cars were universally banned in the 1980s) and allowing other such advancements as independent suspension. However, the SMRA ceased operations in early 2011 and no sanctioning currently exists in California. Nearly half the races scheduled for 2011 were cancelled due to a shortage of entries. =ERA= The oldest of the four currently-operating sanctioning bodies for supermodified racing is the Colorado-only Englewood Racing Association, which was formed in 1965 at Englewood Speedway. That track closed in 1979 and the series now runs a 9-race schedule, all of which are at Colorado National Speedway in Erie, Colorado.

The mutiny began on January 1, 1781, and ended with a negotiated settlement on January 8, 1781. The negotiated terms were finally concluded by January 29, 1781. The mutiny was the most successful and important insurrection of Continental Army soldiers during the American Revolutionary War.http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mutiny-of-the- pennsylvania-line During the winter, some of the mutinying soldiers also gathered food, supplies, and especially horses with the intention of traveling south to Philadelphia to march on Congress, which was then preparing to consider and ratify the Articles of Confederation, and to make their demands to Congress in person. However, there is no evidence that suggests that the soldiers intended to do physical harm or violence to any Congressman. When the mutiny broke out at Jockey Hollow, the Wick family estate, the soldiers famously tried to stop Tempe Wick, who was riding home to her sick mother on her horse Colonel. When the soldiers demanded that she surrender her horse, Tempe refused. When they again ordered her to dismount, she tricked the soldiers, and rode back to the Wick House, where she hid the horse. http://mentalfloss.com/article/63264/5-legends-americas-national-parks Although the mutineers were upset with Congress and with their officers, they ultimately refused to defect to the British when British Army General Sir Henry Clinton made them an offer. The mutiny lasted until the end of January when the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania opened negotiations with the leaders of the mutiny. When the negotiations proved satisfactory, many of the soldiers returned to fight for the Continental Army, and participated in future campaigns. This mutiny inspired a similar insurrection by the New Jersey Line known as the Pompton Mutiny, but this time the outcome was not as favorable to the soldiers, and the officers reestablished order over the army after they executed several New Jersey soldiers for treason.Yordy III, Charles S. The Pennsylvania Line Mutiny, its Origins, and Patriotism. August 8, 2005. Background During the winter of 1780-1781, the Continental Army was dispersed into smaller components to ease the strain of supply. The Pennsylvania Line, comprising about 2,400 men, was encamped at Jockey Hollow, New Jersey, near Morristown. Conditions for the army were deplorable, as reported in letters by both General George Washington, commander of the entire Continental Army, and General Anthony Wayne, commander of the Pennsylvania Line. In previous years, both Washington and Wayne had cited corruption and a lack of concern on the part of state governments and the Continental Congress in fostering the poor conditions. Pennsylvania troops had particular cause for discontent, as Pennsylvania was one of the stingiest states in paying its soldiers -- many of the Pennsylvania Line had served for three years in exchange for only their initial $20 bounty. Other states' troops were receiving enlistment bounties valued in hundreds of dollars (New Jersey recruits received a $1,000 bounty), and even new Pennsylvania recruits received large bounties while serving soldiers neither received regular pay nor reenlistment money. By January 1, 1781, the soldiers' dissatisfaction reached a boiling point. Many \\"three year men\\" reckoned that their enlistment terms, \\"for three years or the duration of the war\\", had ended with the coming of the new year. However, desperate to maintain the army's manpower, the Line's officers reckoned the enlistment terms to mean that soldiers were bound to serve for the duration of the war if it lasted more than three years. The Pennsylvania government would later admit that the widely accepted reckoning used by the soldiers was the correct one. Mutiny On January 1, 1781, the Pennsylvania Line held a raucous New Year's Day celebration. That evening, soldiers from several regiments armed themselves and prepared to depart the camp without permission. Officers led the remaining orderly regiments to quell the uprising, but after a few warning shots from the mutineers, the rest of the regiments fell into line with them. Captain Adam Bitting, commander of Company D, 4th Pennsylvania Regiment, was fatally shot by a mutineer who was trying to kill a lieutenant colonel. Otherwise, the uprising was relatively bloodless. General Wayne tried to convince the soldiers to return to order peacefully, but while the soldiers promised not to defect to the British, they would not be satisfied until Pennsylvania redressed their grievances. Wayne followed his troops and dispatched letters to Washington and the Pennsylvania government. The Line set up a temporary headquarters in the town of Princeton, New Jersey and selected a Board of Sergeants to speak for them, headed by Sergeant William Bouzar, who had previously served in the British Army. Continental and British negotiations On January 5, the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania learned of the mutiny and immediately dispatched Joseph Reed, the council's president, to resolve it. That same day, George Washington issued a circular letter to the Continental Congress and the governments of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, begging once again for material aid for the army, citing the soldiers' deplorable conditions that lend to the mutiny of the Pennsylvania Line. Reed spent the night of January 6 in Trenton where he met with delegates from the Continental Congress. Knowing the mutineers would have public sympathy on their side (including the Pennsylvania militia), the government had no choice but to negotiate. On January 7, Reed arrived in Princeton to meet the Board of Sergeants. Although General Anthony Wayne initially feared his men might not welcome Reed, on the contrary, Wayne and Reed were forced to dissuade the soldiers from honoring them with a cannon salute out of fear that it might alarm the locals. Also on January 7 John Mason, an emissary from General Sir Henry Clinton, British commander in New York City, arrived in Princeton. He was accompanied by James Ogden, a guide he had acquired in New Jersey. The agent brought a letter from Clinton offering the Pennsylvanians their back pay from British coffers if they gave up the rebel cause. Clinton had misjudged the nature of the Pennsylvanians' mutiny -- the sentries seized both the agent and his guide. Although the mutineers refused to turn Clinton's emissaries over immediately to Wayne and Reed, they showed good faith by informing them of the British offer and their refusal to accept it. Negotiations went quickly, as the soldiers distilled their grievances to one issue: that men enlisted in 1776 and 1777 for $20 bounties be discharged and then given the opportunity to reenlist for a new bounty if they wished. Reed heard testimony to the effect that officers had coerced soldiers to stay in the army or reenlist with unfavorable terms, even employing corporal punishment to that end. He found the testimony compelling and agreed to their terms, even allowing that the many soldiers whose enlistment papers were unavailable could simply swear an oath that they were \\"twenty dollar men\\" and be discharged. Aftermath Reed made arrangements in Trenton, where the Pennsylvanians marched to begin the discharge process on January 12. Approximately 1,250 infantrymen and 67 artillerymen were discharged. When the proceedings ended on January 29, only 1,150 out of 2,400 men remained in the Pennsylvania Line. However, many discharged men later reenlisted and the remaining regiments accepted their old officers.Boatner (1994), 764-765 In the aftermath of the mutiny, the Pennsylvania Line underwent a reorganization. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Pennsylvania Regiments were disbanded and their remaining soldiers reassigned to the senior units. The 1st Pennsylvania Regiment reorganized at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania under Colonel Daniel Brodhead IV. The 2nd also regrouped at Philadelphia under Colonel Walter Stewart. The 3rd was posted to Reading with Colonel Thomas Craig in command; the 4th under Colonel William Butler went to Carlisle; the 5th under Colonel Richard Butler went to York; and the 6th under Colonel Richard Humpton went to Lancaster. The rank and file, though not the sergeants and musicians, were all furloughed until 15 March. On that date the regiments reassembled at their respective towns. In May, Wayne led the 2nd, 5th, and 6th Pennsylvania south to join operations against the British in Virginia. The British agent Mason was tried and hanged as a spy.http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias- almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/mutiny-pennsylvania-line Controversially, Mason's civilian guide Ogden was also hanged as a spy.https://allthingsliberty.com/2014/01/mutiny-pennsylvania-line/ The Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George Washington, was not happy with the way the mutiny was dealt with. In a 2 February 1781 letter to Major General Nathanael Greene he stated: \\"[T]he affair of the Pennsylvania Line [was] compromised, by the intervention of the Civil Authority of the State: This (tho perhaps the only measure that could have been adopted in our circumstances) has been productive of ill consequences, by inducing other Troops to follow the same example‚ÄîI mean a part of the Jersey Line, who mutinied in the same manner on the 19th.\\" He is referring to the Pompton Mutiny in which Continental soldiers of the New Jersey Line, inspired by the success of their comrades of the Pennsylvania Line, attempted to achieve a similar success. Washington dealt with the Pompton mutiny quite differently: he immediately dispatched Major General Robert Howe from West Point to Pompton, where Howe \\"surrounded the Mutineers by surprize in their Quarters, reduced them to unconditional submission & executed two of their Instigators on the spot.\\" In popular culture One of Howard Fast's historical novels, The Proud and the Free (1950), tells this story from the enlisted man's point of view.Fast, Howard The Proud and the Free (1950) Additionally, Ann Rinaldi's historical fiction novel A Ride Into Morning includes the mutiny. The mutiny is depicted in ‚ÄúNightmare,‚Äù the 4th episode of Season 4 of AMC‚Äôs ‚ÄúTurn‚Äù.

Gogo Inc. is a holding company, operating through its two subsidiaries, Gogo LLC and Gogo Business Aviation Inc. (formerly Aircell Business Aviation Services LLC). According to Gogo, over 2,500 commercial aircraft and 6,600 business aircraft have been equipped with its onboard Wi-Fi services. The company is also the developer of 2Ku, the new in-flight satellite-based Wi-Fi technology.  History  Gogo began in 1991 in a barbecue restaurant in Denison, Texas, where company founder Jimmy Ray sketched his idea for an affordable telephone system for private airplanes on a paper napkin. John D. Goeken of MCI and Airfone had already invented an automated air-to-ground telephone system in the 1970s, and in 1989 founded In-Flight Phone Corporation as a competitor to GTE Airfone, serving many commercial airline passengers, but not supplying general aviation customers. Through a partnership with cellular providers, Gogo began as Aircell, providing analog-based voice communications on private aircraft in North America. By the late 1990s Gogo had leveraged a satellite-based system to offer voice communication on overseas flights. The next step was to devise a way to bring in-air connectivity to a larger market. In 2006, Gogo was awarded the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's exclusive Air-To-Ground (ATG) 3 GHz broadband frequency license. In 2008, Gogo made their debut on commercial aircraft. In June 2011, the company changed its name from Aircell to Gogo as part of a re-branding effort. Prior to the re-brand, Gogo's commercial air service was known as \\"Gogo Inflight Internet\\". In September 2014 Aircell rebranded as Gogo Business Aviation. On June 20, 2013 Gogo announced that it has priced its initial public offering of 11 million shares of common stock at $17 per share. Gogo started trading June 21, 2013 on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \\"GOGO\\". The price of its shares has fluctuated significantly since that time and the company has not had a profitable quarter in 2.5 years as a publicly traded stock. However, on November 16, 2015, the share price was approximately the same as it was when opening on June 23, 2013. The company has disclosed insider buying and selling activities to the Securities Exchange. \\"According to the information disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a Form 4 filing, the officer (EVP and GM, Bus. Aviation) of Gogo Inc., Wade John had sold 10,000 shares worth of $220,000 in a transaction dated April 16, 2015.\\" In June 2015, the company moved its commercial headquarters to 111 N. Canal St in downtown Chicago. As of August 3, 2016, Gogo had partnerships with 17 major commercial airlines and is installed on nearly 2,500 commercial aircraft and over 6,800 business aircraft. The company has over 1,000 employees. In addition to its Chicago headquarters, Gogo has facilities in Broomfield, CO, and various locations overseas.  Connectivity and performance  Gogo provides continuous coverage with minimal interruptions in speed, detected when passing from one cell tower signal to the next. Gogo's connection speed is approximately 500‚Äì600 kilobits per second for individual users for downloads and 300 kbit/s for uploadsInternet-a-Gogo: Airlines to Offer In-Flight Access The Wall Street Journal Total bandwidth for all users on the flight is approximately 3 Mbit/s. The Gogo service is compatible with any device that has Wi-Fi capability. External Aircraft Antenna Connection onboard can be similar (under optimal conditions) to the experience at Wi-Fi hotspots such as coffee shops and hotels in some but not all cases. Users report connectivity issues when streaming video such as YouTube and HBO-GO. Some users reported Speedtest.net benchmarks above 3 Mbit/s, while other users reported low results of 0.03 Mbit/s down and 0.27 up. In January 2015 David P. Reed reported that Gogo service exhibited multiple seconds of latency under load, due to bufferbloat. The user connects to the gogoinflight network and registers in the same way they would on the ground. The network becomes accessible as soon as electronic devices are approved for use after take-off. The service includes account management and allows purchasing service before the flight using the product web site. VoIP applications are prohibited by the terms of service. Technologies Below are the technologies that Gogo currently uses, has developed, or announced. Gogo ACPU-2 =Air-to-ground= Gogo's air-to-ground (ATG) network is a cellular (meaning that there is a hand-off when the aircraft moves between service areas) radio network that has more than 200 towers in the continental U.S., Alaska and Canada. The ground stations consist of original Airfone air-ground phone relay stations and newer locations, using the 850 MHz ATG band. Unlike terrestrial cell sites, ATG ground stations project a directional signal up into the air where airplanes are, rather than downward, where terrestrial users are. However the short wavelength used allows segmentation and other cellular technologies in the same way that terrestrial cellphone technology works. The aircraft communicates with the ground stations through an antenna installed on the underbelly of the fuselage. Equipment in the aircraft's avionics bay converts between proprietary Gogo protocols and standard Wi-Fi, which is distributed into the passenger cabin through multiple interior wireless access point nodes. = ATG-4 = Gogo's ATG-4 system is a backwards compatible improvement to the previous ATG system. Maximum total download bandwidth has increased from 3.1 Mbit/s to 9.8 Mbit/s. ATG-4 has been installed on at least 600 aircraft. Gogo can upgrade planes from ATG to ATG-4 overnight. ATG-4 is powered by EV-DO Rev B, one of the only production applications of the B-revision to EV-DO as part of the CDMA2000 standard. = Ku-band satellite = Gogo has satellite agreements in place with SES (for coverage over the U.S., Atlantic Ocean and Europe) and Intelsat (for coverage over portions of the Atlantic and northern Pacific oceans, as well as routes over South America, Asia, Africa and Australia). Gogo has also signed an agreement with Intelsat for satellite capacity specifically for coverage in the Atlantic and northern Pacific oceans, as well as routes over Central and South America, Asia, Australia and parts of Africa. Gogo announced in May 2012, that it will partner with satellite equipment provider, AeroSat, to bring a Ku-satellite solution to commercial airlines. A Ku-satellite solution will allow Gogo to offer airlines connectivity services that extend beyond the United States, including transoceanic routes, and will serve the needs of some of their airline partners in the near-term until Inmarsat's Global Xpress -satellite becomes available. Gogo's Ku-band satellite technology is used for Gogo's Ground to Orbit and 2Ku.  Gogo Ground to Orbit  Gogo Ground to Orbit uses a Ku- band satellite antenna for the downlink to the plane and Gogo's Air to Ground for uplink from the plane. Ground to Orbit will be in service over the United States and will have peak download speeds of 60 Mbit/s. Virgin America will be the launch partner of the new service. The Ku-band satellite antennas used for GTO are manufactured by ThinKom Solutions.  2Ku  2Ku, Gogo's newest technology, uses two Ku-band antennas, one for download and the other for upload. Gogo claims that 2Ku will have peak speeds of 70 Mbit/s and has a low- profile tall radome. Like Ground to Orbit, the Ku-band antennas are manufactured by ThinKom Solutions. Aerom√©xico is the first airline to commit to using 2Ku. Gogo is determined to expand markets for its 2Ku service. On November 13, 2015, the company demonstrated 2Ku for two dozen aviation and technology reporters aboard a Boeing 737. The system was able to stream high- definition videos. It was a small horde of ‚Äúdata-hungry journalists on board all trying to kill the system,‚Äù said Jason Rabinowitz, manager of data research for Routehappy, quoted in Bloomberg Business. Gogo claims that the service can provide speeds up to 70 megabits per second, with 100 Mbit/s to be available when satellite-beaming techniques are perfected. Actual speed is less impressive, as discussed in a TechTimes summary of some journalists' findings during the November 13, 2015 trials. \\"Speedtest rated it at 11.71 Mbit/s downloads, a 656-millisecond ping and uploads of 0.53 Mbit/s on my first try,\\" said Timothy J. Seppala from Engadget. He added that one drawback is the ping time, which varies between 500 and 1000 milliseconds. ... The Verge's Chris Welch, meanwhile, observed that upload speeds were almost nonexistent, but stressed that casual Internet users seldom need to upload anything larger than a picture or a Vine video anyway. As for streaming, it works brilliantly when [used by] only 18 people.\\" Total bandwidth on the media flight was capped at 25 Mbit/s. A Gogo press release in September 2015 stated that a Japan Airlines member, JTA, was then the most recent company to order 2Ku connectivity for its 737-800 aircraft. More recently, in a November 12, 2015 press release the company indicates that \\"... 8 airlines representing more than 550 aircraft have adopted the [2ku] technology for fleet deployment or a trial of the service.\\" More specifically, in addition to Aerom√©xico which already has 2Ku-equipped jets in the air, Virgin Airlines and Delta Airlines have confirmed orders for 2ku service, Gogo CEO Michael Small told Bloomberg Business. More than 1,200 aircraft are committed to receiving 2Ku. In February 2019, Alaska Airlines announced a rollout of the 2Ku service to their fleet, with a goal of half of their main fleet activated on the service by 2020. They claim 2Ku will allow passengers to stream online content. = Products = ;Gogo platform :Gogo's in-air platform gives travelers information, services, and entertainment while the airlines are able to display airline-specific information. ;Gogo Text and Talk :Gogo Text enables passengers can send and receive text messages from their mobile phones. Gogo Talk lets passengers make and receive voice calls. In September 2014, T-Mobile US announced a new agreement with Gogo to provide customers with free unlimited WiFi text and multimedia messaging while on board a Gogo WiFi-equipped flight from a U.S.-based airline. ;Gogo Vision :Gogo Vision streams movies and TV shows from an onboard server. In July 2014, Gogo launched Delta Studio with Delta Air Lines offering passengers a variety of television shows and movies that will be streamed wirelessly to passengers' own Wi-Fi enabled devices. ;Gogo TV :Gogo TV will enable airlines to deliver live television content to passengers own Wi-Fi enabled device. Channel options will be customized by the airline so it will allow passengers to watch popular networks in their country or region. The service currently will only be available to airlines that select Gogo's 2Ku technology. The first airline to commit to Gogo TV is Gol.  Participating airlines  As of 2019, Gogo can be found on Aerom√©xico, Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Delta Air Lines, GOL, Hainan Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, JTA, United Airlines, Vietnam Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia. In-flight entertainment partners include American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Air Canada, Aeromexico, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, JTA, GOL, Hainan Airlines, United Airlines and Scoot. When they were in business it was used by AirTran Airways, US Airways, and Virgin America. Historically, Gogo service began on American Airlines in July 2008. The first routes served were JFK to San Francisco, JFK to LAX, and JFK to Miami. As of 2010, they are expanding to include Gogo service on the full American Airlines domestic fleet. On August 5, 2008, Delta Air Lines announced it would install Gogo on all its domestic aircraft, which has since been completed.Delta Air Lines To Offer In-Flight Wi-Fi On All Domestic Flights (Official Press Release: August 5, 2008) A 2009 merger with Northwest Airlines added to the fleet. By early April 2010, 437 of 540 aircraft in the combined domestic fleet offered Wi-Fi, with remaining installations expected by summer 2010. Virgin America became the first airline with fleetwide in-flight Internet access, in March 2009. On July 14, 2009, AirTran Airways completed installation of Gogo on 136 of its aircraft.PROMISE DELIVERED: Airtran Completes Installation of Wi-Fi On All Aircraft AirTran Airways merged with Southwest Airlines in 2010. AirTran's Boeing 737s have been converted to Southwest's Row 44 in-flight Wi-Fi, and their Boeing 717s have been leased to Delta Air Lines and use Delta's Gogo service. October 2, 2009 saw the launch of Gogo on United Airlines' p.s. Flight 23 from New York to Los Angeles. The company installed Gogo on the entire United p.s. fleet before November 6, 2009. On November 20, 2009 Gogo announced that Air Canada began trials of the Gogo system on select Toronto- Los Angeles and Montreal-Los Angeles flights which occur in large part over the continental US. On February 24, 2010, Alaska Airlines announced that it will offer Gogo on its full fleet. The full fleet installation was completed in the fall of 2011. On March 29, 2010, US Airways announced that all its Airbus A321 fleet would offer Gogo by June 1, 2011. The full fleet installation was completed in the fall of 2011. On February 5, 2012 Frontier Airlines announced that it had equipped all of its Embraer E190 aircraft with Gogo to begin service on February 6, 2012. On June 8, 2012, Gogo announced that Delta Air Lines will begin offering in-flight Internet service on its long-haul international fleet of more than 150 aircraft, which includes Boeing 747, 767, 777, Airbus A330 and transoceanic Boeing 757 aircraft in early 2013. On June 20, 2012, Gogo announces that they have extended its contract with United Airlines to upgrade its p.s. fleet to Gogo's new ATG-4 connectivity service. On August 28, 2012, Gogo announced that Industry Canada has issued Gogo a subordinate license for Canada's ATG radio frequency spectrum that will allow Gogo to serve passengers on commercial and business aircraft flying over Canada. On January 11, 2013, Gogo announced that it will install two in-flight connectivity solutions to American Airlines' new Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 deliveries: Ku-band satellite and Gogo's next generation Air to Ground technology - ATG-4. On October 8, 2013, Gogo announced that Japan Airlines will begin offering in-flight Internet service on its domestic fleet of 77 aircraft, which includes Boeing 737, 767, 777, and 787 aircraft. On November 8, 2013 Gogo announced Gogo Text & Talk, an app that provides in-flight cell phone calls, and text messaging. As of 2013, the product was to be officially launched on commercial jets in 2014. On March 30, 2017, Gogo announced that Virgin Australia will begin offering in-flight Internet service on its fleet of Boeing 737‚Äì800, Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 aircraft.  Surveillance support  In April 2014, it was revealed through a U.S. Federal Communications Commission letter that Gogo partnered with government officials to voluntarily develop capabilities to share user data with law enforcement beyond what is required under the federal Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. In 2014, Adrienne Porter Felt, a Google security engineer, discovered during flight on a Gogo internet-equipped plane, that Gogo uses fake SSL authentication, carrying out \\"a man-in-the-middle attack on their users\\", to capture user activity. This deliberately fake authentication may be to enable law enforcement monitoring and also data mining of secure communications, and criticized the company for its use. The company was also criticized by Symantec for this issue. \\"Gogo has a legitimate interest in limiting or blocking video streaming, but the way they‚Äôve done it is far overreaching.\\" It is not known how long Gogo continued the strategy, but as a news site for the information security community indicated, the issuing of fake SSL Certificates has other risks for the user. \\"A cyber criminal ‚Äúacting‚Äù as Gogo could have performed many tasks without you ever realizing, such as blocking or censoring websites, capturing plain or encrypted data, installing malware, or even stealing passwords.\\"  Criticism of business model  It has been observed that Gogo practices a \\"roach motel\\" type business model that makes it easy to sign up for service via automated means but requires interaction with a customer service representative to effect an immediate cancellation. However, service for next and future months may be cancelled via email. By making it easy to begin paying for service but requiring a recurring monthly subscription, even when a shorter term of service may be desired, Gogo makes it likely for infrequent flyers to be billed in subsequent months for a service they do not intend to use. In addition Gogo does not send monthly statements, so customers are not alerted to the recurring charges. The service does offer 1-hour and 24-hour passes that do not incur a recurring charge; however, this does not change the fact that even those limited-time services are significantly harder to stop than to initiate. Gogo claims that to \\"cancel service is as easy as signing up for it\\" and directs subscribers to engage in online chat, send email or call via telephone. In contrast, however, the sign- up process does not require human interaction.  Class-action lawsuit  In 2013 Gogo was the subject of a class-action lawsuit, for allegedly not mentioning recurring charges on their website nor notifying customers that these recurring charges would be made. A New York federal judge, Jack Weinstein, ruled on April 8, 2015 that the suit (Berkson, et al. v. Gogo LLC, Case No. 14-CV-1199, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York) for claims that the company tricked consumers into signing up for automatic monthly renewal of Wi-Fi connections was allowed to move forward. In an 83-page memorandum and order of the case, the judge wrote, \\"the average internet user would not have been informed ‚Ä¶ that he was binding himself to a sign-in-wrap\\" and that the wrap contract \\"does not support the venue and arbitration clauses relied upon by defendants.\\"  See also  * Boingo Wireless * Connexion by Boeing * OnAir * Panasonic Avionics Corporation  References   External links  * Gogo Inc.

It forms part of the university's Department of Meteorology. The site at its current location has been a centre for atmospheric research since 1970, but the weather record was originally started by the University College of Reading (a precursor of the university) in 1901 at the London Road campus as a rainfall station with a near complete daily record from January 1908. Automatic meteorological observations are continually recorded at the site and available online  History  The first full meteorological observations from Reading were published in the Monthly Weather Report of the Meteorological Office in 1904. The site was at London Road on the best available position at the time, the Library Lawn. Records of barometric pressure, dry bulb, wet bulb, maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, cloud amount and form, wind direction and force and weather, both at time of observation and generally throughout the day were kept; the original notebooks are available from about 1910. Earth temperatures at 1 foot and 2 feet (later 4 feet) below the surface were also being made and grass minimum temperatures were added. Sunshine records started in 1956 when a Campbell Stokes sunshine recorder was put on the parapet of the Agricultural Botany building. The station was upgraded in the 1960s and the number of instruments increased, including a bare soil minimum thermometer, a cup counter anemometer and a Casella siphon rainfall recorder. A new Meteorological Site came into operation on January 1, 1968, located on the main University campus between the University boiler house and Wilderness Wood. New instruments were added including a ground level rain gauge and an inline Munro wind direction and speed recorder, the head of which was mounted on a 50 foot lattice tower and the recorder in a special hut near the Meteorological Enclosure. For a while sunshine records continued to be kept at the London Road site, but an excellent position was found on the roof of the new Chemistry Department building at Whiteknights, thanks to the help and enthusiasm of Professor Fowles, the then Head of Department. In 1969-70, due to the proposed development of the Wilderness Road site, a new Meteorological Enclosure had to be found. Late in 1969 a site was found on land east of the Whiteknights Lakes and adjoining Bridges Hall. A quick changeover took place to the new enclosure for records to start, unbroken, on January 1, 1970. Due to difficulties with the re-erection of the wind tower, it was some months before the Munro wind direction and speed measurements moved to the site's final location. The site was managed by various University departments, but was taken over by the Department of Meteorology in 1987, and merged with their small research site, established in the early 1970s. From 2008 the site became known as the Reading University Atmospheric Observatory, reflecting its wider range of uses at a time when new university development plans threatened its existence. = Staff = The earliest known meteorological observer was Mr James S Burgess, a technician in the Physics Department from 1918 until his retirement early in 1960. In 1955 he received a special Meteorological Office award for long service recording. Following Burgess's retirement, records briefly ceased (this gap was later filled with data from the Meteorological Office and Sutton‚Äôs Seed Trial Grounds), until the role was filled in May 1960 by Mr Arthur E Moon, retiring in 1977. At that point George Goodhind took over, who was employed by the Geography Department. Goodhind continued as Meteorological Observer until retirement in 1985, replaced by Ken Spiers who had joined the Geography Department in May 1982 as an assistant observer, moving to the Department of Meteorology as Meteorological Technician in 1987. Spiers retired in 2009 and was replaced by Mike Stroud, who retired in 2018. The site is now managed by the University's Technical Services.  Current use for research and teaching  Following the merger of the Meteorology Department's research site and the weather station in 1987, the site has been used since the 1990s for both research and teaching. In the early 1990s, a recording system based on Campbell data loggers was implemented for air temperature and surface fluxes. A display was provided in an entrance corridor of the Meteorology Department's old building, TOB2. This was known as CAWS (Corridor Automatic Weather Station). Some of the data obtained was also used for teaching in an ad hoc way. A more extensive and permanent system (CORRDISP, for Corridor display) was developed in 1996, with the entire site re-cabled and standardised connections implemented. A particular feature was the use of a radio clock receiving the long wave time signals from Rugby to provide time synchronisation for the measurements, which also ensured that the data receiving computer listened at the right time for the data transmissions from the field site computer, multi-tasking options being almost impossible to implement at that stage. The connection to the main Department building was implemented by both cable and VHF radio data links, the latter intended to prepare for the move of the Department to a new site in 1997. Ultimately, however, as part of work to prepare the campus for the new Meteorology Building, a trench was dug between the site and the building, carrying a set of cables and an optical fibre. CORRDISP provided five minute averages of weather observations displayed on a screen in the department foyer and online from 1996, one of the first sites to present data in this way. As well as the public data, the Observatory continues to provide micrometeorological data for practical classes and student research projects disseminated through an internal computer network, and high temporal resolution measurements of synoptic scale changes at 1 second resolution. Extensive research infrastructure for instrument development was established, particularly for micrometeorology, atmospheric electricity and around the use of meteorological radiosondes enhanced to provide more than the traditional thermodynamic quantities. Notable events detected at the Observatory include solar radiation and other meteorological effects of six partial solar eclipses from 1996-2015, with the most dramatic being the near-total eclipse on 11 August 1999. A video shows the observatory as it is today and describes some of the findings from research carried out there.

It is characterized by a large residential population living in the city centre with mixed-use developments, typically with a medium-height, commercial base and narrow, high-rise residential towers, significant reliance on mass public transit, creation and maintenance of green park spaces, and preserving view corridors.Boddy, Trevor 16.2, 2004, U.C. Berkeley journal \\"Places.\\" Vancouver has been repeatedly ranked among the most livable cities in the world. An article in San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association has taken note of Vancouver's approach to new development and view corridors and asks if San Francisco should pursue similar direction. Architect Bing Thom described Vancouverism this way: > It's a spirit about public space. I think Vancouverites are very, very proud > that we built a city that really has a tremendous amount of space on the > waterfront for people to recreate and to enjoy. At the same time, False > Creek and Coal Harbour were previously industrial lands that were very > polluted and desecrated. We've refreshed all of this with new development, > and people have access to the water and the views. So, to me, it's this idea > of having a lot people living very close together, mixing the uses. So, we > have apartments on top of stores. In Surrey we have a university on top of a > shopping centre. This mixing of uses reflects Vancouver in terms of our > culture and how we live together. An important aspect to note is that Vancouverism is an ideal that was developed in Vancouver but is not present in all regions of the city of Vancouver. Additionally, while outlying regions of Metro Vancouver, such as Surrey, have adopted aspects of these ideals, they did not originate outside the city of Vancouver. Vancouver's planning process has come under criticism for its unpredictability, lengthy approval process, lack of transparency, lack of public engagement, the repetitiveness of the built forms it produces, and the potential for the process to involve corruption. Background Vancouverism developed in part as a product of Vancouver's geographical context. Wedged between the sea, mountains and the border with the United States, the Greater Vancouver Regional District partnered with the area's municipalities to encourage controlled development. Early recognition that British Columbia's farmland would be engulfed by sprawl led to the establishment of the Agricultural Land Reserve in the 1970s. This assisted in containing and intensifying development throughout the Vancouver metropolitan area and the Fraser Valley. Architect Arthur Erickson is credited by some with developing the concept that became Vancouverism in the mid-1950s, in a never- realized development called \\"Project 56\\". Many of the principles were incorporated into the development of the West End. The city's planning department, under the direction of Ray Spaxman in the 1980s, began to expand on the concepts, many of which were brought into fruition with the development of the former Expo 86 lands along False Creek and Yaletown. Another person who is credited with influencing Vancouverism is Jane Jacobs, author of The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Brent Toderian, the former head of Planning for the City of Vancouver says of Jacobs: \\"There isn't a person or book more influential in creating 'Vancouverism' than Jane and The Death and Life\\"... \\"I know what she means about people misunderstanding density ‚Äì that's why we emphasize density done well rather than density as a mathematical exercise. [But] people 'round the world praise Vancouver's livability, and she had a big hand in it.\\"Wikens, Stephen (May 6, 2011). Jane Jacobs: Honoured in the breach. Globe and Mail Retrieved on: May 13, 2011 Aesthetics One principle associated with Vancouverism, as evidenced by planning policy, involves protecting \\"view corridors\\". Vancouver's \\"View Protection Guidelines\\" were approved in 1989 and amended in 1990, establishing height limits to protect views of the North Shore Mountains. This approach, while credited with preserving the city's scenic backdrop, has been criticized for lessening visual interest and failing to represent the city's contemporary image. In response, Council commissioned a \\"Skyline Study\\" in 1997 which concluded that Vancouver's skyline would benefit from the addition of a handful of buildings exceeding current height limits, to add visual interest to Vancouver's skyline. A study found that opportunities for such buildings were restricted due to a limited number of large development sites in the downtown. Eight years later, five of the seven sites identified for higher buildings had been planned or developed. The tallest of the new buildings is the Living Shangri- La hotel/residential tower, which was completed in 2008, and stands 201 metres (659 ft) tall (62 stories). The fine-meshed urban grid with mid-block lanes, has allowed the city to easily densify and promotes walkability. The overhead, visible, grade separated SkyTrain (Vancouver) transit system is an integral part of the aesthetic of Vancouverism, as it promotes a healthy lifestyle. Planning process One of the circumstances allowing the development of Vancouverism was the discretionary planning process implemented by the city. The planning process of Vancouver is based on collaboration by aligning the development goals of the city prior to determining the particular actions for individual drivers.RGS Goals and Strategies. Metrovancouver.org (July 29, 2011). Retrieved on 2014-04-12. Following the extended public outcry over a freeway and development program known as Project 200, Vancouver voted the Elector's Action Movement (TEAM) into power. TEAM ran on a platform of implementing more stringent design criteria and oversight to city developments. Development along South False Creek is the ideal urban form advocated by TEAM. The South False Creek development is characterized by low- density, mixed use and mixed-income residential properties with a high level of access to amenities. As well as favouring the urban form found along South False Creek, TEAM implemented significant reforms to the planning process. Discretionary planning allows the automatic approval of small developments that conform to the existing building codes. Larger projects are subject to the design review of the planning department. The planning department is empowered to make decisions that will force developments to conform to certain design guidelines. Sustainable development Sustainable development refers to solutions that not only benefit the present population, but also the future generations as well. This type of development requires looking at the consequences of decisions, which lead to solutions, and the consequences of those consequences too. Vancouver planners have been looking ahead of their current problems and solutions for decades. An example of this foresight can be seen in Vancouver's zoning regulations maintaining set-backs and sight- lines; and rejecting the downtown freeway, in which the city sacrificed initial gains for smaller long-term benefits and neighbourhood preservation‚Äîa trade-off that benefit current residents and later generations as well. Current issues revolve around finite energy sources and their impacts on the environment. These problems have led Vancouver to outline a growth strategy that considers the environment and community.  Criticism  Vancouver's planning process and Vancouverism have been widely criticized, including by prominent members of the planning and architectural communities in Vancouver, such as Patrick Condon, Scot Hein and Bing Thom, for a variety of reasons. Development potential on a site is typically divided into two categories, \\"outright\\" and \\"discretionary\\". Outright development is clearly defined in terms of use, height, and floor area and can proceed along a faster track than discretionary; however, the outright development potential is less than the discretionary track. Outright limitations may include lower height, less floor area, more restrictive uses, and larger setbacks. A developer can exceed the outright potential by negotiating with the Planning Department over the limitations on categories that have been identified in the various planning controls as \\"at the discretion of the Director of Planning\\". As noted above, this negotiating process gives the Planning Department significant leverage to negotiate design concessions or public benefits from developers; however, it does have numerous downsides, including: * Uncertainty about development potential and costs: The absence of up-front quantifiable values for height, floor area, use and setbacks in discretionary planning make it difficult for planners, developers, architects, residents or any others to predict or forecast accurately what can be built on any site in the city or what the development costs will be; * Lengthy planning approval: Arriving at a negotiated agreement for the development of a site ‚Äì usually performed as a custom rezoning arrangement called \\"spot rezoning\\", especially for a large site ‚Äì produces a significant amount of work for the developer, designer and planner; the excessive workload borne by the Planning Department on numerous such approvals at any given time causes delays in the issuing of permits for development. The City of Vancouver, as a result, has the longest wait times for permit approvals in the region. * Opacity of negotiation: The negotiations between planners and developers involve large amounts of money and affect the public, but lack transparency despite being negotiated by public servants on behalf of citizens; * Lack of public engagement: Because the discretionary negotiation takes place between the developer and the Planning Department, the public is not involved in the planning process until after those two parties have already agreed most of the major aspects of the development. This frequently results in significant public backlash at the required public open houses, with citizens believing that they were not adequately consulted in advance. Examples include neighbourhood plans such as those for Norquay, Marpole, Mount Pleasant, and northeast False Creek, as well as for individual projects such as the tower at Kingsway and East Broadway or the tower at 1725 Pendrell, among others; *Potential for corruption: The amount of money involved in real estate development, together with the discretionary power of planning officials and lack of transparency in negotiations, combines to create a system of development approval that can be highly prone to corruption and likely to involve dark or laundered money.

The British Virgin Islands has a total of 15 public primary schools and 4 secondary public schools. In addition to the public schools, there are 10 primary private schools and 3 secondary private schools. The School year is from September to June. The British Virgin Islands is a part of the British Overseas Territories and therefore the educational system is very similar to the traditional learning system in the United Kingdom. Primary schools are focused on establishing the basics of an academic curriculum and host students between the ages of 5 to 12. After the completion of primary school (seven years), students move on to secondary school (four years) and pre-university (two years). Secondary school is for students between the ages of 13 and 17. Following the completion of secondary education, students may write their Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate. There are approximately 2,700 students who attend primary school for the first 7 years of their required education; however less than 1,800 students successfully finish the following 4 required years of secondary school and complete their certificate exam [citation needed, incorrect, https://bvinews.com/87-percent-success-in-grade-12-top-school-named/]. Students who chose to continue their education after the secondary education certificate may move on to an additional 2 years of schooling (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations). Passing the exams entitles students the right to continue their studies even further at the University of the Virgin Islands. At the University, students can obtain associate, bachelors, and master's degrees in the departments of business, education, liberal arts and social sciences, or science and mathematic. Becoming Enrolled Students have the opportunity to apply to any school of their choice due to the lack of zoning. A student must apply for placement for both private and public institutions through the Department of Education. Applications are accepted between January and April for the following school year. Many documents must be submitted along with an application. Documents Needed for Enrollment: * child's birth certificate * updated immunization form * passport photo * letter of good health * transcripts from previous institutions (if applicable) * parent's passport * parent's work permit OR government appointment letter * if attending a private school, an acceptance letter Once documents are accepted and reviewed, prospective students may be asked to take a placement exam. Homeschooling Parents of student are required to submit an application to the Department of Education to achieve the right to homeschool their child. Student's are still required to take and pass examinations. Curriculums for homeschooled children may be just as if not more demanding than the curriculums and educational institutions. ICT Policies The Department of Education in the British Virgin Islands is improving schools greatly by resolving maintenance issues and increasing access along with use of ICT in both public primary and secondary schools. Teachers are expected to gain ICT skills in college and university education. The DOE requires that all Public primary schools have at least 1 lab room consisting of at least 10 computers per lab. In addition, each school must have an ADSL Internet connection. Educational institutions Tertiary: * H.

He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI. Life George Napper was a son of Edward Napper (died in 1558), sometime Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, by Anne, his second wife, daughter of John Peto, of Chesterton, Warwickshire, and niece of Cardinal William Peto. He entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, 5 January 1566, but was ejected in 1568 as a recusant. On 24 August 1579 he visited the English College at Reims, and by December 1580 he had been imprisoned. He was still in the Wood Street Counter, London, on 30 September 1588; but was freed in June 1589, on acknowledging the royal supremacy. He entered the English College, Douai in 1596, and was sent on the English mission in 1603. He appears to have lived with his brother William at Holywell. He was arrested at Kirtlington, four miles from Woodstock, very early in the morning of 19 July 1610, when he had on him a pyx containing two consecrated Hosts as well as a small reliquary. Brought before Sir Francis Eure at Upper Heyford (Wood says before a justice named Chamberlain) he was strictly searched; but the constable found only his breviary, his holy oils, and a needle case with thread and thimble. The next day he was sent to Oxford Castle, and indicted at the session soon after under 27 Eliz., c. 2 for being a priest. The possession of the oils was held to be conclusive and he was condemned, but reprieved. In gaol he reconciled a condemned felon named Falkner, and this was held to aggravate his crime, but as late as 2 November it was believed that he would have his sentence commuted to one of banishment. As he refused the oath of allegiance, he was condemned to death. He was executed between one and two in the afternoon, having said Mass that morning. His head according to Wood was set up on Tom Gateway; according to Richard Challoner's statement on Christ Church steeple. His quarters were placed on the four city gates, but at least some were secretly removed, and buried in the chapel (now a barn) of Sandford manor, formerly a preceptory of Knights Templar. Honours A plaque in his honour was unveiled at Oxford Castle on 23 October 2010.http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/streets/inscriptions/central/napier.html Blessed George Napier Roman Catholic School in Banbury is named after him.

He was in private practice in Miami, Florida from 1933 to 1965 and served in the United States Naval Reserve as a lieutenant commander from 1942 to 1945, during World War II.

While the wreck was found by Mel Fisher in international waters, the State of Florida confiscated the treasure claiming that it was found within the state's terrestrial waters. On August 21, 1978, Judge Mehrtens, upon remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, issued an opinion chastising the State of Florida's Division of Archives for using coercive backroom tactics to try and lay claim to treasure it knew it didn't belong to it. Ultimately, Judge Mehrtens granted summary judgment in Mel Fisher's favor, and the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed the majority of Mehrtens' ruling.

He was active in the Vend√©e department, primarily in the area around Les Sables-d'Olonne, and many of his buildings may still be seen in that area today. Durand was born in Les Sables d'Olonne, and began his career there in 1913, when he designed a number of buildings in town, including the Villa Mirasol and the Villa Blanche. He was accepted into the architectural academy in Paris in 1920; the following year he was named city architect in his hometown. In 1930 he was made the Architect of Historic Monuments for the Vend√©e department. He was awarded the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur in 1935, and became departmental architect in 1937. Before World War II, Durand was active in designing buildings around Les Sables d'Olonne; among the most notable were the Rudeli√®re casino, the church of Saint Peter, the \\"Notre-Dame de France\\" clinic, and a number of hotels. Some of his most important civic work was done after the war, in the aftermath of the Invasion of Normandy. German troops had destroyed many navigational aids along the French coast as part of their retreat in 1944, and many lighthouses had to be reconstructed in the decade after the war. Durand was charged with designing three: * √éle d'Yeu Lighthouse, completed in 1950 * Pointe des Corbeaux Lighthouse, completed in 1950 * Pointe du Grouin du Cou Lighthouse, completed in 1958 In addition, Durand was responsible for the design of L'Armend√®che Lighthouse, completed in 1968 as a landfall light for Les Sables d'Olonne. The four were built in an Art Deco style; notably, each tower was designed as a unique building, different from the others in the series. Durand was active throughout the 1950s and 1960s, continuing to design buildings for his hometown. He oversaw the renovation of the City Hall, the Grand Casino, the place du Tribunal, and the Caisse d‚Äô√âpargne, and participated in the restoration of the Abbey of Sainte-Croix. At the start of the 1970s, he was involved in one more restoration project, the work on the church of Saint Nicholas in La Chaume. Durand died in Les Sables-d‚ÄôOlonne in February 1978. Today a pavilion in the town is named in his memory.

The structure, designed by Maurice Durand, is the third serving the site; the original tower, constructed in 1830, was destroyed by German troops near the close of World War II.  Design  The first lighthouse at the site was a masonry building 108 feet tall; upon its destruction, it was replaced by a temporary tower while work was completed on a third light. This, the current tower, is a little taller, 125 feet tall, and was designed in the Art Deco style. Made of concrete and painted white, its lantern is black, while the base is built of grey stone. Several one-storey keeper's dwellings and other outbuildings serve the station.  History  = Before the lighthouse = The first lighthouse in 1935 For many years, sailors from Gascony had been clamoring for some sort of signal light to mark the √éle d'Yeu. The site was between the ranges of two lighthouses, those at La Baleine and at La Chaume, both of which showed a fixed light. In 1765, an engineer named Barbier attempted to place a lantern on the belfry of the Church of Saint-Sauveur; this attempt was unsuccessful, as was a later plan by the Chevalier des Isles, suggested in 1788, that called for the construction of a light tower at Petite-Foule on the island. Legend holds that the bell tower had at one time shown a light, but this is false. A new tower, 65 feet tall, was built on top of the church in 1774. Construction was supported by the state, according to the demands of the chambers of commerce of Nantes and Bordeaux, and the tower was to be used both as a landmark and as a watchtower. As it happened, the new tower was soon to be put to good use, and local sailors used it to watch British ship movements between 1776 and 1778. In 1811 the War Department isolated the tower from the rest of the church with the construction of an exterior staircase. Military use of the bell tower continued between 1804 and 1828; in the latter year the structure was returned to control of the commune, who refused to maintain it. In 1833, important repairs were carried out on the tower. Nevertheless, a pronouncement of 18 April 1836 found that it was not fair to force the commune to maintain the bell tower in its then-current state, given that it could be either removed or shortened without doing damage to the church itself. As it was eventually decided that the tower was of essential importance to the island, the state agreed to subsidize repairs, allotting 3000 gold francs for the purpose in 1837. Ten years later the same issue arose, and was dealt with in the same fashion. The old tower stood, being badly damaged in a 1952 storm, before being destroyed in a fire the following year; it was rebuilt in its former form in 1954. = First lighthouse = The first lighthouse on the site was formally opened on 15 October 1830; it showed a fixed white light from a first-order Fresnel lens. The tower was 108 feet tall, and cylindrical in shape. The lighthouse was electrified in 1895, at which time its characteristic was changed to show a white flash every five seconds. It was reinforced and fitted with a new lighting apparatus in 1912. This tower was destroyed by retreating German soldiers on 25 August 1944; it was quickly replaced with a temporary tower. = Present lighthouse = The current lighthouse stands on the heights of the island, just above its airport, and was first lit on 1 May 1950. Just like its predecessor, it shows a single flash every five seconds. This tower was automated in 1980. It is one of two lighthouses on the island designed by Durand; the other is that at the Pointe des Corbeaux, which was constructed in the same year.

Located at the extreme southwestern end of the island, it was constructed in 1950 to replace an earlier tower destroyed during World War II. Along with the √éle d'Yeu lighthouse, it is one of two lighthouses on the island to have been designed by Maurice Durand; construction of both was completed in the same year.  Design  The Pointe des Corbeaux Lighthouse is 62 feet tall, and is an octagonal prism concrete structure with lantern and gallery attached to one-storey keeper's dwelling. The tower and gallery are white, while the lantern is red. The lighthouse shows a series of three red flashes, in a two-one pattern, every fifteen seconds. Attached to the tower is a keeper's dwelling, which with several other annexes completes the station.  History  The first lighthouse on the point was lit on 1 September 1862. A small tourelle encased in masonry, it stood 38 feet tall, and was based on plans provided by the state. Its life was very uneventful; it was converted to different sorts of power on numerous occasions, at various times running on vegetable and mineral oil and gas vapor. This lighthouse lasted until being destroyed by retreating German troops on 25 August 1944. Reconstruction of the tower was completed in 1950 to Durand's design. This lighthouse was automated in 1990, and remains an active aid to navigation; it currently shows a halogen-powered signal. Today the lighthouse is controlled from the station at the √éle d'Yeu lighthouse; it can be seen both from land and from water, but cannot be visited by the public. Another, smaller aid to navigation, a post light attached to a short stone base, is also located on the point.

The lighthouse, constructed in 1953 to a design by Maurice Durand, replaces an earlier tower that was destroyed by retreating German troops during World War II.  Description  The lighthouse at Pointe du Grouin du Cou is a Art Deco tower built in concrete; it is octagonal, and has a lantern and gallery as well. The tower is white, while the lantern is painted black. Its focal plane is above sea level, and it shows a flash of light every five seconds; depending on the direction, the light shown is either white, red, or green. The signal is currently halogen powered.  History  The first lighthouse on the site was lit on 1 July 1831; it was a small cylindrical tourelle encased in masonry, and showed a fixed white light. A short tower, it stood only tall, and was intended to warn ships' captains off of the treacherous limestone rocks that could be found in the area. A taller light, tall, was installed in May 1867, and also showed a fixed white light. This was changed in 1893 to a light which flashed every five seconds, and which showed white and red sectors. In 1906 the signal was converted to gas power, and in 1931 it received a supplementary green sector. The lighthouse was also powered by other means at various points in its career, being converted at various times to mercury, vegetable oil, and mineral oil. The lighthouse at the point was completely demolished on the night of 24 July 1944 by German soldiers. A temporary wooden pylon was erected soon after, being lit on 10 October of the following year; the old lighthouse was not permanently replaced, however, until 1953. On 25 April of that year the new tower showed its light, an electric signal, for the first time; it was tended by a keeper until 1985, when it was automated. Today the lighthouse is controlled automatically from Les Sables-d'Olonne; its property is still owned by the government, and is off-limits to visitors.

QIA is also the largest investor in Glencore Plc. (8.2%), a mining company. = Barclays = Since 2008 dealings between Qatar Holding LLC and Barclays were investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for suspicious cash-raising practices during the global financial crisis. Allegedly, Barclays received ‚Ç¨7.5 billion ($8.2 billion) cash injection from QIA's subsidiary but did not inform its shareholders. Barclays was charged with failing to act with integrity and breaching disclosure rules for UK listed companies. Moreover, in 2011 both the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigated Barclays‚Äô ‚Ç¨2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) secret transaction with a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) from Qatar whose identity remains protected by the financial giant and FCA. In that case, Barclays failed to conduct \\"due skill, care, and diligence\\" at the base of Britain's anti-money laundering rules. As a result, the UK financial watchdog meted out a record ‚Ç¨92 million ($104 million) penalty against the financial giant. = Recent upsurge of Qatari investments in New York and D.C. = In early 2015, the QIA announced its intent to ‚Äúinvest $35 billion in the U.S. over the next five years‚Äù in various sectors of the economy. Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani, chief executive of QIA, told U.S. officials in December 2016 that it plans to invest $10 billion in infrastructure projects inside the U.S., although he specified no time frame. It is unclear whether this amount is intended to be part of the previously mentioned $35 billion, or if it is a new initiative.  New York  QIA has purchased $3.78 billion in Manhattan properties since 2014, including 111 West 33rd Street, 501 Seventh Avenue and 250 West 57th Street. QIA owns a 44% stake in its partnership with Brookfield Property Partners on a new mixed-use development delivering in 2019 that will include five separate buildings. In April 2015, the Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar purchased four apartment units for roughly $45 million at a development within the United Nations Plaza. In January 2014, the Qatari government bought a 20,500-square- foot townhouse for $100 million in Manhattan‚Äôs Upper East Side to be redeveloped into its consulate. From 2012-2013, Qatar‚Äôs prime minister at the time, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, purchased $285 million in apartments on Manhattan.  Washington, D.C.  QIA was one of the major financiers of a recent development known as CityCenterDC, as it invested $650 million into the project.  Controversies  = Campaigns =  Stop the Funding of Terrorism  In October 2014 the British newspaper Sunday Telegraph launched a two-month long campaign (\\"Stop the Funding of Terrorism\\") to stress Qatar's persistent negligence in countering terrorist finance and actively supporting terrorist entities and enterprises in the Middle East. The Telegraph's campaign included 34 articles published between 20 September and 16 November 2014, some of which accused Qatar of funding the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Middle East Eye remarked that Sunday Telegraph's campaign coincided with efforts by the newspaper owners, David and Frederick Barclay, battling for ownership of three five-star Mayfair hotels Claridge's, The Berkeley and The Connaught. Qatari royal Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani was the Barclay brothers‚Äô opponent, and he ultimately prevailed when in April 2015 the Qatar Investment Authority adjudicated the purchase of the three London hotels. The British newspaper has denied any allegation of editorial interference by David and Sir Frederick Barclay. Analogously, Qatar has denied the Telegraph's claims. Qatar stated that being a Muslim investment authority does not necessarily mean they support ISIL. However, shortly after, concerns on Qatar's alleged support to extremism and ISIL were voiced at a public event. During a March 2015 conference hosted by the United States Institute of Peace on the occasion of the official visit to the US of the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement leader, Tahir el-Faki, Qatar's alleged support of extremism was explored by representatives of the intel community who mentioned several reports suggesting that Sudanese President Omar al- Bashir was hosting ISIL training camps in Darfur supported by the Gulf country. An 11 February 2015 piece posted by Sudan quoted a Minni Minawi official denouncing Qatar's support to extremism in the country channeled through Qatar Charity, Qatar's largest NGO, and especially directed at \\"building housing complexes in remote and isolated areas to harbor and train extremist groups.\\"  Harrods boycott  London's department store Harrods faced a boycott campaign in October 2014 against QIA's subsidiary, Qatar Holding, which purchased Harrods in 2010. The initiative, led by London-based media lawyer Mark Lewis and extensively promoted by the Sunday Telegraph, intended to bring Qatar's role in terror finance to the public's attention. Mr Lewis was quoted by the Telegraph as saying: \\"We can stand back and do nothing, but when we do, we are paying for that terror ‚Ä¶ People need to know where their money is going.\\" The solicitor added that \\"the scale of its commercial holdings is such that most of us do not even realise that we are buying into its terrorist operations.\\" The campaign attracted public attention and was endorsed by a number of public figures in the UK.  The Qatar Awareness Coalition  On 27 October 2014 the Qatar Awareness Coalition (QAC), a group of high-profile individuals affiliated with American newspapers, platforms specialized on counterterrorism and private companies seeking to \\"raise awareness of Qatar and their activities around terror, genocide, and transnational organized crime - including slavery and narcotics\\", addressed a public letter to Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the founders of Miramax Films. As mentioned above, Miramax is largely owned by the Qatar Investment Authority; yet in December 2013, Miramax and the Weinstein Company signed a 20-year deal for future cooperation. The QAC signatories claimed that the deal \\"reunited the company with its founders\\", and thereby united \\"the Weinstein brothers, Miramax, and Qatar ‚Äì a prolific state sponsor of terrorism across North Africa and the Middle East ‚Äì in one corporate entity.\\" The purpose of the initiative was to sensitize Harvey and Bob Weinstein as well as the public to the \\"conflict of interest\\" supposedly occurring when \\"terrorist financing commingles with Hollywood.\\" = Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) = Qatar Investment Authority's affiliation with Qatar Islamic Bank (16.67%) raises concerns about the extent to which the sovereign wealth fund's may be or have been involved in some of the bank's disputable ‚Äì if not controversial ‚Äì activities. In a September 2015 piece, the Consortium Against Terrorist Finance (CATF) discussed the Sharia-compliant financial giant's correspondents and posited that several QIB's correspondents \\"have controversial histories of affiliation with or support of terrorist or extremist activities\\". Among the most concerning QIB's correspondents identified by CATF are: * Al Rajhi Bank, which became known to the public for the conspicuous financial support offered by some of its senior officers to al-Qaeda's terrorist cause for decades;9/11 Report.

The lighthouse was constructed in 1968 to a design by local architect Maurice Durand; unlike his other lighthouses, it was not meant to replace a tower which had been destroyed during World War II, but was instead built new as a landfall light. It was constructed in response to criticisms from local sailors, who said that due to development along the shoreline they could no longer see the harbor lights at the entrance to the town harbor.

History The original Parish of St. Mary's was established by Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick on Old Rutherford Avenue in 1828.\\"Our History\\", St. Mary St.-Catherine of Siena Parish In 1847, there was a revival of the anti- immigrant, anti-Catholic Know nothing sentiment and a mob gathered and stoned St. Mary's.St. Mary's Centennial Booklet, 1928 With the arrival of more immigrants, hostility increased. In 1853, a young Irish woman named Hannah Corcoran had become a Baptist. Her mother and a Catholic priest took her to Philadelphia. Nativist pamphleteers alleged kidnapping and murder and there was widespread public disorder. A Charlestown mobbed, inflamed by the handbills, came very close to storming the house of pastor Patrick F. Lyndon.Bennett, David Harry. The Party of Fear: From Nativist Movements to the New Right in American History, UNC Press Books, 1988, p. 90 Rev. William Byrne became pastor of St. Mary's in 1874; he became vicar general of the diocese in 1878 and served in both capacities until 1881 when he became president of Mount St. Mary College in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Om October 29, 1887 pastor John McMahon laid the cornerstone for the new St. Mary's on Warren St. He was the younger brother of Bishop Lawrence Stephen McMahon of the Diocese of Hartford, who was at that time overseeing the completion of St. Joseph's Cathedral, designed by Patrick Keely. Father McMahon chose Keely to design the new St. Mary's. The Gothic exterior combines Rockport granite with brick trim. The altar was likely designed by Thomas F.Houghton, Keely's son-in-law and principal draftsman. The Stations of the Cross are by Joseph Sibbel and duplicate those he supplied for St. Joseph's in Hartford.
