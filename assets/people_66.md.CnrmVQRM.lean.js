He is the tenth person to hold that position, serving between 2000‚Äì2007. Scouting career Selected in the spring of 2000 as Chief Scout Executive, Roy Williams began his career with the Boy Scouts of America as a district executive in Fort Worth, Texas. Following that, Williams served as district executive in Abilene, Texas, finance director in Little Rock, Arkansas, Scout Executive for the Jayhawk Area Council in Topeka, Kansas, and later the Narragansett Council in Providence, Rhode Island. He has also served as director of the Boy Scout Division, BSA National Council and most recently, Western region director. Williams' term as Chief Scout Executive was a very challenging time for the Boy Scouts of America. Shortly after Williams assumed the duties of Chief Scout Executive in 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its ruling in the Boy Scouts of America v. Dale case, where the right of the Boy Scouts to exclude known and avowed homosexuals from its membership was upheld. Although initially seen as a major win for the BSA, this decision led to funding issues with several United Way chapters, government entities and more limited recruiting access to schools. Membership in the BSA's traditional programs (Boy Scouting, Cub Scouting and Venturing) steadily declined during Williams' tenure. Several Councils, most notably the councils in Dallas, Texas, Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama were embroiled in charges of false membership claims. Williams announced his retirement on February 7, 2007, which was effective September 1, 2007. His successor, Robert J. Mazzuca, was named on May 22, 2007. Williams graduated in 1971 from the University of Texas at Arlington with a bachelor's degree in business administration. He is a veteran of the United States Air Force.

Conti was succeeded as Metropolitan Archbishop of Glasgow in September 2012, with the installation of Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, who was previously the Bishop of Paisley. Life Mario Joseph Conti was born on 20 March 1934, in Elgin, Moray, son of Louis Joseph Conti and Josephine Quintilia Conti (n√©e Panicali). He studied for the priesthood at The Scots College, Rome and was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Aberdeen in the Church of San Marcello al Corso, by Archbishop Luigi Traglia on 26 October 1958. After a period as Assistant Priest at St Mary's Cathedral in Aberdeen, Fr Conti served as parish priest of the most northerly Roman Catholic parish in the British mainland, St Joachim's and St Anne's (Wick and Thurso respectively) in Caithness from 1962 to 1977. He was appointed bishop of Aberdeen on 28 February 1977, succeeding Michael Foylan. He was consecrated to that post by Cardinal Gordon Gray on 3 May 1977. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity honoris causa by the University of Aberdeen in 1989, being the first Catholic priest to be so honoured since the Reformation. As bishop of Aberdeen he rejected claims that the Church sought to protect the interests of nuns and priests above those of children who said they had been abused. It followed the conviction of Sister Marie Docherty on four charges of cruelty towards girls at Nazareth House children's homes in Aberdeen and Midlothian in the 1960s and 1970s. The Liberal Democrats MP for Gordon, Malcolm Bruce, called on the church to apologise to Sister Marie's victims, but Conti resisted any public apology.BBC news online, 21 September 2000 Bishop Conti was translated to the archdiocese of Glasgow on 15 January 2002, succeeding Thomas Winning. He took possession of the archdiocese on 22 February 2002. Pope John Paul II bestowed the Pallium on Archbishop Conti on 29 June 2004, the Feast of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Archbishop Conti is a member of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. Conti was succeeded as Metropolitan Archbishop of Glasgow in September 2012, with the installation of Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, who was previously the Bishop of Paisley. Episcopate =Offices and awards= Archbishop Conti is President of the Commission for Christian Doctrine and Unity and also of the Heritage Commission of the Bishops‚Äô Conference of Scotland. The Archbishop is a member of the Catholic Bishops‚Äô Joint Committee for Bio-Ethics and also of the Central Council of ACTS (Action of Churches Together in Scotland) and is a President of CTBI (Churches Together in Britain and Ireland). He holds the following honours: Commendatore nell‚ÄôOrdine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana, 1981. Honorary D.D. (University of Aberdeen), 1989. Honorary D.D (University of Glasgow), 2010 Knight Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and a Knight of the Order of St John of Jerusalem Rhodes and Malta, 1991; Principal Chaplain to the British Association of the Order of Malta, 1995-2000. Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Honorary Professor of Theology at the University of Aberdeen, 2002 Grande Ufficiale della Stella della Solidarieta' Italiana =Restoration of St Andrew's Cathedral= Following a successful fund raising campaign Archbishop Conti oversaw the major renovation of St Andrew's Metropolitan Cathedral in Glasgow between 2009-2011. The ¬£5m programme was described as the most significant renovation of a Catholic church in Scotland since the reformation. The dramatic transformation was widely acclaimed and the opening was attended by Scotland's First Minister and representatives of other Christian denominations. The Cathedral now boasts new flooring, new heating and sound systems, new seating, new altar and ambo (designed by the Archbishop himself) and an iconic painting of St John Ogilvie by acclaimed Scottish painter Peter Howson.Peter Howson To the east of the Cathedral, thanks to a fund raising campaign among the Scots Italian community an Italian Cloister Garden has been created with a dramatic modern monument to recall the Arandora Star Arandora Star disaster in 1940. =Accusations against the BBC= In 2004, he accused the BBC of \\"rudeness and prejudice\\" in its coverage of the Roman Catholic Church and of \\"gross insensitivity\\" at the time of Pope John Paul II's silver jubilee. He said that the 25th anniversary of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II and the beatification of Mother Teresa had been marked with a documentary entitled Sex and the Holy City, which looked at the effectiveness of condoms in the fight against AIDS. He also questioned the plans to broadcast a cartoon called Popetown, which satirised the Pope as a childish pensioner and he accused Newsnight Scotland of conducting a \\"sneering and aggressive\\" interview on the church's position on shared campus schools. The National Secular Society described the claims as \\"grossly anti-democratic and dangerous\\". A spokesperson for the BBC said: \\"We are always keen to ensure that all faiths are reflected across our output and are reported accurately.\\" =Human cloning= In 2003, Conti publicly accused the UK Government of paving the way for human cloning. He claimed the first step on the \\"nightmarish journey\\" had been the acceptance of test tube babies or invitro fertilisation (IVF) in 1978. =Gay rights= Archbishop Conti has been a vociferous opponent of extensions to gay rights. In 2000, he signed a public letter alongside Cardinal Winning which called for the retention of Section 28 of the Local Government Act despite efforts by the government to repeal. The letter argued that it was important to prevent the funding and promotion of educational material overtly promoting homosexual practice in schools.BBC news online, 19 January 2000 In 2006 Conti publicly voiced his views on the case of nine Scottish firefighters who had been disciplined for refusing to take part in a gay pride event, saying it was wrong to expect them to participate. Not because homosexual people should not be given fire safety advice, but because the men felt uncomfortable about the 'kiss-a-fireman' campaign allegedly planned for the event.Personnel Today, 12 September 2006 Also in 2006, Conti called on MSPs to reject the Civil Partnerships (Scotland) Bill, which would provide unmarried couples in \\"committed\\" relationships with equality in areas like inheritance, pensions and bereavement saying, \\"It is not homophobia and we have no gripe against homosexuals per se but we believe that the homosexual relationship is subversive.\\" He later criticised government proposals to permit the adoption of children by gay couples. Later that same year he preached a sermon which put forward the view that the moral teaching of the Church was being undermined. In part of the sermon, he criticized the UK's civil partnerships legislation which had recently been introduced. He also mentioned the Catholic Church's traditional teaching, stating that homosexual acts cannot be considered equivalent to marital love between a man and a woman. After Patrick Harvie (a Green MSP and advocate of LGBT equality) heard about the Archbishop's sermon, he wrote to the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police asking for the Force to give clarity regarding the criteria for using breach of the peace charges in relation to comments which might be seen to incite hatred on grounds of sexual orientation.http://www.tomharris.org.uk/tag/archbishop-mario-conti/ More recently, in October 2010 he sent a public letter to all Scottish parishes urging Catholic parishioners to oppose Government plans to give gay couples the right to marry.Pink News, 10 October 2011 He warned that the move would create \\"larger divisions\\" in society. This prompted the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie to suggest that the Catholic Church was trying to control opinion.BBC news online, 10 October 2011 =Lockerbie bomber= In 2009, Conti was vocal in supporting the release by the Scottish government of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, who had been imprisoned for his part in the Lockerbie bombing.BBC News Website, 24 August 2009 Conti argued that, \\"I personally, and many others in the Catholic community, admired the decision to release Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi on grounds of compassion which is, after all, one of the principles inscribed on the mace of the Scottish Parliament by which Scotland's government should operate.\\" =Sexual health= In 2004, Conti criticised Scottish Executive proposals to tackle sexual health problems among young people. He argued that the draft strategy placed too much emphasis on medical treatment and not enough on spiritual or social worries. Concern over homosexuality being perceived as equal to heterosexual relationships and the absence of references to marriage in the report were also highlighted by the archbishop.BBC online news, 1 March 2004 =Summorum Pontificum= In 2007 he issued directives on the application of the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum in his diocese. This clarified arrangements for priests who wished to freely celebrate in Glasgow the Mass according to the 1962 Roman Missal (the Tridentine Mass). Father John Zuhlsdorf said they were directly disobedient to Benedict XVI's motu proprio, which allowed complete freedom for celebrating this form of Mass without a congregation but demanded certain conditions for its celebration with a congregation. =Support for asylum seekers= In 2012 he launched an outspoken defence of asylum seekers facing destitution. The Archbishop wrote an article urging action to defend the asylum seekers at risk (Sunday Herald 10 June 2012) and backed a public demonstration to protest at the asylum seekers' eviction: \\"It seems utterly inconceivable that a country with such strong traditions of welfare provision, fairness and social cohesion could allow innocent persons to be evicted, banned from working, left without food and shelter, and effectively eliminated from society. But that is exactly what is likely to happen ‚Äì unless something is done.\\" External links *Biographical link *Sectarianism 'caused by poverty' says archbishop References Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:People from Elgin, Moray Category:Scottish people of Italian descent Category:Bishops of Aberdeen Category:Archbishops of Glasgow Category:Post-Reformation Roman Catholic bishops in Scotland Category:Scottish Roman Catholic bishops Category:Scottish Roman Catholic priests Category:Knights of Malta Category:Knights of the Holy Sepulchre ","title":"Mario Conti"},{"id":"3031009","text":"John Aubrey Clarendon Latham, (23 February 1921 - 1 January 2006) was a Northern Rhodesian-born British conceptual artist. Life and work Film Star, 1960, Tate Modern Latham was born in Northern Rhodesia to the cricketer and colonial administrator Geoffrey Latham. He was educated in England at Winchester College. In the Second World War he commanded a motor torpedo boat in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the war he studied art, first at the Regent Street Polytechnic and then at the Chelsea College of Art and Design. He married fellow artist and collaborator Barbara Steveni in Westminster in 1951. The spray can became Latham's primary medium, as can be seen in Man Caught Up with a Yellow Object (oil painting, 1954) in the Tate Gallery collection. In addition to spray paint, Latham tore, sawed, chewed and burnt books to create collage material for his work, such as Film Star (1960). Latham's event-based art was influential in performance art. In 1966, he took part in the Destruction in Art Symposium in London led by Gustav Metzger along with Fluxus artists such as Yoko Ono, Wolf Vostell and Al Hansen.Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS), London, 1966. His \\"skoob\\" (\\"books\\" written backwards) works using books or materials derived from them had the power to shock. He moved from collages to towers of books which he then burnt, awakening uncomfortable echoes of the Nazi regime's public burning of banned books. From 1983 Latham lived and worked at his house, Flat Time HouseFlat Time House in Peckham. In 1991 he produced God is Great (no. 2), a conceptual artwork featuring copies of the Bible, Quran, and a volume of the Talmud, each cut in two and attached to a sheet of glass. In 2005 Tate Britain held an exhibition of Latham's work. Latham died at Kings College Hospital, Camberwell, on 1 January 2006. In 2010 John Latham: Canvas Events was published by Ridinghouse. In 2016 the Henry Moore Institute presented A Lesson in Sculpture with John Latham, an exhibition addressing Latham's visionary contribution to the study of sculpture, bringing sixteen works by Latham, spanning 1958 to 2005, into conversation with sixteen sculptures by artists working across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Like Latham, members of the rock band Pink Floyd attended Regent Street Polytechnic. In 2016 Pink Floyd released their collection of rare and unreleased recorded early material in the box set The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972. On the second CD of the collection is an extended instrumental improvisation, similar to that of the middle section of their performances of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", which were recorded in 1967 as a soundtrack for Latham's 1962 film Speak.https://www.thewire.co.uk/in- writing/essays/david-toop-listens-finally-to-the-john-latham-recordings-of- pink-floydhttps://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/05/john-latham-a- world-view-serpentine-gallery-speak-bruguera-gordon-prouvost-spooner The piece is split across nine tracks on the CD.

His major results from this period: 16th Western Open, Excelsior, Minnesota 1915‚Äì8.5/10, second place, winner Jackson Showalter; 17th Western Open, Chicago 1916‚Äì13.5/19, tied 4-5th, winner Edward Lasker.chessgames / phonybenoni games collection By 1918, he was one of the strongest players in the country, defeating former U.S. champion Showalter in a match, by a score of +4 -1 =3. This was actually the second match between the two: Showalter had dominated their contest in 1916 by +6 -1 =0.Denker and Parr, p. 271. Whitaker with John H. Smythe Jr In 1920, Whitaker represented Washington, D.C. against Chicago in what is believed to have been the first American shortwave radio long-distance chess match. He faced the very experienced master Edward Lasker. A pre-arranged time limit of three hours for the game found it still unfinished after 25 moves, with Whitaker having a slight advantage, and Capablanca adjudicated the position as a win for Whitaker.chessgames.com, games collection of Norman Whitaker; see Whitaker vs. Edward Lasker, 1920 =Peak performance= In 1921, at Atlantic City, he placed clear second, and top American, in the Eighth American Chess Congress. This series of nine tournaments, staged at irregular intervals between 1857 and 1923, was the forerunner to the modern United States Chess Championship tournament series. Whitaker finished with 8/11, only half a point behind winner Janowski, and ahead of Marshall, both of whom he defeated head-to-head. This was arguably his peak lifetime performance.Denker and Parr, p. 263 Whitaker was then scheduled to play a match against Marshall for the U.S. Chess Championship, but did not show up.Shady Side: The Life and Times of Norman Tweed Whitaker, Chess Master, by John Samuel Hilbert, 2000, Caissa Editions, He had been arrested and criminally charged in November 1921 (see below), and this was the likely reason for cancellation of the match.Denker and Parr, p. 266. =Wins Western Open= Whitaker was a regular challenger for top places in the Western Open, held annually in the midwest, south, or far west. In 1921, at Cleveland (22nd Western), he placed fourth with 8/11; Edward Lasker won with 9.5. In 1922, at Louisville (23rd Western), he placed clear second with 9/11, half a point behind champion Samuel Factor. He tied with Stasch Mlotkowski for the title in 1923 at San Francisco (24th Western) with 9/11. At Detroit 1924 (25th Western), he tied 2nd-4th with 11.5/16, but a young Mexican Carlos Torre Repetto dominated with 14. =Represents U.S. in international chess= In 1927, following release from prison, he won a nine- player invitational round-robin event, which was the first National Chess Federation Congress, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, ahead of the teenaged Samuel Reshevsky, who was already Master strength, and who later became one of the world's top players. Based on this result, with 6.5/8 -- Whitaker was declared champion of the NCF, a predecessor of the United States Chess Federation (USCF).Hilbert; chessgames.com, phonybenoni tournament crosstables files However, despite winning this title, Whitaker was not even invited to participate in the championship the following year, held at Bradley Beach, New Jersey; this situation indicates conflict with chess administrators, likely over his criminal past. In 1928, while on his honeymoon, Whitaker went to The Hague to represent the United States in the Amateur World Championship, a round-robin tournament, against the champions of 15 other nations. Also being staged at the same time and site was the 2nd Chess Olympiad for international teams. Despite being in a terrible train wreck which killed nine people and severely injured his wife, he finished with a solid score of 9.5/14 in his first strong international event outside the U.S.; this tied for 4th-6th places, and won a prize. The tournament champion was Max Euwe, who became World Chess Champion seven years later. In 1929 at St. Louis (30th Western), Whitaker defeated the eventual champion, Chicago Master Herman Hahlbohm, but trailed him by half a point with 7.5/10, tied 2nd-4th. Whitaker tied for the title in 1930 at Chicago (31st Western) with Samuel Factor with 6.5/8. In 1930, Whitaker represented Washington, D.C. against London in a transatlantic radio match, losing a spectacular tactical game to former British champion Sir George Thomas, 7th Baronet.chessgames.com, games collection of Norman Whitaker; see Whitaker vs. Thomas, 1930 This game was later selected for the classic, highly regarded 1952 best games book: 500 Master Games of Chess, by Savielly Tartakower and Julius du Mont. =Selection dispute= Whitaker became embroiled in a dispute with chess administrators during the early 1930s. He believed he should have been selected into the American team for the 3rd Chess Olympiad, Hamburg 1930 (instead of Harold Meyer Phillips (0.5/2 at Hamburg) or James Allan Anderson (6/17)), or for the 4th Chess Olympiad, Prague 1931.olimpbase.org, Hamburg 1930 Olympiad final group crosstable, U.S. team detailed results Based on prior competitive results, and on the weak showings by Phillips and Anderson on an otherwise well-performing American team (6th place) at Hamburg, Whitaker may have had a reasonable case. But it is likely that his criminal past (see below) was also a factor in the decision. He went so far as to directly contact FIDE President Alexander Rueb, suggesting that two American affiliate chess organizations be permitted as members of FIDE, allowing two American teams, while other nations had only one, but his argument was dismissed. This approach by an individual to the FIDE President over a national team selection matter was unlikely to win any friends for Whitaker. While seemingly frivolous, questions over which players were best qualified to play on the team did lead American chess administrators to stage a qualifying tournament among Masters, to select the national team for the 1933 Olympiad.Denker and Parr By that time, Whitaker was facing serious criminal charges (see below); he was never selected to future teams. American teams without Whitaker were able to claim the Olympiad team gold medals for 1931, 1933, 1935 and 1937, along with many individual medals.olimpbase.org, final group standings for Prague 1931, Folkestone 1933, Warsaw 1935 and Stockholm 1937 Olympiads By 1939, the Western Chess Association and the National Chess Federation had merged into the United States Chess Federation. Professional career Whitaker was practicing law in Washington, D.C. by 1916. He worked for several years as a civil servant for the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as a patent attorney. He avoided military service during World War I by travelling around the country, staying ahead of recruiting notices, before finally reporting as the war wound down in November 1918, then being discharged after one day, for defective vision. Criminal involvement, conviction, prison However, Whitaker was disbarred in 1924 from the practice of law. Whitaker conspired with several of his own family members in an elaborate auto theft / insurance fraud scheme in the early 1920s. Whitaker, together with brother Roland and sisters Dorothy and Hazel Whitaker, was arrested in November 1921 for violating the Dyer Act, which had been passed with the aim of preventing the transportation of stolen automobiles across state lines. It was \\"a nationwide plot to recover insurance on automobiles claimed to have been stolen and transported from one state to another.\\"The New York Times, February 26, 1922; Denker and Parr, p. 266 After exhausting more than three years of delays and appeals in 1925, Whitaker served two years in United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth. Lindbergh case, return to prison, criminal schemes Norman T. Whitaker, mug shot, 1932 In March and April 1932, Whitaker gained what eventually became national notoriety during the Lindbergh kidnapping, which saw famed aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant child kidnapped from his New Jersey estate. Whitaker, out on bail after a Florida arrest for a scheme similar to his earlier auto fraud conviction, fled that jurisdiction and headed north, to conspire with former United States Department of Justice Agent Gaston Means, who had been a bagman for bribes during the corrupt Harding administration.Denker and Parr, p. 265-268 The two concocted a scheme to swindle a wealthy but gullible heiress, Evalyn Walsh McLean, co-publisher of The Washington Post, by claiming to be in contact with the kidnappers, and convinced her that they could arrange for the baby's safe return. Means intended to use Whitaker, who posed as a gangster, as the bagman to pick up her ransom money, but both were arrested and eventually convicted. What Whitaker was really convicted of was \\"attempted\\" extortion.Hilbert, p. 121; Denker and Parr, pp. 265-268 Means, without Whitaker's help, had earlier swindled Mrs. McLean out of $104,000, before enlisting Whitaker for a second con with a similar theme. Whitaker claimed that the Lindbergh kidnappers had refused $49,500 of the ransom money paid by Mrs. McLean because the serial numbers on the money had been published. Therefore, he demanded replacement money from her, in the amount of $35,000, in exchange for which he promised to return the original $49,500, plus the baby. She did not pay the second amount; that was when the Federal Bureau of Investigation was finally called in.Hilbert; Denker and Parr, pp. 265-268 The baby was found dead by father Charles Lindbergh in May 1932, two months after it had been kidnapped. Whitaker claimed in his 1933 trial in the capital, which became a national media frenzy, that he never got any of the money and, when asked what happened to the money, Whitaker replied, \\"I do not know and I wish I did.\\".Denker and Parr, p. 268 Means was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the initial successful swindle and attempted reprise, and died in prison. Whitaker was released after serving just 18 months, but was soon arrested again. During his life, he served time at several prisons, including Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, where he befriended the notorious Al Capone. They had a falling-out in 1936 when Capone refused to join in Whitaker's prison strike, but reconciled later on. Whitaker was skillful at resetting car odometers with a screwdriver. He supplemented his income with this and other confidence tricks. He practiced several confidence schemes, among them impersonation and elaborate false arrest. His advanced education, high intelligence, command of foreign languages, expensive wardrobe, plentiful ready cash, skill at chess, and confident personal manner all aided in fooling many unsuspecting victims.Denker and Parr, p.262-268 During his life, Whitaker was convicted of several additional serious offenses, including sending morphine through the mail, and sexual molestation of a minor (1950).Hilbert; Denker and Parr, p. 269 Returns to chess After his parole, and between his various prison terms, Whitaker became once again a tournament chess player, and for several years was one of the most active competitive players in America and Europe. Games databases which compile competitive events indicate a 16-year gap for Whitaker from 1931 to 1947; he played the 1947 U.S. Open, at Corpus Christi, Texas in his return.chessgames.com, the Norman Whitaker games collection However, he qualified through a strong preliminary event into the 1948 U.S. Championship, his first. In the finals, Whitaker could only manage to finish 16th out of 20, in South Fallsburg, New York; he was in his late fifties by this time. The winner was Herman Steiner, and most of the competitors were far younger than Whitaker. Whitaker played four more U.S. Opens, with very respectable results; by this era, the event was run under the Swiss-system tournament format, with much larger fields. At Baltimore 1948, he scored 6/12 for a tied 34th-41st; the winner was Weaver W. Adams. At Fort Worth 1951, he scored 8/12 for a tied 9-13th; Larry Evans won. At Milwaukee 1953, he scored 7.5/12 for a tied 43-55th; the champion was Donald Byrne. And finally at New Orleans 1954, he scored 7.5/12 for a tied 17-23rd; Evans and Arturo Pomar Salamanca shared the title. Whitaker also served as a chess organizer and tournament director during this period, to supplement his income; for example, he directed the 1957 Eastern Open tournament. He also travelled in 1956 with the New Jersey-based Log Cabin Chess Club to Cuba, playing first board for the team, ahead of 13-year-old Bobby Fischer, who was on second board. Whitaker drew a match against the elderly German Grandmaster Friedrich Samisch in 1960. =Recognized as International Master= Physics Professor at Marquette University, Dr. Arpad Elo (himself a strong Master chess player), who designed first the American and then the worldwide rating systems for competitive chess, gave Whitaker a rating of 2420 in his authoritative 1978 work The Rating of Chess Players, Past and Present. This represents a very strong Master level. Chessmetrics gives him a peak rating of 2568 in 1928, and shows him as No. 25 in the world in 1918.Chessmetrics.com The Chessmetrics group retrospectively determines Master-level historical chess performances on a worldwide basis. The United States was among the first nations to implement a formalized national rating system, based on mathematical statistics methods, for chess performances, but this did not take place until the 1940s. International chess ratings were introduced by FIDE in 1970, while formalized international titles for chess performances were introduced by FIDE in 1950. After more than ten years of campaigning, Whitaker was finally awarded the International Master title by FIDE in 1965, based on his several strong tournament results from decades earlier.Shady Side: The Life and Crimes of Norman Tweed Whitaker, Chess Master, by John Samuel Hilbert, Cassia publishers, 2000, Certainly, his competitive results from Atlantic City 1921 and Kalamazoo 1927, against strong fields, were at the IM level. It was far from unusual for FIDE to take many years to resolve similar situations for historical chess champions from around the world. In his later years, he was usually listed by the USCF as a Master Emeritus, but in January 1972 (when he was age 81), Chess Life magazine listed his rating as 2142.Chess Life, January 1972, p. 66 A threshold rating of 2200 indicates National Master playing standard in the United States. Later life and death The last years of his life were spent driving around the country in his Volkswagen Beetle, playing in weaker-field chess tournaments in the southern United States that he could potentially win. The vast proportion of very strong American players resided and competed mainly in the northeast sector of the nation during this time. In 1961, he was involved in a serious automobile accident in Arkansas in which his friend and co-author Glenn Hartleb was killed, but Whitaker still continued to compete actively in chess until shortly before his death in 1975 at the age of 85, in Phenix City, Alabama. Playing style Grandmaster Arnold Denker, with co-author Larry Parr, characterized Whitaker as a very strong tactical player, and he won many games this way against even the strongest players living in the U.S., from 1910 right up until the early 1950s. Whitaker named the 'Whitaker Gambit' in the French Defense for the sequence 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Be3, with a gambit of White's e-pawn for open lines; he played this successfully.Denker and Parr, p. 263 and 273-274 Whitaker essayed a classical style, with a strong preference for symmetrical defenses with the Black pieces; he never seriously adopted the hypermodernism (chess) style, developed from 1920 by leading players from his generation such as Aron Nimzowitsch, Alexander Alekhine, Richard Reti, Ernst Grunfeld, Savielly Tartakower, and Efim Bogolyubov. He was strong in the endgame.

It is served by trains to and from Manchester Victoria, towards Rochdale and Wigan Wallgate. History The station as it appeared in 1989 The railway station opened on 29 May 1838 as a terminus on the Manchester and Bolton Railway and was originally named Salford railway station. In 1843, a connection to Manchester Victoria was built, carried on iron columns. The roof suffered from corrosion caused by the sulphurous emissions of locomotives passing through the station and one was replaced after only four years. Between April 1858 and August 1865, to avoid confusion with Salford (Oldfield Rd),Railway Magazine September 1957 p. 615 the station was named Salford (New Bailey Street), after which it reverted to its original name of Salford. To avoid confusion with the newly built Salford Crescent station, in 1988 it was renamed Salford Central. For many years the station was served at peak times only.British Railways Timetable 95, 1973 Platform 1 has a graffiti mural Eastbound ECS entering the station in 1959 Down local train passing through the station in 1959 Westbound empty stock train passing Salford Station in 1963 With only platforms 1 and 2 currently in use (platforms 3 and 4 have been disused since the early 1990s), the station is now managed by Northern Trains and has undergone a major transformation involving construction of a new ticket office as well as making the station building fully accessible by the use of ramps from the entrances to the ticket office and lifts and ramps from the ticket office to the platforms. Location Manchester city centre is accessible either on foot or by a short ride on public transport. Salford is also served by Salford Crescent railway station, close to the University of Salford and Salford Precinct. The ¬£700m Middlewood Locks development will be served by Salford Central. Facilities The ticket office is manned from 06:25 to 19:35, six days per week (closed late evenings and on Sundays, so tickets must be purchased on the train at these times). The ticket hall is connected to the platforms via inclined ramps that are suitable for mobility-impaired users. There are shelters and snack/drink vending machines at platform level, along with timetable posters, digital display screens and automated announcements to provide train running information.Salford Central station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 22 December 2016 Services The station has a frequent service on weekdays and Saturdays (typically 6 tph each way), with all trains to and from Victoria calling here. Destinations served include and (via ) and , and (via Bolton) westbound and (via ) and eastbound (some services also terminate at Victoria). The station was formerly closed on Sundays, but since the summer 2018 timetable change was introduced on 20 May all trains between Salford Crescent and Victoria now call here. Future development A Network Rail report suggests building platforms on the line to Liverpool (via ), the lines of which run through the station but are not provided with platforms. This scheme has since been adopted by Transport for Greater Manchester and included in their Capital Works Programme for 2015‚Äì16 to 2020‚Äì21. This will see an additional platform built and the old platforms 3 & 4 reopened, at a cost of ¬£20.5 million and will allow Liverpool, Chester & Manchester Airport-bound trains (using the Ordsall Chord) to call here. All lines through the station have now been electrified and electric working on the Preston via Bolton route commenced on Monday 11 February 2019 utilising Class 319 Electric Multiple Units.

Early life and education He was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk. His parents were Scottish and had moved to Norfolk in 1936. The family moved to Darlington in 1951. Hamilton's civil engineer father died a few months later. A keen soccer player, at the age of 15 Hamilton was diagnosed with a heart complaint. Unable to play games, he developed his interest in poetry. At age 17 in sixth form at Darlington Grammar school Hamilton produced two issues of his own magazine, which was called The Scorpion. For the second issue he sent a questionnaire to various literary figures in London asking if there was any advice they could give young authors. Around fifty or so replies were received from figures such as Louis Golding. After leaving school he did his National Service in M√∂nchengladbach, Germany. He then attended Keble College, Oxford, and within a year started a magazine Tomorrow. The first issues were patchy, but the magazine grew in confidence, publishing an early play by Harold Pinter in its fourth and final issue. Career In 1962 Hamilton started The Review magazine, with Michael Fried, John Fuller, and Colin Falck. The Review became the most influential postwar British poetry magazine, publishing a wide variety of writers and both short and long pieces. It ran until its 10th anniversary issue in 1972. In 1964 The Review published a pamphlet of Hamilton's poems entitled Pretending Not to Sleep. It was one of three pamphlets that made up issue no. 13 of The Review. In 1965, to make ends meet, Hamilton took a three-day-a-week job at the Times Literary Supplement, which soon grew to be the position of Poetry and Fiction Editor, a post he held until 1973. In 1970 Faber and Faber published The Visit, a slender book of Hamilton's poems. This was a somewhat reworked and expanded version of the 1964 pamphlet. The thirty-three poems contained in The Visit all reflect Hamilton's concise writing style. Hamilton subsequently spoke about the relationship between the stressful circumstances of his personal life ‚Äì in particular the mental illness of his wife ‚Äì and the brevity of the poems. \\"You had to keep your control however bad things were; you had to be in charge. And I suppose the perfect poem became something that had to contain the maximum amount of control ‚Äì and of suffering.\\" In 1974 Hamilton started The New Review, a large format glossy magazine. Its first issue was 100 pages and featured many well-known writers. Again it was influential in literary circles, and encouraged younger writers. But the magazine depended on Arts Council funding, and when that stopped, four and half years and 50 issues later, it closed. Hamilton then wrote freelance, including regularly for the New Statesman. In 1976 another pamphlet of poems appeared, entitled Returning. It contained twelve new poems. After his friend poet Robert Lowell died in 1977 Hamilton wrote a biography of him which was well received. Encouraged by that, he began writing a biography and critique of J. D. Salinger. Famously averse to publicity, Salinger took legal action in Salinger v. Random House to prevent the book being published. He was successful in denying Hamilton the right to quote from his letters or paraphrase them. Hamilton however was able to incorporate these frustrations into the book, entitled In Search of J.D. Salinger. From 1984 to 1987 Hamilton presented the BBC Bookmark television program, featuring many well-known writers. In 1988 Faber published a new collection of his verse: Fifty Poems. This included the poems previously published in The Visit, together with eleven of the poems from Returning and six new poems. In the preface Hamilton wrote: \\"Fifty poems in twenty-five years: not much to show for half a lifetime, you might think. And in certain moods, I would agree.\\" Ten years later Faber published \\"Sixty Poems\\", again matching his age and these also incorporated earlier poems. In 1989 he guest- edited the second number of the literary magazine Soho Square published by Bloomsbury. His experience with Salinger inspired Keepers of the Flame, his 1992 book about the history of literary estates and unofficial biographers. His love of football led him to write Gazza Agonistes and Gazza Italia in 1993 and 1994, about Paul Gascoigne's seemingly wasted talent. In 1999 Cargo Press published 'Another Round At The Pillars' a collection of 'essays, poems and reflections on Ian Hamilton' to celebrate his 60th birthday with contributions from a range of prominent authors and poets such as Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan, Harold Pinter and Clive James. HIs final book, in 2002, was \\"Against Oblivion: some lives of the Twentieth Century Poets'. Taking Samuel Johnson as his inspiration, he chose forty-five dead twentieth-century poets and assessed their achievement with his customary economy and wit. The book was published posthumously. He died of cancer in 2001 in London. His first wife, Gisela Dietzel and their son Matthew Hamilton survive him, as does his second wife Ahdaf Soueif and their two sons and his long-term partner, Patricia Wheatley, by whom he had a son and daughter, Catherine and William Hamilton. In 2002 Between the Lines published \\"Ian Hamilton in Conversation with Dan Jacobson\\", in which the novelist and academic Dan Jacobson interviewed Hamilton about his life and career. In 2009 Faber and Faber published his Collected Poems, with an introduction by Alan Jenkins. A selection of Hamilton's books by other poets were donated to Keble College, Oxford, where they are accessible to students as the Ian Hamilton Poetry Library.

He was stabbed by another playwright. Life Very little is known about Henry Porter's life beyond the entries in the diary of Philip Henslowe the theatre manager. He is described as a \\"gentleman\\" and a \\"poor scholar\\", and as the play is set in Abingdon, near Oxford, and shows knowledge of the area around Oxford it is assumed he studied there. Attempts to plausibly connect him with the records of the several Henry Porters at Oxford have been fruitless. He is known for one surviving play, The Two Angry Women of Abington, first published in two editions in London in 1599. The Two Angry Women was written before his first recorded work for Henslowe in 1598. Porter was praised by Francis Meres in his Palladis Tamia in 1598 as one of \\"the best for Comedy amongst us\\". There is linguistic evidence that he may have contributed comic scenes to Dr. Faustus by Christopher Marlowe. Works The Two Angry Women of Abington has been compared favourably in style and quality to The Merry Wives of Windsor. It is a rollicking country piece including two comic characters, Dick Coomes and Nicholas Proverbes, who are advertised in the title page of one original edition. Henslowe records several payments in 1598 for the book and costumes for the play, but it must have been performed before 1599, as there is a reference to these characters in Plaine Percevall, a pamphlet published that year in response to Martin Marprelate.H. Porter, The two angry women of Abington, ed. W. W. Greg (1913) Henslowe's Diary mentions other plays, Love Prevented (1598), Hot Anger soon Cold, with Henry Chettle and Ben Jonson (1598), the second part of The Two Angry Women of Abingdon (1598), The Four Merry Women of Abingdon (1599), and The Spencers (1599), with Chettle. It is possible that \\"the second part of the Two Angry Women\\" was not a separate work, and it is not known whether the later plays were delivered before Porter's death. In 1598 Porter and Chettle were paid 20 shillings by Henslowe to write a play called The Second Part of Black Batman of the North. It has been suggested that some of the money received from Henslowe by Porter was used to pay Chettle's debts. The considerable sums paid to Porter prove that his plays were popular, although the entries suggest he was unreliable. Henslowe notes that the advance to Porter and Chettle was made after Porter \\"hath geven me his worde for the performance of the same and all so for my money\\". In February 1599 Henslowe acquired the sole rights of any play in which Porter had a hand, in return for a considerable advance of forty shillings. Porter's borrowings became more frequent, and the sums allowed less. Death It is likely that the publication of The Two Angry Women of Abington was prompted by Porter's death. The last definite record of him is an IOU in his hand in Henslowe's diary on 26 May 1599. Leslie Hotson discovered the record of a case in the Southwark Assizes, which records the death of a Henry Porter on 7 June 1599 in Southwark. He is recorded as having been struck a mortal wound in the left breast with a rapier \\"of the value of two shillings\\" the previous day.Hotson, Leslie M., The Adventure of a Single Rapier, Atlantic Monthly, July 1931 The killer is named as John Day, almost certainly the playwright of that name, who worked for Philip Henslowe.Hotson, Leslie M., The Adventure of a Single Rapier, Atlantic Monthly, July 1931. Although collaboration was common there is no record of Porter and Day working together. Ben Jonson, with whom Porter did collaborate, described Day as a \\"rogue\\" and a \\"base fellow\\". Day was charged with murder, but admitted manslaughter, on the grounds of self-defence, his plea in formal terms being that \\"he fled to a certain wall beyond which, etc\\". Although it is not recorded he seems to have obtained a Royal Pardon. The rapier was a fashionable but particularly dangerous weapon, more likely to cause death than traditional swords. It is ironic that one of the characters in The Two Angry Women laments \\"this poking fight of a rapier and dagger\\" saying that \\"a good sword-and-buckler man will be spitted like a cat or a coney\\". The irony would be greater still if the author of this was the same Henry Porter granted a \\"Pardon de se defendendo.\\"Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1591-4, p. 135Shears, Rosetta E., New Facts About Henry Porter, PMLA 42 (1927) 642 There are parallels between the deaths of Henry Porter and his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe: both were stabbed to death south of the Thames in London, Marlowe in Deptford in 1593, and Porter in Southwark in 1599; both deaths were explicated in modern times by Leslie Hotson.

There is no known cause or cure. Acute interstitial pneumonitis is often categorized as both an interstitial lung disease and a form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but it is distinguished from the chronic forms of interstitial pneumonia such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Symptoms  The most common symptoms of acute interstitial pneumonitis are highly productive cough with expectoration of thick mucus, fever, and difficulties breathing. These often occur over a period of one to two weeks before medical attention is sought. The presence of fluid means the person experiences a feeling similar to 'drowning'. Difficulties breathing can quickly progress to an inability to breathe without support (respiratory failure). Acute interstitial pneumonitis typically progresses rapidly, with hospitalization and mechanical ventilation often required only days to weeks after initial symptoms of cough, fever, and difficulties breathing develop.  Diagnosis  Rapid progression from initial symptoms to respiratory failure is a key feature. An x-ray that shows ARDS is necessary for diagnosis (fluid in the small air sacs (alveoli) in both lungs). In addition, a biopsy of the lung that shows organizing diffuse alveolar damage is required for diagnosis. Other diagnostic tests are useful in excluding other similar conditions, but history, x-ray, and biopsy are essential. These other tests may include basic blood work, blood cultures, and bronchoalveolar lavage. The clinical picture is similar to ARDS, but AIP differs from ARDS in that the cause for AIP is not known. File:CRIM.PULMONOLOGY2012-678249.001.jpgAcute interstitial pneumonia showing a marked reduction in lung capacity File:Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) Idiopathic DAD 3.jpg File:Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) Idiopathic DAD 2.jpg File:Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) Idiopathic DAD.jpg  Treatment  Treatment is primarily supportive. Management in an intensive care unit is required and the need for mechanical ventilation is common. Therapy with corticosteroids is generally attempted, though their usefulness has not been established. The only treatment that has met with success to date is a lung transplant.  Prognosis  Sixty percent of people with acute interstitial pneumonitis will die in the first six months of illness. The median survival is 1¬Ω months. However, most people who have one episode do not have a second. People who survive often recover lung function completely.  Epidemiology  Acute interstitial pneumonitis occurs most frequently among people older than forty years old. It affects men and women equally. There are no known risk factors; in particular, smoking is not associated with increased risk.  History  Acute interstitial pneumonitis was first described in 1935 by Louis Hamman and Arnold Rich, and given the name Hamman‚ÄìRich syndrome.

She taught and did most of her research at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, as well as the author of numerous books. Early career Vivan Paley was born in Chicago, Illinois. After receiving her Ph.B. from the University of Chicago in 1947, and a B.A. in Psychology from Newcomb College in 1950, she began her teaching career in New Orleans in the 1950s, and later in Great Neck, New York. It was during her time teaching in New Orleans that she began to reflect on some of the ways in which childhood learning at the time was being choked by an overemphasis on strict learning boundaries (e.g., that children could only be allowed to learn how to write in capital letters, not lower-case) and perfunctory memorization. While teaching in Great Neck, she began to reflect on how play can be the \\"most usable context\\" for interaction and intellectual growth among kindergartners. This view, however, flew in the face of what many early education teachers thought at the time, that with the rise of television's easily accessible portrayals of violence, children were becoming too intense and restless, and if anything, needed more vigilant limits on playtime. Many of her insights during this time laid the foundation for her later writings. After receiving her M.A. from Hofstra University in 1962, she returned to Chicago, where she dedicated the rest of her teaching career. It was during the 1970s that she began writing the books on early childhood learning (see below) which have made her so well regarded in early education circles. Despite her status today, however, she described the first 13 years of her teaching career as being an \\"uninspired and uninspiring teacher.\\" Research Throughout her career, Paley wrote numerous books containing her observations of and reflections about her classroom and students, primarily those at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools where she taught pre-school and kindergarten for many years. To collect her data, Paley made audio-recordings of her classrooms so that she could listen to and analyze the interactions that occurred.Listening to Children‚Äôs Stories: An Interview with Vivian Gussin Paley, in Active Learner: A Firefox Journal for Teachers, v3 n1 p12-16, Win 1998 In so doing, she would often hear private conversations between children that would help her think about the unique way young children communicate with other young children. Generally, each of her books contains one driving theme. For example, You Can‚Äôt Say You Can‚Äôt Play focuses on the desire of some students to exclude others during classroom playtime. Paley imposed a rule that children could not exclude other children from play, and discusses the importance of fairness in the classroom. In her books White Teacher and Kwanzaa and Me, Paley explores issues of multiculturalism within the classroom. In particular, she reflects on her own experiences as a white teacher of children of color and analyzes how she can best support and promote a racially diverse classroom. Many educators believe that Paley's biggest legacy is in the area of storytelling and fantasy play, which she directly addresses in her books A Child‚Äôs Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play, The Boy Who Would Be a Helicopter, Bad Guys Don‚Äôt Have Birthdays: Fantasy Play at Four. Paley argues in these and other works that storytelling and fantasy play can significantly impact a child's academic and social growth. They help young children make sense of the world around them, adapt to the classroom, develop language, and collaborate with peers. Some critics of the federal No Child Left Behind Act point to Paley's research as evidence that learning and developing can take place using storytelling and other means, which should be used in lieu of, or in addition to, the NCLB-mandated direct instruction and teacher-led activities. Vivian Gussin Paley was patron to MakeBelieve Arts. MakeBelieve Arts have an Early Years strand which is dedicated to Paleys work called Helicopter Stories: Letting Imagination Fly. This grew out of Vivian Gussin Paley's book The Boy Who Would Be a Helicopter (published 1990 Harvard University Press). After studying Vivian's work and visiting her in America, Artistic Director, Trisha Lee began pioneering the approach in the UK.

It is located close to the city centre, between Haymarket and Gorgie. The area is now primarily residential. It is centred around Dalry Road, which has numerous shops, restaurants and small businesses. Lying outside the old city walls and west of the castle, the area began as part of the agricultural estate of Dalry House (constructed in 1661), the exception being the Dalry Mill, recorded as the oldest paper mill in Scotland, now demolished. In the Victorian period industrial development followed along with large scale tenement construction, new road layouts and the addition of railway infrastructure, all of which came to occupy the former fields. By the early 21st century most of the industry of Dalry has disappeared, with the former sites converted to private housing. Etymology The name Dalry may derive from Dail Rig or Dail Ruigh, Scottish Gaelic for the \\"Place of the Fields\\" or \\"King's Field\\" respectively. \\"Field of the heather\\" from Dail and Scottish Gaelic fhraoich, heather, has also been suggested as a derivation.Ross, David (2001),Scottish Place-names, Birlinn, Edinburgh, p.63. Location Haymarket railway station is the main line railway station serving the area and marks the northern boundary of Dalry. Dalry is centred on Dalry Road, which, at Haymarket, is the beginning of the A70 road. The area is often mentioned along with the neighbouring area of Gorgie to the southwest, and the joint name Gorgie-Dalry is commonly used by the City of Edinburgh Council. The West Approach Road with the area of Fountainbridge beyond marks the south-eastern boundary of Dalry. Fountainbridge is accessed via the Telfer Subway, which passes underneath the West Approach Road. The subway was built in the mid-19th century to provide access between Dalry and Fountainbridge under the Caledonian Railway main line but it remained as a primary pedestrian route following the replacement of the railway by the West Approach Road in the 1970s. Dalry also borders the areas of Ardmillan to the south, Roseburn to the north-west and Haymarket to the north. Dalry has a range of shops, restaurants and leisure facilities. Princes Street, in central Edinburgh, is ten to fifteen minutes' walk from the area. Many of Edinburgh's major employers are also within walking distance. The nearest railway station is Haymarket railway station, which is located directly adjacent to the northern boundary of Dalry. History and architecture =Early history= Dalry is first recorded around 1328 when, together with Merchiston, it was owned by William Bisset. Dalry Mill was located on these lands and is stated to have existed in various forms from at least 1478 to sometime in the mid-18th century. The mill was actively engaged in paper production in 1590, the first paper mill recorded to exist in Scotland.Morris, John (2007). Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Volume 3: Ambition and Industry, Edinburgh University Press, p. 17 The paper mill produced 'white writing and printing papers' for the nearby city centre printing and publishing.Michael, Meighan (2012) Scotland's Lost Industries, Amberley Publishing Limited. Today it would be considered to be in the Roseburn area rather than Dalry. Dalry House is the oldest building in Dalry, built in 1661. With the exception of the mill the area was primarily agricultural land, lying outside the Old Town of Edinburgh. The former mansion house, Dalry House, built about 1661 still exists. The house, once set in extensive grounds, is now surrounded by tenements and is located on Orwell Place. It was built probably for and later owned and occupied by the Chiesley family. The house was reputedly haunted by a member of the family called John Chiesley. John Chiesley, the local landowner was married to Margaret Nicholson. The marriage was said to be unhappy (although it gave children including Rachel Chiesley, Lady Grange) and Margaret took her husband to court for aliment. She was awarded 1,700 merks by Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath, the Lord President of the Court of Session. Furious with the result, John Chiesley shot the judge, Lockhart, dead near his home in Old Bank Close off the Lawnmarket as he walked home from church on Easter Sunday, 31 March 1689.Macaulay (2009) The Prisoner of St Kilda: The true story of the unfortunate Lady Grange. Edinburgh: Leith pp. 23‚Äì24 Chiesley made no attempt to escape and confessed at his trial, held before the Lord Provost the next day. Two days later he was taken from the Tolbooth to the Mercat Cross on the High Street. His right hand was cut off before he was hanged, and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed round his neck.Macaulay (2009) The Prisoner of St Kilda: The true story of the unfortunate Lady Grange. Edinburgh: Leith pp. 29‚Äì30 According to Robert Chambers writing in 1824, \\"The body was stolen from the gallows, as was supposed, by his friends, and it was never known what had become of it, till more than a century after, when, in removing the hearth-stone of a cottage in Dairy Park, near Edinburgh, a human skeleton was found, with the remains of a pistol near the situation of the neck. No doubt was entertained that these were the remains of Chiesly,\\" Five years later in 1694, Robert Chieslie, John's brother, served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh.History of Edinburgh from its Foundation to the Present Time in 9 Books: Book 3 p.227: Civil Government Dalry House and the surrounding lands passed to the Walker family between 1790 and 1812. In 1870 the house was sold to the Scottish Episcopal Church and from the late 19th century to about 1960 it was used as a teacher training college and by the Edinburgh & Leith Old People's Welfare Committee for social activities, classes and a lunch club until closed down in 2002. The actor Alastair Sim taught at the college between 1922 and 1924. The house was then renovated and converted into private flats in the early 21st century. =19th century to present day= The Dalry 'colonies' are a series of terraced houses located in the north of Dalry. Dalry was intensively developed in the 19th century and contains a mix of traditional tenements, \\"colonies\\" (terraced houses where one floor has an entrance at one side, and the other floor has an entrance on the other side; street names follow the buildings rather than the roads between them). The Dalry Colonies are accessed from Dalry Place off the east end of Dalry Road and comprise eight streets: Lewis Terrace, Walker Terrace, Douglas Terrace, Cobden Terrace, Argyll Terrace, Bright Terrace, Atholl Terrace and McLaren Terrace and Breadalbane Terrace. Four of the streets are named after politicians, prominent in the Anti-Corn Law League; Richard Cobden, Duncan McLaren, John Bright and Samuel Walker. Another was named for Bailie David Lewis (editor of the Edinburgh-based weekly Reformer publication). and the other three names are places in Scotland. The colonies in Dalry were built between 1868 and 1870 by the Edinburgh Cooperative Building Company Limited, primarily to house Caledonian Railway workers. The Dalry Colonies are Category B Listed buildings. The growth of industrial buildings, in proximity to the railway development of the time created new jobs in Dalry. These included employment with the railways themselves, as well as at the Fountain Brewery, the Caledonian Distillery, the North British Rubber Company's Castle Mill (1856) and the Grove Street Biscuit Factory (1868). This led to a surge in requirements for new residential development, leading to a significant boom in tenement housing building in the late 19th century mainly by the Scottish businessman and baronet Sir James Steel.Rodger, Richard (2004) The Transformation of Edinburgh: Land, Property and Trust in the Nineteenth Century. Cambridge University Press Steel purchased and developed three main parcels of land; the Caledonian, the Downfield and the Murieston developments, all built by 1887. In the Victorian and Edwardian periods a number of local landmarks were constructed, some of which remain today. Dalry for example has one of Edinburgh's Victorian swimming baths, now known as Dalry Swim Centre, in Caledonian Crescent. The area also used to have Edinburgh's oldest and Scotland's second oldest purpose-built cinema which opened in December, 1912 as 'The Haymarket Cinema', located at 90 Dalry Road and changed to the 'Scotia' in 1949. Only the foyer remains as a tattoo parlour (itself closed since 2016) and the main auditorium was demolished in 2013. A 1905 Railway Clearing House diagram of Edinburgh railways showing Dalry Road and Dalry Junction stops The north east of Dalry has seen major development including a former railway depot at Haymarket, which lay predominantly empty since its closure in the 1960s. The site was amongst those on the shortlist of potential locations for the Scottish Parliament Building. Construction of a new ¬£200m retail, hotel and office development commenced in 2013 with work to reinforce the active rail tunnels under the site, which run east from Haymarket station to Edinburgh Waverley. Ground level construction commenced in May 2016, with the development scheduled to be completed by 2018. In the early 21st century a substantial development occurred to the north west of Dalry on the industrial site of a former distillery that occupied land in both Dalry and in Haymarket. This was the Caledonian Distillery, a grain whisky distillery, which was in operation from 1885 to 1988. The site is now occupied by 20 acres of private residential housing in an estate named Dalry Gait. A series of railway works, the 'Dalry Road Depot' also existed to the east of Dalry, including a goods yard and several engine sheds. These were demolished in the 1960s (with the main engine shed being demolished in October 1965). The site is part of the West Approach Road and a park. The railway works served the former Wester Dalry Branchline, which was a part of the Caledonian Railway to Leith via the now defunct Edinburgh Princes Street railway station. The railway had two stops in Dalry; 'Dalry Road' and 'Dalry Junction'. The Dalry Road Stop was a passenger station, built to meet demand following the tenement building boom in Dalry, and it opened in 1894. The station closed on 30 April 1962. The line is now closed and removed; a small section of the platform is visible on a park path near Orwell Terrace. The section of the line between Haymarket West Junction and the Dalry Junction station is now a roadway, the West Approach Road which takes traffic directly into the city centre. The Balmoral bar was a former pub on Dalry road, which was destroyed by a fire in 2009. The collapse of the floor during the fire led to the death of one of the attending fire- fighters. The subsequent investigation into the Dalry fire led to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service being fined following health and safety breaches. =Religious buildings= There are three church buildings in Dalry. St Martin of Tours Episcopal Church, constructed in 1883 is located on Dalry Road and is still used for services. St Martin's is a Scottish Episcopal Church and is located within the Diocese of Edinburgh. The other two are former churches which no longer operate as religious buildings. St Bride's Community Centre is a local community education centre that offers classes and activities for adults and children. It is run jointly by a local charity, the St Bride's association and also by the City of Edinburgh Council. The centre occupies the former St Bride's Church, which was constructed in 1908. In addition the charity also runs an art and education centre, the Garvald Centre, on Orwell Place, adjacent to Dalry House. The Dalry Congregational Church, on Caledonian Road, was constructed in 1872 by Alexander Heron and has been converted into accommodation as flats. =School and parks= Dalry has one school, built in 1876; the Dalry Primary School, for children in years 1 through to 7 in the Scottish Education System. The school won a Creative Learning Award in 2015. Dalry has two areas of parkland within its boundaries. The first is Murieston Park, a small community park with a children's playground, which is located on Murieston Crescent. A second area of parkland occupies part of the former railway goods yard and borders the West Approach Road. This includes a small sports pitch and children's playground. Dalry Cemetery Dalry Cemetery was designed by David Cousin in 1846 in the wake of the success of both Dean Cemetery in the west and Warriston Cemetery in the north. The cemetery was developed and owned by the Metropolitan Cemetery Association. It represented part of the second wave of cemetery building in the city, specifically serving the south-west sections. It was built on land that was part of the Dalry estate, which was variously owned by the Chieslies. It comprises 6 acres and is one of the smaller cemeteries in Edinburgh. The lodge house post-dates the main construction and was added in 1873, to a design by the firm of Peddie and Kinnear. A Gothic entrance arch, built adjoining the lodge, was demolished in the 20th century. The cemetery was used most actively in the 19th century. However, it is the location of several 20th century Commonwealth War Graves, including the resting place of 24 casualties of the First World War and 2 of the Second World War. By the mid-1970s the cemetery was neglected and in great disrepair. A clean-up and improvement campaign was organised by the 'Action for Dalry Cemetery Group' resulting in a series of improvements completed by September 1976. In 1987 Edinburgh Council compulsorily purchased the cemetery and after further restoration it was reopened for access in May 1991. Adjacent to the cemetery is a long steep lane called 'Coffin Lane'. The lane is bounded by high walls on both sides and has been used as a murder location in several fiction books including the Rebus novel Let It Bleed by Ian Rankin. The novel Crime by Irvine Welsh also includes reference to Dalry.Welsh, Irvine (2008), Crime, Random House, p.92 File:Dalry Cemetery, Fountainbridge - geograph.org.uk - 1436104.jpg File:Dalry Cemetery - geograph.org.uk - 1436110.jpg File:Dalry Cemetery - geograph.org.uk - 773005.jpg File:Dalry Angel (8577788417).jpg File:Dalry Cemetery (8578893792).jpg File:Family tombstone, Dalry Cemetery - geograph.org.uk - 1436116.jpg =Notable interments= *George Cupples (1822‚Äì1891) author and philologist and his wife Anne Jane Cupples (1839‚Äì1896) author. *Peter Devine (photographer) (1820‚Äì1875) photographer and miniature painter. *David Kerr (sculptor) (1814‚Äì1858) plus his sculptor grandson, David S.

Morrison (1838-1897), who received the Medal of Honor for exceptional bravery during the Civil War. Morrison was laid down by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Wash., 30 June 1942; launched 4 July 1943, sponsored by Miss Margaret M. Morrison, daughter of Coxswain Morrison; and commissioned 18 December 1943, Commander Walter H. Price in command. After shakedown off San Diego, California, Morrison departed Seattle 25 February 1944 for the South Pacific, via Pearl Harbor and the Marshalls. In mid-April the destroyer joined TG 50.17 for screening operations off Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralties, during the fueling of carriers then striking Japanese installations in the Carolines.  Central Pacific campaigns  Morrison returned to Pearl Harbor 9 May to train for the giant amphibious leap into the Marianas. Departing Pearl 31 May via Roi, Marshalls, she arrived east of Saipan 13 June for a busy month. Her accurate gunfire supported the initial landings on Saipan the 15th and provided close fire support thereafter. With little aid the crew fought off night air attacks 17 through 19 June. Of 40 enemy planes that approached at dusk the 17th, only 15 got by the attacks of the Navy's carrier interceptor planes; and Morrison shot down three of those. On 2 August the destroyer rendezvoused off Guam with Task Group 58.4 (TG 58.4) for flight operations following the landings on Guam 21 July. Eight days later Morrison departed Guam for Eniwetok, Marshalls, where she remained from the 13th until she got underway 29 August for the Philippines, arriving off Mindanao the morning of 9 September. That same day, the beginning of a 2-day strike on Mindanao, a Japanese convoy of 50 sampans and freighters was sighted heading north. Morrison led the intercepting force which destroyed the 10 to 15 sampans that survived the strafing by planes. She pushed on for airstrike operations on Peleliu, Palau; the Carolines; and Luzon, Manila, and Samar Island, Philippines, through September. On 2 October Morrison sailed with TG 38.3 for picket duty off Okinawa, during the airstrikes there and on other Islands in the Ryukyus 10 October. She continued on screen and plane guard operations off Formosa and northern Luzon during a 5-day attack beginning the 12th. On 16 October she screened Houston (CL-81) and Canberra (CA-70) as they retired to Ulithi.  Philippines campaign  During the Battle for Leyte Gulf, 23 to 26 October, Morrison operated off Luzon. On the 24th, she came to the aid of Princeton (CVL-23), badly damaged by a Japanese bomb, and picked up approximately 400 survivors in an hour and a half. The destroyer then pulled alongside Princeton to assist in fighting fire; she had just reached her position when the small aircraft carrier, drifting and rolling, wedged Morrison's mast and forward stack between her uptakes. Morrison managed to get clear and Birmingham (CL-62) took her place. Ten minutes later the after third of Princeton blew off. Not only did Birmingham suffer topside damage and heavy casualties, but Princeton was then so badly damaged she had to be sunk by torpedoes. Morrison debarked the Princeton survivors at Ulithi 27 October and got underway for the West Coast, via Pearl Harbor, in company with Irwin (DD-794) and Birmingham, arriving San Francisco, California, 17 November. On 9 February 1945 the destroyer steamed back to the South Pacific, stopping at Pearl Harbor on the 15th.  Battle of Okinawa  After shore bombardment exercises in the Hawaiian Islands, Morrison departed for Ulithi 3 March. By 21 March she had joined Task Force 54 (TF 54) underway to support the invasion of Okinawa. The destroyer arrived off the southern shores of Okinawa on the 25th, 7 days before the landings 1 April, and joined in the preparations of bombardment. In the early morning of 31 March she sank Japanese submarine I-8. After Stockton (DD-646) made a positive sound contact off Okinawa and expended her depth charges in the attack, Morrison arrived on the scene to see the submarine surface, then immediately submerge. She dropped a pattern of charges which seconds later forced the sub to the surface, where it was sunk by gunfire. At daylight Morrison's small boats rescued the lone survivor. The ship continued shore bombardment, night illumination, and screen operations off ≈åshima Beach. On the night of 11 April Morrison assisted Anthony (DD-515) in illuminating and sinking enemy landing craft heading north along the beach. Three days later Morrison began radar picket duty. Her first two stations, southwest of Okinawa, were occasionally raided at night. She replaced Daly (DD-519) at the third station 28 April after the other destroyer was hit by a kamikaze. On 30 April Morrison was shifted to the most critical station on the picket line. After 3 days of bad weather had prevented air raids, the dawn of 4 May was bright, clear, and ominous. At 07:15 the combat air patrol was called on to stop a force of about 25 planes headed toward Morrison, but some got through. The first attack on Morrison, a main target as fighter-director ship, was a suicide run by a \\"Zeke\\". The plane broke through heavy flak to drop a bomb which splashed off the starboard beam and exploded harmlessly. Next a \\"Val\\" and another \\"Zeke\\" followed with unsuccessful suicide runs. About 08:25 a \\"Zeke\\" approached through intense antiaircraft fire to crash into a stack and the bridge. The blow inflicted heavy casualties and knocked out most of the electrical equipment. The next three planes, all old twin-float biplanes, maneuvered, despite heavy attack, to crash into the damaged ship. With the fourth hit, Morrison, heavily damaged, began to list sharply to starboard. Few communication circuits remained intact enough to transmit the order to abandon ship. Two explosions occurred almost simultaneously, the bow lifted into the air, and by 08:40 Morrison had plunged beneath the surface. The ship sank so quickly that most men below decks were lost, a total of 152. In July 1957 the sunken hull of Morrison was donated, along with those of some 26 other ships sunk in the Ryukyus area to the Government of the Ryukyu Islands for salvage. Morrison received eight battle stars for World War II service.  References  *Brown, David. Warship Losses of World War Two.

Name Hammadi Agrebi stadium by night At the time of its creation, the stadium was named 7 November Stadium, the date that Zine El Abidine Ben Ali assumed the Presidency on 7 November 1987 in a bloodless coup d'√©tat that ousted President Habib Bourguiba. But, following his ousting, it took the name of Olympic Stadium of Rad√®s (Stade Olympique de Rad√®s). On August 22, 2020, following the death of Hammadi Agrebi, the prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh announced that he will be renamed to his name. This announcement provokes the surprise of the mayor of Rad√®s who indicates that the municipal council meets on August 24 to make a decision. In addition, a decree dated July 12, 2019 stipulates that it is only allowed to give the names of deceased persons to monuments three years after the date of death. On August 24, the Ministry of Local Affairs replied that the stadium was placed under the direction of the Ministry of Youth and Sports (not under the direction of the municipality of Rad√®s) and that it did not fall within the framework of the decree of July 12, 2019, so his name was officially changed.

The name stands as the Russian language abbreviation for its full name Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Romanian Front, Black Sea Fleet, and Odessa Oblast ().Odessa Oblast in that instance meant the territory of the Odessa MD. During that period of time the Russian Odessa Military District (Odessa MD) before being overrun by Soviets included the following guberniyas: Kherson Governorate, Bessarabia guberniya, Taurida Governorate, and parts of Podolia Governorate and Volyn Governorate. Brief overview Rumcherod was created at the 1st Congress of Front and District Soviets in Odessa (May 23‚ÄìJune 9, 1917). The majority in that first meeting consisted of Mensheviks and Esers, who supported the Russian Provisional Government and the continuation of the war to the very end. Their position was against Bolsheviks and their October Revolution. On the order of self appointed Nikolai Krylenko who performed functions of the Chief Commander of Sovnarkom Rumcherod was forced to be dissolved. On 23 December 1917 through 5 January 1918 in Odessa the Soviets organized congress of Soviets that elected the new Rumcherod consisting of 180 people. The composition of the second Rumcherod was 70 Bolsheviks, 55 left Esers, 23 representatives of peasant organizations, and 32 from other parties. The committee recognized the Soviet government and approved its policy. V.Volodarsky (Moisei Goldstein) attended the congress as the representative of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) (RSDLP(b)). The former member of the Petrograd committee of RSDLP(b) Vladimir Yudovsky was elected the Chairman of Rumcherod which served as the highest authority for the Odessa Soviet Republic. From January to March 1918 the Rumcherod militarily supported the pro-Soviet forces in the Moldavian Democratic Republic, and later opposed the troops sent into the region by Romania. Later the Soviet republic was forced to comply with the conditions of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and withdraw due to the advance German-Austrian military first to Nikolayev, then to Rostov-on-Don and Yeysk. In May 1918 it was dissolved while its chairman Yudovsky relocated to Moscow.

The Vaivara camp complex was commanded by German officers Hans Aumeier, Otto Brennais and Franz von Bodmann and consisted of 20 field camps, some of which existed only for short periods. It is estimated that 1,800‚Äì2,000 prisoners perished at Klooga from wanton killings, epidemics and working conditions. Most of them were Jews. Those who survived were transported to the Stutthof concentration camp in occupied Poland ahead of the Soviet advance.Council of Europe: \\"Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes in Estonia\\" Teaching Remembrance. Cached by Gigablast from www.coe.int LeafletEstonia.asp on 21 February 2009; retrieved 12 February 2015. Klooga map eng The camp During the German occupation, Estonia was part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland, a German civilian administration that governed the Baltic states and western Belorussia. Over time, at any moment Klooga held between about 1,500 and 2,500 male and female prisoners. Prisoners included Soviet POW, Estonian political prisoners and Jews. Jews constituted a vast majority after large numbers of them forcibly relocated in August and September 1943 from the Kovno and Vilna Ghettos in Lithuania, and Salaspils Ghetto in Latvia. Smaller numbers of inmates were from Estonia, Russia and Romania. The entire camp was enclosed by barbed wire. The men's and women's camps, which were separated by some 600 yards, had large two-story buildings for housing the prisoners. German SS units and members of the 287th Estonian Police Battalion served as guards. Prisoners were forced to work in peat harvesting as well as in the camp cement works, sawmills, brickworks, and factory, which manufactured clogs for camp prisoners. Conditions were extremely harsh. In the early years of the camp's operation, a group of some 75 prisoners began to organize resistance within Klooga; however, the frequent transfer of prisoners from camp to camp ‚Äî both within Estonia and throughout Nazi-occupied territories ‚Äî stymied the underground movement's ability to mount an effective resistance. Evacuation and liberation When the Soviet army began its advance through Nazi-occupied Estonia in September 1944, the SS started to evacuate the camp. Many prisoners were sent west by sea to the Stutthof concentration camp near Danzig and to Freiburg in Schlesien, present day ≈öwiebodzice, then in Germany, now Poland. From 19‚Äì22 September 1944, with the perimeter of the camp guarded by 60‚Äì70 Estonian guards and SS recruits of the 20th SS Division, a German task force began systematically slaughtering the remaining prisoners in a nearby forest. According to Ruth Bettina Birn the execution of 2,000 prisoners was conducted by Estonian soldiers of 20th SS Division and presumably Schutzmannschaft Battalion under German command. According to Soviet sources, approximately 2,000 were shot, then their bodies were stacked onto wooden pyres and burned. On 22 September 1944, when Soviet troops reached the Klooga camp, only 85 of the 2,400 prisoners remaining post- evacuation had managed to survive by hiding inside the camp or escaping into the surrounding forests. The liberation forces found numerous pyres of stacked corpses left unburned by the camp's guards when they fled. SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Hans Aumeier, a German, who was Lagerkommandant (camp commander) for all Estonia, as well as having worked at Auschwitz, Dachau, and Buchenwald, was subsequently arrested and put on trial for crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death in Krak√≥w, Poland, on 22 December 1947, and executed on 28 January 1948.

It is about young children who save the world from destruction by playing baseball, the central theme and symbol throughout the novel. Summerland weaves elements of a World Series, parallel-universe road trip, and a hero's odyssey. The book received mixed reviews; The New York Times called it \\"bewilderingly busy\\" and likened it to \\"the novelization of an animated action film\\". Plot summary The story begins on a small island off the coast of Washington called Clam Island. The central character, Ethan Feld, is on one of the island's baseball teams despite being terrible at the game. He encounters a gracious werefox, Cutbelly, who explains the Lodgepole, a giant tree connecting all worlds, to the ignorant Ethan. Cutbelly explains that Coyote is planning to destroy the Lodgepole, an event called \\"Ragged Rock\\", by destroying Murmury Well. He takes Ethan to the Summerlands where they meet small Indian-looking people called ferishers. Coyote captures Ethan's father and forces him to create another batch of 'picofiber' to form the hose with which he is going to poison Murmury Well. Ethan enters the Summerlands with fellow baseball team members Thor and Jennifer T. Rideout, in pursuit of his father and to prevent Ragged Rock. On their travels through the Summerlands, the three assemble a baseball team and play their way across the land, meeting players from legend and literature, and a couple from their own world. Mythology Many links to different types of mythology are evident in the novel. The two most prevalent are Norse mythology and Native American mythology. Certain examples are subtly referenced, such as in the name of the Felds' car, Skidbladnir, known in Norse myths as the legendary vehicle of Freyr, so well crafted it can fold up and fit in his pocket. Also, the name of Thor Wignutt is a reference to the Norse god of storms, Thor. Coyote introduces himself as Loki, Norse god of chaos at one point, and the term 'Ragged Rock', meaning the end of the world, translates to the Norse Ragnarok, the final battle in which the world is destroyed and reborn in the Skaldic poems. Finally, the Lodgepole, tree of the worlds, is based on Yggdrasil, the world tree of the Norse, and Murmury Well (the well Coyote means to poison) is Mimir's Well. The Native American mythology is certainly deep and requires in depth study and explanation. The names and actions of Coyote (aka Glooscap, Satan and other monikers), and Raven are of Native American origin, while the legend of La Llorona is Hispanic-American. The tales of the Big Liars are taken from heroes of American folklore: * The Tall Man with the Axe (Paul Bunyan), * The Tall Man with the Big Maul (Joe Magarac), * The Tall Man with the Harpoon (Old Stormalong), * The Tall Man with the Pole (Mike Fink), * The Man with the Knife in His Boot (possibly Stagger Lee), * The Man with the Rattlesnake Necktie (Pecos Bill), * The Tall Man with the Hammer (John Henry), * Annie Christmas (Female Mississippi keelboat pilot), and * Judge Roy Bean, owner of the Jersey Lily Saloon. Also, the \\"big one-eyed bully\\" referenced by Coyote near the end of the book may be a reference to Odin. Chiron Brown (Ringfinger) the scout who recruits Ethan as a hero, is named after the Centaur Chiron (His nickname probably comes from the Hall of Famer Mordecai Brown though); the role of Chiron in the Prometheus myth (Prometheus being one of the masks of Coyote) adds depth and resonance to the character Ringfinger Brown. Chiron's role in finding Ethan is also appropriate as Chiron the centaur was known for training great men and heroes. Old Mr. Wood may be a reference to Odin, who is also known as Woden, which is close to the name Wood. Additionally, in the epilogue, or the section titled \\"Home\\" the baseball that appears in the New Jersey Park signed \\"Van Lingle Mungo\\" is an allusion to the baseball player of the same name. Non- mythological references One of Jennifer T. Rideout's great-aunts is named Aunt Shambleau. \\"Shambleau\\" is a word invented by science fiction writer C.L. Moore, the title of one of her Northwest Smith stories, about sexual addiction; the titular shambleau is a medusa-figure. Aunt Shambleau enforces behavior among her great-nieces and nephews by threatening to take off her dark glasses (although, when in fact she does so, her eyes are no different from those of other humans).

The stadium is owned by the government of Piau√≠ state and is named after Alberto Tavares Silva, who was Piau√≠ governor between 1971 and 1975. History It was built in 1973, and inaugurated on August 26 of that year. Eight people died during mass panic when the stadium's inauguration, which broke out when a spectator shouted that the stadium was collapsing. In reality the vibrations felt were reportedly caused by a low- flying aircraft. Although the death toll in different official reports varies, it is generally accepted that this remains the worst disaster in the history of Brazilian football. The inaugural match was played on August 26, 1973, when Tiradentes and Fluminense drew 0-0.

Sir Frank Lockwood, QC (15 July 1846 ‚Äì 18 December 1897) was an English lawyer and Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons as MP for City of York from 1885 to 1897. Life Lockwood was born in Doncaster, the son of Charles Day Lockwood. His great- grandfather Joseph Lockwood (c. 1758-1837) was twice mayor of Doncaster, and his grandfather was for many years judge on the racecourse.Ward R. D. (2014) Wealth and notability : the Lockwood, Day and Metcalfe families of Yorkshire and London http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/search?title=wealth%20and%20notability&rn;=1 Lockwood was educated at a private school, at Manchester Grammar School, and Caius College, Cambridge. Lockwood was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1872, and joined the old midland circuit, afterwards going to the north-eastern, making in his first year 120 guineas and in the next 265 guineas. From that time he had a career of uninterrupted success, a high-profile brief being the defence of the murderer Charles Peace in 1879. In 1880 was a member of a Royal Commission to enquire into Corrupt Practices at Chester. He was made a Queen's Counsel in 1882 and in 1884 he was made recorder of Sheffield.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 Lockwood made two unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament, the one at King's Lynn at the 1880 general election, the other at York at by-election in 1883.Craig, page 335 He was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for York at the 1885 general election and held the seat until his death in 1897. In 1894 he became solicitor-general in Lord Rosebery's ministry, and was knighted. He was solicitor-general for less than a year. In May 1895 Lockwood was lead counsel for the prosecution in Regina v. Oscar Wilde. The Liberal government seemed determined to get a successful prosecution. Edward Carson, who had successfully defended the Marquess of Queensbury against Wilde's misguided criminal libel, approached Frank Lockwood and asked \\"Can we not let up on the fellow now?\\". Lockwood answered that he would like to do so, but feared that the case had become too politicised to be dropped. In 1896 Lockwood accompanied Lord Chief Justice Russell and barrister Montague Hughes Crackanthorpe to the United States to attend the nineteenth meeting of the American Bar Association as specially invited representatives of the English bar. On the trip he sustained the reputation which he enjoyed in England as a humorous after-dinner speaker, and helped to strengthen the bond of friendship between the bench and bar of the United States and the bench and bar of England. Lockwood's uncle Henry Francis Lockwood was an architect and his father a talented draughtsman. Lockwood also had a skill at drawing, which he used to amuse himself and his friends, by making caricatures in pen and ink, and sketches of humorous incidents, real or imaginary, relating to the topic nearest at hand. He illustrated C. J. Darling's Scintillae Juris in 1889 and contributed to Punch from 1893 to 1897. An exhibition of his work was held in London in March 1889. He was also author of The Law and Lawyers of Pickwick published in 1894. Lockwood lived at Cober Hill, Cloughton, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire. He died in London at the age of 51. Lockwood married Julia Rosetta Salis Schwabe, daughter of Salis and Julia Schwabe of Manchester and Glyn-y-Garth, Anglesey, on 3 September 1874. His wife was the sister of fellow MP George Salis-Schwabe and the daughter of the educationalist Julia Schwabe.Patrick Waddington, ‚ÄòSchwabe, Julie (1818‚Äì1896)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, October 2006 accessed 4 September 2015 Lockwood was the brother-in-law of the 21st MacLean of Lochbuie and there is a small island off the coast of Mull in Scotland near Lochbuie named after him.Baird (1995) p. 142.

It reflects the beginnings of change in the concept of \\"Sly and the Family Stone\\". Formerly a tangible self- contained band, the Family Stone broke up in January 1975 after a disastrous booking at the Radio City Music Hall. At this point, most of the band members parted company with Stone, except for trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, his brother guitarist Freddie Stone, and backup singers Little Sister. With subsequent recordings, Stone returned to using the name of his former band, although they were largely solo recordings. Overview From this point on, each \\"Sly & the Family Stone\\" album would essentially be a Sly Stone solo recording, with contributions from a varying group of collaborators. Sometimes, members of the original Family Stone would participate in the sessions, and sometimes session players and new members would work with Stone as well. For the most part, however, Stone performed a large part of the instrumentation for each song on his own using multitracking (as he had been doing for Family Stone LPs since There's a Riot Goin' On in 1971). This album, like the others, includes a combination of all three types of recordings, plus a handful of songs recorded before the band's dissolution. High on You's first single was the R&B; number- three hit \\"I Get High on You\\". The LP's second single, \\"Le Lo Li\\", failed to chart within the R&B; Top 40, as did the third, \\"Crossword Puzzle\\". All three singles missed the U.S. pop Top 40. Besides its standard stereo release, High on You was also released in quadraphonic sound. The album prominently features vocalist Rudy Love.

Upon discovery of an official cover agent's secret hostile role, the host nation often declares the agent persona non grata and orders them to leave the country. Official cover operatives are granted a set of governmental protections, and if caught in the act of espionage, they can request diplomatic protection from their government.

Located in Budapest, it is a busy institution, with over 200 operas each calendar year, on top of extensive educational programs, ballet, and musical theatre. The company employs 150 singers, a 200 member orchestra, and a 200 member chorus. Performances take place in the Hungarian State Opera House and the Erkel Theatre. In recent years, the company has also courted controversy, both in choices of casting, and in succumbing to public pressure to end scheduled productions early.  History  = Origin = Gianni Schicchi (Hungarian State Opera House) The Hungarian State Opera, or the Royal Hungarian Opera, as it was known until 1945, was founded in 1884 in Budapest. Its first director was Hungarian conductor and composer Ferenc Erkel, whose name now graces the second performance space that the company occupies. The first performance of the company included the first act of B√°nk b√°n by Erkel (considered to be an important, patriotic Hungarian opera), and the first act of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin. From the beginning, the Hungarian State Opera was a large institution, initially employing a total of 475 people, including performers, orchestra players, and varying administrative staff. The Opera House itself, however, was undersized in terms of the number of seats, leading to a shortfall in operating income within the first few years of the company's existence. The shortfall was made up by a significant annual gift from the King. It is suggested that this gift led to the government having an outsized say in all matters related to company operations. Early audiences were made up of the aristocracy and other elites, who did not require excellence of the art on stage. Rather, it was considered a social club. = Gustav Mahler = In 1888, only four years after the company's founding, a 28-year-old Gustav Mahler became Artistic Director, at a time when the company was on shaky ground, financially, having laid off a quarter of its staff. It seemed an unlikely choice for a Hungarian company, being that Mahler was German, Jewish, with very little experience. Despite this, two of the purported goals under Mahler's leadership was to both make the company a national voice of Hungary, and also to eventually create a homegrown ensemble of Hungarian singers. Mahler did not complete these objectives in the two years he led the company. However, his short stint still led to the first period of acknowledged artistic excellence for the company. Further, it is acknowledged that Mahler's work in Budapest laid the groundwork for his best known post, that of leading the Vienna State Opera. = Bluebeard's Castle = B√©la Bart√≥k's Bluebeard's Castle is his most famous opera work. Initially entered into a Hungarian opera writing competition in 1911, it failed to gain popularity with the Hungarian music public. It is suggested that this is because its musical qualities were significantly different from the Italian and German opera that was at the center of Hungarian tastes, at the time. Nevertheless, Bluebeard's Castle eventually had its world premiere with the Hungarian State Opera Company in 1918, only to have the work banned in 1919 until the late 1930s, because of the forced exile of librettist B√©la Bal√°zs. = Modern day = The opera company today is guided under the leadership of Szilveszter √ìkov√°cs, who was appointed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n. The company has enjoyed significant investment from the Hungarian government in recent years, in the amount of hundreds of millions of dollars, including funds to renovate the Opera House for the first time since World War I. There has been much comparison drawn between the far right political leadership of Orban and Donald Trump in the United States, but one significant difference has been each of their approaches to governmental funding to cultural institutions. Whereas Trump attempted to significantly cut funding to the National Endowment for the Arts, Orban has both increased funding to cultural institutions, and also put in place handpicked leaders of those very institutions.  Controversies  In recent years, there have been at least two instances of controversy surrounding productions of the Hungarian State Opera: a production of the musical Billy Elliott that was cut short, and shortly thereafter, an all-white casting of Porgy and Bess. = Billy Elliott = In June 2018, 15 performances of Billy Elliott were cancelled after a right-wing, pro-Orban website published an op-ed that Billy Elliot was targeting young people, and pushing pro-homosexual propaganda. The op-ed was promptly picked up by other right wing media members, and a short while later the performances were cancelled. The opera company, however, claimed the cancellations were caused by a drop in ticket sales caused by the negative publicity, not the publicity itself. = Porgy and Bess = Later in 2018, Hungarian State Opera generated controversy by the announcement of a mostly all-white production of Porgy and Bess, composed by George Gershwin. Porgy and Bess has been traditionally performed by an all-black ensemble, as its writers intended. Their production moved the story from Catfish Row in Charleston, South Carolina, to an airplane hangar, reframing it as a story about refugees. In order to perform the opera in the manner they did, Hungarian State Opera, as part of the agreement with Tams-Witmark, the licensor of the work, had to print \\"unauthorised [and] contrary to the requirements for the presentation of the work' on all of its marketing materials. Some cultural critics saw the staging as part of an effort to drum up support for Viktor Orban, with the next Hungarian general election upcoming. √Åd√°m Fischer, a prominent Hungarian conductor, described the production as being done in bad faith and political in its intent: \\"It's part of the whole election campaign against what they see as the double standards of the west and to allow them to say the west is racist and we are better than the west. Why else would Hungarian state opera stage a production of Porgy and Bess two months before the election?\\" In opposition to these remarks, opera company director √ìkov√°cs said that the rumor that Viktor Orban was somehow connected to the production was false, and that he had not seen it. He described the controversy thusly: \\"There was really silly fake news about our Porgy production.\\" While the production drew anger from foreign critics, Hungarian critics largely praised the work. An Orban-friendly website, Origo, said: \\"Only blacks used to be able to perform this opera because of racist restrictions.\\" Another conservative columnist: \\"Political correctness is slowly devouring aesthetics.\\" Not all foreign critics saw the idea of a non-black Porgy and Bess as inherently bad. Years before the Hungarian production, Anthony Tommasini argued in The New York Times that opera has never been concerned with appearance to suggest authenticity - he notes that people were accepting of Luciano Pavarotti as a starving French artist. He goes on to quote African-American opera singer Simon Estes, who said, \\"This may sound extreme, but I think it's almost unconstitutional for Porgy and Bess to be performed only by black artists.\\" He notes many casting choices where race was not part of the consideration. If what he calls \\"nontraditional casting\\" is going to be used at all, it has to be applied to all operas, even one with the specific kind of stipulations attached to it as Porgy and Bess has. The Hungarian State Opera did Porgy and Bess for nearly 150 performances in the 1970s with a mostly white cast, performing in blackface.

Museum I-OKM-2010 The L√ºbeck law () was the family of codified municipal law developed at L√ºbeck, which became a free imperial city in 1226 and is located in present day Schleswig-Holstein. It was the second most prevalent form of municipal law in medieval and early modern Germany next to the Magdeburg Law. L√ºbeck Law provided for municipal self-government and self-administration yet did not negate dependance upon a lord, be it a bishop, duke, king or, in L√ºbeck's case, an emperor. Instead, it allowed the cities a certain degree of autonomy and self-reliance in legislative, judicial and executive matters. While these authorities were vested in the city council (Rat), the members of which could be elected by co-option, the L√ºbeck Law represents a significant modernization of governance in that a class of burghers, as opposed to nobles, were responsible for the day to day affairs of governing. The L√ºbeck Law is not analogous to Hanseatic law. Hanseatic cities adopted either L√ºbeck or Madgeburg law. History L√ºbeck set about spreading its form of government to other cities around the Baltic Sea. Eventually about 100 adopted a government based on the law. It still serves as a foundation for German town laws in many of those cities. Later in the 13th century, cities predominantly governed by the L√ºbeck Law formed into a powerful trade association, the Hanseatic League, which amounted to a quasi-confederacy with headquarters at L√ºbeck. However, by the 15th century, major kontore and smaller trading posts of the Hanse, which was then at the high point of its influence, spread throughout northern Central Europe and the British Isles, from London to Veliky Novgorod and from Trondheim to Frankfurt, dominating trade far beyond German-speaking regions and also far beyond the cities where L√ºbeck law was in force. The earliest Latin manuscript transmitting the Lubeck law dates to 1226, the oldest Middle Low German manuscript to 1270. The earliest reference to a L√ºbeck law manuscript is attributed to 1188. The L√ºbeck law is influenced by the merchants from Westphalia who settled L√ºbeck as well as by the Holstein land law and the Schleswig Law. L√ºbeck law was prevalent throughout cities in Northern and Northeastern Germany (Niederdeutschland) until 1900, when the modern German civil code (B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch) was implemented. Main principle The L√ºbeck law provided that a city should be governed by a Rat (Council), having 20 Ratsherrn (council members). They were not elected by the citizens, but they would appoint a new member on their own from the city's merchant guilds. This was considered a key to representation of the guilds in the Rat of the city. The period of office was in principle 2 years, but the Rat could ask a Ratsherr to stay in office, which usually happened, so that the election was effectively for life. The Rat elected up to four B√ºrgermeister (burgomaster, mayor) from its members, who shared the power of government. The \\"first burgomaster\\", usually the eldest of them, acted as a primus inter pares. These rules were in force up to the middle of the 19th century. The burgomasters stayed in office as long as they could. There are several examples from the Middle Ages in which burgomasters of Hanseatic League cities were sentenced to death for unsuccessful politics. This model of a city government provided that only the most experienced, influential and personally most successful merchants - and a few lawyers, called Syndics - became members of the Rat. It was also a rule that a father and his son, or brothers, could never be members of the Rat at the same time, so that influential families could not get too large a share of influence on the city's politics.

St Day is located in a former mining area (which included Poldice, Tolcarne, Todpool, Creegbrawse and Crofthandy) and accrued considerable wealth from mining. The parish is at the heart of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, a World Heritage Site that includes St Agnes, Chapel Porth and Porthtowan.  Industrial history  St Day was a centre for the richest and perhaps most famous copper mining district in the world from the 16th century to the 1830s. The population, wealth and activity in St Day declined steadily from about 1870 onwards, today the population is smaller than in 1841. It is now essentially a residential village. The Wheal Gorland mine is the type locality for the minerals: clinoclase, cornwallite and liroconite.

Club's nickname, El Torito (The Little Bull) is an allusion to 1930s legendary boxer Justo Su√°rez, known as El Torito de Mataderos (The Little Bull of Mataderos). The club is mostly known for its football team, that currently plays in the Primera B Nacional, the second division of the Argentine football league system. Other sports practised at the club are basketball, boxing, field hockey, futsal, handball, roller skating and volleyball. History On 1 July 1911, a group of young people from 15 to 30 years old, met in a public park, more specifically on the wooden bridge located in the corner of Tellier and Francisco Bilbao Streets, to form a football team. The name chosen was \\"Los Unidos de Nueva Chicago\\",\\"Iniciaci√≥n de Nueva Chicago\\" ‚Äì Pueblo de Chicago website naming Pedro San Mart√≠n as President, along with Felipe Maglio as Vice-President. The club's activities started on an empty lot located behind a slaughterhouse. There were many proposals to define the team colours. Some wished to adopt the colours from Alumni, red and white; others suggested to use Racing Club colors, light blue and white. During their discussion, a truck loaded with bundles which had green and black colours went pass the Campana (today Crovara) Avenue. Those colours were immediately adopted as club colours. The club executives worked intensively in getting a field where to play. Alejandro Morh, a Mercado de Hacienda manager, donated the land where the first field was established. But it lasted a short time due to the flood waters that cross under the field. Nueva Chicago was given a land on Tellier and Francisco Bilbao Avenues. The team played there from 1912 to 1920. The third field was located on Piedrabuena and Campana (currently Eva Per√≥n) avenues. That was the field where Chicago played its first games in Primera Divisi√≥n and opened in June 1920 when the team defeated Hurac√°n by 2‚Äì0. In this field, Nueva Chicago would also win the Copa de Competencia Jockey Club in 1933, its first title in Primera Divisi√≥n. When football became professional in Argentina, the Football Association did not authorise to play official matches there, so Nueva Chicago had to play in other stadiums. Three years later the land were expropriated to build a hospital. Primera B championship, in 1930.

In 1937 Nueva Chicago was relegated to the second division after Banfield defeated Excursionistas. Then president of the club Amadeo Cozza made an agreement with Sportivo Buenos Aires so the team hosted their home games at that stadium, then located in Almagro, Buenos Aires. By 1939 Nueva Chicago played its home games at All Boys stadium. That same year the club made the arrangements to get a new field where to build a stadium. The Municipality of Buenos Aires donated the club a land where a dump had operated. A group of club members and neighborhoods collaborated to level the playing field until it was in conditions to host games. The stadium was inaugurated on 27 October 1940 vs. Sportivo Buenos Aires, which was defeated by 2‚Äì0. The team celebrated not only the victory but its second local title, the Primera C championship. Nueva Chicago has been playing at that stadium since then. In 1966 Nueva Chicago was near to promote to Primera Divisi√≥n but the team lost the final match to Deportivo Espa√±ol, remaining in the second division. Nueva Chicago would not play in the top division of Argentine football until 1981, when it won its second Primera B title. The team played 22 matches, with 14 draws and 6 losses. Chicago also scored 66 goals and conceded 40. In Primera Divisi√≥n, the team's highlight was an outstanding win against Boca Juniors by 5‚Äì0, on 2 November 1983.\\"La noche en que Chicago le hizo 5 goles a Boca\\", Clar√≠n, 13 April 2002Nueva Chicago 5 ‚Äì Boca Juniors 0 at Historia de Boca.com Despite this historic fact, the team was relegated at the end of the season.

The first game was won by Tigre by 1‚Äì0. Next match was played on 25 June 2007. When Tigre was leading Nueva Chicago by 2‚Äì1 (and therefore sending it to Primera B Nacional) hundreds of Chicago's hooligans jumped into the field without being stopped by the police (although there were 200 police officers in the stadium), taking off the uniforms to players and then attacking Tigre's supporters which were peacefully celebrating their return to Primera Divisi√≥n.

Moreover, the Government of Argentina closed Chicago stadium for 20 fixtures, therefore the team could not play at its venue during all 2007‚Äì08 season and had to use other stadiums, mainly the Argentinos Juniors and Ferro Carril Oeste facilities. Nueva Chicago totalized 52 points that finally were 34 (when the deduction of 18 points was applied), which forced the team to play the Promoci√≥n again, facing Los Andes. The team from Lomas de Zamora won both matches (1‚Äì0 and 2‚Äì0), relegating Nueva Chicago to Primera B Metropolitana, the third division of Argentine football.

According to Paolo Padovani, ‚ÄúThis discovery means that surveys of powerful supermassive black holes have so far underestimated their numbers by at least a factor of two, and possibly by up to a factor of five.‚Äù According to Peter Quinn, director of the AVO, the virtual observatory observations are the future of astronomy and will facilitate more discoveries in the future.\\" In 2018 Padovani was involved in the association between IceCube neutrinos and the blazar TXS 0506+956 at redshift = 0.3365 ESO Blog. This blazar is the first non-stellar neutrino source, as the only astronomical sources previously observed by neutrino detectors were the Sun and supernova 1987A, which were detected decades earlier at much lower neutrino energies. In July 2019 Padovani was awarded the ‚ÄúSparlamento Prize in Research and Development 2019‚Äù for his contribution to enhancing Italian excellence in astronomy. The ceremony took place on 5 July 2019, at the Italian House of Parliament in Rome ‚Äî the first time ever an astronomical ceremony was held in the building ESO Announcement.

History and organization The CRC is one of the ten UN human rights treaty-based bodies. The Committee was created by the Convention on 27 February 1991. The Committee is made up of 18 members from different countries and legal systems who are of 'high moral standing' and experts in the field of human rights. Although members are nominated and elected by States party to the Convention, Committee members act in a personal capacity. They do not represent their countries' governments or any other organization to which they might belong. Members are elected for a four-year term and can be re-elected if nominated. The 195 states that have ratified the Convention (\\"States party to the Convention\\") (which includes all UN member states except Somalia and the United States, South Sudan ratified on 23 January 2015) are required to submit initial and periodic reports on the national situation of children's rights to the Committee for examination. The Committee examines each report and raises concerns or makes recommendations to the State party. It also issues occasional general comments on the interpretation of particular Convention obligations. Once a year, the Committee submits a report to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which also hears a statement from the CRC Chair, and the Assembly adopts a Resolution on the Rights of the Child.Child Rights Information Network (2008).

They play in the Elite One Championship. The club was formed in 1958. They have won the French rugby league championship on four occasions and lifted the Lord Derby Cup three times. Their home ground is the Stade Jules Ribet. History The club was founded in 1958 as Racing Club Saint-Gaudinois Comminges XIII. It was during the 1960s and early 1970s that they enjoyed their best spell. Having been runners up in the league on four occasions 1963, 66, 67 and 69 they finally won it in 1970 when they beat the favourites XIII Catalan 33-10. Two more runners up spots in 1971 and 72 showed that they were consistent if not successful. In 1973 they lifted the cup in their first appearance in the final, beating AS Carcassonne on their own ground 22-8. The following season brought more silverware when they won the title again. There then followed a lean period, in fact it would be 27 years before any more success occurred but in that season of 1990-91 they registered a league and cup double. In the cup they beat Pia XIII 30-4 and the league was won thanks to a 10-8 win against US Villeneuve. They retained the cup the following season beating RC Carpentras 22-10 in the final. The league title was won again in 2004 a year after finishing runner up. The 2004 final in Perpignan was won against Union Treiziste Catalane 14-10. A steady decline began after this and the club finished bottom of the league in both 2009 and 2010 escaping relegation but in 2011 the club was relegated to the Elite Two Championship After five seasons in the 2nd tier they were promoted back to the top division when the league was increased.http://www.rugbyaxiiistgaudens.com  Stadium  The club have always played at the Stade Jules Ribet.

The company's products commonly referred to as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or firmware support and enable the compatibility, connectivity, security and management of the various components and technologies used in such devices. Phoenix Technologies and IBM developed the El Torito standard. Phoenix was incorporated in Massachusetts in September 1979, and its headquarters are in Pasadena, California. History In 1979, Neil Colvin formed what was then called Phoenix Software Associates after his prior employer, Xitan, went out of business. Neil hired Dave Hirschman, a former Xitan employee. During 1980‚Äì1981, they rented office space for the first official Phoenix location at 151 Franklin Street, Boston, Massachusetts. In this same time period Phoenix purchased a non-exclusive license for Seattle Computer Products 86-DOS. Phoenix developed customized versions of 86-DOS (or sometimes called PDOS for Phoenix DOS) for various microprocessor platforms. Phoenix also provided PMate as a replacement for Edlin as the DOS file editor. Phoenix also developed C language libraries, called PForCe, along with Plink-86/Plink-86plus, overlay linkers, and Pfix-86, a windowed Debugger for DOS. These products only provided a small revenue stream to Phoenix during the early 1980s and the company did not significantly expand in size. =Cloning the IBM PC BIOS= After the success of the IBM PC, many companies began making PC clones. Some, like Compaq, developed their own compatible ROM BIOS, but others violated copyright by directly copying the PC's BIOS from the IBM PC Technical Reference Manual. After Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. IBM sued companies that it claimed infringed IBM's copyright. Clone manufacturers needed a legal, fully compatible BIOS. To develop a legal BIOS, Phoenix used a clean room design. Engineers read the BIOS source listings in the IBM PC Technical Reference Manual. They wrote technical specifications for the BIOS APIs for a single, separate engineer‚Äîone with experience programming the Texas Instruments TMS9900, not the Intel 8088 or 8086‚Äîwho had not been exposed to IBM BIOS source code. The single engineer developed code to mimic the BIOS APIs. By recording the audit trail of the two groups' interactions, Phoenix developed a defensibly non-infringing IBM PC compatible ROM BIOS. Because the programmers who wrote the Phoenix code never read IBM's reference manuals, nothing they wrote could have been copied from IBM's code, no matter how closely the two matched. This reverse engineering technique is commonly referred to as a \\"Chinese wall\\". The first Phoenix PC ROM BIOS was introduced in May 1984, which enabled OEMs such as Hewlett-Packard, Tandy Corporation, and AT&T; Computer Systems to build essentially 100%-compatible clones without having to reverse-engineer the PC BIOS themselves as Compaq had.Phoenix Eagerly Waiting to Clone Next-Generation IBM BIOS, InfoWorld, March 9, 1987 Phoenix licensed the BIOS to clone makers for $290,000. To reassure customers, the company obtained a $2 million insurance policy from The Hartford against copyright-infringement lawsuits. Phoenix's revenues grew by 100% in 1987, and the company shifted to licensing the BIOS on a per-machine basis instead of a flat fee. Competitors appeared, such as AMI BIOS. Phoenix shipped an IBM PC/AT-compatible BIOS six months after the computer's announcement, and also developed IBM Personal System/2 Micro Channel-compatible BIOS, including the ABIOS, and EISA compatible BIOS during 1988 and 1989. =1987‚Äì1989= In 1987, Phoenix began the first of many expansion, acquisition, and collapse cycles. It acquired Softstyle, Inc, and Softset, Inc, and began a printer emulation product line, and a Phoenix publishing division. Phoenix also tripled the number of employees from late 1986 to 1989. Phoenix launched an IPO in June 1988 and made the founder and early employees instant millionaires on paper. The stock price did not sustain its peak of 18¬æ, and by late 1989 it had plummeted to 3¬æ. In addition, the company posted a loss of $7.7 million in 1989, due primarily to the consolidation of the PC market, and Phoenix's unsuccessful branching out into collateral markets. In December 1989, Ron Fisher took over as CEO, and again the company focused on the core PC BIOS products, and prevented a hostile takeover bid by Norwood Partners Limited Partnership. =1990s= Phoenix Bios, 1999 By 1992, Phoenix was financially healthy enough to start another expansion and acquisition cycle. In January 1992, Phoenix acquired Quadtel, a leading BIOS supplier. The Quadtel BIOS code base was newer than the original Phoenix ROM BIOS code base, and the development effort switched to the Quadtel products. It was rebranded as PhoenixBIOS. The original ROM BIOS code base was used on a joint development effort with David Keenan at IBM (called SurePath), but Phoenix did no further development work on the original code. Phoenix also expanded its presence in foreign markets. In 1993 Phoenix acquired SRI KK, a Phoenix distributor, and formed the Phoenix KK Japanese subsidiary. In addition, the offices in Taipei, and Europe were expanded in size. In 1994, Phoenix acquired Guildford, Surrey, UK-based DIP Research Ltd. and continued to expand European operations, who had previously developed the DIP DOS operating system for the DIP Pocket PC aka Atari Portfolio in 1989. In 1996, Phoenix acquired Virtual Chips, Inc., a maker of synthesizable cores for PC peripherals, and Mountain View, California-based Award Software in 1998. Due to these expansions, Phoenix reduced its global work force by 5% by ending 38 jobs.\\"PHOENIX TO CUT 38 JOBS, TAKE CHARGE FOR RESTRUCTURE..\\" Computergram International. =2001‚Äì2003= Phoenix continued to grow steadily from the late 1990s, and saw a significant increase in revenues from the Y2K product refreshes in the PC industry. However, by mid-2001, the PC industry suffered another downturn, and Phoenix was forced to reduce the less profitable product lines, such as the IA-64 effort, and close a number of redundant offices. Phoenix again focused on the core BIOS business for the next few years. During late 2002 and 2003, Phoenix began to develop specialized firmware-based applications. These applications often had components embedded in the BIOS that allowed them to function in damaged PC systems. These included security applications for password hiding and authentication, PC backup and recovery applications, and basic diagnostic applications. Several applications were obtained through complete acquisitions of other companies, such as the SPEKE technology from Integrity Sciences, or the browser technology from Ravisent. The PC BIOS business continued its steady, but slow, growth despite a rapidly declining unit price. The Award product line was focused on the low-margin, high volume Desktop product line, while the Phoenix TrustedCore BIOS was primarily successful in the high-end PC systems, and Servers. The revenues from the BIOS business continued to provide the capital to invest further in the applications business. =2005‚Äì2008= By late 2005, it became clear that the BIOS revenues could not sustain the losses incurred by the applications business. The BIOS revenue stream was heavily leveraged through fully paid-up licenses, and by early 2006 this business model was no longer sustainable. Phoenix announced some of the largest losses in the company history, and went through another consolidation cycle. Several offices were closed and over 70% of the employees were laid off. By late 2006, after senior management changes, the company refocused on the PC BIOS business and the couple of potentially profitable applications. In September, the company named Woodson \\"Woody\\" Hobbs as president and CEO of Phoenix Technologies. Hobbs had a history of turning struggling companies around. According to company documents, \\"prior to joining Phoenix, Hobbs served as president and CEO of Intellisync Corporation from 2002 until the company's acquisition by Nokia in February 2006. Under Hobbs' leadership, Intellisync became the number two wireless email company, increased its stock price by nearly ten times, and grew enterprise value from zero to over $430 million.\\"http://investor.phoenix.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=210260 By January 2008, Phoenix had posted higher-than-expected Q1 revenues and increased full year guidance.http://investor.phoenix.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=284884 In 2008, Phoenix also acquired several companies: * In May, Phoenix acquired BeInSync, Ltd., an Israeli-based provider of an all-in-one solution that allows users to back up, synchronize, share and access data online.http://investor.phoenix.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=307684 Although Phoenix did not disclose the amount of the transaction, according to at least one online report, Phoenix acquired BeInSync for $25 million. * In July, in an effort to develop a strong online presence and infrastructure for web-based automated service delivery, Phoenix acquired TouchStone Software Corporation for its online PC diagnostics and software update technology, eSupport.com this included the recently purchased HijackPro and Drivermagic software from Glenn Bluff.eSupport.com this included the recently purchased HijackPro and Drivermagic software from Glenn Bluff The net value of the transaction was approximately $17 million.http://investor.phoenix.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=319106 * In September, Phoenix acquired General Software of Bellevue, WA, to extend its firmware leadership to a wide array of specialized high-value, high-margin devices that use embedded processors (embedded systems), from mobile and consumer electronics to data communications.http://investor.phoenix.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=331506 =2009‚Äì2010= In 2009, Phoenix shut down their Engineering and Sales offices in Shanghai and Nanjing, China. Phoenix also laid off most of the staff in those offices, although some of the managers were moved to other offices in Taiwan. Phoenix opened a new office in Bangalore, India and closed its office in Hyderabad, India. Most of the Hyderabad employees were given the option to move to the new Bangalore office. In late Q4 2009, Phoenix began exploring strategic alternatives for the products it had developed and purchased in its prior acquisition phase. On January 5, 2010, Phoenix announced it had hired GrowthPoint Technology partners to find alternative business strategies for the FailSafe, HyperSpace and eSupport.com products and would aim to refocus its business strategy on BIOS where it still retained a substantial majority of its revenue. On April 9, 2010 it was announced that Absolute Software would pay $6.9 million for Phoenix Technologies security technologies, including FailSafe and Freeze. On June 12, 2010 it was announced that Hewlett-Packard would be purchasing Phoenix Technologies' instant-on operating system technologies, including HyperSpace, HyperCore and Flip.

I., Polubarinov I. V. (1967). Sov. J. Nucl. Phys. 4. 156 (Yad. Fiz 4, 216). The adjective \\"NS\\" reflects the fact that in the RNS formalism, these fields appear in the NS‚ÄìNS sector in which all vector fermions are anti-periodic. Both uses of the word \\"NS\\" refer to Andr√© Neveu and John Henry Schwarz, who studied such boundary conditions (the so-called Neveu‚ÄìSchwarz boundary conditions) and the fields that satisfy them in 1971. Details The Kalb‚ÄìRamond field generalizes the electromagnetic potential but it has two indices instead of one. This difference is related to the fact that the electromagnetic potential is integrated over one-dimensional worldlines of particles to obtain one of its contributions to the action while the Kalb‚ÄìRamond field must be integrated over the two-dimensional worldsheet of the string. In particular, while the action for a charged particle moving in an electromagnetic potential is given by : -q\\\\int dx^\\\\mu A_\\\\mu that for a string coupled to the Kalb‚ÄìRamond field has the form : -\\\\int dx^\\\\mu dx^ u B_{\\\\mu u} This term in the action implies that the fundamental string of string theory is a source of the NS‚ÄìNS B-field, much like charged particles are sources of the electromagnetic field. The Kalb‚ÄìRamond field appears, together with the metric tensor and dilaton, as a set of massless excitations of a closed string.

Strictly speaking, it is not a missal: It has been described as a breviary-missal. It can also be described as a Liber Mysticus or Breviarum gothicum.

This is most commonly done with Khmer proper nouns such as names of people and geographical names, as in a gazetteer. Romanization systems for Khmer Cambodian geographical names are often romanized with a transliteration system, where representations in the Khmer script are mapped regularly to representations in the Latin alphabet (sometimes with some additional diacritics). The results do not always reflect standard Khmer pronunciation, as no special treatment is given to unpronounced letters and irregular pronunciations, although the two registers of Khmer vowel symbols are often taken into account. When transcription is used, words are romanized based on their pronunciation. However, pronunciation of Khmer can vary by speaker and region. Roman transcription of Khmer is often done ad hoc on Internet forums and chatrooms, the results sometimes being referred to as Khmenglish or Khmerlish. These ad hoc romanizations are usually based on English pronunciations of letters, although they may also be influenced by Khmer spelling (as with the use of s rather than h to represent a final aspirate). Since some sounds can be represented by more than one symbol in Khmer orthography, it is not generally possible to recover the original Khmer spelling from a pronunciation-based Roman transcription. Even transliteration systems often do not preserve all of the distinctions made in the Khmer script. Some of the more commonly used romanization systems for Khmer are listed below. For full details of the various systems, see the links given in the External Links section. =UNGEGN= The Khmer romanization scheme published by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names is based on the BGN/PCGN system, described below. It is used for Cambodian geographical names in some recent maps and gazetteers, although the Geographic Department's modified system (see below) has come into use in the country since 1995.Report on the Current Status of United Nations Romanization Systems for Geographical Names ‚Äì Khmer, UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization Systems, September 2013 (linked from WGRS website). Correspondences in the UNGEGN system are detailed in the Khmer alphabet article. =Geographic Department= The Geographic Department of the Cambodian Ministry of Land Management and Urban Planning has developed a modified version of the UNGEGN system,Geographical Names of the Kingdom of Cambodia, submitted by Cambodia to the 8th UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, 2002 (also addendum with corrections). originally put forward in 1995, and used in the second edition of the Gazetteer of Cambodia in 1996. Further modifications were made in 1997, and the system continues to be used in Cambodia. The main change made in this system compared with the UNGEGN system is that diacritics on vowels are omitted. Some of the vowels are also represented using different letter combinations. =BGN/PCGN= A system used by the United States Board on Geographic Names and the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use, published in 1972. It is based on the modified 1959 Service G√©ographique Khmer (SGK) system.Romanization System for Khmer (Cambodian), BGN/PCGN 1972 System. =ALA-LC Romanization Tables= This system (also called Transliteration System for Khmer Script), from the American Library Association and Library of Congress,ALA-LC Romanization Tables, Khmer, rev. 2012. romanizes Khmer words using the original Indic values of the Khmer letters, which are totally different from their modern values. This can obscure the modern Khmer pronunciation, but the system has the advantage of relative simplicity, and facilitates the etmylogical reconstruction of Sanskrit and Pali loanwords whose pronunciation may be different in modern Khmer. The system is a modification of that proposed by Lewitz (1969), and was developed by Franklin Huffman of Cornell University and Edwin Bonsack of the Library of Congress for the library cataloguing of publications in Khmer. International Phonetic Alphabet transcription Various authors have used systems based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to transcribe Khmer. One such system is used in the books of Franklin E. Huffman and others;For example, Franklin E. Huffman, Cambodian System of Writing and Beginning Reader with Drills and Glossary, Adam Wood, 1970 (downloadable PDF). a more recent scheme is that used in J.M. Filippi's 2004 textbook Everyday Khmer or Khmer au quotidien.Jean Michel Filippi, Everyday Khmer, Funan, Phnom Penh , 2004. French edition: Filippi et al., Khmer au quotidien, Librairie You-Feng, 2008. These systems differ in certain respects: for example, Huffman's uses doubling of vowel symbols to indicate long vowels, whereas Filippi's uses the IPA triangular colon vowel length symbol.

Billard was previously a teacher of the year recipient in 2012, when fully employed by Catholic, until his resign the same year. On October 25, 2014, of which just weeks before North Carolina's same-sex marriage law was eliminated, Billard posted his wedding announcement on Facebook. The lawsuit states that on Christmas Day he was fired as a sub at CCHS. On January 9, 2015, Billard informed Charlotte Media of his termination from Catholic.

The diocese refused to release a statement to the media concerning the events, as the case is still pending.The Charlotte Observer http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/education/article125835989.html =Sister Jane Dominic Speech= On March 21, 2014, Charlotte Catholic welcomed Sister Jane Dominic Laurel, a Dominican Nun trained at the Pontifical University, to give a speech on Catholic beliefs on gender roles. During the speech, Sister Jane Dominic suggested that masturbation and pornography can lead young adults to become homosexuals and that children raised in single parent homes have a greater likelihood to grow up to be gay. Students and parents were not told ahead of time of the content of her speech. An online petition written by Charlotte Catholic alumni Emma Winters(c/o 2014) against the content of her speech garnered 2000 signatures and a letter-writing campaign to the Dioceses of Charlotte and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was initiated. Shortly thereafter, a counter petition was written by Charlotte Catholic alumni Jack Denton(c/o 2017) which defended the dignity of Sister Jane Dominic Laurel since it had come under attack after her lecture. It garnered over 2500 signatures. A parents meeting held by the high school later in the week to discuss the speech attracted nearly a thousand people and the meeting went over an hour longer than scheduled due to the number of parents who wished to ask questions or make comments.The Charlotte Observer http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9109553.html The speech and fallout received national media attention.USA Today https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/03/catholic-nun- homosexuality-speech/7250825/ The Dioceses of Charlotte and Bishop Peter Jugis continued to support the teachings of Sister Jane Dominic and she was vigorously supported by Catholic media. In early April, Sister Jane Dominic cancelled all of her scheduled speaking events and took a sabbatical from her teaching position at Aquinas College.The Charlotte Observer http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/article9110582.html The President of Aquinas College stated that in her speech Sister Jane Dominic ‚Äúspoke clearly on matters of faith and morals‚Äù but ‚Äúher deviation into realms of sociology and anthropology was beyond the scope of her expertise.‚Äù =Vaping= On November 17, 2017, Charlotte Catholic announced that disciplinary measures would include the prohibition of vaping devices and letters were sent home on this issue.

The Dingbats debuted in 1st Issue Special #6 (September 1975), and were created by Jack Kirby. Publication history According to inker Mike Royer, The Dingbats of Danger Street was developed as a new series, but the series was cancelled and the first issue repurposed as an issue of 1st Issue Special. In this issue the Dingbats (at least partly by accident) stop the villains Jumpin' Jack and the Gasser with the help of Lieutenant Terry Mullins. Kirby drew two further issues which were not scripted or inked. The Dingbats reappear in The Adventures of Superman, one of a number of Kirby homages by Karl Kesel. They first appear in brief cameos, but are subsequently seen in full in The Adventures of Superman #549, in which they compete with the Newsboy Legion and the Green Team for a disused theatre. Kesel explained that he was a fan of the Newsboy Legion, and brought in the other two boy groups as a counterpoint to the Newsboys, since all three were created by Joe Simon and/or Jack Kirby. He added: \\"As much as I love Kirby's work overall, I can't say I have any special fondness for the Dingbats - they served their story purpose as a counterpoint to the Newsboys, but it wasn't like I was hoping we'd get a Dingbats mini out of their appearance\\".

Biography He was born at Noordwijk, in the province of Holland. Dousa's parents, Johan van der Does, lord of Noordwijk, and Anna van Nijenrode died when their son was only five years old. Dousa was placed under the guardianship of his grandfather Frans van Nijenrode until his death in 1560 and later of his uncle Werner van der Does, lord of Kattendijke. He began his studies at Lier in Brabant, became a pupil of Henry Junius at Delft in 1560, and then passed on in succession to Louvain, Douai and Paris. Here he studied Greek under Jean Dorat, professor at the College Royal, and became acquainted with the chancellor L'Hopital, Adrianus Turnebus, Pierre de Ronsard and other eminent men. On his return in 1565 he married Elizabeth van Zuylen. Dousa was a member of the lower nobility. From his father he inherited the lordship of Noordwijk, from his uncle Werner the lordship of Kattendijke. He returned to his estates in 1566, the year of the iconoclastic fury, when the Low Countries were on the threshold of a new period in their history: the Dutch Revolt. He was not, however, at first very eager to commit himself to the fortunes of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, but having once chosen his side, he threw himself heart and soul into the struggle for freedom from the Spanish yoke. In his lordships Dousa adopted a moderate policy of religious tolerance: both Catholicism and Protestantism were allowed. As a member of the nobility he joined the ‚ÄòVerbond der Edelen,‚Äô the confederation of noblemen against the religious policy of Philip II of Spain. In 1570 he became ‚Äòhoogheemraad‚Äô (inspector of the dikes) and a member of the States of Holland on behalf of the nobility. When in 1572 the Revolt formally began with the first independent meeting of the States-General, Dousa joined it. In the same year he participated in an embassy to queen Elizabeth I of England to ask for support against Spain. Fortunately for Leiden, he was residing in the town at the time of the famous siege. He held no post in the government, but in the hour of need he, though not trained to arms, took the command of a company of troops. His own resolution encouraged the regents and citizens to prolong the defense. On the foundation of the Leiden University by William the Silent, Dousa was appointed first curator, and he held this office for nearly thirty years. Through his friendships with foreign scholars, he drew to Leiden many illustrious teachers and professors. After the assassination of the Prince of Orange in 1584, Dousa undertook a private journey to England to try and persuade Queen Elizabeth to support the cause of the states, and in 1585 he went at the head of a formal embassy for the same purpose. She refused to accept the sovereignty of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, because she did not want to risk a war with Spain, but she was willing to send Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, with a small army, to lend support. About the same time Dousa was appointed keeper of the archive of Holland (registermeester van Holland), and the opportunities thus afforded him of historical research he turned to good account. In 1591 he was appointed a justice in the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland which he remained till his death. He died at Noordwijk and was interred at the Hague; but no monument was erected to his memory until 1792, when one of his descendants placed a tomb to his honour in the church of Noordwyck. There are good portraits of the Great Dousa, as he is often called, by Visscher and Houbraken. =Family= He had twelve children, but only nine of them, seven sons and two daughters, reached adult age. All his sons acquired a reputation for learning, especially Janus Dousa Filius ('the son'), but he died in 1596 at the age of 25, well before his father. Publications In 1569 Dousa published his first collection of poems (epigrams, satires, elegies, etc.). A new collection appeared in 1575. This collection contains (among other poems) five Odae Lugdunenses on the siege of Leiden. In 1584 a volume of epodes was issued. In 1585 Dousa wrote the Odae Britannicae. 1586 saw the release of a new book of elegies. In 1599 and 1601 Dousa‚Äôs historiographical works appeared. In 1603 a poetic volume called Echo and a collection of three odes was released. Some more works were issued posthumously. Apart from these literary works Dousa published collections of text-critical remarks on and editions of classical authors: Sallust, Horace, Catullus, Tibullus, Petronius, Plautus, Propertius. Dousa‚Äôs historiographical labour is especially relevant. In 1585, when Dousa was 40 years old, he became the first Librarian at Leiden University Library with a special commission to write a history of Holland. At that moment however, he had been pursuing historical studies for several years. If one is to trust Heinsius‚Äô eulogy, Dousa had been studying history since the moment he returned from France. Letters from the years 1582 and 1583 prove that Dousa had at least been deepening his knowledge of the history of Holland since 1577. In the letter from 1582 one even comes across a specimen of his Annales written in hexameters. In 1584 Dousa edited the work of Adrianus Barlandus, a historiographer from Zeeland. His first accomplishment after his commission in 1585 was the posthumous publication of the work of Hadrianus Junius in 1588. However, his political activities prevented him from finishing his own history within a few years. In 1593 two Epistulae apologeticae were published in which Dousa apologized for the fact that the commissioned work had still not appeared. However, the States of Holland had to wait for their history still longer when Dousa‚Äôs eldest son died in 1597. Sorrow kept Dousa from finishing his work until 1599. In this year the metrical Annales were published. Finally, the commissioned prose history (Bataviae Hollandiaeque Annales) was published in 1601. Dousa was rewarded by the States of Holland with a golden chain, a medal, and exemption from the obligation to appear in the Supreme Court. In 1604 Dousa intended to edit the works of the historians Johannes de Beka and Willem Heda, but on October 8 of the same year he died of the plague before he was able to realize this plan. * Jani Dousae filii Poemata. - Roterodami : apud Adrianum van Dijk, 1704. digital See also *Franciscus Dousa References * *Heesakkers, C.L.

It operates unscheduled passenger services throughout the Falkland Islands. It also undertakes aerial surveillance of the exclusive economic zone surrounding the islands.Flight International 3 April 2007 BN Islander, VP-FBD in 1994 History Civil air services in the Falkland Islands began in 1948 when the Falkland Islands government purchased two Auster Mark V light aircraft to improve communications with, and to provide air ambulance services for, outlying communities on the Islands to compensate for the poor road networks on the Islands. The first operational flight was on 24 December 1948, when one of the Austers was used to fly a girl suffering from peritonitis from North Arm settlement to Port Stanley for hospital treatment. The two Austers were supplemented by a third Auster and a Noorduyn Norseman, both configured as floatplanes in 1950. By 1951, the service began to be referred to as the \\"Falklands Islands Government Air Service\\" or FIGAS. Duties included air ambulance, carrying mail, carrying Government officials and fare-paying passengers and freight. In 1953 FIGAS received its first de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver aircraft. The Beaver became the mainstay of FIGAS's operations and the only type operated from 1956 to 1979, with a total of seven Beavers, all floatplanes, purchased, although only two were ever operated at any one time. In 1979, it chose the Britten-Norman Islander, to be flown as landplanes from the numerous grass airstrips on the Islands to replace the Beaver, purchasing its first Islander that year. In April 1982, the Falkland Islands were invaded by Argentina. FIGAS's aircraft were seized by Argentine forces, and were damaged beyond repair by British air and artillery bombardment during the campaign to retake the Falklands, leaving FIGAS without aircraft. An ex- Argentine Army Aviation Bell UH-1 Huey helicopter was briefly operated by FIGAS after the war, but the poor condition of the helicopter and the high cost to certify the Huey as a civil aircraft and operate it resulted in plans to continue using the helicopter being abandoned. FIGAS purchased another Beaver late in 1982, and two Islanders in 1983, allowing operations to be restarted. The Beaver was retired in 1985, with a third Islander acquired in 1986, another in 1987 and another in 1989. Two more, one equipped for fisheries patrol missions, were received in 1990, with its latest Islander purchased in 1992.The fleet then totalled five,https://www.fig.gov.fk/figas/about-us/fleet having sold one and had two damaged beyond repair.https://aviation- safety.net/database/record.php?id=20061119-0https://aviation- safety.net/database/record.php?id=19870624-0 Another aircraft was severely damaged in 2018.https://aviation- safety.net/database/record.php?id=20180611-1In 2019, FIGAS ordered two new Islanders, one for delivery in 2019 and the second in 2020.https://www.pilotweb.aero/news/islands-delivered-to-the- falklands-1-6132670 Fleet FIGAS operates 5 Britten-Norman Islanders.

The mechanism uses a scalar field that propagates throughout the five-dimensional bulk. On each of the branes that end the fifth dimension (frequently referred to as the Planck brane and TeV brane, respectively) there is a potential for this scalar field. The minima for the potentials on the Planck brane and TeV brane are different and causes the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to change throughout the fifth dimension. This configuration generates a potential for the radion causing it to have a vacuum expectation value and a mass. With reasonable values for the scalar potential, the size of the extra dimension is large enough to solve the hierarchy problem.

He was born in Pont du Gard, near N√Æmes, in Provence, France. In 1929, after completing his higher education at the college in Uz√®s, Brusset travelled to Paris where he enrolled at L'√âcole des Arts Appliqu√©s et des Arts Decoratifs and sold his first painting, Le Pont d'Avignon. He went on to exhibit in major galleries such as the Salon des Tuileries and soon earned his first special exhibition. In the preface to the exhibition catalogue Tristan Bernard commended him as \\"A good painter and a true interpreter of nature\\". During the difficult economic times of the 1930s Brusset survived as a decorator, most notably at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1938 he married Marika Rivera, the daughter of the Russian √©migr√© cubist painter Marie Vorobieff (also known as Marevna) and the Mexican cubist painter and muralist Diego Rivera; and they had a son together named Jean Diego Brusset. The marriage did not last long. On the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Brusset was called up to the French Navy. In 1942, he left France for Algiers, where he decorated the studio of the Voice of America. An exhibition in Tunis followed. In 1945 he returned to Paris and re-established himself there with an exhibition in 1946. In L'Amateur d'Art, there was reference to his \\"hitherto much ignored talent\\"; and he was being admired as a \\"true painter\\" with a \\"serious heart\\", a \\"profound interior life\\". During 1948 to 1954 Brusset travelled to Caracas, Venezuela and San Juan, Puerto Rico and spent time in the United States with his exhibition Paris by Brusset under the patronage of the cultural attach√© of the French embassy in Washington, D.C.. As a result of their successful exhibition of his works acquired by the Delgado Museum of Art in New Orleans, Brusset was made a Citizen of Honour of the town and Colonel of the Guard of Honour of the Lord Governor of Louisiana, an honour never previously conferred upon a foreigner. The exhibition then visited many cities, including Memphis, Dallas, San Francisco, New York, Miami, Montreal and Toronto. In 1955 Brusset returned to France, where an exhibition of his ceramics presented at Cannes won him the award of the L'Academie Internationale de la Ceramique of Geneva. In 1956 he collaborated with Jean Cocteau in the decoration of the chapel of Saint Pierre in Villefranche-sur-Mer; and in 1957 he exhibited at the Galerie Vend√¥me in Paris. The paintings were subsequently bought by the French government. Brusset's last special exhibition was La Provence du Brusset, organized by the mayor of Baux-de-Provence on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Fr√©d√©ric Mistral in 1980.

Ordinarily, the functions defined on a sphere form a commuting algebra. A fuzzy sphere differs from an ordinary sphere because the algebra of functions on it is not commutative. It is generated by spherical harmonics whose spin l is at most equal to some j. The terms in the product of two spherical harmonics that involve spherical harmonics with spin exceeding j are simply omitted in the product. This truncation replaces an infinite-dimensional commutative algebra by a j^2-dimensional non-commutative algebra. The simplest way to see this sphere is to realize this truncated algebra of functions as a matrix algebra on some finite-dimensional vector space. Take the three j-dimensional matrices J_a,~ a=1,2,3 that form a basis for the j dimensional irreducible representation of the Lie algebra su(2). They satisfy the relations [J_a,J_b]=i\\\\epsilon_{abc}J_c, where \\\\epsilon_{abc} is the totally antisymmetric symbol with \\\\epsilon_{123}=1, and generate via the matrix product the algebra M_j of j dimensional matrices. The value of the su(2) Casimir operator in this representation is :J_1^2+J_2^2+J_3^2=\\\\frac{1}{4}(j^2-1)I where I is the j-dimensional identity matrix. Thus, if we define the 'coordinates' x_a=kr^{-1}J_a where r is the radius of the sphere and k is a parameter, related to r and j by 4r^4=k^2(j^2-1), then the above equation concerning the Casimir operator can be rewritten as :x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=r^2, which is the usual relation for the coordinates on a sphere of radius r embedded in three dimensional space. One can define an integral on this space, by :\\\\int_{S^2}fd\\\\Omega:=2\\\\pi k \\\\, \\\\text{Tr}(F) where F is the matrix corresponding to the function f. For example, the integral of unity, which gives the surface of the sphere in the commutative case is here equal to :2\\\\pi k \\\\, \\\\text{Tr}(I)=2\\\\pi k j =4\\\\pi r^2\\\\frac{j}{\\\\sqrt{j^2-1}} which converges to the value of the surface of the sphere if one takes j to infinity.

An Indian actress wearing a sleeveless choli with strings tied at the back Traditionally, the choli has been made from the same fabric as the sari, with many sari producers adding extra length to their products so that women can cut off the excess fabric at the end of the sari and use it to sew a matching choli. For everyday wear, cotton-based materials and silk cotton are widely considered the most comfortable. Chiffon and silk are best suited for formal occasions. The ideal fabric for cholis in the summer is chiffon and georgette. Designers have experimented with the choli, influencing pop-culture fashion in the Indian subcontinent, with adventurous tailoring and innovative necklines, such as halter, tubes, backless or stringed. Anupama Raj, a designer and boutique owner, commented that \\"there is a very real need to re-invent the choli so that it can be worn with a variety of outfits. Just as we see the choli to be a deconstructed form of the blouse, we need to deconstruct the choli.\\" Bobby Malik, an exporter-turned-designer commented \\"the choli is the most sensuous of all garments created for women. It not only flatters the feminine form, but also brings out the romanticism in a woman. But where Indian designers have failed is at giving it an international look and making it still more beautiful.\\" Recent styles File:Sherlyn Chopra at Playboy press meet 05.jpg File:Deepika choli 2.jpg File:Priyanka Pripri photograph.jpg File:Indian blouse (rear view).jpg File:IndianModel.jpg File:Deepika choli 1.jpg File:Sofia hayat arjun.jpg File:Kajol at Shantanu- Nikhil's store launch (42).jpg File:Model posing her back in a ghagra choli at Dazzle Bash Show, Dubai, 2008 (cropped).jpg File:Woman wearing sari (31000048043).jpg File:Rubina Dilaik at the BIG Television Awards 2011.jpg File:Koppikar.jpg See also * Blouse * Sari * Gagra choli References External links * Category:Indian clothing Category:Pakistani clothing Category:Embroidery Category:Needlework Category:Saris Category:Tops (clothing) Category:Kerala clothing Category:Embroidery in India Category:Sri Lankan clothing ","title":"Choli"},{"id":"3031611","text":"Guy F. Cordon (April 24, 1890June 8, 1969) was a U.S. politician and lawyer from the state of Oregon. A native of Texas, he served in the Army during World War I and later was the district attorney of Douglas County in Southern Oregon. A Republican, he was appointed and later won election to the United States Senate, serving in office from 1944 to 1955. Early life Guy Cordon was born in Cuero, DeWitt County, Texas, on April 24, 1890.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 63. He moved with his family to Roseburg, Oregon, in 1896, and attended the public schools in that city. In 1909, at the age of 19, he became the deputy tax assessor of Douglas County, Oregon, serving until 1916. In 1914, Cordon married Ana Allen, and they had two children. During World War I he enlisted in the Army and served in the artillery. Political career In 1917 he began serving as the county tax assessor, remaining until 1919. Cordon studied law and then passed the bar in 1920. From 1923 to 1935 he served as the district attorney of Douglas County and then practiced law in Roseburg. Cordon then began working as the lawyer for a group of 18 counties suing the federal government as an outgrowth of the Oregon land fraud scandal involving land grants for the Oregon and California Railroad. In 1944, Cordon was appointed to a seat in the United States Senate from Oregon by Governor Earl Snell following the death of Senator Charles L. McNary. In a special election in November 1944, Cordon was elected to finish the term, receiving 57% of the vote against Democrat Willis Mahoney. Longtime Senator Wayne Morse was elected to his first term in the Senate in that election. Cordon was elected to a full six-year term in 1948, receiving 60% of the vote against Democrat Manley J. Wilson. In 1954, a bad year for Republicans, Cordon was defeated for re- election by Democrat Richard L. Neuberger by a margin of 50.2% to 49.8%. While in the Senate, Cordon suggested a Senate rule (adopted as Rule XXVI part 12, known as the Cordon Rule) that Senate committee reports should indicate how provisions in a bill would change current law. Cordon served as chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1954 until his term expired in 1955. He visited Hawaii to conduct hearings on possible statehood for the then-territory (Hawaii was admitted in 1959). He was in the Senate from March 4, 1944, to January 3, 1955. Later years After leaving the Senate, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. from 1955 to 1962, when he retired. During the early 1950s, Frank Herbert, who would later become a famous science fiction author, was one of Cordon's speechwriters. Guy F. Cordon died in Washington, D.C. on June 8, 1969, at the age of 79 and was buried in Roseburg at the Roseburg Memorial Gardens.

The total seating capacity of the stadium, which was originally 32,000, was restricted to around 26,800 due to redevelopment works; its capacity for the September 2019 completion has been quoted as 39,500 seats (with the possibility of expanding to 42,300 if it were necessary), making it the 11th- largest stadium in Spain and the 2nd-largest in the Basque Country. History and uses It is the third home stadium of Real Sociedad preceded by Ondarreta (1909‚Äì1913), and Atocha (1913‚Äì1993). The external concourse area features a bust of the late Alberto Ormaetxea, the club's manager during their successful early 1980s period. Ormaetxea Real Sociedad's Basque rivals, Athletic Bilbao, were also permitted to use Anoeta for their first home game of the 2013‚Äì14 La Liga season, as their own new ground (San Mam√©s) was still under construction. The stadium has also occasionally hosted matches of the Basque Country national football team. Rugby game at Anoeta Gure Esku Dago political event at Anoeta, 2015 In recent years, it has also been used for concerts, and for occasional Heineken Cup rugby union fixtures by nearby Top 14 club Biarritz Olympique (based in France but very near to San Sebastian). Since the 2009‚Äì10 Top 14 season, both Biarritz and fellow Pays Basque club Aviron Bayonnais took home matches to the Anoeta, which is the closest large stadium to their towns. Four of the unofficial Basque Country team's friendly fixtures have been held at the stadium (1993, 1998, 2004, 2012).\\\\ When the 2019‚Äì20 UEFA Women's Champions League quarterfinals and on were held in the Basque Country, the Anoeta hosted the final. =Opening= Interior of the stadium in 2013 before reconstruction Anoeta station, also opened in 1993, on Metro Donostialdea network Anoeta's initial construction costs were said to be 3 billion pesetas (equivalent to around ‚Ç¨21 million at the time). The stadium was officially opened on 13 August 1993 with a friendly between Real Sociedad and Real Madrid. The first goal was scored by Txuriurdin defender Loren, and the match finished 2‚Äì2. Expansion in the 21st century =Proposals= In 2004, Jos√© Luis Astiazar√°n, then the president of Real Sociedad, launched a project called Gipuzkoarena.Gipuzkoarena (video proposal in YouTube -Spanish-) Planned to be completed in 2007, it was intended to increase the stadium's capacity to 42,000, which would include the removal of the athletics track - over the years, fans were never happy with the stadium in its original configuration due to the track causing a distance between the stands and the field itself, resulting in a \\"cold\\" atmosphere during matches.Estadio Anoeta, The Stadium GuideLLE on the Road ‚Äì A new Sociedad & a better Anoeta, La Liga Expert, 1 October 2019 The project also intended to construct a hotel and shops, among other items. This proposal was soon rejected by the city council and left behind.Elorza comunica a la Real que el Gipuzkoarena \\"pertenece ya al pasado\\" (El Pa√≠s, 31/08/2004 -Spanish-) Towards the end of 2007, I√±aki Badiola, candidate for the presidency of Real Sociedad, proposed that the club buy the stadium.Badiola propone que la Real compre Anoeta al Ayuntamiento (diariovasco.com, 4/12/2007 -Spanish-) This was also soon rejected by the city council.Od√≥n Elorza frena la propuesta de Badiola de comprar Anoeta (diariovasco.com, 6/12/2007 -Spanish-) In 2008, Badiola, by now the president, made another two proposals for the stadium,Badiola propone al Ayuntamiento convertir Anoeta en zona residencial y trasladar el estadio (Noticias de Gipuzkoa, 15/04/2008 -Spanish-) one of them similar to Gipuzkoarena. These proposals were to be studied by the city council, but after 20 December Badiola was no longer the club's president. Later, his successor, Jokin Aperribay, launched a new attempt to refurbish the stadium. =2015 project= In 2015 the club announced that it would begin reforms on Anoeta in 2016, enlarging the stadium as well as removing the track around the field. Construction eventually began in May 2017. When completed in October 2019, the remodelled arena would hold around 42,300 spectators. The ‚Ç¨47 million cost of the project was borne between Real Sociedad (‚Ç¨33m), the Basque Government (‚Ç¨10m) and the Gipuzkoa Provincial Council (‚Ç¨4m). the architect is Izaskun Larzabal, who also designed many of the facilities at the club's Zubieta training complex. After the project completion, the total cost announced including some new improvements that would take place until 2020 was of ‚Ç¨78,6 million. The stadium during the first stage of reconstruction, featuring cranes, February 2018 Depending on any issues and delays encountered, it was reported that the construction work could lead to Real Sociedad playing some matches in Bilbao or elsewhere at some point during the period. The first phase of reconstruction (involving the removal of the track and insertion of lower rows of seats on the side stands, and a completely new south end stand) concluded just after the start of the 2018‚Äì19 La Liga season, requiring the club to play their first three fixtures away from home, before hosting FC Barcelona on the fourth matchday (15 September 2018). Over 3,000 additional members were admitted to the club due to the increase in capacity offered by the remodelled stadium. The second phase of work on the new north end stand was expected to be completed over the course of that season. Real Sociedad played away from home for each of the first three rounds of the 2019‚Äì20 La Liga campaign to allow the stadium rebuild to move to completion. It was announced that the first match at Anoeta ‚Äì or the Reale Arena to use its new sponsored title ‚Äì with all seats in place, a capacity quoted as 39,500 (though with work still ongoing in other areas of the construction) would be between the home side and Atl√©tico Madrid on Saturday 14 September 2019, almost exactly a year after the first new stand was opened. Real won 2‚Äì0, with the official attendance given as 33,374,Real Sociedad vs Atl√©tico Madrid, La Liga greater than the old maximum for Anoeta (and that of Atoxta) and therefore a club record, but some way short of the new capacity. Five months later, a Basque derby against Athletic Bilbao, a 2‚Äì1 win for the home side, set a new record of 36,730.R√©cord hist√≥rico de asistencia en Anoeta con 36.730 espectadores (Attendance record for Anoeta with 36,370 spectators), Mundo Deportivo (in Spoanish), 9 February 2020 The reforms have transformed the atmosphere inside the stadium, with the Aitor Zabaleta singing section acting as the main focal point.

This idealized cavity can be approximated in practice by making a small perforation in the wall of a hollow container of any opaque material. The radiation escaping through such a perforation will be a good approximation to black-body radiation at the temperature of the interior of the container. Inertial confinement fusion Mockup of a gold-plated hohlraum designed for use in the National Ignition Facility The indirect drive approach to inertial confinement fusion is as follows; the fusion fuel capsule is held inside a cylindrical hohlraum. The hohlraum body is manufactured using a high-Z (high atomic number) element , usually gold or uranium. The hohlraum walls must have surface roughness less than 1 micron, and hence accurate machining is required during fabrication. Any imperfection of the hohlraum wall during fabrication will cause uneven and non-symmetrical compression of the fuel capsule inside the hohlraum during inertial confinement fusion. Hence surface finishing is extremely important, as during ICF laser shots, due to intense pressure and temperature, results are highly susceptible to hohlraum texture roughness. Therefore imperfection during hohlraum fabrication is to be carefully prevented. Inside the hohlraum is a fuel capsule containing deuterium and tritium (D-T) fuel. A frozen layer of D-T ice adheres inside the fuel capsule. The fuel capsule wall is synthesized using light elements ( like plastic, beryllium, or high density carbon, i.e. diamond) . The outer portion of fuel capsule explodes outward when ablated by the x-rays produced by the hohlraum wall upon irradiation by lasers. Due to Newton's third law, the inner portion the fuel capsule implodes, causing the D-T fuel to be supercompressed activating fusion reaction. The capsule must be precisely spherical , with texture roughness less than one nanometer, for fusion ignition to start. Otherwise instability will cause fusion to fizzle. The fuel capsule contains a small fill hole with less than 5 microns diameter, to inject the capsule with D-T gas. Depending on hohlraum design, during ICF laser shots, various parameters like shock timing, fuel capsule implosion shape, implosion velocity, and ratio of the cold fuel to the hot fuel core are measured. The radiation source (e.g., laser) is pointed at the interior of the hohlraum rather than at the capsule itself. The hohlraum absorbs and re-radiates the energy as X-rays, a process known as indirect drive. The advantage to this approach, compared to direct drive, is that high mode structures from the laser spot are smoothed out when the energy is re-radiated from the hohlraum walls. The disadvantage to this approach is that low mode asymmetries are harder to control. It is important to be able to control both high mode and low mode asymmetries to achieve a uniform implosion. The X-ray intensity around the capsule must be very symmetrical to avoid hydrodynamic instabilities during compression. Earlier designs had radiators at the ends of the hohlraum, but it proved difficult to maintain adequate X-ray symmetry with this geometry. By the end of the 1990s, target physicists developed a new family of designs in which the ion beams are absorbed in the hohlraum walls, so that X-rays are radiated from a large fraction of the solid angle surrounding the capsule. With a judicious choice of absorbing materials, this arrangement, referred to as a \\"distributed- radiator\\" target, gives better X-ray symmetry and target gain in simulations than earlier designs.Hohlraum Nuclear weapon design The term hohlraum is also used to describe the casing of a thermonuclear bomb following the Teller- Ulam design. The casing's purpose is to contain and focus the energy of the primary (fission) stage in order to implode the secondary (fusion) stage.

The commission consists of five members. Four members are appointed by the Governor of Pennsylvania, while the fifth member is the Pennsylvania Secretary of Transportation. In addition to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the commission also operates the James E. Ross Highway, Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass, Mon/Fayette Expressway and Pittsburgh's Southern Beltway, the latter two of which are currently under construction. The PTC is the only transportation agency in Pennsylvania that is not part of PennDOT, though it does follow current PennDOT policies and procedures. Mark Compton is the current CEO. Legislation in the Pennsylvania General Assembly is currently pending that would fold the PTC into PennDOT, with PennDOT appointing a Deputy Secretary to run the toll roads in the state. Such a move would be done for efficiency and cost reasons, as well as to cut down on the government bureaucracy.  History  The PTC was established by law on May 21, 1937, when Pennsylvania Governor George Earle signed Act 211 into law. The first commissioners were named on June 4 of the same year. On April 28, 2010, Governor Ed Rendell proposed that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission would be merged into the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. A special session of the state legislature voted on this issue on May 4. On August 26, 2010, PennDOT told the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission that they needed to pay them $118 million for public transit funding provided by Act 44 or PennDOT would have veto power over the Turnpike Commission's decisions. In March 2019, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission approved a $2 million study regarding a proposed hyperloop system in Pennsylvania.

Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 30 years. In 2012 Minogue was awarded his PhD in applied ethics, human and social services by La Trobe University, but his thesis is not available to the public for safety reasons.  Russell Street Bombing  The Russell Street Police Headquarters. The Russell Street Bombing occurred at approximately 1 pm on 27 March 1986, Easter Thursday. The blast killed 21-year-old Constable Angela Taylor, left 22 people injured and caused massive damage to the Russell Street Police Headquarters and surrounding buildings, with damage estimated at over $500,000.  Prison life  At about 11.30 am on 22 July 1988, in the maximum security industry yard, Craig Minogue, then 26, beat Alex Tskamakis, 40, to death with a pillow case loaded with 5 kg gym weights. Minogue initiated many legal challenges against the Victorian government, mostly concerning his treatment while imprisoned. In 2002 Minogue applied unsuccessfully to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) and sought copies of prison management and operation manuals.Minogue v Department of Justice (2004) VCAT 1194 (25 June 2004) His request was refused, but he was granted access to limited information and restricted to viewing such information while within the prison library. This decision was widely criticized by academics and lawyers as promoting a lack of administrative transparency in the prison system and creating a situation where the rules that prisoners are supposed to abide by are concealed from them. In 2005 Minogue, who entered the prison system illiterate, completed his Bachelor of Arts degree with honours from Deakin University. In the same year he was accepted as a PhD student at La Trobe University, the first prisoner in Australia and one of the few in the world to do so. Minogue uses his website to post information about his academic work. He writes on his website that he is remorseful for his crimes, and claims that he is among the victims. He also condemns the media's annual remembrance of his crimes, stating that his victims would not want the events remembered. In a coronial inquest into deaths in the fire at the prison Minogue gave evidence over three days. At the completion of the inquest the State Coroner found Corrections Victoria was, in his words, \\"moribund and corrupt\\". A book by Monash University academic and historian Dr. Bree Carlton, Imprisoning Resistance, examined prisoner resistance which led to the Jika Jika fire.Imprisoning Resistance, Life and Death in an Australian Supermax, Sydney Institute of Criminology, Sydney 2007 Parole In 2016, after it was revealed Minogue had applied for parole and following media and public pressure on the Victorian government, Daniel Andrews, the Premier of Victoria, legislated to eliminate the possibility of parole for persons \\"convicted and sentenced\\" to a term of imprisonment \\"for the murder of a person who the prisoner knew was, or was reckless as to whether the person was, a police officer\\" unless the board is satisfied that the prisoner is in imminent danger of dying or is seriously incapacitated.. The law was applied retrospectively and impacted Minogue's application for parole. =High Court 2018= In 2017 Minogue sought to challenge the validity of the new legislation. On 20 June 2018 the High Court unanimously held that the section did not apply to Minogue because he was not sentenced on the basis that the prisoner knew, or was reckless as to whether, the person murdered was a police officer. =High Court 2019= On 1 August 2018 the Victorian parliament amended the Corrections Act to section 74AB that Minogue personally could not be granted parole unless the board is satisfied that he is in imminent danger of dying or is seriously incapacitated.. This was based on provisions in relation to Kevin Crump and Julian Knight that the High Court had previously upheld. The High Court held that a prisoner had no right to be released on parole and the decision was an exercise of the executive power. The punishment imposed by the court was the life sentence and while the legislation removed any practical hope Minogue had for release on parole, this did not alter the sentence imposed by the court. Other charges On 23 May 2019, Minogue was charged with 38 offences including abduction by force and aggravated rape. The charges related to two alleged offences which occurred on 22 November 1985 and 26 March 1986, the day before the Russell Street bombing. Charged with the same offences is Peter Komiazyk (aka Peter Reed) who was also involved with the Russell St bombing. Police allege that a third man, Stanley Taylor, participated in the alleged rape in March 1986. Taylor, the instigator of the bombing, died in prison in 2016. A fourth man is yet to be identified.

It is north of Quirindi and is at the junction of the Main North railway line to Armidale and Moree. At the 2011 census, Werris Creek had a population of 1,437. History The area is thought to have been once occupied by the Kamilaroi Aborigines.'Werris' appears to derive from an Aboriginal word first written as 'Weia Weia', though the exact meaning is not known. There is a similar aboriginal word pronounced \\"Werai\\" which means \\"look out\\" and this may be related because of the prominent hills in the area. In earlier years Werris was written in a variety of ways, including Werres, Werries and Weery's. The first European settlers came to the area in the 1830s and the Weia Weia Creek Station was established by the Reverend Francis Vidal around 1841. By the 1870s, there were 20 pastoral families occupying the valley and on the eastern side of the present townsite was Summer Hill station, belonging to John Single, after whom the main street is named. Werris Creek Post Office opened on 1 January 1878 and a railway station was built there in 1879, designed by the NSW railway engineer John Whitton. It is from Sydney by rail and was termed 'the first railway town in Australia'. On 2 October 2013 Werris Creek was slated to be the location for a film, Unbroken, written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Angelina Jolie.  Heritage listings  Werris Creek has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Main Northern railway: Werris Creek railway station  Geography  Werris Creek is overlooked by Mount Terrible, known to the locals as 'Terrible Billy'. It is 380m or 1246 feet above sea level. It has an average annual rainfall of 685 mm or 27 inches. On 18 July 1965, for the first and only time in recorded history, Werris Creek was blanketed by three inches of snow.  Facilities  Werris Creek has one school, Werris Creek Public, which was established in the 1880s, The town previously had two schools, with St Joseph's Catholic school having been established in 1915 but it closed on 9 April 2009.Werris Creek Primary closes - NBN Television News story, 11 April 2009 The town has a swimming pool (opened in 1968), tennis courts, bowling green and golf club.

The town has a large grain silo and a recently opened (2005) coal mine. The main employer in the town is Pacific National rail company. A high percentage of the working population are also employed in nearby Tamworth. Werris Creek is a four-hour drive from Sydney and is situated midway between the famous wine growing area of the Hunter Region and the cooler climate vineyards of the Northern Tablelands. Werris Creek is also located within three hours of beaches in Newcastle and four hours of Australia's coastal resorts of Forster, Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour.

Prichett (1835-1871). Prichett was laid down 20 July 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Washington; launched 31 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Orville A. Tucker; and commissioned 15 January 1944, Commander Cecil T. Caulfield in command.  Central Pacific campaigns  Following shakedown Prichett sailed, 1 April 1944, for Majuro, thence to Manus where she joined the battleships of Task Force 58 (TF 58). On the 28th, Task Group 58.3 (TG 58.3) sortied and, rendezvousing with the fast carriers, steamed northeast. On the 29th and 30th, they blasted Truk and, on 1 May, pounded Ponape. Then, the force retired to Majuro, whence Prichett returned to Pearl Harbor. There, fighter director equipment was installed and on 30 May she sailed west again, with TF 52 for the invasion of Saipan. Having screened the transports to the objective, she shifted her protective duties to the battleships as they bombarded the shore, then provided gunfire support to the troops landed on 15 June. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea she remained with the transports, then turned her guns on the neighboring Japanese-held island of Tinian. Remaining in the Marianas until mid-August, she alternated gunfire support duties, screening duties and radar picket duties off Saipan with bombardment of Tinian until that island was invaded 24 July, then provided support services for the troops fighting there. In August, she shifted to Guam to support mopping up operations and on the 17th got underway for Eniwetok to rejoin the fast carrier force, now designated TF 38\\\\. Arriving on the 20th, she sortied with TG 38.3 on the 29th and for the next 28 days screened the carriers, and after 11 September, the battleships, as Japanese targets in the Palaus and the Philippines were pounded. Striking first at the Palaus to prepare for the mid-month invasion, the force then turned on Mindanao and the Central Philippines. Between the 15th and the 19th, they supported the Palau invasion, then struck at Luzon and the Visayas before retiring to Ulithi. On 6 October, the force sortied again. The Nansei Shoto, Luzon and Formosa were the targets blasted in preparation for the return to the Philippines. Fired on, by mistake, by a unit of TG 38.4, while off Formosa, 12th-15th, Prichett retired to Manus for repairs and replenishment. From the Admiralties, she steamed to Ulithi and rejoined TG 38.3 for further strikes against Luzon and the Visayas. The force returned again to the same area at the end of November, to support fighting on Leyte, and in December, to support the Mindoro landings.  Iwo Jima and Okinawa  Prichett in 1944. On 30 December, the Ulithi logistics base was left behind again as the force steamed west to welcome the new year, 1945, with strikes against Luzon and Formosa. The ships then thrust into the South China Sea and hit enemy shipping and shore installations from Saigon to Formosa, and then struck at Okinawa. They then retired to Ulithi, replenished, rearmed, and, on 10 February, departed to raid the industrial complexes of Honsh≈´. After striking Tokyo and Yokohama, the force turned back to cover the landings on Iwo Jima, 19 February. There Prichett was reassigned to Task Unit 52.2.5 (TU 52.2.5), with which she remained in the Iwo Jima-Chichi Jima area until 9 March. By 12 March, DD-561 was back at Ulithi to prepare for the invasion of the last stepping stone to the enemy's home islands: Okinawa. Attached to Task Force 54 (TF 54), Prichett arrived off the objective 25 March to cover minesweeping and underwater demolition team operations. Preinvasion bombardment, harassment fire and fire support missions off Kerama Retto followed. On 1 April, she participated in the demonstration \\"feint\\" on southern Okinawa, then swung around to screen the transports off the Hagushi assault area. Just after 01:00, 3 April, the Japanese commenced a long day of aerial resistance. At 01:42, Prichett, having beaten off several attacks, was closed by two bogies. The first veered off, but the second pressed on and dropped a 500-pound bomb on the fantail. Exploding close under the counter, it holed the destroyer below the waterline, causing flooding aft and a fire in the 20 mm. clipping room. The crippled destroyer, maintaining a speed in excess of 28 knots to minimize flooding and bringing the fire under control, remained in the area and continued to ward off enemy planes until relieved shortly before noon. She then retired to Kerama Retto for emergency repairs. On the 7th, she got underway for Guam where repairs were completed, and on 7 May she returned to Okinawa and radar picket duties. For almost 3 months she escaped further serious damage. However, on 29 July, while standing by --a kamikaze victim-- she became the target of a second suicide-minded Japanese pilot. Prichett took him under fire at 5,000 yards, but he bore on. Splashed into the sea approximately 6 feet off the destroyer's port side, his mission was partially accomplished as his lethal cargo exploded on impact, bowing in the ship's hull and causing extensive damage to her superstructure, port depth charge racks, and radio and power leads. Prichett, despite her damage, remained in the area and for another two hours continued to pick up survivors from Callaghan. Awarded a Navy Unit Commendation for her actions off Okinawa, Prichett sailed for home 13 August. Arriving after the cessation of hostilities, she underwent deactivation overhaul at Puget Sound and on 14 March 1946 was decommissioned and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.  1951 - 1954  Reactivated after the invasion of the Republic of Korea by the North Korean People's Army, Prichett recommissioned 17 August 1951. Post activation shakedown off California followed and on 13 January 1952 she got underway for the Atlantic. Arriving at Norfolk, 2 February, she operated off the Mid- Atlantic seaboard until April, then underwent modernization at Boston. Emerging in November with the latest in anti-aircraft weaponry, fire control radar, sonar and communications gear, she became the flagship of Destroyer Division 282 (DesDiv 282). She completed further training in the Caribbean and departed Norfolk, 7 January 1953, for a tour in the Korean combat zone. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she arrived at Sasebo 11 February and on the 15th rendezvoused with TF 77\\\\. Between then and 23 June she performed plane guard and screening duties for the carriers of TF 77, screened battleships and cruisers during bombardment missions, and provided gunfire support, plane control, interdiction and harassment fire, and hospital ship services for United Nations Forces fighting in coastal areas, primarily near Wonsan, North Korea. The Prichett returned to Norfolk via the Suez Canal, completing her round-the-world cruise 22 August. From 7 January to 11 March 1954 she deployed to the Mediterranean, then, after exercises in the Caribbean and shipyard availability, got underway, 5 January 1955, to return to the Pacific.  1955 - 1970  Assigned to DesDiv 192, she reported to CinCPac 17 January 1955 and by May she was en route to Japan for her first West Pacific deployment since the Korean War. Homeported at Long Beach for the next nine years, she alternated 7th Fleet tours, ASW-HUK and carrier exercises and Taiwan Strait patrols, with training operations, including sonar and gunnery school ship assignments, off the west coast. In August 1964, however, her 7th Fleet deployment was extended and, for the third time, she joined in combat operations in the western Pacific. On 30 August 1964 she joined TF 77 in the Tonkin Gulf and until 31 October operated in the South China Sea in support of South Vietnamese and American operations against North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces. Homeported at San Diego on her return, Prichett's tours in the West Pacific since that time were lengthened; most of her deployed time was spent off Vietnam. In the combat zone, she served as plane guard for carriers in the South China Sea and provided support fire for R.V.N., U.S., and R.O.K. forces operating along the 1000-mile coastline from the Gulf of Siam to the north of Hu·∫ø. Illustrative of such support were her actions, 20 February-10 March 1968, off Phan Thi·∫øt. There her guns silenced an enemy mortar battery, damaged the enemy's command post, and delivered accurate call fire to break up enemy emplacements, and personnel and supply concentrations to contribute to the enemy's withdrawal. Prichett made the final westpac cruise 5 June 1969 through 18 November 1969 serving on the gunline in Vietnam for \\"call to fire\\" support for 17 days, subsequently returning to the Tonkin Gulf for plane guard duty with the USS Hancock until returning to San Diego to be decommissioned and was struck from the Navy List 10 January 1970.  Transfer to Italy  Prichett was transferred to Italy on 17 January 1970, and renamed Geniere (D 555). She was stricken and scrapped in 1975. Honors Prichett earned eight battle stars during World War II and two during the Korean War.

The team is owned by Allen Pezo, and includes Pezo, Larry Jaruzel, Lenny Kuilder and Dale Mitchell as drivers. The trucks are famous for their \\"cat\\" designs, with the trucks modeled after a panther, tiger, and leopard, respectively. The team also occasionally runs a conventional Dodge Ram by the name of Lone Eagle. History Allen Pezo built his first monster truck, the original Lone Eagle, out of a brand-new 1985 Chevrolet Silverado at the age of 15. After campaigning this truck, and another truck known as White Knight, for several years, he rebodied Lone Eagle and named it Predator. The truck originally started out as a 1988 Chevrolet Silverado that was on the former Lone Eagle chassis. The second Predator was an all new truck, also a Chevy Silverado. The chassis was painted yellow, but cosmetically the truck was a duplicate of the original truck. This truck was later converted to a race truck, with 12\\" shocks, was sold and became Radioactive. Near the end of the 1980s, Allen bought an M42 tank and converted it into the competition vehicle, Predator Trax. The third Predator was Pezo's first \\"stage three\\" monster truck, and featured a four-link suspension, mid- mounted engine, and a new pink chassis and neon colored body. This chassis also ran as Hyperactive, whenever Pezo had Predator 4 and 3 at the same event. This truck was sold and is now running independent events as \\"Terminator\\". Prowler in Cape Girardeau, MO In 1993, Pezo second stage three monster truck was the first panther design Predator. This chassis was one of the first Patrick Enterprises Incorporated chassis that Dan Patrick didn't build for Bigfoot 4x4. Alan modified the chassis by adding a front-facing four-link suspension, which allowed the front tires to push the chassis, like the rear tires. The new body design and image was created for the Monster Wars television show. Although Predator had made several television appearances before this point, it was Monster Wars which put Pezo in the national spotlight for the first time. After being sold, the chassis was reacquired by the team in 2003 and now runs as both Predator and Lone Eagle. Pezo's fifth Predator is a production Patrick chassis. The truck debuted in 1995 with a cantilever rear suspension, but was quickly changed to a more conventional straight-shock setup the next year. In 1999, a second Patrick chassis, identical to the first, debuted, with the new Prowler body. This truck was created to be a travelling partner to Predator, however it can \\"wear\\" the Predator body if necessary. Both Predator and Prowler have been Monster Jam World Finalists, with Predator most recently competing in the 2006 finals. Also in 2006, the team debuted a third identity called Pouncer, which was designed by Hot Wheels and typically runs as an alternate body for the Prowler chassis. For the 2007 season, Allen built a brand-new Predator. The truck is similar to the others, utilizing Clark planetaries, an Aries engine, SCS transfer case and F-106 housings. Unlike the other three trucks Alan currently owns, the truck has one 4\\" Knight stalker shock on each corner, and is loosely based on Grave Digger 19 and 20. The truck also sports a paint scheme that resembles the Hotwheels die cast of Predator. Hallmarks Pezo is known as one of the best freestylers in the sport. He excels at keeping up momentum and performing huge jumps. Typically, he is also able to finish the run with his truck intact, although he does perform stunts which have a high degree of danger. One of his most famous moments is when Pezo was racing in the New Orleans Superdome. Pezo got massive air and the truck landed on its rear end. It was such a hard impact that it damaged the floor. His cartwheel crashes in Jacksonville, Florida in 2004 and Indianapolis, Indiana in 2005 were among the most spectacular moments of their respective years. Prowler/Pouncer drivers Larry Jaruzel, Dale Mitchell, and Lenny Kuilder are less spectacular and more consistent, but still post high scores often. The Predator team also has the reputation of being formidable racing opponents. In 2013, Allen Pezo was the 13th person to be inducted into the International Monster Truck Hall of Fame.

Alternate common spellings of Warao are Waroa, Guarauno, Guarao, and Warrau. The term Warao translates as \\"the boat people,\\" after the Warao's lifelong and intimate connection to the water. Most of the approximately 20,000 Warao inhabit Venezuela's Orinoco Delta region, with smaller numbers in neighboring Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname. They speak an agglutinative language, Warao.  Lifestyle  =Transportation= Warao use canoes as their main form of transportation. Other modes, such as walking, are hampered by the hundreds of streams, rivulets, marshes, and high waters created by the Orinoco. Warao babies, toddlers, and small children are famed for their ability to hold tight to their mothers' necks, as well as to paddle. They often learn to swim before they learn to walk. The Warao use two types of canoes. Bongos, which carry up to 5 people, are built in an arduous process that starts with the search for large trees. When an old bongo is no longer usable, a consensus is reached by the male leaders of each household on which tree is best. At the start of the dry season, they find the tree and kill it. At the end of the dry season, they return to cut it down. It is then hollowed out and flattened with fire and stone tools traded from the mountains (or local shell tools). The other type of canoe is a small, seating only three people, and is used for daily travel to and from food sources. Image:orboatbuilders1.jpgWarao Indians constructing a traditional dugout canoe, Orinoco delta. Simoina area, Delta Amacuro, Venezuela. Image:oremptycanoe.jpgTraditional bongo. Image:orcindiansincanoe.jpgTypical Warao canoe. =Diet= The Warao diet is varied with an emphasis on the products of the delta, mostly fish. By 1500 they had acquired basic horticulture, although many of their daily fruits and vegetables come from the wild orchards of the delta. In July and August, Warao feast on crabs when they come to the delta from the beach. Hunting is generally avoided due to cultural taboos. They occasionally also eat grubs found in the moriche palm tree. =Religion= The Warao are, according to their own reports, descended from an adventurous heavenly figure -- the primordial hunter. This man originally dwelt in a sky world which had men, but was completely devoid of all animals except birds. Hunting these heavenly birds, the founding man used his bow and arrow to strike a bird in mid-air. The bird fell from the sky and eventually hit the heavenly floor. The birds burst through the floor and proceeded through the clouds and towards terrestrial land (Earth) below. The hunter went to the hole in the floor made by the bird and looked through. He saw lush and fertile land (Earth) and resolved to descend to it to partake of its pleasures: beauty, abundant game, fruit, et cetera. The hunter took a long rope of heavenly cotton, tied it to a tree, and threw it through the hole and lowered himself through the clouds to what is now Earth, forsaking his sky world. The Warao have shamans, who perform music such as rain dances and songs.Dale Alan Olsen Music of the Warao of Venezuela: Song People of the Rain Forest 1996- Page 253 \\"By contrast, his elderly friend Jaime Zapata, who sang several songs with him during our recording sessions, studied hoarotu shamanism for only three days.\\"  First contact with Europeans  The Warao of eastern Venezuela's Orinoco first had contact with Europeans when, soon after Christopher Columbus reached the Orinoco river delta, Alonso de Ojeda decided to navigate the river upstream. There, in the delta, Ojeda saw the distinctively stilted Warao huts, balanced over the water. Similar architecture in Sinamaica far to the west had been likened to Venice, with its famous canals below and buildings above; this new encounter propagated the name of Venezuela (\\"little Venice\\") for the whole land. Contemporary issues The inaccessibility of the Warao's lands makes access to health care difficult. Tuberculosis is common. HIV was first detected in 2007 in the Warao communities of the lower Orinoco Delta region of Venezuela. Sex between men is a common practice among young Warao, especially before they are married, and, is thought to be a major factor in the rapid spread of the disease. In some communities already 35% test positive for the HIV virus. With Venezuela's failing health care system, there is an absence of prevention programs; this, together, with severe language barriers ‚Äî many Warao are illiterate and do not speak fluent Spanish ‚Äî have allowed ignorance about the disease to flourish. The culture is felt to be severely threatened.. In the summer of 2008, indigenous leaders and researchers from the University of California, Berkeley issued a report detailing the deaths of 38 Warao in the Delta Amacuro state from a mysterious illness. The disease, which causes \\"partial paralysis, convulsions and an extreme fear of water\\" is believed to be a form of rabies transmitted by bats. Upon reaching Caracas to inform the government of the outbreak and request assistance, the leaders and researchers were \\"met with disrespect on every level, as if the deaths of indigenous people are not even worth anything.\\" Film treatment In April 2017, The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a film by Cuban-Venezuelan director Mario Crespo with a cast of nonprofessional actors. The film presents the difficulty of choosing to stay with the Warao traditions and life or to leave to gain an education among the \\"Creoles\\". The film includes a detailed look at Warao culture and life along the river. The film is: \\"Dauna. Lo que lleva el r√≠o (Gone with the River). 2015, Venezuela, in the Spanish and Warao languages. Tourism Tourism has come to the Warao which brings relative wealth for some. Several individuals have set up rough and ready tourist accommodation in their own homes. They offer canoe trips (hand and power) to see the wild life of the delta, also a chance to experience their traditional life and culture. These visits can be arranged in the state capital town of Tucupita through one of many travel agents.

Crime There is little local crime in the area. Nevertheless, drugs are smuggled down the Orinoco river into the delta for transshipment to the USA. The Venezuelan Navy patrols the main river branches and the river police have stations at key points. The traffic movements of everyone are monitored and recorded. However, they are tourist friendly.

It is situated on the Heart of Wales Line at its junction with the branch lines to Brynamman and Abernant.  History  The station was originally fairly large and built adjacent to the Dynevor tinplate works and included station buildings, signal box, freight yard and from 1931 a small railway locomotive shed. The signal box (formerly one of three at the station and dating from 1892)\\"Pantyfynnon (South) signal box\\" Signalling Record Society; Retrieved 8 July 2016 is the only surviving example on the HoW route and since 1986, it has supervised the entire line north of here to using a system of working known as No Signalman Token Remote (NSTR).NSTR operation www.railsigns.uk; Retrieved 24 December 2016 It is also a 'fringe box' for the power box at , which controls the line south from here towards and supervises access to the freight branch to Gwaun-cae-Gurwen (which is worked under 'One Train Working' regulations). The Llanelly Railway first reached the village as long ago as 1839, continuing eastwards to Garnant following within a year and the main line being extended to Duffryn (the current Ammanford) in May 1841. The station on the current site was first built at this time, although it has undergone several significant alterations since then. Brynamman would be reached (under GWR auspices) in 1886, some 45 years after the opening of the mineral line from Garnant to Gwaun-cae-Gurwen, whilst the network of routes reached from Pantyffynnon would be completed in 1922 with the opening of the short branch to the colliery at Abernant. This was planned to be a through route to connect the coalfield with the Swansea District Line but was never completed.Body, p.141 Neither it nor the GcG branch was ever used by passenger services, even though a number of stations were built on both lines.

His early movies were mostly comedies. His biggest success was Hon dansade en sommar (1951, aka. One Summer of Happiness), which earned him the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and a nomination for the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. It caused some controversy at the time because it contained nudity. His 1953 film of Peder Sj√∂gren's second novel, Bread of Love (K√§rlekens br√∂d), based on Sj√∂gren's experiences as a volunteer in the Finnish Continuation War of 1941-44 angered the author, was banned in Finland and incurred the wrath of the Soviets at the Cannes Film Festival. In spite of all this, Sj√∂gren grudgingly admitted that as a study of men under severe pressure it was impressive.Problem while searching in The Literature Collection In 1958 he directed Damen i svart, the first in the series of five Hillman-thrillers, centred on Folke Mellvig's crime-solving middle-class city couple Kajsa and John Hillman. The second in the series, Mannek√§ng i r√∂tt (1958), is considered by some to be a precursor of the Italian giallo films, notably Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace. The popularity of his mystery movies declined and in the 1970s and 1980s he made mostly low-budget thrillers - some in collaboration with Mats Helge Olsson - which got mostly bad reviews.

The area became the heart of Sheffield's steel industry during the 19th and 20th century. However it went into decline during the 1970s and 1980s as the nature of steel manufacture changed from large industrial sites with large scale employment to more streamlined and automated manufacture.

He is best known for his victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo on 24 July 1823, in which a royalist Spanish fleet was defeated. Life and career Jos√© Prudencio Padilla (Riohacha, Colombia, March 19, 1784 - Bogot√°, Colombia, October 2, 1828) was a hero in the battles of independence for Gran Colombia (present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama). He was the foremost naval hero of the campaign for independence led by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the creator of the first Navy and Admiral of Great Colombia. His parents were Andres Padilla, who was a builder of small boats, and Lucia Lopez. He started life as a seaman in the domestic service of merchant vessels in port and homeland at 14 years old and appeared as porter at the Royal Spanish chamber of the New Kingdom of Granada. On October 21, 1805 he received his baptism of fire at the battle of Trafalgar, at which he was taken prisoner by the English. In 1808, after his release he returned to Spain, where he was appointed to the boatswain's arsenal at Cartagena de Indias. On April 11, 1811 he took part in the decision of the people of Gethsemane, who, in sympathy with the city of Cartagena, joined in the proclamation of independence of Cundinamarca, thus disregarding the authority of the metropolis. In 1814 he saw action at Tolu and captured a Royalist sloop of war with 170 crew that was going to Panama. Although the ship he captured had more powerful guns than the one he commanded, it could not resist the attack and surrendered. In recognition of this, the Granadino government awarded Padilla with a promotion to second frigate lieutenant. In 1815 he served under the command of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var when he went from Bogot√° to Santa Marta to free Cartagena de Indias, besieged by the army of General Pablo Morillo, defended its walls until it became impossible to hold the siege. Then he went to Jamaica, and as Captain, he met Bol√≠var in Haiti to reinforce the expedition which sailed from Los Cayos de San Luis on March 31, 1816, where he won the naval victory at Los Frailes (May 2), and conducted the landing at Car√∫pano (June 1). Afterwards, he was promoted to frigate captain and commander in chief of the riverine forces, made significant inroads over the province of Cumana. In 1819 participated in the campaign of Casanare, in which he managed the transportation of troops and war material. As second-in-command to Admiral Luis Bri√≥n he arrived at Riohacha on March 12, 1820, and then he fought in the battles of Laguna Salada, Pueblo Viejo, Tenerife, La Barra, Ci√©naga de Santa Marta and San Juan. Named commander-in-chief of the forces of the Republic that besieged Cartagena, he captured several Spanish vessels. On April 19, 1823, he was promoted to brigadier general of the Colombian Navy. This time he was invested with the office of commander general of the Third Department of the Navy and of the Zulia Theater of Operations; on this position, he did a brilliant job that culminated on July 24, 1823 in the naval battle of Lake Maracaibo, in which he defeated the Spanish squadron, which led to the capitulation of the field marshal Francisco Tom√°s Morales the following August 3rd, 1823. On November 24, 1826 he was promoted to general of division. However, at the beginning of 1828, Padilla was linked to an act of indiscipline in which several officers were involved in Cartagena, after which he was reduced and sent to prison in Bogot√° on May 26, 1828. During the night of September 25, 1828, it was carried out an attack on the life of the Liberator (Septembrina Conspiracy), while the assault was executed at San Carlos Palace, some conspirators scaled the walls of the building which served as prison, and assassinated Colonel Jos√© Bol√≠var, releasing Padilla and appointing him as chief. There is no record of his escape, but he was judged by a tribunal for the charge of conspiracy, then sentenced to death and executed in the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n in Bogot√° on 2 Oct. 1827. The remains of Admiral Padilla lie inside the Cathedral of Our Lady of Remedios in Riohacha, which was declared in his honor as a Cultural Heritage of the Colombian nation. He has been commemorated in Venezuela, with the naming of the Almirante Padilla Municipality in Zulia State.

The Dian buried their dead in vertical pit graves.Archaeology of Asia, pp. 247 The Dian language was likely one of the Tibeto-Burman languages. The Dian were gradually displaced and assimilated into Han Chinese culture as the Han dynasty expanded towards what is now Yunnan. The Han Empire's annexation of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC eventually led to the establishment of the Yizhou commandery. History A bronze vessel showing seven oxen being hunted by two tigers, made by the Dian people. Bronze vessel featuring tiger, deer, and ox Dian was an ancient kingdom situated in modern Yunnan, southwestern China. According to Han historian, Sima Qian, it was established in 279 BC when King Qingxiang of Chu sent a military force to the southwest. Zhuang Qiao, a general of Chu, reached the Dian Lake as part of the Chu military campaign. When the Chu homeland was invaded by the Qin, Zhuang Qiao decided to stay in Yunnan and adopt the native ways, establishing the Dian kingdom. The Qin dynasty was subsequently overthrown by the Han, and the commanderies of the new dynasty, Ba and Shu, bordered Dian. According to the Shiji, the southwest was dominated by barbarians, among whom the ruler of Yelang was the most powerful. To the west of Yelang were the Mimo and the most powerful among them was the ruler of Dian. North of Dian was Qiongdu. All these people styled their hair in a mallet-shaped fashion. These were settled peoples who worked the fields and lived in settlements. In the area from Tongshi east to Yeyu were the Sui and Kunming tribes who braided their hair and moved from place to place with their herds. They had no fixed abodes or rulers. Northeast of the Sui were the Xi and Zuodu. The most powerful of the Zuodu were the Ran and Mang, who lived west of Shu. Some of them moved from place and place but others lived in fixed abodes. Northeast of the Ran and Mang were the Baima, who belonged to the Di tribe. In 135 BC, the Han envoy Tang Meng brought gifts to Duotong, the king of Yelang, which bordered Dian, and convinced him to submit to the Han. The Jianwei Commandery was established in the region. In 122 BC, Emperor Wu dispatched four groups of envoys to the southwest in search of a route to Daxia in Central Asia. One group was welcomed by the king of Dian but none of them were able to make it any further as they were blocked in the north by the Sui and Kunming tribes of the Erhai region and in the south by the Di and Zuo tribes. However they learned that further west there was a kingdom called Dianyue where the people rode elephants and traded with the merchants from Shu in secret. In 111 BC, Emperor Wu of Han ordered the barbarian tribes of Jianwei Commandery to raise troops for the campaign against Nanyue. Fearing that neighboring tribes would attack them in the absence of their men, the tribe of Julan rebelled against the Han and killed the governor of Jianwei Commandery. After Nanyue was defeated, Han forces turned north and subjugated the various tribes of Yelang, Julan, Toulan, Qiong, Zuo, Ran, and Mang. The Dian Kingdom was annexed by the Han under the reign of Emperor Wu of Han in 109 BC and the Yizhou commandery established. The Dian King willingly received the Chinese invasion in the hopes of assistance against rival tribes. It was at this time he received his seal from the Chinese, and became a tributary. Emperor Wu sent Wang Ranyu to persuade the king of Dian to submit, pointing out that many of the neighboring tribes had already been defeated. The king of Dian was initially reluctant to accept the offer for he still possessed some 30,000 troops as well as the allegiance of the nearby Laojin and Mimo tribes. However, in 109 BC, Han troops from Ba and Shu wiped out the Laojin and Mimo, leading the king of Dian to surrender. While Dian became Yizhou Commandery (), the king was allowed to continue his rule until a rebellion during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han. The Han proceeded with colonization and conquered the people of Kunming in 86 and 82 BC, reaching all the way to what is now modern day Myanmar. Royal burials The Dian buried their kings at Shizhaishan, which was uncovered in 1954 near Shizhai Village in Jinning County, Yunnan. The burials were identified by the inscription King Dian's Seal. The inscription was written in seal script on a gold imperial seal of investiture given by the Han Emperor. Sima Qian noted that the Dian were one of only two local groups to have received an imperial seal, the other being Yelang. Both have survived: the Yelang Seal emerged in 2007 from a Hmong man in Guizhou, claiming to be the Yelang King's 75th generation descendant. Culture =Bronze working= The Dian people were sophisticated metal workers, casting both bronze and iron. The Dian cast bronze objects using both the piece mould method and the lost wax method. Dian elite burials contained an impressive array of bronze objects, although late Dian burials also contained locally cast iron objects. Large bronze drums were employed by the Dian to communicate in battle; ritual burials of Dian elites were accompanied by large bronze drums filled with cowrie shells. The tops of the drums were removed and replaced by a bronze lid. =Saka influences= Iaroslav Lebedynsky and Victor H. Mair speculate that some Sakas may also have migrated to the area of Yunnan in southern China following their expulsion by the Yuezhi in the 2nd century BCE. Excavations of the prehistoric art of the Dian civilization of Yunnan have revealed hunting scenes of Caucasoid horsemen in Central Asian clothing. The scenes depicted on these drums sometimes represent these horsemen practicing hunting. Animal scenes of felines attacking oxen are also at times reminiscent of Scythian art both in theme and in composition. File:ÈéèÈáëÊé≥Êé†ÈìúÊâ£È•∞.jpgThe ox is featured heavily in Dian artwork. This bronze belt buckle for example shows Dian armoured warriors around an ox and its calves.

The bronze lids depicted the Dian people engaged in everyday activities such as hunting, farming and weaving. Other scenes depicted the leisurely pursuits of the Dian people, such as bullfighting, dancing and music-making. The Dian people dressed in tunics over short pants and wore their hair in topknots. The bronze lids corroborated Sima Qian's description of the Dian hairstyle. Many scenes depicted the Dian at war, often riding horses. Archaeological evidence shows that horses had been domesticated by the Dian people as early as the sixth century BCE. The bronze lids also depicted the Dian decapitating their enemies (who wore their hair in long plaits). The Kingdom was based on agriculture, the bronzes also showed head hunting, human sacrifice, and slaves as part of Dian society.

Description The Great Indoors were approximately 140,000 square feet each. Employing nearly 300 employees for each store. Stores were organized around the four main rooms of the home -- kitchen, bath, bedroom and the great room -- with a fifth area devoted to floors and walls. each store showcased approximately 75 lifestyle vignettes with more than 50,000 items to help customers visualize solutions for their own rooms. Brands typically found within included Bosch, Kenmore, Bose, Calphalon, Corian, Croscill, Karastan, KitchenAid, Kohler, Thermador and Waverly. The company opened seven The Great Indoors stores in 2002, bringing the total to 20 stores, with an additional store planned to open in 2003. History The Great Indoors concept was introduced in 1997. Sears believed it had growth potential within the following 10 years. However, the chain did not prove successful and Sears closed stores, starting with a first round in 2005. At one time, The Great Indoors had $550 million in sales. On February 1, 1998, Sears, Roebuck and Co opened the first The Great Indoors store in Lone Tree, CO.

The Warner Bros. production stars Will Hutchins as Tom Brewster, an Easterner who comes to the Oklahoma Territory to become a lawyer. Jack Elam is cast in occasional episodes as sidekick Toothy Thompson. Brewster was a correspondence-school student whose apparent lack of cowboy skills earned him the nickname \\"Sugarfoot\\", a designation even below that of a tenderfoot. Background Sugarfoot had no relation to the 1951 Randolph Scott Western film Sugarfoot aside from the studio owning the title (and the theme music), but its pilot episode was a remake of a 1954 Western film called The Boy from Oklahoma starring Will Rogers, Jr., as Tom Brewster. The pilot and premiere episode, \\"Brannigan's Boots,\\" was so similar to The Boy from Oklahoma that Sheb Wooley and Slim Pickens reprised their roles from the film. As played by Rogers in the film, Brewster carried no gun, disliked firearms in general and vanquished villains with his roping skills (√† la Will Rogers, Sr.) if friendly persuasion failed. Perhaps for practical reasons, the pilot altered the character slightly and made Brewster more like the typical Western hero‚Äîreluctant to use guns (or any other kind of violence) but able and willing to do so if necessary. That remained his stance throughout the series, and the title song mentions that Sugarfoot carries a rifle and a law book. Whenever he enters a saloon, Sugarfoot refuses alcohol and orders sarsaparilla \\"with a dash of cherry\\". (Sarsaparilla is a drink similar to root beer.) Sugarfoot was one of the earliest products of the alliance between ABC and the fledgling Warner Brothers Television Department, chaired by William T. Orr. During the same period, other similar programs would appear, including Maverick, Cheyenne, Bronco, Lawman, and Colt .45. Hutchins appeared as Sugarfoot in crossover episodes of Cheyenne and Maverick, and in an installment of Bronco called \\"The Yankee Tornado\\" with Peter Breck as a young Theodore Roosevelt. Jack Kelly appeared as Bart Maverick in the Sugarfoot episode \\"A Price on His Head.\\" Sugarfoot is only partly set in Oklahoma; the character seems to appear at any place in the West though geographic place names are often missing in the scripts. He often journeys south of the border into Mexico, and numerous episodes are rich in Hispanic culture, with various roles played by Mexican or Mexican-American actors. Cast of \\"Brannigan's Boots\\" The pilot and premiere episode, \\"Brannigan's Boots\\", aired on September 17, 1957. In the story line, Tom Brewster is appointed the sheriff of the town of Bluerock by politicians who believe his apparent lack of cowboy skills will render him unable to maintain order after the murder of Sheriff Brannigan. Brewster takes the appointment seriously and symbolically puts on a pair of boots left behind in the sheriff's office. Brannigan's daughter, Katie (played by Merry Anders), sees Brewster wearing her father's boots and calls him a \\"sugarfoot\\". She questions whether he is capable of filling her father's boots. \\"Sugarfoot\\" then successfully finds her father's killer but not without a fictitious incident with Billy the Kid (played by Dennis Hopper). He soon wins Katie's heart too. The opening episode reveals that Sugarfoot's guns, mailed to him by his mother, were those of his late father. Will Hutchins ...

Joe Downey Selected episodes =1957= In \\"Reluctant Hero\\", the second episode of the series (October 1, 1957), Sugarfoot takes a ranch job from the aging Charlie Cade (Will Wright). He soon finds that Cade is involved in a range war with Ken and Linda Brazwell, brother-and-sister ranchers played by Michael Dante and Gloria Talbott. Sugarfoot clashes with Cade's foreman Curly Day (Steve Brodie), who burns down Cade's ranch house after Cade fires him. Cade dies in the fire, and Sugarfoot is shot in the attack. Linda takes it upon herself to nurse Sugarfoot back to health. I. Stanford Jolley plays the mysterious \\"The Nighthawk\\". In \\"The Strange Land\\" (October 15, 1957), viewers learn that Sugarfoot's father, George Brewster, was a highly regarded law-enforcement officer. Based on a story by Louis L'Amour, this episode focuses upon an embittered rancher named Cash Billings (Morris Ankrum). An old friend of George Brewster's, Billings hires Sugarfoot to repair fence on Billings' Slash B Ranch. Billings has allowed a hired gunman, Burr Fulton (Rhodes Reason), to take over his spread and harass the neighboring small ranchers, but Sugarfoot arrives to bring law and justice to the situation. Jan Chaney plays Billings's daughter, Anne, who takes a liking to Sugarfoot, the nickname that is the title of the series. Anne had accidentally killed her brother in a shooting, and her father was unforgiving. In the unusually titled \\"Bunch Quitter\\" (October 29, 1957), Sugarfoot is hired by Otto Jardine (Frank Ferguson, earlier of My Friend Flicka), for a mysterious cattle drive to an unknown destination. Kathleen Case plays Gail Jardine, Otto's daughter, who is smitten by an outlaw, Blacky (Ray Danton). When Blacky fatally shoots the trail boss Slim Jackson (Tyler McVey), Sugarfoot gathers the evidence to bring him to justice. In \\"Trail's End\\" (November 12, 1957), Sugarfoot comes upon a former childhood sweetheart, Kathy Larsen (Venetia Stevenson), who is managing a dance hall. Chris Alcaide plays the corrupt Clay Horton, who forces Kathy to marry him so that she cannot testify in court in regard to Horton's crimes. Barbara Stuart portrays Muriel, Kathy's business partner. Gordon Jones plays Sugarfoot's lively friend, Wasco Wolters, who has an interest in Muriel. This episode reveals that Tom Brewster spent his childhood in Vermont before coming to the Oklahoma Territory. In \\"Quicksilver\\" (November 26, 1957), Sugarfoot investigates the robbery of a silver mine which prevents the owner from meeting his payroll. The episode features Lane Bradford as the cutthroat Ellis; John Litel as Hank Tatum, the owner of the mine, and Fay Spain as Tatum's daughter, Susie, the girlfriend and eventual wife of the local sheriff. Frank Wilcox plays George Beaumont, an unscrupulous businessman who had been rejected years earlier by Hank Tatum's late wife. =1958= Joi Lansing guest stars as the unsavory but attractive \\"Peaches\\", who claims to be a belle from Georgia, in the episode \\"Bullet Proof\\" (January 21, 1958). Sugarfoot tricks a gang into believing that he knows the location of the loot from their last bank robbery. Gregory Walcott plays Peaches' presumed fiance, Duke McKlintock, and Don \\"Red\\" Barry is cast as Tanner. After several episodes aired in the second season, a disappointed Hutchins complained in a letter to executive director William T. Orr that the scripts were written so that the lead character Sugarfoot was not particular needed in many of the episodes. The action revolved around Sugarfoot who was often not a real party to the events. Hutchins attributed writer and director Montgomery Pittman for saving the series for two more seasons by setting the tone for the redirection of the latter scripts. Pittman directed four episodes and wrote four others. In the second-season premiere on September 16, 1958, Will Wright returns to portray Job Turner, a curmudgeon living alone in the desert. Entitled \\"Ring of Sand\\", the episode is a lesson in vengeance, forgiveness, and hope. Three outlaws, played by John Russell, Edd Byrnes, and Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr., have in a stagecoach robbery murdered Turner's son, a newly licensed medical doctor. The men compel Turner to take them to the Mexican border, but Turner seeks vengeance by leading the trio around in circles despite the lack of water and a crippling sandstorm. Tom Brewster's role in the episode is tangential, as Hutchins had explained in his letter to William T. Orr. Sugarfoot was at Turner's house delivering a letter when the outlaws arrived. Sugarfoot uses biblical quotations to soften Turner's heart, particularly when a young woman with a baby is found wandering in the desert after the murder of her husband. Meanwhile, Russell and Byrnes launched their own ABC/WB series, Lawman and 77 Sunset Strip, respectively, just a couple of weeks after this episode aired. In \\"Brink of Fear\\" (September 30, 1958), a lesson about the line of good and evil in the human heart, Tom Brewster attempts to help his boyhood friend Cully Abbott, using the name Todd Frye (Jerry Paris), put aside his lawless past after Abbott is paroled from prison. Abbott's former partners in crime come into the town where he is trying to start afresh and compel him into a bank robbery. Abbott becomes discouraged when the young woman he likes, Dodie Logan (Venetia Stevenson), has no romantic interest in him. When the moment of truth arrives, Abbott returns to his criminal ways, and Sugarfoot must hunt him down. Allen Case appears as the hot-headed deputy Bud Wilkins a year prior to being cast as \\"the deputy\\" in the NBC series, The Deputy. Tommy Rettig with Will Hutchins in Sugarfoot (1958). In a gloomy episode entitled \\"The Ghost\\" (October 28, 1958), Tommy Rettig plays Steve Carter, a troubled youth whom Sugarfoot is hired to escort to St. Louis to collect an inheritance. The youth is falsely charged with the murder of a sheriff. Rettig sings part of the popular western song, \\"The Streets of Laredo\\". The episode has been called \\"a Greek Chorus in a Stetson hat\\". Other guest stars include Ed Kemmer, Gail Kobe, and Martin Landau, who plays \\"The Ghost\\". In \\"The Hunted\\" (November 25, 1958), based on a story in True West Magazine, Sugarfoot, while working in a railroad gang, befriends a wounded former soldier, John Allman (Mike Lane), who has become mentally unbalanced as a result of the terror of an Apache attack on his Army unit. Allman engages in bank robbery and murder, but Sugarfoot is unable to bring him to justice because of the impatient action of a persistent posse led by Clay Calhoun (R.G. Armstrong). Francis De Sales appears in this episode as Major Sterling. In \\"Yampa Crossing\\" (December 9, 1958), Sugarfoot and three other men wait at a river crossing for high water to subside. Sugarfoot has been retained to obtain a legal statement from Galt Kimberly (Harold J. Stone) regarding Kimberly's estranged 13-year-old son in Missouri, who is in line to collect an inheritance. Roger Smith of 77 Sunset Strip plays Gene Blair, a kind family man living in the nearby mountains who agrees to adopt Kimberly's son after he is compelled to kill Kimberly in a shootout. Brian G. Hutton is cast as the ill-fated young gunfighter known only as \\"The Kid\\". In \\"Devil to Pay\\" (December 23, 1958), Sugarfoot arrives at an Arapaho trading post whose owner has been killed by an arrow. Though warned away by a small \\"devil doll\\" planted in his saddlebag, Sugarfoot stays to help a young Indian woman, Monah (Grace Raynor), and Grey Hawk (H.M. Wynant) keep the trading post in operation. Tol Avery plays Jim Case, a rival trading post operator; John Carradine is cast as Mathew McDavitt, Case's drunken cohort. =1959= In \\"The Desperadoes\\" (January 6, 1959), Sugarfoot c. 1870 visits his friend Padre John (Anthony George) at a Roman Catholic mission in South Texas, where he learns of a mysterious plot to assassinate Mexican President Benito Juarez. Abby Dalton and Jack Kruschen guest star in this episode as Elizabeth Bingham and Sam Bolt, a military officer with a Napoleonic complex. In \\"The Extra Hand\\" (January 20, 1959), in exchange for a horse and supplies, Sugarfoot becomes the traveling companion of a former Russian seaman, Alexi Sharlakov (Karl Swenson), soon to become an American citizen. When the two reach a mining ghost town in Kansas, Sharlakov searches for Vic Latour (Anthony Caruso) and Hank Bremer (Jack Lambert), who had tried to kill him and left him with only one arm. The \\"extra hand\\" is that of Sugarfoot, backing up Sharlakov in a showdown with Latour and Bremer. Wayde Preston, who played Christopher Colt on the ABC western Colt .45, appeared four times in that same role on Sugarfoot in the episodes dealing with \\"The Canary Kid,\\" a role also played by Will Hutchins. In the semi-comical \\"The Return of the Canary Kid\\" (February 3, 1959), Hutchins and Preston are joined by Don \\"Red\\" Barry as Arkansas, Richard Reeves as Blackie Stevens, and Sandra Edwards as Prudence, the Canary Kid's girlfriend who instead falls for the kindly Tom Brewster. The \\"Canary Kid\\" episodes began to transition the series to correct the deficiencies that Hutchins had explained in his letter to Orr. \\"The Mysterious Stranger\\" (February 17, 1959) features Adam West (Batman) as Frederick Pulaski, a declared descendant of the Polish military commander Casimir Pulaski, who was mortally wounded at the British Capture of Savannah, Georgia, in the American Revolution. Casimir Pulaski, \\"the father of the American cavalry\\", however, never married or had direct descendants and died at the age of thirty-four. In the story line, Frederick Pulaski is a concert pianist who defends oppressed Polish miners in a western town. After studying law under the deceitful Jay Hollis (Frank Cady), who take a fatherly interest in Tom Brewster, Sugarfoot befriends Pulaski in a legal hearing and reconciles him with the young woman by whom both are smitten, Kathy O'Hara (Sue Randall of Leave It to Beaver), who is also studying to be a concert pianist. Karl Swenson appears in this episode as Kathy's wealthy Irish father, Dennis O'Hara, who had mistakenly placed his full confidence in lawyer Hollis. Walter Burke plays a bartender in this episode. In \\"The Giant Killer\\" (March 3, 1959), Patricia Barry plays the recently widowed Doreen Bradley who with the assistance of Sugarfoot exposes to a grateful town the corruption and cowardice of Lou Stoner (R. G. Armstrong), a leading candidate for a territorial governorship but not before she threatens to blow up the town hotel. Stoner murdered Doreen's husband but with no witnesses to the crime. Russ Conway plays the town marshal. Dorothy Provine, John Litel in his second appearance on the series, and child actor Jay North of Dennis the Menace are cast, respectively, as Ada, Mr. Crenshaw, and Bobby. In \\"The Royal Raiders\\" (March 17, 1959), Sugarfoot comes to the aid of a young Frenchwoman, Yvette Marveux (Jacqueline Beer of 77 Sunset Strip), who asks him to hide valuable jewels after military men take over the train on which they are riding. Sugarfoot places the jewels in a coffeepot for safe keeping while the frightened passengers await their uncertain fate. Other guest stars are Dennis Patrick, Betty Lynn, and Joe De Santis as General Carlos Jose Perez. Don Dubbins guest starred in two consecutive Sugarfoot episodes. In \\"The Mountain\\" (March 31, 1959), he played \\"good guy\\" Vic Bradley, an escaped convicted murderer for whom Sugarfoot brings news of a new trial based on additional evidence uncovered in the case. Miranda Jones plays Bradley's Indian wife, Jean. The couple is hidden away in a mine shaft in a mountain, and much of the episode deals with Sugarfoot and Jean seemingly lost in a cave-in. Bradley's brother-in-law, Dixon White Eagle (Don Devlin), on his deathbed from a snake bite, confesses to the crime for which Bradley had been convicted, the killing of an old miner. In \\"The Twister\\" (April 14, 1959), Dubbins is cast as the \\"bad guy\\" Sid Garvin who comes into a quiet town looking for his estranged brother, a schoolteacher who calls himself \\"Roy Cantwell\\" (Fred Beir). Cantwell has hidden away $20,000 in loot from one of Garvin's robberies. Sugarfoot, a friend of Cantwell's, tries to free three children being held hostage at the school. Meanwhile, a tornado wipes out the schoolhouse and virtually the entire town though most of the inhabitants made it to safe shelter. Cantwell will not be around to rebuild; he dies from a shot fired by his brother, who with his loot finally in hand perishes in the storm. Betty Lynn returns for another appearance in the series, this time as Alice Fenton, Cantwell's friend who takes over the teaching duties after his death. Child actor Stephen Talbot delivers a compelling role as Ab Martin, Cantwell's prize pupil who at the end of the episode recites to his dying teacher part of Patrick Henry's 1775 address at St. Johns' Church. Richard Long, five months before he was cast in the ABC/WB detective series Bourbon Street Beat, appears as United States Army Capt. Clayton Raymond in \\"The Vultures\\" (April 26, 1959). Raymond faces court martial and certain execution for desertion at the fictitious Fort Rockwell prior to a deadly Apache attack. Following a trail of vultures‚Äîhence the episode title‚ÄîSugarfoot arrives at the fort, accompanied by a shaken Isabel Starkey (Faith Domergue), the wife of the fort commander, Colonel Starkey (Alan Marshal). Sugarfoot agrees to defend Captain Raymond, but his client refuses to tell what really happened in the matter. Philip Ober plays General Humphrey, who is determined to uncover the truth. In \\"The Avengers\\" (May 12, 1959), Sugarfoot is a passenger on the same stagecoach as Pike (Steve London), a murderer with a debonair appearance condemned to be hanged. Pike boasts that his brothers will quickly free him from his fate. A heavy thunderstorm compels the travelers to take shelter in a dark deserted cathedral inhabited by bats and mysterious occurrences. When the officer guarding Pike is shot, Sugarfoot finds the sniper, a prospector in an abandoned mine shaft of iron pyrites. Meanwhile, Pike never faces the noose but is shot and then crushed to death. Guest stars include Dorothy Provine, in a return appearance on the series, this time as Pike's sister Bonnie, Luana Anders as Princess, the young woman living in the cathedral with the prospector, Vito Scotti as the superstitious Acquistapace, and Chubby Johnson as the stage driver. In \\"Small Hostage\\" (May 26, 1959), Sugarfoot goes south of the border with Army Col. Cyrus Craig (Robert Warwick) to reclaim from a cemetery the body of Craig's military son killed in an Apache attack. While there, Pepe Valdez (Jay Novello), the owner of an orphanage, attempts to persuade Craig that the blonde boy \\"Chico\\" (Gary Hunley) is actually Craig's grandson, but Craig had never been informed that his son may have married and he doubts Chico's parentage. In \\"Wolf\\" (June 9, 1959), while working as the new foreman at the ranch of Belle Kellogg (Virginia Gregg), Sugarfoot come into contact with the troublesome but harmless Juf Wilkes (William Fawcett), whose poor family often engages in petty theft to feed themselves, with little said from sympathetic townspeople. Wilkes's estranged son, Wolf (Wright King), for whom the episode is titled, returns home to take over the homestead. In a gunfight, Wolf kills another rancher, Lee Spate (Ted de Corsia), who caused Juf's sudden death by poisoning beef that Juf had killed on Spate's property. Judy Nugent is cast as Charonne; Frank Ferguson in a return appearance, this time as Doc Spooner, and Tommy Ivo as Jed Wilkes.

P. Lovecraft. Written between November 1934 and February 1935, it was first published in the June 1936 issue of Astounding Stories. The story describes time and space travel by mind transfer. The premise is that a person in a given place and time can switch bodies with someone who is elsewhere or elsewhen. Other writers have re-used this concept in later works, such as drinking tea from Red Forest leaves in the television series 12 Monkeys and long-range communication stones in the Stargate SG-1 television series. As with other Lovecraftian works, this story features otherworldy alien beings that are not simply variations on humans or other familiar terrestrial animals. Plot The Shadow Out of Time indirectly tells of the Great Race of Yith, an extraterrestrial species with the ability to travel through space and time. The Yithians accomplish this by switching bodies with hosts from the intended spatial or temporal destination. The story implies that the effect, when seen from the outside, is similar to spiritual possession. The Yithians' original purpose was to study the history of various times and places, and they have amassed a \\"library city\\" that is filled with the past and future history of multiple races, including humans. Ultimately the Yithians use their ability to escape the destruction of their planet in another galaxy by switching bodies with a race of cone-shaped plant beings who lived 250 million years ago on Earth. The cone-shaped entities (subsequently also known as the Great Race of Yith) lived in their vast library city in what would later become Australia's Great Sandy Desert (). The story is told through the eyes of Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, an American living in the first decade of the 20th century, who is \\"possessed\\" by a Yithian. He fears he is losing his mind when he unaccountably sees strange vistas of other worlds and of the Yithian library city. He also feels himself being led about by these creatures and experiences how they live. When he is returned to his own body, he finds that those around him have judged him insane due to the actions of the Yithian that possessed his body. While he was experiencing a Yithian existence in Earth's ancient past, the Yithian occupying his body was experiencing a human one in the present day. The narrator at first believes his episode and subsequent dreams to be the product of some kind of mental illness. His initial relief at discovering other cases like his throughout history is withered when he discovers that the other cases are too similar to his own to be without a connection. The narrator's dreams become more vivid, and he becomes obsessed with archaeology and ancient manuscripts (as was the Yithian) - but lacks any sort of proof that would demonstrate whether he was (or is) simply mad. He discovers that the Yithians on Earth died out eons ago (their civilization destroyed by a rival, utterly alien pre-human race described as \\"half- polypous\\" creatures) but the Yithian minds will inhabit new bodies on Earth after humanity is long gone. His tenuously held sanity is challenged when he discovers the proof he seeks‚Äîand that not only do remains of the Yithians' past civilization still exist on Earth; but also still remaining are those who destroyed them. It is also mentioned that the current appearance of the Yithians is not the original; but one acquired during a previous mass- projection of the minds of their race when disaster beckoned, leaving the original inhabitants to die in the bodies of the Yithians. Characters *Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee: The narrator of the story, a Professor of Political Economy at Miskatonic University, and, from 1908 until 1913, a victim of the Great Race of Yith. He was born c. 1870. :There are autobiographical aspects to the character. The years of Peaslee's amnesia correspond to the timespan of Lovecraft's adolescent nervous breakdown, which forced him to drop out of high school and withdraw from society. During this period, Lovecraft suffered from facial tics, which may be reflected in the Yithian-possessed Peaslee's inability to control his facial muscles.Joshi and Schultz, p. 235. The feeling Lovecraft described, upon returning to Providence after living in New York City for two years, that he was \\"awakening from the queer dream about being away from home\\" has been called \\"the cornerstone upon which Lovecraft built his masterpiece, 'The Shadow out of Time'.\\"David E. Schultz, \\"Lovecraft's New York Exile\\", Black Forbidden Things, p. 56. But An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia, which calls Peaslee perhaps \\"the most thoroughly developed of HPL's characters\\", notes that there are parallels as well to Lovecraft's father, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, who also displayed eccentric behavior during a five-year period of madness.Joshi and Schultz, p. 201. *Wingate Peaslee: Son of Nathaniel Peaslee, also a Miskatonic professor. He is described by his father as \\"the only member of my family who stuck to me after my queer amnesia of long ago, and the man best informed on the inner facts of my case.\\" *William Dyer: A Miskatonic University geology professor who accompanies the expedition to Australia. See At the Mountains of Madness. The story mentions a number of victims of the Yithians' mind-swapping whom Nathaniel Peaslee recalls talking with, including: *Titus Sempronius Blaesus: A Roman \\"who had been a quaestor in Sulla's time\\". Sulla first became Consul in 88 B.C. and was dictator of Rome 82-80 B.C. A quaestor was a Roman financial official; Sulla reformed the office and raised their number from ten to twenty. *Bartolomeo Corsi: A \\"12th century Florentine monk\\". This character also appears in Phillip O. Marsh's 1994 novel The Worm Shall Ye Fight! *Crom- Ya: A Cimmerian chief who lived c. 15,000 B.C. This is a homage to Lovecraft's friend Robert E. Howard, whose best-known creation, Conan the Barbarian, hailed from Cimmeria and worshipped Crom. In Fred L. Pelton's 1989 short story \\"The Sussex Manuscript\\", Crom-Ya is said to be a worshipper of Tsathoggua. *Khephnes: \\"An Egyptian of the 14th Dynasty, who told me the hideous secret of Nyarlathotep\\". The 14th dynasty was about 1700 B.C. *Nevil Kingston-Brown: An \\"Australian physicist...who will die in 2518 A.D.\\" *Pierre-Louis Montagny: \\"An aged Frenchman of Louis XIII's time\\". Louis XIII was king of France from 1610‚Äì1643. *Nug-Soth: \\"A magician of the dark conquerors of 16,000 A.D.\\" *S'gg'ha: A being from \\"the Star-headed vegetable carnivores of Antarctica.\\" *Theodotides: A Greco-Bactrian official of 200 B.C. *James Woodville: \\"A Suffolk gentleman of Cromwell's day\\". Cromwell lived from 1599‚Äì1658, and was the English head of state from 1653 until his death. *Yiang-Li: \\"A philosopher from the cruel empire of Tsan-Chan, which is to come in 5,000 A.D.\\" Tsan-Chan is first mentioned by Lovecraft in the story \\"Beyond the Wall of Sleep\\". Inspiration S. T. Joshi points to Berkeley Square, a 1933 fantasy film, as an inspiration for The Shadow Out of Time: \\"Lovecraft saw this film four times in late 1933; its portrayal of a man of the 20th century who somehow merges his personality with that of his 18th-century ancestor was clearly something that fired Lovecraft's imagination, since he had written a story on this very theme himself--the then unpublished The Case of Charles Dexter Ward (1927).\\" Lovecraft called the film \\"the most weirdly perfect embodiment of my own moods and pseudo-memories that I have ever seen--for all my life I have felt as if I might wake up out of this dream of an idiotic Victorian age and insane jazz age into the sane reality of 1760 or 1770 or 1780.\\" Lovecraft noted some conceptual problems in Berkeley Square's depiction of time travel, and felt that he had resolved these flaws in his novella.S. T. Joshi, \\"The Horror on the Wall\\", The Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft. Other literary models for The Shadow Out of Time include H. B. Drake's The Shadowy Thing (originally published as The Remedy in 1925), about a person who has the ability to transfer his personality to another body; Henri Beraud's Lazarus (1925), in which the protagonist develops an alter ego during a lengthy period of amnesia; and Walter de la Mare's The Return (1910), featuring a character who seems to be possessed by a mind from the 18th century.Joshi and Schultz, pp. 234-235. A similar plot was used in the story Les Posthumes (1802) by Nicolas-Edme R√©tif, where the character the Duke of Multipliandre has the power to project his soul into other humans and through time and space across the universe. Reaction Lovecraft critic Lin Carter calls The Shadow Out of Time Lovecraft's \\"single greatest achievement in fiction\\", citing \\"its amazing scope and sense of cosmic immensitude, the gulfs of time it opens, [and] the titanic sweep of the narrative\\",Carter, p. 106. while horror author and critic Ramsey Campbell describes it as \\"awe- inspiring\\". Swedish Lovecraft expert Martin Andersson named the story as one of his four favorites and called it Lovecraft's \\"magnum opus\\". Lovecraft himself was dissatisfied with the effort, so much so that he mailed the original manuscript to August Derleth without taking a copy for himself. Cinescape Magazine rated the story to be one of the top 10 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books of 2001. Mark Squirek wrote in the New York Journal of Books that, \\"The complexity of Mr. Lovecraft‚Äôs story is enhanced by the art showcasing what he wrote‚Äîa great way for a novice reader to discover the work of H. P. Lovecraft.\\" Also, Publisher's Weekly wrote, \\"Lovecraftians will hail the publication of H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Out of Time.\\" Adaptations *The H. P.

She sometimes wrote under the name Kristin Hunter Lattany. She is best known for her first novel, God Bless the Child, published in 1964. Biography Hunter was born Kristin Elaine Eggleston in Philadelphia, to George L. Eggleston and the former Mabel Manigault, and attended Haddon Heights High School until 1947. When she was aged 14, she began writing a column about young people for the Pittsburgh Courier, continuing to do so until 1952, the year after she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where she received her bachelor's degree in Education (1951).\\"Kristin Hunter Lattany\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

It was spurred by then-Major John Boyd's 'energy-maneuverability' (E-M) theory, which indicated that excessive weight would have severely debilitating consequences on the maneuverability of an aircraft. Boyd's design called for a light-weight fighter with a high thrust-to-weight ratio, high maneuverability, and a gross weight of less than , half that of its counterpart, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. It resulted in the development of the General Dynamics YF-16 and Northrop YF-17. Late in the program, in 1974, with the promise of European sales, the Air Force changed the program name to Air Combat Fighter (ACF), and committed to purchasing 650 models of the YF-16, adopted as the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The U.S. Navy adopted a modified version of the YF-17 as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. History =\\"Missileers\\"= Project Forecast, a 1963 Air Force study, attempted to identify future weapons trends and \\"certain high-priority areas for research and development (R&D;), recommendations based on the greatest potential payoff for the future.\\"Schiriever, General Bernard A., USAF (Ret). \\"Technology and Aerospace Power in the 1970s.\\" Air University Review, September‚ÄìOctober 1969. The report strongly suggested that future air combat would be carried out primarily by long-range missile fire. Future \\"fighters\\" would be designed primarily for long range, high speed, and equipped with extremely large radar systems in order to detect and engage opposing fighters at beyond visual range (BVR). This made them much more like interceptors than classic fighter designs, and led to increasingly heavier and more technologically sophisticated designs ‚Äì and thus costlier. The US Navy had long ago come to similar conclusions, and had been designing a series of aircraft dedicated to this role. Notable among these was the well named Douglas F6D Missileer, a long endurance but slow and unmaneuverable design equipped with very powerful missiles and radar for fleet defense. The US Air Force had similar designs, but these had been dedicated to the interceptor role, where the large size of its targets allowed reasonable radar performance. As radar equipment improved, in particular the introduction of Doppler radar systems, fighters gained similar range performance against smaller targets. By the early 1960s, even before the release of Forecast, both the Air Force and Navy expected to use the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark (then still in development as the TFX) and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II for their long- and medium-range needs. The perception of a declining need for close-in \\"dogfighting\\" capabilities resulted in the original decision to not install internal cannons in the Phantom.Jenkins 2000.Richardson 1990. pp. 6‚Äì7. =Combat experience and E-M theory= However, real-world experience in the Vietnam War revealed some shortcomings in American fighter capabilities, as early generation Soviet jet fighters proved to be more of a challenge than expected for U.S. designs. Although U.S. pilots had achieved favorable kill- to-loss ratios, combat had revealed that air-to-air missiles (AAM) of this era were significantly less reliable than anticipated. Furthermore, the rules of engagement in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Under these conditions, combat invariably closed to short ranges where maneuverability and short-range air- to-air weapons became critical, even for dedicated interceptors like the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger.Higham, Robin and Carol Williams. Flying Combat Aircraft of USAAF-USAF (Vol. 2). Manhattan, Kansas: Sunflower University Press, 1978. . Based on his experiences in the Korean War and as a fighter tactics instructor, in the early 1960s Colonel John Boyd and mathematician Thomas Christie developed the Energy-Maneuverability (E-M) theory of the value of aircraft specific energy maintenance as an advantage in fighter combat. Maneuverability was the means of getting ‚Äúinside‚Äù an adversary‚Äôs decision- making cycle, a process Boyd called the \\"OODA\\" loop (from \\"Observation- Orientation-Decision-Action\\"). This approach emphasized an aircraft design capable of ‚Äúfast transients‚Äù ‚Äì quick changes in speed, altitude, and direction. A fighter that is superior in its ability to gain or lose energy while out-turning an opponent can initiate and control any engagement opportunity; a fast transient capability allows the pilot to stay inside a hard-turning opponent when on the offensive or to force an overshoot of an opponent when on the defensive. These parameters called for a small, lightweight aircraft ‚Äì which would minimize drag and increase the thrust-to- weight ratio ‚Äì but a larger, higher-lift wing to minimize wing loading ‚Äì which tends to reduce top speed while increasing payload, and can lower range (which can be compensated for by increased fuel in the larger wing).Hillaker, Harry. \\"Tribute To John R. Boyd.\\" Code One, July 1997. Retrieved: 7 June 2008.Hehs, Eric. \\"Harry Hillaker: Father of the F-16.\\" Code One, April and July 1991. Retrieved: 7 June 2008. =Lightweight Fighter program= YF-16 on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center The need for new air superiority fighters led the USAF to initiate two concept development studies in 1965: the Fighter Experimental (F-X) project originally envisioned a 60,000-pound (27,200 kg) class twin-engine design with a variable-geometry wing. This would be a very expensive aircraft, too expensive to consider equipping the entire Air Force with it as its standard aircraft. For this reason a less-expensive Advanced Day Fighter (ADF) was also considered, a lightweight design in the 25,000 lb (11,300 kg) class which would out-perform the MiG-21 by 25%.Jenkins 1998, p. 6. Boyd used his E-M theory to argue that the F-X design was far too heavy, and this led to new requirements for a smaller F-X in the 40,000-pound (18,100 kg) class.Jenkins 1998, pp. 7‚Äì8. However, the appearance of the Mach-3-capable MiG-25 in July 1967 led to serious concerns within the Defense Department that the Soviets had developed a super fighter capable of outrunning anything the US fielded, while its huge wing would make it highly maneuverable. In response, the ADF effort was essentially ignored in favour of an all-out effort to develop a superior F-X, which would emerge as the F-15 Eagle.Richardson 1990, p. 7. Boyd was unimpressed with the resulting weight growth in the F-15, and the shelving of the ADF. In the late 1960s he gathered a group of like-minded innovators that became known as the \\"Lightweight Fighter Mafia\\". In 1969, this \\"Fighter Mafia\\" was able to secure funds for a \\"Study to Validate the Integration of Advanced Energy-Maneuverability Theory with Trade-Off Analysis\\". General Dynamics received $49,000 and Northrop $100,000 study contracts to design concepts that embodied Boyd's E-M theory ‚Äì a small, low-drag, low-weight, pure fighter with no bomb racks; their work would lead to the YF-16 and YF-17, respectively.Richardson 1990, pp. 7‚Äì8.Coram, Robert. Boyd: the Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War. New York: Little, Brown, and Co., 2002. . Although the Air Force‚Äôs F-X proponents remained hostile to the concept because they perceived it as a threat to the F-15 program, the ADP concept (revamped and renamed as the \\"F-XX\\") gained civilian political support under the reform-minded Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard, who favored the idea of competitive prototyping. As a result, in May 1971 the Air Force Prototype Study Group was established, with Boyd a key member. Two of its six proposals would be funded, one being the Lightweight Fighter (LWF). The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued 6 January 1972, and called for a 20,000 lb (9,100 kg) class fighter with a good turn rate, acceleration and range, and optimized for combat at speeds of Mach 0.6‚Äì1.6 and altitudes of 30,000‚Äì40,000 ft (9,150‚Äì12,200 m). This was the region in which the USAF expected most future air combat to occur, based on studies of the Vietnam, Six-Day, and Indo-Pakistani wars. The anticipated average flyaway cost of a production version was $3 million.Peacock 1997, pp. 9‚Äì10.Richardson 1990, pp. 7‚Äì9. Five manufacturers ‚Äì Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Northrop, and Vought ‚Äì submitted proposals. The Vought V-1100 and the Lockheed CL-1200-2 Lancer were eliminated in March 1972. Though the Boeing Model 908-909 was initially most favored, it was quite similar in technology and appearance to the cheaper General Dynamics Model 401-16B. Since one of the goals of the program was to validate emerging technologies, Secretary of the Air Force Robert Seamans chose to select the General Dynamics and Northrop entries. The first YF-16 had its official maiden flight on 2 February 1974. The second YF-16 prototype first flew on 9 May 1974\\\\. This was followed by the first flights of the Northrop‚Äôs YF-17 prototypes, which were achieved on 9 June and 21 August 1974, respectively. The fly-off commenced in 1974 as both prototypes were delivered. The YF-16s would complete 330 sorties during the flyoff, accumulating a total of 417 flight hours; the YF-17s would accomplish 268 sorties.Richardson 1990, pp. 12‚Äì13. =Air Combat Fighter competition= Three factors would converge to turn the LWF into a serious acquisition program. First, four North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members ‚Äì Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway ‚Äì were looking to replace their F-104G fighter-bomber variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter interceptor; furthermore, they were seeking an aircraft that their own aerospace industries could manufacture under license, as they had the F-104G. In early 1974, they reached an agreement with the U.S. that if the USAF placed orders for the aircraft winning the LWF flyoff, they would consider ordering it as well. Secondly, while the USAF was not particularly interested in a complementary air superiority fighter competing with F-X, it did need to begin replacing its F-4 and Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers. In April 1974, U.S. Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger announced that the LWF program would be redirected to a multirole fighter design in the new Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition. ACF would not be a pure fighter, but more of a fighter- bomber, which essentially ended opposition from the F-X group. Finally, the U.S. Congress was seeking to achieve greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy. In August 1974, Congress redirected funds for the Navy‚Äôs VFAX program to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program that would essentially be a navalized variant of ACF. These requirements meshed relatively well, but the timing of the procurement was driven by the timeframe needs of the four allies, who had formed a \\"Multinational Fighter Program Group\\" (MFPG) and were pressing for a U.S. decision by December 1974. The U.S. Air Force had planned to announce the ACF winner in May 1975, but the decision was advanced to the beginning of the year, and accelerated testing.Richardson 1990, p. 14.Peacock 1997, pp. 12‚Äì13.Jenkins 2000, pp. 14‚Äì16, 19‚Äì20.\\"YF-16: The Birth of a Fighter.\\" F-16.net. Retrieved: 13 June 2008. ACF also raised the stakes for GD and Northrop because it brought in further competitors intent on securing the lucrative order that was touted at the time as \\"the arms deal of the century\\". These included the Dassault-Breguet Mirage F1 E (E for Europe) powered by a Snecma M53 engine and utilizing a fly-by-wire system similar to the one used in Dassault Mirage 2000 series. Only two prototypes were built for the ACF program,Grasset, Philippe. \\"Presentation: D√©jeuner-d√©bat du CHEAr\\". Paris: Centre des Hautes √âtudes de l'Armement (CHEAr), 27 November 2002. the Anglo- French SEPECAT Jaguar, and a proposed derivative of the Saab 37 Viggen named the Saab 37E Eurofighter (not to be confused with the later and unrelated Eurofighter Typhoon). Northrop also offered their earlier design, the P-530 Cobra, which looked very similar to its YF-17. The Jaguar and Cobra were dropped by the MFPG early on, leaving two European and the two U.S. LWF designs as candidates. On 11 September 1974, the U.S. Air Force confirmed firm plans to place an order for of the winning ACF design sufficient to equip five tactical fighter wings. The flight test program revealed that the YF-16 had superior acceleration, climb rates, endurance, and (except around Mach 0.7) turn rates. Another advantage was the fact that the YF-16 ‚Äì unlike the YF-17 ‚Äì employed the Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan engine, which was the same powerplant used by the F-15; such commonality would lower the unit costs of the engines for both programs.Richardson 1990, p. 13. On 13 January 1975, Secretary of the Air Force John L. McLucas announced that the YF-16 had been selected as the winner of the ACF competition.Peacock 1997, pp. 13‚Äì16. The chief reasons given by the Secretary for the decision were the YF-16's lower operating costs; greater range; and maneuver performance that was \\"significantly better\\" than that of the YF-17, especially at near-supersonic and supersonic speeds. However, in the Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) competition, the Navy announced on 2 May 1975 that it selected the YF-17 as the basis for what would become the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.Peacock 1997, pp. 14, 17‚Äì19, 33‚Äì34.Donald, David ed. \\"Boeing F/A-18 Hornet\\".

It located on the shores of St. Mary's Lake. Built in 1906 and a residence hall since 1966, Carroll is the smallest of the residence halls, housing around 100 undergraduates. Its mascot is the Vermin, and its colors are crimson and gold. The coat of arms is based on the Carroll family, adapted to the dorm colors. The hall is named after Charles Carroll, Founding Father and the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence.  History  Charles Carroll of Carrollton, namesake of Carroll Hall Carroll Hall was constructed in 1906 by Brother Charles Borromeo Harding and christened \\"Dujarie Institute\\" after Jacques-Fran√ßois Dujari√©. Dujari√© had founded in 1820 the Brothers of St. Joseph, who eventually on August 31, 1835 came under the control of Basil Moreau, CSC, and they developed into the Brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross. From then, it was used as a seminary for the Brothers of Holy Cross, the Dujare institute or scholasticate, where the novitiates studies and lived before professing their final vows. In 1920, Blessed Brother Andr√© Bessette lodged in the building, in room 306, a small plain chamber with white walls and a single window, which today has been incorporated in the suite occupied by the assistant rector. In 1966, the Brothers sold the property to the University of Notre Dame, and in the fall of 1966 around a 100 students moved in. Rev. Thomas McDonagh CSC was its first rector. In 1966, the building's name was changed to Carroll Hall, in honor of Charles Carroll. He is sometimes referred to as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America, although he was not involved in framing the United States Constitution. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and Confederation Congress and later as first United States Senator for Maryland. He was the sole Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence.\\"Charles Carroll, of Carrollton,\\" The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XXIV, 1899. Carroll was the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, and the longest lived. He was also the cousin of the first Catholic Bishop in the United States, Archbishop John Carroll, of which the University holds several memorabilia in the museum of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. The Carroll family has had a huge impact in the history of Catholicism in the United States and Notre Dame. The name Carroll Hall had originally been given to a dormitory for approximately 350 boys 13‚Äì17 years old that was located in the west wing of the Main Administration building, but it was suppressed in 1946 when the rooms were converted into office space and the name retired. Since 1966, Carroll has housed undergraduate male students, except briefly from 1970 until 1977, when it hosted graduate students. Ever since Holy Cross Hall was demolished in 1990, Carroll has been the only undergraduate dormitory on a lake. The current rector is Eric T. Styles, from Chicago, who received a BFA in Electronic Media from the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music and an MA in Applied Philosophy from Loyola University Chicago. he previously worked at The Theatre School at DePaul University and in Campus Ministry at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota in Winona.  Description  Carroll Hall lays on the southwest shores of St. Mary's Lake, from which it enjoys views of the Main Administration Building and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. In front of the building is Carroll Lawn, also known as Far Quad, and hosts a sand volleyball court, and i between the hall and the lake is a basketball court. The hall is a five-story building in yellow Notre Dame brick, with classical decorations and a simple unadorned facade. Its architect was Br. Charles Borromeo Harding, who also worked on Crowley, St. Edward's, and Corby Halls, and also on the Basilica. The first floor host mainly social spaces, with a large living room with portraits of past presidents, a kitchen, study rooms, the mailroom, and the chapel. The chapel is modern and simple, and is dedicated to St. Andr√© Bessette. The basement hosts a laundry room, a fitness room, and storage and utility spaces. The upper floors hosts the dorm rooms, which are mostly singles, doubles, triples and quads.  Traditions  Nicknamed the Vermin, Carroll Hall is known for its distance from the rest of campus, and is nicknamed 'Siberia' in the winter. It has the smallest populations of students and the largest rooms on campus. The distant location from the rest of the campus and the small size of the dorm, makes the community especially tight knit and has given rise to many traditions and unique features. Carroll Hall and FarQuad seen from St. Mary's lake Each year, before the first home football game, the approximately 35 First Years in Carroll dye their hair blond, in a tradition dubbed Vermin Go Gold, in support of the football team. On football Saturdays, the Hall's facade is draped with a huge banner displaying the text \\"GO IRISH\\". It is made out of 72 bed sheets, 52,000 staples, and 5 gallons of green paint, and it is raised up on Friday afternoons. Started in 1998 and held on the first Friday of December, Carroll Christmas is one of Notre Dame's best known signature events and is Carroll's signature event. Events feature the lighting a 40-foot Christmas tree, performances from on-campus groups like the Glee Club and Humor Artists, Christmas carols from all the Vermin, horse-drawn carriages on Carroll Drive, dance parties, a giant \\"C\\" hanging on the facade, and paper luminaries. Carroll residents also dress up as Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, and the elves to entertain the guests, which comprise around a 1000 students every year. In recent years, Carroll Christmas has featured an appearance by ESPN College Gameday Analyst Digger Phelps, an extremely competitive cookie contest, and a horse-drawn carriage from LaFortune student center all the way to Carroll. Previously, into the mid-1990s, Carroll Hall held an annual haunted house on the Friday closest to Halloween. Since 2015 (as part of AnToastal), Carroll has launched the Lakeside Music Festival, which takes place in the spring and it includes music by many different campus groups, food, sports, and other activities, and it raises money for the Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph's County. Other events include Third Floor Abs, a fitness program that has spread throughout campus, and Friday cookouts, which take place on the FarQuad in front of the lake. Carroll Hall's charity efforts go towards helping Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph's County, and Carroll residents volunteer to help kids with homework and provide school supplies.

The Gold Range is a Canadian hotel and bar located in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The Gold Range, on 50th Street, is a notorious location with a reputation stretching across the Canadian Arctic. It was built on the site of The Cave Restaurant and Central Apartments, (formerly The Veterans Restaurant and Rooming House) which was destroyed by fire in 1956. The Gold Range is commonly known as \\"The Strange Range\\", having housed a rough and tumble bar, strip joint, boarding house and cafe complex since it was completed during 1957. Grand opening of the 52-room hotel, cafe and cocktail bar was in May 1958. The News of the North, May 22, 1958 Jacob Glick was the original owner of the hotel and bar but slowly sold his interest to a variety of business partners in the late 1960s including Rocky Wagner and Harry Pysmenny. Newton Wong was the owner of the Gold Range Cafe, a popular Chinese cuisine destination. The Gold Range was the first bar to serve draught beer in the Northwest Territories in 1972.The News of the North, June 22, 1972 In 1977, entrepreneur Sam Yurkiw purchased The Gold Range. In 1988, The Gold Range sold more beer than any other bar in Canada, according to its former general manager, Harvey Bourgeois. In 1989, another report states that the bar was the third highest grossing bar nationwide; in 1991, it was reported to be second. \\"Never a dull moment working in the Gold Range\\" The Yellowknifer, August 2, 1989\\"Sam Yurkiw, Beer Baron of Yellowknife\\" Northwest Explorer, August/September 1991 The Gold Range was sold to Edmonton businessman Jay Park in 2007. On April 16, 2009, Sam Yurkiw died at age 83, but the bar and the beer live on. In 2011, the city announced that it was considering purchasing the lot on which the Gold Range is located. News articles began to appear about how this would put the bar at risk of closing. In popular culture In Mordecai Richler's 1989 novel Solomon Gursky Was Here, the protagonist Moses Berger makes several visits to the Gold Range during his trips to Yellowknife. Aritha Van Herk's novel The Tent Peg also begins in a Yellowknife bar which, while not named, is believed to be the Gold Range. In Kathy Reichs' 2012 novel Bones Are Forever, the Gold Range is mentioned during a trip to Yellowknife. In 2013, Yellowknifer John Henderson and his daughter built a replica model of the Gold Range Hotel entirely out of lego blocks. The lego model gained international interest on social media.

Propagation During the daytime, medium and high-powered mediumwave AM radio stations have a normal reception range of about 20 to 250 miles (32 to 400+ km), depending on the transmitter power, location, and the quality of the receiving equipment, including the amount of man-made and natural electromagnetic noise present. Long-distance reception is normally impeded by the D layer of the ionosphere, which during the daylight hours absorbs signals in the mediumwave range. As the sun sets, the D layer weakens, allowing medium wave radio waves from such stations to bounce off the F layer of the ionosphere, producing reliable, long distance reception of (especially) high- powered stations up to about 1,200 miles (2,000 km) away on a nightly basis. Aside from the more or less regular reception of certain high-powered transmitters, variable conditions allow reception of different stations at different times - for example, on one night a medium-powered broadcaster from Cleveland, Ohio may be audible in Duluth, Minnesota, but not on the following night. Much of the hobby consists in trying to receive and log as many of these stations as possible, identifying target stations and frequencies to listen to and log. Near or on the coastlines, trans-oceanic reception is quite common and a favored target of DXers in those areas. Very distant inter- continental DX from stations several thousands of miles away is possible even far inland, but may require exceptionally good conditions and a good receiver and antenna on the listening side. DX stations evaporate from the dial as the sun rises. However, sunrise and sunset (\\"SRS\\" and \\"SSS\\") periods can provide interesting loggings. MW DX in North America In the United States and Canada, stations on the mediumwave dial are spaced at 10 kHz intervals from 520 to 1710 kHz as prescribed since 1941 by the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. The tremendous number of radio stations in this region of the world and limited number of available frequencies means congestion is very common, and DXers may hear two, three, or more stations on the same frequency (especially on certain \\"graveyard\\" frequencies where many lower- powered stations operate). The most powerful stations in the two countries are Clear-channel station which can transmit with 50 kilowatts of power. Examples of stations in this category from the List of clear-channel stations are: WLS in Chicago on 890 kHz, KMOX in St. Louis on 1120 kHz, WSB in Atlanta on 750 kHz, WCCO in Minneapolis on 830 kHz, WWL in New Orleans on 870 kHz, CJBC from Toronto on 860 kHz, WABC in New York City on 770 kHz, WLW in Cincinnati on 700 kHz, WCBS, 880 kHz in New York City, and WTAM in Cleveland on 1100 kHz, all of which can be heard over much of the United States and Canada east of the Rocky Mountains. In the southern half of the United States, several Mexican stations can be heard. Many of these are called Border blaster stations because they program in English to reach the American market. Some of these operate with over 100 kW of power with highly directional antennae aimed northward to avoid interfering in the rest of Mexico. Many can be heard on a similar night-to- night basis. Many of these stations are also treaty allocated clear-channel stations, ensuring that there will be no interference or limited interference on the same frequency. Although some distant listeners may rely on such stations for non-DX purposes, such as to hear a certain talk show or sporting event, DX'ers generally log these stations when they begin the hobby and afterwards pay little attention to them while seeking out new, less powerful and well-heard stations, often with a few kilowatts of power or less, or unusually distant stations. Especially prized in the former category are receptions of distant traveler information service (TIS) stations, operated by the Department of Transportation to give visitors information. These stations typically run at very low powers (limited to 10 watts) and are only intended to cover small areas, but may travel thousands of miles under certain instances. Similar are the tiny radio stations operated by high schools. On the East Coast of the United States, it is not unusual for DX'ers to hear the high-powered European stations, which operate at 9 kHz intervals, rather than the 10 kHz in the United States, helping to reduce co-channel interference from domestic stations, from countries such as Spain and Norway. Stations from Africa and the Middle East are also often heard. The Pacific Coast of the US provides a similar opportunity with stations from Asian countries and Australia / New Zealand although a considerably longer distance must be covered. On both coasts, as well as in the middle portion of the country, \\"Pan-American\\" DX from Latin American and Caribbean nations is often sought and logged. The AM expanded band, or \\"X-Band\\" as MW DXers often call it (not to be confused with the range of microwave frequencies), runs from 1610 kHz to 1710 kHz. This is a relatively new portion of the mediumwave broadcast spectrum, with the first two applications for frequencies having been granted in 1997 . The lower density of stations in this area of the spectrum, as well as a lack of stations with more than 10 kW of power in the United States, has led to many DX'ers taking interest here. MW DX in Europe Stations in Europe often run higher power than American stations, sometimes several hundreds of kilowatts. Synchronous networks are also commonly used, with local transmitter stations often having less of a local identity than those in the United States and Canada. The wide variety of languages spoken over the DX'ing range, from Spanish to Arabic, adds an element of challenge to DXing in the region. Some stations in Europe have taken to Digital Radio Mondiale transmissions, requiring a receiver capable of demodulating such signals, or a computer loaded with special software coupled to the receiver. DX reception of North American stations has been observed on many occasions. CJYQ 930 kHz and VOCM 590 kHz (both from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador) are generally the easiest to receive, and their presence is taken as an indication that the reception of more distant stations is possible. North American stations whose frequencies are furthest from the 9 kHz multiples used in Europe are easier to receive, particularly since 24-hour broadcasting is normal in Europe. MW DX in Asia In the southern half of the China, Japan stations, some of which operate with over 200 kW of power, may be heard on a similar night-to-night basis. Many of these stations are also clear-channel stations, ensuring that there will be no interference or limited interference on the same frequency. Equipment While any radio covering the mediumwave (AM radio) band can be used for DX purposes, serious DXers generally invest in a higher-quality receiver, and often a specialised indoor tuned box loop or outdoor longwire antenna. At the lower end of the spectrum, a portable radio with a larger- than-normal internal ferrite core antenna designed for long-distance AM radio reception may be used, such as the discontinued GE Superadio, CC Radio, or the Panasonic RF-2200. The Sony ICF-SW7600G and the newer GR model are also excellent for budget minded MW dxing. More serious DXers may spend much more for a tabletop shortwave communications receiver with good performance on the lower mediumwave frequencies using an external antenna, such as the AOR 7030+, Drake R8/R8A/R8B, Icom R-75, or Palstar R-30. Various models by Hallicrafters, Hammarlund and even home-made models from Heathkit have been popular. In recent years, software defined radios have become more popular for mediumwave DX.http://forums.radioreference.com/software-defined-radio/268920-anyone- doing-mw-dx-sdr-whats-your-setup.html Radios like the Microtelecom Perseushttp://microtelecom.it/perseus/ and the Elad FDM-S2http://ecom.eladit.com/epages/990298944.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/990298944/Products/%22ELAD%20FDM-S2%22 can record the entire mediumwave band to a computer hard drive, which can then be played back and tuned later. With any such receiver, a high-performance loop antenna may be employed, or in the alternative, one or more outdoor longwire Beverage antennas, sometimes many hundreds of meters long. In order to cancel out reception of unwanted stations, some DX listeners employ elaborate phased arrays of multiple Beverage antennas. For trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific reception, where the target station is on a 9 kHz rather than a 10 kHz multiple or vice versa, receivers with narrow RF filters are useful in rejecting adjacent broadcasts on the listener's own continent. To combat noise, DXers may use an outboard noise attenuation device, or a radio with built-in digital signal processing capabilities. A personal computer with specialized logging software or simply a paper notebook is used to write logs. Recording devices can be used to archive memorable DX moments, or identify hard-to-hear station receptions after the fact.

After the war he moved to Kyiv and in 1965 wrote The Thoughts and the Heart, selling millions of copies. He was the recipient of multiple awards. In 2008 Amosov was placed second in their ranking of \\"our greatest compatriots\\" by the viewers of the TV show The Greatest Ukrainians.Yaroslav the Wise - the Greatest Ukrainian of all times, Inter TV (19 May 2008) Biography Amosov was born December 6, 1913. in the village Olkhovo (near Cherepovets) of Vologda Governorate, Russia to Russian peasants. In 1932 he graduated from Cherepovets Mechanical College, followed by 3 years of work as a shift mechanic at the Arkhangelsk electric power station. In 1939 he graduated from the Arkhangelsk Medical Institute, and in 1940 - with distinction from the All-Union Correspondence Industrial Institute. During World War II he was at the front as the leading surgeon of a field mobile hospital PPG-2266. From 1947 to 1952 he worked as chief surgeon of the Bryansk region and at that time he began to be widely engaged in thoracic surgery, he conducted extensive scientific work and in 1953 he presented his doctoral dissertation. In 1952, Amosov, as a prominent specialist in thoracic surgery, was invited to the Kyiv Institute of Tuberculosis, to guide specially created clinic of thoracic surgery. Here particularly fully revealed his many-sided talent of the surgeon and researcher, physiologist, and engineer, has been particularly fruitful scientific, organizational, practical, educational and social activities. Amosov was one of the initiators of the widespread introduction into our country surgery for diseases of the lungs, has made a lot of new developments in this problem. His research contributed to improving the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In 1961, Amosov was awarded Lenin Prize for the work of lung surgery. In the future, the main focus of Amosov's work was the heart surgery. In 1955 he was the first in Ukraine began treatment for heart diseases surgically, in 1958, one was one of the first in the Soviet Union to introduce into the practice the method of artificial blood circulation (in 1963), Amosov was first in the Soviet Union to perform the mistral valve replacement, and in 1965 for the first time in the world he created and introduced into practice the anti-thrombotic heart valves prosthesis. Amosov elaborated a number of new methods of surgical treatment of heart lesions, the original model of heart-lung machine. His work on the surgical treatment of heart diseases won a State Prize of Ukraine (1988) gold medals (1967, 1982) and Silver Medal (1978) of the Exhibition of Economic Achievements of the USSR. The clinic established by Amosov, produced about 7000 lung resections, more than 95000 operations for heart diseases, including about 36,000 operations with extra-corporeal blood circulation. In 1983 Amosov's cardiac surgery clinic was reorganized in Kyiv Research Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery and in the Ukrainian Republican cardiovascular surgical center. Each year, the institute fulfilled about 3000 heart operations, including over 1500 - with extra-corporeal blood circulation. Amosov was the first director of the Institute, and since 1988 - Honorary Director of the Institute. In 1955, Amosov created and headed the first in the USSR Chair of Thoracic Surgery for the postgraduate studies and later the Chair of Anesthesiology. These Chairs have prepared more than 700 specialists for Ukraine and other republics. Along with surgery Amosov paid much attention to contemporary problems of biological, medical and psychological cybernetics. From 1959 to 1990 he headed the Department of Biological Cybernetics in the Institute of Cybernetics. Under the leadership of Amosov fundamental studies of the self-regulation of the heart systems were conducted and the issues of machine diagnosis of heart disease were studied, elaboration and creation of physiological models of \\"internal environment\\", computer modeling of basic mental functions, and some socio-psychological mechanisms of human behavior were done. Innovative approach, the original views of Amosov were widely recognized in our country and abroad. For his research in the field of Bio-cybernetics in 1978 and 1997 he was awarded the State Prize of Ukraine. In the 1989 Soviet Union legislative election he was elected into the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union as an independent candidate in Kyiv (he had declared his support for People's Movement of Ukraine).The Ukrainian Resurgence by Bohdan Nahaylo, University of Toronto Press, 1999, (page 184) Amosov believed that the Western society should serve as an ideal for the USSR.Soviet Intellectuals and Political Power: The Post-Stalin Era by Vladimir Shlapentokh, Princeton University Press, 1990, (page 262) Amosov is the author of more than 400 scientific publications including 19 monographs. Some monographs reprinted in the U.S., Japan, Germany and Bulgaria. 40 doctoral degrees and over 150 PhD's of sciences were presented in his Institute, many of them are chiefs of major scientific centers in Ukrainian SSR and other republics of the Soviet Union.

Population: 65,000 (1969). History Borisoglebsk was founded in 1646 and was named for the Russian saints Boris and Gleb, the first saints canonized in Kievan Rus' after the Christianization of the country. In the late 19th century and the early 20th century Borisoglebsk developed into a busy inland port due to its geographic location within the highly fertile Central Black Earth Region. Barges transported good such as grain, timber, kerosene, fish, eggs, watermelon from the region to large cities in western and central Russia connected to Borisoglebsk by waterways such as St. Petersburg, Moscow, Rostov, Taganrog, and Tsaritsyn. In 1870, a brewer plant opened in the town, producing dark beer and light beer, as well as fruit soda. The brewery has survived and continues to produce beer. According to the 1885 census, the population of Borisoglebsk featured 13,007 inhabitants (6,325 males and 6,682 females), almost exclusively Russian Orthodox. In the early 20th century there was a mixed-sex gymnasium in the town, with 4 female classes and 6 male classes, and a technical railway school. In January 1906, revolutionary Maria Spiridonova assassinated G. N. Luzhenovsky at the Borisoglebsk railway station. After the Bolsheviks came to power in Borisoglebsk in 1918, one of the first concentration camps in Russia for \\"alien and petty-bourgeois elements\\" was organized in the town.

Although produced by Granada Television as a TV film, it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 16 January, a few days before its screening on ITV on 20 January, and then in selected London cinemas from 25 January. Though set in Derry, the film was actually shot in Ballymun in North Dublin. However, some location scenes were shot in Derry, in Guildhall Square and in Creggan on the actual route of the in 1972. Content The film was inspired by Don Mullan's politically influential book Eyewitness Bloody Sunday (Wolfhound Press, 1997). The drama shows the events of the day through the eyes of Ivan Cooper, an SDLP Member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland who was a central organiser of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march in Derry on 30 January 1972. The march ended when British Army paratroopers fired on the demonstrators, killing thirteen and wounding another who died four-and-a-half months later. In addition to the deaths, fourteen other people were wounded. The soundtrack contains only one piece of music, a live version of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" by U2 which plays over the closing credits. Casting and production Cooper is played by James Nesbitt, himself a Protestant from Northern Ireland. In recognition of the role his book played in achieving the new Bloody Sunday Inquiry, his book's role as inspiration for the movie, and the fact that he was a schoolboy witness to the tragedy, Don Mullan was asked by director Paul Greengrass to appear in the film as a Bogside Priest. A number of the military characters were played by ex-members of the British Army, including Simon Mann. Gerry Donaghy was played by Declan Duddy, nephew of Jackie Duddy, one of those killed on Bloody Sunday. Big Brother 2007 (UK) housemate Se√°ny O'Kane was also in the film.

Ruff was the author of Famine and Survival in America (1974), How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years (1979), Survive and Win in the Inflationary Eighties (1981), Making Money (1984), and other books. He updated and re- released his most successful book, re-titling it How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years in the 21st Century (2008). Career Ruff advised investors to avoid stocks and bonds and instead to put their portfolios into gold, silver, platinum group metals, and collectibles such as art and numismatic coins. He also advised his readers to store a year's supply of food in preparation for hard times. Ruff believed (as of his 1979-1981 writings) that the United States was headed for a hyperinflationary economic depression and that there was a danger that both government and private pension plans were about to collapse. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Ruff hosted a syndicated television show called Ruff House. During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, Ruff began appearing on CNBC making economic predictions that were similar to those he had made in the 1970s and 1980s.Howard Ruff on CNBC Issues Dire Warnings for Years Ahead Ruff gained a sizable mainstream audience for a while during the late 1970s until about 1981, because those who had been taking his investment advice and buying precious metals saw large capital gains during that period. The New York Times labeled Howard Ruff \\"The Prophet of Doom\\" after his book How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years reached the number #1 seller in 1979. His popularity fell off after the peak in the gold and silver speculative bubble in 1980.

Biography Born to a noble family of Petro Yakymovych Drahomanov who was of a Cossack descent, Mykhailo Drahomanov started his education at home, then studied at the Hadiach school, Poltava senior school and Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. He was also an uncle of Ukrainian poet Larysa Kosach (Lesya Ukrainka) and brother of Olha Drahomanova- Kosach (Olena Pchilka). Drahomanov's uncle, Yakiv Drahomanov, was a member of the Decembrist movement and political prisoner for participating in the secret Society of United Slavs.Yakiv Drahomanov at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine His wife was the famous actress Ludmila Dragomanova. The couple had one daughter, Lidia Shishmanova. During the transfer of Taras Shevchenko's remains from Saint Petersburg to Taras Hill, Drahomanov gave a speech over his tomb when it stopped in Kyiv. Drahomanov lectured at Kyiv University from 1870 to 1875, but because of the repressions against the Ukrainian movement peaking up in 1876 with Ems Ukaz was forced to leave the Russian Empire and emigrated to Geneva. In emigration he continued his political, scholarly and publishing activities. In 1885‚Äì95, he was a professor at the University of Sofia to his son-in-law Ivan Shishmanov. Drahomanov wrote the first systematic political program for the Ukrainian national movement. He himself defined his political convictions as \\"ethical socialism,\\" and was deeply impressed by socialist literature as a teenager. Hromada and Socialism 200px Drahomanov was one of leaders of Kyiv hromada (later known as the Old Hromada), while continuing to pursue his academic career.Mykhailo Drahomanov at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine Being a member of the Russian Geographic society, he established contacts with Ukrainians of Austria (in Galicia). Under his influence, the Academic Circle in Lemberg (Lviv) adopted the Ukrainian democratic platform. As a victim of anti-Ukrainian repressive measures by the Russian government, in 1875 Drahomanov was fired from the Kyiv University. In 1876 Drahomanov became a spokesman of Hromada abroad (Western Europe) while settling in Geneva, Switzerland. Between 1878-1882 he published a Ukrainian political magazine Hromada and number of Russophone pamphlets. Drahomanov also created a Ukrainian socialist organization the Geneva Circle. In 1886 his political stance became not aligned with the political views of Hromada, which resulted in a rift between then, and the society in Ukraine losing its financial support. Legacy The lasting legacy of Drahomanov can be discerned in the whole Ukrainian tradition of leftist political parties and political activism. He personally influenced a handful of younger Ukrainian intellectuals in Habsburg Galicia in the late 1870s, first of all Ivan Franko and Mykhailo Pavlyk, both of whom accepted his ideas although reworked them later according to their own mould. In 1890 these intellectuals founded the first Ukrainian political party - Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party. The program-maximum of this party was socialist and therefore the party can be seen as one of the first socialist parties in Eastern Europe. Drahomanov tried to popularize an orthographic reform, called the Drahomanivka after him. In 1991, the \\"Kyivan State Pedagogical University Named After Mykhaylo Drahomanov\\" in Kyiv was founded on the basis of the former \\"Kyivan State Pedagogical University Named After Maxim Gorky\\". In 1997, the university was granted \\"National University\\"-status. Literature #Hornowa E. Problemy polskie w tw√≥rczo≈õci Michala Drahomanowa. ‚Äì Wroclaw, 1978. #Rudnytsky Ivan L.

Early life Kobayashi was born in the Kanda district of Tokyo, where his father was a noted engineer who introduced European diamond polishing technology to Japan, and who invented a ruby-based phonograph needle. Kobayashi studied French literature at Tokyo Imperial University, where his classmates included Hidemi Kon and Tatsuji Miyoshi. He met Ch≈´ya Nakahara in April 1925, with whom he quickly became close friends, but in November of the same year, began living together with Nakahara's former mistress, the actress Yasuko Hasegawa. Kobayashi graduated in March 1928, and soon after moved to Osaka for a few months before moving to Nara, where he stayed at the home of Naoya Shiga from May 1928. His relationship with Yasuko Hasegawa ended around this time. In September 1929, he submitted an article to a contest hed by the literary journal Kaiz≈ç, and won second place. Literary critic In the early 1930s Kobayashi was associated with the novelists Yasunari Kawabata and Riichi Yokomitsu and collaborated on articles for the literary journal Bungakukai and became editor in January 1935. At that time Kobayashi felt literature should be relevant to society, with writers and critics practicing social responsibilities. His editorials covered a wide range from contemporary literature to the classics, philosophy, and the arts. He began to serialize his life of Fyodor Dostoevsky in the magazine. Around this time, he also published Watakushi Shosetsu Ron, an attack on the popular Japanese literary genre of the shishosetsu, the autobiographical novel or I Novel. From April 1932, he was also working as a lecturer at Meiji University and was promoted to professor in June 1938. By the mid-1930s, Kobayashi was well established as a literary critic. His aversion to abstract ideas, and conceptualizing in general, was widely known, as was his preference for spontaneity and intuition. In literature, he reserved his highest praise for the works of Kan Kikuchi and Naoya Shiga, whereas he expressed a low opinion of Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa for being too cerebral. He made Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture his home from 1931 and was a central figure in local literary activity. Wartime propagandist In politics, Kobayashi praised the writings of militant nationalist Sh≈´mei ≈åkawa. In November 1937, he wrote a strongly worded essay Senso ni tsuite (\\"On War\\"), which appeared in a leading intellectual magazine, Kaiz≈ç. In the essay, he lashed out at fellow writers and intellectuals who continued to oppose the growing war in China, sharply reminding them that their duty as subjects of the emperor took precedence over all else. It made little difference what the war is about, all that mattered was that it existed and must be dealt with. Kobayashi treated the war as if it were an act of nature, such as a storm, impervious to analysis and beyond human control. Just as a storm must be weathered, a war must be won, regardless of right or wrong. Kobayashi went to China for the first time in March 1938 as a special correspondent for the popular magazine Bungeishunj≈´, and as a guest of the Imperial Japanese Army. This was the first of six wartime trips to the continent, which took him through Japanese-occupied areas of eastern and northern China. In 1940, together with Kan Kikuchi and fifty- two other writers including Kawabata Yasunari and Riichi Yokomitsu, Kobayashi toured Japan, Korea, and Manchukou as members of the Literary Home-Front Campaign (Bungei Jugo Undo), a speech-making troupe organized by Kikuchi to promote support for the war. Later career Following the end of World War II, Kobayashi was sharply attacked by leftists for his collaboration with the Japanese military, but the US occupation authorities never filed any charges against him, and he was not even purged from public life. Kobayashi's reputation as a brilliant literary critic emerged from the war largely intact. He resigned from teaching at Meiji University in August 1946. An anthology of his works was awarded the Japan Art Academy Prize in 1951. In the post-war period, Kobayashi started a business as an antique dealer (amassing a considerable collection of Japanese art in the process), traveled to Europe, wrote essays and gave lectures on a huge variety of subjects, made radio broadcasts, took part in dialogues with writers, artists and scientists, and wrote about golf. His Watashi no jinseikan (\\"My View of Life\\") and Kangaeru hinto (\\"Hints for Thinking\\") became bestsellers. In 1958, Kobayashi was awarded the Noma Literary Prize for Kindai kaiga (\\"Modern Paintings\\"). Kobayashi became a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1959, and was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government in 1967. Kobayashi died of renal failure on March 1, 1983. His grave is at the temple of T≈çkei-ji in Kamakura.

Rojas's styles varied considerably throughout his life, and he displayed talents in painting that ranged primarily for dramatic effect, to works done in the impressionist style. Biography Crist√≥bal Rojas Poleo was born in the city of C√∫a in the Valles del Tuy to parents who worked in the medical profession. Part of his childhood occurred during the middle of the federal war (1859‚Äì1863) and C√∫a was particularly affected by the events of the war. He initiated studies under his grandfather, Jos√© Luis Rojas, who taught him how to draw and motivated him to improve. At 13 years old, his father died and he was forced to begin work in a tobacco factory in C√∫a to help support his family. In 1878, an earthquake devastated the Valles del Tuy region, and the Rojas faced poverty. As a result, he moved to Caracas where he continued his painting studies, despite again having to work in the tobacco industry to support his mother and family. In Caracas he attended classes by Jos√© Manuel Mauc√≥ at the Universidad Central de Venezuela. Between 1880 and 1882, he developed a keen interest in oils and displayed a primitive technique that would prevail in his later paintings such as Ruinas de C√∫a despu√©s del Terremoto and Ruinas del templo de la Merced. During this time he became acquainted with the painter Antonio Herrera Toro, also coming under contract as Toro's assistant to paint Caracas Cathedral. Rojas' La muerte de Girardot en B√°rbula which won him a silver medal and scholarship in 1883. 287 x 217 cm. In 1883, Rojas exhibited his La muerte de Girardot en B√°rbula (The death of Girardot in B√°rbula) in the Sal√≥n del Centenario to commemorate the birth of Simon Bolivar and won a silver medal in second place along with the painter Arturo Michelena. This award would grant him a scholarship by government amounting to 50 pesos each month, to study in Europe. In early 1884 he had moved to study in Paris where he established a friendship with Emilio Boggio. In the period between 1883 and 1890 Rojas would experiment slowly with different pictorial tendencies and techniques ranging from post-romanticism to impressionism. Melancholic, and with an uncertain temperament, Rojas was inspired by examples of artwork he discovered on his continuous visits to the Louvre. Between 1886 and 1889 he exhibited many paintings in the Paris City Hall, including La miseria (1886); El violinista enfermo (1886); La taberna (1877); El plazo vencido (1887); La primera y √∫ltima comuni√≥n (1888) and El bautizo (1889). With El Bautizo, a notable change in his work is observed. With a more acute perception of chromatic atmosphere, the painting displayed clear Dutch influences, a style which was also reflected in a later painting he produced in 1889 Dante y Beatriz a orillas del Leteo. Towards the end of 1889, Rojas moved away from the painting of dramatic effects which he had typically displayed at Paris Hall, and began to display talent for scenes and portraits, using colours and paying attention to details with impressionism. However, the subsidies for his scholarship would soon run out, and he became plagued with tuberculosis. He was forced to return to Venezuela in 1890, bringing with himself his last paintings, a portrait of President Juan Pablo Rojas Pa√∫l and The Purgatorio, a depiction of purgatory (both 1890). Soon after his return to Caracas, he died on November 8 of 1890, around 5 weeks before his 33rd birthday. Personality Rojas' El Purgatorio, a depiction of purgatory, painted shortly before his death in 1890. 339 x 256 cm. Journalist Ermelindo Rivod√≥ who visited Rojas in Paris in 1885, described the painter as \\"Somewhat pale, with small moustache and black hair, that emphasize his smooth set of melancholic eyes\\". Rojas was known for his reserved but highly passionate nature, rarely socialising with others around him and preferring to study art in his own medium. Peers and artistic commentators have consistently referred to him as \\"melancholic\\". Jose Antonio Hedderich, in an interesting article published in the National Magazine of Culture, after studying the life of Rojas described him; \\"He was of a shy character, that one was aware of the distance that existed between him and those who surrounded to him. He had few friends\\". However, Hedderich also continues to identify that Rojas was of a highly emotional nature. Once remarking that, \\"He had almost fatalistic temperament and was emphatically sad\\". According to Hedderich, Rojas was embittered by excessive guilty feelings about life and was acutely aware of his conscience. These feelings were often reflected in some of his works such as his purgatory painting, painted shortly before his death in the knowledge he was going to die from tuberculosis.

His selected writings have recently appeared in a three-volume edition. Born in a Polish-Lithuanian family in Dolynska village, Kherson Gubernia (Russian Empire), he studied in St. Petersburg, where he was involved in the socialist movement. After the revolution in 1905 he emigrated to Austro-Hungary and settled in Prague. In 1909 he graduated from Charles University (sociology, faculty of philosophy). At that time he was involved in the movement for abolition of the death penalty, and in this, as well as in the study of small nations movements, Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk was an inspiration for him. Before WWI Bochkovsky worked for several Czech journals, the most influential of which was Slovansk√Ω P≈ôehled (Slavonic Review), and also for the Ukrainian newspaper Rada (Council, Kyiv) and the Russian-language Ukrainskaia zhizn‚Äô‚Äô (Ukrainian Life, Moscow). At that time he combined political activity in a milieu of immigrants from the Russian Empire with the study of the sociology of the nation. He focused on so called \\"non-historical / non-state nations\\" or \\"enslaved nations\\" of the Russian Empire. At the outbreak of WWI Bochkovsky was imprisoned in Austria as a Russian citizen. His status was changed to that of interned person thanks to Masaryk's help. He was able to work on his first book in nationalities studies ‚ÄúEnslaved nations of the Russian Empire‚Äù (Ponevoleni narody Rosiis‚Äôkoii imperii, 1917). He also was publishing his articles in the ‚ÄúHerald of Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine‚Äù (Visnyk SVU, Vienna, 1917‚Äì1918). During 1918‚Äì1921 he served as the secretary of the Ukrainian diplomatic representation in Prague. When (again, with Masaryk‚Äôs support) the Ukrainian Engineering Academy in Podƒïbrady near Prague was established, Bochkovsky became professor of sociology at the Academy. During the interwar period Bochkovsky elaborated a theory in nationalities studies and named it natiology. First, like Masaryk, he focused on the cultural identity of small Eastern European nations, and then during the late 1920s he started to examine national movements in all of Europe. In the late 1930s he drew attention to Asian and African nations, foreseeing their national revivals. The main idea of his approach was his assessment that nation is the spiritus movens of modern history and that small nations, despite the efforts of imperial policies, would not assimilate. Being both a sociologist and political activist, Bochkovsky‚Äôs credo was: ‚ÄúThe obligation of sociology, whose purpose is to forecast, is to state this fact [that the nation is the main protagonist of modern history]. The obligation of politics is to draw actual conclusions from it in order to reconcile liberationist tendencies with the state‚Äôs autocratic and centralist traditions. To dream that this triumphant march of the awakened nations could be blocked by assimilationist or any other means would be a reactionary utopia. In this historic duel, the modern nation will defeat the old state just as the young state vanquished the theocracy of the church at the dawn of modern history.‚ÄùOl'gerd Ipolyt Bochkovs'kyi, ‚ÄúNatsionalne probudzhennia, vidrodzhennia, samooznachennia,‚Äù Vybrani pratsi ta dokumenty, vol. 1, p. 309. . Bochkovsky‚Äôs approach toward nationalism resembles those of Miroslav Hroch and Ernest Gellner, which gained popularity half a century later, in the 1980s. He published, mostly in Ukrainian and Czech, dozens of papers, brochures, and books presenting his approach. Bochkovsky was a member of the Foreign Delegation of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party, which belonged to the Second International. In 1933‚Äì1934 in Prague he headed the Committee of Support for Starving Ukraine and became the editor of the Bulletin Hlad na Ukraine (Famine in Ukraine). In 1933‚Äì1934 he published open letters to the former French prime-minister Edouard HerriotOl'gerd Ipolyt Bochkovs'kyi, Vybrani pratsi ta dokumenty, vol. 1 (Kyiv, 2018), 105‚Äì16. Ibid., 117‚Äì21. who ignored the Famine in Ukraine now often referred to as the Holodomor. Bochkovsky summed up his point of view in an essay entitled ‚ÄúEuropa invertebrata‚Äù (Spineless Europe)Ibid., 117‚Äì21. . In 1935 the Lviv newspaper Dilo (The Deed) carried his article ‚ÄúThe Moral Inflation of Our Age,‚Äù in which he generalized the moral lesson of the Holodomor for European civilization, pointing out its universal characterOl'gerd Ipolyt Bochkovs'kyi, ‚ÄúMoral'na infliatsiia nasho√Ø doby,‚Äù Dilo, nos. 292‚Äì94, October 31‚ÄìNovember 2, 1934. . In January 1934 Bochkovsky wrote ‚ÄúFamine in Ukraine‚Äù for the use of the Ukrainian Press Bureau. Translations into Western languages were planned, but ultimately the project was not carried out. ‚ÄúThe world,‚Äù he asserted, after a thorough enumeration of publications about the Holodomor in the world press, ‚Äúwas not badly informed about the catastrophic famine in the land of Soviets. It is another matter that it did not react actively to this disaster; it did not give actual assistance to the population dying en masse on that side of the Soviet border.‚Äù He described what he saw as the key problem facing the Old Continent at the time of the Holodomor: ‚ÄúPreviously Europe would react to what happened and how. Now it is mainly interested in where something happened and to whom. Depending on that, it either remains silent or reacts.‚Äù _________________ Ol'gerd Ipolyt Bochkovs'kyi, Vybrani pratsi ta dokumenty[Selected Works and Documents].

Established as Jevr√° Kedush√° in 1894, its mission was conceived to promote the well being and development of Jewish life in Argentina and to secure the continuity and values of the Jewish community. The association established one of Buenos Aires' first Jewish cemeteries, and later founded the Tsedak√° Foundation for charity. Serving the largest Jewish community in Latin America by the 1920s, AMIA inaugurated a new headquarters in the Balvanera section of Buenos Aires in 1945. AMIA became the headquarters of the Federation of Jewish Argentine Communities. It grew to provide and sponsor a variety of formal and informal educational, recreational, and cultural activities, as well as a health care cooperative. It became a center for participation and involvement for people of all ages in Jewish life, and in the community at large. On July 18, 1994 (the 10th of Av in the Hebrew calendar), a Renault Trafic van loaded with 300 kg of explosives smashed into the AMIA, killing 85 people (67 in the building itself and 18 who happened to be on the sidewalk or in a neighboring building), injuring over 300, and destroying the building completely. Following the 1994 AMIA bombing, a series of federal and international investigations were launched. Though the case remains unresolved, high-ranking members of the government of Iran were indicted, and in 2007 Interpol's general assembly issued ‚Äúred notices‚Äù for five Iranian officials. An 8,000 m¬≤ (85,000 ft¬≤) center was later commissioned to replace the destroyed structure, and in May 1999, the new building, a modernist 8-story structure separated from the street by a protective wall, was inaugurated. Furthermore, it has the biggest job vacancies of Argentina directed to Jewish and non-Jewish people with more than 500,000 applicants in its database.

Another brother, Willie, had a tryout with the Syracuse Chiefs in 1941. As a teenager, Rosen was a top player in Toronto's Jewish Fraternal Softball League. Rosen drove to Tampa, Florida, to try out with some minor league professional baseball teams, but he was told he was too small (5 ft 9 in) and returned to Toronto to play for the St. Mary's senior team.

In that season, he also had the distinction of being the first Canadian-born major leaguer to be named to the All-Star Game. Three games into the 1946 season, Rosen was traded to the Dodgers' cross-town rivals, the New York Giants. It would be his last year in the major leagues. That year he suffered a career-ending clavicle injury upon crashing into a fence. Before the end of the season, he was sent down to the Jersey City Giants of the International League.

Self- loading pistols are similar, but intended to be held and fired by a single hand, while rifles are designed to be held with both hands and fired from the shoulder. Evolution Early breech-loading firearms were single-shot devices holding a single cartridge. When that cartridge had been fired, the person using the firearm would remove the empty cartridge, find another cartridge from a pocket or other carrying apparatus, and load that cartridge into the firearm chamber before another shot could be fired. Later repeating rifles and pistols were equipped with a magazine holding several cartridges with a spring to push those cartridges into position to be loaded by manually operating the action of the firearm, and avoiding the procedure of locating and manually positioning each new cartridge. Later self-loading firearms avoid manual operation of the action by using energy of the cartridge being fired to operate the action, so the shooter may fire additional cartridges without manually operating the firearm action until the magazine is empty. Variations Self-loading rifles include: * Semi-automatic rifle, a type of firearm which fires a single shot with the pull of a trigger, and uses the energy of that shot to chamber the next round. Examples: ** Remington Model 8 ** Winchester Model 1907 * Automatic rifle, a firearm that automatically loads and fires rounds, through the bullet's energy, as long as its trigger is held down. Examples: ** Lewis gun ** Bren light machine gun * Selective-fire rifle, e.g. assault rifle, that is capable of switching between semi-automatic, fully automatic and/or burst fire mode of operation including: ** M16 rifle ** AK-47 Sources Category:Rifles ru:–°–∞–º–æ–∑–∞—Ä—è–¥–Ω–∞—è –≤–∏–Ω—Ç–æ–≤–∫–∞ ","title":"Self-loading rifle"},{"id":"3032013","text":"Peru competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

Founded in 1971 by Karl Berger, Ingrid Sertso, and Ornette Coleman, it brought together leading innovators in the jazz and world music communities. Unprecedented in its range and diversity, CMS providing participants with a rare opportunity to interact personally with musical giants of improvisation and musical thought on a daily basis. At CMS, the concept of 'Worldjazz' was born: the improvisational and compositional expansion of the world's musical traditions. Now one of the main driving forces in many styles of music, this concept was pioneered very early at CMS, guided by authentic leaders. Hundreds of live concerts were recorded, many heralded as landmark performances. Thousands of workshops, master classes, concerts and colloquia inspired a generation of musicians who took with them the ideas, concepts and practices developed at CMS. The CMS community still exists in a network of creative musicians, many of whom came to CMS from Asia, Europe and South America. In 1981, the organization celebrated its 10th anniversary at a concert titled the \\"Woodstock Jazz Festival\\". The CMS facility closed in 1984. CMS's World Jazz Encounters program (in the United States, Germany, Italy, Brazil, West Africa, India, the Philippines and Japan) survived. 2013 saw the re-establishment of the Creative Music Studio's intensive workshop programs, with sessions in the spring and fall in Big Indian, New York. In addition, the Creative Music Foundation (the non-profit organization under which the Creative Music Studio operates), began efforts to digitize the immense archive of recorded performances recorded during CMS workshops and special events.  History  In 1971 musicians Karl Berger, Ingrid Sertso and Ornette Coleman founded the Creative Music Foundation. Its initial advisory board, composed of legends from all aspects of music, the arts and philosophy, included composer John Cage, conductor/musician Gil Evans, philosopher/educator Buckminster Fuller, composer George Russell, painter Willem DeKooning and composer/conductor Gunther Schuller. Their goal was to establish a nonprofit organization focused on improvisation and musical cross-pollination that complemented musicians‚Äô academic studies, a place where music as a universal language could be explored and expanded. They called it the Creative Music Studio, or CMS. Established in New York as a 501(c) 3 nonprofit organization, for most of its 40 years, the organization's main program was the Creative Music Studio, a physical location in Woodstock, NY where musicians from all over the world lived, played, interacted with each other and created a body of music broad and deep. Based on a 45-acre campus with multiple residences, workshop rooms and performance halls, hundreds of Guiding Artists, including several MacArthur ‚ÄòGenius‚Äô Award winners (George Lewis, John Zorn, Cecil Taylor, John Cage, Charlie Haden), lived, played and shared musical wisdom with thousands of participants, many of whom are now well-known musicians, from Steven Bernstein and Cyro Baptista to Peter Apfelbaum and Marilyn Crispell. Over 550 concerts were recorded and were digitized as part of the CMS Archive Project. In 2012, Columbia University Library purchased the CMS Archive to preserve it for posterity. Some of the performances in the Archive are included in recordings made available to the public. Two three-CD sets were produced in 2014 and 2015 and garnered rave reviews from critics worldwide, including being named ‚ÄòBest Historical Release‚Äô by Cadence and Jazz Times magazine. Even without a physical \\"campus,\\" CMS has been remarkably active. Rob Saffer, who served as executive director from 2010 to 2017, helped spearhead resurgence in CMS programming. In addition to the CMS Archive Project and CD compilations, CMS Programs include the CMS Oral History Project, a partnership with Columbia University Jazz Studies Program; Improvisers Performances; ongoing residencies, workshops and performances in New York City, Woodstock and around the world. In 2013, CMS began hosting residential workshops in the Catskills after not offering any for several years. The organization takes over the Full Moon Resort to conduct its four-day workshop intensives. Artists at these workshops included MacArthur Fellows Vijay Iyer and Steve Coleman, 2016 Pulitizer Prize winning composer Henry Threadgill, Dave Douglas, Joe Lovano, John Medeski and Steven Bernstein, among many, many others. A CMS Scholarship Program has enabled roughly half of workshop participants to receive full or partial scholarships, helping musicians from Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Israel, Poland and the USA attend workshops. In 2018, Billy Martin assumed the position of president of CMS.  CMS Timeline 1965-2018  1965-1966 ‚Ä¢ Karl and Ingrid come to New York.

He wrote under numerous pen names, each with a unique personality, and caused a sensation with the sheer brilliance of his fiction, non-fiction and translations.  Early life  Born on Sado island, Niigata prefecture, Hasegawa was the brother of novelist Shir≈ç Hasegawa. His older brother was a painter, and his younger brother was a translator of Russian literature. His father was a newspaper journalist, and relocated to Hakodate in Hokkaid≈ç, where Hasegawa was exposed at an early age to a cosmopolitan environment with many foreign influences. He was accepted at Meiji University in Tokyo, but in 1918 quit his studies and travelled to the United States on the Nippon Yusen steamer Katori Maru, and worked as a cook while studying at Oberlin College in Ohio. It is not certain whether or not he actually graduated, but in August 1920, he decided to leave school and experience life by wandering all over the United States sightseeing and taking notes on his experiences. In 1924, he returned to Japan by working his way on cargo vessels, via South America, Australia and Dalian in the Kwantung Leased Territory, from which he went overland via Korea back to Japan. He intended to return across the Pacific to complete an around-the-world journey, but was refused a visa due to increasingly restrictive immigration rules by the United States, and decided remain in Japan to try his luck as a writer.  Literary career  Soon after his return to Japan in 1924, Hasegawa used the pen-name of and submitted stories to the literary magazines Shin-Shonen (New Youth) and Ch≈´≈ç K≈çron (Central Review) starting in 1925. The same year, he married Kazuko Katori, who was an English translator. Lacking money, the couple lived in a rented room in a small temple in the Zaimokuza neighborhood of Kamakura, while Hasegawa worked as a lecturer at the nearby Kamakura Women's Upper School. However, his efforts as an author were successful, especially stories with a humorous twist, which grew into a popular series describing cosmopolitan life based on his experiences in the United States, called Meriken Jappu. The first volume in this series, Jappu shobai orai (A Jap Businessman's Guide) was published in 1927. Hasegawa also wrote semi-historical novels under the pen- name , which were serialized in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun and Osaka Mainichi Shinbun. In Shimpan Ooka Seidan (1927‚Äì1928), his main protagonist was Tange Sazen, a one-eyed, one-armed super-swordsman. The character was an immediate best-seller, and was quickly adapted for the cinema, with four studios competing simultaneously to issue screen versions of Hasegawa's stories beginning in 1928. In 1928, Ch≈´≈ç K≈çron sponsored a round-the-world trip for Hasegawa, together with his wife, lasting for one year, in exchange for essays and stories set in each port of call. The couple visited fourteen countries, and during this time, Hasegawa used the pen-name , to write true- life mystery novels, and stories about sophisticated city life in Tokyo and other locations, which drew in a large female fan base. His wife also wrote articles about London and Paris during this trip, which were published in the women's literary magazine Fujin K≈çron (Women's Review). On his return to Japan, Hasegawa was offered the use of a suite at the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo, but from 1929 settled in Kamakura, where he remained until his death in 1935 of acute bronchial asthma. His grave is at the temple of Myohon-ji in Kamakura. References *Campbell, Alan. Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia . Kodansha (1993). *Standish, Isolde. New History of Japanese Cinema.

Jumpstyling is often referred to as \\"Jumpen\\": a combination of the English word 'Jump' and the Dutch and German suffix '-en' (meaning \\"to jump\\", or \\"jumping\\"). It originated in Belgium but gathered bigger popularity in their neighbouring country the Netherlands in the 2000s. History Jumpstyle, originally known simply as jump, was created in Belgium. It was a short-lived small genre that did not gain popularity in its original form. However, it came back to the public during the turn of the century, and fandom began increasing throughout Europe after undergoing significant changes in Germany in early 2003. After acquiring its current name, jumpstyle was reintroduced in Europe and in 2005 saw artists and groups producing and releasing its music. The first key stage of its popularity came between 2007 and 2008 due to the success of music videos such as Scooter's \\"The Question Is What Is The Question?\\" and \\"Jumping All Over the World\\", which led to their 13th studio album reaching number 1 in the UK charts. However, there are still some radio stations left, broadcasting jump in its traditional form. The oldest jumpstyle radio was founded in 2005 and still exists today under the name of JumpStation.FM. The style has also been fused with other genres, for example, Major Lazer and The Partysquad mixed a unique track with a jungle vocal sample in the track \\"Original Don\\", with jumpstyle/hardstyle influences. Also, Joel Fletcher's remix of Savage's 2005 single \\"Swing\\" uses jumpstyle influences. Tournaments and leagues There are various jumpstyle leagues across the world; mostly in the form of online video submissions and internet competitions. However, in Belgium there have been staged tournaments such as the European Jump Masters. The UK was the first to officially establish online leagues to an international level, with the FIJL (First International Jumpstyle League), but support was lacking, and many competitors pulled out, leaving much confusion. On the upside, this sparked several International Leagues in countries such as Australia, Russia, Germany and Spain. Music Jumpstyle music is an offspring of tech-trance, hardstyle, gabber and m√°kina. Its tempo is usually between 140 and 150 BPM. However, it cannot be seen as merely a slowed down version of gabber. It is characterised by a 909 kick drum used in a four on the floor beat. It also has influences from hard house and electro house. Starting around 2002‚Äì03, jumpstyle began to gain influence from hardstyle sound, such as pitched basslines set at a melody, more complex, multiband distortion, and synthesizers utilising square waveforms.

It was described by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820, with no subspecies recognised. It has long been classified in its own genus owing to its distinctive elongated beak, though genetic analysis shows that it lies within the lineage of the Psephotellus parrots and that its closest relative is the mulga parrot (Psephotellus varius). Not easily confused with other parrot species, it has a bright crimson crown, green- yellow cheeks, and a distinctive long bill. The wings, back, and long tail are dark green, and the underparts are purple-blue. The adult female is very similar though sometimes slightly duller than the male; her key distinguishing feature is a white stripe on the wing under-surface. Juveniles are predominantly green. Found in woodland and open savanna country, the red- capped parrot is predominantly herbivorous, consuming seeds, particularly of eucalypts, as well as flowers and berries, but insects are occasionally eaten. Nesting takes place in tree hollows, generally of older large trees. Although the red-capped parrot has been shot as a pest and has been affected by land clearing, the population is growing and the species is considered of least- concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has a reputation of being anxious and difficult to breed in captivity. Taxonomy The red-capped parrot was first described in 1820 by German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl as Psittacus spurius, from an immature specimen collected in Albany, Western Australia on the Baudin expedition (1801‚Äì1803) and housed at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The specific epithet spurius is the Latin adjective meaning \\"illegitimate\\", and refers to the markedly different adult and immature plumages (hence appearing unrelated). Irish naturalist Nicholas Aylward Vigors named the species Platycercus pileatus in 1830 from an adult male specimen that had been acquired by the Zoological Society of London. English artist Edward Lear illustrated the live specimen in his 1830 work Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots. It was placed in the monotypic genus Purpureicephalus‚Äîas P. pileatus‚Äîby French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The generic name is an amalgam of the Latin purpureus \\"purple\\", and the Ancient Greek kephal√© \\"head\\". In this generic combination, the current name is translated as \\"bastard red-head\\". The species name pileatus was generally used until German naturalist Otto Finsch followed Kuhl in using the specific name spurius, calling it Platycercus spurius in 1868. His countryman Anton Reichenow classified Purpureicephalus as a subgenus of Platycercus before placing it in the genus Porphyreicephalus (later corrected to Porphyrocephalus), until 1912, when Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews re-established the genus as Purpureicephalus. The red-capped parrot's elongated bill and its unusual coloration‚Äîlack of cheek patches compared with Platycercus‚Äîare the main reasons for its placement in its own genus. No subspecies are recognised currently. Mathews tentatively described a subspecies carteri in 1915 from a specimen collected at Broomehill on the basis of darker upperparts and greener cheeks; it was not considered distinct by later authors. There is no known geographical variation; five birds from Esperance had smaller bills and tarsi than individuals from elsewhere in its range, but the sample was too small to draw any conclusions. Lear's 1832 illustration The red-capped parrot is related to other broad- tailed parrots, but relationships within the group had been unclear. In 1938, Australian ornithologist Dominic Serventy proposed that it was the sole survivor of a lineage of eastern Australian origin, with no close living relatives. In 1955, British evolutionary biologist Arthur Cain proposed that the eastern lineage had vanished after being outcompeted by the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), and that its closest relative was the horned parakeet (Eunymphicus cornutus) of New Caledonia, which he concluded had adopted a much greener plumage of a wetter climate. A 2011 genetic study including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA found that the red-capped parrot was closely related to the mulga parrot (Psephotellus varius), the two lineages having diverged in the Miocene. The combined lineage itself diverging from one giving rise to the hooded parrot (Psephotellus dissimilis) and golden- shouldered parrot (Psephotellus chrysopterygius). \\"Red-capped parrot\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). English ornithologist John Gould used the name \\"red-capped parakeet\\" in 1848 based on Vigors' scientific name, which also inspired the old avicultural term \\"pileated parrot\\". It has also been called \\"western king parrot\\" to distinguish it from the Australian king parrot (Alisterus scapularis) occurring in the east, \\"purple-crowned parrot\\", \\"grey parrot\\", or \\"hookbill\\" for the distinctive upper mandible. The name \\"pileated parakeet\\" potentially causes confusion among aviarists with the South American pileated parrot (Pionopsitta pileata). Gould also reported \\"blue parrot\\" as an early colonial name. The name \\"king parrot\\" has persisted in Western Australia, English naturalist W. B. Alexander commenting that it was always known by this name in a field note in 1917, Pizzey reiterated this in a 2012 birding guide. Names in the Nyungar language, spoken by people of the southwest region, have been recorded at: Perth, Djar-rail-bur-tong and Djarrybarldung; King George Sound, Jul-u-up; Stirling Range, Chelyup; and Southwest, Djalyup. A recommended orthography and pronunciation list of Nyungar names has proposed daryl [char‚Äôrill], djarrailboordang [cha‚Äôrail‚Äôbore‚Äôdang], and djayop [cha‚Äôawp]. Description The red-capped parrot has a long bill and bright, clear patterned plumage, variously described as magnificent, gaudy, or clownishly coloured. Measuring in length with a wingspan, and weighing , the adult red- capped parrot is a distinctive and easily recognised medium-sized parrot. The adult male has a crimson forehead and crown, which extends from the gape or base of the lower mandible through the eye and grey-brown lores. Its hindneck and cheeks are green, and its ear coverts are more yellow-green. In March and April, the crown feathers and ear coverts of birds with new plumage can have fine black edging. The feathers of the head, back and underparts, have grey bases that are generally hidden. The upperparts, including the wings, are dark green, the rump yellow-green, and the tail is green with a dark blue tip. The underparts are purplish-blue, the flanks green and red, and the iris dark brown with a dark grey eye ring. The bill is pale blue-grey with a dark grey tip, its upper mandible elongated to a slender hook. Adult female, showing green spotting of red flanks The colouring of the female is similar to, though slightly duller than that of the male; the red of its plumage is not as intense and its red flanks are spotted with some green and yellow. Its breast is a more greyish shade of violet than purple. In flight, it has a whitish stripe visible on the underside of the wing. Female birds have white spots on seven or more underwing feathers, although a few of both sexes lack spots entirely. Birds with white spots on fewer than seven wing feathers can be either female or subadult male. The male has a slightly wider and flatter head, noticeable when birds are compared directly with each other, as well as longer wings and tail. Adult moulting takes place in the Southern Hemisphere summer and autumn. The red-capped parrot perches and walks with a distinctive upright posture. Juveniles have greenish plumage overall, before beginning their first moult around August. Their subsequent plumage much more closely resembles that of adult birds. The faintly seen markings of the adult pattern begin as a dark green crown, with a reddish frontal band, the grey-violet of the female breast, and red underparts mottled green. The bill is more orange, but turns the pale blue-grey of adult birds by two to five months of age. Juvenile birds with white spots on ten or fewer feathers on the wing undersurface are male, while those with more cannot be sexed. Male subadults often have residual white spots on their wing feathers. The rapidly repeated contact call has been transcribed as krukk-rak or crrr-uk, while the alarm call consists of a series of high-pitched loud notes. Male birds chatter loudly when agitated or marking their nest territory, but, unlike rosellas, not while feeding. Nestlings and fledglings up to two weeks post leaving the nest make a high-pitched two-syllable food begging call. Distribution and habitat The red-capped parrot occurs in the Southwest Australia ecoregion in dense to open forest and woodland, and heathland in coastal regions. The distribution range is south from Moore River to the coast to Esperance. Records of the species extend inland from the southern coast, as far as Gingin and Mooliabeenee. Within its range, it is sedentary in areas of higher rainfall, and locally nomadic in dryer areas. The red-capped parrot mostly occurs within of the coastline, becoming sparser further inland. The usual habitat is eucalypt forest or woodlands, but its distribution is mostly associated with marri (Corymbia calophylla). This tree species provides a constant food source and has increased in range and population since the settlement of Europeans. The parrot can be found in vegetation dominated by other tree species such as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), tuart (E. gomphocephala), wandoo (E. wandoo), yate (E. cornuta), and peppermint (Agonis flexuosa). A seed-eating bird, it is encountered in farmland, orchards, and suburban landscapes in Perth. It also occurs around remnant stands of marri conserved as shade trees on farmland in the western Wheatbelt and Swan Coastal Plain. It can be adversely impacted by land clearing and removal of trees. The red-capped parrot uses large trees to roost in at night and retire to during the middle of the day. It generally avoids blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) and pine plantations. The parrot is frequently observed at lake reserves in suburban areas on the Swan Coastal Plain, within sight of waders (Charadriiformes) occurring at freshwater to brackish wetlands. It is common at the Forrestdale and Thomsons Lakes Ramsar Site, Bibra Lake, and the Benger Swamp wetland, a region rich in avian species. It is also found at the Dryandra Woodland, another species-rich reserve with the stands of jarrah and marri over sheoak (Allocasuarina huegeliana) and dryandra (Banksia ser. Dryandra) that are known to be favoured. Red-cap parrot is commonly sighted at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and along roadsides around the Stirling Range and Porongorups. Behaviour The parrots are found in pairs or small groups of 4 to 6 individuals, or occasionally in larger flocks of 20‚Äì30 birds. Rarely a flock of up to 100 birds may be encountered; these are generally composed of juveniles. Birds may associate with Australian ringneck parrots (Barnardius zonarius) or western rosellas (Platycercus icterotis). The red-capped parrot is shy, and often retreats to the upper canopy of trees if disturbed, which has made study of its breeding and social behaviour difficult. Hence many aspects of these are poorly known. The red-capped parrot is thought to be monogamous, pairs forming long-term bonds generally from around 20 months of age. Younger females have been recorded pairing with older males at 8 or 9 months old, but do not appear able to breed at this age. The male initiates courtship by following the female and making a contact call, as well as performing a courtship display. This involves it raising its crown feathers, ruffling its crown and rump feathers, lowering its wings to display its rump, and raising and flaring its tail feathers. The female often stoops low and gives out a food-begging call. These displays begin before a nest site is chosen and continue through the breeding season until around two weeks after the young have fledged. =Breeding= Juvenile in Perth, Australia The breeding season is August to December. The red-capped parrot needs mature trees large enough to have hollows in the trunk or branches. These trees can be on road verges, along water courses, or in paddocks, as well as forest or woodland. Nests are generally apart, and pairs defend them vigorously from other birds, particularly other red-capped parrots, for the duration of nesting. The nest site is a tree hollow generally in an older large tree, such as a marri, jarrah, tuart, flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis) or paperbark (Melaleuca spp.), at a height between , averaging around above the ground and often north or east-facing. A lower entrance, narrow with a larger hollow, recorded at was considered exceptional. There are often chew marks at the entrance, which is wide. The hollow is deep and is lined with wood dust at the bottom. The female incubates her clutch of usually five, occasionally six (records up to nine), milk-white eggs. The size of each almost spherical egg is . The male attends her from a nearby tree, signalling to leave the nest for food he has brought. Information on the incubation period is limited, but is between 20 and 24 days. The nestlings are nidicolous‚Äîthey remain in the nest initially, weighing at birth and gaining, on average, a day. At birth they are covered in white down, which is soon replaced by grey down. Their eyes open by 9‚Äì11 days of age, and primary quills appear by 9‚Äì15 days and primary feathers proper by 14‚Äì20 days. They are fed by the female alone for the first two weeks, then by both parents. They fledge between 30 and 37 days, generally all leaving the nest on the same day. The parents continue to feed them for another two weeks. =Feeding= Adult feeding on Grevillea seeds Marri seeds are the preferred diet, but it also extracts seeds from karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), woody pear (Xylomelum), Grevillea, Hakea, dryandra (Banksia) and sheoak (Casuarina, Allocasuarina), mangite (Banksia grandis), as well as from grasses, herbs, or shrubs associated with marri-dominated vegetation types. The beak of this parrot allows more precision to obtain seeds from a eucalypt's capsule, the tough case of marri is chewed through by the ringneck parrot or cleaved by the powerful beak of cockatoos (Cacatuidae species). The immature fruit of marri is also consumed. A grass species‚Äîwild oats (Avena fatua)‚Äîand acacia are grazed for green seed. Records of feeding on acacia seed pods include Acacia celastrifolia, A. dentifera, A. oncinophylla and A. restiacea, which occur in its range, and stripping pods for small seed of cultivated Acacia merinthophora. The nectar filled blooms of kangaroo paws (Anigozanthos sp.) are also sought out, although, unlike the honeyeater and spinebill, their weight breaks the long stalk when feeding. Any viable seed that is consumed may be undigested and dispersed. Although the red-capped parrot eats fewer introduced plant species than other parrots, it does eat the seeds of slender thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus), sheep thistle (C. tenuiflorus), and variegated thistle (Silybum marianum). The species has also adapted to exploit the introduction of orchard fruit such as apples and pears and the gardens of suburban areas. The red-capped parrot bites predominantly red-skinned apples, attempting to retrieve the seed from inside. It does not eat the flesh but instead squeezes it to drink the juice. The fruit of other cultivated introductions are also selected, including almond, nectarine, olive, peaches, plums, pomegranates, and white cedar (Melia azedarach). Insects such as psyllids also form part of their diet. Insect larvae and lerp are also consumed, particularly in late winter and spring during its breeding season. The red-capped parrot primarily feeds on the ground, clasping the capsule of eucalypts or cones of sheoak with one foot and extracting the seed with their slender hooked beak. The dexterity it exhibits using its foot and beak to dislodge seeds is also shown by the long-billed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudinii). The two occur in the same habitat, both specialising in extracting the marri's store of large seeds. Both species prise marri seeds out of their woody capsule by manipulating it with the foot and lower mandible, and inserting the point of the upper mandible at openings in the seed-dispersing valve. The marks left by the lower mandible on the marri's nut distinguish it from those fed on by other parrots and cockatoos. The red-capped parrot leaves shallow marks around the opening of the capsule, with little damage to the husk. The species mainly feeds and manipulates objects with its left foot; limited sampling of Australian parrot species indicates that laterality is associated with larger size, and many of these are left-footed, though two other broad-tailed parrot species (crimson rosella and Australian ringneck) are right-footed, and smaller species show no preference. Parasites and diseases A parasitic protozoan, Eimeria purpureicephali, was isolated and described from a diseased bird in 2016. It is an intracellular parasite that lives in the host's gastrointestinal system. Species of bird louse recorded on the red-capped parrot include Forficuloecus palmai, Heteromenopon kalamundae and a member of the genus Neopsittaconirmus. Psittacine beak and feather disease virus was isolated and sequenced from a fledgling in 2016. Conservation Due to damage to orchard crops, these birds have been classified and shot as pests, although 1985 fieldwork in orchards around Balingup showed that the damage they inflicted was insignificant. Local government acts in the agricultural districts of Collie and West Arthur proclaimed them vermin in 1943. Despite this, its population is growing, possibly due to existing areas being degraded to a more favourable habitat. On account of this and its large range, it is considered to be a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though it has declined in the shires north of Perth as marri forests have vanished with urban development. Like most species of parrots, the red- capped parrot is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. Aviculture Its attractive colours make the red-capped parrot a desirable species to keep, although it has a reputation for being anxious in captivity and difficult to breed. This may be because of historically high proportion of wild-caught birds entering aviculture.

He was educated at Westminster School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he pursued legal studies. He was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1879. However, he abandoned the legal profession to pursue a career in journalism instead, writing primarily for the Morning Post and The Times. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, while living in France at his father's house in Honfleur he attempted to enlist with the French Army near Rouen, but was turned down as he was an alien. In 1878, he explored Albania and Montenegro, returning to the Balkans during the Russo-Turkish War. In 1889 Knight sailed to the island of Trindade off the coast of Brazil in a 64-foot cutter named the Alerte. He was in search of treasure. (He had previously visited the island in his first boat the Falcon I). He wrote the book The Cruise of the Alerte about his journey with detailed descriptions of Trindade. He was an influence on children's author Arthur Ransome who used Knight's book Sailing to teach himself how to sail; and in the Swallows and Amazons series as a resource for his fictional characters, who often refer to Knight on Sailing. Ransome also used Knight's descriptions of Trindade as a model for his fictional Crab Island in the book Peter Duck. Erskine Childers was another author who was influenced by Knight's writing. He used The 'Falcon' in the Baltic as material for his book The Riddle of the Sands.Bloom, Clive \\"Spy Thrillers: From Buchan to le Carr√©\\", p. 32, Macmillan, 1990, During 1890, Knight visited Kashmir and went travelling in the Himalayas to gather material for his book Where Three Empires Meet. He visited Ladakh and went on to Gilgit. He arrived in Gilgit in time to become involved in the 1891 British campaign against the minor states of Hunza and Nagar, led by the Resident, Col. Algernon Durand.See Knight, Where Three Empires Meet and A.C.Durand, The Making of a Frontier. He was temporarily appointed an officer in charge of some native troops, and acted as a correspondent for The Times. Knight subsequently covered Kitchener's Soudan Expedition, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in Cuba, the French expedition against Madagascar, the Anglo-Boer War. He was severely wounded in South Africa during the Battle of Belmont, resulting in the amputation of his right arm. In 1894 he had visited the new territory of Rhodesia just as Cecil Rhodes was conquering Matabeleland in south-western Rhodesia and his assessment of the country, presented in a series of articles written for The Times, later appeared in book form under the title of Rhodesia of Today. From 1904‚Äì1905, he covered the Russo-Japanese War, as a reporter embedded within the Imperial Japanese Army.Roth, p. 267. He was mistakenly reported as killed in action by The New York Times, which ran his obituary on 4 June 1904.New York Times June 4 1904 Knight died in 1925 after a long retirement.

This maneuver is also known as a smuggler's turn, powerslide, or simply a bootlegger. Technique The turn is performed by putting the vehicle quickly into a lower gear, usually the second gear, and quickly turning the wheel in the direction of the opposite lane. If performed correctly, the vehicle will enter a controlled skid, enter the opposite lane, and turn completely around. In a perfect bootleg turn, the car will be at a complete stop at the end of the maneuver and ready to accelerate and depart in the opposite direction. It is easier to initiate this with some cars by applying a flick of the steering wheel the wrong way initially, before turning it in the direction the driver wants to go. This maneuver (known in racing as a Scandinavian flick) increases the load transfer to the outer wheels. Classic bootleg turns can be performed only on cars with a manual transmission and are most easily accomplished with a rear wheel drive car, as the spinning back wheels aid in the turn. This is because the maneuver is essentially a controlled fishtail-like spin-out. Vehicles with an automatic transmission can be modified to make a bootleg turn possible. This is a most common modification for stunt vehicles used in motion pictures, to reduce the stress on the stunt driver to change gears while turning. Cars with a handbrake connected to the rear wheels can enter a controlled turning skid by employing the handbrake, locking the wheels, and turning the steering wheel sharply in either direction. This maneuver can also be called a bootleg turn, but is more precisely described as a handbrake turn. Using the handbrake to break the traction of the rear wheels is much simpler than trying to do this by power alone. Origins The name of the turn originates from the Prohibition era of the United States, when bootleggers transporting illegal liquor would use the maneuver to escape from police officers. Bootleggers were notorious for using modified high-speed cars to transport their goods and for using daring driving maneuvers to escape authorities. The man credited with inventing the bootlegger turn is Robert Glenn \\"Junior\\" Johnson, who ran liquor from his father's moonshine still and went on to become a highly successful NASCAR racer. Other nations and languages have their own colloquial names for the maneuver. For instance, it is known as \\"Cavalo-de-pau\\" (wooden horse), \\"Baianada\\" (a pejorative reference to the state Bahia) in Brazil. Related A \\"moonshiner's turn\\", or J-turn, begins instead with a stationary automobile accelerating straight backward for a few seconds before the steering wheel is turned quickly to complete a skidded 180 degree turn. In popular culture The presidential limousine performs an emergency bootleg turn near the start of \\"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part I\\", the first episode of season 2 of U.S. television series The West Wing. In the film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, a ship under the command of Captain Jack Sparrow does a bootleg turn by lassoing a nearby rock outcrop and swinging around it, which a character refers to as a \\"bootleg turn\\", centuries before the term was coined. Although this term is wrongly applied, it is a spin on a period- correct term of club hauling.

Early life Born in Hakodate, Hokkaid≈ç, Kon Hidemi was the younger brother of writer, politician and Buddhist priest Kon T≈çk≈ç. His father was a captain of a steamer operated by Nippon Yusen, and the family relocated to Kobe from 1911. Kon moved to Tokyo in 1918, and was accepted into the French Literature Department of Tokyo Imperial University. His classmates included Hideo Kobayashi and Tatsuji Miyoshi, During this period, he became interested in drama, visiting the Tsukiji New Theater, and took part in stage plays as a member of the Kokoroza, a theatrical company created by kabuki and stage actors as an effort to create a more modern version of traditional Japanese theater. One of its members was Tomoyoshi Murayama, and Sabur≈ç Moroi assisted with the music. After graduation, Kon obtained part-time jobs at a number of literary magazines, including Bungei Shuto and Bungakukai, providing essays, translations of Andr√© Gide, and literary criticism. He was hired as a lecturer by Meiji University in 1932. However, he quit in 1935 to devote his attentions to the direct the movie Dancing Girl of the Peninsula (Hanto no Maihime), starring Choi Seung-hee at the new Shink≈ç Kinema. He also wrote the screenplay for the movie. Kon visited Paris for half of 1937, and returned to his former position at Meiji University in 1939. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he maintained a correspondence with Mu Shiying, a Chinese writer who hoped that cultural exchange would help bring peace to Asia. In November 1941, Kon was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army; however, the army recognized his talents and assigned him to the press corps in Japanese-occupied Philippines. He returned to Japan once on leave, but was sent back to the Philippines in December 1944. Eight days after his arrival, the situation quickly turned sour for the Japanese forces as American forces began their landings. Kon hid in the mountains of Luzon for five months with several narrow escapes from death in combat while reporting on the fleeing Imperial Japanese Army. He escaped the Philippines on a jury-rigged Type 100 Command Reconnaissance Aircraft to Taiwan, and was flying in a DC-3 from Taipei to Fukuoka when word came of the surrender of Japan. Literary career While serving as director of the art department within the Ministry of Education from 1945‚Äì1946, Kon created the Japan Arts Festival, now an annual event for the promotion of cultural activities, especially Japanese literature. In 1946, Kon returned to Manila again, this time as a witness for the war crimes trial of Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma. In 1949, Kon published Sanchu Horo (\\"Wandering in the Mountains\\"), a story based on his wartime experiences in the Philippines, which marked the start of his literary career. He received the Naoki Prize for his short story, Tenno no Boshi (\\"The Emperor's Hat\\") in 1950. Kon's other biographical works include Miki Kiyoshi ni Okeru Ningen no Kenkyu, a fictional biography of the philosopher Miki Kiyoshi, and Yoshida Shigeru, about the life of the post-war Prime Minister of Japan. He lost his sight in one eye due to retinal detachment in 1966. In June 1968, Prime Minister Eisaku Sat≈ç asked Kon to accept the newly created position of Director of the Agency for Cultural Affairs. He served in this position for four years. From October 1972, he was also chairman of the Japan Foundation, a post which he held for eight years. During this time, his achievements included organizing an exhibition of art works from the Louvre in France, including the Mona Lisa, in return for an exhibition of the treasures of T≈çsh≈çdai-ji in Paris. Kon was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasures in 1974. In 1978, the Japanese government designated him a Person of Cultural Merit. He was also made honorary director of the National Theatre of Japan in 1980. Kon moved to Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture around 1931. After a temporary move to Tokyo after World War II, he returned to Kamakura, where he lived from 1951 until his death in 1984 at the age of 81. His grave is at the Catholic Cemetery in Kamakura.

History Sussex Records was launched in December 1969 by Avant, who had previously set up another mainly black music label, Venture Records for MGM. An offshoot of Buddah Records, initially it was located at 6430 W Sunset Blvd in Hollywood, at the corner of Sunset and Cahuenga Blvds. In 1972, it moved to 6255 W Sunset Blvd, Suite 1902. All records were distributed by Buddah Records until 1974 when Sussex switched to independent distribution until its closure. The company folded in July 1975, due to unpaid state and federal taxes amounting to $62,000: the Internal Revenue Service padlocked the offices and auctioned off all assets. Many of the label's master tapes went missing and were presumed destroyed. Rights to the catalog were acquired in a bankruptcy action by Tom Ficara and Combined Artists. Bill Withers was the label's best- selling artist with a string of pop and R&B; hits and several successful albums. They included three million-selling singles, \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" (#3 pop, #6 R&B;, 1971), the label's only chart-topper, \\"Lean On Me\\" (#1 pop and #1 R&B;, 1972) and \\"Use Me\\" (#2 pop and #2 R&B;, 1972). His recordings, many self-written and produced, were later purchased by Columbia Records, when Withers signed for the label in 1975. In 1971, the label notched another gold disc with Detroit guitarist, Dennis Coffey who reached #6 pop and #9 R&B; with hit, \\"Scorpio\\". The Presidents vocal group had a major hit for Sussex in 1970 with \\"5-10-15-20\\" (#5 R&B;, #11 pop), produced by Van McCoy. The group from Washington DC had released the label's first single, \\"For You\\", a minor R&B; hit, a few months earlier. In 1972 another awesome guitarist was signed named Eddy Senay who had a hit called \\"Hot Thang\\" and Eddy also covered the Bill Withers hit \\"Ain't no Sunshine. Later the hit \\"Cameo\\" started to break out worldwide as a popular hit with his fans around the world. After Sussex folded, Avant went on to form another record company, Tabu Records. Sixto Rodriguez Signed to Sussex Records in 1970. After the move to Sussex, his professional name was changed to simply Rodriguez. Rodriguez recorded two albums with Sussex, Cold Fact in 1970 and Coming from Reality in 1971. But after both sold very few copies in the US, he was quickly dropped from the label.

He lived in Franklin until 1966, when he left for the Millard School, a preparatory school located in Bandon, Oregon. The Millard School was a preparatory school for the service academies, in particular the United States Air Force Academy. =Education= Hoover attended Franklin Area High School in Franklin, Pennsylvania, and the Millard School in Bandon, Oregon, which prepared him for entering the United States Air Force Academy, where he was a cadet from 1967 to 1969. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, where he received his BA in 1972 with concentrations in the classics and philosophy.University of Texas at Austin transcripts (512) 475-7689 Between 1973 and 1975, he studied German philosophy and language at the Universitaet Hamburg.

In 1998, Hoover married a Mississippi native and they have one daughter, Hannah Kathleen HOOVER, who was born on December 2, 1999. Before launching Hoover Capital Management in 1989, Hoover spent four years as a stockbroker in Germany, where he was a registered representative in the Hamburg, Germany, office of United States stock brokerage company Bache & Co., known in Germany as Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Model & Roland GmbH. This was followed by 11 years as a registered representative in Bache's Boston office. Bache & Co was acquired by Prudential Financial in 1981 and became known as Prudential Bache Securities, Inc., later renamed simply Prudential Securities, Inc. Wachovia acquired Prudential Securities, Inc., in 2003. Hoover hired John Christopher (\\"Chris\\") Wade in HCM's Kansas City, Missouri, office to provide support services, especially portfolio management software support. Wade had previously been employed by Advent Software Inc. of San Francisco, California, and claimed knowledge of the Advent Portfolio Management systems. As such, Wade was tasked with maintaining portfolio performance and related data at Hoover Capital. In September 2001, Wade questioned whether Hoover might have been making transfers between entities controlled by Hoover and unrelated outside third parties that were possibly not authorized. Taking documents that might have supported his tenuous case, Wade resigned and became a self-styled whistleblower. Attorneys representing Hoover and HCM defended the case and vigorously denied any wrongdoing, and Wade was viewed as a disgruntled \\"snitch\\" who was hoping to help manufacture a case for a whistleblower reward. The legal case against Hoover, HCM, and Chestnut Fund LP remains the subject of ongoing debate, with many believing the case never should have been brought, as there were no clear improprieties. One analysis of Hoover's activities was made in 2004 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission while attempting to enact certain regulatory changes to rules governing private investment vehicles.https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2333.htm  Current activities  Between May 2008 and May 2010, Hoover divided his time between Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida, Mobile, Alabama, and Mississippi. Ponte Vedra Beach is best known as being the location of the Players Golf Championship at Sawgrass , the annual U.S. golf tournament with the largest purse on the Professional Golfers Association tour. In October 2007 Hoover began regular postings to a blog in his name , and the blog was active as of the summer of 2012. He practices Bikram Hot Yoga.

While Strachan filled in on drums with the group ‚Äì initially they played new material under the pseudonym The Longnecks ‚Äì they continued auditions for a new drummer. Strachan later reflected that the early shows as The Longnecks \\"were more nerve-wracking than the big shows... There's always going to be guys in the crowd going, 'I can't wait to see him fuck up'. But I was very lucky in that Chris and Scott never treated me as 'that ring-in bloke'\\". On 20 March 2002, it was officially announced on The Living End website that he had joined the line-up, and his first release with the group was an extended play, One Said to the Other in January 2003, followed by their third studio album, Modern Artillery, in October. For the album, Strachan shared songwriting credits on \\"Short Notice\\" with Cheney and Owen. Allmusic's Johnny Loftus picked it as one of the album's best tracks, \\"1977 Upstarts colors won't wilt, even in the face of crackly drum programming and vocal filters. It's a representative song for a problematic yet still promising album stuck between engineered formula and real deal rock\\". Modern Artillery peaked at number three on the ARIA Albums Chart, while, in February 2006, their next studio album, State of Emergency reached number one.

The Catholic Encyclopedia clarifies: :Detraction is the unjust damaging of another's good name by the revelation of some fault or crime of which that other is really guilty or at any rate is seriously believed to be guilty by the defamer. :An important difference between detraction and calumny is at once apparent. The calumniator says what he knows to be false, whilst the detractor narrates what he at least honestly thinks is true. Gravity According to J. Delaney of Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"Detraction in a general sense is a mortal sin, as being a violation of the virtue not only of charity but also of justice. It is obvious, however, that the subject-matter of the accusation may be so inconspicuous or, everything considered, so little capable of doing serious hurt that the guilt is not assumed to be more than venial. The same judgment is to be given when, as not unfrequently happens, there has been little or no advertence to the harm that is being done.\\" As in the case of stealing, detraction is a sin which demands restitution, even though rebuilding a victim's reputation may be nearly impossible. A commonly cited parable in this regard concerns a priest, often said to be Philip Neri, who gave a woman who had confessed to spreading gossip the penance of retrieving feathers that had been scattered on the wind‚Äîa task as impossible as undoing the damage she had done.  Controversies involving detraction  Some have thought Catholics need to guard better against the sin of detractionDetraction in public life than they are currently.

Spring of the Judge) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located in the Menashe Heights region around 25 km southeast of the city of Haifa, close to Yokneam, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megiddo Regional Council. In it had a population of . Ein HaShofet was established by two groups of Hashomer Hatzair graduates from Poland and Highland Mills, New York. They first settled the hill of Jo'ara in 1937 and later settled in the kibbutz' current location in 1938. \\"Ein HaShofet,\\" literally, Judge's Spring, was named in honor of United States Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis (1856-1941), who played a leading role in the American Zionist movement.About Ein HaShofet There is a flowing spring nearby the kibbutz. The kibbutz owns three industrial companies which produce metal parts, mostly for vehicles, and lighting products on a global scale.  Geography  Ein HaShofet is located on the Menashe Heights, 5 kilometers south of the city of Yokneam Illit. Other places near Ein HaShofet include the kibbutzim of Ramat HaShofet, Dalia and the hill of Jo'ara. The kibbutz is accessed through the 6954 and 6953 roads, connected to Highway 66 and regional route 672. History  =Prior to the establishment of the settlement= The founders of the kibbutz came from two groups. The first group was called \\"Banir\\" and consisted of Hashomer Hatzair graduates from Poland. The group formed in 1931 in Czƒôstochowa and arrived to Mandatory Palestine in 1935. It received training in Ein HaHoresh. The other group also consisted of Hashomer Hatzair graduates from Highland Mills, New York. The group formed in 1922 and arrived to Mishmar HaEmek in 1931, where it received agricultural training. Their number was 17 in 1931 and it rose to 30 in 1933. In 1934 they moved to Hadera. In May 1934 both groups united in Hadera under the name \\"Banir-America\\" and worked together in the town. The initial location of the kibbutz was the hill of Jo'ara, about one kilometer from the current location of the kibbutz. It was owned by an Effendi from a family called Salah, residing in Haifa, and was populated by Arab tenant farmers. In 1936, the Jewish National Fund bought the land from the effendi and paid each sharecropper for their evacuation. The funds for the deal were raised by Louis D. Brandeis, a United States Supreme Court Justice lawyer, and a prominent Zionist figure. The Americans donated 70,000 USD for the cause, with 50,000 coming from Brandeis himself. The kibbutz was named in his honor. = Early years = On 5 July 1937 some of the members departed from Mishmar HaEmek, escorted by the Haganah, and arrived to the hill of Jo'ara. The kibbutz was established a part of the Tower and Stockade settlement drive. Built on JNF land with the help of the Keren Hayesod company, it was the first Jewish settlement on the Menashe Heights. Their departure was celebrated in Mishmar HaEmek, from where they brought dismantled structures, equipment for building a wall, and trees for planting. The climb was done on foot, as there was no paved road to the top of the hill. During the following winter the way to the hill was blocked and the members paved a new access road. The members stayed on the hill for one year before moving to the current and final location of the kibbutz. They left the hill of Jo'ara after realizing it was too small. It was handed to the Haganah militia. The construction of, the first permanent building took place in June 1938 and in October the rest of the members from Hadera and Jo'ara joined the kibbutz in its final location. Many members joined the Haganah paramilitary organization and the Notrim Jewish police force. In 1945, Ein HaShofet had a population of 320, all Jews. It was noted that it was the village formerly named Ji'ara (i.e. Jo'ara).Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 13Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 47 Despite a lack of water and hilly difficult reclamation, in 1948, with a population of 450, they \\"were a successful mixed hill farm with orchards, dry cereals, dairy products, sheep herding and chicken farming.\\" During the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine, Ein HaShofet housed a factory for explosives used by the Jewish militia against the British. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the Ein HaShofet villagers helped to defeat Fawzi al-Qawuqji's forces after their April 1948 attack on Mishmar HaEmek.

Two of them were made of Holocaust survivors and the other are youth groups from Israel. Economy The primary component of Ein HaShofet's economy is its industry with three working factories in the kibbutz. According to the 2008 national census, 43% of the workers work in the kibbutz's industrial sector. The secondary component and historically the center of the kibbutz life is agriculture, which employs 20 members of the kibbutz in five different sectors. =Industry= The kibbutz owns three industrial companies through the Ein-Hashofet Industries Group. *Mivrag Cold Forming Technology is a company that produces cold-formed steel components. In the local market, Mivrag supplies agriculture, industrial, high-tech and wholesale companies. In the worldwide market, Mivrag supplies automative companies. With the establishment of the factory in 1952, Mivrag manufactured wooden screws. In the 1960s and 1970s the factory expanded to other products and moved to use metals. In 1987 the factory moved to its current facility. The company began to thrive since the 1990s, expanding its sales to Asia, North America and Europe. *Eltam is a company that produces lighting products. *MAG Ltd. (Mivrag Automative Group) was established in 1999 and produces assemblies for the automotive industry. =Agriculture= *Dairy farming is the first agriculture sector of the kibbutz, beginning already in 1938 with the move to the kibbutz's current location. The dairy has over 200 dairy cows and produces trillions of litres of milk a year. *Cattle farming began in the 1950s in order to exploit lands that couldn't be used for farming. The cattle sector is owned in partnership with kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek (Ein HaShofet owns about 70% of it). The sector struggles to exist due to low profits. In addition to cattle growing, the kibbutz has a successful cattle fattening facility. *Orchards are today used for Avocado growing. The avocado growing began in the mid 1970s. In the early days of the kibbutz, plum trees were the main products. In the 1940s it were vineyards, followed by apples, peaches and pears in the 1950s. *Poultry farming in the kibbutz is centered since 1971 on Chicken fattening. *The field crops sector in the kibbutz is relatively small but profitable. It is centered on wheat and cotton.

It was discovered on 21 September 1901, by Italian astronomer Luigi Carnera at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. It was named after the Italian city of Trieste.  Classification and orbit  Tergeste orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8‚Äì3.3 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,915 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first used observation at Koenigsberg Observatory, 2 days after its official discovery at Heidelberg.  Physical characteristics  Tergeste is a stony S-type asteroid, which belongs to the small group of 41 bodies classified as rare L-subtype in the SMASS taxonomy. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Tergeste measures between 77.3 and 85.6 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.155 and 0.191. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with the revised WISE results and takes an albedo of 0.1914, an absolute magnitude of 7.96 and a diameter of 77.1 kilometers. = Lightcurves = In July 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Tergeste was obtained by several photometrists including Laurent Bernasconi, Reiner Stoss, Petra Korleviƒá and Raoul Behrend. The light-curve gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.23 in magnitude (), superseding a period of hours from the 1980s (). In January 2013, another lightcurve was obtained during a photometric survey by predominantly Polish and Japanese observatories. It gave a similar period of hours with an amplitude of 0.30 magnitude ().

It stars Luke Edwards, Timothy Busfield, and Dennis Farina. The film is director Andrew Scheinman's first and only feature film directorial project. Plot Billy Heywood, the 12-year-old son of widowed Jenny, is a Little League Baseball player. Billy's paternal grandfather, Thomas Heywood, owns the Minnesota Twins. When Thomas dies, Billy learns that he is now the owner of the Twins. Thomas' will specifies that the team executives are to help Billy until he is old enough to run the team by himself. Billy quickly runs afoul of the team manager George O'Farrell. Billy believes O'Farrell is too hard on the players, while O'Farrell despises the idea of working for a kid. After O'Farrell repeatedly insults Billy, Billy fires him. With no other managers willing to work for a kid, and with his grade-school summer break starting in two days, the baseball-savvy Billy decides to name himself the new manager. He reaches out to the Commissioner of Baseball, who approves after consulting with Jenny. The players are very skeptical, but Billy promises that if he does not improve the team's last-place position in the standings within a few weeks, he will resign. The team quickly moves up to division race contention. Unfortunately, not all is going smoothly for Billy, as his friend and star first baseman Lou Collins takes a romantic interest in Jenny. Billy picks up bad habits on the road, and is even ejected from a game and given a one game \\"suspension\\" by his mother for swearing at an umpire because of a call he didn't like. He is troubled when he must release his personal favorite Twins player, Jerry Johnson, who is in the twilight of his career; Billy's awkward handling of the situation ends up making Jerry feel even worse. The pressures of managing the team wear Billy down and consume his free time. Billy's friends do not like how his managerial responsibilities are keeping him away from being with them. Even when he's physically present (as opposed to on the road with the team), he is typically distracted by team business. After Jenny spends her birthday with Lou rather than Billy, Billy uses Lou's minor batting-slump as an excuse to bench him, sending the Twins into a losing skid. Billy later tells his mom that he's tired of being a \\"grown-up\\" and decides to quit as manager after the end of the season, even reinstating Lou to starter on first base. With four games left in the season, the Twins trail the Seattle Mariners by four games in the wild card race. The Twins win their last four while the Mariners lose four straight, forcing a one-game playoff at the Twin's Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome to determine who advances to the postseason. The two teams trade three-run home runs during the course of the game, and extra innings are required. The Mariners eventually take the lead. Down to their final out, and Lou about to go up to bat, he tells Billy that he has asked Jenny to marry him, and that her reply was \\"Ask Billy\\". With a runner on base, Billy says if Lou hits the game-winning homer he will give his blessing, but quickly relents and gives Lou his consent whether or not he hits a homer. Facing Randy Johnson, Lou hits a long fly ball to center field, but Ken Griffey Jr. makes a leaping catch at the wall to rob Lou of a homer and end the game. With their season over, Billy tells the players he is officially stepping down as manager, with pitching coach Mac MacNally taking his place, as well as bringing back Jerry Johnson to be the third base coach and new hitting instructor. The players object to losing Billy, but he reminds the team that he will still be present as the owner, and says that he might come back as manager if junior high doesn't work out. When being informed that none of the fans have left, Billy, along with the rest of the team, returns to the field to receive a standing ovation. Cast Actor Kevin Elster was an active MLB player when the film was shot, while two of his fictional Twins teammates were played by former MLB players Leon Durham and Brad Lesley. John Gordon, who plays the fictional announcer Wally Holland, was the actual radio announcer for the Twins from 1987 through 2011,http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/broadcasters.jsp and was elected into the club's Hall of Fame in 2016.http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/hall-of-famers/ Reception The film has a score of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews. In his three-and-a-half star review, Roger Ebert gave the film praise for being a family movie that doesn't dumb down for its audience or feel predictable.

Natalia Davidova, one of the founders and the head of the Kiev Folk Center, was an Avant-garde artist descended from the ancient Ukrainian Hudim- Levkovichis family (Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev was her cousin and artist Nina Genke-Meller was his sister-in-law). The beginning of the cooperation of Natalia Davidova and Nina Genke-Meller originated not just from their family relations. They both were keen on folk art and were devoted to the idea of implementation of Avant-garde artistic principles into practice of amateur goods. In 1915 Nina Genke became a head and chief artist of Natalia's Davidova Folk Center in Verbovka village. N.Davidova involved Nina Genke in \\"promoting \\" folk thing's production in accordance with the sketchers of famous Avant-garde artists. The members of the Supremus group started to cooperate very actively. Between 1915 and 1916 many Suprematist artists such as Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandra Ekster, Nina Genke-Meller, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Ivan Puni, Ksenia Boguslavskaya, Ivan Kliun and others worked with peasant artisans at the cooperative. In November 1915 N.Davidova, together with A.Ekster and N.Genke, arranged an Exhibition of Modern Decorative Art of the South of Russia in Lamersie Moscow Gallery. There they represented the village ladies' works who studied decorative art in Verbovka and Skoptsi's schools, as well as carpets, pillows, shawls and belts made in accordance with sketches of Popova, Malevich, Davidova, Genke, Ekster, Puni, Kliun, Pribilskaya, Yakulov, Rozanova, Vasilieva, Boguslavskaya and others. The exhibition received broad publicity in the press. In 1917 Davidova and Genke arranged the Second Exhibition of Modern Decorative Art in Moscow in Mikhailava's Saloon.

It was discovered on 21 May 1901, by astronomers Max Wolf and Luigi Carnera at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 16.19 hours and possibly an elongated shape. It was named after the Hanseatic League, a medieval European trade association.  Orbit and classification  Hansa is the namesake and parent body of the stony Hansa family (), a high- inclination family with more than a thousand known members. Hansa and the asteroid 925 Alphonsina are the two largest member of this family. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5‚Äì2.8 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,570 days; semi-major axis of 2.64 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 21¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, the night after its official discovery observation in May 1901.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Hansa is a common, stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurves of Hansa were obtained from photometric observations since the 1990s (). Analysis of the two best-rated lightcurves gave a rotation period of 16.19 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.58 and 0.44 magnitude, respectively (). A high brightness variation typically indicates an elongated shape. A modeled lightcurve using photometric data from large collaboration network was published in 2016. It gave a concurring period of 16.1894 hours, as well as two spin axes at (352.0¬∞, ‚àí18.0¬∞) and (173.0¬∞, ‚àí32.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Hansa measures between 55.94 and 65.67 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.162 and 0.254. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is an albedo of 0.2485 and a diameter of 56.22 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.38.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the Hanseatic League (), a medieval confederation of merchant guilds and market towns in Northern Europe and the Baltic region. On the height of its expansion during the 14th and 15th century, the league included cities that are now located in Germany, Poland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands and Russia. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). The name was proposed by astronomer Heinrich Kreutz in 1906, who was an editor of the journal Astronomische Nachrichten based in the German city of Kiel, which was a member town of the Hanse League.

The group did not take part in electoral politics, instead aiming to educate the working class about the need for a revolution in the style of the Russian and Chinese revolutions. The RCP(OC) was non-collaborationist and opposed all Canadian political parties, including those calling themselves communist. The RCP(OC) considered all current political parties in Canada to be reformist and therefore non-revolutionary by nature. Likewise, they also regarded the bureaucratic leaderships of the unions as collaborating with the bourgeoisie in an effort to undermine the revolutionary struggle of working class. The RCP(OC) worked closely with a communist youth organization, the Red Youth Front, which held its founding meeting in Montreal in November 2005.  Canadian Revolutionary Congress  In November 2006, the RCP(OC) held its first national congress, the Canadian Revolutionary Congress, in Montreal, Quebec.

It is one of the Jain scriptures written in the Sanskrit language. The term Tattvartha is composed of the Sanskrit words tattva which means \\"reality, truth\\" and artha which means \\"nature, meaning\\", together meaning \\"nature of reality\\". The Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative texts in Jainism. It is accepted as authoritative in both its major sub-traditions ‚Äì Digambara and ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara ‚Äì as well as the minor sub-traditions. It is a philosophical text, and its importance in Jainism is comparable with that of the Brahma Sutras and Yoga Sutras of Patanjali in Hinduism. In an aphoristic sutra style of ancient Indian texts, it presents the complete Jainism philosophy in 350 sutras over 10 chapters. The text has attracted numerous commentaries, translations and interpretations since the 5th-century. One of its sutras, Parasparopagraho Jivanam is the motto of Jainism. Its meaning is interpreted as \\"(The function) of souls is to help one another\\", or \\"Souls render service to one another\\". Names Tattvartha Sutra is also known in Jainism as the Moksha-shastra (Scripture describing the path of liberation).  Content  The text written in Sanskrit, begins with an invocation: The first verse of TattvƒÅrths≈´tra, \\"\\" summarizes the Jaina path to liberation. It means that the Ratnatraya (three jewels: right view, right knowledge and right conduct) collectively constitutes the path to liberation or moksha. Its ten chapters are: #Faith and Knowledge #The Category of the Living #The Lower World and the Middle World #The Celestial Beings #The Category of the Non-Living #Influx of Karma #The Five Vows #Bondage of Karma #Stoppage and Shedding of Karma #Liberation Chart showing Samyak Darsana as per Tattvarthasutra The first chapter deals with the process of cognition and details about different types of knowledge. The next three chapters deal with the Jƒ´va (soul), lower worlds, naraka, and celestial abodes, devas. The fifth chapter discusses the Non-soul (ajƒ´va). The next three chapters deal with the karmas and their manifestations and the influx, asrava, good and bad karma, shubha-ashubha karma and the bondage of the karmas. The ninth chapter describes the blocking, samvara and shedding of the karmas, nirjara. The final chapter discusses moksha or the liberation of the soul. =Seven categories of truth= The theology in Tattvartha Sutra presents seven categories of truth in sutra 1.4: #Souls exist (Jeeva) #Non- sentient matter exists (Ajeeva) #Karmic particles exist that inflow to each soul (Aasrava) #Karmic particles bind to the soul {which transmigrate with rebirth} (Bandha) #Karmic particles inflow can be stopped (Samvar) #Karmic particles can fall away from soul (Nirjara) #Complete release of karmic particles leads to liberation from worldly bondage (Moksha) Umaswami categorizes the types of knowledge to be empirical, attained through one's sense of perception. He adds that knowledge is also acquired through literature, clairvoyance, and omniscience. In chapter 2, Umaswati presents sutras on soul. He asserts that soul is distinguished by suppression of deluding karma, or elimination of eight types of karmas, or partial presence of destructive karmas, or arising of eight types of new karmas, or those that are innate to the soul, or a combination of these. In chapter 3 through 6, Umaswati presents sutras for his first three categories of truth. =Ethics= In chapter 7, Umaswati presents the Jaina vows and explains their value in stopping karmic particle inflow to the soul. The vows, with their respective translations by Nathmal Tatia, are :*ahimsa (abstinence from violence) :* anirta (abstinence from falsehood) :* asteya (abstinence from stealing) :* brahmacharya (abstinence from carnality), and :* aparigraha (abstinence from possessiveness). =Karma and rebirths= Umaswati, in chapter 8 of Tattvartha Sutra presents his sutras on how karma affects rebirths. He asserts that accumulated karma in life determines the length of life and realm of rebirth for each soul in each of four states ‚Äì infernal beings, plants and animals, human beings and as gods. Further, states Umaswati, karma also affects the body, the shape, the characteristics as well as the status of the soul within the same species, such as Ucchi (upper) or Nicchi (lower) status. The accumulated and new karma are material particles, states Umaswati, which stick to the soul and these travel with the soul from one life to the next as bondage, where each ripens. Once ripened, the karmic particles fall off, states Umaswati. =Shedding karma and liberation= The chapter 9 of Tattvartha Sutra states how karmic particles can be stopped from attaching to the soul and how these can be shed. Umaswati asserts that gupti (curbing activity), dharma (virtues such as forbearance, modesty, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation), contemplation, endurance in hardship (he lists twenty two hardships including hunger, thirst, cold, heat, nakedness, injury, lack of gain, illness, praise, disrespect), and with good character towards others (he lists five ‚Äì equanimity, reinitiation, non-injury (Ahimsa), slight passion and fair conduct), a soul stops karmic accumulations. External austerities such as fasting, reduced diet and isolated habitation, along with internal austerities such as expiation, reverence, service, renunciation and meditation, according to Umaswati, along with respectful service to teachers and ailing ascetics help shed karma. The state of liberation is presented in Chapter 10 by Umaswati. It is achieved when deluding and obstructive karmas have been destroyed. This leads to the state of quietism and potentiality, and the soul then moves to the end of the universe, states Umaswati. Importance The Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative book on Jainism, and the only text authoritative in both the Digambara and ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara sects, and its importance in Jainism is comparable with that of the Brahma Sutras and Yoga Sutras of Patanjali in Hinduism.Jaini, p. 81  Commentaries and Translations  = Commentaries = The Tattvartha Sutra has the largest number of Jaina bhashyas or commentaries in different Indian languages from the fifth century onward. There are over twenty five commentaries and translations of Tattvartha Sutra. The most famous and oldest commentary on the TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra is SarvƒÅrthasiddhi of ƒÄcƒÅrya Pujyapada (sixth century CE). SarvƒÅrthasiddhi along with Akalanka's c. 780 CE Rajavartika and Vijayananda's Slokavarttika (9th century) form the central texts of Digambara monastic students. =Translations= The text is in sutra form. The word Sutra (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) means \\"string, thread\\".M Winternitz (2010 Reprint), A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 249 The root of the word is siv, that which sews and holds things together.Monier Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Entry for Sutra, page 1241 In the context of Indian literature, Sutra means a distilled collection of syllables and words, any form or manual of \\"aphorism, rule, direction\\" hanging together like threads with which the \\"teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar or any field of knowledge\\" can be woven. The distilled nature of sutra texts leave them open to varying interpretations. The Tattvartha sutra have been variously translated.

It is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley and falls into the Stourbridge (DY8) postcode and address area, being just north of the River Stour. Wordsley is part of the Dudley South Parliamentary constituency and backs onto open countryside with an extensive array of luxury property. History Wordsley lies in the far south of the historic boundaries of Staffordshire and, with neighbouring Amblecote, it is one of several villages just north of the River Stour that forms the historic border with the county of Worcestershire to the south. It formed part of the extensive manor of Kingswinford. A long-distance footpath runs nearby. The path loosely follows the escape of the future Charles II during the English Civil War. He is said to have stopped at a house (which has since been demolished) on the corner of Kinver Street and the main Stourbridge road in Wordsley, during the night following the battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and taken bread and beer for himself and his party of about 60 cavaliers. There were numerous glassworks in Wordsley from 1776 until 1930, making artisan-created cut-glass items such as vases, glasses and objets-d'art. The famous Portland Vase was cut in Wordsley. One of the most famous glass designers was a Wordsley man, William Jabez Muckley. Another was John Northwood, and his son Harry C. Northwood who helped establish glassware in the USA.http://wheeling.weirton.lib.wv.us/people/hallfame/1994nort.htm Yet another who established glassware in the USA was John Northwood's friend, Frederick Carder. One of the most accomplished glasscutters was George Woodall, whose campaign led to the building of the Wordsley School of Art. The 'Red House Glassworks', a 100-foot high glassmaking cone, survives and has recently been restored. Lead-crystal cut-glass from Wordsley's heyday is now rare and collectable. Glassworking continued in the area, albeit at a reduced scale, until the 1990s. Wordsley was the headquarters of the Royal seedsmen, Webbs of Wordsley. Their grounds covered thousands of acres. A Workhouse was opened at Wordsley in 1903 and became fully operational in 1907, becoming a military hospital during World War I (1914‚Äì1918) but became Wordsley Hospital, a civilian hospital, after the end of World War II in 1945. The buildings had been extended during its time as a military hospital but it was further expanded afterwards, the final extension being a state-of-the-art maternity unit that opened in 1988. However, the hospital closed in 2005 with its services being moved to an expanded Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley. Most of the buildings were demolished in 2007 to make way for housing, but parts of the hospital were saved for conversion into housing. These include the chapel, the mortuary and the old workhouse buildings. Places of interest Holy Trinity Church, Wordsley This church is the Holy Trinity Church in Wordsley which was consecrated in 1831, replacing St. Mary. Construction had begun 1828 following the donation of land from the Earl of Dudley. The building was designed by architect Lewis Vulliamy. This replaced the ancient parish church at Kingswinford, which was reopened in 1846, initially as a chapel of ease. Much of the historic fabric of the village has been subject to demolition over the decades. Victorian terraced housing, shops and glassworker cottages - now so valued elsewhere - were replaced en masse by large housing estates built either in the 1960s modernist style or the 1990s Barratt style. Village buildings that were formerly highly notable fine relics of the Victorian and Edwardian era, such as the Wordsley Hospital and the Wordsley School of Art, have recently been demolished or redeveloped. Wordsley Hospital closed in 2005, with its functions being transferred to Russells Hall Hospital. Some of the less significant buildings were demolished in 2007, but most of the older buildings are being refurbished and incorporated into the new housing development. The fine Wordsley School of Art, built in 1899 had fallen into disrepair and was demolished at the end of 2000. The first instructor at the school was Frederick Carder, a glass designer. The building had not been used since the Community Association moved to new premises at The Green in the 1970s. The Broadfield House Glass Museum salvaged two granite plaques which were laid down when the school was completed in 1898 and extended in 1906.Plaques saved - Halesowen News, 4 January 2001 (Retrieved 14 July 2007) The school's site remains empty and overgrown. In 2006, a row of dilapidated shops at the junction of High Street and Brierley Hill Road were cleared, and plans were announced to widen the often congested road system at this point. New apartments were built on the plot and completed in 2008.Retrieved 14 July 2007 There is concern that this, and other major homes schemes in the area, will lead to much increased traffic problems on the High Street. Stuart's Glass Works, another notable building, came under pressure from sales of cheaper imported glass and the business there closed in March 2002. The Stuart's site is earmarked for residential development, which will incorporate some of the historic buildings such as the old flour mill. The glass making centre has now been knocked down, and waiting for a new housing development.A cut above the rest; INTERIORS Jo Ind looks at the Black Country's contribution to glassware in the past century. - Birmingham Post, May 31, 2000 The historic Red House Cone is now preserved as a museum and visitor centre with a craft centre. Transport The A491 road passes through Wordsley, being originally a prehistoric track. Wordsley is served by several bus routes operated by National Express West Midlands, Arriva Midlands, and Diamond West Midlands. National Route 54 of the National Cycle Network passes a mile to the south- east. The navigable Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal passes a mile to the west, and the Stourbridge Canal just to the west, descending in a flight of locks that passes beside the Red House glass cone. The nearest rail station is Stourbridge Town, just under two miles from Wordsley, which is the only station on the Stourbridge Town Branch Line, a branch off the main Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line. Culture and arts Wordsley is noted for having an unusually large number of artistic groups operating in the music, theatre and arts sectors. Wordsley is home to the Dudley Music Centre, a respected local facility for the teaching and performance of music. There are two major theatre groups operating from Wordsley: Wordsley Amateur Dramatics Society, and G.I.S.T. The contemporary poet Gary Bills was born at Wordsley Hospital, and attended Belle Vue Primary School and The Buckpool School, now known as the Wordsley School. Education Wordsley is home to The Wordsley School Business & Enterprise and Music College which was previously known as The Buckpool School. The school is located on Brierley Hill Road next to Buckpool Nature Reserve. It was also next to \\"The Swan\\" pub, which has recently been demolished. Primary schools in the area include; The Brook, Belle Vue, Ashwood Park, Fairhaven and The Glynne. Guiding Wordsley is also home to 5th Wordsley Guide on a Thursday night at the Richardson Hall. Other Clubs Wordsley is also home to a Boys Brigade club, which is held on a Monday night by Jill Fielder & the national treasure, Our Sylvia Liddell alongside Thomas Grosvenor and Jordan Lindsey, it takes place at Richardson Hall. There are also Scout and Brownie groups held weekly and dance classes held at Holy Trinity Church Hall. Wordsley takes great pride in its many great parks.

It was discovered on 9 July 1902, by Italian astronomer Luigi Carnera at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. It was later named for the Italian Veneto region where the city of Venice is located.  Orbit and classification  Venetia orbits the Sun in the middle main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì2.9 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,593 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 10¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins in 1913, at the Collegio Romano Observatory () in Italy, approximately 17 months after its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.  Physical characteristics  On the taxonomic scheme, Venetia is a common, featureless S-type asteroid. More recently, polarimetric observations refined its classification to a rare K-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In March 2014, the so-far best rated rotational lightcurve was obtained by Italian astronomer Andrea Ferrero at the Bigmuskie Observatory () in Mombercelli, Italy. It gave a well-defined rotation period of 13.34 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 magnitude (). The result supersedes previously measured periods of 10.62 to 18 hours. = Spin axis = In two separate studies, groups of German, Russian and Swedish astronomers also modeled Venetias lightcurve from various data sources in 2000 and 2002. They found two spin axes of (259.0¬∞, ‚àí30.0¬∞) and (268.0¬∞, ‚àí24.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤), as well as a concurring rotation period of 13.33170 and 13.34153 hours, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Venetia measures between 59.046 and 66.13 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.228 and 0.328. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.2457 and a diameter of 63.15 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 8.14.  Naming  This minor planet was named for the region of Veneto with its capital and largest city Venice. The region is located in northeast Italy between the Po River and the Alps. Naming was proposed by Italian astronomer Elia Millosevich. Naming citation was first mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 () and amended by Lutz Schmadel for the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names based on a private communication with astronomer Piero Sicoli.

It was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory on 3 September 1902.  Description  With an diameter of more than 100 kilometers, Veritas is the largest member and namesake of the Veritas family, a mid-sized asteroid family of carbonaceous asteroids in the outer main-belt, that formed recently approximately million years ago. David Nesvorn√Ω of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder traced the orbits of these bodies back in time, and calculated that they formed in a collision of a body at least 150 km in diameter with a smaller asteroid. Veritas and Undina would have been the largest fragments of that collision which caused a \\"late Miocene dust shower\\". The family consists of more than a thousand known members including 1086 Nata, 2428 Kamenyar and 2934 Aristophanes. = Late Miocene dust shower = Substantiating Nesvorn√Ω's estimate, Kenneth Farley et al. found evidence in sea-floor sediments of a fourfold increase in the amount of cosmic dust reaching Earth's surface, which began 8.2 million years ago and tapered off over the next million and a half years. This is one of the largest increases in dust deposits of the past 100 million years. The suspected Veritas collision would have been too far from Jupiter for the fragments to have been slung into a collision course with Earth. However, solar radiation would have caused the resulting dust to drift inward to Earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment. Today continuing collisions among Veritas-family asteroids are estimated to send five thousand tons of cosmic dust to Earth each year, 15% of the total.

The population was 1,216 in 2016, an increase of 3.5% from 1,175 in 2011. In 2016, the average age of the population was approximately 43 years old. History =19th century= Markdale was first settled in 1846 and originally called East Glenelg, after a nearby township. In 1864, it was renamed Cornabus after the Scottish hometown, Islay, of the postmaster, Donald MacDuffie (1814‚Äì1892). The post office was established in 1869. In the 1870s, new railways were a vital economic engine for small Ontario towns, as evidenced by nearby Flesherton, which had failed to prosper after the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway decided to bypass it. In 1873, the same railway wanted to make Cornabus a stop on its route from Toronto to Owen Sound if it could find land on which to build a station. A local landowner, Mark Armstrong, sold a parcel of land to the railway on the condition if the new station bore his name. Accordingly, the hamlet of Cornabus became Markdale and saw an immediate increase in business when the railway station opened. Fifteen years later, Markdale was incorporated as a village in 1888. The local newspaper, The Markdale Standard, was first published in 1880 and continued until 2012. =20th century= In 1957, the Regal Films production of the 1958 B film, Wolf Dog, starring Allison Hayes and Jim Davis, was filmed on location in Markdale as well as nearby Holland Township. =21st century= In 2001, Markdale was amalgamated with the townships of Artemesia, Euphrasia and Osprey to form Grey Highlands. On August 20, 2009, an F2 tornado originated in Durham, 20 km southwest of Markdale, with one fatality. It then touched down in Markdale as an F0 and caused local damage. Amenities Markdale is home to several industries including Chapman's Ice Cream and Medike Leather Products. Public services include an Ontario Provincial Police detachment, a fire department, 14-bed Centre Grey Hospital, a public library, an arena and community centre, and a curling and golf club. Events There are several annual festivities, including the Rotary Club's Street Frolic in July, and the Agricultural Society's Markdale Fall Fair in late August.

It is situated on Kossuth Square in the Pest side of the city, on the eastern bank of the Danube. It was designed by Hungarian architect Imre Steindl in neo- Gothic style and opened in 1902. It has been the largest building in Hungary since its completion. History Parliament Building in 1905 Budapest was united from three cities in 1873, namely Buda, √ìbuda, and Pest. Seven years later the Diet resolved to establish a new, representative parliament building, expressing the sovereignty of the nation. The building was planned to face the Danube River. An international competition was held, and Imre Steindl emerged as the victor; the plans of two other competitors were later also realized in the form of the Ethnographic Museum and the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture, both facing the Parliament Building. Construction from the winning plan was started in 1885, and the building was inaugurated on the presumed 1,000th anniversary of the country in 1896. It was not fully completed until 1904. The architect of the building first went blind and then later, died before its completion. About 100,000 people were involved in construction, during which 40 million bricks, half a million precious stones and of gold were used. Since World War II the legislature became unicameral, and today the government uses only a small portion of the building. During the People's Republic of Hungary a red star perched on the top of the dome, but it was removed in 1990 after the fall of communism. M√°ty√°s Sz≈±r√∂s declared the Hungarian Republic from the balcony facing Kossuth Lajos Square on 23 October 1989. Features Court yard side of the Budapest Parliament Building at night. The Parliament Building is built in the Gothic Revival style; it has a symmetrical fa√ßade and a central dome. The dome is Renaissance Revival architecture. The parliament is also largely symmetrical from the inside, with two identical parliament halls on the opposing sides of the building. One of the two halls is still in use today for sessions of the Hungarian National Assembly, the other for ceremonies, conferences, and guided tours. It is long and wide. Its interior includes 10 courtyards, 13 passengers and freight elevators, 27 gates, 29 staircases and 691 rooms (which includes more than 200 offices). With its height of , it is one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest, along with Saint Stephen's Basilica. The number 96 refers to the nation's millennium, 1896, and the conquest of the later Kingdom of Hungary in 896. It is free to enter before 8 am. The main fa√ßade overlooks the River Danube, but the official main entrance is from the square on the east side of the building. Inside and outside, there are altogether 242 sculptures on the walls. The fa√ßade displays statues of Hungarian rulers, Transylvanian leaders and famous military figures. The coats of arms of kings and dukes are depicted over the windows. The eastern staircase is flanked by two lions. When entering the Parliament, visitors can walk up great ornamental stairs, see frescoes on the ceiling, and pass by the bust of the architect, Imre Steindl, in a wall niche. Other statues include those of √Årp√°d, Stephen I and John Hunyadi. The building features stained glass and glass mosaics by Miksa R√≥th. One of the famous parts of the building is the hexadecagonal (sixteen-sided) central hall, with huge chambers adjoining it: the Lower House and the Upper House. The modern National Assembly is unicameral and meets in the Lower House, while the Upper House is used as a conference and meeting room. The Holy Crown of Hungary, which is also depicted in the coat of arms of Hungary, has been displayed in the central hall since 2000. Due to its extensive surface and its detailed handiwork, the building is almost always under renovation. Accessibility and neighbourhood The Parliament is accessible with Line 2 of the Budapest Metro and with tram line 2, from the Kossuth Lajos Square station. At the east front of the building is a memorial to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, as well as the imposing Kossuth Memorial and the equestrian statue of Francis II R√°k√≥czi. A seated statue of Attila J√≥zsef as described in his poem By the Danube occupies a site on the south lawn. Martyrs' Square (V√©rtan√∫k tere) is immediately adjacent to Kossuth Square, with a statue of Imre Nagy. Postage stamps The building features on more than 50 postage stamps issued by Hungary during 1917‚Äì1921. Some of them are: In 1917, 1919, 15 April 1920, and 1921.

The event was a competition of chili cooking. Winners of the contest automatically qualified for the World Championship Chili Cookoff at Terlingua, Texas. The rules were few and simple, being no more than: # All chili must be made from scratch at the site of the contest. # Women are barred from entering the contest as chefs.

While working on Ain't But the One Way, Clinton and Funkadelic quarreled with and eventually left Warner Bros. Records, and Sly Stone went into self-seclusion and could not be found. Producer Stewart Levine was assigned to take control of the project, and do what he could to complete an album.

Sprouse has worked for multiple publishers and has won two Eisner Awards for his work on Tom Strong, a series he created with writer Alan Moore. Biography Chris Sprouse was born in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the age of 3 he moved with his family to New Delhi, India where he first discovered comics as he was unable to play outside due to the dangerous amount of snakes in the house yard. When he was 6, his family returned to the United States to Dale City, Virginia, where he continued to read and draw comics. Before his debut in comics, Sprouse drew a comic strip entitled \\"Ber-Mander\\", for the school newspaper (The Hyphen), while attending Gar-Field Senior High School in Woodbridge. After graduating in 1984, Sprouse attended James Madison University where he studied graphic design. Sprouse launched his career in mainstream comics in 1989, his first credited work being a Chemical King story in Secret Origins vol. 2 #47 (Feb. 1990). His next assignments were a Two-Face story for Batman Annual #14 (1990) and the Hammerlocke limited series. He drew insert posters for the War of the Gods limited series in 1991. Following that, Sprouse drew the Legionnaires series featuring teenaged versions of the Legion of Super-Heroes. He later illustrated a number of one-shots and fill-in issues before illustrating a Star Wars mini-series, Splinter of the Mind's Eye, for Dark Horse Comics. He then worked for Extreme Studios as the regular penciller of New Men, and in 1997‚Äì1998, Sprouse drew several issues of Supreme, scripted by Alan Moore for the same publisher. After Supreme ended, he and Moore created Tom Strong for America's Best Comics, for which Sprouse won two Eisner Awards in 2000, for Best Single Issue and Best Serialized Story. Sprouse was the penciller and co-creator on the 2004 Ocean mini-series, written by Warren Ellis and published by DC Comics. In 2007, Ocean was optioned for film. In 2006, he began pencilling Wildstorm's Midnighter ongoing series, a spin-off of The Authority. He was the artist on the first issue of Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne with Grant Morrison as writer. In 2011, Sprouse worked with writer Peter Hogan on the Tom Strong and the Planet of Peril limited series.

Situated approximately 3 miles west of Anstruther, the small community, whose inhabitants used to make their living mainly from fishing, is now a tourist destination situated on the Fife Coastal Path. The former burgh rests on a hill overlooking the Firth of Forth, with views to North Berwick, the Bass Rock and the Isle of May. St Monans contains many historical buildings, including the now defunct windmill (which can be visited) that once powered a salt panning industry, and a 14th-century church that sits on the rocks above the water on the western side. Approximately mile west of St Monans are the remains of Newark Castle, a 16th-century manor that has since fallen to ruin through cliff erosion and disrepair. In 2002, with the permission of Historic Scotland, an unsuccessful attempt to restore the castle was made. The civil parish has a population of 1,357 in 2011.Census of Scotland 2011, Table KS101SC ‚Äì Usually Resident Population, publ. by National Records of Scotland. Web site http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ retrieved March 2016. See ‚ÄúStandard Outputs‚Äù, Table KS101SC, Area type: Civil Parish 1930 Parish church St Monans Church dates from 1369Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae by Hew Scott and is situated in an isolated position to the west of the village on the very edge of the sea. It is perched on a low rock, over a small valley with a burn. As seen from most directions it has the sea as a backdrop. The original graveyard surrounds the church and a more modern cemetery stands further westwards on the upper slopes of the little hill. This contains the local war memorial. Standing at the extreme west end of this the ruin of an earlier church can be viewed across fields, again perched on the sea edge. It is often said that St Monans is the church nearest the sea in the whole of Scotland, and this may well be the case, being only around 20 m from the edge. The church, one of the finest remaining from the Middle Ages in Scotland, was built by King David II Bruce (1329‚Äì71), initially for a small house of Dominican friars. It later became the Church of Scotland parish church. Though the church may never have been finished (it has a choir and transepts, with a short spire over the crossing, but lacks a nave), it has many features of architectural interest, notably the fine stone vaulting in the choir and the plain but handsome sedilia. White-washed throughout internally, the church is particularly light and attractive among ancient Scottish churches. The church was greatly restored in 1899 by the Glasgow architect, Peter MacGregor Chalmers. The church hall was added in 1913 to a design by Sir Robert Lorimer.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer Major restoration to the windows and masonry was completed in March 2007. The church is open to visitors daily from April to October. The church and churchyard feature in the funeral scene in the film The Railway Man. St. Monans Gospel Hall The Hall was built in 1970 and is a modern building, harled with a slate roof, situated in a raised location facing broadly west over Hope Park on the northern edge of St. Monans. Prior to its construction, it was not uncommon for fishermen from St Monans to cycle to St Andrews to attend meetings at the Gospel Hall there. Shops, hotels, caf√©s and businesses St Monans has a fish merchants and a fish-smokehouse. Restaurants and cafes are common in the village, as are many privately owned holiday homes. There is also a caravan park which attracts many visitors, a tradition that has continued from the days of the railway line. In the industrial estate at the entrance to St Monans are the remains of the old railway station, a relic of the old East Neuk Rail Line, part of the Fife Coast Railway which was shut down in the 1960s after the Beeching cuts. All that remains is the south platform which is overgrown with grass. Nearby is the station master's house, now a private residence, which stands out from the newer buildings surrounding it. History The village takes its name from St Monance, who was killed by invading Danes in about 875. St Adrian was killed on the Isle of May in the same raid, and 6,000 Fife Christians are said to have died.Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 490-94 Like other small East Neuk towns, St Monans is rich in vernacular fisher and merchant houses of the 17th to early 19th centuries, with characteristic old Scots features, e.g. forestairs, crow-stepped gables, datestones, pantiled roofs etc. The tradition of shipbuilding has now ceased. For over 200 years the boat builder J W Miller & Sons Ltd produced fifie fishing boats, yachts and motor launches in the village. Typical buildings in East Neuk, as seen in St. Monans The author Christopher Rush grew up in the village. His autobiography Hellfire and Herring describes the community as seen by a small boy in the 1940s, 1950s and earlier, and as recounted by his grandfather and other relatives.

It is located in the Eastern Crimean Peninsula, approximately 25 km (15 mi.) west of Theodosia. Population:  Names  During the late 13th century, the town was known as either Solkhat (Solkhad, Solghad, ) or as Qrƒ±m ( ). Neither name is unattested prior to the 13th century, but on the authority of al-Qalqashandi, Solkhat is the older of the two, dating to the period prior to the Mongol conquest in mid-1238. Both names coexisted during the 14th century, but the name Qƒ±rƒ±m came to displace Solkhat by the early 15th. The origin of either name is uncertain.Perhaps a Turkified form of the Italian name Solcati ( ‚Äì furrow, ditch). An alternative proposal derives it from the name of an Armenian monastic complex in Staryi Krym, built in 1338 and known in Armenian as \\"Surb Khach,\\" or Holy Cross. Maksoudian, Krikor (1997). \\"Armenian Communities in Eastern Europe\\" in The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century. Richard Hovannisian (ed.) New York: Palgrave Macmillan. p. 57. . Some consider Solkhat to be related to the Greek Colchis. Before the Mongol period, mention is made in Greek hagiography of the residence of the Khazar governor of the eastern part of the peninsula, as a fortress named Phoulla or Phoullai (Œ¶Œø·ø¶ŒªŒªŒ±Œπ, although other sources identify this place with Chufut-Kale)Vasilev A. A., \\"The Goths in the Crimea,\\" Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1936, p. 98 along with Sugdaia (Sudak); it is likely that the site of this fortress corresponds to the site of Solghat.E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Volume 4, pp. 1084f. The name Qirim may continue the old name Cimmerium (after the Cimmerians). The Strait of Kerch was known as Bosporus Cimmerius in the Roman era (as reported by Ptolemy, Polybius, and Strabo), after the city of Cimmerium which stood nearby. The promontory or peninsula on which it stood was known as Promontorium Cimmerium (ŒöŒπŒºŒºŒ≠œÅŒπŒøŒΩ ·ºÑŒ∫œÅŒøŒΩ). The 13th-century toponym Qrim is likely explained as a corruption of the name Cimmerium.Cimmerium. Encyclopedia Britannica 4th edition (1810). There are however alternative suggestions, such as derivation from the Greek Cremnoi (ŒöœÅŒ∑ŒºŒΩŒøŒØ, in post-classical Koin√© Greek pronunciation, Crimni, i.e., \\"the Cliffs\\", referenced by Herodotus 4.20.1 and 4.110.2) or from a Mongolian appellation.Adrian Room, Placenames of the World, 2003, p. 96. . The name \\"Crimea\\" (for the Crimean Khanate, and later also for the peninsula itself) is derived from the name of the city. It became adopted as an alternative term for what used to be known as Tauris or Tauric Peninsula in western languages from the 17th century.Edward Gibbon, The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 10 (1788), p. 211: \\"The modern reader must not confound this old Cherson of the Tauric or Crimean peninsula with a new city of the same name\\". Since the annexation of Crimea by Catherine II of Russia in 1783, the town has been known by the Russian name Staryi Krym (Russian staryi meaning \\"old\\", rendered in Crimean Tatar as eski; also transliterated as Staroi Krim and variants).\\"North-west of Kaffa and east of Karasu bazar is Eski or Staroi Krim (i.e., Old Krim), the Cimmerium of the Greeks, which gave its name to the peninsula.\\" Henry H. Howorth, History of the Mongols, from the 9th to the 19th century, part 2: The so-called Tartars of Russia and Central Asia (1880) p. 625 Although officially the town was renamed Levkopol after the ancient Greek name of Leukopolis (White City), this never gained popularity, perhaps because the town already styled a name from antiquity.  History  The town was probably the site of an earlier Khazar fortress before the Mongol conquest of the Crimea in mid-1238. The Mongols under Batu Khan fortified the town and thereafter it became a capital of the Crimean Yurt (Crimean province of the Golden Horde) and a home for the Emir of Crimea. Before the 1270s, Qrim had been a village surrounding a fort at best, but by the early 14th century it had grown into a prosperous city. Kaykaus II was given Qrim as a fief in c. 1265. Tatar coins were struck in Qrim from 1287/8 (AH 686) and in the same year, an Egyptian architect was sent there to build a mosque to be named after the Egyptian sultan. From that period remain the Ozbek Han Mosque, built in 1314 by Uzbeg Khan, and the ruins of a madrassa built in 1332. The town prospered during the 14th century, but it was completely destroyed during the civil unrest under Mengli Girai in the later 15th century. Qrim seems to have retained its position as capital of the newly established Crimean Khanate for some years, as coins struck here are dated to as late as 1517 (AH 923), after which point in 1532 the capital of the Ottoman vassal state was moved to Bakhchisaray, and the city declined into relative obscurity. After the Russian conquest of the Crimean Khanate in the 1770s, the city of Staryi Krym was given the Greek name of Leukopolis (Lewkopol), but this name never entered common usage. Staryi Krym was the city where the famous Russian writer Alexander Grin lived and died, and now has a museum dedicated to him. The city is home to an important cardiac sanatorium, formerly run by notable heart surgeon Nikolai Amosov.  Ecclesiastical history  As Phulli, it was one of the bishoprics in the Roman client-state, later province, of the Bosporan Kingdom, where no imperial metropolis was established, and it faded under heathen rule. The diocese was nominally restored in 1929, as a Latin Catholic titular archbishopric (Curiate Italian name Fulli).

The route currently exists in two segments, a southern segment and a northern segment. The southern segment runs from U.S. Route 30 (US 30) near Malvern north to Interstate 78 (I-78)/PA 309 near Allentown. The northern segment runs from I-81 in Ashley north to the New York-Pennsylvania border near Brookdale, where the route becomes New York State Route 7 (NY 7). The route was continuous until May 9, 1966, when PA 29 was split into the two segments that exist today. The southernmost of PA 29's northern segment is a limited-access highway known as the South Cross Valley Expressway. Route description =Southern section= Chester County PA 29 northbound at US 202 interchange in East Whiteland Township The southern section of PA 29 begins at an intersection with US 30 near the borough of Malvern in East Whiteland Township, Chester County, heading north on six-lane divided South Morehall Road. The road passes businesses and office parks, curving northwest and crossing the Chester Valley Trail before coming to an interchange with the US 202 freeway. The route passes to the west of the Penn State Great Valley university campus at the Swedesford Road intersection and becomes North Morehall Road, narrowing to four lanes and heading to the west of the Great Valley Corporate Center. PA 29 runs through wooded areas, crossing Valley Creek, before curving north and passing through more of the Great Valley Corporate Center. The road runs between a quarry to the west and a lake to the east before it comes to an E-ZPass-only ramp providing access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76). Past here, the route becomes undivided passes near more commercial development, crossing into Charlestown Township and curving northwest. The road passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike and crosses an abandoned railroad line before it comes to the community of Devault. At this point, PA 29 turns north onto two-lane undivided State Road and runs through wooded areas with the abandoned railroad parallel to the east. The road curves northwest and passes to the west of a quarry before continuing through forests. The route turns north and passes through the community of Aldham before it makes a curve to the northeast and crosses the Pickering Creek. PA 29 passes under the abandoned railroad line and enters Schuylkill Township, heading through a mix of woods and fields with some homes parallel to the creek. The road turns east and then northeast, heading away from the Pickering Creek and continuing into suburban residential development. The route becomes the border between the borough of Phoenixville to the northwest and Schuylkill Township to the southeast before fully entering Phoenixville as Main Street, passing homes. PA 29 heads to the east of Phoenixville Hospital before it comes to an intersection with PA 23, at which point Main Street splits to the north and PA 29 continues northeast along Manavon Street. The route continues through residential areas, turning north onto Starr Street. PA 29 heads north into the commercial downtown of Phoenixville, where it turns east onto Bridge Street. The route continues east and is joined by the Schuylkill River Trail from the west, passing under Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line before it comes to the Mont Clare Bridge over the Schuylkill River. Montgomery County PA 29 northbound in Upper Providence Township Upon crossing the Schuylkill River, PA 29 enters Upper Providence Township in Montgomery County and heads northeast as Phoenixville- Collegeville Road, crossing the Schuylkill River Trail, which splits to the east, and heading into the community of Mont Clare. The road runs past a mix of homes and businesses, passing under an abandoned railroad line. The route continues through residential areas before heading into a mix of fields and woods with some homes. PA 29 passes southeast of a golf course and becomes South Collegeville Road, passing near business parks and widening to four lanes. The road becomes a divided highway and comes to an interchange with the US 422 freeway. Past this interchange, the route becomes a six-lane divided highway and runs between the Providence Town Center to the northwest and office parks to the southeast. PA 29 narrows to a two-lane undivided road and passes to the southeast of residential development, heading through the community of Yerkes. The road runs through wooded areas before it heads near businesses and enters the borough of Collegeville, where it gains a second northbound lane and becomes 2nd Avenue. The route curves east and crosses the Perkiomen Trail before heading past a shopping center to the north and homes to the south. The road narrows to two lanes and turns north, heading past more businesses and widening to a four-lane divided highway as it comes to an intersection with East Main Street. Here, PA 29 turns east on two-lane undivided Main Street for a block before it heads north onto two-lane 1st Avenue, running along the west bank of the Perkiomen Creek.

History =Original route= PA 29 was created and first signed in 1928. During this time, construction began on the segment between Tunkhannock north to Springville. A year later, the stretch between Tunkhannock and Lemon, midway Tunkhannock and Springville, opened to traffic. Lemon to Springville opened the following year, in 1930. In 1934, work started on the section between US 6 in Tunkhannock and Franklin Forks, located midway between Montrose and the state border. The construction was complete by the following year. In 1936, two major sections of the route, stretching between Evans Falls to Rosengrants, near Tunkhannock, and from Franklin Forks to the state line, were paved. A subsequent project united PA 29 into a single route, completing the road from Hazleton to Tunkhannock. PA 29 and PA 113 switched alignments between Phoenixville and Rahns in 1937, with PA 29 now following its present alignment between those two places. Two years later, the section from Rosengrants to Tunkhannock was paved. In 1940, the section between Bowmans Creek and Evans Falls was paved. The first realignment of the route came in 1946 when PA 29 was routed to its current position between West Nanticoke and Silkworth, shifting the route from Cragle Hill Road and Swamp Road to U.S. Route 11 from Shickshinny to West Nanticoke. This routing replaced Pennsylvania Route 139. The route was split on May 9, 1966 by eliminating the section between US 309 in Allentown and US 11 in West Nanticoke, removing a number of overlaps that linked the two segments. The former alignment of PA 29 became solely US 309 (now PA 309) between Allentown and Schnecksville, newly- designated PA 873 between Schnecksville and Lehigh Gap, newly-designated PA 248 between Lehigh Gap and Weissport, solely US 209 between Weissport and Nesquehoning, an extension of PA 93 between Nesquehoning and Nescopeck, an extension of PA 239 between Nescopeck and Shickshinny, and solely US 11 between Shickshinny and West Nanticoke. =Post-split= In 1969, construction began on the South Cross Valley Expressway between Sugar Notch and the Nanticoke interchange. The expressway was extended to Interstate 81 in 1971 and opened in 1972. Prior to construction of the US 202 expressway in 1970, PA 29 travelled entirely on Phoenixville Pike between Phoenixville and West Chester. PA 29 entered West Chester on Goshen Road and Marshall Street ending at PA 100 in town. When the US 202 expressway was built, PA 29 was rerouted onto Morehall Road at Devault and ran south to junction US 202 and then end at US 30. There are still today numerous road signs on Phoenixville Pike between Frazer and West Chester that label the road as PA 29. In 1978, PA 29 was re- signed to the northern segment of the route after 12 years of not having a designation. The southern terminus was moved from West Nanticoke to the current end at I-81 exit 164 in Ashley. There are future plans to extend the South Cross Valley Expressway in 2009. In 2009, a roundabout was constructed at the intersection of PA 29 and PA 73 in Lower Frederick Township; crashes decreased at this junction after the roundabout opened. On December 11, 2012, an E-ZPass only interchange opened with the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Major intersections PA 29 Truck =Montgomery County= Pennsylvania Route 29 Truck signs are used to direct motorists from Egypt Road at the US 422 interchange to PA 29 in Upper Providence Township in Montgomery County. Trucks are not allowed to make the sharp right turn from westbound Egypt Road to northbound PA 29 and must use Black Rock Road to access PA 29 north. Trucks heading to southbound PA 29 may access it from Egypt Road. =Lehigh County= Pennsylvania Route 29 Truck is a truck route around a weight-restricted bridge over Norfolk Southern's Reading Line in Upper Milford Township in Lehigh County, on which trucks over 30 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows Buckeye Road and Chestnut Street (running concurrent with PA 100 Truck), PA 100, Weilers Road, Hamilton Boulevard, and Lower Macungie Road. It was signed in 2013.

Since retiring as a player he has worked as a goalkeeping coach. Playing career =South America= Crawley first travelled to South America on a NSW Schoolboys tour in 1990. This eventually led to his signing with Chilean club Colo-Colo. Crawley spent the next five years at Colo-Colo, including some loan spells to clubs including Lota Schwager and Magallanes. Crawley acted as a liaison officer when the Australian national team stayed in Chile in preparation for the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification play-off against Argentina in November 1993. He made his first team debut for Colo-Colo in a draw against Atacama in the last game of the 1994 Primera Divisi√≥n of Chile. Crawley remained second choice at Colo- Colo, behind Chilean international goalkeeper Marcelo Ram√≠rez, and in 1995 was forced to decide between adopting Chilean citizenship or retaining his Australian passport. =Return to New South Wales= Crawley returned to Australia in 1995. He spent the next decade moving between several clubs, largely in the New South Wales state league, with the exception of a brief spell in the National Soccer League with Sydney United. Crawley was signed by Central Coast Mariners in December 2004 ahead of the inaugural A-League season. By the start of the season, Crawley had shown good form and established himself as the Mariners first-choice 'keeper. However, a hip injury in the early rounds of the season saw Crawley miss most of the season, his place in the side taken by young goalkeeper Danny Vukovic, who Crawley had coached for several years. Coaching career Before his retirement as a player, Crawley had taken up a role as goalkeeping coach at the Mariners, and continued in that role for over a decade, also taking on other coaching duties including video analysis. His role in the development of Mariners goalkeepers Danny Vukovic and Mathew Ryan from young ages to becoming established professionals was particularly notable. Crawley took up a position with the Australia under-23s in 2015, in the lead-up to the 2016 AFC U-23 Championship. In 2015, Crawley joined Sydney FC as their goalkeeping coach, following former Mariners head coach Graham Arnold. Over his years of coaching, he takes heavy influence off the goalkeeping styles of South America, many of which he picked up himself during his time at Colo-Colo. He states that he is often preached for his coaching in one-on-one situations and most notably the side volley, which helped develop his former Mariners goalkeepers.https://www.facebook.com/Socceroos/videos/10155508547122028/ Honours =Club= ;Central Coast Mariners *A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup: 2005 See also * List of Central Coast Mariners FC players References External links *OzFootball Archives Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Sportsmen from New South Wales Category:Australian expatriate soccer players Category:A-League players Category:National Soccer League (Australia) players Category:Blacktown City FC players Category:Central Coast Mariners FC players Category:Expatriate footballers in Chile Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Colo- Colo footballers Category:Sydney United 58 FC players Category:Juventud Puente Alto footballers Category:Central Coast Mariners FC non-playing staff Category:Soccer players from Sydney Category:Australian soccer players Category:Association football goalkeeping coaches ","title":"John Crawley (soccer)"},{"id":"3032251","text":"I-176 may refer to: * Interstate 176 or I-176, a road in the United States * , a vessel of the Imperial Japanese Navy active in World War II ","title":"I176"},{"id":"3032257","text":"Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar. Portrait by Antonio Herrera Toro (1878) Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar (10 February 1827 ‚Äì 17 December 1902) was a Venezuelan painter, best known for his portraits and historical scenes.  Biography  Tovar was born and died in Caracas. His father, Antonio Maria Tovar (1791‚Äì1860), was a former official of the Spanish government who had retired after receiving a serious bullet wound during the War of Independence. His mother, Damiana Tovar Liendo (c.1805‚Äì1844), was from Caracas. The family had been living in exile in Puerto Rico, but returned to Venezuela immediately before Tovar's birth.Biography @ Wikihistoria del Arte Venezolano. He received his first lessons from Celestino Mart√≠nez who, at the age of nineteen, had just become an instructor at the \\"Academia de Dibujo\\" (Drawing Academy). Later, Tovar studied at the Academy itself with Antonio Jos√© Carranza and at the \\"Colegio de La Paz\\" with Carmelo Fern√°ndez. In 1844, he joined with Fern√°ndez and two other artists to acquire a lithography workshop owned by German emigrants.Brief biography @ MCN Biograf√≠as. Study for the Signing of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence In 1850, he travelled to Spain and enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. There, he studied with Jos√© de Madrazo and his son, Federico de Madrazo, among others.Brief biography @ Efem√©rides Venezolanos. In 1851, he opened a shop called \\"Fotograf√≠a Art√≠stica de Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar\\", becoming one of his country's pioneer photographers. In 1852, he moved to Paris and found a position in the workshop of L√©on Cogniet. Three years later, he returned to Venezuela, but stayed for only a year before going back to Paris to copy paintings by the major artists, with a view towards using them to establish a national museum in Caracas. His proposal was accepted, but a lack of funds kept it from being realized. He continued to focus on portraits, however, and participated in several exhibitions, including the International Exposition (1867) in Paris. Two years later, he was appointed Director of the \\"Academia de Bellas Artes\\" in Caracas. In 1872, he exhibited at the \\"Primera Exposici√≥n Anual de Bellas Artes Venezolanas\\", organized by the explorers James Mudie Spence (1836‚Äì1878)Biography of Spence @ Pioneros en Venezuela. and Anton Goering (who was also a painter). In 1873, he received what would be his largest commission; painting 30 portraits of heroes from the War of Independence and other public figures for the \\"Sal√≥n El√≠ptico\\" at the Palacio Federal Legislativo, a project that would occupy him for two years. In 1881, he received another commission from President Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco; a large canvas depicting the signing of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, also for the \\"Sal√≥n El√≠ptico\\". The work was presented at the \\"Exposici√≥n Nacional de Venezuela\\" in 1883 and was awarded a gold medal. This resulted in further commissions to portray the battles of Carabobo, Boyac√°, Jun√≠n and Ayacucho. After researching and sketching the battle sites, he set up a workshop in Paris, which he maintained from 1887 to the late 1890s, commuting between there and Caracas and doing more portraits as well as the battle scenes. He had finished only three of the battles when he died in 1902. The Battle of Ayucucho was completed by Antonio Herrera Toro, using Tovar's studies.

It was discovered by American astronomer Solon Bailey at Harvard's Boyden Station in Arequipa, Peru, on 30 June 1902. It was later named after Cora, a figure in Inca mythology.  Classification and orbit  Cora orbits the Sun in the middle main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì3.3 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,640 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins 4 years after its discovery with the first used observation made at Heidelberg in 1906.  Physical characteristics  = Spectral type = On the Tholen taxonomic scheme, as well as by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Cora is classified as a metallic M-type asteroid. Mineralogic observations in the near-infrared with the NASA IRTF telescope using its SpeX spectrograph, showed that its surface is that of an X-type asteroid, with absorption features indicating the presence of pyroxene minerals. In 2004, the body's spectrum was also obtained in the SMASSII survey at the U.S. MDM Observatory, Kitt Peak, Arizona. = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurves of Cora were obtained for this asteroid by astronomers Maria A. Barucci, David Higgins, Axel Martin, and the Palomar Transient Factory. With one exception, they all gave a rotation period close to 7.59 hours. Among these, David Higgins observation made in September 2010, at the Hunters Hill Observatory () in Ngunnawal, Australia ‚Äì gave the best rated lightcurve with a period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.20 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's WISE telescope with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Coras surface has a high albedo between 0.239 and 0.341. Combined with their respective absolute magnitudes, this results in a diameter estimate of 27.2 to 35.0 kilometers. In contrast, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives a much lower albedo of 0.19 and a diameter of 29.1 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 10.1.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Cora, a figure in Inca mythology ().

The epicenter was approximately to the east of the extremely destructive 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake that happened a few months earlier. Both strike-slip earthquakes were caused by movement on the North Anatolian Fault. Tectonic setting The western and central parts of Turkey lie on the eastern part of the Anatolian Plate, which is currently being forced to the west by the continuing northward movement of the Arabian Plate. In northern Turkey, this westward motion is taken up by a major zone of dextral (right-lateral) strike-slip, the North Anatolian Fault. The 1999 D√ºzce event is the most recent in a sequence of large earthquakes that have affected the North Anatolian Fault, starting towards the eastern end with the 1939 Erzincan earthquake, then propagating towards the west with events in 1942, 1943, 1944, 1951, 1957, 1967 and finally the 1999 ƒ∞zmit event. At its western end the North Anatolian Fault splits into two main segments, with the northern of these giving rise to the 1999 earthquakes. Earthquake The earthquake had an estimated magnitude in the range 7.1‚Äì7.2 on the moment magnitude scale. The International Seismological Centre gives a magnitude of 7.16¬±0.1 for this event in their catalogue. The maximum measured intensity was IX at a seismometer about 4 km from the epicentre, with a peak ground acceleration of 147.80%g and a peak ground velocity of 113.02 cm/sec. =Ground rupture= A surface rupture of 40 km was identified in the field along the D√ºzce Fault, part of the northern splay of the North Anatolian Fault. This was extended by an additional 15 km at the eastern end using SPOT imagery. The maximum identified lateral displacement was 5 m, with an average displacement of 3 m. At the western end of the fault, there was a maximum 3.5 m of vertical displacement. =Rupture propagation= Analysis of seismometer records suggests that the rupture propagated towards the east faster than the S-wave velocity (supershear) and to the west slower than the S-wave velocity. Supershear rupture propagation is characteristic of strike-slip earthquakes, particularly on fault segments that are relatively simple and planar in geometry. Damage D√ºzce and surrounding areas had already been quite badly affected by the ƒ∞zmit earthquake a few months earlier, so that many buildings were already in a weakened state when the November earthquake struck. The number of fatalities in D√ºzce is recorded as 478, with an additional 313 in the town of Kayna≈ülƒ± and 48 in the city of Bolu. A significant number of deaths were attributed to the presence of traditional heaters causing fires and related smoke effects, particularly in Kayna≈ülƒ±. Relief efforts Following criticism of their response to the ƒ∞zmit earthquake, the Turkish government reacted quickly to the November earthquake, with rapid deployment of military personnel, police and medical teams to the area. Field hospitals were provided by teams from Russia, Japan, Egypt and Israel. Search and rescue teams were sent from many countries including Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Israel, United Kingdom, United States, Greece, Germany, Russia, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Algeria, Sweden and Switzerland. An estimated 2,000 rescuers were present, including 150 search dogs. Many of those made homeless by the earthquake were temporarily placed in encampments, but this was problematic as the weather was generally wet and temperatures at night were at or near freezing and many of the tents were not \\"winterized\\". A year after the earthquake, about 7,500 people were still living in tents with about 30,000 accommodated in prefabricated houses.

It was discovered on 23 June 1903, by astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after the Italian city of Turin. It is the 4th-largest Mars-crossing asteroid.  Orbit and classification  Taurinensis is a Mars-crossing asteroid, a dynamically unstable group between the main belt and the near- Earth populations, crossing the orbit of Mars at 1.666 AU. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.6‚Äì2.7 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,183 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 9¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its identification as at Heidelberg in April 1909, almost 6 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  Taurinensis is a common, stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen and SMASS classification. = Rotation period = In 1982, the asteroid was observed using photometry from the La Silla Observatory to generate a composite light curve. The resulting data showed a rotation period of 0.2326 days (5.58 h) with a brightness variation of 0.2 in magnitude. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Taurinensis measures between 18.70 and 23.09 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1772 and 0.270. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1772 and a diameter of 23.09 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.72. With a mean-diameter of 20 kilometers, Taurinensis is the 4th-largest Mars-crossing asteroids, just behind 132 Aethra (43 km), 323 Brucia (36 km) and 2204 Lyyli (25 km), and larger than 1508 Kemi (17 km), 1474 Beira (15 km) and 1310 Villigera (14 km).

He was not only a fast horse, but also showed great staying ability. He was a brown horse bred in England by Mr. Halford. Leamington was by the good racehorse and sire Faugh-a-Ballagh (by Sir Hercules), his dam was an unnamed mare bred by the Marquis of Westminster and foaled in 1841 by Pantaloon.Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software Racing record =At two years= Halford began racing him at age two, and then sold him to a Mr. Higgins. Leamington won the Woodcote Stakes at Warwick and the Chesterfield Stakes, before being retired for the year. =At three years= As a three-year-old, it was planned to run the colt in The Derby, but he contracted strangles, and this affected his whole three-year-old season. However, his owners and trainers appeared to have planned his losses to help keep his handicap weight down. After losing four small races carrying little weight, he won the Wolverhampton, before his losing several more. He was then \\"allowed\\" to win the Stewards' Cup carrying only 98 lb (44 kg). =At four years= His four-year-old career began with the 2.25 mile Chester Cup. Leamington only carried 93 lb (42 kg), due to his poor reputation gained as a three-year-old, and he easily won the race. The colt then came fourth at the Ascot Gold Cup. He went on to the Goodwood Stakes, carrying only 118 lb (53.5 kg) with odds of 100 to 3, and easily won the race by a length. His owners won quite a bit of money from wagering on him that day, after their longshot with 100 to 3 odds beat out a field of 19. However, his win earned him top weight of 131 lb (59 kg) at his next race, the Chesterfield Cup, and he could not hold out. =At five years= Leamington ran once at the age of five. He carried 130 lb (59 kg), as the handicapper realized how the horse's owners had been manipulating his races. The weight was too much to carry, and Leamington could not win here either. =At six years= He had a successful start to his six-year-old career, however, winning the Chester Cup easily against a good field. He finished second in his next race, the Gold Vase at Ascot, but his final race of the season, the Goodwood Cup, left him with an injury to his right foreleg. =At seven years= He began training in 1860 as a seven-year- old for The Whip Stakes, a strenuous four-mile race. He broke down while preparing, and was retired to begin his stud career at Rawcliffe Paddocks. Stud record Leamington sired 19 winners of 42 races while at Radwliffe. He was then purchased by the Canadian Roderick W. Cameron for ¬£1,575, and stood at General Abe Buford's Bosque Bonita Stud near Versailles, Kentucky for the 1866 season. He bred only thirteen mares, but produced an outstanding crop of foals, including Longfellow, Enquirer, Lyttleton, Lynchburg, Anna Mace, and Miss Alice. Cameron then sent the stallion to his own Clifton Stud on Staten Island. He was then moved to New Jersey in 1868, before being shipped to Annieswood Farm in 1871. His offspring were now noted for their speed and included Aristides, the winner of the first Kentucky Derby. Leamington was sold to Aristides Welch, who stood the stallion at his Erdenheim Stud, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Leamington finished out his life here, dying on May 6, 1878 at the age of 25. During his breeding career, he was the Leading sire in North America four times, including leading Lexington in 1875 for the first time in 16 years. He also earned this title in 1877, 1879, and 1881.

It is the administrative center of the Ysyk-Ata District (formerly Kant District). Kant was established in 1928. The Kyrgyz word for sugar is \\"kant\\", and the city received its name when a sugar plant was built there in the 1930s. (It is an often repeated myth that the town was named after the German philosopher Immanuel Kant). Kant is an industrial and service center. Among notable local enterprises is the Abdysh Ata Brewery, whose products are well known throughout Kyrgyzstan. During the Soviet era, Kant and its surrounding area were home to many ethnic Germans who had been forcibly relocated to Central Asia in 1941 from the Volga region when the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was abolished. Most left for Germany during the 1990s and after the demise of the Soviet Union when the factories where they had worked shut down. Several other nearby settlements, such as Luxemburg and Bergtal, still carry their German names, but retain only very small remnants of their Volga German and Russian Mennonite founders. Demographics The population of Kant, according to the Population and Housing Census of 2009, was 21,589. Geography =Climate= Kant has humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Dsa). Air base The Kant Air Base near the city is now host to the Russian Air Force's 5th Air and Air Defence Forces Army's 999th Air Base positioned in Kyrgyzstan in response to the United States presence at Manas Air Base. The Kant airbase is also a structural subdivision of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In February 2012, Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev called for the Kant base to be closed, saying neither Russia nor Kyrgyzstan needs it. In May, Col. Gen. Alexander Zelin of the Russian Air Force declared his country had no plan to withdraw from the town of Kant, adding that the base‚Äôs organizational and personnel structure will remain as is.

Seventeenth century, possibly Italian. The history of the camera begins even before the introduction of photography. Cameras evolved from the camera obscura through many generations of photographic technology daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film to the modern day with digital cameras and camera phones.  Camera obscura  An artist using an 18th-century camera obscura to trace an imageThe forerunner to the photographic camera was the camera obscura. Camera obscura (Latin for \\"dark room\\") is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by Han Chinese philosopher Mozi (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because light travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room. The use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project images used as a drawing aid has been traced back to circa 1550. Since the late 17th century portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as a drawing aid. Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Ni√©pce's time portable box camerae obscurae suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible. = Pinhole camera (11th ‚Äì 17th c.) = Pinhole camera. Light enters a dark box through a small hole and creates an inverted image on the wall opposite the hole. Ibn al-Haytham (c. 965‚Äì1040 AD), an Arab physicist also known as Alhazen, wrote very influential essays about the camera obscura, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room. The invention of the camera has been traced back to the work of Ibn al-Haytham, who is credited with the invention of the pinhole camera. While the effects of a single light passing through a pinhole had been described earlier, Ibn al-Haytham gave the first correct analysis of the camera obscura, including the first geometrical and quantitative descriptions of the phenomenon, and was the first to use a screen in a dark room so that an image from one side of a hole in the surface could be projected onto a screen on the other side. He also first understood the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole, and performed early experiments with afterimage. Ibn al-Haytam's writings on optics became very influential in Europe through Latin translations, inspiring people such as Witelo, John Peckham, Roger Bacon, Leonardo Da Vinci, Ren√© Descartes and Johannes Kepler. Camera obscuras were used as drawing aids since at least circa 1550. Since the late 17th century, portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as drawing aids. = Photographic camera (18th ‚Äì 20th c.) = Before the development of the photographic camera, it had been known for hundreds of years that some substances, such as silver salts, darkened when exposed to sunlight. In a series of experiments, published in 1727, the German scientist Johann Heinrich Schulze demonstrated that the darkening of the salts was due to light alone, and not influenced by heat or exposure to air.The Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele showed in 1777 that silver chloride was especially susceptible to darkening from light exposure, and that once darkened, it becomes insoluble in an ammonia solution. The first person to use this chemistry to create images was Thomas Wedgwood. To create images, Wedgwood placed items, such as leaves and insect wings, on ceramic pots coated with silver nitrate, and exposed the set-up to light. These images weren't permanent, however, as Wedgwood didn't employ a fixing mechanism. He ultimately failed at his goal of using the process to create fixed images created by a camera obscura. View from the Window at Le Gras (1825), the earliest surviving photograph The first permanent photograph of a camera image was made in 1825 by Joseph Nic√©phore Ni√©pce using a sliding wooden box camera made by Charles and Vincent Chevalier in Paris. Ni√©pce had been experimenting with ways to fix the images of a camera obscura since 1816. The photograph Ni√©pce succeeded in creating shows the view from his window. It was made using an 8-hour exposure on pewter coated with bitumen. Ni√©pce called his process \\"heliography\\". Ni√©pce corresponded with the inventor Louis-Jacques-Mand√© Daguerre, and the pair entered into a partnership to improve the heliographic process. Ni√©pce had experimented further with other chemicals, to improve contrast in his heliographs. Daguerre contributed an improved camera obscura design, but the partnership ended when Ni√©pce died in 1833. Daguerre succeeded in developing a high-contrast and extremely sharp image by exposing on a plate coated with silver iodide, and exposing this plate again to mercury vapor. By 1837, he was able to fix the images with a common salt solution. He called this process Daguerreotype, and tried unsuccessfully for a couple of years to commercialize it. Eventually, with help of the scientist and politician Fran√ßois Arago, the French government acquired Daguerre's process for public release. In exchange, pensions were provided to Daguerre as well as Ni√©pce's son, Isidore. In the 1830s, the English scientist William Henry Fox Talbot independently invented a process to fix camera images using silver salts. Although dismayed that Daguerre had beaten him to the announcement of photography, on January 31, 1839 he submitted a pamphlet to the Royal Institution entitled Some Account of the Art of Photogenic Drawing, which was the first published description of photography. Within two years, Talbot developed a two-step process for creating photographs on paper, which he called calotypes. The calotyping process was the first to utilize negative prints, which reverse all values in the photograph ‚Äì black shows up as white and vice versa. Negative prints allow, in principle, unlimited duplicates of the positive print to be made. Calotyping also introduced the ability for a printmaker to alter the resulting image through retouching.Calotypes were never as popular or widespread as daguerreotypes, owing mainly to the fact that the latter produced sharper details. However, because daguerreotypes only produce a direct positive print, no duplicates can be made. It is the two-step negative/positive process that formed the basis for modern photography. The Giroux daguerreotype camera, the first to be commercially produced The first photographic camera developed for commercial manufacture was a daguerreotype camera, built by Alphonse Giroux in 1839. Giroux signed a contract with Daguerre and Isidore Ni√©pce to produce the cameras in France, with each device and accessories costing 400 francs. The camera was a double-box design, with a landscape lens fitted to the outer box, and a holder for a ground glass focusing screen and image plate on the inner box. By sliding the inner box, objects at various distances could be brought to as sharp a focus as desired. After a satisfactory image had been focused on the screen, the screen was replaced with a sensitized plate. A knurled wheel controlled a copper flap in front of the lens, which functioned as a shutter. The early daguerreotype cameras required long exposure times, which in 1839 could be from 5 to 30 minutes. After the introduction of the Giroux daguerreotype camera, other manufacturers quickly produced improved variations. Charles Chevalier, who had earlier provided Ni√©pce with lenses, created in 1841 a double-box camera using a half-sized plate for imaging. Chevalier's camera had a hinged bed, allowing for half of the bed to fold onto the back of the nested box. In addition to having increased portability, the camera had a faster lens, bringing exposure times down to 3 minutes, and a prism at the front of the lens, which allowed the image to be laterally correct. Another French design emerged in 1841, created by Marc Antoine Gaudin. The Nouvel Appareil Gaudin camera had a metal disc with three differently-sized holes mounted on the front of the lens. Rotating to a different hole effectively provided variable f-stops, allowing different amounts of light into the camera. Instead of using nested boxes to focus, the Gaudin camera used nested brass tubes. In Germany, Peter Friedrich Voigtl√§nder designed an all-metal camera with a conical shape that produced circular pictures of about 3 inches in diameter. The distinguishing characteristic of the Voigtl√§nder camera was its use of a lens designed by Joseph Petzval. The Petzval lens was nearly 30 times faster than any other lens of the period, and was the first to be made specifically for portraiture. Its design was the most widely used for portraits until Carl Zeiss introduced the anastigmat lens in 1889. Within a decade of being introduced in America, 3 general forms of camera were in popular use: the American- or chamfered-box camera, the Robert's-type camera or ‚ÄúBoston box‚Äù, and the Lewis-type camera. The American-box camera had beveled edges at the front and rear, and an opening in the rear where the formed image could be viewed on ground glass. The top of the camera had hinged doors for placing photographic plates. Inside there was one available slot for distant objects, and another slot in the back for close-ups. The lens was focused either by sliding or with a rack and pinion mechanism. The Robert's-type cameras were similar to the American-box, except for having a knob-fronted worm gear on the front of the camera, which moved the back box for focusing. Many Robert's-type cameras allowed focusing directly on the lens mount. The third popular daguerreotype camera in America was the Lewis-type, introduced in 1851, which utilized a bellows for focusing. The main body of the Lewis-type camera was mounted on the front box, but the rear section was slotted into the bed for easy sliding. Once focused, a set screw was tightened to hold the rear section in place. Having the bellows in the middle of the body facilitated making a second, in-camera copy of the original image. Daguerreotype cameras formed images on silvered copper plates and images were only able to develop with mercury vapor. The earliest daguerreotype cameras required several minutes to half an hour to expose images on the plates. By 1840, exposure times were reduced to just a few seconds owing to improvements in the chemical preparation and development processes, and to advances in lens design. American daguerreotypists introduced manufactured plates in mass production, and plate sizes became internationally standardized: whole plate (6.5 x 8.5 inches), three-quarter plate (5.5 x 7 1/8 inches), half plate (4.5 x 5.5 inches), quarter plate (3.25 x 4.25 inches), sixth plate (2.75 x 3.25 inches), and ninth plate (2 x 2.5 inches). Plates were often cut to fit cases and jewelry with circular and oval shapes. Larger plates were produced, with sizes such as 9 x 13 inches (‚Äúdouble-whole‚Äù plate), or 13.5 x 16.5 inches (Southworth & Hawes‚Äô plate). The collodion wet plate process that gradually replaced the daguerreotype during the 1850s required photographers to coat and sensitize thin glass or iron plates shortly before use and expose them in the camera while still wet. Early wet plate cameras were very simple and little different from Daguerreotype cameras, but more sophisticated designs eventually appeared. The Dubroni of 1864 allowed the sensitizing and developing of the plates to be carried out inside the camera itself rather than in a separate darkroom. Other cameras were fitted with multiple lenses for photographing several small portraits on a single larger plate, useful when making cartes de visite. It was during the wet plate era that the use of bellows for focusing became widespread, making the bulkier and less easily adjusted nested box design obsolete. For many years, exposure times were long enough that the photographer simply removed the lens cap, counted off the number of seconds (or minutes) estimated to be required by the lighting conditions, then replaced the cap. As more sensitive photographic materials became available, cameras began to incorporate mechanical shutter mechanisms that allowed very short and accurately timed exposures to be made. The use of photographic film was pioneered by George Eastman, who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to celluloid in 1889. His first camera, which he called the \\"Kodak,\\" was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple box camera with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras. Films also made possible capture of motion (cinematography) establishing the movie industry by end of 19th century.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nic√©phore Ni√©pce, using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Ni√©pce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Ni√©pce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea. The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived. Daguerreotype camera made by Maison Susse Fr√®res in 1839, with a lens by Charles Chevalier  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Ni√©pce's death in 1830, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.Kosinski Dorothy, The Artist and the Camera, Degas to Picasso. New Haven: Yale University Press,1999. p.25 Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light- sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard. Late 19th century studio camera  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1857, thanks to the work of D√©sir√© van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called \\"instantaneous\\" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. With daylight and a fast plate or film, a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture. The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and informal \\"candid\\" portraits became popular. There was a proliferation of camera designs, from single- and twin-lens reflexes to large and bulky field cameras, simple box cameras, and even \\"detective cameras\\" disguised as pocket watches, hats, or other objects. The short exposure times that made candid photography possible also necessitated another innovation, the mechanical shutter. The very first shutters were separate accessories, though built-in shutters were common by the end of the 19th century.  Kodak and the birth of film  Kodak No. 2 Brownie box camera, circa 1910The use of photographic film was pioneered by George Eastman, who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to celluloid in 1888‚Äì1889. His first camera, which he called the \\"Kodak\\", was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple box camera with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras. In 1900, Eastman took mass-market photography one step further with the Brownie, a simple and very inexpensive box camera that introduced the concept of the snapshot. The Brownie was extremely popular and various models remained on sale until the 1960s. Film also allowed the movie camera to develop from an expensive toy to a practical commercial tool. Despite the advances in low-cost photography made possible by Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with rollfilm cameras, which offered a larger number of exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled rollfilm cameras to use plates. Except for a few special types such as Schmidt cameras, most professional astrographs continued to use plates until the end of the 20th century when electronic photography replaced them.  35 mm  Leica I, 1925Argus C3, 1939 A number of manufacturers started to use 35 mm film for still photography between 1905 and 1913. The first 35 mm cameras available to the public, and reaching significant numbers in sales were the Tourist Multiple, in 1913, and the Simplex, in 1914. Oskar Barnack, who was in charge of research and development at Leitz, decided to investigate using 35 mm cine film for still cameras while attempting to build a compact camera capable of making high-quality enlargements. He built his prototype 35 mm camera (Ur-Leica) around 1913, though further development was delayed for several years by World War I. It wasn't until after World War I that Leica commercialized their first 35 mm Cameras. Leitz test-marketed the design between 1923 and 1924, receiving enough positive feedback that the camera was put into production as the Leica I (for Leitz camera) in 1925. The Leica's immediate popularity spawned a number of competitors, most notably the Contax (introduced in 1932), and cemented the position of 35 mm as the format of choice for high-end compact cameras. Kodak got into the market with the Retina I in 1934, which introduced the 135 cartridge used in all modern 35 mm cameras. Although the Retina was comparatively inexpensive, 35 mm cameras were still out of reach for most people and rollfilm remained the format of choice for mass-market cameras. This changed in 1936 with the introduction of the inexpensive Argus A and to an even greater extent in 1939 with the arrival of the immensely popular Argus C3. Although the cheapest cameras still used rollfilm, 35 mm film had come to dominate the market by the time the C3 was discontinued in 1966. The fledgling Japanese camera industry began to take off in 1936 with the Canon 35 mm rangefinder, an improved version of the 1933 Kwanon prototype. Japanese cameras would begin to become popular in the West after Korean War veterans and soldiers stationed in Japan brought them back to the United States and elsewhere.  TLRs and SLRs  A historic camera: the Contax S of 1949 the first pentaprism SLR Asahiflex IIb, 1954 Nikon F of 1959 the first Japanese system camera The first practical reflex camera was the Franke & Heidecke Rolleiflex medium format TLR of 1928. Though both single- and twin-lens reflex cameras had been available for decades, they were too bulky to achieve much popularity. The Rolleiflex, however, was sufficiently compact to achieve widespread popularity and the medium-format TLR design became popular for both high- and low-end cameras. A similar revolution in SLR design began in 1933 with the introduction of the Ihagee Exakta, a compact SLR which used 127 rollfilm. This was followed three years later by the first Western SLR to use 135 film, the Kine Exakta (World's first true 35mm SLR was Soviet \\"Sport\\" camera, marketed several months before Kine Exakta, though \\"Sport\\" used its own film cartridge). The 35mm SLR design gained immediate popularity and there was an explosion of new models and innovative features after World War II. There were also a few 35 mm TLRs, the best-known of which was the Contaflex of 1935, but for the most part these met with little success. The first major post-war SLR innovation was the eye-level viewfinder, which first appeared on the Hungarian Duflex in 1947 and was refined in 1948 with the Contax S, the first camera to use a pentaprism. Prior to this, all SLRs were equipped with waist-level focusing screens. The Duflex was also the first SLR with an instant-return mirror, which prevented the viewfinder from being blacked out after each exposure. This same time period also saw the introduction of the Hasselblad 1600F, which set the standard for medium format SLRs for decades. In 1952 the Asahi Optical Company (which later became well known for its Pentax cameras) introduced the first Japanese SLR using 135 film, the Asahiflex. Several other Japanese camera makers also entered the SLR market in the 1950s, including Canon, Yashica, and Nikon. Nikon's entry, the Nikon F, had a full line of interchangeable components and accessories and is generally regarded as the first Japanese system camera. It was the F, along with the earlier S series of rangefinder cameras, that helped establish Nikon's reputation as a maker of professional-quality equipment.  Instant cameras  Polaroid Model J66, 1961 While conventional cameras were becoming more refined and sophisticated, an entirely new type of camera appeared on the market in 1948. This was the Polaroid Model 95, the world's first viable instant-picture camera. Known as a Land Camera after its inventor, Edwin Land, the Model 95 used a patented chemical process to produce finished positive prints from the exposed negatives in under a minute. The Land Camera caught on despite its relatively high price and the Polaroid lineup had expanded to dozens of models by the 1960s. The first Polaroid camera aimed at the popular market, the Model 20 Swinger of 1965, was a huge success and remains one of the top-selling cameras of all time.  Automation  The first camera to feature automatic exposure was the selenium light meter-equipped, fully automatic Super Kodak Six-20 pack of 1938, but its extremely high price (for the time) of $225 () kept it from achieving any degree of success. By the 1960s, however, low-cost electronic components were commonplace and cameras equipped with light meters and automatic exposure systems became increasingly widespread. The next technological advance came in 1960, when the German Mec 16 SB subminiature became the first camera to place the light meter behind the lens for more accurate metering. However, through-the-lens metering ultimately became a feature more commonly found on SLRs than other types of camera; the first SLR equipped with a TTL system was the Topcon RE Super of 1962.  Digital cameras  Digital cameras differ from their analog predecessors primarily in that they do not use film, but capture and save photographs on digital memory cards or internal storage instead. Their low operating costs have relegated chemical cameras to niche markets. Digital cameras now include wireless communication capabilities (for example Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) to transfer, print, or share photos, and are commonly found on mobile phones. = Digital imaging technology = The basis for digital camera image sensors is metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology, which originates from the invention of the MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. This led to the development of digital semiconductor image sensors, including the charge-coupled device (CCD) and later the CMOS sensor. The first semiconductor image sensor was the CCD, invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. While researching MOS technology, they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor. As it was fairly straighforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row, they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next. The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting. The NMOS active-pixel sensor (APS) was invented by Olympus in Japan during the mid-1980s. This was enabled by advances in MOS semiconductor device fabrication, with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub- micron levels. The NMOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura's team at Olympus in 1985. The CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) was later developed by Eric Fossum's team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993. Practical digital cameras were enabled by advances in data compression, due to the impractically high memory and bandwidth requirements of uncompressed images and video. The most important compression algorithm is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique that was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed while he was working at the University of Texas in 1972. Practical digital cameras were enabled by DCT-based compression standards, including the H.26x and MPEG video coding standards introduced from 1988 onwards, and the JPEG image compression standard introduced in 1992. = Early digital camera prototypes = The concept of digitizing images on scanners, and the concept of digitizing video signals, predate the concept of making still pictures by digitizing signals from an array of discrete sensor elements. Early spy satellites used the extremely complex and expensive method of de-orbit and airborne retrieval of film canisters. Technology was pushed to skip these steps through the use of in-satellite developing and electronic scanning of the film for direct transmission to the ground. The amount of film was still a major limitation, and this was overcome and greatly simplified by the push to develop an electronic image capturing array that could be used instead of film. The first electronic imaging satellite was the KH-11 launched by the NRO in late 1976. It had a charge-coupled device (CCD) array with a resolution of (0.64 megapixels).globalsecurity.org ‚Äì KH-11 KENNAN, 24 April 2007 At Philips Labs in New York, Edward Stupp, Pieter Cath and Zsolt Szilagyi filed for a patent on \\"All Solid State Radiation Imagers\\" on 6 September 1968 and constructed a flat-screen target for receiving and storing an optical image on a matrix composed of an array of photodiodes connected to a capacitor to form an array of two terminal devices connected in rows and columns. Their US patent was granted on 10 November 1970. Texas Instruments engineer Willis Adcock designed a filmless camera that was not digital and applied for a patent in 1972, but it is not known whether it was ever built. and were filed in 1972 but were only later awarded in 1976 and 1977. The Cromemco Cyclops, introduced as a hobbyist construction project in 1975, was the first digital camera to be interfaced to a microcomputer. Its image sensor was a modified metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) dynamic RAM (DRAM) memory chip. The first recorded attempt at building a self-contained digital camera was in 1975 by Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak. It used the then-new solid-state CCD image sensor chips developed by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1973. The camera weighed 8 pounds (3.6 kg), recorded black-and-white images to a compact cassette tape, had a resolution of 0.01 megapixels (10,000 pixels), and took 23 seconds to capture its first image in December 1975. The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production. = Analog electronic cameras = Sony Mavica, 1981 Handheld electronic cameras, in the sense of a device meant to be carried and used like a handheld film camera, appeared in 1981 with the demonstration of the Sony Mavica (Magnetic Video Camera). This is not to be confused with the later cameras by Sony that also bore the Mavica name. This was an analog camera, in that it recorded pixel signals continuously, as videotape machines did, without converting them to discrete levels; it recorded television-like signals to a 2 √ó 2 inch \\"video floppy\\". In essence it was a video movie camera that recorded single frames, 50 per disk in field mode and 25 per disk in frame mode. The image quality was considered equal to that of then-current televisions. Canon RC-701, 1986 Analog electronic cameras do not appear to have reached the market until 1986 with the Canon RC-701. Canon demonstrated a prototype of this model at the 1984 Summer Olympics, printing the images in the Yomiuri Shinbun, a Japanese newspaper. In the United States, the first publication to use these cameras for real reportage was USA Today, in its coverage of World Series baseball. Several factors held back the widespread adoption of analog cameras; the cost (upwards of $20,000, ), poor image quality compared to film, and the lack of quality affordable printers. Capturing and printing an image originally required access to equipment such as a frame grabber, which was beyond the reach of the average consumer. The \\"video floppy\\" disks later had several reader devices available for viewing on a screen, but were never standardized as a computer drive. The early adopters tended to be in the news media, where the cost was negated by the utility and the ability to transmit images by telephone lines. The poor image quality was offset by the low resolution of newspaper graphics. This capability to transmit images without a satellite link was useful during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the first Gulf War in 1991. US government agencies also took a strong interest in the still video concept, notably the US Navy for use as a real time air-to-sea surveillance system. The first analog electronic camera marketed to consumers may have been the Casio VS-101 in 1987. A notable analog camera produced the same year was the Nikon QV-1000C, designed as a press camera and not offered for sale to general users, which sold only a few hundred units. It recorded images in greyscale, and the quality in newspaper print was equal to film cameras. In appearance it closely resembled a modern digital single-lens reflex camera. Images were stored on video floppy disks. Silicon Film, a proposed digital sensor cartridge for film cameras that would allow 35 mm cameras to take digital photographs without modification was announced in late 1998. Silicon Film was to work like a roll of 35 mm film, with a 1.3 megapixel sensor behind the lens and a battery and storage unit fitting in the film holder in the camera. The product, which was never released, became increasingly obsolete due to improvements in digital camera technology and affordability. Silicon Films' parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2001. = Early true digital cameras = The first portable digital SLR camera, introduced by Minolta in 1995. Nikon D1, 1999 By the late 1980s, the technology required to produce truly commercial digital cameras existed. The first true portable digital camera that recorded images as a computerized file was likely the Fuji DS-1P of 1988, which recorded to a 2 MB SRAM (static RAM) memory card that used a battery to keep the data in memory. This camera was never marketed to the public. The first digital camera of any kind ever sold commercially was possibly the MegaVision Tessera in 1987 though there is not extensive documentation of its sale known. The first portable digital camera that was actually marketed commercially was sold in December 1989 in Japan, the DS-X by FujiHistory of the digital camera and digital imaging The first commercially available portable digital camera in the United States was the Dycam Model 1, first shipped in November 1990. It was originally a commercial failure because it was black-and-white, low in resolution, and cost nearly $1,000 (). It later saw modest success when it was re-sold as the Logitech Fotoman in 1992. It used a CCD image sensor, stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for download.Carolyn Said, \\"DYCAM Model 1: The first portable Digital Still Camera\\", MacWeek, vol. 4, No. 35, 16 Oct. 1990, p. 34. = Digital SLRs (DSLRs) = Nikon was interested in digital photography since the mid-1980s. In 1986, while presenting to Photokina, Nikon introduced an operational prototype of the first SLR-type digital camera (Still Video Camera), manufactured by Panasonic.David D. Busch (2011), Nikon D70 Digital Field Guide, page 11, John Wiley & Sons The Nikon SVC was built around a sensor 2/3 \\" charge-coupled device of 300,000 pixels. Storage media, a magnetic floppy inside the camera allows recording 25 or 50 B&W; images, depending on the definition.Nikon SLR-type digital cameras, Pierre Jarleton In 1988, Nikon released the first commercial DSLR camera, the QV-1000C. In 1991, Kodak brought to market the Kodak DCS (Kodak Digital Camera System), the beginning of a long line of professional Kodak DCS SLR cameras that were based in part on film bodies, often Nikons. It used a 1.3 megapixel sensor, had a bulky external digital storage system and was priced at $13,000 (). At the arrival of the Kodak DCS-200, the Kodak DCS was dubbed Kodak DCS-100. The move to digital formats was helped by the formation of the first JPEG and MPEG standards in 1988, which allowed image and video files to be compressed for storage. The first consumer camera with a liquid crystal display on the back was the Casio QV-10 developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995. The first camera to use CompactFlash was the Kodak DC-25 in 1996.. The first camera that offered the ability to record video clips may have been the Ricoh RDC-1 in 1995. In 1995 Minolta introduced the RD-175, which was based on the Minolta 500si SLR with a splitter and three independent CCDs. This combination delivered 1.75M pixels. The benefit of using an SLR base was the ability to use any existing Minolta AF mount lens. 1999 saw the introduction of the Nikon D1, a 2.74 megapixel camera that was the first digital SLR developed entirely from the ground up by a major manufacturer, and at a cost of under $6,000 () at introduction was affordable by professional photographers and high-end consumers. This camera also used Nikon F-mount lenses, which meant film photographers could use many of the same lenses they already owned. Digital camera sales continued to flourish, driven by technology advances. The digital market segmented into different categories, Compact Digital Still Cameras, Bridge Cameras, Mirrorless Compacts and Digital SLRs. Since 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras and Kodak announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the developed world ‚Äì and 2012 filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry. = Camera phones = The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999. It was called a \\"mobile videophone\\" at the time, and had a 110,000-pixel front-facing camera. It stored up to 20 JPEG digital images, which could be sent over e-mail, or the phone could send up to two images per second over Japan's Personal Handy- phone System (PHS) cellular network. The Samsung SCH-V200, released in South Korea in June 2000, was also one of the first phones with a built-in camera. It had a TFT liquid-crystal display (LCD) and stored up to 20 digital photos at 350,000-pixel resolution. However, it could not send the resulting image over the telephone function, but required a computer connection to access photos. The first mass-market camera phone was the J-SH04, a Sharp J-Phone model sold in Japan in November 2000. It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication. One of the major technology advances was the development of CMOS sensors, which helped drive sensor costs low enough to enable the widespread adoption of camera phones. Smartphones now routinely include high resolution digital cameras.

He is the founder of independent record label Earache Records. Born and raised in Nottingham, UK he was introduced to extreme music whilst playing in local bands, one of which being DIY punk band Scum Dribblurzzz, who never released any records or accepted payment for playing shows. In the mid-1980s, he founded Earache, and gradually began releasing records. He says the first year of business, 1986, was spent doing very little. He claims he initially set up the label as a way to continue to claim social security benefits without having to go to the unemployment office every two weeks, saying, \\"I didn't fancy doing that\\". He started releasing Flexi discs, and then moved on to putting out a split between Concrete Sox and Heresy, and an album by The Acc√ºsed. In 1987 he compiled two sessions by different line-ups of the band Napalm Death, and released them as the album Scum. The album proved popular, peaking at 7 on the indie chart and receiving airplay on John Peel's show on BBC Radio 1. Both Napalm Death and Heresy are considered to be pioneering grindcore bands. Pearson is responsible for signing many pioneering heavy bands including Bolt Thrower, Carcass, Cathedral, Godflesh, Anal Cunt, Entombed, Morbid Angel as well as Deicide, Mortiis, and The Berzerker, as well as releasing more techno-oriented music, and reissues of the label's earlier albums.

It has produced numerous National Champions and Olympians. History The Fencers Club was founded in 1883 by Charles de Kay and other New Yorkers. One had to be in the Social Register to be a member. Its first fencing master was Captain Hippolyte Nicolas, a French officer who had fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, who was partial to the Italian school of fencing. In 1892 it had about 200 members. In 1902 annual dues at the club were $30 ($ in current dollar terms). In 1914, one third of its members were women. Rene Pinchart, a Belgian sergeant major in World War I, was fencing master at the club from 1927 to 1955. French-American Michel Alaux was fencing master of the club from 1956 until 1974. In 2012, the Fencers Club became only the ninth organization to be recognized by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as a Community Olympic Development Program (CODP), for its innovative and world-class programs that embody the Olympic ideals.

It stars Owen Wilson, Kate Hudson, Matt Dillon, Seth Rogen, Amanda Detmer, Todd Stashwick, and Michael Douglas. The film revolves around newlyweds Carl and Molly Peterson (Dillon and Hudson). After Carl's best man and best friend Randolph \\"Randy\\" Dupree (Wilson) loses his job and home, the couple allow him to move in but Dupree overstays his welcome. Protective father Bob Thompson (Douglas) takes a disliking to son-in-law Carl and works against him. Plot Molly (Kate Hudson) and Carl (Matt Dillon) are preparing for their wedding day in Hawaii, until Carl's friend Neil (Seth Rogen) interrupts to say that Randolph Dupree (Owen Wilson) got lost. They drive off together to pick up Dupree, who appeared to have hitched a ride with a light plane after landing on the wrong island. A day before the wedding, Molly's father, Bob Thompson (Michael Douglas), who is also CEO of the company that Carl works for, makes a toast with rude jokes about Carl, foreshadowing a conflict between the two. Later at a pre-celebration at a bar, Carl neglects Dupree to be with Molly. Carl and Dupree later make up on the beach, as Dupree apologizes for laughing at Bob's jokes. Carl and Molly get married. When Carl returns to work, he is surprised to find that Bob has promoted him to be in charge of a design he proposed, though it had been altered somewhat. Bob makes absurd requests which proceed to get worse, starting with his drastic reimagining of Carl's new architecture project and that Carl get a vasectomy to prevent any future children with Molly. Before returning home to celebrate his promotion with Molly, Carl stops by the bar, where he finds Neil and Dupree. After Neil leaves, Dupree reveals that he has financial problems, such as being evicted from his home and losing his job and car. Carl and Molly take Dupree into their home, though clearly they are frustrated as he is disruptive and messy. Molly sets up Dupree with a woman at her work, a primary school, who is a Mormon librarian. Dupree agrees, though Molly is shocked to find them having sex when she comes home from dinner. Romantic candles burn down the front of the living room, and Dupree is kicked out. Meanwhile, Carl is being continually stressed out from work, though he and Molly find time to go out for dinner. On the way back they find Dupree sitting on a bench in heavy rain with his belongings. Dupree reveals that the librarian had just dumped him. Feeling pity, Molly insists they take him back in. Dupree apologizes for being disruptive and agrees to mend his ways. The next day, Dupree makes amends, refurbishing the living room, and doing Carl's thank-you letters, as well as making friends with kids from the block. Dupree cooks a large dinner for Molly and Carl, though Carl is late again, so Molly and Dupree start without him. When Carl finally shows up, he is a little jealous that they were having dinner together, and have a fight. Carl kicks Dupree out, suspecting an affair, which shocks Dupree. The following night, Bob comes over for dinner. Dupree attempts to sneak back in to their home to get some of his belongings, but fails and falls off the roof. He is found outside and is invited in for dinner. After Bob takes a liking to Dupree and asks him to go fishing with him, it enrages Carl because - even though he doesn't like fishing - it's Bob's way of approving someone. Carl's fury boils over as he then imagines Dupree hanging out with Bob and engaging in sex with Molly, causing Carl to jump across the table and attempting to strangle Dupree; Bob hits Carl over the head with a candlestick shortly after. After returning from the hospital with a neck brace, Dupree and Molly confront Bob about what he really thinks of Carl. The next morning, Dupree gets all the local kids to search for Carl. Dupree eventually finds Carl in the bar, and convinces him to chase after Molly. Dupree helps Carl break into Bob's office and confront him while Dupree himself distracts and evades a Samoan guard. Carl and Bob finally reach an understanding and Bob admits to his agenda of mistreatment. Dupree and Carl return to the house, where Carl and Molly reunite, Carl apologizing, and agree to work it all out. Glad that he did his job, Dupree celebrates by leaping into the air with joy, until he falls to ground. All turns out well, with Dupree becoming a motivational speaker, Carl and Molly spending more time with each other, and Bob accepting Carl as family.

Liufau as Paco Production The film's production budget totalled $54 million. Composer Rolfe Kent scored the film, and at the very last minute‚Äîa mere week before the press screenings‚Äîhis score was replaced by one written by Theodore Shapiro. The scene that has Dupree arriving by plane on the wrong island was shot in the same valley as Jurassic Park. In the special features of the film, there is a different version trailer of You, Me and Dupree where in the trailer Dupree and Molly are married and Carl moves in. The DVD release of the film also contains a re-cut trailer horror/thriller version of the film. Reception =Critical response= The film received negative reviews from critics. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 20% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 166 reviews, with an average rating of 4.35/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"A rather generic entry into the arrested development subgenre, with themes borrowed from other more successful and funnier films. Dupree wears out its welcome.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Jim Emerson gave the film 2 stars out of 4, and compared the film to many other predecessors, suggesting Dupree is a 'descendant' of Dignan also played by Wilson in Bottle Rocket, and that the film is at times like a version of Fatal Attraction, but criticizes the film for never properly deciding if Dupree is merely unlucky or actually manipulative. Ebert describes the film as having an \\"Idiot Plot\\" requiring characters to behave in unnatural ways for laughs or to force the plot forward, the comedy equivalent of \\"Don't go down to the cellar!\\" in horror movies. =Box office= On release for 84 days, the film grossed $75,628,110 at the North American domestic box office, and in addition earned $54,803,258 in international markets, for a worldwide total of $130,431,368. =Steely Dan response= The film's title caused a minor stir as the uncommon name, Dupree, is the same as the title character in the Steely Dan song \\"Cousin Dupree\\" from their 2000 album, Two Against Nature which also concerns a ne'er-do-well relative who becomes a problem houseguest.

In 1897 he dug a well beneath his winery and discovered a large vug at a depth of 30 feet (10 m). On exploring the cave he found the cave walls covered with extremely large and well-developed tabular crystals identified as celestine, a form of strontium sulfate. The original cave was much smaller than it is today, as much of the celestine was mined for the manufacturing of red fireworks, which get their color from the presence of strontium cations as pyrotechnic colorant. However, Mr. Heineman decided to stop the mining and turn the property into a tourist attraction. Due to the Crystal Cave, the Heineman winery survived prohibition because of tourist revenues. As of 2016, the Crystal Cave is open for tourism, where celestine crystals of up to 3 feet (1 m) in width can be viewed.

The spider can be found throughout Japan (except Hokkaid≈ç), in Korea, Taiwan, China, and more recently, northeast Georgia in North America. Due to the large size as well as the bright, unique colors of the female Trichonephila, the spider is well-favored in Japan. In 2015 scientists confirmed the first known occurrence of Trichonephila clavata in North America. In 2019, this species was moved from the genus Nephila to Trichonephila. Characteristics female from below Trichonephila clavata pass winter as eggs and scatter as tiny juveniles in the spring. The adult female's body size is 17‚Äì25 mm, while the male's is 7‚Äì10 mm. The web of female Trichonephila can reach one meter in length; the yellow threads appear rich gold in sunlight. The structure of the web seen in cross-section is unusual for an orb web; it has 3 layers: the central orb, plus 2 irregular layers in front and behind the orb. The adult female individual has stripes of yellow and dark blue, with red towards the rear of the abdomen. In autumn, smaller male(s) may be seen in the female's web for copulating. After mating the female spins an egg sack on a tree, laying 400 - 1500 eggs in one sack. The life cycle ends by late autumn or early winter. Silk Researchers, led by Masao Nakagaki, at Shinshu University, Japan have succeeded in creating a silk thread that is stronger, softer and more durable than conventional silk by injecting silkworm eggs with genes of the spider. The silkworms that hatch weave cocoons containing 10% spider protein. The dragline silk is said to have many uses, such as: bulletproof vests, sutures after an operation, tennis rackets, fishing line, and nets. A Japanese manufacturer named Okamoto had begun developing commercial applications for the spider silk, and planned to release extra-thin, durable spider socks by year 2010. In folklore Jor≈çgumo is a legendary creature in Japanese folklore. A Jor≈çgumo is a spider that can change its appearance into that of a beautiful woman. She seeks men to seduce, whom she then binds in her silk and devours. This Jor≈ç Spider (Trichonephila clavata) was about 5 cm long. It is a member of the golden orb- web spider group.

He served as general manager of three American League (AL) teams, the Baltimore Orioles (1966‚Äì71), California Angels (1972‚Äì77) and Milwaukee Brewers (1978‚Äì91), and was a principal architect of the Orioles' dynasty of 1966‚Äì74 as well as the only AL championship the Brewers ever won (1982). Born in West Springfield, Massachusetts‚Äîalso the hometown of Baseball Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher‚ÄîDalton graduated from Amherst College and served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War, earning a Bronze Star. After a brief stint as a sportswriter in Springfield, he joined the front office of the Orioles, newly reborn as the relocated St. Louis Browns, in 1954. For the next 11 years, Dalton worked his way up the organizational ladder, rising to the position of director of the Orioles' successful farm system in 1961.Voiss, Dale, \\"Harry Dalton.\\" Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project In the autumn of 1965, Baltimore general manager Lee MacPhail departed to become top aide to the new Commissioner of Baseball, William Eckert. Dalton was named Director of Player Personnel‚Äîin effect, MacPhail's successor as head of baseball operations. His first order of business was to complete a trade that brought Cincinnati Reds outfielder Frank Robinson to Baltimore for pitchers Milt Pappas and Jack Baldschun and outfielder Dick Simpson. Robinson, 1961 National League Most Valuable Player, was one of the greatest stars in the game, but he had developed a strained relationship with the Cincinnati front office.Shinkle, Andrew, \\"Revisiting the Frank Robinson Trade.\\" RedReporter/SBNation In Baltimore, he would team with third baseman Brooks Robinson to lead the O's to the 1966 and 1970 World Series championships, and pennants in 1969 and 1971.The Associated Press (23 October 2005), \\"Former Orioles, Brewers GM Harry Dalton Dead at 77.\\" ESPN.com Dalton was the man who hired Earl Weaver as manager, brought to the Majors young stars such as Bobby Grich and Don Baylor, and acquired key players such as Mike Cuellar, Pat Dobson and Don Buford. (Weaver, Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson, along with pitching great Jim Palmer, a product of Dalton's farm system, are all in the Hall in Fame.) After the Orioles lost the 1971 World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates, Dalton was hired to turn around a stumbling Angels franchise. He acquired the great pitcher Nolan Ryan in a December 1971 trade with the New York Mets, but during Dalton's six seasons in Anaheim the team never posted a winning record. After the 1977 season, the Angels hired veteran executive Buzzie Bavasi as Dalton's boss, then released Dalton from his contract so that he could become the general manager of the Brewers. Milwaukee had a group of talented young players, such as Robin Yount, Cecil Cooper and rookie Paul Molitor, but the nine-year-old franchise had never had a winning season. In 1978, Dalton hired George Bamberger, Weaver's pitching coach for many years, as the Brewers' new manager, and the team gelled into contenders in the American League East Division. By 1981, they made the playoffs and in 1982, Milwaukee won its first and only American League pennant (the Brewers moved to the National League Central Division in 1998). In the 1982 World Series, the \\"Harvey's Wallbangers\\" Brewers of manager Harvey Kuenn lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The Brewers contended in , but then began to struggle on the field. The team rebounded in and , but when it returned to its losing ways, Dalton's position was weakened. After a poor season, he was replaced as general manager by Sal Bando. Dalton, who remained a consultant in the Milwaukee front office through his 1994 retirement, nevertheless was one of the most respected men in baseball, who had trained other successful general managers such as John Schuerholz, Lou Gorman and Dan Duquette, a fellow Amherst alumnus. On July 24, 2003, Dalton was inducted into the Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame outside Miller Park. Harry Dalton died at age 77 in Scottsdale, Arizona, of complications from Lewy body disease, misdiagnosed as Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

A moon clip is a ring-shaped or star-shaped piece of metal designed to hold multiple cartridges together as a unit, for simultaneous insertion and extraction from a revolver cylinder. Moon clips may either hold an entire cylinder's worth of cartridges together (full moon clip), half a cylinder (half-moon clip), or just two neighboring cartridges. The two- cartridge moon clips can be used for those revolvers that have an odd number of loading chambers such as five or seven and also for those revolvers that allow a shooter to mix both rimless and rimmed types of cartridges in one loading of the same cylinder (e.g., 2 adjacent rounds of .45 ACP, 2 rounds of .45 Colt, and 2 rounds of .410 in a single six-chamber S&W; Governor cylinder). Moon clips can be used either to chamber rimless cartridges in a double-action revolver (which would normally require rimmed cartridges), or to chamber multiple rimmed cartridges simultaneously. Moon clips are generally made from spring grade steel, although plastic versions have also been produced. Unlike a speedloader, a moon clip remains in place during firing, and after firing, is used to extract the empty cartridge cases. History Smith & Wesson 1917 with .45 ACP moon clips and two auto rim cartridges The modern moon clip was devised shortly before World War I in 1908., Elmer E. Neal The device then became widespread during the war, when the relatively new M1911 semi-automatic pistol could not be manufactured fast enough for the war effort. The U.S. War Department asked Smith & Wesson and Colt to devise ways to use the M1911's .45 ACP rimless cartridge in their revolvers. The result was the M1917 revolver, employing moon clips to chamber the military-issue .45 ACP ammunition.Josserand MH, Stevenson JA: Pistols, revolvers, and ammunition. New York, Bonanza Books (a division of Crown Publishers), 1972, p. 143, 263. Smith & Wesson invented and patented the half-moon clip, but at the request of the Army allowed Colt to also use the design free of charge in their own version of the M1917 revolver. Moon Clips can be formed by stamped high carbon steel, heat treated and finished to prevent rust. Alternatively they can be made from pre-heat treated stainless steel and cut out using either wire EDM or Laser machinery. They can also be made by injection molding plastic. Each process has its benefits and drawbacks such as cost and durability. Speed Moon clips can even be faster to use than a speedloader with the proper training. Jerry Miculek, an IPSC revolver shooter, has demonstrated the ability to fire six shots from a .45 ACP revolver, reload, and fire six more shots to the 6√ó11-inch A zone of an IPSC target at in under three seconds. This feat was possible by using moon clips to allow quick and reliable ejection of the fired rounds, and a quick reload of all six chambers at once.

While open adoption is a relatively new phenomenon in the west, it has been a traditional practice in many Asian societies, especially in South Asia, for many centuries. In Hindu society, for example, it is relatively common for a childless couple to adopt the second or later son of the husband's brother when the childless couple has limited hope of producing their own child. In Open Adoption, the adoptive parents hold all the rights as the legal parents, yet the individuals of the biological and adoptive families may exercise the option to open the contact in varying forms: from just sending mail and/or photos, to face-to-face visits between birth and adoptive families. History of openness in adoption Although open adoptions are thought to be a relatively new phenomenon, most adoptions in the United States until the twentieth century were open. Until the 1930s, most adoptive parents and biological parents had contact at least during the adoption process. In many cases, adoption was seen as a social support: young children were adopted out not only to help their parents (by reducing the number of children they had to support) but also to help another family by providing an apprentice. Adoptions became closed when social pressures mandated that families preserve the myth that they were formed biologically. One researcher has referred to these families, that made every attempt to match the child physically to their adoptive families, as 'as if' families. Open adoption has slowly become more common since research in the 1970s suggested that open adoption was better for children. In 1975 the tide began to change, and by the early 1990s open adoptions were offered by a majority of American adoption agencies.http://writepass.co.uk/journal/2012/12/open- adoption/ Especially rapid progress was seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s - between 1987 and 1989 a study found only a third of agencies offered fully open adoption as an option; by 1993 76 percent of the surveyed agencies offered fully open adoptions. As of 2013, roughly half of US states consider them legally binding, however contact in open adoption is not always maintained. The social stigma of unmarried mothers, particularly during the Baby Scoop Era (1945-1975) rendered them social outcasts. By the 1980s the situation improved greatly and the vast majority of unwed mothers kept their babies.http://babyscoopera.com/ In a mother driven society after WWII infertile couples were also seen as deviant due to their inability to bear children. The social experiment of taking the children from \\"unmarried mothers\\" and \\"giving them\\" to adoptive parents became the norm during the BSE. These adoptions were predominantly closed. The records were sealed, biological mothers were told to keep their child a secret, and adoptive parents told to treat the child \\"as if born to\\". According to a 2012 report in the Washington Times 95% of US infant adoptions now have some level of openness between adoptive and birth parents.Lori Holden: The Open-Hearted Way to Open Adoption: Helping Your Child Grow Up Whole, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2013, p. 3., Pre-birth openness in the United States In the past when an American birth mother would go to an adoption agency to place her child for adoption, the agency took full responsibility in selecting the adoptive family, with the birth mother playing no role. Most adoption agencies in the US since the early 1990s have offered some, or complete, openness. Although practices vary state by state, most adoptions start with the birth mother reviewing dozens of adoption profile books https://www.ourchosenchild.com/samples-examples or online profiles of prospective adoptive parents. Usually, these are adoptive families who have retained that agency or attorney to assist them in the adoption process. Most US states permit full openness not just regarding identities, but also personal information about each other. Just as the adoptive parents want to learn about the birth mother's life and health history, so does the birth mother want the same information about the people she is considering as the parents for her child.RAISING ADOPTED CHILDREN, by Lois Melina, Harper Paperbacks, 1993 When the birth mother has narrowed down her prospective adoptive parents to one or a few families, normally they arrange to meet in person.http://www.allforchildren.org/for-birth- parents/your-adoption-choices.php Good adoption agencies and attorneys do this in a pressure-free setting where no one is encouraged to make an immediate decision. If they are geographically distant from each other (as some adoptions are interstate, with the birth mother living in a different state from the adoptive parents), the first meeting will normally be by phone, then advance to a face-to-face meeting if the meeting by phone went as well as hoped. Many birth mothers do more than just meet the adoptive parents once before the birth.DEAR BIRTH MOTHER, by Kathleen Silber and Phylis Speedlin, Corona Publishing 1991 If they live close enough to each other it is not uncommon for the birth mother to invite the adoptive mother (or adoptive father too if the birth mother wishes) to come to her doctor appointments. This may allow all parties to the adoption a chance to bond. Adoptive parents may be present for the delivery if that is the birth mother's wish.DEAR BIRTH MOTHER, by Silber and Speedlin Post-birth openness Although pre-birth openness is becoming routine in newborn adoptions there are more variations in the years following the birth, after the adoption has been completed. Some birth mothers want to get to know the adoptive parents before the birth, but then wish to go \\"their own way\\" in life thereafter. Getting to know the adoptive family gives her confidence in the placement and the knowledge she can feel secure in the child's future with the parents (or single parent) she selected. The birth mother may feel that future contact with the adoptive parents, or the child, would be emotionally difficult for her.THE OPEN ADOPTION EXPERIENCE, by Lois Melina and Sharon Kaplan Roszia, Harper Paperbacks, 1993 Likely the most common arrangement in open adoptions is for the adoptive parents to commit to sending the birth mother photos of the child (and themselves as a family) each year, and short written updates, until the child reaches the age of 18.ADOPTION: THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO ADOPTING QUICKLY AND SAFELY, by Randall Hicks, Perigee Press 2007 Often these photos and updates will be sent more than just once a year, such as the child's birthday or other significant events. Sometimes an intermediary is selected to receive and forward the updates, and sometimes it is done directly. This can be through mail or email. Some adoptions are more open than just sending photos and updates and include face-to-face contact. The amount of contact can vary greatly from just once in the first year, to multiple times annually throughout the child's life.ADOPTION: THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO ADOPTING QUICKLY AND SAFELY, by Hicks Some of the adoptees raised in open adoption are now in adulthood and are writing about the experience of growing up in an open adoption.http://www.sisterwish.com/ Oftentimes the birth and adoptive parents will sign a Post-Adoption Contract (sometimes called an Open Adoption Agreement), putting in writing any promises regarding contact after the adoption is finalized. Even in those states which do not expressly have laws in this area, these agreements can usually be prepared if the parties desire to formalize the agreement. In an increasing number of US states, courts will find these agreements legally enforceable, as long as they serve the best interests of the child. It is not unusual for these agreements to be more like \\"handshake\\" agreements, although they offer less protection to a birth parent if the adoptive parent's promises were not honored.THE OPEN ADOPTION EXPERIENCE, by Melina and Roszia Birth fathers There are sometimes problems concerning birth mothers and adoption agencies who neglect to make sure the proper paperwork is done on the birth father's part. It is crucial to remember that no child can be relinquished legally without the birth father's consent, except in Utah. He must be given the chance to claim custody of the child. For this purpose, many states have established a Putative father registry, although some adoption activists see these as a hindrance rather than a help. Older children The placement of older children can take two widely divergent paths. Generally speaking when a child has bonded to a birth parent then a need for an adoptive placement arises, it is usually critical for that child's emotional welfare to maintain ties with the birth parent. Sometimes a parent raised a child, but a problem has arisen, and parenting is no longer possible, and there are no family members able to take over the parenting role, so adoption is the best option.MAKING ROOM IN OUR HEARTS, by Duxbury Another way older children can be placed for adoption is where the birth parents' rights were terminated by a court due to improper parenting or abuse. Although the child may still foster idealized feelings for that failing parent it is not uncommon in these adoptions for there to be no contact between the child and adoptive parent, and the birth parent. Access to birth records At age 18, people adopted in the United Kingdom, Australia, and in several provinces in Canada are automatically entitled to their birth certificates and may access their adoption records if in fact they are even aware that they are adopted. In nearly all US states adoption records are sealed and withheld from public inspection after the adoption is finalized. Most states have instituted procedures by which parties to an adoption may obtain non-identifying and identifying information from an adoption record while still protecting the interests of all parties. Non-identifying information includes the date and place of the adoptee's birth; age, race, ethnicity, religion, medical history, physical description, education, occupation of the biological parents; reason for placing the child for adoption; and the existence of biological siblings. All states allow an adoptive parents access to non-identifying information of an adoptee who is still a minor. Nearly all states allow the adoptee, upon reaching adulthood, access to non-identifying information about their relatives. Approximately 27 states allow biological parents access to non-identifying information. In addition many states give such access to adult siblings. Identifying information is any data that may lead to the positive identification of an adoptee, biological parents, or other relatives. Nearly all states permit the release of identifying information when the person whose information is sought has consented to the release. Many states ask biological parents to specify at the time of consent or surrender whether they are willing to have their identity disclosed to the adoptee when he or she is age 18 or 21.5. If consent is not on file, the information may not be released without a court order documenting good cause to release the information. A person seeking a court order must be able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that there is a compelling reason for disclosure that outweighs maintaining the confidentiality of a party to an adoption. In Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Oregon, there is no requirement to document good cause in order to access their birth certificates.http://www.post- gazette.com/pg/07316/833100-84.stm Retrieved 29 February 2008http://www.unsealedinitiative.org/html/articles.html Accessed: 2 March 2008 Accessed: 2 March 2008http://adoption.about.com/od/adoptionrights/a/openingrecords.htm Accessed: 2 March 2008 Some groups, such as Bastard Nation, One Voice,One Voice, No Secrets Available: http://www.onevoicenosecrets.org/main/ Accessed: 27 April 2008. and Origins USA,Origins USA position papers Available: Accessed: 27 April 2008. campaign for adoptees' automatic access to birth certificates in other US states.

Depictions of Vajrayogini typically contain the kartika as one of her attributes.

Meanings As one author writes about the meaning of the kartika: The kartika is used to symbolize the severance of all material and worldly bonds and is often crowned with a vajra, which is said to destroy ignorance, and thus leading to enlightenment. Another more nuanced interpretation says that \\"the kartika represents the severing of the two Buddhist obscurations of defilements (klesha avarana) and knowledge (jneya avarana) that obstruct the path of enlightenment.\\"John Huntington and Dina Bangdel.

Biography Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine was born in Kherson, Russian Empire (present day Ukraine) under the name Shulim Wolf Leib Baranov. In 1902 he studied at the School of the Society for the Furthering of the Arts in St. Petersburg. From 1903 to 1907 he attended the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. In 1908 he exhibited with the group Zveno (The Link) in Kiev organized by the artist David Burliuk and his brother Wladimir Burliuk. In 1910 he moved to Paris, where until 1914 he was a resident in the artist's colony La Ruche together with Alexander Archipenko, Sonia Delaunay-Terk, Nathan Altman and others. He exhibited regularly in Paris after 1911. He returned to Russia in 1914. In 1916 he had a solo exhibition in Oslo. In 1918 he had exhibits with the union of artists Mir Iskusstva (World of Art) in Petrograd (St.Petersburg). In the same year, he had an exhibition with the group Jewish Society for the Furthering of the Arts in Moscow, together with Nathan Altman, El Lissitzky and David Shterenberg. He participated at the First State Free Art Exhibition in Petrograd in 1919. In 1922 Baranoff-Rossine was the teacher at the Higher Artistic-Technical Workshops (VKhUTEMAS) in Moscow. and exhibited in the First Russian Art Exhibition in Berlin. In 1924 he had the first presentation of his optophonic piano during a performance at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow - a synaesthetic instrument that was capable of creating sounds and coloured lights, patterns and textures simultaneously. In 1925 he emigrated to France. Continuously experimenting, Baranoff-Rossine applied the art of colour to military art with the technique of camouflage or the Cameleon process and this was marketed with Robert Delaunay.

It is generally considered the second most important acting troupe of English Renaissance theatre (after the company of Shakespeare, the Lord Chamberlain's or King's Men).Halliday, p. 23. Beginnings They were first known as the Lord Howard's Men, named after their patron Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham. The company played once at Court on December 1576 (the play was called Tooley), again on 17 February 1577 (The Solitary Knight), and a third time the following Christmas season, 5 January 1578 (all dates new style). They toured widely, from Bath to Nottingham, in the years 1577-79\\\\. A powerful patron like Howard could make a great difference in a company's fortunes. Though there is little evidence that he was actively concerned with drama, Howard was almost alone among Elizabeth's closest councillors in opposing the Lord Mayor of London's 1584 drive to close the public theatres. The theatres stayed open.Kenny, pp. 31‚Äì2. When Howard became England's Lord High Admiral in 1585, the group's name was changed to reflect his new title. They performed regularly in the provinces and at Court in the 1585-87 period; but a fatal accident at one of their performances forced them into a temporary retirement. (During a performance in London on 16 November 1587, stage gunfire went wrong, killing a child and a pregnant woman.)Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 135. But they returned to activity with two performances at Court in the winter of 1588-9, on 29 December and 11 February. Despite the power of their patron, the Admiral's Men were not entirely free of official interference. Both they and the Lord Strange's Men were stopped from playing by the Lord Mayor of London in November 1589; it seems that Edmund Tilney, the Master of the Revels, had taken a dislike to their choice of plays. During this period of difficulty the Admiral's Men moved into James Burbage's The Theatre for a time (November 1590 to May 1591), and there they played Dead Man's Fortune with a young Richard Burbage in the cast ‚Äì the only time that the later competitors Burbage and Edward Alleyn, the longtime star of the Admiral's, are known to have acted together. If the Admiral's Men were having difficulties in the city in this period, they were still welcome at Court (28 December 1589; 30 March 1590), and still popular in the towns and shires, where they toured more in 1589-90\\\\. Indeed, this was perhaps the height of their achievement: in these years Alleyn was making a sensation acting the heroes of Christopher Marlowe. Tamburlaine was printed in 1590 with their name on its title page. Some of the plays of Robert Greene, and Thomas Lodge's The Wounds of Civil War, were also in their repertory in the early 1590s. Henslowe years It was during the later 1580s that the company established its long-term relationship with Philip Henslowe, theatre builder, producer, impresario. Henslowe's Rose Theatre was home to the Admiral's Men for a number of years, and Henslowe played a key role as a blend of manager and financier. After the major disruption of the 1592-94 era, when the public theatres endured a long closure due to bubonic plague, the Admiral's Men entered another lush period in 1594 and after. The re- constituted company resumed performances on 14 May 1594, with The Jew of Malta and two anonymous and lost plays, The Ranger's Comedy and Cutlack.Halliday, p. 24. The Admiral's Men had Edward Alleyn as their leading man; other personnel included George Attewell, Thomas Downton, and James Tunstall, all veterans of the earlier pre-1592 version of the Admiral's, and Richard Jones, a former mate of Alleyn's and Tunstall's in Worcester's Men in the 1580s. (Jones and Downton would defect to Pembroke's Men in early 1597, only to be caught up in their disastrous performance of The Isle of Dogs, and return to the Admiral's by the end of that year.) Attewell was a \\"jigging\\" clown, known for his dancing; when Richard Tarlton had died in 1588, Attewell had taken over the job of dancing a jig at the end of each performance of the Queen Elizabeth's Men. John Singer, another clown with the Queen Elizabeth's company, also joined the Admiral's in 1594; other members included Edward Juby, Martin Slater, and Thomas Towne. The company's repertory came to feature plays by George Chapman, William Haughton, and Anthony Munday, among many other poets. The survival of Henslowe's so-called Diary (actually an account book kept by Henslowe and others in his organization) provides scholars with more detailed information about the Admiral's Men in this era than is available for any contemporaneous acting troupe. Among other points, the Diary illustrates the enormous demands the Elizabethan repertory system placed upon the actors. In the 1594-95 season, the Admiral's Men generally performed six days a week, and staged a total of 38 plays; 21 of these were new plays, introduced at a rate of approximately one every two weeks ‚Äì but only eight were acted again in subsequent seasons. The next season, 1595-96, demanded 37 plays, including 19 new ones; and the following year, 1596-97, 34 plays, 14 new. The company consistently played the works of Marlowe throughout this era. Tamburlaine Part 1 was acted 14 times in the 1594-95 season, followed by Doctor Faustus (12 performances), The Massacre at Paris (10), The Jew of Malta (9), and Tamburlaine Part 2 (6).Gurr, pp. 103‚Äì4. Taken altogether, the most popular play over this 1594-97 period was the anonymous The Wise Man of Westchester, which has not survived yet was acted 32 times over the three years, debuting on 3 December 1594 and last played on 18 July 1597. Earlier scholars speculated that it might be an alternative title for Anthony Munday's John a Kent and John a Cumber, though no firm evidence supports this idea.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 446. Henslowe had interests in other theatres, including the Fortune Theatre (built in 1600); the Admiral's Men moved into the new venue, and when the lease ran out on The Rose in 1605 it was abandoned. The company prospered, at least moderately, in its new location: in 1600 a share in the Admiral's Men (one out of a total of ten) was worth ¬£50, while in 1613 a share (one of twelve) was valued at ¬£70.Gurr, p. 68. Sometime in the winter of 1603-4, after the House of Stuart succeeded to the throne of England, the Admiral's Men acquired a new patron, Prince Henry (1594-1612), later the Prince of Wales (1610-12). Edward Alleyn retired from the stage in 1604, though he was involved with the company as their Fortune Theatre landlord. During this period their core cohort of players consisted of William Bird, Thomas Towne, Samuel Rowley, Charles Massey, Humphrey and Anthony Jeffes, Edward Juby, and Thomas Downton (who'd been part of the 1597 production of The Isle of Dogs). Edward Juby was the company's payee for Court performances, which suggests that he had significant responsibility for the troupe's finances. The company was known as Prince Henry's Men until the Henry's early death (6 November 1612), after which they came under the patronage of his new brother-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Their new patent of 11 January 1613 lists six of the actors of the previous decade, Juby, Bird, Rowley, Massey, Downton, and Humphrey Jeffes, plus six new sharers,Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 186‚Äì92. who included John Shank, later a long-time member of the King's Men, and Richard Gunnell, who would become a theatre manager and impresario by building the Salisbury Court Theatre with William Blagrave in 1629. Decline The company suffered a major set disaster when the Fortune Theatre burned down on 9 December 1621, destroying their stocks of playscripts and costumes. The owner, Edward Alleyn, rebuilt it in 1623, in brick, at a cost of ¬£1000. The actors moved back in, though recovery was difficult. They persisted for years, but endured a long-term decline in reputation. The company finally collapsed in 1631; after a re-organization, a troupe with some of the same personnel received royal patronage under the name of the infant Prince Charles, the future Charles II, and became the second iteration of Prince Charles's Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre. In December 1631 the Fortune Theatre, vacated by the Admiral's/Palsgrave's company, received the King's Revels Men from the Salisbury Court for the next few years (1631-33).Adams, p. 287. Repertory The Admiral's Men acted a huge repertory of plays during their long career; Henslowe's Diary lists dozens from the 1597-1603 period alone.

She has also made substantial contributions to other philosophical fields including political philosophy, the philosophy of law, and in ethics. She is currently a Distinguished Professor and the Abraham I. Melden Chair in Moral Philosophy at the University of California, Irvine. Life Gilbert was born in the United Kingdom and obtained a \\"double first\\" B.A. degree in Classics and Philosophy from Cambridge University and a B.Phil. and D.Phil. degree in Philosophy from Oxford University.Focusing on Rights: An Interview with Margaret Gilbert Retrieved 27 April 2018 From 1983 until 2006, she taught at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, where she was Professor of Philosophy. As of Fall 2006, she holds the Abraham I. Melden Chair in Moral Philosophy at the University of California, Irvine. She has been a visiting teacher and researcher at many academic institutions including Princeton University, the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of Pennsylvania, Indiana University, Wolfson College, Oxford, Technische Universit√§t Dresden, King's College London, and the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences, and regularly gives invited lectures in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. Gilbert was married to noted philosopher Saul Kripke and is the sister of famed British historian Sir Martin Gilbert. In 2016, Margaret Gilbert was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Works In her book On Social Facts (1989) Gilbert presented novel accounts of a number of central social phenomena in the context of critical reflections on proposals by the founders of sociology √âmile Durkheim, Georg Simmel, and Max Weber and others, including the philosopher David Lewis. The phenomena discussed include social conventions, social groups in a central sense of the term, group languages, collective belief, and acting together. Gilbert argued that these were all 'plural subject phenomena'. In a summary passage she writes, with allusion to Rousseau, that \\"One is willing to be the member of a plural subject if one is willing, at least in relation to certain conditions, to put one's own will into a 'pool of wills' dedicated, as one, to a single goal (or whatever it is that the pool is dedicated to)\\" (18). If two or more people have openly expressed such willingness in relation to a particular goal, in conditions of common knowledge, then the pertinent pool of wills is set up. In other words, the people concerned constitute the plural subject of the goal. As an alternative to talking of a pool of wills Gilbert refers also to joint commitment as when she writes: \\" the wills of the parties are jointly committed\\" (198). In later work she has preferred the language of joint commitment. Gilbert compares the plural subject to the singular subject and argues, with allusion to Durkheim, that \\"In order for individual human beings to form collectivities, they must take on a special character, a 'new' character, insofar as they need not, qua human beings, have that character. Moreover, humans must form a whole or unit of a special kind...a plural subject\\" (431). In subsequent writings Gilbert has continued the development and application of her plural subject theory. Each of the essay collections Living Together (1996), Sociality and Responsibility (2000) and Marcher Ensemble (in French) (2003) is composed of relevant papers authored by Gilbert. In her book A Theory of Political Obligation (2006; 2008) Gilbert offers a new perspective on a classical problem in political philosophy, generally known as 'the' problem of political obligation. As Gilbert makes clear in her book, there are many versions of this problem. She addresses the question whether there is something about one's being the member of a particular society that means one is obligated to uphold the political institutions of that society. Unlike most contemporary writers on the subject, she does not insist that the obligation in question is a matter of moral requirement. Gilbert argues that there are obligations of a different sort, and that these that are a function of membership in a political society construed as membership in a particular kind of plural subject constituted, as are all plural subjects, by a joint commitment. Other topics Gilbert has addressed in one or more of her publications include agreements and promises, authority, collective emotions, collective responsibility, personal decisions and intentions, marital love, mutual recognition, patriotism, rights (in particular claim-rights), shared attention, shared values, social rules, and social unity. Gilbert's essay collection Joint Commitment (2014) contains eighteen recent papers that together address most of the topics in the above list along with several others that Gilbert argues can be illuminated by an appeal to joint commitment. Gilbert's book Rights and Demands (2018) is the first extended treatment of demand-rights, a class of rights that, she argues, are apt to be considered rights par excellence. To have a demand-right is to have the standing to demand an action of someone. That person is, correspondingly, obligated to the right-holder to perform the act in question. Seeking to answer the question \\"How are demand rights possible?\\" Gilbert argues for two main theses. First, joint commitment is a ground of demand- rights. Second, joint commitment may well be their only ground. In this connection Gilbert asks whether there are demand-rights whose existence can be demonstrated by moral argument without invoking a joint commitment, and finds wanting existing arguments to the effect that there are. She also argues against the possibility of accruing demand-rights through the existence of a given legal system or other institution without the involvement of a joint commitment. The final chapter of the book applies its findings to the topic of human rights. In the course of Rights and Demands Gilbert engages with the work of central figures in contemporary rights theory such as H. L. A. Hart, Joseph Raz and Judith Thomson, and with prominent human rights theorists such as Charles Beitz and Alan Buchanan. She argues that promises and agreements--- both commonly understood to ground demand-rights---are constituted by joint commitments, rejecting promise theorists' standard assumption that the obligations most closely associated with promises are a matter of moral requirement. Gilbert's work has influenced a number of theorists outside philosophy including that of developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello.

This first strong pulse is called the pump pulse and starts a chemical reaction or leads to an increased population for energy levels other than the ground state within a sample of atoms or molecules. Typically the absorption of light by the sample is recorded within short time intervals (by a so-called test or probe pulses) to monitor relaxation or reaction processes initiated by the pump pulse. Flash photolysis was developed shortly after World War II as a result of the military's attempts to build cameras fast enough to photograph missiles in flight. The technique was developed in 1949 by Manfred Eigen, Ronald George Wreyford Norrish and George Porter, who won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this invention. Over the next 40 years the technique became more powerful and sophisticated due to developments in optics and lasers. Also, the interest in this method grew considerably as the practical applications expanded from chemistry to areas such as biology, materials science, and environmental sciences. Today, flash photolysis facilities are extensively used by researchers to study light-induced processes in organic molecules, polymers, nanoparticles, semiconductors, photosynthesis in plants, signaling, and light- induced conformational changes in biological systems.

The film stars Ewa Str√∂mberg as Linda Westinghouse, an American who works in a Turkish legal firm. Westinghouse has a series of erotic dreams that involve a mysterious vampire woman who seduces her before feeding on her blood. When she travels to an island to settle an inheritance, Linda recognizes a woman as the vampire from her dreams. The film was shot in 1970 in Turkey. It was a popular success in theaters in Europe on its release and was the first film to have a more psychedelic score for a Franco film and the first to have a lesbian theme as a prominent feature of the film. The film's score became popular in the mid-1990s when it was included on the compilation Vampyros Lesbos: Sexadelic Dance Party, an album that became a top ten hit on the British Alternative charts.  Plot  On a remote island, the beautiful vampire Countess Nadine Carody (Soledad Miranda) lures unwary victims with her seductive nightclub act and sets her sights on Linda (Ewa Str√∂mberg). Linda begins dreaming about Nadine and seeks her home on an island. She is interrupted by Memmet (Jes√∫s Franco) who warns her not to go to the island. Linda follows Memmet to his chamber where she walks in on him torturing a young woman. She escapes this encounter and proceeds to the island where Linda meets Nadine. The two go swimming and Nadine notes that the home they are staying at used to belong to Count Dracula. After Linda begins to feel dizzy from drinking wine, Nadine takes her to a room where the two have sex and Nadine draws blood from Linda's neck. Linda later finds Nadine motionless in a swimming pool and faints. The next day, Agra (Heidrun Kussin) appears in mental distress at a hospital, where she claims to have visions of Nadine. She is under the care of Dr. Seward (Dennis Price) who then treats his new patient, Linda, who does have any memory of what she encountered with Nadine. At Nadine's home, she appears alive and recounts to her servant Morpho (Jos√© Mart√≠nez Blanco) about how she became a vampire and her obsession with Linda who she wishes to become a vampire. Nadine uses her powers to contact Linda to return to her island where the two drink blood and have sex. On her return to hospital, Dr. Seward informs Linda that to remove herself from the vampire's curse she must split the vampire's head with an axe or pierce it with a pole. Linda is then kidnapped by Memmet, her boyfriend Omar (Andr√©s Monales) begins to search for her. Nadine later arrives at the asylum to have Linda return with her where she meets Dr. Seward. Dr. Seward admits that he only attempted to help Linda in order to draw Nadine to him so he can become a vampire. Nadine refuses and has Morpho kill him. As Omar searches for Linda, she is told by Memmet that all women, including his wife Arga, who return from the island become insane which has driven him to kill various women around the island. Linda manages to kill Memmet with a saw and escapes to find Nadine. She finds Nadine at her home near death in desperate need of blood to survive. Linda ignores Nadine's plea and bites her neck and stabs her with a pole through her left eye. Morpho commits suicide and Linda is found by Omar who tries to convince her that the whole experience was a dream.  Cast  Jes√∫s Franco (pictured) had an uncredited role in the film as Memmet. *Ewa Str√∂mberg as Linda Westinghouse (as Ewa Stroemberg) *Soledad Miranda as Countess Nadine Carody (as Susann Korda) *Andrea Montchal as Omar (as Viktor Feldmann) *Dennis Price as Dr. Alwin Seward *Paul M√ºller as Dr. Steiner *Heidrun Kussin as Agra *Michael Berling as Dr. Seward's assistant *Beni Cardoso as Dead woman (uncredited) *Jes√∫s Franco as Memmet (uncredited) *Jos√© Mart√≠nez Blanco as Morpho (uncredited) (as J. Martinez Blanco) Production Vampyros Lesbos was filmed in Turkey between June 1, 1970 and July 10, 1970. Franco applied film devices that were used in his previous film such as long strip club sequences and female protagonists while the lesbian subtext was more prominent in this film than any previous work. The music score also differs from the jazz soundtracks of his previous films with a more psychedelic music influenced soundtrack. The soundtrack was composed by Manfred H√ºbler, Siegfried Schwab and Jes√∫s Franco who credited himself under the alias of David Khune. The film went under several titles before being released as Vampyros Lesbos including 'Das Mal des Vampirs (Evil of the Vampires) and Im Zeichen der Vampire (Mark of the Vampire). Less than a month after finishing production on Vampyros Lesbos, Franco began working on his next film She Killed in Ecstasy (1971). Release Vampyros Lesbos was released in July 15, 1971 in Germany and in Spain in 1973 where it was a popular with audiences in Europe. The film was released on DVD by Synapse Video on January 4, 2000. Image Entertainment released the film on December 27, 2000 on DVD. A remake of Vampyros Lesbos directed by Matthew Saliba was released in 2008. The film follows the story of Franco's film. Reception Critics praised the film for its score made by Siegfried Schwab (pictured), Manfred H√ºbler and Jes√∫s Franco Total Film gave the film three stars out of five, noting that \\"Despite (or perhaps because of) the hilariously leaden acting, dull script and amateurish direction, this film still exerts a certain fascination.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader gave the film a negative review, comparing director Jes√∫s Franco to Ed Wood. The website Slant Magazine gave the film a positive review of three and half stars out of four, finding the film \\"effortlessly dreamlike\\" as well as praising the soundtrack. Film 4 gave the film a mixed review, noting that \\"you never come to Franco's films (over 150 of them) for the plots, but his dreamy, unsettling direction does develop the central tragedy of Carody's love for Westinghouse.\\" as well as praising the film's soundtrack. The Dissolve, an online magazine, gave the film a three out of five star rating, find that large portions of the film \\"lapse into tedium, whether they're extensive love scenes or, worse, the blatherings of serious men with \\"Dr.\\" before their names\\" as well as that the film \\"gave exploitation audiences something different, a mesmeric vibe\\" which originated from the film's score and the presence of Soledad Miranda. In his 2009 book The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: An Historical Survey, Bartomiej Paszylk took umbrage with some of the high-brow critics of the film, though ultimately acquiescing to its shortcomings, \\"Truth be told, Franco's vampyros are far more interested in being lesbos than in drinking human blood, but the movie is so mesmerizing and so outright sexy that you really shouldn't mind that. Soundtrack The soundtrack to Vampyros Lesbos was released as Vampyros Lesbos: Sexadelic Dance Party on compact disc in 1995 by Motel Records. The music on the album is compiled from the albums Psychedelic Dance Party and Sexadelic and consists of film music of three Franco films: Vampyros Lesbos, She Killed in Ecstasy and The Devil Came from Akasava. The album was released during a period where there was a resurgence of interest in Space age pop music, a style focused on easy listening music from the 1950s and 1960s. The track \\"The Lions and the Cucumber\\" from the album was later used again on the soundtrack of Jackie Brown by American director Quentin Tarantino. The album is dedicated to actress Soledad Miranda. The soundtrack was a top 10 hit on the British Alternative charts on its release over 20 years after the film was released. On September 29, 1997, a remix album titled The Spirit of Vampyros Lesbos was released. The album was a collection of remixes from various electronic artists including Two Lone Swordsmen, Cristian Vogel and Alec Empire who released their own mixes of the film's soundtrack. Allmusic gave the album a rating of three stars out of five referring to the album's music as \\"excruciating\\" as well noting that a track on the album is \\"built on a shameless ripoff of the \\"Satisfaction\\" guitar riff\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ rating, opining that it was \\"not for cheese lovers only.\\" =Track listing=  See also  * List of ghost films *List of horror films of 1971 *List of German films: 1970s *List of Spanish films of 1971 *Vampire film Notes References * *  External links   Category:1971 films Category:1971 horror films Category:1970s erotic films Category:1971 LGBT-related films Category:1995 soundtrack albums Category:1995 compilation albums Category:Dracula films Category:Films directed by Jes√∫s Franco Category:Films set in Istanbul Category:Films set in Turkey Category:Films shot in Turkey Category:German erotic films Category:German horror films Category:German-language films Category:German LGBT-related films Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:Spanish erotic films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish horror films Category:Spanish LGBT- related films Category:Vampires in film Category:West German films ","title":"Vampyros Lesbos"},{"id":"3032469","text":"Matthew McDonough (born 1969) is an American musician, songwriter, and producer.

The breed is descended from two stallions imported from Turkey to the US state of Virginia in the late 1800s. These stallions were then bred to ranch horses in Nebraska and Colorado, and in the early 1900s the two stallions who every registered Colorado Ranger traces to, Patches #1 and Max #2, were foaled. The breed was championed by rancher Mike Ruby, who founded the Colorado Ranger Horse Association in 1935. Original registry membership limits resulted in many Colorado Ranger horses being registered instead as Appaloosas, but pedigree research is ongoing to discover additional horses who trace their ancestry back to the original stallions. By 2005, more than 6,000 Colorado Ranger horses had been registered. Colorado Rangers may be any solid color or carry leopard spotting patterns. Pinto coloration and American Paint Horse breeding are not allowed, nor are draft horse and pony breeding. Colorado Ranger horses may be dual registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club, and approximately 90 percent are. Characteristics and registration Colorado Ranger horses may be of any color except pinto, and pinto or American Paint Horse breeding is not allowed within five generations of any registered horse's pedigree. They stand high. The breed has a straight facial profile, long, muscular neck and deep chest. The shoulders and croup are sloping, connected by a short back. Colorado Ranger horses are still used for their original purpose as ranch horses. They are also shown, both in Western and English disciplines, although mainly the former, and used for trail and pleasure riding. They are known for their athleticism, good disposition and abilities as stock horses. All registered Colorado Ranger Horses trace directly to one of two foundation sires in their pedigree. The first is Patches #1 and the second is Max #2, a son of another horse named Max born in 1918. Registered Colorado Rangerbreds may be bred to registered Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, Appaloosas, Arabians and AraAppaloosas, and the resulting progeny registered as purebred Colorado Rangerbreds. Horses with draft horse or pony blood may not be registered. Colorado Ranger Horses may be double-registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club, but Appaloosas may not be registered with the CRHA unless they have the proper bloodlines. Approximately 90 percent of Colorado Ranger horses are dual-registered. History The original foundation ancestors of the Colorado Ranger were two stallions brought to the United States and given to US president Ulysses S. Grant by the Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1878. The first horse was a gray Barb named Linden Tree, foaled in 1874. The second was a desertbred Arabian, also gray, named Leopard, foaled in 1873. The two stallions reached Virginia in 1879, after their voyage from Turkey. Upon reaching Virginia, they spent 14 years in the breeding herds of Randolph Huntington, a noted breeder of trotting and roadster horses. In 1896, Randolph leased Leopard and Linden Tree to a friend of Grant's, named General Colby, who used the stallions to breed a number of mares on his ranch in Nebraska. These breedings were successful at producing high-quality ranch horses, and a few years later several ranches in Colorado collaborated to buy a group of horses, including one stallion, from the Colby Ranch. All of the mares were sired by one of the two imported sires, and the stallion, a few-spot leopard Appaloosa, was a grandson of Leopard on both sides of his pedigree. The influence of Linden Tree and Leopard on American horse breeding was such that they are now listed in the studbooks for the Arabian Horse Association and the Jockey Club (which registers Thoroughbreds), both major breed associations in the United States. =20th century= An Appaloosa, displaying the characteristic spotted pattern often seen among Colorado Rangers The Colorado ranchers used the horses purchased from Colby to improve their existing ranch stock, and the progeny of these crossings became the Colorado Ranger Horse. Although leopard coloration was not originally an aim of the breeding program, many of the resulting horses bore spotted coat patterns, and breeders began to include the patterning as one of their goals. Two other stallions also became influential foundation sires of the breed. One was a Colorado-born leopard-spot colt named Max, foaled in 1918. The second was a Barb stallion named Spotte, imported from North Africa in 1918 by the owner of the W.R. Thompson Cattle Company as a wedding gift for his daughter. This stallion provided another important infusion of Barb blood, which had been diluted in the breed since Linden Tree had been imported from Turkey. Mike Ruby, a horseman from the Colorado High Plains, became interested in the breed and acquired Max and Patches, a son of the original Colby Ranch stallion. During his time breeding Colorado Ranger horses, he kept complete records of every horse that he bred, which became the initial pedigree record for the breed association. Ruby was invited to bring two stallions to the Denver Stock Show in 1934, and chose to take Leopard #3 and Fox #10. The names Colorado Rangers and Colorado Rangerbreds were coined during this show by members of the now-Colorado State University faculty, in reference to the horses having been bred on the ranges of Colorado. Although \\"Colorado Ranger\\" is the official name of the breed, the nickname of \\"Rangerbreds\\" is still commonly used. Ruby was influential in saving some of the highest-quality Ranger stock during the severe drought of the 1930s, by driving them over to better pasture in a history-making journey. When the rains returned to eastern Colorado, he again made the drive to return the horses to their original pasture. After re-establishing his herd, Ruby developed a practice of leasing groups of his Rangerbred horses to other ranchers throughout the western United States for use as breeding stock. Through this practice, Colorado Ranger horses influenced, and were in return influenced by, the Quarter Horse, Appaloosa and other western stock horse breeds. In 1935, Ruby founded the Colorado Ranger Horse Association (CRHA), and was granted a corporate charter for the association in 1938. Ruby remained president of the organization from 1935 until his death in 1942. The registry initially imposed a 50-member limit, and many Ranger horses, whose breeders were not allowed to become members, were instead registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club. The member limit was lifted in 1964, and since then pedigree research has continued to find and register horses with Ranger breeding that are un-registered or registered as Appaloosas. During the 1980s, some Lusitano blood was allowed into the breed, but this practice has been discontinued. The CRHA states that up to 1 in 8 registered Appaloosas may have Colorado Ranger blood, and as such be eligible for registry with the CRHA. As of 2005, there were more than 6,000 horses registered with the CRHA, with between 100 and 125 new horses registered annually. While originally bred in the western US, today many Colorado Rangers are found in the midwest and eastern parts of the country, including the states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They are also found in Canada, where there is at least one large breeding farm.

Adding to Duchamp‚Äôs audacious move, Levine turns his gesture back into an ‚Äúart object‚Äù by elevating its materiality and finish. As a feminist artist, Levine states that she remakes works specifically by male artists who she claims commandeered patriarchal dominance in art history. Sherrie Levine (born 1947) is an American photographer, painter, and conceptual artist. Some of her work consists of exact photographic reproductions of the work of other photographers such as Walker Evans, Eliot Porter and Edward Weston.  Early life and education  Sherrie Levine was born in Hazleton, Pennsylvania in 1947. The Midwest, however, shaped her identity, as she spent most of her childhood and adolescence in the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri. Levine recalled her mother‚Äîwho enjoyed painting‚Äîsparking her interest in art at eight years old, as she would take Levine to the St. Louis Art Museum. Levine's mother would also take her to see art house films on a regular basis, which later influenced her work. After graduating high school in 1965, she spent eight years in Wisconsin, received her B.A. from the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1969.\\"Sherrie Levine\\" , Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Retrieved 17 November 2014. In 1973, she earned her M.F.A. from the same institution. After working odd jobs in commercial art and teaching, Levine then moved to New York City in 1975 to pursue her art career. Work = Artworks = Much of Levine's work is explicitly appropriated from recognizable modernist artworks by artists such as Walker Evans, Edgar Degas, Marcel Duchamp, and Constantin Brancusi. Appropriation art gained notoriety in the late 1970s, although it can be traced to early modernist works, specifically those using collage. Other appropriation artists such as Louise Lawler, Vikky Alexander, Barbara Kruger, and Mike Bidlo came into prominence in New York‚Äôs East Village in the 1980s. The importance of appropriation art in contemporary culture lies in its ability to fuse broad cultural images as a whole and direct them towards narrower contexts of interpretation. In 1977, Levine participated in the exhibition Pictures at Artists Space in New York, curated by Douglas Crimp.Fowle, Kate. \\"The Pictures Generation\\" , Frieze Magazine, Retrieved 17 November 2014. Other artists in the exhibition included Robert Longo, Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, and Philip Smith. Crimp's term, \\"Pictures Generation,\\" was later used to describe the generation of artists in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were moving away from minimalism and towards picture-making. Levine is best known for her series of photographs, After Walker Evans, which was shown at her 1981 solo exhibition at Metro Pictures Gallery in New York.Pollack, Maika. \\"Will the Real Sherrie Levine Please Stand Up?, The Observer, Retrieved 17 November 2014. The works consist of well-known Walker Evans photographs, rephotographed by Levine from an Evans exhibition catalogue and then presented as Levine's own artwork without manipulation of the images. The Evans photographs ‚Äî made famous by his book project Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, with writings by James Agee ‚Äî are widely considered to be the quintessential photographic record of rural American poor during the Great Depression.Downes, Lawrence. \\"Of Poor Farmers and Famous Men\\", The New York Times, Retrieved 17 November 2014.

All of it is now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.Dan Duray (March 3, 2016), Is now the time for Sherrie Levine‚Äôs market to take off? The Art Newspaper. Levine's appropriation of Evans's images has since become a hallmark of the postmodern movement.\\"After Walker Evans: Sheer Levine\\", The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Retrieved 17 November 2014. By rephotographing and re-feminizing this series, Levine makes the images more transparent in their message, rather than focusing on authorship. Including herself in this series can be seen as the artist's gesture of solidarity with the subject. Levine has rephotographed a number of works by other artists, including Eliot Porter and Edward Weston. Additional examples of Levine's works include photographs of Van Gogh paintings from a book of his work; watercolor paintings based directly on work by Fernand L√©ger; pieces of plywood with their knotholes painted bright solid colors; and her 1991 sculpture Fountain, a bronze urinal modeled after Marcel Duchamp's 1917 work, Fountain. This work in particular brings attention to the idea of originality and Levine's ability to remake artworks as not quite themselves. In the case of Fountain, Levine purposefully chooses a polished bronze finish to evoke works by Brancusi. By doing so, Levine likens the two artists' works, and raises the question of originality and the copy. In 1993, Levine created cast glass copies of sculptures by Constantin Brancusi, held in the permanent collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, for an exhibition titled Museum Studies.\\"Museum Studies\\", Philadelphia Museum of Art, Retrieved 23 November 2014. In 2009, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held an exhibition titled The Pictures Generation, which featured Levine's works.\\"The Pictures Generation\\", Retrieved 17 November 2014.

Sherrie Levine: Mayhem, mounted at the Whitney Museum of Art from November 2011 through January 2012, was a meticulously organized installation, ranging from Levine's best-known photographs to works including her more recent Crystal Skull series (2010). During the winter of 2016, Levine exhibited new work of monochrome paintings paired with refrigerators. In 2016-2017 she exhibited at Neues Museum N√ºrnberg: After All. In 2010, the artist created a series of eighteen monochromes titled \\"Gray and Blue Monochromes\\" based on Alfred Stieglitz's Equivalents (a series of abstract photographs of the sky). = Feminism = Levine's art is most often associated with 1980's theoretical feminism. She was showcased in the exhibit Difference: On Representation and Sexuality in 1984 along with artists such as Barbara Kruger, Jeff Wall, and Mary Kelly. This exhibit focused on gender distortions rather than differences, and the construct of sexuality. Three paintings from Levine's series After Ernst Ludwig Kirchner were included in this exhibit. Her appropriations of male artists' famous works combined with her intentional re-feminizing brings attention to the \\"difference problem\\" which this exhibit was focused on.

The team debuted on the September 5, 2005 episode of Raw and in their time together held the World Tag Team Championship on three occasions. The team was briefly broken up in 2006, but was later reunited. During the 2008 WWE Draft, Murdoch was moved to the SmackDown brand, separating the two. Shortly after being drafted, he was released from the company. Later the same year, Cade was released as well, and the team reunited again on the independent circuit. Career =World Wrestling Entertainment (2005-2008)= Formation In August 2005, both Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch were promoted from World Wrestling Entertainment's developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling, to the main Raw roster and wrestled dark matches under the team name \\"TNT\\". On the August 22, 2005 episode of Raw, a vignette was shown showcasing the new tag team of \\"Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch\\". The men were shown in a bar setting, portraying redneck characters; Cade a smooth-talking cowboy, and Murdoch an angry, Southern trucker.view They defeated the reigning World Tag Team Champions, the Hurricane and Rosey, in a non-title match in their televised in-ring debut on the September 5, 2005 episode of Raw, making them the number one contenders for the championship. They took the championship for the first time at the Unforgiven pay-per-view after Murdoch delivered an elevated DDT to the Hurricane outside of the ring causing him to suffer a kayfabe stinger. They held the title for six weeks, when they dropped them to Big Show and Kane at November's Taboo Tuesday event. Split Lance Cade (left) and Trevor Murdoch Cade and Murdoch wrestled their final match as a tag team on the November 13, (aired November 18) 2005 Eddie Guerrero tribute show, where they lost an \\"inter-promotional\\" match against SmackDown!'s Legion of Doom (Road Warrior Animal and Heidenreich). Two weeks later, on the November 28 Raw, Joey Styles announced that they were no longer a team. In a segment of Unlimited, Raw's online commercial-filling segment, Murdoch explained that he had shifted focus to the Intercontinental Championship. After the split, Murdoch received a small push and became the Unlimited \\"movie critic\\", view while Cade debuted a new \\"Refined Southern Gentleman\\" gimmick. Although the team had split up, they were still shown to be \\"allies\\" and were often seen together during backstage segments. Separately, they were often put into singles matches with members of other tag teams, and even though they were no longer together they would aid each other in their matches. They were also put into a feud with the team of Goldust and Gene Snitsky. Reunited On the April 14, 2006 episode of Heat, Cade and Murdoch were once again announced as a tag team. They wrestled together again for the first time on the May 19 Heat in a win over Charlie Haas and Viscera.view During the next few months, the team was given a number of wins on Heat and appeared on Unlimited to cut promos stating their intentions to win back the Tag Team title. Later in the year, the two began appearing as \\"hired guns\\" for various superstars, including The McMahons (Vince and Shane) and Edge, mostly against D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels). During the April 2, 2007 episode of Raw, Cade and Murdoch were put into a tag team battle royal for the World Tag Team Championship, which eventually went to the Hardys (Matt and Jeff). After the loss the two teams began a feud over the title, with the Hardy's retaining at the Backlash, after which Cade and Murdoch started a gimmick of being supreme sportsmen. They lavished the Hardys with compliments, calling them the \\"better men,\\" when they performed guest commentary during their matches and started wrestling in an overly clean fashion. They also began showing respect to all opponents; shaking hands before and after matches, when before they wouldn't have bothered, though commentators doubted their sincerity. On the June 4 Raw they took the Championship from the Hardy's. The title change featured a measure of storyline controversy, as during the pin Jeff Hardy's foot was on the bottom rope‚Äîwhich should have caused a rope break, but Murdoch pushed it off before the referee saw it, allowing the pin to continue. After the match, when the Hardys confronted Cade and Murdoch about it, both men pleaded ignorance before attacking the Hardys. Cade (left) and Murdoch at an NWA Championship Wrestling show After becoming champions again they were put into a feud with Cryme Tyme (JTG and Shad Gaspard) involving Cryme Tyme stealing their belongings and auctioning them to the crowd, but the storyline ended abruptly when Cryme Tyme was released from the company. Instead the sportsman gimmick was revived for a feud with Paul London and Brian Kendrick, who took the World Tag Team Championship at a house show on September 5, 2007 in South Africa, only to drop them right back to Cade and Murdoch on September 8. They remained champions until the December 10 episode of Raw, when Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes took the title. In April 2008, Cade began expressing frustration after a series of losses. Following a loss on the April 28 Raw, Murdoch sang a rendition of \\"Friends in Low Places\\". The next week he sang in a backstage vignette, and after a victory on May 12 sang the chorus of \\"The Gambler\\" at Cade's behest, only to have Cade strike him and break up the team. The two faced off on June 2, with Cade getting the victory. In the 2008 WWE Draft Murdoch was moved to the SmackDown brand, though he was released just days later, while Cade continued to wrestle on Raw until he was released from his WWE contract on October 14, 2008. =Independent circuit (2008‚Äì2009)= Less than a week later, Cade began accepting bookings with Murdoch on the independent circuit, for such promotions as IWA-Mid South. Murdoch and Cade also began wrestling for NWA and have appeared on the NWA showcase TV program before Cade went to wrestle in Japan and Murdoch went to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and wrestled as Jethro Holliday.

Suspicious of Dellasandro, the two form an uneasy alliance as Dellasandro sets out to recruit the ego-centric TV host Eric Carney into his scheme, until seasoned mercenary Mitch Vendieks warns Dellasandro that Carney is planning a kidnap plot of his own. Determined to beat Carney to the punch, Dellasandro and Danny join forces with Mitch to form their own team, recruiting the inept Sean Knight, mendacious getaway driver Dave Phibbs and cynical intelligence ace Rupert Wingate, who soon discovers that Skase is devising a deadly scheme to resurrect his business empire across Europe. With time running out, Dellasandro and the boys head for Majorca and track Skase to his sprawling mansion, confronting the devious businessman. The team is outnumbered by Skase's Security Guards and thus cannot manage to kidnap him.

He eventually became the principal owner of the Wood-Sullivan Hardware Company and was an investor in several mining ventures. While living in Goldfield he served on the town board, as president of the local chamber of commerce, and as president of the local volunteer fire department. In 1914 he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Nevada and served from 1915 to 1927. During World War I he was adjutant general of the Nevada National Guard, as well as Nevada's federal disbursing officer and director of the draft. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1923 and commenced practice in Carson City. In 1938 Sullivan was again elected Lieutenant Governor, and he served from 1939 to 1942. In 1942 Sullivan was elected to the 78th Congress, and he served one term, January 3, 1943 to January 3, 1945. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1944. After leaving Congress Sullivan resumed practicing law in Reno. Sullivan died in Reno on August 9, 1953. He was buried in Reno's Our Mother of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) Cemetery.

Life and work Anderson worked on Xitintoday, a studio album released by former Hawkwind member Nik Turner's project Sphynx in 1978, which was produced by Steve Hillage. He then joined Hillage's band and appeared on his two 1979 albums, Live Herald and Open. After a few years as a session musician, he had a brief stint in Hawkwind in 1983, but did not record with them. His tenure in that band was cut short when he played with the Glove on their first and only album Blue Sunshine. This led to him joining the Cure later that year, when original drummer Lol Tolhurst moved to keyboards. Anderson recorded on the albums Japanese Whispers, The Top, and Concert in addition to the singles \\"Love Cats\\" and \\"The Caterpillar\\". He is credited on recordings by many other bands and artists, including (in order of release) Techno Twins, M/Robin Scott, Jimmy Pursey, Mother Gong, Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Steve Vengeance, Two-Bit Thief, The Saints, Backbeats, Martha Munizzi, Group 1 Crew, the Gun Club, Spirits Burning & Clearlight, and Beat the System (as a producer). He also collaborated with many other artists including Brilliant, the Edgar Broughton Band, the Burning Sensations, Circus Hazzard, Edwyn Collins, the Cureheads, Hooky Dallion, Jason Donovan, Peter Gabriel, Mick Hawksworth and Friends, Isaac Hayes, Iggy Pop, The Last Poets, Lol Tolhurst's Levinhurst, Glenn Matlock, Steve New, Nik Turner's Inner City Unit, Mike Oldfield, David Michael Phillips, Jimmy Somerville, Midge Ure, Jenn Vix, Harry Williamson and Friends, Youth, and Zeke Manyika's Dr. Love. As well as being a session musician, Anderson was a producer of television commercials and worked for record companies and charities. He posted newly recorded solo tracks on YouTube as Front & Centre. Anderson was diagnosed with terminal cancer in February 2019 and died on 26 February 2019, aged 68.

The ship was laid down in December 1936 and launched in January 1939, but the outbreak of World War II slowed her construction and fitting-out work was finally stopped in the summer of 1940 when she was approximately 95 percent complete. The unfinished ship remained pier-side in the shipyard until March 1942, when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants. Seydlitz was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers. Renamed Weser, the ship was to have had a complement of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 divebombers. Work was not completed, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to K√∂nigsberg where she was eventually scuttled. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sistership for the Soviet Navy. This plan was also abandoned, and the ship was broken up for scrap.  Design  Recognition drawing of an Admiral Hipper-class cruiser The of heavy cruisers was ordered in the context of German naval rearmament after the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 and repudiated the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1935, Germany signed the Anglo‚ÄìGerman Naval Agreement with Great Britain, which provided a legal basis for German naval rearmament; the treaty specified that Germany would be able to build five \\"treaty cruisers\\". The Admiral Hippers were nominally within the 10,000-ton limit, though they significantly exceeded the figure. Seydlitz was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of . Seydlitz was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines, which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired boilers. The ship's top speed was , at . As designed, her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men. Seydlitzs primary armament was eight SK L/60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets, placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Her anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve L/65 guns, twelve guns, and eight guns. The ship also carried a pair of triple torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure. The ship was equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult. Seydlitzs armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick while the main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 70 mm thick sides.  Construction and conversion  Seydlitz in May 1942, before conversion work began Seydlitz was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the Deschimag shipyard in Bremen. Seydlitz was originally designed as a light cruiser version of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers, armed with twelve guns instead of the Admiral Hippers eight guns. The Kriegsmarine decided, however, to complete the ship identically to Admiral Hipper on 14 November 1936. Her keel was laid on 29 December 1936, under construction number 940. The ship was launched on 19 January 1939, but after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, work was halted when the ship was approximately 95 percent complete. Following the loss of the battleship in May 1941, during which British aircraft carriers proved instrumental, and the near torpedoing of her sistership in March 1942, the Kriegsmarine became convinced of the necessity of acquiring aircraft carriers. Work on the purpose-built carrier , which had been halted in April 1940, was resumed in March 1942. The Kriegsmarine also decided to convert a number of vessels into auxiliary aircraft carriers. Seydlitz was among the ships selected for conversion, along with several passenger liners. At the same time as construction of Graf Zeppelin resumed, conversion work began on Seydlitz. The majority of the superstructure was cut away, with the exception of the funnel, to prepare for the installation of a flight deck and an aircraft hangar. In total, approximately of material from the ship was removed. The flight deck was to have been long and wide. The hangar was long and wide forward and wide amidships and aft. Her armament was reduced to an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5 cm L/65 guns in twin mounts, two forward of the conning tower and three aft, ten 3.7 cm guns in dual mounts, and twenty- four 2 cm guns in quadruple mounts. Seydlitzs air complement was to have consisted of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 Stuka divebombers. The Bf 109 fighters were a navalized version of the \\"E\\" model, designated as Bf 109T. Their wings were longer than the land-based model to allow for shorter take- off. The Ju 87 type selected was to have been the \\"E\\" variant, which was a navalized version of the Ju 87D, and were modified for catapult launches and were equipped with arresting gear. The ship was renamed Weser, but work was ceased in June 1943, before the conversion was completed. The unfinished vessel was then transferred to K√∂nigsberg, where she remained for the rest of the war. On 29 January 1945, the ship was scuttled before the advancing Soviet Red Army could seize her. The Soviet Navy nevertheless considered using the wreck for parts to complete the cruiser , a sister-ship of Seydlitz the Soviets had purchased unfinished before the outbreak of war. This was not carried out, however, and the ship was broken up for scrap.

It was discovered on 14 January 1905, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after the title character of Bellini's opera Norma.  Classification and orbit  Norma is a background asteroid, located near the region occupied by the Themis family, a prominent family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.7 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,078 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in March 1911, more than six years after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  = Spectral type = In the SMASS classification, Norma is a B-type asteroid. These types of asteroids have a featureless surface that displays magnesium-rich silicates, which likely accounts for the relatively high albedo as an outer-belt asteroid. Norma surface consists of more than 50% amorphous magnesium pyroxenes based on data collected with the Subaru Telescope. = Photometry = In April 2007, a first rotational lightcurve of Norma was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 30.6 hours with a brightness variation of 0.2 magnitude (). However more recent observations by two American astronomers have since superseded this result. In December 2011, Robert Stephens at the Santana Observatory obtained a lightcurve that gave a period 19.55 hours and a brightness amplitude of 0.06 magnitude (), while Frederick Pilcher measured a period of 19.508 hours with an amplitude of 0.25 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in November 2016. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Norma measures between 27.89 and 40.11 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of between 0.063 and 0.119. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) agrees with IRAS, and derives an albedo of 0.0528 and a diameter of 40.02 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.8. CALL also assumes Norma to be a C-type asteroid (rather than a B-type) due to its derived low albedo and the general spectral type of the Themis family.  Naming  This minor planet was named for the principal female character of the opera Norma by Italian composer Vincenzo Bellini (1801‚Äì1835). In the opera, Norma is a high priestess of the Druids. In 1955, the official naming citation was published by Paul Herget in The Names of the Minor Planets ()  References   External links  * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR ‚Äì Observatoire de Gen√®ve, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) ‚Äì Minor Planet Center * * 000555 Category:Discoveries by Max Wolf Category:Minor planets named from literature Category:Minor planets named for opera characters Category:Named minor planets 000555 19050114 ","title":"555 Norma"},{"id":"3032625","text":"Morgantown is a census-designated placehttps://www.census.gov/2010census/ in Caernarvon Township, located in southern Berks County, Pennsylvania as well as partially in Caernarvon Township in Lancaster County. As of the 2010 census, the population was 826 residents.https://www.census.gov/# History Morgantown was named after Colonel Jacob Morgan, who laid out the town around 1770. His father, Thomas Morgan, had been a native of Wales, a captain in the French and Indian War, and owner of a large tract of choice land in Caernarvon Township. Jacob Morgan settled in this area around 1765, building a large stone house, which still stands on Hartz Road between Mineview Drive and Shiloh Road. It is rumored to have housed George Washington during a brief overnight visit. The house has been restored by its owners. Morgantown was, until the arrival of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a mostly agriculture-based settlement. Now it is much larger and busier with the settlement of several manufacturing companies, including Timet, Morgan Corp. Stoltzfus Spreaders, Viwinco Windows and McNeilus cement mixers. Other aspects of the town have grown too, especially the roads. In the 1970s the Morgantown Expressway Interstate 176 was built to interstate highway standards, providing a link between Morgantown and PA 23 and Reading and US 422. Conestoga Christian School and High Point Baptist Academy are based in the area. Also, although not actually in Morgantown but part of its neighboring town, Elverson, Twin Valley High School overlooks parts of Morgantown and is where most of the town's children attend school. In 1987, an entrepreneur named Raymond Carr laid out plans for New Morgan which was incorporated into a borough in 1988. The borough currently has 35 residents, and the actual town has yet to be built. Geography Morgantown is drained by the Conestoga River, which flows westward into the Susquehanna River. The confluence of multiple sources occurs in the CDP. It has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) and is in hardiness zone 6b. Average monthly temperatures range from 29.6¬∞ F in January to 73.8¬∞ F in July. Economy Morgantown has a small public airport east of the center of town. Morgantown Center is an event facility along the Pennsylvania Turnpike which houses \\"Classic Auto Mall\\" a large classic car consignment house.

In May 1992 he began his term as president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), one of the twelve public universities composing the Maryland university system. Hrabowski has been credited with transforming an undistinguished commuter college into an institution noted for research and innovation. Under his leadership, UMBC has been ranked the #1 Up and Coming University in the US for six consecutive years (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014) by U.S. News and World Report magazine. Hrabowski is the co-author of the books, Beating the Odds: Raising Academically Successful African American Males (1998), Overcoming the Odds: Raising Academically Successful African American Young Women (2001), and Holding Fast to Dreams: Empowering Youth from the Civil Rights Crusade to STEM (2015). His research and many publications focus on science and math education, with a special emphasis on minority participation and performance. His leadership, expertise and vision are integral to programs worldwide in science/technology/engineering/mathematics (STEM), and are used by universities, school systems, and community groups around the country. Hrabowski chaired the prestigious National Academies committee that produced the report Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America's Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads. In 2012, President Barack Obama appointed Hrabowski to Chair of the newly created President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans,President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts, Yumanewsnow.com. and he was also a candidate for Secretary of Education in his administration. He has been called one of America's Best Leaders, one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World, and one of America's 10 Best College Presidents. In 2011, Hrabowski received the Carnegie Corporation of New York's Academic Leadership Award, one of the highest honors given to an educator. The award included a $500,000 grant, which he has directed to support and promote a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and student success at UMBC.2011 Carnegie Awards Early life and education Hrabowski was born in segregated Birmingham, Alabama, the only child of his parents, both of whom were educators. His mother was an English teacher who decided to become a math teacher, and she used the young Hrabowski as a guinea pig at home. His father had been a math teacher and then went to work at a steel mill because, as Hrabowski is quoted as saying, \\"frankly, he could make more money doing that.\\" Frequently asked about the origin of his unusual surname, Hrabowski explains that he is the great-great- grandson of Eaton Hrabowski, a slave owned by and named for slave owner Samuel Hrabowski. In a CBS television interview, Hrabowski recounted that he is the third Freeman Hrabowski; his grandfather was the first Freeman Hrabowski born a free man, as opposed to having to be freed. When he was 12 years old, in 1963, Hrabowski saw his friends readying for the Children's Crusade march for civil rights. He convinced his parents to let him join in as a youth advocate, but soon into the march he was swept up in a mass arrest. Birmingham's notorious Public Safety Commissioner Eugene \\"Bull\\" Connor spat in his face and arrested him. The jail guards locked even the youngest freedom marchers in with hardened criminals. Hrabowski spent five terrified days and nights shielding other youngsters and comforting them by reading his Bible aloud or singing songs. After being reunited with the adults, Hrabowski remembers Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. telling them, \\"What you do this day will have an impact on generations as yet unborn.\\" King's words resonated with Hrabowski, and ultimately rang true as the national outrage at the brutality against Birmingham children helped build the pressure for laws banning racial discrimination. That outcome gave Hrabowski a life mission, and he has since been a staunch and tireless campaigner for equality, education, and excellence. When he was 19 years old, Hrabowski graduated from Hampton Institute with high honors in mathematics. During his matriculation there he spent a year abroad at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he received his M.A. in mathematics and four years later his Ph.D. in higher education administration and statistics. Hrabowski focused his education on math and science in part because he was worried that the American economy would suffer if other countries continued to graduate more technology experts than the United States. He wants to ensure smart, dynamic students of all backgrounds continue to be amongst the graduates from STEM programs. Career at UMBC UMBC was a relatively young school in a Baltimore suburb when Hrabowski arrived in 1987 as Vice Provost, then Executive Vice President, and President in 1992. Over two decades as president of UMBC, Hrabowski gained a high public profile.Childs Walker, Freeman Hrabowski's UMBC legacy grows as he celebrates 20 years as president, Baltimore Sun (September 1, 2012). Hrabowski emphasized STEM education, and co-founded the Meyerhoff Scholars, aimed at promoting minority achievement in STEM fields. Under his leadership, \\"more black students earn bachelor's degrees in science and technology from UMBC than from any other non-historically black university in Maryland, even College Park, which has three times as many students.\\" Hrabowski was an advisor to President Barack Obama on higher education policy, and was appointed by Obama to serve as chair of an advisory council on excellence in African-American education. He received an honorary doctorate from Harvard University in 2010.

He is one of four brothers who were all drafted to Australian Football League clubs, alongside Damian, RyanRyan and Adam on opposing teams in 2002 and Josh, from Wahgunyah on the Murray River, in northern Victoria. Career =Geelong: 1995-2001= Houlihan made his debut in Round 4, 1997 with the Geelong Football Club against Essendon. He wore the number 3 guernsey. He was drafted as a compensatory selection (second overall) in the 1995 pre-season draft from the Murray Bushrangers at the age of 16. He actually started out as a jockey but a growth spurt put an end to that and he turned his attention to Australian rules football, playing senior football for Corowa-Rutherglen at sixteen. Houlihan made a name for himself as a talented half forward, kicking five goals in several games. He managed 14 games in his debut season but just one the following year after a series of injuries. He played two games early in 1999, having little impact. He returned to play all the final eight games and established himself in 2000, playing 22 of 23 games and a top 10 best and fairest finish. But after playing 12 of the first 13 games in 2001, his form fell away, playing just two more games and he was then delisted. =Richmond: 2002-2004= Houlihan was drafted by Richmond and resumed his career there in 2002, wearing the number 44 guernsey. He played the first 12 games in 2002, including a three-goal effort in Round 11 but only managed one further game, spending most of the remainder of the season in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He played 16 games in 2003, including four and five goal efforts. A hamstring injury kept him out for most of 2004, returning late in the season for four games but incoming coach Terry Wallace decided Houlihan did not fit in with his plans. =Post-AFL career= Houlihan continued to play with Richmond's VFL affiliate Coburg in 2005. At 26 years of age, Houlihan decided that his career was already over and he ruled out playing AFL football again. He instead returned to his earlier interest in horse racing, hosting a horse-racing tips show with Brett Phillips and Nick Evans on radio station SEN 1116 and training jockeys in diet and fitness. In 2007 he chose to take some great advise from mentor and now business partner Bruce Armstrong and start his own promotional merchandise business called CorpEdge Marketing.

It was discovered in 1906, by astronomer August Kopff at Heidelberg Observatory, and later named for the independent country of Croatia, then part of Austria- Hungary.  Discovery  The asteroid was discovered on 3 March 1906, by German astronomer August Kopff at the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany, with the use of the photographic method. In the moment of the discovery, the asteroid was 12.5mv and was in the constellation of Virgo. The discovery was published in the Astronomische Nachrichten magazine, in the article wrote by Professor Wolf. Later, some astronomers (Johann Palisa, Karl Lohnert and some others) were making measurements for the purpose of determining the orbital elements. From these measurements P. V. Neugebauer from Berlin and M.S. Mello and Simas from Trafaria (Lisbon) had independently determined the first orbital elements. Observations had continued, and among observers there were A. Kopff, E. Bianchi, A. Abetti, G. Zappa, P. Chafardet, E. Millosevich, J. Palisa, and some others. Observations were made from Berlin, Copenhagen, Rome, Arcetra and some other Italian cities.  Orbit and classification  Croatia is the parent body of the Croatia family (), a small asteroid family of less than 100 known members. It orbits the Sun in the outer main belt at a distance of 3.0‚Äì3.3 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,032 days; semi-major axis of 3.14 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 11¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, sixteen days after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Croatia is ambiguous, closest to a carbonaceous C-type and somewhat similar to that of an X-type asteroid, while the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) characterized it as a primitive P-type asteroid. Nesvorn√Ω determined the overall spectral type for the Croatia family to be that of an X-type. = Rotation period = In July 2013, the so-far best-rated rotational lightcurve of Croatia was obtained by astronomers Romain Montaigut, Arnaud Leroy, Raoul Behrend, Ren√© Roy, Donn Starkey, Maurice Audejean, Roberto Crippa and Federico Manzini. Lightcurve analysis gave a longer-than average rotation period of 24.821 hours with a brightness variation of 0.25 magnitude (). The result supersedes photometric observations by Brian Warner and by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory, which measured a shorter period of 11.7 and 16.385 hours with an amplitude of 0.16 and 0.32, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Croatia measures between 84.44 and 96.491 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.041 and 0.06. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0577 and a diameter of 87.66 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.0. The radius of (probably) 28.452 km (and, consequently, the superficial area of 2543.2 km2, and equatorial circumference of 89.385 km) were determined by use of Argelander's Method.  Naming  This minor planet was named for the country of Croatia, then part of Austria-Hungary, after the suggestion made by astronomer Max Wolf. It also honors the foundation of the Astronomical Observatory of the Croatian Natural Sciences Society (Zagreb Observatory) in Zagreb.

News media throughout Australia covered the crime and subsequent trial, which later became the subject of a book and a television film. Double murder On 4 April 2002, the victims, Margaret Wales-King and her second husband, Paul King, attended the Glen Iris home of Wales-King's youngest son Matthew Wales, a former hairdresser, and his Chilean-born wife Maritza Wales for dinner. That evening, Wales made, then drugged, their vegetable soup with crushed tablets stolen from his mother to make them drowsy. He then killed his mother and stepfather as they left the house by clubbing them to the back of the neck. After hiding the bodies in the front yard he then abandoned their car in Middle Park. After renting a trailer with his credit card, he wrapped them in doona covers and hid the bodies in his garage for two days. While searching for a bush burial site, he purchased a map and petrol on his credit card too. The couple was initially reported missing to Malvern Police by Wales-King's daughter on 8 April, and on 10 April, their vehicle was found. On 29 April, park rangers discovered the shallow grave in bushland near Marysville, Victoria. The two were buried one on top of the other with King lain above Wales-King. Autopsies indicated that the couple had been clubbed and also strangled. =Confession and arrest= Wales's erratic behaviour drew the attention of both his family and investigators, especially given that he did not initially mention to his family that the couple had visited him the night they disappeared. On 11 May, after confessing to police, Wales was charged with the murders. He mentioned burying his mother lower than his stepfather in order to diminish her domineering character. He also told police that King was killed because \\"he blamed him for his parents' separation\\". His wife was charged with being an accessory after the fact to both the alleged murders. Wales had participated at the couple's funeral just three days earlier (seated away from his four older siblings) and was photographed weeping and embracing his elder brother. =Trial= At the Victorian Supreme Court, Wales pleaded guilty and was convicted of the murders. He was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 24 years. The trial judge found Wales, partly due to his low IQ, murdered the couple because he resented his mother, particularly when using her wealth to manipulate him. His wife pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice and received a two-year suspended sentence. She was found not to have played any part in the actual murders. In popular culture In 2003, Melbourne barrister Hilary Bonney wrote a book about the murder, The Society Murders: The True Story of the Wales-King Murders. The book was written without co-operation from the Wales-King family and was based largely on court evidence and police documents. The book was later adapted as a 2006 television film, The Society Murders for Network Ten, written by Greg Haddrick and Kylie Needham for the production company Screentime. The film starred Georgie Parker, Alex Dimitriades, Matthew Le Nevez, Terry Norris and Julia Blake. The story was also examined on the episode \\"The Enemy Within\\" of the series Behind Mansion Walls presented on Investigation Discovery.

Zywicki is a trustee of Yorktown University, a conservative for- profithttp://www.yorktownuniversity.com/documents/hayward_speech.pdf Internet- based university.http://yorktownuniversity.com/new_trustees.cfm Legal scholarship and activities Zywicki has testified on numerous occasions in his personal capacity before committees and subcommittees of the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives on issues of bankruptcy and consumer credit. In 2005, he wrote at The Volokh Conspiracy that \\"the growth in subprime lending is not creating overwhelming debt burdens for low-income households.\\" During the run-up to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), a law that was heavily lobbied for by the financial services industry and that made it more difficult for consumers to discharge their credit card debts in bankruptcy, Professor Zywicki testified before Congress that the law was likely to reduce the costs of debt to all borrowers by reducing losses to credit card lenders: > [W]hen creditors are unable to collect debts because of bankruptcy, some of > those losses are inevitably passed on to responsible Americans who live up > to their financial obligations. . . . We all pay for bankruptcy abuse in > higher down payments, higher interest rates, and higher costs for goods and > services. > This bankruptcy 'tax' takes many forms. It is obviously reflected in higher > interest rates.... It is [also] reflected in shorter grace periods for > paying bills and higher penalty fees and late-charges for those who miss > payments ... [R]educing the number of strategic bankruptcies will reduce the > bankruptcy tax paid by every American family .... These reforms will make > the bankruptcy system more fair, equitable, and efficient, not only for > bankruptcy debtors and creditors, but for all Americans.Todd J. Zywicki, > Statement to Senate Judiciary Committee (Feb. 10, 2005), 2005 W.L. 31992). In his scholarly and popular writing, Professor Zywicki continues to write about issues that are of concern to the credit card industry, continues to suggest that the industry is price-competitive, and continues to argue that the interests of the credit card industry are closely aligned with those of its customers. He has recently argued against efforts to regulate the fees that credit card payment networks charge to merchants, saying that such regulation will harm consumers because credit card companies will try to recover the lost revenue from them. Professor Zywicki's positions have been challenged by financial engineers and legal scholars, including an economist whose work he has cited. Zywicki has been editor of the Supreme Court Economic Review since 2006. He previously served as editor from 2001 to 2002. The Supreme Court Economic Review is ranked second among all law and economics journals in citation impact studies. Zywicki clerked for Judge Jerry Edwin Smith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and worked as an associate at Alston & Bird in Atlanta, Georgia, where he practiced bankruptcy law. While attending law school he was executive editor of the Virginia Tax Review and John M. Olin Scholar in Law and Economics. Zywicki was a leading supporter of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted in 2005 with substantial bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress. One judge faced with interpreting the law stated that one section was \\"one of many examples of poor drafting in the new bankruptcy law, which Professor Todd Zywicki assured the Senate Judiciary Committee was 'fine as it is,' adding, 'There is no word that I would change in this particular piece of legislation.'\\" In re Kane, 336 B.R. 477 (Bkrtcy. D. Nev. 2006). Zywicki responded that the quote was taken out of context, saying his comment referred to whether the bill had become obsolete after having been drafted eight years earlier, and not to whether it had technical glitches. Zywicki is the author of more than 50 articles in law reviews and economics journals. He is a frequent commentator in print and broadcast media and a regular contributor to The Volokh Conspiracy blog. He is a frequent contributor to the media. In a column in The Wall Street Journal in December 2008, Zywicki criticized proposals to bail out the American auto industry, arguing that they should file Chapter 11 instead. In a column in The Wall Street Journal in February 2009, Zywicki criticized proposals to permit bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage contracts. He has also appeared frequently on television and radio. Zywicki has been a prominent critic of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had promoted the creation of the agency.

Panderichthys, which was recovered from Frasnian (early Late Devonian) deposits in Latvia, is represented by two species. P. stolbovi is known only from some snout fragments and an incomplete lower jaw. P. rhombolepis is known from several more complete specimens. Although it probably belongs to a sister group of the earliest tetrapods, Panderichthys exhibits a range of features transitional between tristichopterid lobe-fin fishes (e.g., Eusthenopteron) and early tetrapods. It is named after the German-Baltic paleontologist Christian Heinrich Pander. Possible tetrapod tracks dating back to before the appearance of Panderichthys in the fossil record were reported in 2010, which suggests that Panderichthys is not a direct ancestor of tetrapods, but nonetheless shows the traits that evolved during the fish-tetrapod evolution Discovery and history Panderichthys is represented by two different species: Panderichthys rhombolepis and Panderichthys stobolvi. P. rhombolepis was discovered by Gross in 1930 and P. stobolvi was discovered and figured by Emilia Vorobyeva in 1960. P. rhombolepis was discovered in Lode, Latvia within Frasnian deposits and according to P.E. Ahlberg can definitely be found in other Frasnian deposits in Latvia. Although fossils of Panderichthys have been known for a long time, but they have only recently been examined in full. The first time they were recognized as being phylogenetically closer to tetrapods than fish was by Shultze and Arsenault in 1985. Description Digital restoration Panderichthys is a 90‚Äì130 cm long fish with a large tetrapod-like head that's flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back. The intracranial joint, which is characteristic of most lobe-fin fishes, has been lost from the external elements of the skull, but is still present in the braincase. The patterns of external bones in the skull roof and cheeks are more similar to those of early tetrapods than those of other lobe-fins. The transitional qualities of Panderichthys are also evident in the rest of the body. It lacks the dorsal and anal fins (fish fin) and its tail is more like those of early tetrapods than the caudal fins of other lobe-fins. The shoulders exhibits several tetrapod-like features, while the humerus is longer than those found in other lobe-fins. The vertebral column is ossified throughout its length and the vertebrae are comparable to those of early tetrapods. On the other hand, the distal parts of the front fins are unlike those of tetrapods. As would be expected from a fin, there are numerous lepidotrichia (long and thin fin rays). Panderichthys has many features that can be considered an intermediate form during the fish-tetrapod evolution and displays some features that are more derived than its phylogenetic position indicates, while others that are more basal. The body form of Panderichthys and Tiktaalik represents a major step in the transition from fish to tetrapods and they were even able to haul out on land.Ahlberg, Per Erik, and Jennifer A. Clack. \\"Palaeontology: a firm step from water to land.\\" Nature 440.7085 (2006): 747-749 According to Shultze and Trueb, Panderichthys shares ten features with tetrapods: The skull roof is flat compared to fish skulls. The orbits are more dorsal and closer together. The external naris is close to the margin of the upper jaw. Paired frontals. External intracranial joint is absent. Parietal located between the orbits and main portion posterior to orbits. In P. rhombolepis, the squamosal touches the maxilla (varies among specimens though). Teeth have complex polyplocodont structure. Lack of median fins. In panderichthyids and Ichthyostega ribs are attached to the neural arch and there is an intercentrum.Schultze, Hans-Peter, and Linda Trueb, eds. Origins of the higher groups of tetrapods: controversy and consensus. Cornell University Press, 1991. =Humerus= Comparison between the limbs of Sarcopterygiin fishes and tetrapods, C denotes Panderichthys One of the key transitional features of Panderichthys is its humerus. During the transition from fish to tetrapods the limbs began to move and became located at a right angle to the body rather than being oriented toward the posterior end. As a result, the muscles became perpendicular to the body and caused the limbs to move in a more anteroposterior and dorsoventral pattern. This in turn affected the shape of the humerus and as a result early tetrapods have an L-shaped humerus.Shubin, N. H., Daeschler, E. B. and Coates, M. I. 2004. The early evolution of the tetrapod humerus. ‚Äì Science 304: 90‚Äì93. Due to a recent discovery of a humerus of Panderichthys that was not flattened, the specimen could be analyzed in much greater detail. The humerus of Panderichthys displays a variety of features including ones that are both primitive and derived. Despite being placed as basal to Tiktaalik, the humerus of Panderichthys has features that are more derived, but overall is very similar. Both Panderichthys and Tiktaalik have humeri that are dorsoventrally flattened with a blade like entepicondyle curving ventrally, separated epipodial facets, a latissimus dorsi process and ectepicondule process that is parallel to the preaxial margin. The humeri of both species are considered transitional forms because they are almost L-shaped, have a low latissimus dorsi process, a low entepicondyle, and an intermediate entepicondylar canal. The humerus of Panderichthys is more derived than that of Tiktaalik because of the presence of a more preaxially oriented radial facet as well as a more slender shaft. One feature that is unique to Panderichthys is that the entepicondyle does not project as far as the epipodial facets and the humeral ridge does not go into the entepicondyle.Boisvert, Catherine A. \\"The humerus of Panderichthys in three dimensions and its significance in the context of the fish‚Äìtetrapod transition.\\" Acta Zoologica90.s1 (2009): 297-305. The result of the analysis of the humerus of Panderichthys is that the transition of the humerus from the fish-like organisms to tetrapods occurred much slower than previously thought and Panderichthys now provides a base to determine many autapomorphies. Due to the orientation of the fin towards the posterior end, the attitude of the limb is more horizontal than vertical and the operational space in which it acts is level to the shoulder joint, which causes the muscles to pull at a right angle to the body. This resulted in the ability of Panderichthys to prop up its large head most likely to breathe.Clack, Jennifer A. \\"From fins to fingers.\\" Science 304.5667 (2004): 57-58. =Fins and digits= Another key feature of Panderichthys is its intermediate form during the evolution of digits. In the past it was believed that digits and fingers had no analogous part in sarcopterygian fish and were evolutionary novelties. However, recent reexaminationhttp://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24381533-5016574,00.html of existing Panderichthys fossils using a CT scanner shows four very clearly differentiated distal radial bones at the end of the fin skeletal structure. The study performed by Boisvert et al. in 2008 examined the pectoral fins of Panderichthys and found that the fins of Panderichthys are oriented anteroposteriorly, which is different from the limbs of tetrapods that project at an angle from the body. The humerus, radius (bone), and ulna all are analogous to the parts in tetrapods, but the CT scan uncovered the distal fin endoskeleton for the first time. The CT scan performed displayed an ulnare that articulates with the ulna and two terminal radials as well as an intermedium articulating in line to the lateral ridge of the ulna. The CT scan also uncovered radials that can be interpreted as digits, disproving the hypothesis that digits are new structures in tetrapods. These finger-like bones show neither muscle development nor joints and they are extremely small, but nonetheless show an intermediate form between fully fish-like fins and tetrapods. Similar to the humerus, Panderichthys also has a more derived feature than Tiktaalik because it has an ulna that is longer than its ulnare, which is a feature of tetrapods.Boisvert, Catherine A., Elga Mark-Kurik, and Per E. Ahlberg. \\"The pectoral fin of Panderichthys and the origin of digits.\\" Nature 456.7222 (2008): 636-638. =Pelvic girdle= Restoration showing side to side undulation Additionally, the pelvic girdle and pelvic fins of Panderichthys represents an intermediate in the fish-tetrapod evolution. During the fish-tetrapod evolution the pelvic girdle became a weight bearing structure when the ilium, meso-ventral contact of the sides of the girdle, an ilium, and a sacral rib developed. The femur and humerus became longer and the radius/ulna and tibia/fibula became more equal in length. In general, the pelvic girdle in Panderichthys is more primitive than the pectoral girdle. This is due to the humerus of Panderichthys being a shape that is more of an intermediate, while the femur is more primitive because of the length ratio to the fibula and that it lacks an adductor blade and crest. This implies that Panderichthys was not capable of tetrapod-like hindlimb propelled locomotion because of its small pelvic fins, non-weight bearing pelvic girdle, acetebelum oriented posteriorly, and limited knee and elbow flexion.Boisvert, Catherine A. \\"The pelvic fin and girdle of Panderichthys and the origin of tetrapod locomotion.\\" Nature 438.7071 (2005): 1145-1147. Boisvert describes the locomotion of Panderichthys as possibly using one of its pectoral fins to anchor itself while side to side undulation propels the body forward. =Skull= Lastly, the braincase of Panderichthys demonstrates a key intermediate within the fish-evolution sequence. From the outside, Panderichthys has a tetrapod-like head, but actually retains an intracranial joint that is a characteristic of fish. Panderichthys shares many features with the osteolepiform Eusthenopteron such as similar hyomandibular and basipterygoid processes. Even though its head is shaped similar to that of a tetrapod, tetrapod craniums lack a lateral commissure, jugular groove, basicranial fenestra, arcual plate, and intracranial joint, all of which are present in Panderichthys. What this means is that there was no major change of the braincase construction since the first sarcopterygian, but instead there had been only changes in skull shape. This implies that the evolution of the braincase during the transition from fish-tetrapod was very rapid and seems to display the same timing as the evolution of the pelvic girdle. In general, Panderichthys demonstrates that the braincase structure evolved much more slowly than the external skull morphology that created the tetrapod-like appearance of the head.Ahlberg, Per E., Jennifer A. Clack, and Ervƒ´ns Luk&sbreve.; \\"Rapid braincase evolution between Panderichthys and the earliest tetrapods.\\" (1996): 61-64. As for the lower jaw and dentition, the lower jaw is similar to Rhipidistians and is composed of a tooth-bearing dentary, four intradentaries, a lingual prearticular, three coronoids, and an adsymphsial plate dorsally. In addition, the teeth are of polyplocodont structure. Paleobiology =Air breathing structures= Restoration of P. rhombolepis As an intermediate in the fish-tetrapod evolution, Panderichthys had the capacity to breathe air. The trend from the early sarcopterygians to the first tetrapods was an increase in the size of the spiracular chamber and its opening to the outside. Compared to Eusthenopteron, the spiracular chamber of Panderichthys is greatly expanded and the hyomandibula is shorter compared to those in fish. The opercular series was also shorter compared to other osteolepiforms. Panderichthys also has a single external nasal opening and a palatal choana. In contrast to earlier osteolepiforms, the palatal choana is elongated and the nariochoanal lamina is narrow. Along with the spiracular chamber, this feature in Panderichthys can be considered transitional during the evolution from fish to tetrapods. Sarcopterygians such as Panderichthys can be considered at least facultative air breathers and demonstrate an intermediate form as air breathing was becoming more abundant. Classification Panderichthys in evolutionary context In January 2010, Nature reported well-preserved and \\"securely dated\\" tetrapod tracks from Polish marine tidal flat sediments approximately 397 million years old.Niedzwiedzki, G., Szrek, P., Narkiewicz, K., Narkiewicz, M and Ahlberg, P., Nature 463(7227):43‚Äì48, 2010, Tetrapod trackways from the early Middle Devonian period of Poland, 7 January 2010. These fossil tracks suggest that a group of two meter long tetrapods lived in the fully marine intertidal or lagoonal areas on the south coast of Laurussia during the time elpistostegids were living. This implies that Panderichthys is not a transitional fossil and represents its own adaptive morphology. Therefore, Panderichthys can only be a \\"late-surviving relic\\",Editor's summary: Four feet in the past: trackways pre- date earliest body fossils. Nature 463. showing traits that evolved during the transition from fish-like creatures to tetrapods, but whose date does not reflect that transition. The tracks \\"force a radical reassessment of the timing, ecology and environmental setting of the fish‚Äìtetrapod transition, as well as the completeness of the body fossil record.\\" Palaeoecology Late Devonian fish and tetrapods Panderichthys was alive during the late Devonian (Frasnian) in Lode, Latvia. Lode is known to be a marginal marine environment and it has been hypothesized that Panderichthys was adapted for movement in shallow and debris filled waters.Clack, Jennifer A. \\"Devonian climate change, breathing, and the origin of the tetrapod stem group.\\" Integrative and Comparative Biology 47.4 (2007): 510-523. Panderichthys was collected in deposits that were formerly believed to be from a calm freshwater basin, but have proven to be from shallow tidal flats or an estuary. The Lode Formation, where P. rhombolepis was found, occurs within a 200-meter thick layer composed of fine grained sandstone and clay along with finely dispersed clays. Nearly every major taxa of late Devonian vertebrates are represented within the Lode Formation. Most of the specimens are well preserved due to anaerobic substrate conditions as well as rapid burial in depressions on the submarine delta slopes. P. rhombolepis was discovered in the Gauja Regional formation within the lower Frasnian section. Taphocoenosis was characterized as in finely displaced clay and silty clay as well as low water activity. Within this environment it has been hypothesized that P. rhombolepis was a large predator and fed upon dipterids, small and juvenile sarcopterygians, and Latvius.Upeniece, Ieva. Paleoecology and juvenile individuals of the Devonian Placoderm and Acanthodian fishes from Lode site, Latvia. Diss. University of Latvia, 2011. Associated vertebrates found in the same deposits include an armored jawless fish (Psammolepis), two placoderms (Asterolepis and Plourdosteus), an unidentified acanthodid acanthodian, a porolepiform lobe-fin (Laccognathus), a lungfish (Dipterus), and another elpistostegalian (Livoniana). Zachelmie tracks vs selected Devonian fossils During the Frasnian in which Panderichthys was extant, there was a drop in oxygen in the atmosphere as well as an increase in the abundance of plants. Due to the fact that oxygen is much less soluble in water than air, the decreased oxygen in the atmosphere would have caused the oxygen concentrations in any type of water to decrease substantially. This in turn would have caused any aquatic animal that could breathe air to have an advantage and be more likely to thrive. In addition to its ability to move in shallow water, Panderichthys could also breathe air. Its strong pectoral fins in theory could allow it to prop up its head in shallow water and take a breath. The enlargement of the spiracular chamber itself as well as its opening to the outside suggests that Panderichthys was part of a transition to an increased capacity for air breathing that was completed in tetrapods.

It was discovered on 21 February 1906 by August Kopff from Heidelberg. Kopff named the asteroid after a female English student with whom he was acquainted. Overview On 11 December 2010, Steve Larson of the Catalina Sky Survey detected a comet-like appearance to asteroid Scheila: it displayed a \\"coma\\" of about magnitude 13.5. Inspection of archival Catalina Sky Survey observations showed the activity was triggered between 11 November 2010 and 3 December. Imaging with the 2-meter Faulkes Telescope North revealed a linear tail in the anti-sunward direction and an orbital tail, indicative of larger slower particles.Richard Miles's posting on Yahoo minor planet mailing list (MPML) When first detected it was unknown what drove the ejecta plumes. Scheila's gravity is too large for electrostatics to launch dust. Cometary outgassing could not be ruled out until detailed spectroscopic observations indicated the absence of gas in Scheila's plumes. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Swift Gamma Ray Burst Mission's UV-optical telescope make it most likely that Scheila was impacted at ~5 km/s by a previously unknown asteroid ~35 meters in diameter. In 2010, the Hubble Space Telescope observed the aftermath of a catastrophic collision that destroyed the much smaller asteroid P/2010 A2. Each asteroid the size of Scheila might be hit by an impactor 10‚Äì100 meters in diameter approximately every 1000 years, so with 200 asteroids of this size or bigger in the asteroid belt, we can observe a collision as often as every 5 years. Scheila last came to perihelion on 2012 May 19.

The M11/39 saw service in Africa and Italy (1939‚Äì1944). The official Italian designation was Carro Armato (armoured vehicle) M11/39. The designation for the M11/39 is as follows: \\"M\\" for Medio (Italian: \\"medium\\"), followed by the weight in tonnes (11) and the year of adoption (1939). Development The M11/39 was developed as a \\"breakthrough tank\\" (). The design of the M11/39 was influenced by the British Vickers 6-Ton. This influence is reflected particularly in the track and suspension design. A novelty of the design was the placement of the final reduction gears inside the front-mounted drive sprockets, eliminating the need for enlarged final drive housings in the bow armour. Service use of the M11/39 was short due to several deficiencies in its design, particularly the placement of the main 37 mm gun in the hull. The design concept was to use the main gun against other tanks and to defend the tank with the turret armament. The gun was in a fixed position with traverse restricted to 15¬∞ to port and starboard. Dual 8 mm machine guns were housed in a small rotating one-man turret, with manual controls. The original intent was to place the 37 mm /L40 armament in the turret but there was insufficient space. The gun placement followed the French Char B1 and anticipated the early versions of the Churchill tanks, although in these tanks the hull guns were howitzers, rather than high-velocity guns. The M11/39 had other shortcomings: its endurance and performance were poor, it was relatively slow, it was mechanically unreliable and its 30 mm maximum riveted steel armour, designed to withstand 20 mm fire, was vulnerable to British 2-pounder guns at any range at which the M11/39s main gun was effective. The tank was designed to carry a radio but none were fitted to the production vehicles. The M11/39 hull was modified for use its successor the Fiat M13/40, which was redesigned to put the main gun in the turret; an order for 100 M11s was placed as a stop-gap.  Units  Only two battalions received the M11/39 tank before production was switched to the better M13/40: * I Tank Battalion \\"M\\", 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment * II Tank Battalion \\"M\\", 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment Both battalions were sent to North Africa for the Italian invasion of Egypt and assigned for the campaign to the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment. The regiment and both battalions were destroyed during Operation Compass, with the last remnants extinguished during the Battle of Beda Fomm. Combat In Libya 72 √ó M11/39s were used in the North African Campaign, 24 operated in the East Africa Campaign and the first four prototypes remained in Italy. The M11 was vastly superior to the 36 √ó L3/33 and L3/35 tankettes stationed in East Africa. The M11/39 proved somewhat successful in early encounters with the British Light Tank Mk VI. The 37 mm gun of the M11 acted as a deterrent against attacks by these relatively fast but thin-skinned vehicles, armed only with machine guns. The tank was outclassed by heavier British cruiser and Infantry tanks, the Cruiser Mk I (A9), Cruiser Mk II (A10), Cruiser Mk III (A13) and Matilda. =North Africa= On 13 September 1940, M11s participated in the Italian invasion of Egypt. On 9 December 1940, M11s also operated defensively in the opening stages of the British counter-offensive, Operation Compass. When Operation Compass was launched, many of the M11/39s were damaged, broken, or immobilized inside some of the static Italian positions. The British used Matilda tanks to overrun many of the Italian positions and the M11s could do little against the heavy armour of the Matildas. From 10 April 1941, during the siege of Tobruk, some captured M11s were employed by the 6th Australian Division Cavalry Regiment over some months. The Australians painted large white kangaroo symbols on the tanks and used the captured M11s, together with several M13s, until they ran out of diesel fuel. The tanks were then destroyed to deny them to the advancing Axis forces in the spring of 1941. =East Africa= In 1940, Italian East Africa received 24 M11/39s. In East Africa, the M11s fought as the only medium tank available to the Italians. On 3 August 1940, M11s participated in The Italian Invasion of British Somaliland. By January 1941, M11s were used on the defensive in Eritrea when the British launched their counter-offensive there. Unfortunately for the Italians, the British had a small number of Matilda tanks available to them during the Battle of Keren and this negated any value that the M11s may have added. By the end of May 1941, the Italian forces were defeated on the East African fronts where M11s were deployed. By the end of November, organized Italian resistance in East Africa was over. There is no indication that captured M11s were re-used by the captors in East Africa.

The term \\"wet gas\\" has been used to describe a range of conditions varying from a humid gas which is gas saturated with liquid vapour to a multiphase flow with a 90% volume of gas. There has been some debate as to its actual definition but there is currently no fully defined quantitative definition of a wet gas flow that is universally accepted. Wet gas is a particularly important concept in the field of flow measurement, as the varying densities of the constituent material present a significant problem. A typical example of wet gas flows are in the production of natural gas in the oil and gas industry. Natural gas is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds with quantities of various non hydrocarbons. This exists in either a gaseous or liquid phase or in solution with crude oil in porous rock formations. The amount of hydrocarbons present in the liquid phase of the wet gas extracted depends on the reservoir temperature and pressure conditions, which change over time as the gas and liquid are removed. Changes in the liquid and gas content also occur when a wet gas is transported from a reservoir at high temperature and pressure to the surface where it experiences a lower temperature and pressure. The presence and changeability of this wet gas can cause problems and errors in the ability to accurately measure the gas phase flowrate. It is important to be able to measure these wet gas flows accurately to quantify production from individual wells and to maximise the use of equipment and resources which will assist with the reduction of costs.  Wet gas measurement terms  There are a number of specific terms used to describe the characteristics of wet gas flow: Superficial gas velocity is the gas velocity if there were no liquid present in the wet gas flow. In wet gas flows the gas velocity is higher due to a reduction in the pipe area caused by the presence of the liquid. Superficial liquid velocity is the liquid velocity if there were no gas present in the wet gas flow. Liquid load is the ratio of the liquid mass flow rate to the gas mass flow rate and is normally expressed as a percentage. GVF ‚Äì Gas volume fraction is the ratio of the gas volumetric flow rate to the total volumetric flow rate. LVF ‚Äì Liquid volume fraction is the ratio of the liquid volumetric flow rate to the total volumetric flow rate. Hold up is the cross sectional area occupied by the liquid in the pipe carrying the wet gas flow. Void fraction is the ratio of the flow area occupied by the gas to the total flow area. Lockhart‚ÄìMartinelli parameter.Lockhart, R.W., Martinelli, R.C.; Chem. Eng. Prog., Vol. 45. 1949, pp. 39‚Äì48 Gas is compressible and the density changes significantly with changes in pressure. Liquids, on the other hand, are considered to be incompressible and so their density does not tend to change with a change in pressure. If the pressure of a wet gas system increases, the density of the gas will increase but the density of the liquid will not change. The densities of the flow components are an important consideration in flow measurement as they relate to the actual mass quantities of the fluids present. To account for both the flow rates and densities of the liquid and gas phases it is common practice to define the wetness or liquid loading of the gas using the Lockhart‚ÄìMartinelli parameter, referred to as œá (Greek letter chi), which is a dimensionless number. This parameter can be calculated from the mass flow rate or volumetric flow rate and the density of the fluids. It is defined as: : \\\\chi = \\\\frac{m_\\\\ell}{m_g} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\rho_g}{\\\\rho_\\\\ell}}, where *m_\\\\ell is the liquid phase mass flow rate; *m_g is the gas phase mass flow rate; *\\\\rho_g is the gas density; *\\\\rho_\\\\ell is the liquid density. This Lockhart‚ÄìMartinelli parameter œá can be used to define a completely dry gas when the value is zero. A wet gas flow has a value of œá between zero and about 0.3 and values above 0.3 are usually defined as multiphase flows.  Wet gas flow patterns  The behavior of the gases and liquid in a flowing pipe will exhibit various flow characteristics depending on the gas pressure, gas velocity and liquid content, as well as orientation of the piping (horizontal, sloping or vertical). The liquid may be in the form of tiny droplets or the pipe may be filled completely with liquid. Despite the complexity of gas and liquid interaction, attempts have been made to categorize this behavior. These gas and liquid interactions are commonly referred to as flow regimes or flow patterns. Annular mist flow occurs at high gas velocities. A thin film of liquid is present around the annulus of the pipe. Typically most of the liquid is entrained in the form of droplets in the gas core. As a result of gravity, there is usually a thicker film of liquid on the bottom of the pipe as opposed to the top of the pipe. Stratified (smooth) flow exists when the gravitational separation is complete. The liquid flows along the bottom of the pipe as gas flows over the top. Liquid holdup in this regime can be large but the gas velocities are low. Stratified wave flow is similar to stratified smooth flow, but with a higher gas velocity. The higher gas velocity produces waves on the liquid surface. These waves may become large enough to break off liquid droplet at the peaks of the waves and become entrained in the gas. These droplets are distributed further down the pipe. Slug flow is where large frothy waves of liquid form a slug that can fill the pipe completely. These slugs may also be in the form of a surge wave that exists upon a thick film of liquid on the bottom of the pipe. Elongated bubble flow consists of a mostly liquid flow with elongated bubbles present closer to the top of the pipe. Dispersed flow assume a pipe is completely filled with liquid with a small amount of entrained gas. The gas is in the form of smaller bubbles. These bubbles of gas have a tendency to reside in the top region of the pipe as gravity holds the liquid in the bottom of the pipe. Wet gas metering There may be situations in which only the flow rate of the single key gas component is required, in this case single phase metering may be employed. The measurement can then be adjusted to compensate for the effect of the liquid on the meter. Some of the techniques available for measuring the liquid phase include: A Test separator which determines the phase flow rates by physical separation of the liquid from the gas, with each phase then metered separately. This method provides information on all phases which can then be used to calculate the correction required for a meter and to check the gas flow through the meter. The pressure and temperature at the test separator should be the same as at the wet gas flow meter or the gas and liquid flow rates must be corrected for the conditions at the meter as phases could be different from those measured. Sampling is where a sample of the wet gas is removed from the pipe line for analysis to determine the constituent components. It is important that a sample is collected that is representative of both the gas and liquid phase fractions and that there is no mass transfer between the phases during sampling. Tracer method involves injecting a tracer dye into the wet gas flow and then sampling at a specific distance down stream to measure the dilution of the dye. The dilution of the dye in the liquid phase is used to calculate the liquid flow rate. This technique can be rather difficult to apply as it can be difficult gaining access to the correct points needed to conduct this test. Microwave technology utilises the higher permittivity of water than hydrocarbons to detect the overall water fraction in the liquid and gas phases. As it only detects and measures the water component, the liquid hydrocarbon component must be measured by another method. Overall pressure loss across different pressure meters using a Venturi tube to measure flow causes a pressure drop in the flow which is partly recovered downstream of the meter. In dry gas flows the recovery is greater than in wet gas flows due to the liquid component. This difference can be exploited to provide a measurement for the liquid fraction. This involves adding a second pressure tapping downstream of the Venturi to provide a measure of the partly recovered pressure drop. This method can be affected by changes in the system pressure and gas velocity. Advanced signal processing is used where a liquid phase has an effect on the measurement signal such as pressure fluctuations in a DP flow meter or shift in the speed of sound in ultrasonic flow meter. Complex analysis and modelling of these signals can determine the liquid and gas flows. There are a number of commercially available wet gas flow meters. Most of the meters use differential pressure for the gas phase and a form of liquid detection or wet gas density measurement for the liquid phase normally utilising one of the techniques listed above.

It is currently manufactured by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation. The aircraft is operated by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) of China (PRC). Development =Proposed J-11= In the 1970s, Shenyang Aircraft Factory proposed a new designed light fighter powered by the British Rolls-Royce Spey 512 engine, with better maneuverability than MiG-19 then in service and better climb rate than the MiG-21. Known as the J-11, the project was abandoned due to difficulties in obtaining the engines. =Modern J-11= The J-11 was finally born in 1998 as a Chinese version of the Soviet- designed Sukhoi Su-27SK air superiority fighter after China secured a $US2.5 billion production agreement which licensed China to build 200 Su-27SK aircraft using Russian-supplied kits. Under the terms of the agreement, these aircraft would be outfitted with Russian avionics, radars and engines. However, in 2004, Russian media reported that Shenyang co-production of the basic J-11 was halted after around 100 examples were built. The PLAAF later revealed a mock-up of an upgraded multi-role version of the J-11 in mid-2002. The indigenous J-11B variant incorporates various Chinese material modifications and upgrades to the airframe with improved manufacturing methods in addition to the inclusion of domestic Chinese technologies such as radar, avionics suites and weaponry, including anti-ship and PL-12 air-to-air missiles presumably for the role of a maritime strike aircraft. The alleged reason for the sudden stop in the production line of the J-11 was because it could no longer satisfy the PLAAF's requirements, due to elements such as the obsolete avionics and radar, which were structured for aerial missions. The J-11/J-11B's legitimacy remains unproven, despite a wealth of information coming to light since 2007. In the course of a press conference at the 2009 Farnborough Airshow, Alexander Fomin, Deputy Director of Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Co-operation, reported that Russia had not so far tabled any questions to China with regard to \\"copying\\" military equipment. Fomin reported that Russia handed China the licences to manufacture the aircraft and its components, including an agreement on the production of intellectual property rights. Details of intellectual property rights, however have not been disclosed, fuelling speculation about a \\"secret\\" contract or parts of the original contract. The licence, at least officially, did not include an aircraft carrier version- Sukhoi Su-33 nor any variant of it, such as the Shenyang J-15.Andreas Rupprecht. December 2011. \\"China's 'Flanker' gains momentum. Shenyang J-11 update\\". Combat Aircraft Monthly. Vol. 12, No. 12, p. 40‚Äì42. At the MAKS 2009, Rosoboronexport's General Manager Anatoli Isaykin was quoted saying: \\"Russia is going to investigate the J-11B, as a Chinese copy of the Su-27 and Sukhoi Company is partaking in the process.\\" In 2010, Rosoboronexport announced via their official website that it was in talks with the Chinese side, regarding the ongoing production of weapons that Russia considers as un-licensed. In light of the ongoing investigations, Rosoboronexport expressed its concern over future sales of advanced Russian systems and components to China.http://www.roe.ru/news/lenty/lenta_10_11_17.html At the Zhuhai 2002 airshow, a photo was released allegedly depicting a J-11 modified for flight testing of a single WS-10 Taihang turbofan. Andrei Chang, a military specialist on China reported that one J-11A was outfitted with the indigenously produced WS-10A turbofan engine, J-11B also uses WS-10A. However, Russian media reports also indicate that China still intends to upgrade the current J-11 fleet's engines with either Saturn-Lyulka or Salyut powerplants. Engines under consideration include the Saturn AL-31-117S (a development of the Lyulka AL-31F planned for the Russo-Indian Su-30MKIs), and the Salyut AL-31F-M1, an improved variant of the AL-31F engine. In 2002, Russian media reported that Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was looking into replacing Russian-made J-11/Su-27SK components with domestic, Chinese-made parts. Specifically, to replace the Russian-made NIIP N001 radar with a Chinese-made fire control radar based on the Type 147X/KLJ-X family, the AL-31F engine with WS-10A, and Russian R-77 AAM's with Chinese-made PL-9 and PL-12 AAM's. One J-11 was photographed with an AL-31F and a WS-10A engine installed for testing in 2002. However, it was not until 2007 when the Chinese government finally revealed information on the domestic J-11: the J-11 used to test WS-10 was designated as J-11WS, and it was when state television station CCTV-7 aired J-11B footages in mid-2007 when the existence of J-11 with domestic components was finally confirmed officially. Serial manufacturing of the WS-10 and integration with the J-11, proved to be more difficult than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested and at least one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor operational reliability. A report in the Washington Times suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions. Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality control procedures. Several subsequent batches temporarily reverted to the original, Russian AL-31F turbofans. The engines manufacturing problems had finally been solved by the end of 2009 and the WS-10A had reportedly proved mature enough to power the Block 02 aircraft. Operational history In March 2011 a joint Sino-Pakistani exercise, Shaheen 1, was conducted at a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base involving a contingent of Chinese aircraft and personnel from the PLAAF. Information on which aircraft were used by each side in the exercise was not released, but photos of Pakistani pilots inspecting what appeared to be Chinese Shenyang J-11B fighters were released on the internet. The exercise lasted for around 4 weeks and was the first time the PLAAF had deployed to and conducted \\"operational\\" aerial maneuvers in Pakistan with the PAF. = P-8 interception = Chinese Shenyang J-11B fighter intercepting an American P-8. The photo was taken by the crew of the P-8. PL-8 and two PL-12 missiles. On 19 August 2014 a Chinese J-11B intercepted a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine warfare aircraft that was over the South China Sea. At a press conference on August 22, 2014, Admiral John Kirby, the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense told reporters that \\"On the 19th of August, an armed Chinese fighter jet conducted a dangerous intercept of a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft, patrol aircraft, that was on a routine mission. The intercept took place about 135 miles east of Hainan Island, in international airspace.\\" He elaborated on the incident, saying that the Chinese jet: \\"crossed under the aircraft with one pass having only 50‚Äì100 feet separation. The Chinese jet also passed the nose of the P-8 at 90 degrees with its belly toward the P-8 Poseidon, believed to be displaying its weapons load- out. Afterwards, the J-11 flew directly under and alongside the P-8, bringing their wingtips, as I said, to within 20 feet. And then conducted a roll over the P-8, passing within 45 feet.\\" The Pentagon spokesman said that the U.S. had registered an official complaint with China through regular diplomatic channels. He also said that the Chinese pilot's actions had been \\"unprofessional, it's unsafe, and it is certainly not keeping with the kind of military-to-military relationship\\" that U.S. seeks to establish with China. Moreover, in reference to the plane's proximity to China, the Pentagon said that, \\"Military activities may be conducted within the Exclusive Economic Zone of another nation as an exercise of the freedoms of navigation and overflight.\\" In response, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesman Yang Yujun said that the relevant criticism made by the U.S. side was \\"totally groundless,\\" as the Chinese pilot, with professional operation, kept the jet within a safe distance from the U.S. aircraft. He also said it was the U.S. massive and frequent close-in surveillance of China that endangered the two sides' air and marine security, and was the root of accidents. He added that China urged the U.S. side to abide by international law and international practice, respect concerns of the coastal countries, and properly deal with the differences between the two sides on air and marine security issues. Variants * J-11A ‚Äì Chinese/Russian assembled Su-27SK from Russian-made kits. 104 were built. They were later upgraded with MAWS.
