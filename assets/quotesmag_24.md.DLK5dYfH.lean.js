Zhang Jun (, 1086–1154), was a Chinese military general and politician who fought during the Jin–Song Wars. His battle with Jurchen commander Wuzhu at Mingzhou near the temporary Song capital of Hangzhou briefly halted the Jin advance, giving the Song Emperor Gaozong the chance to flee the city by ship. Soon after, his army suppressed rebellions and banditry in the south alongside the generals Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, Yang Qizhong, and others. Emperor Gaozong diminished the power of the military by moving Yue, Han, and Zhang to civilian positions in 1141. A year later, the Song finished negotiating a peace treaty with the Jin.

However, Dewsbury's manager, Eddie Waring, appealed to the Rugby Football League, claiming that Bradford Northern had fielded Wakefield Trinity's Sandy Orford as a guest player, and that Orford was ineligible because prior to the semi-final, he had played only three league matches for Bradford Northern, rather than the regulatory minimum of four league matches, the semi-final actually being Orford's fourth league match. Bradford Northern was disqualified, and Dewsbury went on to a 33-16 aggregate victory over Halifax in the Championship Final. However, a month later, Bradford appealed to the Rugby Football League, claiming that Dewsbury had fielded Castleford's Frank Smith as a guest player, and that Smith was ineligible because prior to the semi-final, he had played only three league matches for Dewsbury, rather than the regulatory minimum of four league matches, though he had played in a number of cup matches. Bradford Northern's appeal was upheld and the Rugby Football League Council fined Dewsbury £100 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £11,780 in 2013), stripped them of the Championship title, and declared the Championship during the 1942–43 season void.

The club play in the BAFA National Leagues Premier Division North for the 2018 season. They play out of the JMO Sports Park in Skelmersdale but train in Liverpool, Merseyside. They were formed as the Wirral Wolves following a speculative advertisement placed in the Wirral Globe by Paul Tiplady. They played their first game, a friendly against Leigh Razorbacks as part of an America Day in Arrowe Park in the spring of 1985. They played a series of friendly games in 1985, joined the Amateur American Football Conference for 1986 reaching the 'Steel Bowl' Final and the British American Football League in 1987. They played in Black and Silver and based their uniform on the LA Raiders.The Wolves disbanded in early 1988 but former Wolves players went on to form the Birkenhead Nighthawks around this time. History=1985 season= Training at the former Ellerman Lines Cricket Ground, in Hoylake, West Wirral, the Wolves used a playing field in Arrowe Park as their matchday base. They amassed a 6-3 record in friendly fixtures, defeating prominent clubs such as the Steel City Giants (38-31), Stoke Spitfires and Sherwood Outlaws. =1986 season= The Wirral Wolves joined the AAFC West Division alongside teams from St Helens, Macclesfield and Runcorn. They played their home games at Birkenhead Park RUFC's Upper Park ground, having first faced Leigh Razorbacks and Coventry Bears there during the winter. They won the Western Division with an 8-2 record, losing only to Steel City (home interconference fixture) and St Helens (away), beating eventual champions Scunthorpe Steelers away in an early season matchup.Davies S. Review of Wirral Wolves' season in 'Steel Bowl '86 Match Programme'. 28 September 1986. They reached the AAFC Steel Bowl championship game, played on 28 September 1986 they lost 50-32 to the Steelers in the final, with five passing touchdowns by their well renowned passing offense, spearheaded by quarterback Danny Aguado, Wide Receiver Manny Owolabi and Running Back Wayne Freeman. =1987 season= In the closed season the Wolves management negotiated the use of Tranmere Rovers' Prenton Park Stadium with new Tranmere owner Peter Johnson who had taken over earlier that year. The preseason was marked by a fixture against an Oregon High School All-Stars team at New Brighton F.C. in which San Diego Chargers' Quarterback Dan Fouts attended as the guest of honour. They regularly attracted paying attendances of 500-1000 for home games at Prenton Park. Having lost at home to Lancashire, they faced the Washington Presidents knowing that only a win would put them back into playoff contention. This, the most exhilarating game of the 1987 season, was played in front of around 1000 enthusiastic fans at the home of Tranmere Rovers. Washington had an experienced Quarterback, Tynesider Jeff Rutter, who led the league in TD passes with 39 and averaged over 400 yards a game. Washington were leading 19-0 at the end of the first quarter, but the Wolves chipped away at the lead and eventually brought the scores level at 54-54 in the fourth quarter. The Wolves then forged ahead 62-60 with a go-ahead touchdown and almost intercepted Rutter to secure the game. Alas the Presidents were able to engineer one final touchdown and ran out 66-62 winners in a game of 19 touchdowns.Davies S. 'Air Powered Dynamoes from Merseyside'. Receiver Magazine 1988. The Wolves missed the playoffs as a consequence of the loss but have the consolation that the game is recognised in British American Football as one of the best of all time. =1988 season= Although tipped for success in 1988 deteriorating relations between coach George Aguado and some Wolves players led to irreconcilable disagreements such that the club was forced to disband. As stated above, several players joined up with former Wolf Gary Lee who had founded the Birkenhead Nighthawks. The Nighthawks merged with Wirral's other club, the Cheshire Cats and went on to have great success at national level in subsequent years. Some remnants of the Wolves organisation were later involved in running the Prestatyn Panthers but this team was no match for the Wolves' long time rivals the Mersey Centurions when they finally met in a league game at Toxteth Sports Centre. As the Wolves and Centurions never played each other the question of which of these two rivals from the opposite sides of the Mersey was the stronger in their heyday in the early days of the sport on Merseyside was never resolved. Despite the loss of the senior team, a Wirral Wolves junior team run by Derek Chapman continued to play throughout the 1988 season and provided players to several local clubs thereafter. Impact of the Wolves The Wolves are remembered as the first American Football club on the Wirral to take the field (for historical accuracy Gridiron UK magazine listed an earlier club in Wallasey known as the 'Redskin Razorbacks' but this outfit did not attract sufficient members to constitute a viable team). The short life of the club coincided with the first surge in popularity of American Football in the United Kingdom after Channel 4 began screening the game in 1982 and their matches at Tranmere Rovers' Prenton Park attracted relatively large crowds for amateur sport. The Birkenhead Nighthawks/Merseyside Nighthawks were able to keep the flame burning for the sport on the Wirral and in Merseyside and achieved substantial success in later years. This success was displayed as the team was able to go undefeated during the 2014 and 2015 seasons and lead to two bowl victories, both over the Edinburgh Wolves. The 2016 season was the first season in the Premier North for the rejuvenated team since their 2012 Season in which they finished with a 1-9 record, with a victory in the last game of the season over the Coventry Jets. The Nighthawks were able exceed all expectations of those outside of the organisation; culminating in a 7-3 record and a playoff berth for the fourth consecutive season. This season was ended by the current British Champions the London Warriors, in the semi-final of the Premiership. The Wolves first and only head coach, George Aguado, a Chicago native who coached numerous teams in Northern England and Wales, died in 2005. His passing was marked with a minute's silence at the opening game of the 2005 Challenge Cup between Cardiff Demons and Walney Central at Taff's Well, Wales.Davies S.

He has made contributions to mathematical physics and fundamental theoretical physics.  Life and work  Werner Nahm attended Gymnasium Philippinum Weilburg. After high school he studied from 1966 at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main and the Ludwig- Maximilians-Universität München, where he earned his diploma in physics in 1970. He received his doctorate in 1972 at the University of Bonn, his dissertation was titled Analytical solution of the statistical bootstrap model, where he was then to 1975 as a post-doctoral student. From 1976 to 1982 he was a scientist at CERN. From 1982 he was a Heisenberg fellow again at the University of Bonn. In 1986 he became associate professor at the University of California, Davis. 1989 to 2002 he was a full professor at the University of Bonn. Since 2002 he is one of three senior professors at the School of Theoretical Physics at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and since 2007 its director. He is a foreign member of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn. In the 1970s he worked with elementary theory, for example, bootstrap models (the subject of his dissertation\\"Analytical solutions of the statistical bootstrap model\\", Nuclear Physics B, volume 45, 1972) and the classification of graded Lie algebras, which are important in supersymmetric theories. After that, he worked mainly on the theory of magnetic monopoles, classification of supersymmetric models, conformal field theories and their algebraic classification, and classification of string models. The Nahm equations (1981) are named after him, used in (for example) for the description of monopoles in Yang–Mills theories, and the Nahm transform. In 1978 he showed that the maximum dimension of supersymmetric theories was d = 11.Nahm \\"Supersymmetries and their representations\\", Nuclear Physics B, Band 138, 1978, pp. 149–166. His predicted d = 11 supergravity theory was constructed shortly after by Eugène Cremmer, Bernard Julia and Joel Scherk. Since supersymmetric theories are now favoured in the context of Kaluza–Klein theories as candidates for unified field theories of elementary particles (M theory), Nahm also determined the maximum number of eligible space-time dimensions. Nahm also conducted research about the Mayan civilisation and their astronomy, for example, the role of Venus (and their phases) in terms of calendar prediction that was important for their planning of wars. In his Mayan research, he also worked with Linda Schele and Nikolai Grube and participated in the ongoing decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs.e.g. Grube, Nahm \\"A census of Xibalba – a complete inventory of way characters on Maya ceramics\\", in J. Kerr (Herausgeber) \\"The Maya Vase Book\\", V. 4, 1994.

The initial power plant with 15 MW installed capacity was expanded in the second phase about 80 MW to 95 MW in total, making the facility Turkey's biggest geothermal power plant. It is planned to expand the power plant in a third and fourth phase. History The power plant began its operation as a prototype system with the installation of a 500 kW turbine generator group in 1974. The facility generated electricity and distributed it to the households of villages in the vicinity for four years free of charge. In 1984, the state- owned company Elektrik Üretim A.Ş. (EÜAŞ) built a power plant with 17.4 MW installed capacity and put it into service. However, the geothermal power plant has produced 10 MW on average since its opening in 1984. In September 2008, Zorlu Energy Inc. (Zorlu Doğal Elektrik Üretim A.Ş.), a subsidiary of Zorlu Holding, acquired the facility from Ankara Doğal Elektrik Üretim ve Ticaret A.Ş. (ADÜAŞ) as part of a privatisation process with seven other hydroelectric power plants across the country. Zorlu Energy Inc. obtained the operating lease right for a runtime of 30 years. The company announced that they increased the actual power capacity from 6 MW to 14 MW in three months, and added that they plan to raise the capacity to 60 MW within three years in the next phase. With the initiative of the governmental Electrical Power Resources Survey and Development Administration (, EIE), a research project was started by Zorlu Petrogas Oil &Gas; group. After the oil and gas assets were sold to Transatlantic Petroleum, the project was carried out by Zorlu Geothermal Company in cooperation with the Hacettepe University and the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ) to increase the electricity production from the geothermal field. For the investment capital of the planned capacity increase, which amounts to US$230 million, the company received a credit from the banks Akbank and Garanti Bank in October 2010 with backpayment term of 12 years. In December 2011, the provincial administration allocated land needed for the construction site of the geothermal power plant expansion. The project forecast 575 GWh annual electrical energy generation, and a contribution to the country's economy at US$60 million yearly. The geothermal fluid would be used also in dry ice production and for heating in greenhouses and households in the villages around the power plant. The construction of the Kızıldere Geothermal Power Plant was completed in 2013, and it went into service. On September 29, 2013, a ceremonial opening took place in presence of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Minister Energy and Natural Resources Taner Yıldız, other high-ranked politicians and officials. The construction cost US$250 million. Kızıldere Geothermal Reservoir Kızıldere geothermal field is situated at the western branch of Büyük Menderes Graben within the limits of Denizli Province. It is Turkey's first and high-potential geothermal field explored for energy generation purposes. The first geological and geophysical surveys in the Kızıldere geothermal field began in 1965, and were carried out by the state-owned Turkish Mineral Research and Exploration Co. (MTA). The first geothermal reservoir was discovered in 1968 with a geothermal well drilled in depth, which had a source temperature of . In the years from 1968 to 1973, a total of 16 geothermal wells were drilled to depths ranging between . Six of the 17 geothermal wells were found feasible for electricity generation. Lithologically, the Kızıldere geothermal reservoir is surrounded by marble and limestone rocks containing carbon dioxide in high rate. The calcium carbonate dissolves from the rocks and later gets deposited as limescale on the instruments in the geothermal well and at the brink, such as demisters, heat exchangers and other locations, and this causes a drop in pressure. This results in decreased steam production, reduced efficiency and an increased probability of failure. Due to this fact, the power plant capacity reduced to 6 MW in the time before the privatization in 2008. To prevent calcium carbonate scaling in production wells, inhibitors are used. The geothermal fluid of Kızıldere reservoir has a Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) of 2.1 and Ryznar Stability Index (RSI) of 2.3 by a pH value of 9.3, making scaling take place very rapidly. The source temperature at the first reservoir is between . All the geothermal fluid used in the power plant is reinjected into the reservoir for the purpose of maintaining the sustainability of the source. Byproducts In addition to electricity generation, the geothermal fluid serves for processing of carbon dioxide gas as a byproduct, and this is used in dry ice production at two nearby plants. The total annual dry ice production in Kızıldere is 80,000 tons. Further applications are heating of greenhouse space and 2,500 households. Honors In June 2011, the International Energy and Environment Fair and Conference (ICCI) awarded Zorlu Energy Inc. the 2010 Energy Prize for its works on renewable energy, particularly in relation to the Kızıldere GEPP and Gökçedağ Wind Farm.

It had been founded by 1892 as one of the first civilian football clubs in Gibraltar. Although no longer in existence, up until 2014 it held the record for the most national championships in Gibraltar.  History  Football in Gibraltar was initially played only by members of the British military forces stationed there. Prince of Wales F.C. had been established by 1892 by Gibraltar citizens as one of the first football club for civilians as opposed to the military-only clubs that existed at the time. Two more civilian clubs were founded in 1893, Gibraltar F.C. and Jubilee F.C. Interest in the sport became strong enough that the Gibraltar Civilian Football Association was founded in 1895, and the first national football championship, the Merchants Cup, took place that year. In 1907, the Gibraltar Football League was established, beginning with eight teams, and Prince of Wales F.C., having already won several championships, were the inaugural league winners. Prince of Wales were national champions nineteen times, including seven of eight consecutive Gibraltar Football League seasons from 1920–21 to 1927–28. Their league championships record was eventually overtaken, however, and is now held by Lincoln Red Imps F.C., which as of 2016 has won 22 in all, including the past fourteen in a row. During the Second World War, most football played in Gibraltar focussed on matches between Prince of Wales F.C. and Britannia F.C. Prince of Wales F.C. won the Rock Cup, Gibraltar's national cup competition, in 1949. Their final League championship victory was in 1953. The club later disbanded.

It stars Emma Greenwell as a woman who goes in search of her missing sister, who has joined an isolated religious group.  Plot  After her sister Liz goes missing, Charlotte recruits Wayne, an ex-Marine, to help her locate Liz. Their search ends at a Pentecostal church headed by the charismatic Brother Billy. As Wayne becomes attracted to the church, details emerge that Liz may have been held against her will.  Cast  * Emma Greenwell as Charlotte * Joe Egender as Brother Billy * Brendan McCarthy as Wayne * Cameron Richardson as Sister Sheila * Roger Aaron Brown as Brother Cole * Donald Patrick Harvey as Brother Sherman  Production  Holy Ghost People was meant to be an even-handed portrayal of Pentecostal Christians, and the film was written to explore both the positive and negative aspects of faith. The documentary Holy Ghost People served as partial inspiration. The film was shot in Tennessee at Camp Nakanawa after the filmmakers scouted locations in several other states. In an interview, Altieri said he wanted to \\"get back to [his] roots and tell a gritty American tale.\\" Real snakes were used. Egender prepared for his role by watching videos of snake-handlers, whom he described as \\"charming and funny and charismatic. They are performers.\\"  Release  Holy Ghost People premiered at the 2013 SXSW, where it was picked up for distribution by XLrator. XLrator released it on video-on-demand on February 18, 2014, and it had a limited theatrical release three days later. For the theatrical release, the film was revised to address concerns raised in the festival screenings, such as excessive narration. The film is set for a Video on demand release on Hulu on 15 March 2015, as part of XLrator Media series Macabre.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 43% of seven critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 7.5/10. J. Hurtado of Twitch Film wrote, \\"A film is only as good as its ending, and Holy Ghost People really had me going up until the ludicrous finale that conjures memories of some other great films, just rehashed and with less style.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety also criticized the \\"underwhelming payoff\\", though he said the film is atmospheric and has a \\"promising buildup\\". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News called it \\"a relentless psychological thriller that features a solid script and even better acting.\\" Heather Wixson of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \\"an eerie exploration of power and religion\\" that is \\"an often hypnotic and surreal journey\\". Joshua Starnes of Shock Till You Drop rated it 6/10 stars and wrote, \\"The production is slick and the film is beautifully shot, but it’s missing that spark to become more.\\" Evan Dickson of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that the film is \\"a well shot piece of work with an intriguing premise and several amazing performances\\", but the ending \\"teeters dangerously close\\" to going off the rails. Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called it \\"easily [Altieri's and Flores'] most complete, cohesive, and compelling thriller yet.\\" Samuel Zimmerman of Fangoria rated it 2/5 stars and criticized the film's narration, which he states wrecks viewers' engagement with its redundancy. Inkoo Kang of the Los Angeles Times wrote the film \\"boasts great performances and urgent, intimate camera work\\" but \\"makes nasty beasts of the very people Adair strived to humanize\\". Kang concludes, \\"Long before its feeble, drawn-out ending, it's clear no miracle can cure this film's many frailties.\\"  References  External links   Category:2013 films Category:2013 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:Religious horror films Category:Films shot in Tennessee ","title":"Holy Ghost People (2013 film)"},{"id":"41563597","text":"Heliura valdiviai is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

With some 21,000 residents, it is renowned as a remarkable feat of urban planning. The satellite town of Sennestadt was created in the 1950s, in the heathlands and grasslands of the former municipality of Senne II, in accordance with the designs of the urban planner, Hans Bernhard Reichow, and it was primarily intended for post-war displaced persons and refugees. The town’s many distinctive urban planning features have attracted international attention.  History  The area in which the present district is situated was originally called Heepen-Senne (also Heepensenne or Heeper Senne) and it belonged to the County of Ravensberg. From 1346 onwards, it belonged to the County of Berg and, from 1647 onwards, to Brandenburg- Prussia. From 1813 onwards, Heepen-Senne was given the name \\"Senne II\\" and from 1816 onwards, it became a municipality in the District of Bielefeld. On 15 February 1956 the Regional Authority of Westphalia-Lippe, the District of Bielefeld and the Municipality of Senne II founded the company, Sennestadt GmbH, in order to realise the award-winning plans of the architect and urban planner, Hans Bernhard Reichow. The goal was to build a new satellite town \\"on the green meadows\\" that was primarily intended for post-war refugees and displaced persons. Reichow's design was based on the \\"organic urban planning\\" of which he was a proponent, a form of urban planning that was inspired by the laws of nature and which strove for a decentralised city with plenty of greenery that provided a decent standard of living.Hans Bernhard Reichow: Organische Baukunst. Georg Westermann, Braunschweig 1949 Sennestadt GmbH purchased the necessary site, measuring around 400 hectares, provided the financial resources, developed the site and sold it to investors and eager developers. The first homes were occupied in 1958 and the new satellite town was essentially completed by the mid-1960s. The Municipality of Senne II, which was part of the Administrative District of Brackwede, became the City of Sennestadt by charter dated 27 April 1965.Stephanie Reekers: Die Gebietsentwicklung der Kreise und Gemeinden Westfalens 1817–1967. Aschendorff, Münster (Westfalen) 1977, . In the context of the municipal reforms in Greater Bielefeld, Sennestadt – together with the rest of the District of Bielefeld – was amalgamated with the City of Bielefeld on 1 January 1973.Statistisches Bundesamt (Hrsg.): Historisches Gemeindeverzeichnis für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Namens-, Grenz- u. Schlüsselnummernänderungen bei Gemeinden, Kreisen u. Reg.-Bez. vom 27.5.1970 bis 31.12.1982. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart/Mainz 1983, , p. 320. In Sennestadt there was fierce opposition to the amalgamation. However, the legal objections to the local government reforms codified in the Bielefeld Act – which went all the way to the German Constitutional Court – were to no avail.  Urban planning, traffic and architecture  Pursuing his concept of \\"organic urban planning\\" and an \\"organic urban landscape\\", the planner and architect, Hans Bernhard Reichow, used the features of the landscape – the protected area of Bullerbachtal and a gravel pit that was created while the Autobahn was being built – in order to subdivide the new town, which held a German Grünes Kreuz (‘Green Cross’), into three boroughs: the Südstadt (‘South City’), the Weststadt (‘West City’) and the Oststadt (‘East City’). Sports fields were built on the site of the gravel pit, while a municipal park was built in Bullerbachtal.Hans B. Reichow: Planung und Bau der Sennestadt. In: Sennestadt – Geschichte einer Landschaft. E. Gundlach, Bielefeld 1968, p. 231f Reichow's requirement, that an urban model should incorporate all areas of life, tied in with the reformist concepts for society and living that characterised urban planning at the start of the 20th century. The buildings were supposed to be geared towards the rhythms of life and the modes of behaviour of their residents.Der Städtebau der Sennestadt. Eine Dokumentation. Sennestadtverein 1988, p. 5. Online In addition, the planners took the term \\"urban landscape\\" to mean a cityscape that neither closed itself off, as in the medieval city, nor sprawled outwards into the surrounding landscape, as in modern cities.Der Städtebau der Sennestadt. Eine Dokumentation. Sennestadtverein 1988, p. 17. In accordance with Reichow's plans, the road network should remain largely grade separated and resemble the veins of a leaf. Therefore, the roads were built like arcs each of which flows in a slight curve into the higher-ranking road. For security reasons, the pedestrian network should be completely separate from the traffic roads. Reichow envisaged arranging the right of way intuitively through the architecture of the roads and not via signposts, traffic lights or right-to- left schematics.[26] Later on, however, the main roads in Sennestadt were signposted like normal right-of-way streets.Anne Kaestner: Sennestadt brauchte keine Vorfahrtsschilder. In: Magazin H1. Universität Bielefeld, 2009, p. 26 f., retrieved on 20 May 2010. The locations of the town hall (Sennestadthaus), schools, churches, sports fields and shopping hubs should create correlations and make it easier for residents to get their bearings. At the same time the importance of these facilities should be specially accentuated by the architecture and the location.Der Städtebau der Sennestadt. Eine Dokumentation. Sennestadtverein 1988, p. 9. When building the residential homes, Reichow dispensed with a rigid linear plan. Instead, he placed the houses in a \\"dynamic motion and decentralisation\\".Hans B. Reichow: Planung und Bau der Sennestadt. In: Sennestadt – Geschichte einer Landschaft. E. Gundlach, Bielefeld 1968, p. 241 They are also deliberately different in terms of height and structural shape, in order to create a dynamic building zone. The design of the homes was supposed to do justice to that era's new rhythm of life, increased freedom and the residents' habitability requirements. Most homes in Sennestadt are arranged in such a way that the main living room, the balcony and at least one children's bedroom gets the afternoon sun so that the residents can enjoy the sun during their free time. According to Reichow, the rooms \\"meander between due South and due West, i.e. within a 90-degree angle.\\"Hans B. Reichow: Planung und Bau der Sennestadt. In: Sennestadt – Geschichte einer Landschaft. E. Gundlach, Bielefeld 1968, p. 242 Double balconies were avoided, in line with the human need for distance and privacy.ibidem In order to give the city an attractive shape, when building Sennestadt, Reichow and the municipal politicians made sure to incorporate Kunst am Bau (‘Art in Construction’).Sennestadtverein, online From 1971 to 1975, the Sennestadthaus – originally planned as the town hall – was incorporated into a nine-story building on a headland in the dammed up Sennestadt Pond. In accordance with Reichow's plans, the Sennestadthaus – together with the central square (now known as Reichowplatz) in front of it and the surrounding service buildings – was supposed to represent the \\"city's crowning glory\\". Sennestadt's amalgamation with Bielefeld in 1973 meant that it never became the town hall but rather the seat of a district office and a cultural centre with an event and concert hall.Neue Westfälische 9 November 2006; Der Städtebau der Sennestadt. Eine Dokumentation. Sennestadtverein 1988, p. 11 When Hans Bernhard Reichow died in 1974, a journalist also praised him for his cultural and historic role in Sennestadt: This city, which brought him worldwide success and was celebrated by thousands of people from around the globe as a prime example of German urban planning, had grown especially dear to his heart… In Sennestadt the urban planners … were able to realise his ideas for a \\"car-friendly city\\". This is also the place where he successfully combined residential homes with industrial settlement. Reichow... was not concerned with creating a dormitory town outside the gates of Bielefeld. Sennestadt was to be a vibrant city. He also succeeded in that regard…Neue Westfälische 9 May 1974, nach Sennestadt. Geschichte in Daten und Bildern 1969-1980, Bielefeld 1980, p. 24  Environmental aspects  From the outset, environmental aspects played an important role in planning Sennestadt. The Grünes Kreuz held by Bullerbachtal and West-Ost-Grünzug should not just retain the landscape within the city but also ensure the exchange of air and create attractive footpaths leading to the churches, schools and sports facilities. Covering the residential roads with greenery should also serve as soundproofing. Since the shape and arrangement of the residential homes also inc on the terrain, in terms of their shape and arrangement, they – together with the view into the Teutoburg woods – create quite varied green courtyards between the streets. In order to settle industry at the edge of Sennestadt, Reichow developed a \\"distance table\\" which, depending on the type and size of the business, should protect the residential areas from noise, dust and exhaust gases. When planning the shopping areas, the goal was to facilitate both arrival by car and modest shopping on foot.Der Städtebau der Sennestadt. Eine Dokumentation. Sennestadtverein 1988, p. 19, 23, 25, 27  Sennestadt as the \\"historic city centre\\"  In 2010 the Association of Federal Monument Conservators classified Sennestadt as a \\"historic city centre with special importance in terms of monuments\\", with the following statement: In the context of the project, in accordance with the terminology of UNTERMANN (2004), the term \\"historic city centre\\" is defined as a historic charter city. That also includes ... early modern and modern charter cities... In that respect, the historic city centre may also be amalgamated as a district of a larger city – as, for example in the case of Berlin-Spandau or Sennestadt.Städtebauliche Denkmalpflege: Historische Städte in Deutschland.

Reichow.ibid. p. 75 Historical photos of both the overall planning and a series of buildings created by Reichow and others, such as the Jesus Christ Church, the Thomas Morus Church, the Haus der Gesundheit (‘House of Health’), the Ostallee shopping area (= lower Elbeallee), GAGFAH multiple-occupancy houses, the hall of the East City School (= Adolf Reichwein School), Kreissparkasse bank (= Sparkasse bank), a high- rise block in the East Alley (= Elbe Alley) and several factory buildings, are recorded in the international architecture database, archINFORM.archinform.net 2014 In 2007 the Regional Authorities of Rhineland and Westphalia-Lippe produced a list of \\"important, federally significant cultural landscape areas\\". In the cultural landscape area 7.01 \\"Senne and its adjacent Teutoburg Forest\\" Sennestadt, along with a few other examples, is highlighted as \\"one of the few new urban establishments in Westphalia-Lippe with a complete infrastructure after the Second World War.\\" It was \\"a good example of the typical conception of architecture and urban planning during this period which was also discussed outside of Germany at the time.\\"Landschaftsverband Rheinland und Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe: Kulturlandschaftlicher Fachbeitrag zur Landesplanung in Nordrhein-Westfalen.

E-5-64-000-35  Buildings  The district’s traditional landmark, the Kreuzkirche – which dates back to 1894 – is in particular contrast to its modern landmark, the Sennestadthaus which was planned as the town hall and \\"crowning glory\\" of Sennestadt in 1969 and inaugurated in 1975. The District Administrative Office, adult education centre, youth art and music school, a technical college and Sennestadt GmbH moved into the building, instead of the mayor and the town council. First and foremost, the initially contentious building became the community centre of Sennestadt. The front building is especially striking, with its concert hall which is supported by pillars which stand in the water and the Kosmisches Raumelement (‘Cosmic Space Element’) sculpture by the sculptor, Bernhard Heiliger, on the exterior facade. In January and February 2007 Sennestadt GmbH had the facade of the Sennestadthaus, which used to be characterised by long balconies with concrete parapets, converted into a climate-friendly glass facade.  Art in public spaces  In the context of the series of exhibitions, \\"Contemporary Sculpture I, II, III and IV\\" which were held between 1983 and 2004, Sennestadt GmbH and Sennestadtverein e.V. acquired numerous sculptures which shape the townscape to this day.Sennestadtverein Online This series was continued with Vor Ort. Kunstprojekt Sennestadt (‘On site. Sennestadt Art Project’) which was held from May to October 2014, under the artistic management of Thomas Thiel, Director of the Bielefeld Art Society. The artists, David Adamo, Awst & Walther, Michael Beutler, Andreas Bunte, Christian Falsnaes, Manfred Pernice, Arne Schmitt and Kateřina Šedá, were invited to participate in this project by Sennestadtverein e.V. on behalf of the District of Sennestadt. In the works, sculptures and interventions in public areas that were created especially for this project, the artists examine both the history and the current circumstances of the location and its urban planning process which has been going on for decades already, as well as changes in society. The further development of Reichow's original concept plays an important role in an urban restructuring project that has been running since 2008. Vor Ort marks an interim stage of this transformation.Vor Ort. Kunstprojekt Sennestadt Online  Urban restructuring and urban renewal  Therefore, against the background of demographic trends, from the end of 2006 onwards Sennestadt GmbH made every effort to ensure that Bielefeld-Sennestadt was included in the Stadtumbau West ('Urban Redevelopment West') Federal development programme, which was also decided upon by Bielefeld City Council in 2008. Sennestadt GmbH set up an office for this purpose in the Sennestadt Pavilion.http://www.bielefeld.de: Stadtumbau Sennestadt In the context of several workshops, numerous goals and measures were defined jointly – together with many residents – for five areas of action: Townscape, Community & Neighbourhood, Living, Infrastructure and Commerce/Workspaces/Education. One significant measure in this regard is the improvement of public parks and the Sennestadt Pond. Since 2014 a Renewal Manager has been in charge of the dynamic urban renewal. Among other things, this involves the scheduled renewal of high-rise blocks and terraced houses, in close coordination with home owners, landlords and tenants.sennestadt- pavillon.de 2014 Online In addition, Sennestadt GmbH is developing a climate protection area which will be connected to the town centre by way of urban planning.

It is a novelty architecture type of a building, shaped to resemble a UFO. Opened in 1984, it was seen as one of the more modern bus stations of its kind in Poland at that particular time. History The building was constructed from 1975 to 1984, and opened on 20 July that year, two days before the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland. It was designed by Polish architect Edward Modrzejewski. The facility was seen as highly advanced in terms of its overall capacity, and quickly became a minor tourist attraction and one of the landmarks of Kielce. It was designed to accommodate 1,500 buses and the projected number of 24,000 passengers daily. The size of the complex is about . Recently the local government has declared the building to be a monument, and the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship monument curator has justified this decision by describing the building as \\"unique and novel example of People's Republic of Poland-era type of architecture\\" and \\"one of the most valuable architectural designs of the years of 1970s and 1980s in Poland, and a material document of this period\\". The fortunes of the building decreased in the 1990s, as post-communist Poland saw a rise in private car ownership, and a decreased interest in public transit. The building, formerly owned by the PKS company, has been privatized in the early 2010s. While the government authorities were interested in preserving the building, seen as an important landmark, its private owners were struggling to turn a profit out of it. As of the 21st century, the building became increasingly in need of renovation, and the owner, the PKS 2 company, was planning to replace it with a new construction at a different location, with the original building being heavily modified or replaced. A spokesman for the company has even declared that they are not willing to invest in renovating the building, and in fact are waiting for the building to collapse. This has caused criticism from individuals who see the building as part of modern Poland's cultural heritage, and demand that the design is not significantly altered. The city bought back the bus station at the end of March 2016. In September 2018, a major reconstruction project was started with the goal of almost completely rebuilding the station, but preserving the basic design and the distinctive shape of the building. The works are scheduled to finish in June 2020, with a planned cost of 68,7 million PLN, 9 million of which is to be provided by the city government (with the bulk of the rest of the funding coming from the European Union).

The lords of the kendras and trikonas (if not also owning a trikona; or associated with a trika-lord Lord of the 6th, the 8th, or the 12th house) associating with each other, or the lords of the 9th and 10th interchanging signs or fully aspecting each other, give rise to Raja yoga. Karakas Karaka (कारक), the word derived from the verb Kr meaning to do or make; literally it means that which makes or causes an event. Vatsyayana states –\\"When a thing is a participant in an action or when it is endowed with a special functional activity, it becomes a \\"karaka\\" (Vatsyayana’s Bhashya on Nayasutra II.i.16). Karakas remain constant under active paraphrase. According to Kiparsky and Staal they are the underlying relations of deep structure, belonging to a level intermediate between the level of semantic relations and the level of surface structure. And, Cardona states that things are karakas when they play certain roles in the accomplishment of an action (vyapara). The classification of the Karakas depends on the action denoted by particular items. This means action is 'that which is to be established' (saadhya) and the karakas are 'the establishers' (saadhakas). In Hindu astrology, the word, Karaka, is used to mean the 'significator' of a particular thing or event, and also causes that thing or event to occur. Each of the twelve bhavas or houses rule certain significances which are in turn ruled by a Karaka-graha i.e. planet particular to that house and significance, which planet is generally called the Karaka. The signification of the planets is known as Karakatva. The favourable or the unfavourable situation of the Karaka gives favourable or unfavourable results signified by it, and by the bhava and the bhava-lord. The effects of planets as Karakas ('functional benefics') or Akarakas ('functional malefics') or Marakas ('death-inflicting') are related to the Rasis or signs. Generally speaking each bhava has one or more Karakas or significators but it is bad for the bhava-lord or the bhava-karaka to occupy an evil trikasthana – the 6th, the 8th or the 12th from the lagna or from the concerned bhava. The Sun is the karaka of the lagna, the 9th and the 10th; Jupiter is the karaka of the 2nd, 5th, 10th and the 11th; Mars is the karaka of the 3rd and the 6th; the Moon is the karaka of the 4th; Mercury is the karaka of the 4th and the 10th; Saturn is the karaka of the 6th, 8th, 10th and the 12th and Venus is the karaka of the 7th house from the lagna; these are the Bhava-karakas. Yoga- karakas The Yoga-karaka is the planet which rules a Kendra ('Angular house') and a Trikona ('Trine') simultaneously. Thus, Saturn is the yoga-karaka for Taurus and Libra, Mars for Cancer and Leo, Venus for Capricorn and Aquarius sign. The Sun, Mercury and Jupiter do not attain this status which the two Lunar Nodes can if they are aspected or associated with the lord of a kendra or a trikona. Yoga-karakas are first rate functional benefics, they are particularly suited to benefit a person materially and in status. Kalyan Verma, citing Hari, states that the planet at the time of birth occupying its own sign, moolatrikona-rasi or exaltation sign in a kendra from the lagna becomes a yoga-karaka. Therefore, if for Cancer lagna the Moon and Jupiter are in the lagna, Saturn is in the 4th and the Sun and Mars combine in the 10th house, all these named planets become mutual yoga-karakas. The planet which is situated in its exaltation sign, friendly sign and in its own navamsa, and the Sun exalted in the 10th house become special Raja yoga-karakas (Saravali St.VI.1-6). Impact According to Jataka Parijata, the designated Karakas of the 10th house i.e. of the Karmasthana, are a) Jupiter, which is the natural significator of wealth, body and life; b) the Sun, the natural significator of energy, will-power, authority and the Atman; c) Mercury, the natural significator of intellect, education, ability to write and business and d) Saturn, the natural significator of labour and hard-work. Exalted planets if they are combust or retrograde or in neecha or inimical navamsa can even produce evil results. The planet which is in its exaltation sign in the rasi- chart but in its neecha-navamsa produces its bad results very soon; a planet situated in its debilitation sign in the rasi-chart but in its uccha-nvamsa proves to be auspicious but the occupation of one’s own navamsa is superior to the occupation of the uccha-navamsa. Exalted planets confer better results if they are situated alone in their respective signs of exaltation, they become constrained in the presence of other planets that are not their 'dispositors'. The kendras and the trikonas not occupied by a Tara-graha indicate a turbulent life. If benefic planets and malefic planets occupy the kendras, and the Moon is either conjoined with Saturn or is in a navamsa owned by Saturn or if all three natural benefics along with the Moon, even if occupying own, friendly or exaltation signs, occupy inimical or neecha navamsas and Saturn is in the lagna cause yoga which makes one lead a very miserable life. Janardan Harji in his Mansagari reiterates that the presence of Karaka-grahas will raise even a lowly-born to the status of a minister, the one born in a royal family will certainly be crowned a king, and adds that a benefic planet situated in the 2nd house from the Sun and the rest occupying the kendras give long-lasting riches and if the lords of the lagna and the Chandra-lagna along with Jupiter occupy the 10th house one becomes very fortunate or if Jupiter is in the lagna, Venus in the 4th, Mercury in the 7th and Mars is situated in the 10th house a person will be very fortunate, very wealthy and very generous.

Read here. Life Johnstone was born probably on 1 August 1749, in the horse-barracks in Kilkenny, where his father, a quartermaster in a dragoon regiment, was then quartered. He joined a cavalry regiment, and won some reputation among his comrades for his sweet tenor voice. It is said that on his discharge his colonel recommended him for his singing in a letter to Thomas Ryder, manager of the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. Here in any case Johnstone made his first stage appearance, about 1773, as Lionel in Lionel and Clarissa (Charles Dibdin and Isaac Bickerstaffe). He was engaged for three years, and remained from seven to ten years on the Irish stage, singing principal tenor parts.See also: 'Biographical Sketch of Mr Johnstone (with a Portrait)', The Monthly Mirror: reflecting men and manners for April 1802, pp. 226–30 Read here: 'Obituary: Mr Johnstone, Gentleman's Magazine 2 March (for February) 1829, pp. 183–84. Read here. The London stage On the recommendation of Charles Macklin, Johnstone and his wife were engaged by Thomas Harris at Covent Garden Theatre for three years, and Johnstone was well received on his début as Lionel on 2 October 1783. =William Shield operas= His association with the operas of William Shield commenced early. He appeared (as Dermott) with John Edwin and Charles Bannister in The Poor Soldier (John O'Keeffe's words) in 1783:Margaret Ross Griffel, Operas in English: A Dictionary Revised Edition (Scarecrow Press, 2012), p. 387. in 1784 in Shield's Robin Hood, his duet with Charles Bannister was 'unanimously encored', and later that year he sang \\"Let fame sound the trumpet\\" in Shield's Fontainblau with great success: he and Bannister sang airs and duets at a dinner with Shield a few days afterwards.W. Parke, Musical Memoirs (Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley, London 1830), Vol. 1, pp. 33, 44–45. In The Choleric Fathers (1785), (a Shield opera to a Thomas Holcroft libretto) he was Don Fernando in a cast led by John Quick.Griffel, Operas in English, p. 90. Shield's 1786 collaboration with O'Keeffe, Love in a Camp saw him as Captain Patrick, and Love and War (1787) (a Robert Jephson script), again with Quick, gave him Captain Farquar.Griffel, Operas in English, pp. 287, 286. In The Farmer (1787) Johnstone was Valentine to Charles Bannister's Farmer Blackberry,Griffel, Operas in English, p. 167. and in The Highland Reel (1788) he was Sandy to Bannister's Serjeant Jack:Griffel, Operas in English, p. 224. in 1790 he was Colonel Lefort to Bannister's Peter I in The Czar.Griffel, Operas in English, p. 110. All three were O'Keeffe texts set by Shield. 1790 also saw Johnstone as Raymond to Bannister's Duran in Shield's The Crusade to a Frederic Reynolds script.Griffel, Operas in English, p. 107. In the 1791 premiere of The Woodman (text by Dudley), with Quick, Bannister, Incledon and Mrs Martyr, he played Captain O'Donnel 'with great vivacity and spirit, and gave his Irish ballad with peculiar felicity', though when recalled it was to watch mutely while Incledon gave encores.'An Account of the new comedy called The Woodman,' The Lady's Magazine Vol 22 (for 1791), (GGJ and J Robinson, London), pp. 151–53. He was Sergeant of Grenadiers in To Arms! in 1793, Dorimund in Travellers in Switzerland in 1794,Griffel, Operas in English, pp. 497, 503. and in 1795, in the afterpiece The Irish Mimic, or Blunders at Brighton (Shield and O'Keeffe) as Parrot he played an Irish character who failed completely to mimic certain birds and animals (but sang beautifully).Parke, Musical Memoirs, Vol. 1, p. 203; Griffel, Operas in English, p. 241. Johnstone and William Shield, Charles Incledon, Charles Dignum, Charles Bannister, Charles Ashley and William Parke (oboeist) in 1793 formed themselves into 'The Glee Club', a set which met on Sunday evenings during the season at the Garrick's Head Coffee House in Bow Street, once a fortnight, for singing among themselves and dining together. A project to erect a bust to Dr Thomas Arne, which this group proposed to fund by charitable performances, was vetoed by the management of Covent Garden.W. Parke, Musical Memoirs (Richard Bentley, London 1830), p. 175-79. It is told that Johnstone was a regular drinking companion of Charles Incledon's at 'a public house of the lowest class', The Brown Bear in Bow Street.W. Parke, Musical Memoirs Vol 1, p. 333. Incledon was a prodigious boozer. =Samuel Arnold and others= Johnstone was also associated with the operas of Samuel Arnold, and his appearance in 1789 performances of Inkle and Yarico (1787), supporting Mrs Billington, is described by Parke.Parke, Musical Memoirs, Vol. 1, p. 114. He featured in The Surrender of Calais (text by George Colman the younger) at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, in 1791,Griffel, Operas in English, p. 475. and was Harry Furnace in Warner's The Armourer at Covent Garden in 1793.Griffel, Operas in English, p. 28. He appeared (as Captain O'Leary) with Incledon in William Reeve's British Fortitude and Hibernian Friendship in 1794,Griffel, Operas in English, p. 69. and was O'Curragh in Arnold's Zorinski (1795) and Captain Macgallaher in his Bannian Day (1796),Griffel, Operas in English, pp. 556, 37. again at the Haymarket. Britain's Brave Tars!, a one-act farce by Thomas Attwood to an O'Keeffe text, had Incledon as Lieutenant Tafferel and Johnstone as Pat Plunket (who sang \\"Brave Betty was a maiden\\") in the 1797 Covent Garden premiere.Griffel, Operas in English, p. 68. In 1798 he was The Bard in the premiere of Arnold's Cambro-Britons at the Haymarket.Griffel, Operas in English, p. 75. Until 1803 he remained at Covent Garden, with occasional summer seasons at the Haymarket Theatre. He performed Macheath in the Beggar's Opera, and once appeared as Lucy at the Haymarket in a production with John Bannister, when the male and female parts were reversed. He took various other operatic tenor leads: however his singing voice did not wear well, and he gradually abandoned operatic parts. Johnstone specialised in Irish characters in comic drama as well as in the opera. He was originally encouraged to this by Macklin, who marked him out for the role of Sir Callaghan O'Brallachan in Love à-la-Mode. This was a turning-point in the drama, because John Moody was past his best and William EganAdolphus must refer to William Egan the younger, 1762–1822, see P.H. Highfill, K.A. Burnim and E.A.

He became known as \\"Irish\\" Johnstone, and, on his visiting Dublin in 1803, he was welcomed as a representative of authentic Irishmen on the stage. =Move to Drury Lane, 1803= Johnstone joined Joseph George Holman's protest against the new regulations at Covent Garden Theatre, and accepted an engagement at Drury Lane in 1803, where he often shared the stage with John Bannister. He appeared for the first time onstage there on 20 September 1803 as Murtoch Delany (Irishman in London, by William Macready the elder). In the same season he played Sergeant Armagh in Cobb's The Wife of Two Husbands, and Brian O'Bradleigh in Allingham's Hearts of Oak. He appeared as Teague in T. Knight's The Honest Thieves at the final benefit for Charles Bannister in 1804.Adolphus, Memoirs of John Bannister Vol. 2, 107–10, 122–24. He was an Irish interpreter in Cherry's The Travellers in January 1806. He acted at Drury Lane for the rest of his career, though he returned to Covent Garden as Sir Callaghan on the occasion of Charles Mathews's benefit, 8 June 1814, and again in 1820. Last years At Covent Garden Johnstone's benefit and last appearance (as Brulgruddery) took place on 28 June 1820. He bade farewell to the stage at Liverpool in August, but appeared once again at a charity performance at Drury Lane on 18 May 1822. Johnstone died at his house in Tavistock Row, Covent Garden, on 26 December 1828, and was buried in a vault in the eastern angle of St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden. Family Johnstone married, first, Ann Maria, the daughter of Colonel Poitier, governor of Kilmainham gaol; she was an operatic singer, and instructed him in music, but they separated a few months after marriage. For a time Sarah Maria Wilson was his mistress. Secondly, he married Ann Bolton, the daughter of a wine merchant, with whom he eloped. Their only daughter Susan Johnstone was an actress who married James William Wallack. Johnstone left the bulk of his property (£12,000) in trust to her children. Susan's eldest son was John Johnstone Wallack.

It is significant for its association with Bruce Catton (an alumnus of the Academy and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian), who lived there when his father was president of Benzonia Academy. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History The village of Benzonia was founded as an educational colony in 1858 by the Reverend Charles E. Bailey and four families from Oberlin, Ohio. They immediately set about building an educational institution, holding classes beginning in 1860. They constructed a two-story frame building and chartered the community school, Grand Traverse College, in 1863. Within five years, the building burned, and the school took over a three-story frame building, dubbing it \\"East Hall.\\" This was the only building used by the college for a number of years, until the 1890s when a new building was constructed, and East Hall was turned into the girl's dormitory, dining room, and president's quarters. In 1891, the school was reorganized as Benzonia College; in 1900 the school became Benzonia Academy. In 1906, George Catton became president of Benzonia Academy. He and his family, including his son Bruce Catton (a future alumnus of the Academy and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian) lived in East Hall, the girls' dormitory. In early 1909, East Hall was destroyed by fire. Mills Cottage was constructed that year as a replacement for East Hall. It was named for the Rev. Harlow S. Mills, who led the local Congregationalist congregation from 1896 to 1916 and made substantial contributions to the construction of the building in honor of his late wife. The cottage included the girls' dormitory, the dining room, and living quarters for the Academy headmaster. In 1918, Benzonia Academy closed its doors due to financial difficulties. In 1925, when it became clear that the Academy would not reopen, Mills Cottage was deeded to the Benzonia Congregational Church. The building was renovated to include an auditorium on the upper level and a meeting space in the lower level. The Benzonia Public Library leased the middle floor. During the 1930s, Benzonia High School used the top floor as a gymnasium, theater, and dance floor. Later, other community groups used the space for plays, parties, and meetings. During World War II Mills House was used to house women of the Woman's Land Army of America. Later, the top floor was closed due to safety concerns. However, the Benzonia Library still operated out of the building, and the community still used the meeting space on the first floor. In the 1990s, the building was renovated to include a full kitchen and new restrooms. In 2002, the Mills Community House Association was formed, and the building was deeded to them. In 2008, additional renovations made it possible to reopen the top floor, which now hosts performances by the Benzie County Players performances, musical concerts, historical lectures, and other gatherings. It is the only remaining building from Benzonia Academy. Description Mills Cottage, 1913 Mills Cottage is a rectangular, 2-1/2 story brick structure on a stone foundation with a steeply pitched hip roof having wide eaves and exposed rafters. The center section is fronted by a wide porch having Tuscan columns, and the roof is punctuated in the center by a hip roof dormer holding four windows. The end sections, similarly roofed, project slightly. Inside, an auditorium is on the top floor, and the library takes up the main floor.

The distillery produces Beenleigh Rum. It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 March 2004.  History  Beenleigh Rum Distillery, circa 1912 The Beenleigh Rum Distillery on the banks of the Albert River was licensed in 1884 and utilised molasses from sugar grown and crushed in the area. The town of Beenleigh developed consequent to the growth of sugar related industries in the area and took its name from the plantation that the preceded the establishment of the distillery. Moreton Bay penal colony commandant Captain Patrick Logan explored the area around the Logan and Albert Rivers in 1826. Timbergetters in search of cedar and hardwoods moved into the district around 1840, but the first European settlers took up land in 1864 under the Sugar and Coffee regulations, a government scheme to encourage the growing of these potentially valuable crops in the new colony of Queensland. Leases of between were available for three years with an option to purchase, in order to encourage the establishment of plantations. 39 leases were granted in the first months of the scheme's operation of which 10 were in the Logan area, and at all of which it was intended to grow sugar. Sugar cane had been first brought to Australia in 1788 but subsequent plantings at Sydney, Port Macquarie and Norfolk Island failed to be commercially viable. Captain Louis Hope grew a cane crop successfully in Ormiston in Queensland in 1862. By 1864 the first commercial sugar mill in Australia had been established by him at Ormiston and interest in growing sugar cane spread rapidly. By 1867 an estimated were under cane in the Brisbane area and by the end of the decade, cane had also been successfully established further north at Maryborough, Mackay and Bundaberg, where the warmer climate proved more suitable, and sugar was established as a major commercial crop in Queensland. An area of land between the Albert and Logan Rivers was planted with cane in 1865 by the partnership of Francis Gooding and John Davy. The brothers-in-law had arrived in Brisbane from Devon, England, in 1862 and named their new plantation \\"Beenleigh\\" after their home in England. By 1866 their plantation was productive and in 1868, the Inspector of Distilleries reported that the Logan area had under cultivation and a still was in the course of erection at \\"Malungmovel\\", George Board's plantation. The production of rum was encouraged by the Queensland Government as it brought in revenue from taxes and was a popular commodity, being easier to keep and transport than beer or wines in an era when transport was slow. A mobile distillery also served the numerous plantations along the rivers. This was the steam operated \\"Walrus\\", a boat which was built at Cleveland in 1864 as a sailing vessel, then sold in 1869 to James Stewart who converted it to steam and installed a still. A license to operate as a floating distillery was reluctantly granted on 14 April 1869 by the Inspector of Distilleries, although he deemed the boat unsuitable for the purpose, as there was then no other licensed distillery in the area. The boat then operated as the Pioneer Floating Sugar Mill. Its licence was not renewed in 1872 as it did not fulfil the requirement to carry cane-crushing equipment and acted solely as a distillery, producing rum from molasses. This is the thick syrup remaining after cane juice has been crystallised by boiling to produce sugar. Rum is produced from this by-product by adding water and yeast and fermenting the mixture. This is then boiled and the alcohol vapour separated out by distillation, the condensate being collected, perhaps charcoal filtered, and stored in casks to mature. By 1869 Davy and Gooding had under cane and were constructing a sugar mill, which was in operation by the following year. The boom in sugar in the region in the 1870s led to the rapid development of the nearby township that took its name from the Beenleigh plantation. By 1876 this was described by Bailliere's Gazetteer as a provincial centre serving an area with nine sugar mills and two distilleries within six kilometres of the township. After the 'Walrus's' license was withdrawn it is said to have carried on its operations illegally for some years. In 1883 the boat was beached on the banks of the Albert River and Francis Gooding purchased its still, obtaining a distillery licence in June 1884. The price of sugar fell in 1884 and this may have had some bearing on the decision to include distilling in the partnership's operations The Beenleigh distillery had of rum on hand by 31 March 1885. The Post Office Directory for that year lists three distilleries in the area: Ageston, Davy and Gooding, and the Loganholme Sugar Company. Many small plantations in the area failed in the 1880s due also to frosts, disease and soil exhaustion. The river flats in the Logan River area where many plantations had been located for ease of transport were also prone to flooding. In 1887 a flood washed the whole Davy and Gooding distillery, including a large stock of rum, down the river. However, it was soon re-established after the purchase of a still, said to be from Coulderey's Ageston distillery at Rocky Point. The Logansholme plant closed at this time, though Ageston kept going until the early 1890s. In 1890 a brick spirit store was constructed at Beenleigh and the building appears to have been built in two stages, though the construction is similar. The Beenleigh Sugar Mill continued in operation as well as the distillery. In 1895, the business appears in the Queensland Post Office Directory as the Albert River Milling and Distillery Co with Albert Kleinschmidt as the manager. In the 1890s milling had become a more specialised process due to technical advances and many of the smaller plantations closed following the recession of this era. The Beenleigh distillery appears to have prospered, however, and in 1899 Beenleigh rum won a gold medal at the London International Fair. By then the brand was well known and sold as far away as Cairns. 1904, The Albert River Milling and Distillery Co Limited purchased the land on which the distillery was located and in 1908, the Beenleigh Distillery was listed separately to the mill. In 1912, a new title was issued for the land in the name of Albert Kleinschmidt and in 1917 Thomas Brown and Sons Ltd purchased the business, which operated as the Beenleigh Rum Distillery Pty Ltd. Browns made many changes including the installation of eight large kauri pine vats, remodelling and enlarging the stills and upgrading other machinery. They also used railway transport to bring in molasses from the Isis district, Bingera, Gin Gin and Woongalba. In 1936 the distillery was described as having its own landing and unloading wharf, a complete power plant, cooper's shop and all necessary facilities to make it a self-contained producer of rum. A flood in 1947 washed away the pump house and a lavatory building. In 1969 the distillery ceased production due to falling demand. However, in 1972 Mervyn Davy and his two sons purchased the distillery and production resumed. The bottling plant was modernised and also bottled whisky, brandy, gin, vodka and ouzo. A new warehouse, office block and showroom were built. The distillery was flooded in 1974 when all records were lost. Applications were lodged with the Council for a new vat store, bottle store and two \\"houses\\", only one of which appears to have been constructed. At that time there were two brick warehouses along the road, which are thought to have been constructed in the late 1950s or 1960s. In 1975 the buildings on site comprised the still house, tanks, a brick store and bottling room, an office, two bulk stores and a cellar. A bulk store was proposed. In 1980 the Moran family acquired the complex. They purchased additional land adjacent to the distillery, which underwent major redevelopment and renovation works. A dam was constructed beside the distillery on the site of an earlier dam, which had existed since at least 1908. The floor of the spirit store was excavated and two higher sections were inserted into the roof of the still house, which was painted the bright red it is now. The fermentation vats were removed, but old timber vats were retained, as was the relocated copper still. Rum may be light or darkened by the presence of caramels. The darker rums are usually distilled in \\"pot stills\\", which are considered to be less efficient than column distillation, retaining more flavour elements, though this may be desirable in the case of sprits such as rum or whisky, where such elements provide a distinctive character. Rums may also be produced by blending pot and column distilled rums. The pot still at Beenleigh has been in use since 1887, though at least parts of it may be much earlier. Modern continuous distillation columns were added to the still house and new fermentation vats were installed with metal walkways constructed to access their upper levels. The work was completed in 1981. A small museum was created, the exhibits mainly comprising photographs and scale models. At least one timber building was demolished in this development, as were the decorative 19th century gateposts at the main entrance. In 1984 Tarac Industries acquired a controlling interest in the complex, which was modified and extended in a \\"massive redevelopment\\". The license of the Twin River Tavern at Eagleby was transferred to the new tavern. The complex had private and public bars, bistros, a restaurant, TAB, drive-in bottle shop, liquor barn, craft shop and other facilities. By 1987 it was referred to as the Beenleigh Distillery and Moran's Wharf complex and had a tourist park license. Newspapers refer to plans to \\"update the technology and methods\\". In 1988 the tavern complex was sold, the distillery being retained by Tarac. A number of distillery buildings were constructed in the 1990s including a large machinery canopy (1992), a warehouse and bottling hall and offices (1994). At this time a warehouse was demolished and in 1996 a new warehouse was added. In 2003 the brand name and existing supplies of bulk spirits were sold to Vok Beverages. A new Visitors Centre was built on site from an existing building. Remnants of Cyclone Debbie flooded the Beenleigh area in March of 2017. As a result of these rising waters, the Beenleigh Distillery was affected. Water breached the main distillery building affecting the electrical cabling inside and stopping production for 6 months.  Description  The Beenleigh Rum distillery is located on an area of level ground on the bank of the Albert River at Eagleby. It is surrounded by open land and an area between the distillery and the river has been landscaped and has plantings of palm trees. The modern buildings are grouped towards the entrance and are linked by a bitumen-paved area. There is a large dam located next to the still house and spirit store. Most of the buildings on site have been built in the last two decades and are constructed of brick and modern metal sheeting. These comprise offices, storerooms, and a bottling plant. There are also modern storage tanks and walkways. There is a small museum in one of the brick stores. The main distillery building, comprising a brick and timber still house and attached brick spirit stores is the oldest building on site. The spirit store is composed of two joined English bond brick buildings on concrete footings and with modern concrete floors. They have separate hipped roofs clad with corrugated metal sheeting and the interior of the roof of the smaller building has battens suitable for shingles. Both sections have high square windows fitted with iron bars and timber lintels. Large timber vats on masonry stands are still in place in both sections of the store. The still house is built of timber with sections of wall in English bond brick and has a concrete floor. The building is clad in weatherboard over vertical studs and has timber trusses and posts. Ventilation panels have been created below the roof and at waist height by omitting sections of cladding. At the end of the building nearest the river two new higher sections have been inserted creating a tower like effect. This new section has steel trusses and has large square windows towards the river. The distillery is equipped with modern distilling equipment including fermenting vats and column stills; however, the copper pot still remains. The upper levels of the still house are accessed by modern steel stairs and decking. To the rear of the distillery, a canopy has been erected over a steam boiler of unknown date. Beside the distillery is a small rectangular building clad in weatherboard, which has a gabled low- pitched roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting. It is used as a workshop and for some general storage. It also has a two bay garage with roller doors attached.  Heritage listing  Beenleigh Rum Distillery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 March 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The sugar industry has been of great importance to the development of Queensland for its contribution to the economy and to the pattern of European settlement. The Logan area was the site of some of the earliest sugar plantations, mills and distilleries in Queensland. The industry in the area was distinguished from that developing further north by being on a small scale, based on farms and private mills, rather than on large central mills. The Beenleigh Rum Distillery was, until very recently, the oldest working distillery in Queensland. The main distillery buildings are evidence for a major early industrial enterprise in the Logan area, which is linked with an important phase in the development of the sugar industry in Queensland. The Beenleigh plantation, mill and distillery business was a key factor in the development of the town of Beenleigh and the surrounding area. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Beenleigh rum distillery is a rare survivor of the early sugar industry in south east Queensland and preserves a 19th-century copper pot still which was part of the original equipment of the distillery. It is thought to be the earliest still of this type in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The distillery complex, particularly the main still house building, is a landmark which stands out from the river flats on which it is built and can readily be seen from the Pacific Highway and from the Albert River. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Beenleigh distillery is a focus of memory for many people who have worked there or whose forebears have worked there and it is closely associated with the identity of the area by the local community.

The Pelinaio mountain, at is the highest mountain in Chios and one of the highest in the Aegean sea. How this village took its name is not certain. The most common explanation is that it took its name from the ancient game amada (modern Greek: Αμάδα), where each participant had a small stone and within a specific perimeter they tried to hit the others’ stones. The contemporary game of Amada is said to be like billiards or bowling.  Economy  The most common occupation for the inhabitants is farming.

It lies within the designated Ingleborough Site of Special Scientific Interest. Description A climb at the base of the grassy shakehole drops into a stream passage.

They were disappointed to find that after the cave terminated in a low water-filled crawl, hence its name. The passages at the bottom, leading from Hensler's Master Cave to the chamber where the last pitch of Disappointment Pot enters the system were found by Eric Hensler in 1937 when he discovered over of passage in Gaping Gill on a solo trip. In 1944 Bob Leakey stripped naked and dived through the flooded passage at the end of Disappointment Pot which had previously stopped Simpson to find airspace where he could stand. He was then able to demolish a small dam of consolidated stones to lower the water level. This enabled the cave to be explored to the bottom.

As a recent graduate (1824) of Trinity College, Dublin, he was a curate in 1825 at Parwich and Alsop en le Dale in Derbyshire. In 1827 he was in Edgeworthstown, County Longford. Trinity Church, Limerick, built 1834 with funds raised by Edward Newenham Hoare Around 1830, Hoare was curate at St. John's, Limerick. He raised funds in England and Scotland, in 1834, to erect a church for the parish of St. Lawrence, allowing for the wishes of Edmund Pery, 1st Earl of Limerick, which meant that the church would be a chapel, attached to a charity, in this case an Asylum for Blind Females.John Thomas Waller, A Short Account of the Origins of Trinity Church and St. Michael's Church in the City of Limerick, (PDF) The chapel was built that year, to a design by Joseph Fogarty. Hoare was made Rector of St Lawrence, Limerick in 1835, and Archdeacon of Ardfert in 1836. He became a chaplain in 1839 to Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

The Christian Herald Hoare was noted as an evangelical preacher, and edited The Christian Herald, a prophetical journal that appeared from 1830 to 1835, and was published in Dublin. Its editorial line was historicist and premillennialist. It reported in detail on the first two prophetic conferences at Powerscourt House, and ran some articles by John Nelson Darby. A sequel publication, under the same title, was later started by Michael Paget Baxter. The attitude of The Christian Herald to eschatology had something in common with other periodicals, Churchman's Monthly Review, and The Quarterly Journal of Prophecy, and the views of Thomas Nolan (1809–1882). The central idea was that the personal reign of Christ would be prolonged indefinitely. Works Hoare wrote numerous sermons; and other works including: *Practical Observations on Church Reform, the Tithe Question and National Education in Ireland (1838) *The Tendency of the Principles advocated in the Tracts for the Times considered (1841).

Luo Menghong's life and mysticism An orphan since youth, Luo Qing was raised by relatives and became a soldier.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 At the age of twenty-eight, for his distressful sentiment of forlornness,Seiwert, 2003. p. 446 he went on a spiritual quest and studied with several teachers,Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 although he was unable to establish permanent relationships.Seiwert, 2003. p. 446 Only at the age of forty, apparently without a direct guidance of a teacher,Seiwert, 2003. p. 446 he reached enlightenment:Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 awareness to be united with the absolute principle of reality.Seiwert, 2003. p. 446 He began gathering disciples and wrote the Wubuliuce (\\"Five Instructions in Six Books\\"), first printed in 1527.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 Written in a lucid vernacular language, Luo's texts are characterised by an egalitarian tone, erasing differences between lay and clergy, upper and lower classes, and men and women.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 Drawing on his own experience as an orphan, Luo describes the human condition of being lost and in search of one's true home and refuge.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 He speaks of the final destination that is the absolute principle of being, variously representing it through abstract symbols.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 An experience similar to that of Luo can be found in the biography of Lin Zhao'en, the founder of the Sanyi teaching.Seiwert, 2003. p. 448 By the 17th century the teachings of Luo combined with other folk beliefs, namely Maitreyan millenarianism and the folk mother goddess.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 In the new mythological representation of Luo's enlightenment, humans are children of the primordial goddess.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 Confused by the desires of the material world, they have forgotten their celestial origin, and so the Mother sends emissaries to remind her children the possibility of return to the original condition in the Three Suns, or stages of the world.Nadeau, 2012. p. 231 The three enlightened beings are Dipankara, Gautama and Maitreya the future one. Doctrine=God and the Goddess= In the theology of Luoist sects the absolute principle of the universe is the central focus of meaning and worship. In the original writings of Luo it is represented as \\"True Void\\" (真空 Zhēnkōng).Seiwert, 2003. p. 387 Since the 17th century the prevalent representation became a goddess, the Unborn Venerable Mother (無生老母 Wúshēng Lǎomǔ).Seiwert, 2003. p. 331, p. 444 Other symbols of the source of being, also common to other traditions, are Wújí (the \\"Unlimited\\"), Zhēn (真 \\"Truth\\", \\"True Reality\\"), Gǔfú (古佛 \\"Ancient Awakened\\").Seiwert, 2003. p. 387 These symbols are commonly combined together in sect's precious scrolls to express the impersonal absolute origin according to the tastes of different social groups.Seiwert, 2003. p. 387 The absolute principle is also associated to the Big Dipper asterism.Seiwert, 2003. p. 387 Luo Menghong's original revelation emphasises the impersonal representation of the absolute.Seiwert, 2003. p. 387 However, he also talks of Holy Patriarch of the Unlimited (无极圣祖 Wújí Shèngzǔ)Seiwert, 2003. p. 221 and of the mother as a duality, the Eternal Parents (無生父母 Wúshēng Fùmǔ).Seiwert, 2003. p. 444 Patriarch Luo is considered an incarnation of the universal God by his followers.Seiwert, 2003. p. 387 =Eschatology= The Three Suns (三阳 sānyáng) eschatological doctrine places itself in a tradition flourishing at least since the Ming dynasty.Seiwert, 2003. p. 326 It can be traced back to a Hunyuan Taoist school named after the concept of hunyuan (\\"original undetermined\\") that existed before hundun (\\"coalesced undetermined\\") and is the beginning of primordial qi (yuanqi) according to some Taoist cosmologies.Seiwert, 2003. p. 326 Although originally Taoist, these concepts became part of the folk tradition and were incorporated into the sects.Seiwert, 2003. p. 327 In the earliest sects of the Ming period, the Lord of the Original Undetermined (混元主 Hùnyuánzhǔ) represents the origin of the universe developing through three stages, yang, or cosmic periods.Seiwert, 2003. p. 327 In most sect scriptures, these three periods are known as Green Sun (qingyang), Red Sun (hongyang) and White Sun (baiyang).Seiwert, 2003. p. 327 They are known by other names due to oral transmission of the teaching.Seiwert, 2003. p. 327 The earliest written evidence of this doctrine can be found in the Huangji jieguo baojuan, published in 1430.Seiwert, 2003. p. 328 In this text the three stages are already associated to the three buddhas Dipankara, Gautama and Maitreya.Seiwert, 2003. p. 328 =Practice and salvation= In Luoist writings the symbol of wúshēng (無生 \\"unborn\\") means the state of \\"no birth and no death\\" that gives enlightenment.Seiwert, 2003. p. 390 The Unborn Venerable Mother or the Holy Patriarch of the Unlimited are personifications of this state.Seiwert, 2003. p. 390 In Luoist traditions, as written for example in the \\"Book of the Dragon Flower\\" (Longhuajing), meditation has a crucial role in the path to salvation, that corresponds to the \\"return to the mother\\" or the wusheng state.Seiwert, 2003. p. 390 Salvation is the realisation of one's true nature.Seiwert, 2003. p. 390 See also * Chinese salvationist religions * Dacheng teaching of Mount Jizu * Maitreya teachings * Xiantiandao * Sanyi teaching FootnotesReferencesSources * Hubert Michael Seiwert.

In his autobiography My Life in Porn, Bobby Blake devoted a whole chapter to the film, explaining some of his motives and describing it as \\"an expensive movie and the most powerful movie of my life\\", adding, \\"It's also one of the most controversial adult films ever made, and that's what I wanted it to be - I had decided this was to be my last film, and I wanted to take it to the limit.\\"My Life in Porn: The Bobby Blake Story - \\"Niggas' Revenge\\" chapter  Synopsis  Three neo-Nazi supremacists (Dallas Chalmers and his white \\"posse\\" Chane Adams and Bud Cockerham) go to the residence of the Blakes (Bobby Blake and his brother Chris Blake and Flex-Deon Blake) and shout racial slurs, harassing and bullying them in an attempt to get them to leave the neighborhood. However, the muscular black neighbors have finally had enough and get their revenge on the white harassers. They capture them and put them in a cage. Then they proceed to beat them up, urinate on them and sexually degrade and torture them until they completely break down and submit to the power of their black masters. The Blakes also invite Eric Top Stud, a light- skinned Puerto Rican stud to take part in abusing the neo-Nazis. There are also scenes of incest between Chris and Bobby Blake with Chris being the sole submissive black in the film.

However, he had asked Dick Wadd before he quit to act in one last film with his ex-partner Flex-Deon Blake with no strings attached, where Bobby would be given the upper hand in doing whatever he pleased or fantasized. Most of the plot was reportedly left unscripted and entirely to the discretion of Bobby Blake who wanted to keep the element of surprise and apprehension on the rest of the characters in the film including the three submissive characters and the director. Whilst filming the movie, two of the white actors were reportedly concussed on set as a result of vigorous pounding and filming had to be stopped as the two men were brought round with proper hydration. Bobby Blake explains in his autobiography My Life in Porn: The Bobby Blake Story in the chapter consecrated to Niggas' Revenge: But Bobby Blake praised the three submissive white actors of the film for accepting to go on with no strings attached. In My Life in Porn he admits: Bobby Blake also apologized for the unprotected sex of the film.  Reception = Critical response = Robert Franklin of GayVN gave the film a three out of a possible five, and wrote that it \\"really pushes the envelope\\" and \\"is definitely not for the faint-hearted\\". = Academic analysis = The film Niggas' Revenge has become the subject of serious academic discussion about race relations through sex and reversal of roles of oppressor and oppressed. In his book, Unlimited Intimacy: Reflections on the Subculture of Barebacking, Tim Dean, a professor at the University at Buffalo, treats Niggas' Revenge in detail that all in order, Dean argues, to \\"conjure the transgressive charge of unprotected anal sex among gay men\\", the film \\"fetishizes the simultaneous transgression of a number of taboos\\".Tim Dean, Unlimited Intimacy: Reflections on the Subculture of Barebacking (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2009), 157.Tim Dean, Unlimited Intimacy: Reflections on the Subculture of Barebacking - \\"Viral fetishism, Visual fetishism\\" chapter Dean analyzes the portrayal of racism in the movie: On the troubling unprotected sex in the midst of the HIV epidemic, Dean says: On fetishizing the black body represented in many interracial sex scenes, Dean explains: The cultural prohibition on incestuous sex is also broken in the film, argues Dean.  Sequel  In 2009, Dick Wadd filmed and released a sequel entitled Niggas' Revenge 2.

Nicknamed \\"The Babyface Killer\\", Kaya is responsible for ten murders.  Killings  Ali Kaya committed crime such as theft, assault and snatch theft, and was imprisoned at the age of 17. He was released from prison in 1997 when he was 19 years old. The same year, he began his murders. He stabbed his uncle Celal Kaya to death while working at his real estate office in Alanya in 1997. Kaya was sentenced to five-year aggravated imprisonment in Silifke Prison for this crime. In 1999, he was released on parole. He then killed Zeynel Abidin Gümüş, who he believed had sexually assaulted his mother. During his incarceration at Elazığ Prison, he was diagnosed with a \\"mental disorder\\". Kaya was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, from where he was released due to a report attesting him as having claustrophobia. With his freedom, he stabbed three people in Alanya, a music hall owner called \\"Dedo\\", a procurer called \\"Mehmet of Ağrı\\" and Fırat S., of whom two died later. Since he had a psychiatric report, he was not detained during his trial. Kaya killed two wardens of Alanya prison, Kemal Aksakal and Hasan Askeroğlu, by stabbing them in the street. He was placed in Manisa Psychiatric Hospital with the diagnosis of a personality disorder. In the night of 13 March 2000, he murdered his roommate, the rapist and child killer Ayhan Kartal, nicknamed \\"The Beast of Izmir\\" (), he and Tayfun Şahin stabbed Kartal in the throat and the stomach. Following this crime, Kaya was nicknamed \\"The Babyface Killer\\" (). In 2001, he was arrested and placed in Şanlıurfa Prison. Briefly after his release, he killed Mehmet Poyraz, who lived in his parental home in Gaziantep. Kaya was again captured in November 2013 by the Turkish Gendarmerie forces after a fierce shootout.  2003 escape  Ali Kaya escaped from the semi-open prison in Şanlıurfa in 2003. He was apprehended in 2004 when a suspicious vehicle was stopped in the village of Mahmutlar, Alanya. He possessed a fake ID card under the name Erdal Yılmaz. A long \\"death list\\" was found on him, which included the names of notable businessmen and people he claims abused him during his childhood. Kaya stated in his interrogation that \\"he would confront his enemies and the sinners. He was not successful so far. However, he would cleanse the society of bad people\\".  2014 escape  On 5 January 2014, Ali Kaya managed to escape for a second time. During visitation hours at 10:30 local time on Sunday, he apparently walked out of Gaziantep Prison with the crowd of visitors. His absence was noticed only during the physical check of inmates in the evening. Kaya is considered by the authorities to be extremely dangerous, and both police and gendarmerie forces launched an extensive manhunt for his capture. It was discovered that he went to Adana and Mersin, and had plans to cross the Syrian border. He was captured by security forces in downtown Gaziantep on 3 March 2014 as he fled from the house of a friend of his. He was found in possession of a handgun and a death list of ten persons when he was apprehended. Kaya was returned to the prison he had escaped from.

Local anesthetic nerve block (local anesthetic regional nerve blockade, or often simply nerve block) is a short- term nerve block involving the injection of local anesthetic as close to the nerve as possible for pain relief. The local anesthetic bathes the nerve and numbs the area of the body that is supplied by that nerve. The goal of the nerve block is to prevent pain by blocking the transmission of pain signals from the surgical site. The block provides pain relief during and after the surgery. The advantages of nerve blocks over general anesthesia include faster recovery, monitored anesthesia care vs. intubation with an airway tube, and much less postoperative pain. Mechanism of action Local anesthetics act on the voltage-gated sodium channels that conduct electrical impulses and mediate fast depolarization along nerves. Local anesthetics also act on potassium channels, but they block sodium channels more. Lidocaine preferentially binds to the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, but has also been found to bind potassium channels, G protein-coupled receptors, NMDA receptors, and calcium channels in vitro. The duration of the block is mostly influenced by the amount of time the anesthetic is near the nerve. Lipid solubility, blood flow in the tissue, and presence of vasoconstrictors with the anesthetic all play a role in this. A higher lipid solubility makes the anesthetic more potent and have a longer duration of action; however, it also increases the toxicity of the drug. Complications The most common complications of nerve blocks include bleeding, infection, and block failure. Local anesthetic toxicity, the most dangerous complication, is often first detected by symptoms of numbness and tingling around the mouth, metallic taste, or ringing in the ears. Additionally, it may lead to seizures, arrhythmias, and may progress to cardiac arrest. This reaction may stem from an allergy, excessive dose, or intravascular injection. Other complications include nerve injury which has an extremely low rate of 0.029-0.2%. Some research even suggests that ultrasound lowers the risk to 0.0037%. The use of ultrasound and nerve stimulation has greatly improved practitioners’ ability to safely administer nerve blocks. Nerve injury most often occurs from ischaemia, compression, direct neurotoxicity, needle laceration, and inflammation. Aminoesters and aminoamides. There is an aromatic lipophilic portion connected to an intermediate chain and amine hydrophilic portion. Common local anesthetics and adjuvants Local anesthetics are broken down into two categories: ester- linked and amide-linked. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short- acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing the duration of the analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia. Duration of nerve block The duration of the nerve block depends on the type of local anesthetics used and the amount injected around the target nerve. There are short acting (45–90 minutes), intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and long acting anesthetics (4–18 hours). Block duration can be prolonged with use of a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine, which decreases the diffusion of the anesthetic away from the nerve. There are various types of nerve blocks currently performed. Therapeutic blocks may be used for acute pain patients, diagnostic blocks are used to find pain sources, prognostic blocks are used to determine subsequent pain management options, preemptive blocks minimize postoperative pain, and some blocks can be used in place of surgery. Certain surgeries may benefit from placing a catheter that stays in place for 2–3 days postoperatively. Catheters are indicated for some surgeries where the expected postoperative pain lasts longer than 15–20 hours. Pain medication can be injected through the catheter to prevent a spike in pain when the initial block wears off. Nerve blocks may also reduce the risk of developing persistent postoperative pain several months after surgery. Local anesthetic nerve blocks are sterile procedures that can be performed with the help of anatomical landmarks, ultrasound, fluoroscopy (a live X-ray), or CT. Use of any one of these imaging modalities enables the physician to view the placement of the needle. Electrical stimulation can also provide feedback on the proximity of the needle to the target nerve. Interscalene brachial plexus. Upper extremity nerve blocks The brachial plexus is a bundle of nerves innervating the shoulder and arm and can be blocked at different levels depending on the type of upper extremity surgery being performed. Interscalene brachial plexus blocks can be done before shoulder, arm, and elbow surgery. The interscalene block is done at the neck where the brachial plexus emerges between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Lidocaine is injected first to numb the skin and then a blunt needle is used to protect the nerves from damage as the physician places the needle very close to the nerves. The needle goes in about 3–4 cm and a single shot of local anesthetic is injected or a catheter is placed. The most common local anesthetics used at the site of the nerves are bupivicaine, mepivicaine, and chloroprocaine. There is a very high chance that the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, will be blocked so this block should only be done on patients who have use of their accessory respiratory muscles. The block may not affect the C8 and T1 roots which supply part of the hand, so it is usually not done for hand surgeries. The supraclavicular and infraclavicular blocks can be performed for surgeries on the humerus, elbow, and hand. These blocks are indicated for the same surgeries but they provide different views of the nerves, so it depends on the individual patient's anatomy to determine which block should be performed. A pneumothorax is a risk with these blocks, so the pleura should be checked with ultrasound to make sure the lung was not punctured during the block. The axillary block is indicated for elbow, forearm, and hand surgery. It anesthetizes the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. This block is useful because it has less risk than the interscalene (spinal cord or vertebral artery puncture) or supraclavicular (pneumothorax) brachial plexus blocks. Lumbar plexus innervates the lower extremity. Lower extremity nerve blocks Fascia iliaca block is indicated for pain relief for hip fractures in adults and femoral fractures in children. It works by affecting the femoral, obturator and the lateral cutaneous nerves. 3-in-1 nerve block is indicated for pain relief for hip fractures. The femoral nerve block is indicated for femur, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. It is performed slightly inferior to the inguinal ligament, and the nerve is under the fascia iliaca. The sciatic nerve block is done for surgeries at or below the knee. The nerve is located in the gluteus maximus muscle. The popliteal block is done for ankle, achilles tendon, and foot surgery. It is done above the knee on the posterior leg where the sciatic nerve starts splitting into the common peroneal and tibial nerves. The saphenous nerve block is often done in combination with the popliteal block for surgeries below the knee. The saphenous nerve is numbed at the medial part of the lower thigh under the sartorius muscle. The lumbar plexus block is an advanced technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus is composed of nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and obturator nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is an increased risk of local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but it is often difficult to see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it. Paravertebral nerve block The paravertebral block is versatile and can be used for various surgeries depending on the vertebral level it is done. A block at the neck in the cervical region is useful for thyroid gland and carotid artery surgery. At the chest and abdomen in the thoracic region, blocks are used for breast, thoracic, and abdominal surgery. A block at the hip in the lumbar region is indicated for hip, knee, and anterior thigh surgeries. The paravertebral block provides unilateral analgesia, but bilateral blocks can be performed for abdominal surgeries. Since it is a unilateral block, it may be chosen over epidurals for patients who can't tolerate the hypotension that follows bilateral sympathectomy. The paravertebral space is located a couple centimeters lateral to the spinous process and is bounded posteriorly by the superior costotransverse ligament and anteriorly by the parietal pleura. Complications include pneumothorax, vascular puncture, hypotension, and pleural puncture.

L. Vijay. The film features Nassar in the lead role and child actress Sara Arjun plays another pivotal role, while the director's regular crew of cinematographer Nirav Shah and composer G. V. Prakash Kumar also worked on the project. The film was released on 6 June 2014. The film was remade in Telugu as Dagudumootha Dandakor. Plot Kathiresan is the head of a large family which consists of three sons and a daughter and their respective families. The families get together at the house for vacation. When the entire family goes to their temple on a given day, certain ill-fated events occur. The family believes that it is because it had forgotten to perform a ritual sacrifice which involves the slaughter of a rooster. This thought is fueled all the more by each family member blaming this to be the cause for all their problems both at home and at work. Kathiresan decides to sacrifice Paappa, their pet rooster, in the upcoming festival, and the family is assured that all their problems will disappear eventually after the ritual. Then, suddenly, Paappa goes missing. The members of the family are shocked at Paappa's disappearance and begin searching for it. It is revealed out that Kathiresan's granddaughter Tamizhselvi hid Paappa in the attic in order to save it from getting slaughtered, as she loves Paappa so much that she cannot stand to see it die. The rest of the story revolves around Tamizhselvi's attempts to save Paappa from being slaughtered and the family's attempts to find the rooster and performing the ritual.

Reports initially suggested that Vikram would also play a character but his unavailability meant that the director had chosen to approach Arya instead. Arya however denied reports, stating that Vijay had yet to approach him and only then would he consider portraying a role. Vijay announced his new production studio, Think Big Studios, would make the film and stated that the film would be about a child's love for her rooster. Most of the team's technical crew including the composer G. V Prakash and the cinematographer, Nirav Shah, worked without taking any remuneration for the film as an ode to their friendship with Vijay. The first look poster of the film, featuring a rooster, was released on 16 November 2013 indicating that the film's production was underway. The team, featuring mostly a new cast, completed most of the schedule in a thirty-day stint in Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu. Vijay released more information regarding the cast in January 2014 and announced that the son of actor Nassar, Luthfudeen, would make his acting debut in the film and would have the stage name of Senthil. He would appear alongside another debutant, Twara Desai, while Nassar would play Senthil's grandfather in the film. Filming was completed within forty days and a series of promotional stills featuring the lead cast were released before a press release in March 2014. Talking further about the movie, Vijay revealed that Saivam would be about family values and hoped it would instill lost family traditions into the audiences, noting that he was inspired by his visits back to his home village. Soundtrack The film's audio soundtrack and trailer were released on 5 April 2014 at a launch event in Chennai. An ambience of a village was created outside the venue, while all male guests were asked to wear a dhoti to the event. The album was released by Gautham Menon, Anushka Shetty and Amala Paul, while each song from the film was introduced to the audience by different film personalities including Jayam Ravi, Vijay Sethupathi and Siddharth. Singer P. Unnikrishnan's eight-year-old daughter Uthara Unnikrishnan recorded the song \\"Azhagu\\". The film also features a song with performances from Chinna Ponnu and Gaana Bala, a melody sung by Haricharan and two instrumental tracks composed by G. V. Prakash.

It is located where Istedgade reaches Enghavevej, which separates the square from Enghave Park. History Enghave Plads Enghave Plads was established when the Vesterbro area was built over in the late 1880s. A playground was established on the site in the late 1880s at the initiative of architect and city council member Ferdinand Meldahl. Enghave Plads School opened on the square in 1892. Christ Church, completed in 1900, was the second church to be built in the rapidly growing Vesterbro neighbourhood. Boy with fiasco, a fountain designed by Jens Lund, was installed in the centre of the square in 1903. For many years the square played host to an annual fun fair. Peter Hansen: Playing children. Enghave Plads (1907) From its opening in 1902 Enghave Plads was the southern terminus of Line 3 of the Copenhagen Tramways, which operated between Melchiors Plads in Østerbro and the square by way of Nørrebro and Frederiksberg. The tram line was extended to Frederiksholm in 1915 and again from Frederiksholm to Mozarts Plads in 1937. The square seen from the east, c. 1950. A narrow slice of Enghave Park can be seen at the top The area on the other side of Enghavevej remained open land. The Royal Danish Horticultural Society established 478 allotments at the site. They were moved and the small public Enghave Park was laid out under the direction of City Architect Poul Holsøe, who also designed the red-brick social housing which was built at the same time and borders the park on three sides. The square was renovated and pedestrianized in 1995. The 114-year-old chestnut tree, which for decades had dominated the square, was removed in October 2011 to make way for the operating of Enghave Plads Station, a station on the City Circle Line. Notable buildings and residents The day care on the corner of Enghave Plads and Enghavevej After a merger with Mathæusgade School in 2008, Enghave Plads School is now part of Tove Ditlevsen's School. Both buildings were designed by city architect Ludvig Fenger. Christ Church was designed by Valdemar Koch in an Italian style. He also designed the two residential buildings that flank it on both sides. The buildings on the north (Istedgade) side of the square are from 1898 and were designed by Christian Mandrup- Poulsen. Jens Christian Kofoed also contributed to the buildings around the square. A cluster of low buildings that were formerly used by the tram workers have been converted into a kindergarten.

It pays homage to 1980s martial arts and police action films. The film stars Sandberg in the title role, Jorma Taccone, Leopold Nilsson, and a cameo appearance by David Hasselhoff. The film was crowdfunded through Kickstarter from December 2013 to January 2014 with pledges reaching US$630,019, exceeding the original target goal of $200,000, but short of the feature film goal of $1 million. It was selected to screen in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, losing to Rate Me from the United Kingdom. Plot Sometime in the early 1980s, Miami- Dade Police Department detective Kung Fury and his partner Dragon apprehend a red ninja in a back alley, but Dragon is sliced in half by the ninja while Kung Fury is suddenly struck by lightning and bitten by a cobra, giving him extraordinary kung fu powers that enable him to defeat his foe. Years later in 1985, after defeating a rogue arcade machine robot, Kung Fury quits the force when he is assigned to partner with Triceracop, fearing that he would lose another partner in the line of duty. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler, a.k.a. \\"Kung Führer\\", enters the timeline and remotely guns down the police chief and attacks the precinct through a mobile phone. Intent to avenge the chief, Kung Fury has computer whiz Hackerman send him back in time to kill Hitler in Nazi Germany. A glitch in the system, however, sends him back into the Viking Age. After Kung Fury meets the Viking valkyries Barbarianna and Katana, the Norse god Thor sends him to Nazi Germany for him to finish his job. Upon his arrival, Kung Fury singlehandedly mows down dozens of Nazi soldiers with his kung fu skills, but is gunned down by Hitler using a Gatling-type gun from inside his podium. Suddenly, Thor, Hackerman, Triceracop, the Viking valkyries, and a tyrannosaurus hack into the timeline and kill the rest of the Nazi army while the tyrannosaurus squares off against Hitler's robotic Reichsadler. After being revived by Hackerman, Kung Fury gives Hitler an uppercut to the testicle before Thor drops his hammer on the Nazi leader and his robotic eagle. Seeing his mission as accomplished, Kung Fury returns to his timeline. Back in 1985 Miami, Kung Fury once again battles and defeats the arcade machine robot, but notices a Swastika on the robot's body while Hitler and his Reichsadler enter the timeline, vowing revenge on Kung Fury.

David Sandberg is a Swedish filmmaker who had previously directed television commercials and music videos. In 2012, he quit the commercial directing business and focused on writing a script for an action comedy film set in the 1980s, inspired by action films of that era. He initially spent US$5,000 on producing and shooting footage with his friends, which became the trailer. In December 2013, Sandberg released the trailer and began a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the film's production with the goal of raising US$200,000 to produce a 30-minute version of the film and stream it online for free. A second goal was added with the target set to $1 million to rewrite the story into a full-length feature and a possible distribution deal. Most of the raw footage over green screen had been filmed using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III and a Sony FS700, but additional funding was required for post- production. The Kickstarter project ended on 25 January 2014, with $630,019 pledged by 17,713 backers. =Filming= Due to a limited budget, Sandberg shot the majority of the film at his office in Umeå, Sweden, using digital effects to replicate the streets of Miami. As he could only afford one police uniform during the production of the trailer, he filmed the police precinct scene by shooting each extra separately and compositing them in the scene. The single-shot scene where Kung Fury dispatches dozens of Nazi soldiers was achieved by combining the primary take of Sandberg's moves with over 60 takes of individual extras attacking him. On 30 July 2014, Sandberg announced that he and his crew had begun filming new footage, with the 30 backers who pledged to be in the film as extras. Filming was also done in Stockholm for additional scenes and stunts. For the scene with Barbarianna riding a giant wolf, Sandberg used stock footage of a black wolf from the website GreenScreen Animals, as sourcing a real wolf was impossible in Sweden. Miniatures were used in Kung Fury's fight scenes involving the arcade machine robot and the Red Ninja. The animated \\"Heaven\\" sequence was produced by French video game developer Old Skull Games. In keeping with the film's '80s theme, the visual effects artists softened the film clarity and added videotape wear effects to give the illusion of it being a worn VHS copy being played on an old VCR. One instance of this effect is in the scene where the Viking Babe Katana summons Thor. The scene was in the trailer with Joanna Häggblom originally as Katana, but because Häggblom was replaced by Helene Ahlson for the actual film, visual scratches and distortion effects were added to the scene to mask the cast change. =Soundtrack= The soundtrack score was composed by Swedish synthwave musicians Mitch Murder and Lost Years, with additional music by Patrik Öberg, Christoffer Ling, Highway Superstar, and Betamaxx. The official soundtrack album was released on vinyl record on 8 July 2015. Release The film made its debut at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and premiered on YouTube, the Steam PC gaming platform, SVT2 in Sweden, and the El Rey Network in the United States, on 28 May 2015. By 1 June, the film had received over 10 million views on YouTube. , the video has scored over 33 million views on YouTube. The film has also been made available on VoD platforms through a distribution deal with Under the Milky Way. Critical reception Kung Fury was met with positive reviews from critics. Tyler Richardson of Latino-Review gave the film an A, commenting that \\"What Black Dynamite got so perfect about Blaxploitation films, this does wonderfully for 80s cop movies.\\" Jonny Bunning of Bloody Disgusting gave the film a score of three-and-a-half out of five skulls, saying that \\"Kung Fury is the Avengers Assemble if it had been made in the 90s.\\" Todd Brown of Twitch Film also praised the film, calling it \\"a thirty-minute long, nonstop assault of some of the most astounding visual gags ever assembled in one place. Kung Fury knows its audience, knows it damn well, and while it has little to offer to anyone outside of its particular niche, for people within that niche this is absolute gold.\\" Scott Weinberg of Nerdist Industries called it \\"a 31-minute masterpiece that feels like it fell right out of 1985 and hit just about every awesome b-movie genre on the way down.\\" Melissa Locker of Vanity Fair praised the film, jokingly calling it \\"the best movie ever, of course.\\" Awards and nominations Kung Fury received the following awards and nominations:Kung Fury (2015) Awards , Internet Movie Database *Mexico City International Contemporary Film Festival — Best Film — Won *Guldbagge Awards — Best Short Film — Won *Cannes Film Festival — Directors' Fortnight (Short Film) — Nominated *Empire Awards — Best Short Film — Nominated *European Film Awards — European Short Film — Nominated Video game Kung Fury: Street Rage is the companion video game to the film published by Hello There AB released in June 2015, paying homage to classic beat 'em up games such as Streets of Rage, Double Dragon, and Final Fight. The gameplay also resembles One Finger Death Punch by Silver Dollar Games, with the player pressing left or right of the character to attack in either direction. It is available on PlayStation Vita (PSN), Android (Google Play), iOS (App Store) and Windows (Steam). An upgraded version of the game, titled Kung Fury: Street Rage - The Arcade Strikes Back, was released on PlayStation 4 and Windows in December 2015. The game features additional boss fights and enables players to fight as Kung Fury's allies Triceracop, Barbarianna, and Hackerman. Sequel On 28 May 2016, it was announced on the Laser Unicorns Facebook page that Kung Fury II The Movie is in development. Sandberg is currently working with producers Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg on a full-length feature film version of Kung Fury. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he stated that the project would be a \\"clean slate\\", containing no footage from the short film but taking place in the same universe. In February 2018, Michael Fassbender and Arnold Schwarzenegger were confirmed to star alongside Hasselhoff in the upcoming film. On 16 May 2019, it was announced that Creasun Entertainment USA purchased a majority stake in the film's rights and will co-produce it with Argent Pictures. Filming is set to commence on 29 July 2019 in Bulgaria and Germany. On 13 September 2019, Schwarzenegger confirmed the film's title as Kung Fury 2, that he would portray the President of the United States, and that filming was to begin that day. On 25 September, the official Laser Unicorns Instagram page confirmed that Kung Fury 2 had wrapped filming.

It stands on a small plateau just under the peak of Kredarica, an elevation in the ridge between Mt. Rjavina and Mt. Triglav. The Valentin Stanič Lodge (Dom Valentina Staniča) stands to the northeast below Begunje Peak (Begunjski vrh, 2,460 m), and the Planika Lodge at Triglav (Dom Planika pod Triglavom) stands to the south. In the vicinity there is also a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Snows, and a few metres away there is a small cave named Ivačič Cave.  History  Opening of the lodge in 1896 The first hut, named the Triglav Hut (), was built in 1896 at the initiative of Jakob Aljaž. Later it was expanded three times, and it is now one of the largest mountain lodges in Slovenia. It can accommodate 200 hikers or more. In 1909, the Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club expanded the hut and renamed it the Triglav Lodge (). In 1954 it was expanded again due to the increased number of visits after World War II. It was expanded for the last time in 1983. Operation The lodge is open to visitors all year round. Most visitors come from the end of June to the end of September. Outside the main season the residential meteorologists handle the visitors. The hut is managed by Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club. There is no cable car, and the hut is supplied by helicopters of the Slovenian Armed Forces. The Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club's goal is to reduce the environmental impact of the hut. In 1992 they built a photovoltaic power station and in 1998 a small wind generator. In 1992 they set up a base station and repaired the telephone line.

Retrieved 6 Jan 2014. According to recent research, the forked cross emerged under the influence of the mystics in the late 13th or early 14th century and is especially common in the German Rhineland, where it is also called a Gabelkreuz (\\"fork cross\\"), Mystikerkruzifix (\\"mystic's cross\\"), Gabelkruzifix (\\"fork crucifix\\"), Schächerkreuz (\\"robber's cross\\"), or Pestkreuz (\\"plague cross\\").  Description  It is believed that the forked cross represents a tree, or more precisely, the Tree of Knowledge, which brought sin into the world. However sin was defeated by the suffering of Jesus on the cross at Calvary. Typical of the mystic crucifixes is the body of Christ hanging on a Y-shaped tree fork with his head falling low over his chest, his mouth contorted with pain and his eyes full of tears. His narrow, sinewy arms stretch more upward than sideways, his thin body is strongly bent and deeply sunken below the breastbone, with prominently protruding ribs and a gaping wound in his side. Fingers and toes are spread apart and spasmodically bent. The overall impression of the painted figure was intended to be so horrific that believers would be in fear and terror. It is recorded that in 1306 the Bishop of London removed a mystic crucifix for this reason.  Emergence  Coesfeld Cross Religious currents of the 13-14th century developed, under the influence of mysticism, a piety centred on Christ's Passion, which expressed itself in this image form that portrayed Jesus' suffering in a particularly graphic way. In art history, the technical term crucifixus dolorosus has come to be used, a term introduced by Geza de Francovich. Gothic passion crucifixes often use forked crosses, but not in all cases. Quite a few hang on Latin crosses. But they are almost always in the form of branches that recall the Tree of Life. The aforementioned term \\"plague cross\\" (Pestkreuz) is misleading, since crucifixi dolorosi appeared soon after 1300, i.e. before the outbreak of the great plague in Western Europe. Little is known about their original function. What is certain is that the Coesfeld Cross had already been carried through the town during processions from the beginning. Many forked crosses are found in places run by the Dominican and Franciscan orders, especially in Italy. Not until the Counter-Reformation did people begin to honour the crosses in many places with a special procession. Often the two thieves will appear on a forked cross, while Jesus is depicted hanging on a straight beam. Hence the alternative name of \\"robber's cross\\" or \\"thief's cross\\" (Schächerkreuz).  Distribution  The forked cross in the church of St. Mary's in the Capitol in Cologne was thought for a long time to be the oldest forked crucifix. Restoration work revealed, however, that it was not the original prototype for all forked crosses, but that this crucifix may have been the catalyst for the popularization of this type of cross in the Rhineland. The cross at St. Mary's in the Capitol was carved in the 14th century (before 1312). Restoration work in recent years revealed much of the late medieval, second painting (Zweitfassung). Small sections of the exposed, first painting revealed astonishing similarities with the original coat of paint of the Bocholt Cross, once again visible since 1967, which used the Cologne Cross as a prototype, even though different sculptors were employed. The crucifixus dolorosus from St. Mary's in the Capitol bears very little similarity with the style of the Rhenish and Cologne sculptors of its time; it appears to be a singular work of outstanding quality. It is therefore questionable whether this forked cross was created by a Cologne wood carver. Even the other sculptures of this type in Germany appear to be by \\"foreign\\" craftsmen when compared with the local art of their particular region. They only had a limited, local following. On the other hand, artistic links to crosses in other countries can be recognised. Especially clear is an Italian influence. Thus it is possible that the original forked crosses were imported order that they were carved by itinerant craftsmen, which is why, in the case of the crucifix in St. Mary's in the Capitol local walnut wood may have been used. Another early example of these mystic crucifixes, besides the one in St. Mary's in the Capitol, is that in St. Severin's Church in Cologne. Other, later crosses exist in Haltern, Bocholt, Borken and in St. Lambert's, Coesfeld. The crucifixes in St. Simon and St. Jude's in Thorr (Bergheim county), St. John's in Lage/Rieste (Lower Saxony), the cross in St. Peter's Church, Merzig and the crucifix in the Roman Catholic parish church of St. John the Baptist in Kendenich (Hürth) also belong to this group. Haltern118763.jpgThe Haltern Cross 20150328_Bocholter_Kreuz_(09022).jpgThe Bocholt Cross. These sorts of crucifix are also found, albeit in much smaller numbers, in other European countries, not just in Italy, but also in Switzerland and in Upper Austria and in Spain.  Heraldry  The \\"pall\\" In heraldry the forked cross is used as a charge whose arms extend, in the shape of a fork, towards the upper edge of the shield. If the cross touches the edges of the shield it is called a pall. Otherwise it is known as a shakefork.  References  Literature  * Monika von Alemann-Schwartz: Crucifixus dolorosus.

It lies between 10th and 11th Avenues. The park, officially called Bella Abzug Park, is located in the median of the boulevard, which consists of two one-way roads that run parallel to each other. When complete, it will be in area, six blocks long, and run north-south between 33rd and 39th Streets. The boulevard will be in the center of the park when complete. Construction will be in two phases; the first phase, located between 33rd and 36th Streets, was under construction from 2012 to August 2015. The second phaseTHE WESTERN YARD, hudsonyardsnewyork.com has no timeline. The total cost of the project is more than $30 million.  History  MTA depiction of the 33rd and 34th Streets block of the park and boulevard, with subway entrance and buildings included In the 1930s, there was a proposal to build a street in the middle of the block between 10th and 11th Avenues, running from 34th to 42nd Streets within roughly the same place as the current Hudson Boulevard. It would have fed into the Lincoln Tunnel. One block of the street was actually built between 40th and 41st Streets. The road was named Galvin Avenue, after Port Authority of New York and New Jersey chair John F. Galvin, and was labeled as such through the 1980s. This name was still in use as recently as 2017, although there are no street signs for it. In January 2005, the New York City Council approved the rezoning of about 60 blocks from 28th to 43rd Streets, creating the neighborhood of Hudson Yards; the need for a park in the area was seen when Hudson Yards was being planned. The park and boulevard was developed concurrently with the New York City Subway's 7 Subway Extension to 34th Street. The park contains the two entrances to the 34th Street station. The first entrance is located between 33rd and 34th streets, and a second entrance is between 34th and 35th streets. Phase one of the park's layout, led by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, was finished in January 2012. Construction began in January 2012. Since the boulevard was brand-new, it would conform to New York City Department of Transportation standards set in 2012. A traffic signal was installed at 34th Street to facilitate pedestrian flow through the park.Streetscape Manual A business improvement district for the park, started in early 2014, is being led by Robert J. Benfatto Jr., of Manhattan Community Board 4. The BID has a $1.2 million budget in its first year, which will go up to $3 million in subsequent years. Its budget is used for Hudson Park maintenance and operations, district-wide services and improvements, administration and advocacy. , the section of the park between 33rd and 34th Streets was completed, and was to open at the end of 2014. However, the section between 34th and 36th Streets was delayed to August 2015, while the 33rd to 34th Streets section did not open until the 34th Street station opened on September 13, 2015. On March 1, 2019, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation announced that Hudson Park was to be renamed in honor of Bella Abzug, a New York representative and one of the leading endorsers of the second-wave feminism movement. This was part of an effort by Bill de Blasio's association's plan to recognize female New Yorkers during Women's History Month. Description Phase 1 of the park, which was opened in July 2015 Fountains in the park The boulevard is split into two, with a Hudson Boulevard East and a Hudson Boulevard West. The park serves as a median. The boulevard starts from a restricted driveway (extending from 31st Street westbound) at 33rd Street and is one-way northbound to 35th Street, with the park to the west of the roadway. North of 35th Street, a southbound roadway forms and the park is located between the two roadways up to 36th Street. Future plans call for the park to be extended up to 39th Street (although the western roadway ends at 38th Street, the eastern roadway and the park go up to 39th Street). Then, a High Line-style promenade above the Lincoln Tunnel entrance will be constructed in the second phase to connect the greenway to 42nd Street. The boulevard's southern end is integrated with the Hudson Yards Public Square, an L-shaped public square that is intended to be Hudson Yards' centerpiece. The first phase of the park and boulevard has lawns, a fountain, a café, wooden benches, planting beds, and a playground. Three fountains between 34th and 35th Street are able to detect wind speeds and shut off during high winds. A 50-foot-high pole designed by James Carpenter between 35th and 36th Streets was built as a café location. Additionally, the Amtrak Empire Connection will run underneath the park. The park will be owned by the city. It, along with the High Line, Hudson Yards public square, and Hudson River Park, will create a pedestrian-friendly greenway. The first phase and part of the second phase of Hudson Boulevard West is already completed. The boulevard is bordered on the west and east between 33rd and 34th Streets by the future locations of 55 Hudson Yards and 50 Hudson Yards, respectively. Currently, the 55 Hudson Yards space is occupied by a subway ventilation building, with a facade containing a U.S. flag pattern on the side of the building facing the park and boulevard. On April 30, 2014, Tishman Speyer announced the acquisition of land between the Hudson Park & Boulevard and Tenth Avenue, between 34th and 35th Streets; which will be razed to make way for a \\"Hudson Spire\\", to be the tallest building in America with a potential height of over and 108 stories. Although the boulevard is six blocks long, the park extends as a non-vehicular greenway north to 42nd Street via a pedestrian bridge, and through the Hudson Yards development south to 30th Street and connecting with the High Line. One side of the park is to be commercial and the other side residential.

He was born in Herveo, Tolima. He won the Romulo Gallegos Prize for his novel El país de la canela, part of a trilogy about the invasion and conquest of South America.  Life  William Ospina was born in Herveo, Tolima on 2 March 1954, but his family had to move around the south of the Colombia quite often due to the violence of the time. His father, Luis Ospina, a nurse and musician nurtured in his son a strong passion for Colombian culture \\"We had no books and home, but we had all the songs\\". He grew up in Cali where he studied law and political sciences at Santiago de Cali University. He quit his job and decided to devote to literature. He lived in Paris from 1979 to 1981. When he returned to Colombia, he became editor for the Sunday news of La Prensa Newspaper in Bogotá (1988-1989). He has written essays about Lord Byron, Edgar Allan Poe, León Tolstói, Charles Dickens, Emily Dickinson, One Thousand and One Nights, Alfonso Reyes, Estanislao Zuleta, and William Shakespeare.  Literary themes = Invasion and colonization of Latin America = Ospina has written several essays and articles regarding this period, establishing how valuable the understanding of these events is for the comprehension of Latin-Americans’ identity, as well as its social, cultural, and political challenges. In 2005, Ospina starts a trilogy of semi-historical novels about this time period: The first book, Ursúa, depicts the life of the young conquistador Pedro de Ursúa who was initially loyal to law and justice of the Spanish crown, but as he explores the new world, he gets taken by greed and turns into a ferocious warrior who kills for power and gold. Most of the historical events narrated in these novels are inspired by the XVI century poems of Juan de Castellanos. The second book, El país de la canela, tells the first trip of Francisco de Orellana through the Amazon River and the conquests of Francisco Pizarro. This novel was awarded the Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 2009. The third book, La serpiente sin ojos, narrates the attempt of Ursúa to repeat Orellana’s trip to discover the country of the Amazons. The book also recounts the crimes of Lope de Aguirre. = Romanticism = In 2015, Ospina publishes his novel El Verano que nunca llegó, where he depicts his literary investigation about the story of Villa Doidati and the events that in 1816 gave birth to the two famous literary works of Frankenstein and The Vampyre. The story travels back and forth in time, describing Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron and Mary Shelly´s life events and Ospina´s visit to sites connected these characters. This book differs from his previous works, focused on Latin American history, to the description of global historical events with emphasis on European romanticism and its influence to our days. Ospina ponders about how past and present intertwine. How places seem to be meant to be in some people´s lives.  Views  He has openly criticized the ineffectiveness of the Colombian government to protect its people and care for its necessities. He also recriminates the Colombian population for its apathy and lack of strong demands to its government. He has supported the Colombian peace process and on April 9, 2013, during a national march of over a million people, the Colombian congresswoman Piedad Córdoba read a prayer named Oración por la paz written by Ospina. He proposes education as a solution for many of the society problems, understanding education not only as school related, but as the example that society and media gives to children. He states that youth must feel empowered enough to take part in their present and be able to change the future of a nation. According to a Colombian Newspaper, Ospina has dedicated his life to the art of thinking. His work always invites people to question their history, politics, social interactions and the handling of natural resources.  Cultural contribution  He has been praised by icons of Latin American literature. In 1996, Mario Vargas Llosa wrote a 2-page article in the newspaper El Pais where he analyzes the collection of essays Es tarde para el hombre, he judges Ospina's work as bewitching and of high quality, although Vargas Llosa does not agree with his ideas, he describes the author as a skilled manufacturer of sociological fictions that transfers to a mythical past. In 2005, Gabriel García Márquez defined Ospina’s first novel as \\"the best book of the year\\", and Fernando Vallejo stated that the prose used in Ursúa has no competitor in the Spanish language. His work has been used by universities and academic groups to analyze political history of Colombia and other countries. In 2018, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo posted an article about the divisions within the country because of Catalonia, the article proposes Ospina’s idea of a united nation in which all differences are accepted, as a solution to the Spanish conflict. Ospina has represented Colombia in literary international evets, including Panama’s book fair in 2017 and Dominican Republic’s book fair in 2019. The magazine Arcadia included his novel, El año del verano que nunca llegó, in the recommended books to read in the Bogota’s Book Fair of 2015.

Drawing of Terkel Klevenfeldt ( 1710 – 1777 ), National Archives of Denmark, Copenhagen, Klevenfeldt Private Collection, Packet 50. Photo: Arne Kvitrud in 2007 Hoskuld Hoskuldsson (1465/1470 – c.1537 ) was the 28th and last Roman Catholic Bishop of Stavanger, from 1513 until the Reformation in 1537, and also a member of the Riksråd.  Background  Hoskuld is thought to have been from the local gentry of Ryfylke in Norway, because his known writings showed words and phrases from the dialect of Ryfylke. He was enrolled in 1491 at the University of Rostock in Germany and graduated two years later with a Magister's degree. He held services at the cathedral chapter in Stavanger, where he was described as an archdeacon. He was elected as the Bishop of Stavanger in 1513 and consecrated in Rome on 19 June in the same year. For the rest of his life, he used a cross as his personal seal, with several variations, for the documents of his diocese and the Riksråd.  The Dispute with the Abbot of the Utstein Monastery  Hoskuld came early into a serious conflict with the abbot of the Utstein Abbey. In 1515 the abbot, Henrik of Utstein, complained to the King of Denmark and Norway, Christian II, about the treatment he and his monastery had been getting from Bishop Hoskuld. Accused of \\"unpredictable realities\\" [ Wskelligt leffnet ] by the Bishop, Henrik had been brought to Stavanger and \\"put in the tower and irons\\" [ i tårn og jern ] in a bloody state. Hoskuld had accused Henrik of being a heretic. He also sent his servants to the Utstein Abbey to arrest a woman there. Hoskuld had her tortured, forcing her to lie about Henrik and herself. He then sent her to Sweden. The King ordered six clerics to judge and settle the dispute but the verdict is not known. What is known is that Hoskuld afterwards sided with the next King of Denmark and Norway, Frederick I, especially after 1521, when Christian II had the Bishop's kinsman, Orm Eriksson, tried and executed on the charges of leading a tax revolt in Rogaland. In the autumn of 1523, together with the Bishop of Bergen, Olav Torkelsson, and the rikshovmester [ Lord High Steward ] of Norway, Nils Henriksson of Austrått ( who died soon afterwards), Hoskuld called for a meeting in Bergen to deliver the support at the Bergenhus to Frederick.  The National Council  Since he became the Bishop of Stavanger, Hoskuld was a member of the Riksråd [ National Council ] and participated in meetings in Oslo and Copenhagen. On 15 June 1524, King Frederick I of Denmark appointed the Archbishop of Nidaros, Olav Engelbrektsson; the Bishop of Stavanger, Hoskuld Hoskuldsson; the Bishop of Bergen, Olav Torkelsson; and Vincens Lunge ( the son-in-law of Nils Henriksson ) to be advisers to the stattholders for Norway north of Lindesnes. On 5 August 1524, at the meeting of the Riksråd of Norway in Bergen, all the councilors, including Hoskuld, swore their allegiance to King Frederick, two days before his coronation in Copenhagen.  The War of the Two Kings  In 1529 Norway and Bishop Hoskuld were plunged into a war-like situation. The former king Christian II was raiding their old kingdom with the aim to make himself the King of Norway again. At this time also began the followers of Martin Luther were beginning to assert themselves. Hoskuld, always concerned about his Church's safety and security, wrote letters of complaints about them. In a rare burst of emotion, he asked the new rikshovmester of Norway, Eske Bille, to keep him away from \\"the damned infidels and Lutherans, many of whom are blinded in their hearts, but punish them wherever it is needed\\" [ den fordömte vantro og lutheri, hvoraf mange i hjærtet ere forblindede, men straffe dem, hvor det behøvedes ]. [ Povl ] Frederik Barfod, Danmarks Historie fra 1536 til 1670, Förste Bind : fra 1536 til 1563 [ The History of Denmark from 1536 to 1670, First Volume : from 1536 to 1563 ] ( Copenhagen : Karl Schönbergs Forlag, 1891 ), page 156. The Bishop was also afraid that Vincens Lunge was going to secularize the Ustein Monastery; that was the reason for their falling out at the meeting in 1531 in Copenhagen. Meanwhile, the soldiers of King Christian II were shipped to the south of Norway, leading Eske Bille to request the help from Hoskuld but the Bishop declined. In 1532, Hoskuld gave the money to King Christian's viceroy but wrote that that was not for the support of the King but in fear of the ships that came with him to Agder in that year. A long series of letters to and from Bishop Hoskuld has been preserved for the first half of 1532, covering the campaigns and battles of King Christian II in his attempt to take control of Norway. Both parties tried to get Bishop Hoskuld to side with them but he did not want to take sides in the strife. In July 1532 Christian II was captured. His supporters, including the Archbishop of Nidaros, were politically weakened as the result. But Bishop Hoskuld still would not make a stand in the controversy and, for the next several years, he ran into problems for his explanations. On 8 May 1536, Hoskuld abstained from the royal election. Everyone in the National Council of Norway but one chose Christian III as the next King of Norway. The exception was Bishop Hoskuld – who had not spoken out – but he was pressured to affix his seal and signature to the proclamation a month later. Hoskuld was a careful and distinctly peaceful man who did not wish to interfere with the political struggles of Denmark. At the same time he had hoped and believed that it would still be possible to preserve both the Catholic faith and the church's properties in his diocese.  The Reformation  Thomas B. Willson, the British historian, wrote in 1903 that, \\"as long as Eske Bille remained in power, the bishop was left alone.\\" He had Bille to deliver his present of a silver bowl to King Christian III. Thomas B[enjamin]. Willson, History of the Church and State in Norway from the Tenth Century to the Sixteenth Century ( Westminster : Archibald Constable & Co., Ltd., 1903 ), pages 347. According to the Danish historian Arild Huitfeldt in 1595, Truid Ulfstand then brought the Bishop of Stavanger to Copenhagen as a prisoner in 1537. In a case from 1607, it was stated that Tord Rodt, the governor of the Bergenhus, had caught Hoskuld, \\"taken all that was under the Bishop and placed them under the King\\" [ tatt alt som lå under biskopen og lagt det under kongen ]. Peder Claussøn Friis wrote in the early 1600s that Hoskuld was captured along with the other bishops in 1536 and died in Bergen in 1547 or 1538. But the contemporary details of the Bishop's actual capture and imprisonment could not be found.  References  Sources  * Unni Kurseth, Hoskuld Hoskuldsson.

The team would win the 2018 Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Duncan's first provincial title, sending her to her first Scotties Tournament of Hearts in 2018. There, her team posted a 4–3 round robin record which qualified them for the tiebreaker against Newfoundland and Labrador's Stacie Curtis. Ontario scored three in the ninth end and stole two in the tenth for a 11–8 win and a spot in the Championship Pool. They would not win any more games, finishing the tournament with a 4–7 record. The following season, she failed to qualify for the playoffs at the 2019 Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts after losing the tiebreaker 10–5 to Julie Tippin. Duncan started the 2019–20 season with a quarterfinal finish at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic despite qualifying for the playoffs as the number one seed.

Location Schloss Lauterbach stands on a moraine hill in the east of the village of Lauterbach, about west of the town of Dachau north of the autobahn between Augsburg and Munich. The main castle complex is surrounded by a moat to the south and west, almost always dry, which is scarcely visible due to the woods that have been allowed to grow. History The Lauterbach estate was established by the first half of the 13th century. The Dachau family made Lauterbach their seat from around 1250 to 1437. The castle then passed through marriage to Veit von Eglofstein. He and his wife sold the castle in 1449, and there were various changes of ownership in the next hundred years. In 1550 Jörg or Georg Hundt zu Lauterbach und Valkenstein took possession and restored the castle. At this time it was a tall rectangular building surrounded by a thick ring wall, with defensive towers in the four corners. The castle was damaged during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). By the end of the war it had been burned down. In the second half of the 17th century Johann Franz Maximilian Servatius von Hundt undertook a major restoration, depicted in engravings by Michael Wening. Castle thumb thumb The oldest depiction of Schloss Lauterbach is in a map by Philipp Apian from 1568. It is a rough drawing, but shows the remains of a fort with four corner towers. An engraving by Michael Wening from around 1700 shows the castle complex with a French parterre to the east of the castle. The earlier main structure is shown, with the addition of a chapel and a wing joining it to a three-story building that no longer exists. Another engraving by Wening, also published in the 1700 Historico Topographica Descriptio, shows the schloss from the northwest. The main building appears as two separate structures, and the chapel has a rounded apse. The two engravings may represent the building at a different stage of construction. A further representation from 1729 shows the castle in essentially its present form, including a hexagonal fountain depicted by Wening. A view from around 1800 no longer shows the building to the north of the courtyard, and most of an elongated southern farm building show in earlier views is now gone. The fountain in the courtyard has also been removed. Later views show no significant changes.

Direct elections to the Legislative Council became the most debated issue during the public consultations. Under the strong opposition from the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong government consequently turned down the option of the 1988 direct elections and introduced a little change in the government system. Background The reform consultations followed the 1985 electoral reform which introduced the first ever indirect elections to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the 1985 Legislative Council Election. In the White Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong, the idea of direct election was suggested to be reviewed in the development of representative government in 1987. In May 1987, the government published the 1987 Green Paper: Review of Developments in Representative Government to consider the next stage of development of representative government, which could take account into the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in December 1984 which the United Kingdom and People's Republic of China governments agreed upon the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC in 1997. Green Paper A forum on the 1987 Green Paper, attended by 200px The 1987 Green Paper: Review of Developments in Representative Government provided a general review on the development of the government system at district, regional and central levels, assessment of the developments since the publication of the 1984 White Paper and the public response to them, and consideration of the options for further development in 1988. It included the composition, functions and elections of the District Boards, and the municipal councils (Urban Council and Regional Council) and Legislative Council, and whether the Governor should continue to be the President of the Legislative Council. Direct elections to the Legislative Council were listed as one of the options for the representative government in 1988. Public consultation The period of public consultation started from 27 May, the day the Green Paper was published, until 30 September 1987. =Pro-Beijing opinions= The PRC authorities strongly opposed the idea of direction elections to the Legislative Council. On 18 June 1987, the news department of the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch distributed a summary of an interview with Li Hou, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and the secretary general of the Basic Law Drafting Committee. In the interview Li Hou claimed that Hong Kong direct elections in 1988 fail to \\"converge\\" with the Hong Kong Basic Law which was being drafted at that time and were contrary to the \\"spirit\\" of the Sino- British Joint Declaration. Li said direct elections in 1988 would only sharpen the contradictions among different classes and segments of Hong Kong society, which would lead to political, economic, and social instability and would be harmful to a smooth transfer of sovereignty in 1997. However, after a private meeting between Hong Kong Governor David Wilson and PRC Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian on 20 June 1987, Li clarified that he never said the 1988 direct elections did not conform the spirit of Sino-British Joint Declaration. During the summer and fall of 1989, the local pro-Beijing organs and figures such as the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce joined forces with conservative business elites to actively oppose the introduction of direct election, which they argued would only undermine Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Some unionists from the leftist Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) even coined the slogan that \\"Hong Kong workers only want their meal tickets but not ballot tickets.\\" It was also reported that the Bank of China arranged for its employees to watch a video narrated by Ma Lik, who was the then deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee, explaining why the introduction of direct elections was a British conspiracy. The Bank of China also prepared a printed pro-forma opposing letter for its employees to sign and send to the Survey Office. Consequently, the pro-Beijing supporters mobilised 60,706 written submissions to the Hong Kong government objecting the 1988 direct elections, in which 50,175 came on cyclostyled forms and 22,722 were from the communist-controlled FTU. =Pro-democracy opinions= The pro-democracy activists, as well as pressure groups and local academic critics criticised Li Hou's statement represented PRC officials intimidating against Hong Kong people, direct interfering with the internal administration of Hong Kong, and violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration which stated that the British were responsible for the administration of Hong Kong until 1997 and the post-1997 Hong Kong SAR legislature should be constituted by elections. The largest pro-democracy alignment, the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government which was formed in October 1986 bring together 190 organisations, launched series of campaign for the 1988 direct elections including the collection of 220,000 signatures with names and identity card numbers. This behaviour of Hong Kong public was considered \\"a significant development in a society which traditionally avoided personal identification with a particular course of political action.\\" =Public opinions= A longitudinal survey was conducted at four points in 1987. General endorsement of public endorsement of direct elections in 1988 was measured at 54 percent, 54 percent, 49 percent and 46 percent in the four phases, which double the percentage of people who disagreed with direct election, 16 percent, 17 percent, 23 percent and 21 percent. The decline in popular support for the direct elections were due to the opposition from the PRC government, the business sector and the pro-Beijing organisations such as the FTU. During the four-month period of public consultation, over 134,000 submissions were sent to the Survey Office, as well as in nearly 170 public opinion surveys and over 20 signature campaigns. Among the submissions, nearly 96 percent commenting on the issue of direct elections. White Paper In February 1988, the Hong Kong government published the White Paper: the Development of Representative Government: The Way Forward which stressed \\"prudent and gradual change.\\" The Report did not distinguish between pre- printed forms and individual submissions and compressed the 220,000 signatures collected by the democrats as one single count. The official line was there was a strong public desire for further development of government, but there was no clear consensus timing or the extent of the introduction of direct elections. However, the White Paper promised that at least 10 of the 56 members of the Legislative Council would be directly elected in the 1991 Legislative Council Election. In the interim, two more functional constituencies, Accountancy and Health Care enlarged from Financial and Medical respectively, were suggested to be added in the 1988 Elections for the accountancy professions and nurses, midwives, pharmacists and five paramedical professions. The number of appointed members was recommended to reduce from 22 to 20. Furthermore, the preferential elimination system of voting was also favoured to be adopted in both the electoral college and functional constituency elections to the Legislative Council. The Urban Council would be increased from 30 to 30 members in 1989 including 15 appointed and 15 directly elected members remaining unchanged and 10 new members from the District Boards while the composition of the Regional Council remained the same. To response to the Beijing government, it also acknowledge the need for a \\"convergence\\" between Hong Kong internal developments before 1997 and the future Basic Law. Governor David Wilson recalled events thus: The democrats criticised the Hong Kong government of manipulating the submissions to turn down the 1988 direct elections in order to please Beijing. =Legislative Council motion= In March 1988, Chief Secretary Sir David Robert Ford moved the motion regarding the White Paper, the members of the Legislative Council ferociously debated on the issue and were divided by their views on the White Paper.

Once one of the city's harbours, it is now popular for its restaurants, beer gardens and river boats. Etymology Schlachte is a Low German word for a river bank reinforced with wooden piles driven in by the action of hammering (cf. German eingeschlagenen). The word slait was used as early as 1250 to refer to the river bank in Bremen. History Woodcut by Hans Weigel (c. 1550) In 1247, following authorisation from Archbishop Gerhard II, the area between St Martini's Church and Zweite Schlachtpforte (a street meaning \\"second quayside gate\\") was settled by local citizens and traders. In 1250, those privileged to operate water mills were required to maintain the wooden piles used to reinforce the river bank. In the 13th century, both the Schlachte and the Balge were used as harbours for wood (used as firewood) and limestone although the banks of the Balge soon became Bremen's main port. Both harbours were used until the 16th century, the Balge for sea-going ships and the Schlachte for flat-bottomed vessels and river barges.Hill (2004), 265 As a result of the silting of the Weser in the early 17th century, the Schlachte became Bremen's main harbour until the beginning of the 19th century. The appearance of the Schlachte on the woodcut (pictured) from c. 1550 clearly shows a quayside with timber reinforcement although a little later a stone structure was substituted. In 1557, the Schlachte officially became part of the city of Bremen. From 1600 to 1830, there was little change in the appearance of the Schlachte and the rare changes harbour equipment were to the great cranes. It stretched from St Martini Church to the Kornhaus. On the town side, it was bordered by a row of half-timbered houses.Lydia Niehoff, „Zum goldenen Anker“ - Bier schenken in den Schenken an der Schlachte, in: Christian Marzahn/Astrid Schneider (Hrsg.), Genuß und Mäßigkeit, Beiträge zur Sozialgeschichte Bremens, Heft 17, Edition Temmen, Bremen 1995, , pp. 29-52. An increase in freight in the first half of the 19th century brought about a modest extension to the Schlachte but the arrival of the railway in 1860 brought major changes to Bremen's harbours, especially after Bremerhaven was connected to the rail network in 1862. Thereafter, the Schlachte played no further part as a harbour for the city. 20th-century development As the offices and storerooms in the buildings along the Schachte had not been used for decades, at the end of the 20th century it was decided to undertake a comprehensive transformation of the area, given its attractive location on the riverside. Following the introduction of a pedestrian zone in 1985, between 1993 and 2000 many of the buildings were rebuilt under the \\"Stadt am Fluss\\" (Town on the River) chapter of Expo 2000. The cog Roland von Bremen The lower level of the Schlachte was extended upstream and downstream as a modern promenade connected to paths leading into the old town. As a result, it became possible to walk some two kilometres along the riverside. Thereafter, the upstream section from Erste Schlachtpforte (first quayside gate) to the Bürgermeister Smidt Bridge was transformed into a promenade with a historic flair. The ground floors of former warehouses were converted into restaurants, bars and pubs with extensive open-air seating. Modern berths with moorings for several ships were introduced, accommodating the Friedrich and the Roland von Bremen, copied from the remains of a 14th-century cog discovered in 1962. In 1996, a pedestrian footbridge was built connecting the Schlachte to the Teerhof peninsula in the middle of the River Weser. The promenade was further extended downstream from the Bürgermeister Smidt Bridge to the Diepenau corner in 2008. The Schlachte today A number of ships moored along the Schlachte offer river tours up and down the River Weser. There are also landing stages available for those visiting the city in their pleasure craft. The restaurants on the promenade or on board some of the ships on the quayside offer both local dishes and specialities from more exotic regions. Accommodation is available at the youth hostel and on hotel ships. There are also a number of special events in the summer months including a regatta, flea markets and a barbecue festival.

John Moody, 1792 engraving Life The son of a hairdresser named Cochran, he was born in Cork, and followed his father's occupation; his own account was that he was born in Stanhope Street, Clare Market, London. To the end of his life he claimed to be a Londoner. Perhaps to avoid being a forced recruit at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745, he went to Jamaica. Returning to England as Moody, with some property and acting experience, he went on the Norwich circuit. He took the lead in both tragedy and comedy. Tate Wilkinson claimed to have been, 20 June 1759, at Portsmouth, Lord Townly in The Provoked Husband (John Vanburgh and Colley Cibber) to Moody's Manly, with Moody having just arrived from Jamaica.

After the insurrection started, he volunteered to fight. He took part in numerous battles and skirmishes, and after the capitulation, in 1832, he emigrated to France. While in Paris he attended military courses and lectures at Sorbonne, studying engineering and drawing, and he also studied several languages at the , all with the aim of participating in an expedition to Egypt.  Military life in Portugal  Since the expedition to Egypt was canceled he then decided to participate in the Portuguese Liberal Wars, joining the Dona Maria Polish Legion. Chełmicki appeared in Porto, to which Dom Miguel was laying siege, and was accepted as second lieutenant to an engineering unit. After the Liberal Wars, Chełmicki also served Queen Christina of Spain in the Carlist Wars, where he was made Knight of the Order of Isabella the Catholic. After the fighting ceased, he remained in the Portuguese army, serving in Elvas – a stronghold located close to the Spanish border – then in colonial holdings in Africa, on Green Cap Islands, and then in continental Portugal again – in Portalegre and Algarve, gradually making his way to the function of brigade general in 1876 and to the division general in the same year. At that time, he discharged responsible functions of the Evora military district commander. After 55 years of service, he retired in 1888.  Family life  Chełmicki married Júlia Hofacker von Moser, daughter of Georg Christoph Heinrich von Moser, consul of Baden-Württemberg in Lisbon, in Portugal, in 1844, at Mártires, and they had five children. One of his sons, also named Józef Chełmicki, was a major in the Portuguese army, and died in 1931. After his wife's death, he married Carlota de Melo Pereira in Algarve. From this marriage he had no children.  Works  Chełmicki was a writer, and he left a few valuable works in Portuguese, the most famous of them the two-volume description of the Cape Verde Islands and Portuguese Guinea. The book, co- authored with Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Viscount of Porto Seguro, titled Corografia Cabo-Verdiana and published in Lisbon in 1841, is valued to this day as one of the earliest depictions of those areas; it includes extensive data about plants and animals. It is illustrated by lithography tables with images of fish and birds based on drawings made by the author, whose name on the title page is \\"Jose Conrado Carlos de Chelmicki, tenente do Corpo de Engenheiros\\". In 1852 Filipe Folque, the leading nineteenth century Portuguese cartographer and head of the Portugal’s map-making Department from 1848 to 1874, was promoted to Head of the General Office of Geodesic, Topography and Cadastral Works. Due to the lack of experienced engravers in Portugal he hired, in France, the Polish lithographer Jan Nepomucen LewickiNote: Jan Nepomucen Lewicki (1795–1871), Polish graphic artist, engraver, lithographer, painter and photographer and made him responsible for the drawing and lithography of the maps.

Universidad de Barcelona In 1841, Chelmicki was commissioned by the Portuguese Government to author a book on the famous Lisbon aqueduct and at the end of his military career, he published his major works on the issue of Portuguese defense system. He was co-founder of the science-oriented military magazine entitled \\"Revista Militar\\", which exists up to this day, and author of numerous publications. Despite his strong relationship to his new home country of Portugal, Józef Chełmicki did not lose contact with the Polish emigration in France. He authored a very diligently prepared list of books and manuscripts which he encountered in the former Royal Library in Lisbon.  Death and honors  Józef Chełmicki died in Tavira, Portugal, on 28 June 1890. In 2006 the city of Tavira honored Józef Chełmicki naming a street after him.  Other Polish military in Portugal  Polish military men of all ranks, up to generals, fought for Belgium, France, Spain, Hungary and Turkey. Some of them reached Portugal, where they fought and were decorated for achievements. They did this, however, for their own reasons, on their own initiative, and using ways which remain unknown. Before 1939, colonel Ferreira Lima, Portuguese historian and expert on Polish–Portuguese relations, researched the participation of Polish soldiers in the civil war between Dom Pedro and Dom Miguel, and managed to mention 25 Polish military men, who fought under the banner of Queen Mary. Some of them included: * Jan Józef Urbański, who reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel and was awarded the Torre e Espada order, the highest military decoration in Portugal. * Franciszek Michałowski, known to have left Portuguese service during the Revolutions of 1848. * Alojzy Rola-Dzierżawski, also a colonel, distinguished with the Order of Cavalier’s Cross of Christ, who died in 1851. * Norbert Rudzki, who became prominent in Angola in 1854. One hundred years later, in a place where he landed, the memorial chapel was built to celebrate his merits as the founder of Porto Alexandre. In 1936, in Vila Nova de Gaia, the brave poles that defended the City of Oporto, during the Portuguese Liberal Wars, in the battle of \\"Serra do Pilar\\", were honored with a street being named after them: \\"Rua dos Polacos\\".  Medals and decorations  * Knight (CavTE) of the Military Order of the Tower and Sword, of Valour, Loyalty and Merit (Portuguese: Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada do Valor, Lealdade e Mérito), the pinnacle of the Portuguese honours system. * Knight of the Military Order of Christ (Portugal), former Knights Templar order in Portugal * Knight of the Order of Isabella the Catholic.

The sleeve notes gave \\"special thanks to Don Arden and the Gang\\". The album was released for the first time on CD in Japan in 1999. Notable tracks include \\"My Man and Me\\", a top 40 hit for de Paul and her smoochy, laid back version of \\"Dancin' (on a Saturday Night)\\", which had previously been an international hit for her co- writer, Barry Blue. \\"My Man and Me\\" was covered in 2013 by Japanese singer \\"Beautiful Hummingbird\\" as a track on her self titled album.

The school then re-opened on 19 June 1964 under the name George Pringle School by Richard Hearne, known under the stage name of Mr Pastry. The site was made up of several semi-permanent buildings and a large permanent building that was formerly the site of RAF Durrington. In 1997 an additional block, named Hunter Block, was built with four new classrooms. In 2006 the school underwent major redevelopment and had a large extension build on the main building that was originally the site used for RAF Durrington, removed the semi-permanent buildings and extended the car park.

Coetzee (1993, pp.38–9) provides transcripts of the death notices for Versfeld's father and for Versfeld himself which state his name as 'Robert Loftus Owen Versfeld'. (7 December 1862 – 5 May 1932) was a South African rugby union player and administrator who was a founding member of the Eastern Province Rugby Union and of the Pretoria Rugby Subunion (1908) which in 1938 became Northern Transvaal. He founded Pretoria Rugby Club in 1888, and established Pretoria rugby headquarters at Eastern Sports Grounds. He introduced grass playing fields to the Transvaal. Versfeld is the only South African player to have won a Grand Challenge Cup in three different provinces with three different teams: the inaugural Western Province Grand Challenge Cup with Hamilton Rugby Football Club in 1883; the Eastern Province Grand Challenge Cup with Union RFC in 1888; and the Transvaal Grand Challenge Cup with Pretoria RFC in 1889. He also played for a Transvaal Country XV against Bill MacLagan's touring British Isles side in 1891.  Early life and family Loftus Versfeld was born at Constantia, South Africa as the third child to Marthinus Versveld (sic, 8 November 1815 - 5 January 1870) and Johanna Hillegonda Carolina Owen. The Versfelds (spelled 'Versfelt' or 'Versveld' prior to 1870) came from ancient Dutch stock which can probably be traced back to a Gerald Versfeld who in 1200 lived near Zevenaar in the Netherlands. The progenitor of the South African Versfelds was William Ferdinand Versfelt (1745–87), who came to the Cape in 1773 as secretary to his nephew, Peter Baron Van Rheede, Lord of Oudshoorn, designated governor. Baron van Rheede died on the journey to the Cape of Good Hope. Loftus had an older sister, Helen Elizabeth (b.1861), and was the second of five brothers; Marthinus (b.1860), Jan Hendrik (b. 1864), Charles (b. 1866), and Willem (1870).  Rugby career  Hasie. Sitting: Oupa and Loftus Loftus and three of his five brothers, John, Marthinus (Oupa), and Charles (Hasie) all played rugby for Hamilton RFC. In 1885 all four were in the Hamilton side that won the inaugural WP Grand Challenge Cup. In the same year they were on the Combined Cape Town team that competed in the first interprovincial competition at Grahamstown. Loftus was later named as a life-member of Hamiltons. Versfeld moved to Murraysburg, where he practiced law, and then to Uitenhage, where he still lives in 1886. He not only helped start the Union Club, but also the Eastern Province Rugby Union. He was on Union's 1888 team that won the inaugural Eastern Province Grand Challenge Cup. In 1888 Versfeld moved to Pretoria, and started the Good Hope Football Club, which later became Pretoria Rugby Football Club, \\"the oldest Rugby Football Club in the Transvaal\\". He was the captain of Pretoria's 1889 team which won the first Transvaal Grand Challenge Cup. Although rugby had been played in Pretoria since 1887, it had never been formally organized. Versfeld was the captain of Pretoria's 1889 team which won the first Transvaal Grand Challenge Cup. Versfeld and his three brothers all faced Bill MacLagan's 1891 British tourists. Hasie and Oupa played alongside John in a Cape Town XV. Hasie became the first South African to score a try against an international touring side in Cape Town's 1-15 loss at Newlands on 9 July 1891. Tries then had a value of only 1 point, and Hasie's try was the only point scored against the Brits on their entire 1891 tour. Marthinus (3 caps) and Charles (1 cap) went on to represent South Africa's national team. Loftus was in the Transvaal Country Districts XV who on 15 August 1891 lost 0-22 to the British in Johannesburg. His teammates included the future Boer general Christiaan Beyers, \\"one of the leading players in Pretoria, a powerful forward, who led the van in rushes\\". Versfeld retired from playing rugby in 1897, and became President of Pretoria RC. He started the Pretoria Rugby Subunion in 1908 of which he became the second President, following Fred Hopley. In recognition of his contributions to rugby Versfeld was named life-member of the subunion and eventually of the Transvaal Rugby Union. In 1919-20 he used imported kikuyu grass from Kenya to produce the first grass rugby field in the Transvaal. Loftus Versfeld suffered a fatal heart attack while watching a Currie Cup fixture between Transvaal and the Free State at Ellis Park Stadium on 5 May 1932. His son, Wilfred, became President of the Northern Transvaal Rugby Union from its inception in 1938 until 1950. A year after Loftus' death the Eastern Sports Grounds - where Versfeld established rugby headquarters in Pretoria - were renamed Loftus Versfeld in his honour.

The film stars Spencer Lofranco, Mary-Louise Parker, Taissa Farmiga, Ving Rhames, and James Woods. It tells the true story of ex-convict James Burns. The film was released in North America on January 3, 2014 through video on demand, and in a limited release on January 17, 2014 by Phase 4 Films. Plot James Burns is in prison for selling guns, drug possession and illegal possession of a firearm. Some years earlier, his mother Tracy attempts to enroll him in school, but he is turned away due to his past in juvenile detention. One night, James meets Crystal and Drew after they steal from a convenience store, and befriends them. Crystal tells James about Roc, a guy they do illegal odd jobs for and offers him a chance to get in on it. James' mother finds out and reminds him that they are close to his legal appeal, but he defies his incarceration by cutting off his ankle bracelet. James goes to Roc's house asking how he can make money. Roc propositions James to be his getaway driver, then offers a chance to work for him full-time. Later, James and Crystal are horsing around in a convenience store; when James tries to buy cigarettes and liquor, the cashier, Sarah, tells him to take it as she does not want trouble. Drew and James go to a strip club and Drew points out a man who owes Roc money. Bursting into the man's office, James pulls a gun on him but his thugs break in and beat him up. In the parking lot, James busts the windows out of the man's car and finds a bag of guns. Afterward, James runs into Roc, who orders him to fix the situation. Meanwhile, James befriends Sarah and begins a relationship with her. He then tries to leave Roc's crew, but Roc tells James that there is a deal going down that night and guilt trips him into going. James and Drew show up to sell the guns he stole, but the police arrive. James escapes to Sarah's house and tells her to pack so they can leave town together. She refuses, leaving him to face his crimes. In the present day, James makes an enemy in Guillermo, who picks on a new inmate, Chris Cesario. Later, Guillermo's gang attempts to stab James in the shower; during the fight, Chris is mortally wounded instead. James has nightmares from the incident, and takes up poetry in order to block out prison. Worried about Chris, James goes to Lt. Falton to request that Chris be taken out of the yard until his hearing, but Falton refuses. The next day, Guillermo tries to start a fight, but James refuses to join in. Weeks later, Chris hangs himself in the hallway after getting another six years on his sentence. Out of anger, James beats up Guillermo. Later, James starts a fight in the yard, but fellow inmate Conrad breaks it up by telling James that he needs to keep to himself because of his upcoming hearing. At his hearing, James admits regret over Chris' death and his past decisions; he is subsequently released from prison and gets a job as a janitor. One night, an old acquaintance comes by and offers him some work, but he turns it down. Arriving at Sarah's convenience store, he finds it boarded up. He goes to Sarah's house, but her father says she has moved out. He finds her at a new house that she shares with her fiancé. The two talk about their lives, and James says he may move to New York City. At Sarah's request, he recites some of his poetry for her.

On Metacritic, the film garnered an approval score of 29 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"The core of Jamesy Boy – a juvenile delinquent's inside-the-pen coming of age – follows a too-familiar trajectory: Due to the toxic mix of broken family and corruptive friends, James Burns (Spencer Lofranco) has already earned a tracking device on his ankle and an impressive rap sheet boasting robbery, vandalism, assault and firearm possession.\\" David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, writing, \\"For an independent film, Jamesy Boy has a distinguished cast, including Ving Rhames, Mary-Louise Parker, and James Woods. But it's an unknown, Spencer Lofranco, who makes this gritty chronicle, based on a true story, so memorable... For such a seriously street film, Jamesy Boy has some surprisingly sappy moments. But the redemptive ending, while thin, is genuinely gratifying.\\" The Hollywood Reporter critic John DeFore wrote, \\"A true story of a young con who turned his life around, Trevor White's Jamesy Boy wants very much to be inspirational. But nothing the first- time helmer tries – not casting big names in small parts, not scrambling the timeline, not casting a newcomer (Spencer Lofranco) whose swept-back coif recalls James Dean (even if nothing else about him does) – can keep the tale from feeling like one cribbed from a score of other second-chance films.

The manga was created around 1924–1927 as 52 \\"episodes\\", each a two-page spread intended for serialization in a Japanese- language newspaper. In 1927, the originals were exhibited at San Francisco's Golden Gate Institute. In 1931, it was self published in San Francisco as a one-shot manga. It was republished in Japan by Shimpu in August 2012. It was translated into English by Frederik L. Schodt and was published by Stone Bridge Press as The Four Immigrants Manga: A Japanese Experience in San Francisco 1904–1924 in October 1998. In summer 2017, it was adapted into The Four Immigrants: An American Musical Manga at TheatreWorks (Silicon Valley). Development The manga drew from the experiences of Kiyama and his three friends when they were college-age Japanese immigrants to San Francisco between 1904 and 1924. The year 1924 is chosen as it was when the \\"immigration laws stiffened and some of the protagonists elected to return to Japan\\". Inspired by western comic strips, Hiyama drew Four Immigrants with each episode in a two-page spread, ending at 52 episodes for a year's worth of weekly newspaper comic strips. Jason Thompson notes that \\"each strip has sort of a punchline, but also tells a story; it's not so different from reading a yonkoma manga in which the story is broken up for gags every four panels.\\" Kiyama tried to have Four Immigrants serialized by a Japanese-language newspaper in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful. In 1927, Kiyama exhibited the pages of the manga in a gallery of San Francisco's Kinmon Gakuen (Golden Gate Institute), with the exhibition titled \\"A Manga North American Immigrant History\\" (Manga Hokubei Iminshi). The manga covered the immigrants' arrival and quarantine on Angel Island as well as major events of the time: 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Panama–Pacific International Exposition of 1915 and the 1918 flu pandemic with criticism of \\"several Congressional acts designed to curtail Asian immigration.\\" Most of the manga \\"concentrates on student immigrant experiences prior to the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907\\". In 1931, Kiyama had the book printed in Japan, then self-published it in San Francisco. Kiyama had the immigrants speak in Meiji era Japanese, with the Americans speaking in broken English and the Chinese speaking in Cantonese. In his translation, Frederik L. Schodt had kept the Americans speaking broken English, with the immigrants speaking in perfect English. This had the effect of \\"[helping] readers see the Japanese characters as \\"us\\" and the Americans as weird, frequently baffling foreigners, consistent with the general viewpoint of the comic.\\" Schodt found Kiyama's work in 1980 in University of California's East Asian Library. He began translating the work in 1997, which was published by Stone Bridge Press in October 1998. Through interviewing Kiyama's surviving relatives in Japan and studying his private papers and artwork, Schodt concludes that the characters Charlie, Frank and Fred \\"are roughly based on the people that Kiyama knew.\\" He further claims that the manga is the \\"first journalistic comic books\\". Racism between the immigrants and the locals was predominantly between Japanese immigrants and American locals, however \\"racial animosity . . . existed between Chinese and Japanese immigrants in the United States.\\" Garrity comments on the prevalence of racism of that era: \\"a hundred years ago, everyone, of every background, was openly and casually racist.\\" The \\"four immigrants [refer] to white people as keto and black people as kuroto.\\" Reception Manga Critic's Katherine Dacey writes that the manga's \\"visual style and subject matter may not strike contemporary readers as manga-esque ... but the intimate quality of the stories will leave as lasting an impression as graphic memoirs such as Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis and Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home.\\" Time's Andrew Arnold praises the manga as \\"a book to be enjoyed by readers of history and comix.\\" \\"This once- lost artifact,\\" he continues, \\"works as both a delightful read and a reminder of where Americans come from and who we are now.\\" Jason Thompson writes that the manga is \\"frozen in time with diligent documentary-style realism, with cynical humor and cartoony cheer\\". Shaenon K. Garrity applauds the manga as a \\"historical artifact and a milestone in the evolution of comics\\" and says Schodt's translation provides \\"historical background and [explains] all the untranslatable puns\\". Harvard Asia Pacific Review commends Kiyama's \\"keen insight into the workings of society, especially into Japanese-American interaction.\\" Booklist's Gordon Flagg comments that the manga is \\"a fascinating cultural document of an era of great interest to scholars of Asian American culture. Since it is apparently the first U.S. comic book consisting of original material instead of reprinted newspaper strips, it is also of interest to students of American comics. Writing in American Studies International, Robert Humphrey commends Kiyama for his \\"gentle humor that appeals to readers of all cultures . . . [since] his cartoons are not only informative about their own time period, they remain funny in ours\\". Michael Boatwright, writing for the Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, comments on Kiyama's emphasis on the characters' \\"cartoon-like features\\" with the usage of \\"simplistic lines and circles\\", which \\"readers to identify more readily with characters.\\" Kom Kunyosying draws a parallel between the manga and Mikhail Bakhtin's essay Epic and Novel as they are both \\"anti-genre\\", which \\"achieves much of what other forms cannot, including an ability to engage with contemporary reality, and an ability to re-conceptualize the individual in a complex way that interrogates his subjectivity and offers the possibility of redefining his own image.\\" Brian Hayashi criticizes the manga for its \\"strong upper-class bias\\" and that Schodt did not account for the difference in treatment of Japanese students and Japanese immigrants in general. AnimeFringe's Janet Houck commends the characters for not being \\"depressive\\" and for bringing \\"their own unique spin on how to be successful in California, from farming rice to investing in banks to gambling.\\" Jeff Chon of Sequart comments that the manga \\"isn’t just a shared piece of history between comics fans, but a bit of cultural and personal history we as Americans need to share more often.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Autobiographical anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Books about the San Francisco Bay Area Category:1931 manga Category:One-shot manga Category:History of San Francisco ","title":"The Four Immigrants Manga"},{"id":"41565202","text":"Supranivka is a village in Pidvolochysk Raion of Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine.

He represented District 82, encompassing parts of Franklin, Crawford, and Madison counties, as a Republican in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 2013 to 2016. Early life and education Gossage graduated in 1979 with dual bachelor's degrees in History and Political Science from Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. In 1991, he received a master's degree in Counseling from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Since 2001, he had been an assistant superintendent in the Ozark School District. Previously from 1993 to 2001, he was a high school principal and counselor for the Ozark system. From 1981 to 1992, he was a counselor for the County Line School District, also located in Franklin County. Political career In 2010, Post had been elected by default when the Republican candidate, Thomas Lile \\"Tom\\" Fite (born 1944), was disqualified from the ballot by a judge in Pulaski County who declared that Fite's guilty plea in 1984 to Medicaid fraud constituted an \\"infamous crime.\\" Though Tom Fite's name remained on the ballot, his votes were not counted. In 2012, Fite's wife, Republican Charlene Fite, an educator from Van Buren, won the reconfigured District 80 seat encompassing parts of Crawford and Washington counties. In 2012, he was unopposed for the Republican nomination in House District 82. The seat opened when Republican Lori Benedict ran for reelection in reconfigured District 61 but was defeated by the Democrat Scott Balz. Gossage himself unseated the previous representative from District 83, the Democrat Leslee Milam Post, 6,804 votes (63.5 percent) to 3,909 (36.5 percent). Gossage served on these House committees: (1) Advanced Communications and Information Technology, (2) Aging, Children and Youth, Legislative and Military Affairs, and (3) Revenue and Taxation. He voted to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation requiring photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; he was a co-sponsor of both of these bills. Gossage supported other pro-life measures too: to ban abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make the death of an unborn child a felony in certain cases. On Second Amendment matters, Gossage co-sponsored legislation to allow concealed carry firearms on church and university properties and to prevent the governor from regulating firearms in an emergency. He co-sponsored legislation to amend state income tax rates. He voted for a spending cap on the state budget, but the measure failed by two House votes. He voted to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. He voted for the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. He backed a measure to prohibit the closure of public schools after a two-year enrollment decline, but the measure was defeated on the House floor. Gossage endorsed former U.S. Representative Asa Hutchinson for governor in the 2014 Republican primary. Hutchinson went on to win his nomination and then to defeat the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Mike Ross. He resigned from the Arkansas House of Representatives on August 30, 2016 to become Governor Hutchinson's deputy chief of staff for external operations. Personal life Gossage is a member of the Assembly of God Church in Paris in Logan County. He is also affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce, Gun Owners of America, the National Rifle Association, the Farm Bureau, and the Cattleman's Association.

In a marine insurance voyage policy, the assured warrants that the vessel is seaworthy. A carrier of goods by sea owes a duty to a shipper of cargo that the vessel is seaworthy at the start of the voyage. A shipowner warrants to a charterer that the vessel under charter is seaworthy; and similarly, a shipbuilder warrants that the vessel under construction will be seaworthy. Statutory seaworthiness – criminal liability The Merchant Shipping Act 1995 makes it a criminal offence to send or attempt to send an unseaworthy ship to sea. Seaworthiness in this context relates to defective structures, equipment, under-manning, overloading etc. and the vessel may be detained. In every contract of employment at sea there is an implied obligation on the owner to ensure the seaworthiness of the ship and an allegation of unseaworthiness may be brought by the crew, though at least five members of the crew are required to bring the action, Seaworthiness in Marine Insurance Under Section 39 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, in a voyage policy there is an implied warranty that the vessel is \\"reasonably seaworthy in all respects\\": S. 39 (1) In a voyage policy there is an implied warranty that at the commencement of the voyage the ship shall be seaworthy for the purpose of the particular adventure insured. (2 )Where the policy attaches while the ship is in port, there is also an implied warranty that she shall, at the commencement of the risk, be reasonably fit to encounter the ordinary perils of the port. (3) Where the policy relates to a voyage which is performed in different stages, during which the ship requires different kinds of or further preparation or equipment, there is an implied warranty that at the commencement of each stage the ship is seaworthy in respect of such preparation or equipment for the purposes of that stage. (4) A ship is deemed to be seaworthy when she is reasonably fit in all respects to encounter the ordinary perils of the seas of the adventure insured. (5) In a time policy there is no implied warranty that the ship shall be seaworthy at any stage of the adventure, but where, with the privity of the assured, the ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, the insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to unseaworthiness. Seaworthiness in Carriage of Goods by Sea=At common law= At common law, when goods are carried by sea by a “common carrier” (a public carrier), then, if the contract of carriage does not contain an exception clause relating to seaworthiness, there is an absolute undertaking that the vessel is seaworthy. Liability is “strict”**, meaning the carrier is liable even in the absence of negligence, as in Liver Alkali v Johnson. This does not mean the vessel need be capable of encountering any peril. The test of seaworthiness may be \\"that the ship should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter in the voyage to be performed\\". However, the strict liability at common law is invariably modified in contracts of affreightment. In charter parties the shipowner may negotiate an express clause excluding his liability for unseaworthiness or he may, as it more usual, agree to incorporate the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 into the charter. =By statute= Article III Rule 1 of the Hague-Visby Rules provides: \\"The carrier shall be bound before and at the beginning of the voyage to exercise due diligence to— (a) Make the ship seaworthy. (b) Properly man, equip and supply the ship. (c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation. Section 3 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 adds: \\" There shall not be implied in any contract for the carriage of goods by sea to which the Rules apply by virtue of this Act any absolute undertaking by the carrier of the goods to provide a seaworthy ship.\\" This provision makes it clear that there is no strict liability to provide a seaworthy ship. McFadden v Blue Star Line (1905)McFadden v Blue Star Line (1905) 1 KB 697 provides that: \\"A vessel must have that degree of fitness which an ordinary careful and prudent owner would require his vessel to have at the commencement of her voyage having regard to all the probable circumstances of it…Would a prudent owner have required that it (i.e. the defect) should be made good before sending his ship to sea, had he known of it? If he would, the ship was not seaworthy…\\" http://www.tamimi.com/en/magazine/law- update/section-6/september-2/a-shipowners-duty-to-provide-a-seaworthy-ship- under-the-charterparty.html Together with the Hague Visby Rules, the common law provides that the concept of \\"seaworthiness\\" covers: the ship, its equipment and supplies,Burges v Wickham (1863) 3 B & S 669Hang Fung Shipping & Trading v Mullion [1966] 1 LL R 511 the crew,Hong Kong Fir Shipping v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha [1962] 2 QB 26 the vessel's suitability for the particular cargo Stanton v Richardson (1874) LR 9 CP 390 and its suitability for the particular voyage or for particular ports.Thin v Richards [1892] 2 QB 141Ciampa v British India Co [1915] 2 B 774 The Rotterdam Rules, which are intended to replace the Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules, are many years away from ratification. If and when the Rotterdam Rules come into force, the carrier will have to maintain seaworthiness throughout the voyage, not just at the start. Presumably the standard of seaworthiness at sea would be somewhat lower than when in port (where refit facilities are available).\\"Rotterdam Rules The: A Practical Annotation\\" - (2009) -ed. Yvonne Batz - Institute of Maritime Law /Informa Seaworthiness in Chartering A shipowner will normally owe the following duties to the charterer:http://www.tamimi.com/en/magazine/law- update/section-6/september-2/a-shipowners-duty-to-provide-a-seaworthy-ship- under-the-charterparty.html#sthash.NYCXqvF6.dpuf #To provide a seaworthy ship which complies with the charterparty description; #To properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, discharge and deliver the cargo; #To comply with charterers’ legitimate employment instructions; #To prosecute voyages with reasonable dispatch. In Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha,Hong Kong Fir Shipping v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha [1962] 2 QB 26 the ship's unsatisfactory team of engineers meant that the vessel was unseaworthy, and the consequent delay in delivery amounted to serious deviation. However, in a controversial judgment, the court held that the charterer could not cancel and was entitled only to damages, since neither breach denied the claimant of the main benefit of the contract. Seaworthiness in Shipbuilding Contracts Shipbuilding contracts will normally be effected using a standard form contract. However, the common law \\"business efficacy rule\\" in The MoorcockThe Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64 may require that seaworthiness is an implied term of the contract. Also, sections 13 & 14 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 require (respectively) that \\"the goods\\", (the ship), \\"comply with description\\" and shall be of \\"satisfactory quality\\".

Crandell, a fifth-generation rural Arizonan and rancher, had served in the Legislature since 2011. Education Crandell was born in Holbrook, Arizona in 1946, and earned his BS in agricultural education from University of Arizona and his MEd in from Northern Arizona University. Elections *2012 Redistricted to District 6, and with incumbent Republican Senator Lori Klein redistricted to District 1, Crandell was unopposed for the Senate District 6 August 28, 2012 Republican Primary, winning with 17,089 votes; and won the November 6, 2012 General election with 45,105 votes against Democratic Representative Tom Chabin. *2010 With House District 5 incumbent Democratic Representative retiring and Republican Representative Bill Konopnicki running for Arizona Senate and leaving both seats open, Crandell ran in the three-way August 24, 2010 Republican Primary and placed second with 9,975 votes; in the four-way November 2, 2010 General election, fellow Republican nominee Brenda Barton took the first seat and Crandell took the second seat with 30,890 votes ahead of Democratic nominees Bill Shumway and Prescott Winslow. Sponsored legislation In 2014, Crandell sponsored SB1093, which would have required federal law enforcement and other agencies doing business in an Arizona county to register with and present a warrant to the county sheriff. The proposed bill also stipulated that half of all fines imposed by the federal government must be turned over to Arizona's general fund. The bill was rejected by the Senate Rules Committee, which voted 4–2 against it after its attorney said that it would likely violate the Constitution. The American Conservative Union gave him an evaluation of 92%. Death He was found dead August 4, 2014, after failing to return from a horseback ride near Heber-Overgaard. He was 68. According to the Navajo County Sheriff's Office, Crandell had left for a one-hour ride at about 10 a.m. on what investigators were told was a new colt. When he did not return, family members searched the area where he was riding and at about 2 p.m. found him dead. The horse was found in the area.

This disorder can develop when marathon runners or endurance event athletes drink more fluid, usually water or sports drinks, than their kidneys can excrete. This excess water can severely dilute the level of sodium in the blood needed for organs, especially the brain, to function properly. The incidence of EAH in athletes has increased in recent years, especially in the United States, as marathon races and endurance events have become more popular. A recent study showed 13% of the Boston 2002 marathon runners experienced EAH; most cases were mild. Eight deaths from EAH have been documented since 1985. Symptoms Symptoms may be absent or mild for the early onset of EAH and can include impaired exercise performance, nausea, vomiting, headache, bloating, and swelling of hands, legs, and feet.Noakes, T. Waterlogged: The Serious Problem of Overhydration in Endurance Sports. Human Kinetics, 2012. As water retention increases, weight gain may also occur. More severe symptoms include pulmonary edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. Symptoms of hyponatremic encephalopathy are associated with an altered level of consciousness and can include sullenness, sleepiness, withdrawing from social interaction, photophobia, and seizures. Causes  The primary causes of EAH include excessive fluid retention during exercise with a significant sodium deficit and excessive fluid intake leading to an increase in total body water resulting in a reduction in blood sodium levels. Athlete-specific risk factors are: being of female sex; use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]; slow running; excessive fluid ingestion; low body weight; and event inexperience. Event-specific risk factors are: high availability of drinking fluids; duration of exercise exceeds 4 hours; unusually hot environmental conditions; and extreme cold temperature. Mechanism Sodium is an important electrolyte needed for maintaining blood pressure. Sodium is mainly found in the body fluids that surround the cells and is necessary for nerves, muscles, and other body tissues to function properly. Many factors may contribute to the development of EAH. Under normal conditions, sodium and water levels are regulated by the renal and hormonal systems. The decrease in sodium levels can occur due to a defect in the renal and hormonal systems, an overwhelming increase in water consumption and excessive loss of sodium through sweating. When the sodium levels outside of the cells decrease, water moves into the cells. The cells begin to increase in size. When several cells in one area begin to increase in size, swelling occurs in the affected area. Swelling is commonly observed in hands, legs, and feet. Sodium is also important in regulating the amount of water that passes through the blood-brain barrier. Decreased sodium blood levels result in increased permeability of water across the blood-brain barrier.Murray, B., Stofan, J., and Eichner, R. \\"SSE #88: Hyponatremia in Athletes.\\" Gatorade Sports Science Institute. (2003). This increased influx of water causes brain swelling which leads to severe neurological symptoms. Diagnosis EAH is categorized by having a blood serum or plasma sodium level below normal, which is less than 135 mmol/l. Asymptomatic EAH is not normally detected unless the athlete has had a sodium blood serum or plasma test. Hyponatremic encephalopathy may be detect using brain imaging studies and pulmonary edema may be confirmed by x-ray. Prevention Traditional prevention of EAH focuses on reducing fluid consumption to avoid fluid retention before, during, and after exercise. However, since this can risk dehydration, an alternative approach is possible of consuming a substantial amount of salt prior to exercise. It is still important not to overconsume water to the extent of requiring urination, because urination would cause the extra salt to be excreted. = The Role of Thirst = In a published statement of the Third International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference, researchers concluded that drinking in accordance with the sensation of thirst is sufficient for preventing both dehydration and hyponatremia. This advice is contradicted by the American College of Sports Medicine, which has previously recommended athletes drink \\"as much as tolerable. In October of 2015, ACSM President W. Larry Kenney stated that “[T]he clear and important health message should be that thirst alone is not the best indicator of dehydration or the body’s fluid needs.” In a letter to the editors of The Journal of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, Brad L. Bennett, PhD claimed \\"perpetuation of the myth that one needs to drink beyond the dictates of thirst can be deadly.\\" Similarly, authors of the Statement of the Third International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference claim this advice has \\"facilitated inadvertent overdrinking and pathological dilutional EAH.\\" Critics of the ACSM's view have questioned their motives, pointing out that Gatorade is one of the organizations \\"platinum sponsors.\\" Treatment  Treatments are focused on the underlying cause of hyponatremia and include *fluid restriction *0.9% saline and hypertonic saline intravenously *100 ml of 3% saline hourly When EAH is treated early, complete recovery is expected. In addition to the above treatments, athletes experiencing EAH encephalopathy may also receive high-flow oxygen and a rapid infusion of 100 ml of 3% NaCl to reduce brain edema. Recent research As the incidence of EAH has increased in recent years, current research has focused on the prevalence of EAH in marathon runners and endurance athletes. One study found 26% of the athletes competing in the Triple Iron ultra- triathlon developed EAH. A similar study measured the prevalence of EAH in open-water ultra-endurance swimmers and found 8% of males and 36% of females developed EAH. Current research has also focused on the determining the most effective treatment for EAH. The data from one study suggests that immediate administration of 100 ml intravenous bolus of 3% hypertonic saline was more effective at normalizing blood sodium levels than oral administration for asymptomatic EAH.

It was a step forward in the development of the genre, as it had a plot and good acting. The movie can be seen as a meditation on voyeurism, due to the trope of Mann being spied on by a private detective hired by her husband, and the production of pornography itself, as the detective films her sexual encounters. Porn film star Bill Margold, who went on to be the director of the Free Speech Coalition, has written that \\"The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann signals an end to the all-balling, no purpose, disposable mastur-movies that go into one orifice and out another.” Filmed in Manhattan, the movie was released in New York City on December 26, 1974 and was nationally distributed in 1975. The film has been inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame. Plot Bourbon plays Pamela Mann, a married psychotherapist living and working in Manhattan who has several sexual encounters that are filmed by a private detective hired by her husband. Mann has sex with one of her patients, a prostitute, and also is kidnapped by a couple of radicals. While the male radical orally rapes Mann, the female radical reads the text of a Supreme Court decision on pornography. She also fellates a man she meets on a park bench. At the climax of the film, Mann is revealed to be watching the detective's films in bed with her husband. They have staged the encounters and the snooping for their own private enjoyment. They then have sex.

According to one film reviewer, Radley Metzger's films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984), are noted for their \\"lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle\\". Another reviewer noted that his films were \\"highly artistic — and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography\\". Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. Remastered version In 2011, DistribPix released a complete remastering of the film, with the full cooperation of the director. The result had a limited exhibition in theaters, but the main outcome of the project was the first-ever official remastered DVD version.

Return on Change works with startups that operate in five sectors, each of which touches on sustainability in some way: cleantech, edtech, life sciences, social enterprises, and technology. An online equity crowdsourcing platform, RoC helps socially conscious ventures raise capital.  History  Sang Lee, CEO and founder and native New Yorker, founded Return on Change in 2012, in anticipation of the JOBS Act. Lee became interested in the idea after working for six years as an investment banker in the power and energy sector and noticing the difficulties that startups in these industries faced when raising money from traditional sources. He created Return on Change, which started helping startups sell equity to accredited investors, or those who make at least $200,000 a year and have $1 million in assets, in the summer of 2013. The platform is among the first to take advantage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS), which passed in 2012. In addition to his work at RoC, Sang is also the Executive Director of CF50, a global crowdfunding leadership think tank.  Equity Crowdfunding  With the passage of the JOBS act, equity crowdfunding, which allows companies to sell equity shares through crowdfunding sites, became legal in 2012. However, the SEC is still reviewing regulations that would allow non-accredited investors to make equity investments.  Operations  Return on Change focuses on high-impact startups and is limited to accredited investors, or those who meet income thresholds according to SEC regulations. RoC was a sponsor of the TechCrunch NYC Meetup and NY Tech Day. The platform is currently preparing for the passage of new regulations that would allow non-accredited investors to participate.  Milestones  In May 2014, cleantech startup Geostellar closed a $1 million round using the RoC platform. Geostellar is an online marketplace for financing and installing solar panels. It is a solar marketplace that aims to map the solar power potential of every residence in the U.S., while demonstrating to homeowners their potential cost savings. “Raising capital online since the JOBS Act makes it much easier to spread the word, get potential investors engaged and provide information,” David Levine, the CEO of Geostellar, said in the company’s announcement.  Press Coverage  Return on Change has become a leader within crowdfunding discourse and has been featured in publications such as BetaBeat, Reuters, Ecopreneurist, and Crains. Forbes wrote about the platform in August 2013.

Life The son of John Delap, of Spilsby in Lincolnshire, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, but migrated to Magdalene College, and was admitted pensioner on 15 March 1743. He took the degrees of B.A. in 1747, M.A. in 1750, and D.D. in 1762, and was described on the last occasion as of Trinity College. On 30 December 1748 he was elected to a fellowship at Magdalene. Delap was ordained in the Church of England, and was once curate to William Mason. The united livings of Iford and Kingston near Lewes in Sussex were conferred on him in 1765, and he became rector of Woollavington in 1774. But he lived at South Street, Lewes, where he died in 1812, aged 87. Delap used to visit Henry and Hester Thrale in Brighton or Tunbridge Wells, so knew Samuel Johnson and Fanny Burney, who found his conversation onerous- Johnson for Delap's obsession with his health, and Burney for the manner in which, despite being \\"commonly and naturally grave, silent, and absent\\", Delap would \\"work... threadbare\\" any subject raised in conversation on which he had anything to say. Works Delap's first work was Marcellus, a Monody, 1751, inspired by the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, inscribed to his widow. It was succeeded by a number of elegies (1760); two which may have been among those were in George Pearch's Collection of Poems. His thesis for his divinity degree (12 April 1762) was published in 1763, Mundi perpetuus administrator Christus. The tragedy Hecuba by Delap was produced at Drury Lane Theatre on 11 December 1761, when the prologue, written by Robert Lloyd, was spoken by David Garrick, who also wrote the epilogue. It was printed anonymously in 1762. Delap wanted Garrick to produce of a tragedy entitled Panthea, in vain. Delap addressed a long letter to him in 1762 in favour of a new composition, The Royal Suppliants; it was accepted, but not acted until 17 Feb. 1781, when it ran for ten nights at Drury Lane, and was published with a dedication to Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston. In 1774 Garrick refused the Royal Exiles. A tragedy The Captives by Delap, was staged at Drury Lane on 9 March 1786, was acted three times, and was published in the same year. An unacted play Gunilda was published in 1786. Delap wrote further verse: * An Elegy on the Death of the Duke of Rutland, 1788; * Sedition, an Ode occasioned by his Majesty's late Proclamation, 1792; and * The Lord of Nile, an Elegy, 1799. Four unacted plays in one volume of Dramatic Poems: Gunilda, Usurper, Matilda, and Abdalla, then appeared in 1803.

It was created on December 13, 1830 by King Louis- Philippe I to thank those who had helped overthrow Charles X and establish a Constitutional monarchy. The order, intended to reward the citizens who were distinguished during the 'Glorious Three Days' (27, 28 and July 29, 1830), included two decorations: the Cross of July and the July Medal.  History  The enabling law envisaged the creation of a special decoration from which the members would profit from the Order. This decoration was created by the ordinance of April 30th, 1831 under the name of the Order of the Cross of July. It was intended for \\"those which were characterized by their devotion to the cause of Freedom.\\" The citizens decorated with the Cross of July took an oath of fidelity to the King and an oath of obedience to the constitutional charter and the kingdom's laws. Military honors were given to the holders of the Cross of July as well as to those of the Légion of Honor. A commission of the national awards, chaired by the General Fabvier, decreed 1,789 crosses, including more than 300 to soldiers.  Design  The Cross is made up of a silver star with three enameled white branches, with the points pommetées and surmounted by a mural crown. The center of the star, formed by a gold medallion, is surrounded by an enameled crown of green oak leaves. The avers, the central medallion, is divided into three aureoles painted with the national colors, and has a French cockerel on the bottom gilded in blue aureole and the words PATRIE ET FREEDOM in red aureole. On the reverse, the central medallion is divided into three aureoles enameled with the national colors. The dates July 27, July 28, and July 29 are on the blue aureole, the year 1830 is on the white aureole and the words GIVEN BY THE ROI FRANCAIS in the red aureole.

A notable work of Borchard's was John Stuart Mill: the Man. Early and personal life Borchard was a cousin of Deborah Layton, survivor and author of Seductive Poison: A Jonestown Survivor's Story of Life and Death in the Peoples Temple. Career She assisted Friedrich Hayek on John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor and later wrote John Stuart Mill: the Man, published in 1957, which was considered by R.J. Halliday to be \\"an amusing and perceptive account of Mill's life and personality.\\" She wrote of his romantic interest, Harriet Taylor, her intellectual influence, and his conversion to Benthamism. Borchard Collection Borchard collected 100 self-portraits of British artists. She started out offering 10–15 guineas and then 21 guineas for artists to provide their self-portraits. Jean Cooke responded to the request saying \\"Dear Miss Borchard, I am not a feminist but to have only three women painters out of 91 makes rather poor odds so 21 gns it is. Are you going to come and pick up the painting?\\" The commission was half her usual rate. Of the total 100 self-portraits, there were only five women. In response to Borchar's request, Michael Ayrton wrote: \\"I will accept the 21gns and I much admire anyone who can obtain so many works for no more than that figure.\\" Borchard began collecting works in 1958 and by 1971 had 100 self-portraits. The British or British-based artists made self-portraits in oil, gouaches, watercolours and one was a bas relief. She wrote that \\"One of the greatest satisfactions of my collection: about one in three of the self-portraits were done because of my request. They would not exist but for that it makes me feel creative at one remove.\\" The collection was shown at the 2003 British Art Fair at the Commonwealth Institute in London.

In August 20 1955, he planned a resistance and struggle against the French occupation in Philippeville (currently called Skikda) and surroundings, which led 123 French soldiers to death. That resistance led to harsh crackdown and repression that caused (officially) 1,239 dead in the Algerian side, and (unofficially) 12,000 according to the FLN party. Zighoud, from whom the town of Zighoud Youcef takes its name, was killed in Sidi Mezghiche during a clash with the French Army.  Biography  Zighoud attended the Quranic school after leaving a French primary school. At the age of 17, Zighoud joined the Algerian People Party (PPA), becoming a local official in Smendou in 1938. After being elected in the Movement of Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTLD) in 1947, he took part of the Special Organization (OS), which was called to prepare all essential requirements to the Armed Struggle, after the total fail of the Pacific way.

It’s in this tenure that he organized and directed the famous August 20 1955’s struggle, “the bloodbath of Constantine region” that was firmly condemned by the FLN head command. A year after, day by day on August 20 1956, he took part the Soummam congress where all organic and political structures of November’s revolution were set up. Zighoud Youcef, who was one of the congress founders, was appointed a member of National Council of the Algerian Revolution (CNRA), and was promoted colonel of National Liberation Army (ALN); and assumed command of the \\"Wilaya II\\".

Local observances during that week include demonstrations of goat milking and hoof trimming, and goat obstacle courses. Background Dairy Goat Awareness Day was first observed in 1986. United States Secretary of Agriculture Richard Edmund Lyng accepted an offering of six baby goats from the American Dairy Goat Association. Legislation In 1987, North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms filed a resolution to set aside a week in June \\"to educate the American people to the potential of dairy goats and their products.\\" The measure was co-sponsored by Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. On June 19, President Ronald Reagan issued Proclamation 5669, designating National Dairy Goat Awareness Week. The President praised dairy goats for their link with American history and their ability to thrive in harsh environments. The United States Congress passed House Joint Resolution 423 in 1988, calling on the President to issue a proclamation declaring the period beginning the second Saturday of June and ending the third Saturday of June as National Dairy Goat Awareness Week. Reagan issued Proclamation 5834, praising the dairy goat's ability to efficiently convert \\"a wide variety of vegetation into nutritious milk and meat\\", and calling on people to observe the holiday with \\"appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\\" In 1990, Governor James Blanchard proclaimed Dairy Goat Awareness Week in Michigan, honoring the 200 herds of registered goats in the state and their owners.

Life and work Lembke was born in Cleveland, Ohio during the Great Depression, graduated in 1953 from Middlebury College, Vermont, with a degree in Classics, and her knowledge of the classical Greek and Latin worldview, from Homer to Virgil, informed her life and work. A Certified Virginia Master Gardener,Janet Lembke entry in Poets & Writers directory she lived in Virginia and North Carolina, drawing inspiration from both locales.

She received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to translate Virgil's Georgics, having already translated Euripides' Electra and Hecuba, and Aeschylus's Persians and Suppliants. Lembke's first book was Bronze and Iron: Old Latin Poetry from Its Beginnings to 100 B.C. (1973), but beyond translations and essays about classics, there were more than a dozen books on nature, works for which the author acquired a base of admirers. Her articles were printed in The New York Times, Sierra Magazine (The Sierra Club), Oxford American, Audubon, Raleigh News and Observer, Southern Review and other publications. The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of \\"taking poetic license too far\\"Criticism of Lembke's translation of The Georgics.

Novelist Annie Proulx expressed a similar perception, observing that \\"Lembke's writing tacks between three points: the stuff of her late-twentieth-century life; the tangle of creature and plant in every dimension of tide and river flow; and the haunting, connecting wires of mythos that still knot us to the ancient beginnings.\\"Annie Proulx on Lembke: Among Lembke's noted titles were Because the Cat Purrs: How We Relate to Other Species and Why It Matters (2008); Skinny Dipping: And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human (2004); Dangerous Birds (1996); River Time (1997); Despicable Species: On Cowbirds, Kudzu, Hornworms, and Other Scourges (1999); and The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well (2004)-- a sober and unflinching account of the death of the author's mother.

Part of the Shell Grotto in Margate A shell grotto is a type of folly, a grotto decorated with sea shells. The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries. It suited the Baroque and Rococo styles (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)Hazelle Jackson, Shell Houses and Grottoes ( 2001) (abstract) and often represented the mimicry of architectural features from the Italian Renaissance (themselves copies from Classical times). The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank undercroft, or provide an antechamber before a piano nobile, but later it became a garden feature independent of the house, sometimes on the edge of a lake, with water flowing through it. History Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a nymphaeum. The shells were often laid out in strict patterns in contemporary decorative styles used for plasterwork and the like. Later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes, sometimes showing the early influence of the Romantic movement. The porch of Scott's Grotto today. The first recorded shell grotto in England was at Whitehall Palace; James I had it built in the undercroft of the Banqueting House in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the Duke of Bedford had a shell room built at Woburn Abbey, featuring shell mosaics and carved stone. This, and another at Skipton Castle, built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century. The shell-free Crystal Grotto at Painshill Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at Oatlands Park cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at Fisherwick Park the Marquess of Donegall spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.

By the end of the 18th century, fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, like the weathered rock and crystal \\"Crystal Grotto\\" at Painshill in Surrey, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.

The film features Vinay in dual lead roles and three newcomers, Samuthrika, Swasthika and Kesha Khambhati, as the female leads, while the director's regular composer Bharathwaj scores the music. The film was shot primarily in Thirunelveli while filming took also place in Hyderabad, Bangkok and Dubai. The film was said to be dealing with money laundering and hawala. The film which began production in December 2012 went through several production delays and released on 22 September 2017. It fared poorly at the box office.  Cast  *Vinay as Senthattikaalai and Sevathakaalai *Samuthrika as Adhirshtamalar *Swasthika as Bhumika *Kesha Khambhati as Urmila Naidu *Pradeep Rawat as Bhima Raju *Sreejith Ravi as Thilak Prabhu *Kaajal Pasupathi as Arundhati *Ilavarasu as Vanarajan *Aruldoss as Mandhiramoorthy *Rethika Srinivas *Mayilsamy *Daniel Annie Pope *Shanoor Sana  Production  In September 2012, it was first reported that Saran had stopped working on the pre-production of Aal, Ambu, Senai, a venture featuring Vishal and chosen to work on a script titled Senthatti Kaalai Sevatha Kaalai with Vinay in the lead role. The film was announced to be jointly produced by Vikram Raju for Vega Entertainment and Saran who would also work on the story, screenplay and direction. Bharathwaj, a regular in Saran's projects, was signed on to compose the music while three new girls called Samuthrika, Kadambari Jethwani and Shilpi Verma were signed on to play pivotal roles. Production began in December 2012 in Thirunelveli, and posters from a photo shoot featuring Vinay in dual roles were released later in February 2013. Bharadwaj noted that the film was a musical, revealing he had composed six songs of usual length plus fifteen more of about thirty seconds length for scenes. However the film ran into troubles in 2013 and filming was postponed for the remainder of the year. The team re-emerged and began production again in early January 2014, with Saran announcing that he had taken over the production and that new actresses Swasthika and Kesha Khambhati were also being introduced, in place of a couple of actresses who had been revealed earlier. In a press meet in August 2014, Saran announced that he had renamed two of the three female lead to avoid confusion with existing artistes. Hindi actress Sakshi Chaudhary became Samuthrika for Tamil films after impressing Saran at an audition, while Surabhi Santosh became Swasthika after Saran was impressed by a photograph. Supporting actress Rethika Srinivas, previously seen in Vazhakku Enn 18/9 (2012) and Nimirndhu Nil (2014), revealed that she would play a village character pitted against the two characters played by Vinay. She also revealed that the film's title had been changed to Aayirathil Iruvar and the team subsequently shot scenes in Tirunelveli. Besides Rethika, Sana and Kaajal Pasupathi were reported to play important roles. After three years of delays, the film was readied for release in September 2017 with the team heavily promoting Kaajal in the promotional posters, after she had gained fame through her appearance in Bigg Boss (2017).  Soundtrack  The film's music was composed by Bharadwaj, while the audio rights of the film was acquired by Junglee Music. The album released on 11 February 2015 with seven songs featuring lyrics by Vairamuthu and Kabilan Vairamuthu.  Release  The film's release was delayed for three years before makers readied the project for release in September 2017, following the publicity created by Vinay's appearance in Mysskin's crime thriller Thupparivaalan (2017). The film had a theatrical release on 22 September 2017 on the most crowded release date of the year at the Chennai box office, releasing alongside eight other films. Aayirathil Iruvar received negative reviews, with Sudhir Srinivasan of The New Indian Express writing it was an \\"all-round rotten drama\\" and adding \\"Aayirathil Iruvar is Tamil cinema's slap on every person who thinks film critics have an easy job”. A critic from Indiaglitz.com wrote \\"it is hard to believe that Saran has directed this mess\\" and that Vinay should \\"hope to forget this film in a hurry\\". Likewise, a reviewer from The Times of India wrote \\"to even attempt to describe the plot of Aayirathil Iruvar is enough to send one's head spinning, for writer-director Saran fills it with so many subplots that it is quite a wonder that the film makes some sense\\".

He has been elected MLA 4 times from Naggal constituency in his career and held the office of Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, PWD and Revenue at different times. He suffered a major set back in October, 1994 when he was implicated in a murder investigation. He resigned from his position as Minister of State for Revenue and was put behind bars for the next two and half years, without bail, pending trial. He contested the next election in 1996 from behind bars as an independent candidate and won with all the other contestants forfeiting their deposits. He was honorably acquitted of all charges in February, 1997. He re-joined Congress in 1999 under the presence of Sh. Ahmad Patel ji. He contested again from the same seat in 2000 and 2005 on Congress ticket. Elections of 2009 saw his old constituency dissolved under delimitation and he was given a new constituency, Ambala Cantt, to contest from. He lost the election despite of getting 43% of total polled votes in the new area. He was the first Haryana leader to raise the issue of discrimination in jobs, development and funding shown towards North-Haryana. To highlight this he held two mega-rallies in the historic grounds of Kurukshetra, Haryana. First one was ‘HISAAB LAGAO RALLY’ in year 2002 and was followed by a second mega rally as ‘HISAAB CHUKAO RALLY’ in year 2004, which saw massive participation from public and leadership alike from across Haryana. Fondly addressed as ‘Pradhan ji’, he presently holds the office of President of Distt. Congress Committee (Rural). Current he is serving as VICE PRESIDENT of Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee and Coordinator of Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee.  Vision for Politics  He is a grass root leader who has built his career on a solid foundation of committed relationships and impeccable conduct. A peoples man, he believes people should get the space and to voice their thoughts and exercise their rights whether its in organization or society. He has a reputation for being extremely approachable, very forthcoming and instant with the help he can offer and straightforward when he cannot do so. A man committed to his word, he has stayed away from ever promising falsely or leading people on with false assurances. In matters of state politics, he was the first man to put North Haryana on the political map of state by building and activating cadres in this region. He raised the matter of leaders being sent to this area from other parts of state to contest elections and thereby killing any local leadership which would have deeper and more solid roots in the area. He truly believes in leadership by the people and for the people in its truest sense. His method of functioning relies on local teams and booth committees being major partners in all decisions concerning development for any area.

When the National Roman Museum reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic Tinti worked with Abel Ferrara, who read his dramatic works inspired by the Ludovisi Gaul, a Roman marble group depicting a Gallic man in the act of plunging a sword into his breast . Writing  His work focuses on the subject of death and suffering and is mainly composed in the form of lucid and epigrammatic poetry. The humanity sung in his writings is the dramatic life of boxers, suicides, defeated heroes and the disabled. In 2016 he published Last words (Skira Rizzoli) a collection of found poetry in association with Andres Serrano.. His work has been inspired by the Greek lyric poets Archilochus and Theocritus, the Romantics Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats and the Russian poets Sergei Yesenin and Alexander Alexandrovich Blok. Controversy In an interview in The Washington Post, regarding his work with Kevin Spacey, he said that: “I have always taken the side of the scapegoat (…) I believe that Me Too movement is becoming a violent witch hunt. Spacey, like others, has the right to the presumption of innocence and I cannot in any way support the preventative exclusion and annihilation of a man, woman or work,” . His work with Abel Ferrara took place at a time when sculptures were being pulled down all over the world. After the performance Tinti said to la Repubblica: “Sculptures have a voice to be responded to or embodied, but through poetry, not violence”.

The film had its world premiere on September 11, 2012 at the Toronto International Film Festival and stars Francisco Barreiro and Laura Caro as a couple who finds that their children may have been exposed to something completely evil. Plot A serial killer attacks a lesbian couple. He kills one girl but is badly wounded by the other. He crawls dying up a large rocky hill and his body is never found. Years later, on an afternoon family outing at the same hill, adolescent siblings Adolfo (Alan Martinez) and Sara (Michele Garcia) enter a cave and do not return. Their parents, Felix (Francisco Barreiro) and Sol (Laura Caro), are distraught. A local gas station attendant says the hill is cursed and that night there is an unusual earthquake but the next morning the children are found by the police and the family is reunited. Returning home, the children start behaving strangely. Consultations with a doctor and a psychologist reveal the possibility of sexual abuse. Felix and Sol suspect Lucio, the local weirdo, assaulted Sara that afternoon on the hill. They confront and kill him, though later discoveries will convince Sol of his innocence. Police suspect the parents of the murder but never indict or arrest them. One night, abnormal events occur in the house: noises, flickering lights, slamming doors, and the children having unnatural seizures. Sol suspects something out of the ordinary, while Felix clings to mundane explanations and gets a gun for protection. Their differences lead Sol to do subsequent investigations independent of her husband and without always disclosing her motives or findings. Sol is told that Adolfo and Sara are skipping school and discovers that, dressed in their school uniforms, they are taking the bus back to the hill. She follows them up to the mouth of the cave where they disappeared but does not go in. The night of Lucio's killing, Sol's friend, Marcia (ignorant of the murderous plan), babysat the kids. The next morning Marcia was inexplicably gone and has been unreachable since. Sol now goes to see her and asks what happened that night. Marcia describes the children as being \\"lifeless,\\" says she was supernaturally assaulted by the devil, and witnessed Adolfo and Sara commit incest. Early in the morning, Sol returns to the hill and enters the cave where Adolfo and Sara disappeared. She finds their dead bodies, dressed as they were the afternoon they vanished. Staggering outside, she phones Felix who states definitively that he dropped the children off at school a mere fifteen minutes ago. Deeply shaken, Sol speaks to the gas station attendant who reveals that his daughter was the victim of the serial killer in the opening scene and that when the killer vanished on the hill there was an earthquake just like the night when Adolfo and Sara vanished. He says that \\"those who dwell there are in search of....people who can be possessed. To them, we're only a shell. They use us to do evil and then throw us away.\\" Sol lies to her family, telling them school is closed the next day but that she'll home stay with the kids and Felix should go to work as usual. At breakfast, she tranquilizes Adolfo and Sara, dresses them in formal clothes, and props them up at the kitchen table. She is then assaulted by an invisible force and sees dead versions of her children dressed in their cave clothes. Sol turns on the stove gas, drives away, and tells Felix to meet her at the gas station. Felix and Sol drive up the hill and go into the cave. When Felix sees the bodies of his children dressed as they were the day they disappeared, he shoots his wife then shoots himself. There is an earthquake. Versions of Felix and Sol return to their car and drive away haltingly, as if it were the driver's first time behind the wheel. Reception Critical reception for Here Comes the Devil has been mixed and the movie currently holds a rating of 41% on Rotten Tomatoes, based upon 22 reviews. Twitch Film gave the movie a positive review, commenting that several elements such as the \\"unusual, lurching changes that the movie goes through as it makes its way towards its finale\\" made the movie worth watching. Fangoria's Chris Alexander gave it four skulls, stating it was \\"one of the most interesting, frightening and thoroughly alive—both intellectually and viscerally—works of horror and dread this critic has seen in a very, very long time.\\" In contrast, a reviewer for RogerEbert.com gave the film one star and criticized it for its vagueness, stating that while the movie \\"hints at the possibility for a \\"Sixth Sense\\"-style plot twist\\" it wasn't \\"saying anything significant about anything\\" and was \\"just a bunch of stuff about demons, murder, female nudity and violent stabbings that, thankfully, will be exorcised from the memory almost as soon as the end credits finish rolling.\\" =Awards= *Best Actor at Austin Fantastic Fest (2012, won – Francisco Barreiro) *Best Actress at Austin Fantastic Fest (2012, won – Laura Caro) *Best Director at Austin Fantastic Fest (2012, won) *Best Picture at Austin Fantastic Fest (2012, won) *Best Screenplay at Austin Fantastic Fest (2012, won) *Best Feature Film at the Neuchâtel International Fantasy Film Festival (2013, nominated) *Best Foreign-Language Film at the Fangoria Chainsaw Awards (2014, nominated) *Best Actor at the Fangoria Chainsaw Awards (2014, nominated – Francisco Barreiro) ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:2012 films Category:2012 horror films Category:Uxoricide in fiction Category:Mexican horror films Category:Mexican films ","title":"Here Comes the Devil"},{"id":"41566438","text":"Gruffydd Vychan ap Iowerth Goch (c. 1150 - 1221) was a medieval British knight and Marcher lord.

Mark Johnstone sees in this work \\"a purity of line, form and shape, [that] are exercised with great clarity, and exemplify her long standing fascination with the materials of architecture.\\"“Strength Beyond Construction,” Catherine Wagner: 1976–1986, Tokyo: Gallery Min, 1986. In her departure from the tradition of landscape photography and an imbued interest in constructed, gritty, urban, and even architectural environments rather than natural or sublime environs, Wagner's early works relate to those of the New Topographers (several photographers participating in a 1975 show entitled New Topographics), rather than photographers of the American West such as Ansel Adams, Carleton Watkins, and Timothy H. O’Sullivan. Wagner has similarly dealt with built environments from the classroom to the theme park in projects including: Moscone Center (1978), American Classroom (1986), Home and Other Stories (1992), Disney’s Theme Parks: The Architecture of Reassurance (1995), and New Orleans World Exposition (1984–85). For Home and Other Stories, Wagner photographed the people's home interiors, cataloging individual domestic spaces—refrigerator shelves, bedrooms, foyers, and laundry rooms—without the homeowner in frame. Each home was presented as a photographic triptych. The images display evidence of the occupant's identity from the perspective of an outsider. The series was exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1993.  Mid- career  Art & Science: Investigating Matter examined both the laboratories in which scientific research takes place and the materials and instruments native to these environments, such as fruit flies, chemicals, beakers, test tubes, and flasks. The typology of twelve photographs of freezers, -86 Degree Freezer (12 Areas of Concern and Crisis), portrays the isolated subjects of critical scientific research in human health. The titles of the photographs, referencing specific case studies such as Bipolar Disorder, Alzheimer's, Breast Cancer, and HIV, contrast with the mundane visual nature of the subject matter: seemingly ordinary containers covered in frost stored in freezers. These photographs were used to create her first public art piece at Comme des Garçons in Kyoto, Japan. Art & Science: Investigating Matter was followed by a series of projects creating parallels between cultural and subjective frameworks of research and the humanities: Museum Pieces (1999), Cross Sections (2001), and Trilogy: Reflections on Frankenstein, the Arctic Circle, and the History of Science (2003). In these works, Wagner photographs the tools and materials used in museums and galleries in a manner that parallels the precision in the scientific study of objects. In 2001, Wagner further explored the impact of science on culture and notions of artistic accountability. Cross Sections employed the use of medical imaging devices such as the MRI and the scanning electron microscope to photograph familiar organic materials such as corncobs, pumpkins, and shark teeth. Wagner expanded upon this project to create an installation, Pomegranate Wall, consisting of ten 4 by 8 foot light boxes of duplicated MRI scans of pomegranates, and the permanent public art piece at the University of California, San Francisco, Cell Wall II. In A Narrative History of the Lightbulb, Wagner arranges her lightbulb subjects in a fabrication created for the sole purpose of photographing. This process \\"borrows from the rich history of the still life with a keen eye toward Giorgio Morandi, utilizing similar strategies of grouping familiar objects in beautiful, compelling installations.\\"\\"A Narrative History of the Lightbulb\\", Press Release, Stephen Wirtz Gallery. Lightbulbs are arranged by color in Ode to Yves and Green Energy; by technological advancement in Early Tungsten and Carbon Filaments 1900-1910; and by era in The Lamps of 1900 and The 1890s. In creating Re-classifying History, Wagner was given access to the storage facilities of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco, during the remodeling of the venue by Herzog & de Meuron.Sardar, Zahid. \\"Time Passages\\", SF Gate, 15 February 2004. Diverse organizational principles – sometimes playful – were utilized to alter the collection at random and without reverence for historicization or chronology, the common tools of museum classification. As an artist-in-residence at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, Wagner constructed massive photographic panels composed of the plants and insects that inhabited the San Francisco Bay Area 300 million years ago. Of this work, Hearne Pardee writes, \\"Wagner elevates sensory pleasure to an aesthetic plane by insisting on the work of nature in itself, setting the stage for an old-fashioned sense of wonder.\\"Pardee, Hearne. Catherine Wagner: \\"Morphology\\" at Steven Wirtz Gallery Art Ltd, March 2010.  Public art  Wagner’s public art began with a commission to create skins for the interior of Comme des Garçons in Kyoto, Japan. For this project, Wagner used her photographs from -86 Degree Freezers (12 Areas of Concern and Crisis) to clad the walls of the space from the showroom floor to the dressing rooms. Cell Wall II, depicting cells dividing, was created to line the courtyard of the University of California San Francisco’s Medical School. Swimmer’s Waves (2008), created for the Sava Pool in San Francisco and designed by Mark Cavagnero Associates, depicts light reflected and amplified by waves and wakes created by the movement of swimmers. For the new civic auditorium of the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, Wagner created Ghost Grove (2009). Along the interior walls of the auditorium, Wagner photographically etched anodized aluminum with images of an orange grove, which once covered all of downtown Los Angeles and the greater Southern California sprawl.Villarreal, Yvonne. \\"Artistic Visions for LAPD's New Headquarters\\", Los Angeles Times, 21 October 2009. Wagner is currently creating a public art piece for the Moscone Station of San Francisco’s new Central Subway. Her Moscone Center photographs of the 1970s and 1980s will be incorporated into the concourse and head house of the station. The photographs will be laser engraved onto massive grey granite panels, resting on the very site from which they were originally made.\\"Central Subway Public Art Program\\" , SFAC, 30 July 2010. David Johnstone writes of this work, \\"The images evoke a range of responses, from serene meditation to analytical observation, and mark the shifting artistic, political, social, and economic values represented by the construction on this piece of real estate.\\"“Strength Beyond Construction,” Catherine Wagner: 1976 – 1986, Tokyo: Gallery Min, 1986.  Awards, collections, and publications  Wagner has received many major awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, NEA Fellowships, an award from Artadia: The Fund for Art and Dialogue, the Ferguson Award, and a Fellowship from the San Jose Museum of Art. Wagner was also named one of Time Magazine’s Fine Arts Innovators of the Year in 2001. Her work is represented in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA); Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the Museum of Folkswang, Essen, Germany; and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Her monographs include Cross Sections (Twin Palms Press, 2002), Art & Science: Investigating Matter (Washington University, 1996), Home and Other Stories (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1993), and American Classroom (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 1988).

History The parish was founded in 1875, and was run by clergy of the Dominican Order until just after its 100th anniversary in 1975. Since that time the church has been run by members of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement. The present church building dates to 1882, and once contained a main sanctuary (still in use today), and a smaller sanctuary on the lower level of the church building. The \\"lower church\\" was largely unused since the late 1960s and was renovated into a community room in the mid 1980s. The church today serves as a regional base for the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement, hosting a number of retreats throughout the year, as well as being a parish for its immediate neighborhood. The Gratia Plena Evangelical Community is based at the church, and the former Monastery of St. Dominic is now home to members of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal. The former Monastery is now known as the Most Blessed Sacrament Friary. The parish provided clergy support to the nearby Monastery of St. Dominic until the monastery closed in the early 2000s.

The camp existed as a Labor Education Camp from July 1940 until the beginning of 1941, when it was converted into a Gypsy Detention Camp and used as such up to November of the same year. Today, a memorial place reminds of this prison.  History  The camp was situated in Weyer, a part of the municipality Haigermoos, which belonged to the municipality Sankt Pantaleon until 1945. = The Labor Education Camp = The Labor Education Camp existed from July 5, 1940 until about January 7, 1941. From July 7, 1940 until the end of August 1940, the inn Göschl in Moosach in the parish of Sankt Georgen bei Salzburg served as an edifice for the camp. Then, the Ortsgruppenleiter, the landlord and agriculturalist Michael Kaltenegger, as well as the Gaufürsorgeverband, the organization that officially ran the camp, provided the property of the landlord Geratsdorfer in Weyer as a sublease. Kaltenegger himself had leased it from the economically struggling landlord.Erinnerungsstätte Lager Weyer/Innviertel, brochure of the Society Memorial Site Camp Weyer, 2010. The prisoners were deployed in the regulation of the river Moosach.Andreas Maislinger: Ergänzung einer Ortschronik, in: Österreich in Geschichte und Literatur mit Geographie, May–June/July–August 1988, booklet 3/4, accessed December 24, 2010 In letters of the Gauleiter August Eigruber from May 31, 1940Society: Memorial Site Camp Weyer, accessed December 24, 2010 and of the Nazi appointee Kubinger from September 10, 1941 directed to all mayors of the district Oberdonau, the purpose of the camp is described as follows: :“Admitted can be such fellow citizens, that on principle refuse work, that skip work, that constantly cause disturbances at the work site, or that refuse any taking up of work at all, despite being physically fit. They all, however, have to have reached the age of 18. Also “anti-social” managing directors are included. Only cases of criminal nature cannot be covered in this setting. And serious cases of invalids, as hard physical labors have to be performed.” Corresponding to these guidelines, persons classified as “disagreeable” were consequently brought into the camp; So for example Karl Grumpelmaier from Mauthausen, the manager of a big woodworking business, because he refused to purchase a banner of the German Labor Front. The two teenage prisoners Oskar Heinrich and Heinrich Müller had refused to take part in the company- facilitated sports activities of the paper mill Steyrermühl and were – because they had not reached the age of 18 yet – unlawfully detained in Weyer as “anti-socials”. It is proven in many cases that not only “anti-socials” were admitted to the camp. Only upon their arrival at the camp the inmates were informed about the reasons of their arrest. There were no legal means; on their arrival, resorts of violence through the camp leader August Steininger were regularly the case. The so-called “education” became the responsibility of the camp personnel, which was composed of the SA-Standarte 159 from Braunau am Inn – whom also the camp commandant belonged to. With the continued existence of the camp, the violence of the SA became more and more prominent. The first person to die in the camp was Johann Gabauer from Julbach, who was left lying next to his fellow workers with fatal injuries. Numerous severely injured were admitted to the circumjacent hospitals. An extract from a medical history: :“Welts were discovered all over the body. E. temporarily regained conscience at the hospital and related that he had been thrown into the water repeatedly. He died on September 4th 1940. The chief doctor initiated a postmortem examination, in which superficial and bleeding damages of the epithelial layer were detected spread all over the back, especially on the protruding parts of the back, the back of the head and the upper arm. They apparently are the results of physical abuse.” After the death of Joseph Mayer, who came from Neukirchen, the camp physician Alois Staufer saw the opportunity to personally emerge from being involved – which he had become through issuing innocuous death certificates for camp victims. He presented the circumstances of the case to the local court Wildshut. A year-and-a-half- long struggle ensued concerning the arraignment against the superintendent and the camp management, but also against important Nazi figures such as Franz Kubinger and the district superintendent Stefan Schachermayer. The charges that were approved by the ministry of Justice in Berlin consisted of the following: * Manslaughter * Gross physical abuse * Confinement of individuals under the age of 18 * Confinement of individuals that couldn’t be declared as “reluctant to work” The Labor-Education-Camp Weyer was closed in the beginning of January 1941 in view of the impending lawsuit. Some of the prisoners were discharged in exchange for a vow of silence; others were transferred to concentration camps. The efforts of the Gauleitung for an abolishment of the lawsuit proved to be successful. The charge against a total of five defendants was dismissed on April 16, 1942, by authorization of Hitler himself. = The Gypsy Detention Center = From January 19, 1941, after the rushed closing of the Labor Education Camp, the district authorities detained more than 350 Austrian Sinti and Romanies in Weyer. The camp St. Pantaleon was now called “Gypsy Detention Camp”, similar to the camp Lackenbach in Burgenland, that had been established at about the same time. The camp staff was replaced, one gendarmerie leader and ten police reservists formed the supervisory staff, and an officer of the criminal investigation department Linz was appointed camp commander. The SA-Sturmführer Gottfried Hamberger remained administrator. The prisoners in St. Pantaleon were meant to continue with the drainage and regulation activities, however, more than half of the detainees were women and children. Whereas in the Labor Education Camp the camp physician reported death to the registrar, it was now the camp commander or administrator who assumed this duty. The mentioned cause of death is often exceedingly strange: “life-weakness” or “heart failure” with children, \\"Herzfleischentartung\\"cf. the novel eponymous novel of the author Ludwig Laher with an elderly lady. The dead bodies of the Sinti were – according to consistent testimonies of contemporary witnesses – for the time being deposited between shovels and pots in the gravedigger’s cell at the cemetery Haigermoos, and then buried during the night – without discernible gravesite. The camp was closed down on November 4, 1941, the inmates were loaded into cattle cars and – after a three-day stop over in Lackenbach, Burgenland – were brought, together with 4,700 other people, to the Gypsy Camp of the Ghetto Litzmannstadt in Łódź, Poland.Massendeportationen nach Lodz No one ever returned from there.  Repercussions  After the war, a People’s Court Lawsuit was initiated against the people in charge. However, it dragged on up until 1952 because of the flight of two of the main defendants. The lawsuits ended in convictions, the sentences ranged between 15 months and 15 years of prison. The lawsuit against the camp commander August Steininger ended in 1952 with two years and six months of imprisonment. The “Gypsy Detention Camp” was not even mentioned in the trials of the People’s Court after 1945. Even in the lawsuit against Gottfried Hamberger, also an administrator in the camp, the Camp II was not mentioned. And already in April 1955, all convicts were released on the occasion of the amnesty for the ten-year existence of the Second Republic. As from 1949, the Austrian political parties courted for the benevolence of former Nazis at national elections, and from 1950, they often were integrated into community politics. As in many other cases of the same subject matter, this period of history was suppressed or deliberately avoided. So, for example, in the chronicles of the municipality of St. Pantaleon, which were published in 1979 on the occasion of the anniversary of the “Innviertel by Austria”, and in which still only the soldiers killed in the war were mentioned. The memorial Only in the late 1980s, people started to concern themselves with the history of the camp. Ludwig Laher, an author living in St. Pantaleon, and Andreas Maislinger, a historian who was born in the neighboring parish Sankt Georgen bei Salzburg, initiated the erection of a memorial site. It was designed by the artist Dieter Schmidt coming from Fridolfing, Bavaria and inaugurated in 2000. The memorial site is maintained by the municipality St. Pantaleon and the society Memorial Site Camp Weyer. Through the memorial, the municipality Sankt Pantaleon commemorates also its own responsibility as the then competent administration.Der Gemeindevorsteher It is situated within the boundaries of today’s municipality Sankt Pantaleon, and not on the premises of the Weyer concentration camp, which belong to today’s municipality Haigermoos.

His name appears as the 27th listed in one of the oldest written records of Freemasons, the Mark Book of Aberdeen Lodge#1 (1670), as \\"Merchand and Meason\\".Bulloch, John. Henderson, John Alexander. Scottish Notes and Queries, Volumes 5-6. D. Wyllie & son, 1892. Records being vague of the membership to protect trade secrets, John Skene's name is the first that can be traced to the new world.Hodapp, Christopher. Solomon's Builders: Freemasons, Founding Fathers and the Secrets of Washington,, Part 3. Ulysses Press, Dec 21, 2006.

The passage for many of these Masons was secured by Harrie Elphingson (Master of Aberdeen Lodge #1 at the time of the Mark Book of 1670) as booking agent and under the patronage of the Earl of Perth, himself a Freemason.Mackey, Albert G. \\"Encyclopedia Of Freemasonry (Extended Annotated Edition)\\" Jazzybee Verlag, 2013 Skene moved to the Province of West Jersey in 1682.Jeffers, Harry Paul.

According to The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America (NSCDA), Skene purchased a 300 arce property in 1674 (though there is no evidence that he came to Jersey before 1682) that he named Peachfield. It was in the Second Tenth of the Province, an area that would become Northampton Township, Burlington County, New Jersey (Nov. 6th, 1688) and then Westampton Township, New Jersey (March 6, 1850) near Burlington, New Jersey. Skene served as Deputy Governor of West Jersey from 1684 until 1692.Lambert, David E. The Protestant International and the Huguenot Migration to Virginia. Peter Lang, 2010. =Freemasonry in the Early American Colonies= On June 5 of 1730, the Grand Master of England, Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk, appointed Daniel Coxe, Jr., of West Jersey as Provincial Grand Master of Freemasons for the provinces of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.Brownell, John. H.. Smith, Arthur Maurice. Morcombe, Joseph E.. Pride, Richard. Campbell, George T.. The American Tyler-keystone: Devoted to Freemasonry and Its Concerdant Others, Volume 16, Issue 14. J. H. Brownell, 1902. It has been said that he died before he had chartered a single lodge and that there is no evidence that Coxe ever did any Masonic work whatsoever while serving as Grand Master, but certain records indicate differently. His authority would have been brought to practical operation for the forming of a Lodge in Philadelphia, which the press of the day indicates existed in 1732 with William Allen as the Master. Also made a Mason during this period was Benjamin Franklin on February 1, 1731 at St. John's Lodge, which was itself founded in 1730 (perhaps St. John's Day, June 24).Whitehead, William Silas \\"Origin of Masonry in the State of New Jersey: And the Entire Proceedings of the Grand Lodge, from Its Organization.\\" J.

Leo \\"The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2: Printer and Publisher, 1730-1747\\" University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006 It is also indicated that it was not customary for Provincial Grand Masters abroad (away from England) to send any reports of their doings. Franklin later went on to form another Lodge in Philadelphia, seeking authority from Henry Price, the Grand Master of Masons for New England.

He is known in Icelandic folklore, where there are many folktales about his alleged magical abilities. He owned the farm Vogsósar, and was the vicar of Selvog church in the parish of Selvogur from 1677–1716. Some tales with him as the hero center on his magical duels with Stokkseyrar-Dísa. As a child he attended the Cathedral School at Skálholt to about 1658 and was ordained in 1668 by Bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson as curate of Arnarboeli.Legends of Icelandic Magicians by Jacqueline Simpson He became the parish priest of Vogsósar in 1667. Folklore and variations One folktale recounts how Eírikur rescued a woman who had been kidnapped by trolls.Legends of Icelandic Magicians by Jacqueline Simpson. He is also said to have exorcised the ghost of a woman named Guðrún or Gunna. In life she had owed a man named Vilhjálmur a debt but could not pay it as she was too poor. In consequence he took her cooking pot as payment. After she died Guðrún became a draugr and soon Vilhjálmur is also found dead. Eírikur exorcises the ghost by means of a slip of paper and a ball of wool with two knots in it which he gives to two men seeking his help. Gunna unties the knots and runs after the ball until she falls into a hot spring. Another story, which Jacqueline Simpson Legends of Icelandic Magicians, Jacqueline Simpson, D.S.Brewer Limited, 1975 calls \\"How Eírikur Learned His Arts At School,\\" takes place when Eírikur is at school in Skálholt. He and two of his friends, Bogi and Magnús, plan to learn magic. One night they journey to the cathedral graveyard and raise the ghost of an old man, obtaining the fragments of his magic book, and later compile the grimoire Gráskinna, making use of the many spells in the fragment. Years later he is summoned to Biskupstungar, where the Bishop of Skálholt shows him Gráskinna and asks him whether he knows any of the signs in it. He answers that he does not know a single one of the signs but later admits he knew all but one of them. In folklore, Eírikur is a kind, generous and compassionate man who only uses his powers for good.

It is the opening track of the band's ninth studio album, Journal for Plague Lovers. Produced by Steve Albini, the song, along with the other tracks of the album, features posthumous lyrics by Richey Edwards, who disappeared on 1 February 1995, and was declared legally dead in 2008. The song debuted on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 program on 25 March 2009. Background The lyrics of the song is taken from the notebooks and the artwork which Richey Edwards left to the band members just before his disappearance. The song also features an audio sample from the 2004 movie, The Machinist. In an interview with NME in 2009, the band's lead vocalist and lead guitarist James Dean Bradfield stated that the band's bassist Nicky Wire wrote the music to half of the song. In a subsequent interview, Wire stated that he wrote the chorus of the song. Critical reception The song generally received positive reviews. Lee White of This Is Fake DIY stated that \\"the song delivered with confidence and feels more considered than the onrush of fury and emotion that trademarked The Holy Bible.\\" Mike Diver of Clash argued that \\"the song is among the most aggressive pieces the Manics have penned since the days of ‘Faster’, the thundering drumbeats propelling it to juddering climax, while Wire’s bass work has rarely sounded so pant-wettingly threatening.\\" Dom Gourlay of Drowned in Sound also compared the song to the track \\"Faster\\", also describing songs' verses as \\"simply one of the most compelling vignettes the Manic Street Preachers have ever recorded.\\" David Smith of Popmatters praised Steve Albini's \\"refreshingly raw\\" production work on the song. Joe Tangari of Pitchfork stated that the song \\"opens the album with a colossal kick to the head as a queasy bassline is joined by pounding drums and sandpaper guitar to back Bradfield's righteous shout.\\" Sam Richards of Uncut stated that the song features \\"an oil-boring bass rumble, a searing post-punk guitar line and a slew of unmistakable Richey aphorisms.\\" He also described it as a pulsating opener, also inferring that \\"the band have recaptured that taut urgency, accommodating both their punk instincts and their stadium rock flourishes.\\" In his separate track review, Jonathan Garrett of Pitchfork wrote: \\"No question that \\"Apples\\" is firmly rooted in the past, splitting the difference between the near-pathologically hook-laden Generation Terrorists and the more deliberately caustic The Holy Bible, and there will undoubtedly be some who dismiss it solely on those grounds-- chalking up \\"Apples\\" as nothing more than an overly cynical, calculated attempt to cash in on the Edwards era from a band straining not to show its age.\\" Remix The song was remixed by English DJ and record producer Andrew Weatherall, who performed on the band's two London Astoria shows, which were Richey Edwards' final live appearances before his disappearance. The remix was included in the Journal For Plague Lovers Remixes EP, which was released on 15 June 2009.

Built in 1972, the centre has been the subject of numerous redevelopment projects undertaken by Salford City Council. The centre has 81 indoor shopping units and an indoor market complex which sells a wide range of goods. Outside the indoor structure is a KFC, post office and Aldi store, which opened in early 2014. Opposite the main site stands a large Tesco store which opened in November 2012 as part of a larger regeneration plan of the Pendleton area. History In 1952 the Ellor Street development plan was announced and was to be chaired by councillor Albert Jones. The plan proposed the demolition of 6,000 terraced houses over a 300-acre site in the Hanky Park (Hankinson Street) and Ellor Street areas of Pendleton. The area was to be cleared to make way for a new shopping centre designed to relieve 147 shops along the A6 road affected by road improvements and replace 120 corner shops set to be demolished under the development plan. In 1962 the project, which was to cost £5.25 million (£95 million in 2013 terms) began. The original proposal was to build a site which consisted of 260 shops, a market, spaces for 2,000 cars, plus a hotel, offices and flats. This prompted a local newspaper to run the story with the headline \\"It will be the finest in Europe.\\" Construction of the shopping centre and surrounding areas continued and on 21 May 1970 the new Salford Market officially opened. From 1971 onwards new shops inside the precinct itself began to open, the first of these being Tesco. However, due to a lack of funds and a political scandal which saw chairman Albert Jones jailed for eight months construction of Salford Precinct was halted. The site had only 95 shop units compared to the proposed 260, the hotel and two storey car park were never built. In 1991 the building was refurbished at a cost of £4 million, this included the installation of roofs across various walkways, making large swathes of the centre undercover. The shopping centre which at the time was known as \\"Salford Precinct\\" was renamed \\"Salford Shopping City.\\" On 9 August 1994 the Manchester Evening News reported that Salford City Council was planning on selling off Salford Shopping City to raise money for local housing repairs, these plans split the ruling Labour Party council, one councillor telling the press that it would be like \\"selling off the family silver.\\" In 2000 Salford Shopping City was eventually sold to a private company for £10 million in an effort to cut the council's deficit. It was then later sold in March 2010 to Praxis Holdings for £40 million, the company stated that it wanted to invest in the precinct and link it to the new food superstore. Salford riots 2011 Damage to Cash Converters after the Salford riots, 10 August 2011. On 9 August 2011 a minority of people from Salford and its surrounding Manchester areas attacked several retail outlets at Salford Shopping City,The Pendleton Riot, Bob Jeffery and Will Jackson, 2012 as part of the larger scale riots experienced in England that summer. Although shops on the inside of the centre remained largely untouched, outlets on Hankinson Way and Pendleton way were heavily damaged, one of the worst affected was Timpsons and Cash Converters, these outlets were both looted and set ablaze by rioters. Images of rioters breaking into several outlets on Hankinson Way including the Money Shop and Bargain Booze were broadcast on both local and national news programmes that day. Several reasons have been put forward for the events that took place at Salford Shopping City that day, they include poor relations with local authority and poor living conditions in the surrounding areas including Clarendon which at the time of the incident had the highest child poverty rates in Salford at 75%. However Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed these claims, stating that the rioters were merely \\"Opportunistic Thugs\\" in a statement to the House of Commons. Tesco controversy In October 2010 Salford City Council gave the go ahead for a new £45 million Tesco superstore to be built on Pendleton way opposite the site of Salford Shopping City. The plan involved the demolition of St James's R.C. Primary School which had stood on the site since the early 1900s, the demolition of Emmanuel Church which was to be later rebuilt on Langworthy Road and the permanent closure of Pendleton Way. The proposal was met with fierce opposition from both Salford Estates (owners of Salford Shopping City) who had purchased the site for £40 million in March 2010 and local residents. Gareth Edmunds of Salford Estates claimed that \\"traders can't compete with a Tesco of that size\\" and it would \\"destroy Salford Shopping City.\\" On 21 October 2010 Salford Estates launched judicial review proceedings against the Salford City Council over the sale of the land to Tesco and presented them with a petition with over 8,000 signatures from local traders and residents rejecting the proposal. Tesco are still breaching planning regulations by allowing deliveries after the curfew set down by Salford Councils planning department (2017) Despite this construction commenced in early 2012, the store was designed by Smith Smalley Architects and constructed by Patton Construction. The store opened on 15 November 2012. Tesco claimed the 24-hour store would create over 600 new jobs with at least half of them going to locally unemployed people. Future development Salford Estates have promised to continue to develop the site. In late 2012 the original market which had stood since 1970 was removed and replaced with 3 units. One of the units is a 15,900 sq ft supermarket to be occupied by Aldi opened in January 2014 and created over 80 jobs. Two further 5,000 sq ft non-food units have not yet been pre- let. In November 2013 a 2,661 sq ft KFC opened, creating 40 new jobs. Development will continue through 2014 and beyond, this will include over 90,000 sq ft of additional retail space split into two extensions of 13 double height shop units. Development will take place primarily on the west side of the complex including the removal of the current west side car park. As well as this there will be a new modern market hall and taxi rank constructed.

He saw his first drum and bugle corps, the United States Air Force Drum and Bugle Corps of Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. while in high school. After graduating high school in 1953, Crawford auditioned for the Air Force corps and was accepted as a baritone bugler.Truman W. Crawford, Colonel, United States Marine Corps He gained rapid promotion, becoming the unit's senior non-commissioned officer and musical director. As Glenn Miller had done with the Army Air Force Band during World War II, Crawford transformed the unit from a staid, martial music unit into a swinging, contemporary musical ensemble before the corps was disbanded in 1963.Col. Truman W. Crawford Leaving the Air Force after the drum corps' demise, Crawford moved to Chicago, where he went to work in a music store. He continued to write arrangements for drum corps, many of which he had begun his involvement with while in the Air Force. He worked especially closely with the Chicago Royal Airs Drum and Bugle Corps, which in 1965, playing Crawford's arrangements, became the only drum corps to win the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Catholic Youth Organization National Championships in the same season.Chicago Royal Airs By 1967, Crawford was credited with writing arrangements performed by a great majority of the senior and junior drum and bugle corps in the United States, Canada, and Europe.A History of Drum & Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; Drum Corps World, pub.; 2003 Colonel Truman Crawford conducting the USMC Drum and Bugle Corps. Due to his reputation and popularity in the drum corps world, in 1966, Crawford was asked to join the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps as chief musical arranger. Reentering the service as an enlisted man, he was later commissioned as a lieutenant and became commander of the drum corps. During his thirty-year career in the United States Marine Corps, Crawford rose to the rank of colonel and was decorated with the Legion of Merit, the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal among other honors. As he had done with the Air Force corps, Crawford made the Marine Corps corps into a smoothly swinging contemporary musical group.

He was the first of the Echlin Baronets of Clonagh, County Kildare. Early life He was born at Ardquin, County Down, the second son of Robert Echlin. The Echlin family had come to Ireland from Fife, Scotland, in the early seventeenth century. He was the great-grandson of Robert Echlin, who was Bishop of Down and Connor from 1612 to 1635. His mother was Mary Leslie, daughter of Henry Leslie, Bishop of Meath (died 1661) and his wife Jane Swinton.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 2 p.56 His father died when his children were still very young, and he seems to have left his family in some financial difficulty, although their position improved when his widow remarried Robert Ward of Killagh, County Down, who was a man of sufficient social standing to be created a baronet in 1682. His eldest brother John Echlin seems to have been a man of some substance: John's son Charles Echlin was an MP. Henry's younger brother was Lieutenant-General Robert Echlin (c.1657-c.1723), commander of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, and later a prominent Jacobite, who died in exile in France.D.W. Hayton ed. \\"Robert Echlin\\" in The History of Parliament -The House of Commons 1690-1715 (2002) He gained useful experience of the legal system by working in the courts as a clerk while still in his teens, no doubt to supplement his income, and at the same time attended the University of Dublin; he matriculated in 1667, was Scholar in 1668, and became Master of Arts in 1703. He practiced for some time as an attorney, then entered Lincoln's Inn in 1672 and the King's Inns in 1677.Ball p.56 King's Serjeant In 1683, he was appointed Third Serjeant-at-law.Hart, A.R. History of the King's Serjeant-at- law in Ireland Dublin Four Courts Press 2000 p.65 Since he was just over thirty and had only been in practice at the Irish Bar for six years, his appointment caused some surprise.Hart pp.65-6 Like most legal appointments at the time, it was largely due to the influence of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; Echlin also had the support of Sir John Temple, the Solicitor General for Ireland, who justified the appointment as follows: \\"He hath been seven or eight years at the Bar, and very studious and industrious in his profession, though I cannot say that either he or Mr SpriggA rival candidate, of whom little is known. are yet in any great practice.\\"Hart p.65 He was dismissed from his office of Serjeant in 1687, presumably as part of the campaign by King James II to appoint as many Roman Catholics as possible to senior legal offices.Hart p.66 Judge At the Glorious Revolution, he took his family to England to be out of harm's way, but he returned to Ireland in 1690 and was made second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland); he later transferred to the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), then returned to the Exchequer.Ball p.57 He regularly attended the Irish House of Lords to advise them on legal matters; he was knighted in 1692 and sat on a commission to assess the estates of those Jacobites who had fled to France. He was required to explain to the Lords why he had asked a bishop who had asked to give unsworn evidence in court to swear an oath (which is rather ironic given the number of bishops in his own family tree). He lobbied in 1706 to become Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, but was passed over, supposedly on the grounds of ill health, although he was well enough to go regularly on assize in Ulster. In 1713-4, Irish political life was greatly complicated by a feud between the central Government and Dublin Corporation. Echlin, along with his colleagues, signed a number of reports on the matter, which were considered to give a partisan view of the affair. Questioned years later by the Irish House of Commons on his actions, he admitted frankly that he knew little about the affair, but had signed whatever reports were placed before him for fear of losing his office if he refused.Ball p.57 Last years In 1714, on the death of Queen Anne, her Irish judges were removed en blocexcept Sir Gilbert Dolben, 1st Baronet and were in temporary disgrace (one, Anthony Upton, later committed suicide),Ball p.87- although the suicide may have been the result of a mental illness, and thus unrelated to his political disgrace but Echlin's reputation did not suffer permanently. Ball says that his loyalty to the House of Hanover was never seriously in question, although suspicions about his loyalty would have been natural enough from 1715 onwards, when his brother, General Robert Echlin, embittered by what he saw as the Crown's failure to reward him for his long and faithful service, fled to France and became a prominent Jacobite.Hayton History of Parliament (2002) The brothers do not seem to have been personally close, and there is no evidence that Henry, despite his increasing wealth, ever helped his brother financially. In 1721, Henry was made a baronet. He died in 1725.Mosley, ed. Burke's Peerage 107th edition Delaware 2003 Vol. 1 p.1268 Family He married Agnes, daughter of the Reverend William Mussen, and they had three sons and a daughter. Robert, the eldest son, died in 1706. He had married Penelope Eustace, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Maurice Eustace of Harristown, County Kildare, and the title passed on Henry's death to Robert's son, Sir Robert Echlin, 2nd Baronet.Burke's Peerage p.1268 The main Echlin estate was Kenure House at Rush, County Dublin, which had once belonged to the Duke of Ormonde: only a few traces of Kenure now remain. Echlin also owned Clonagh Castle in Kildare and a town house at Winetavern Street, Dublin.Ball p.57 Bibliophile There is a sympathetic account of his character, which notes in particular his abiding passion for books, from the author and bookseller John Dunton, who met him in 1698: \\"Baron Echlin is a person of great honour, and of a greatness of soul beyond most that I ever heard of. He is such a universal lover of books that very few if any shall escape him whatever their cost. He has a very large and curious library, yet is as inquisitive still after rarities as if he had none.\\"Ball p.28 References Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Ireland Category:1652 births Category:1725 deaths Category:People from County Down Category:Justices of the Irish King's Bench Category:Barons of the Irish Exchequer Category:Serjeants- at-law (Ireland) ","title":"Henry Echlin"},{"id":"41567174","text":"The 38th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade (38 AA Bde) was an air defence formation of Britain's Territorial Army formed just before World War II, which protected London and Southern England during the Blitz and later converted into an infantry formation for the liberation of Europe. Origins The brigade headquarters was formed on 28 September 1938 by duplicating the 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade at the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, London, as part of the expansion of Britain's Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences before World War II. The brigade was composed of searchlight units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE) and formed part of 1st AA Division, which came under Anti-Aircraft Command the following year.Frederick, pp. 1050–1.Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376. The first brigade commander was Brigadier W.T.O. Crewdson (appointed 28 September 1938).Monthly Army List.Farndale, Annex J. Mobilisation The deterioration in international relations during 1939 led to a partial mobilisation of the TA in June, after which a proportion of TA AA units manned their war stations under a rotation system known as 'Couverture'. Full mobilisation of AA Command came in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September 1939.Routledge, pp. 65–6. At this time the brigade had the following order of battle:AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. * 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Battalion (London Electrical Engineers), RE (TA) – from 26 AA Bde ** HQ, 303, 321 and 339 AA Companies at Duke of York's HQ, Chelsea ** 301 Company at Shepherd's Bush * 27th (London) Anti-Aircraft Battalion (London Electrical Engineers), RE (TA) – from 26 AA Bde ** HQ at Streatham ** 304, 305, 306 and 390 AA Companies at Westminster * 75th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment, RA (TA) – formed May 193975 SL Rgt at RA 39–45 Litchfield, p. 180. ** HQ and three S/L Batteries at Cowley, London * 38th AA Brigade Company, Royal Army Service Corps Blitz 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth In August 1940, the Royal Engineers AA battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery and were termed Searchlight Regiments. By now, the 27th (London Electrical Engineers) had been transferred to 47 AA Bde covering Southampton,27 S/L Rgt at RA 39–45 and had been exchanged with 35th (1st Surrey Rifles) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery.35 S/L Rgt at RA 39–45 Litchfield, p. 173.1st Surrey Rifles at Regiments.orgFarndale, Annex D, p. 257.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. In October, 38 AA Bde was joined by the newly raised 79th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery.79 S/L Rgt at RA 39–45 During the Blitz of 1940–41, 38 Light AA Bde provided the searchlight component of 1 AA Division, directing the Heavy (HAA) and Light (LAA) anti- aircraft guns defending London.1 AA Division at RA 39–45 1st AA Division had established a control centre at the disused Brompton Road tube station, with an elaborate network of dedicated telephone lines linking the AA sites across the Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ), including many isolated searchlight positions.Routledge,p. 65.Routledge, pp. 388–9. The London IAZ extended from Cheshunt and Dagenham in the east to Bexley and Mitcham in the south and to Richmond and Northolt in the west, with three brigades of guns deployed. Superimposed across the IAZ were the 73 searchlight sites controlled by 38th AA Bde. In the absence of inland radar coverage, 1st AA Division's Chief Signals Officer, Lt-Col G.C. Wickens, devised a system of 14 fixed base-lines of sound locators to detect night raids approaching the IAZ. These were linked by automatic telephone equipment to the Brompton operations room, where the angular plots were resolved to indicate grid squares where the HAA guns in range could fire an unseen barrage. Detachments of 75th Searchlight Regiment from 38th AA Bde were trained to operate the base lines. This 'Fixed Azimuth' system came into action in June 1940, in time for the opening of the night Blitz on London. It was later replaced as searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced. However, the performance of the AA defences in the early weeks of the Blitz was poor. AA Command moved 108 HAA guns to the IAZ from other divisions, and arranged 'fighter nights' when the guns remained silent and Royal Air Force (RAF) night fighters were allowed to operate over London with the searchlights. Gun-laying (GL) radar, modern sound-locators and larger (150 cm) searchlights were introduced as rapidly as possible, and by February 1941 Searchlight Control (SLC or 'Elsie') radar began to be issued, replacing the fixed azimuth system. The number of raiders shot down steadily increased until mid-May 1941, when the Luftwaffe scaled down its attacks.Routledge, pp. 389–91.Collier, Chapter XVI.Collier, Chapter XVII.Pile's despatch. =Order of Battle 1940–41= 150 cm Searchlight equipped with SLC radar. The composition of 38 LAA Bde during this period was as follows: Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. * 26th (LEE) S/L Rgt ** 301, 302 S/L Btys – attached to 8 AA Division until Summer 1941 ** 321, 339 S/L Btys * 35th (First Surrey Rifles) S/L Rgt – to 5 AA Division Summer 1941 ** 340, 341, 343 S/L Btys ** 342 S/L Bty (attached to 5 AA Div) * 75th (Middlesex) S/L Rgt – converted into 75th LAA Rgt February 1941Farndale, Annex M. and joined 8 AA Division * 79th S/L Rgt ** 502, 503, 504 S/L Btys Mid-War The Blitz ended in May 1941, but there were occasional raids thereafter and AA Command continued to strengthen its defences. Newly formed units joining AA Command were increasingly 'mixed' ones into which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated. AA Command had a critical shortage of Light AA gun (LAA) units, and began a process of converting some S/L units to the role. At the same time, experienced units were posted away for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for Operation Torch.Routledge, pp. 399–404. The AA defences of Southern England were severely tested in the summer of 1942 by the Luftwaffe's 'hit-and-run' attacks along the South Coast, and there was much reorganisation, accounting for some of the turnover of units listed earlier. LAA units waiting to go overseas were sometimes lent back to AA Command to deal with the hit-and-run raiders.Collier, Chapter XX. =Order of Battle 1941–42= 1 AA Divisional formation sign, worn 1940–42.

In January 1943 the brigade came under the command of 2 AA Group covering South East England outside London.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.Routledge, Map 36. =Order of Battle 1942–44= AA Command formation sign worn 1942–44.

At the end of April 1944, 38 AA Bde consisted solely of 183rd (M) HAA Rgt and 22 AA Area Mixed Rgt (as 'Z' regiments were now termed). However, AA Command now brought in additional units from other parts of the UK to defend the Overlord embarkation ports. 47 AA Brigade in the Southampton area of 2 AA Group was disbanded and 38 AA Bde took over much of its responsibilities, once again taking control of a number of S/L units across South East England.Routledge, p. 409. Shortly after D-Day, the Germans began launching V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', against London. These presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz. Defences had been planned against this new form of attack (Operation Diver), but it presented a severe problem for AA guns, and after two weeks' experience AA Command carried out a major reorganisation. In August, 38 AA Bde was transferred to the command of 6 AA Group, which had earlier been brought from Scotland to defend the Overlord build-up in the Portsmouth–Solent area. It returned to 2 AA Group in December.Routledge, pp. 411–15. =Order of Battle 1944= During the rest of 1944, 38 AA Brigade's composition was as follows: * 179th (M) HAA Rgt – from 4 AA Group May 1944; to 3 AA Group November 1944 ** 584, 606, 607 (M) HAA Btys * 183rd (M) HAA Rgt – to 102 AA Bde May 1944 ** 564, 591, 608, 640 (M) HAA Btys * 88th LAA Rgt – from 4 AA Group May 1944; to 102 AA Bde July 1944 ** 178, 289, 293 LAA Btys * 147th LAA Rgt – from unbrigaded December 1944; left January 1945 ** 492, 493, 495 LAA Btys * 28th (Essex) S/L Rgt – from 47 AA Bde June 1944 ** 309/311, 312, 438 S/L Btys * 38th (King's Rgt) S/L Rgt – from 27 (Home Counties) AA Bde May, returned June 1944 ** 350, 351, 352 S/L Btys * 50th (Northamptonshire Rgt) SL Rgt – from 47 AA Bde June 1944 ** 401, 402, 403 S/L Btys * 61st (South Lancashire Rgt) S/L Rgt – from 27 (Home Counties) AA Bde May, returned June 1944 ** 432, 433, 434 S/L Btys * 93rd (M) S/L Rgt – returned from 47 AA Bde June 1944; to 1 AA Group January 1945 ** 301, 342, 495 S/L Btys * 22nd AA Area Mixed Regiment – joined April 1944; left January 1945 ** 194, 198 (M) Z Btys By October 1944, the brigade's HQ establishment was 10 officers, 8 male other ranks and 25 members of the ATS, together with a small number of attached drivers, cooks and mess orderlies (male and female). In addition, the brigade had a Mixed Signal Office Section of 5 male other ranks and 19 ATS, which was formally part of the Group signal unit.AA Command Organisation Table, October–November 1944, TNA file WO 212/148. Conversion By the end of 1944, 21st Army Group was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141–2. At the same time the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted. In January 1945 the War Office began to reorganise surplus AA and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Infantry Regiments RA at RA 39–45 Routledge, p. 421. A number of AA Brigade HQs in 2 AA Group were also converted: on 22 January 1945, HQ 38 AA Bde was converted into 304th Infantry Brigade under Brigadier C.A.H. Chadwick with the following units under command:Joslen, p. 400.304 Infantry Brigade at RA 39–45 * 630th (Essex) Infantry Regiment, RA, formed by 28th (Essex) S/L Rgt (see above)630 Infantry Rgt at RA 39–45 28 SL Rgt at RA 39–45 * 637th (Northamptonshire Regiment) Infantry Regiment, RA, formed by 50th (Northamptonshire Regiment) S/L Rgt (see above)637 Infantry Rgt at RA 39–45 50 SL Rgt at RA 39–45 Northamptonshire Volunteers at Regiments.org * 638th (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Infantry Regiment, RA, formed by 53rd (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery.638 Infantry Rgt at RA 39–45 53 SL Rgt at RA 39–45 BBC – WW2 People's War After infantry training, the brigade went to Norway in June 1945 to help oversee the surrender of the German occupying forces there.

MacBain was the youngest son of Smith MacBain, of Invergordon, Ross-shire, Scotland, and was born at Kinrhive in that county in 1828. He served a business apprenticeship in Inverness. In 1853 he married Jessie Smith, youngest daughter of William Smith, of Forres, and sister of the late Duncan Smith, manager of the Oriental Bank Corporation at Bombay. Immediately afterwards MacBain came to Melbourne, where he entered the service of the Bank of New South Wales. He quit shortly after and became partner in Melbourne of the mercantile and squatting agency firm of Gibbs, Ronald & Co. In 1863 he became a partner in the Geelong and London business of that firm, and of Richard Gibbs & Co., of London. In 1865 Geelong and London was sold to the Australian Mortgage, Land and Finance Company, Limited, of the Australian Board of which Sir James was chairman. Sir James was a member of the Council, and a trustee of both the Ormond College, affiliated to Melbourne University, and of the Working Men's College, Melbourne. He was also a trustee of the Scotch College and the Ladies' Presbyterian College, and of the Public Library and National Gallery in that city. Sir James represented the Wimmera district in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1864 to 1880, and in 1880 was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for the Central province. He was a member of the Bryan O'Loghlen Government without portfolio from August 1881 to March 1883, in which year he visited Europe and acted as chairman of the Victorian Commission at the Amsterdam Exhibition. In the next year MacBain was elected for the South Yarra Province, and succeeded Sir William Henry Fancourt Mitchell as President of the Victorian Legislative Council, from 27 November 1884 to 8 November 1892. He was knighted in May 1886, and having in the meantime acted as president or the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, was created K.C.M.G. in 1889. MacBain died in Toorak, Melbourne on 4 November 1892.

Legal troubles In 2013, Shooter was charged by the Yuma city prosecutor with three misdemeanor counts (criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, and interference or disruption of an educational institution). The charges related to an incident in which Shooter charged into a charter school classroom and confronted a special education teacher about his grandson. Upon payment of $1,000 in restitution to the school and a $1,500 fee to the city, Shooter's prosecution was deferred on condition that he not violate any criminal law during the following year. Shooter denied knowledge of specifics, claiming he “didn't read all the details” of the agreement. In 2013 Shooter filed a campaign finance report claiming $20,000 for fuel and mileage costs. In 2014 he filed an amended report to cut that amount in half. Sexual harassment claims and expulsion from the state House In November 2017, multiple women came forward to accuse Shooter of sexual harassment. Representative Michelle Ugenti-Rita recalled an instance when he came to her office and asked her about her chest. She also did not open the door when he invited himself to her hotel room with a six-pack of beer. State Representatives Wenona Benally and Athena Salman have also made public allegations against him. On November 7, Mi-Ai Parrish, publisher of the Arizona Republic, described sexual and racial comments made to her by Shooter. As of November 14, 2017, nine women have accused Shooter of sexual harassment. On February 1, 2018, the Arizona House of Representatives voted 56–3 to expel Rep. Shooter. The House approved a resolution stating that \\"the House of Representatives finds that Representative Don Shooter's pattern of conduct was dishonorable and unbecoming of a member.\\" This was the first occasion since 1991 that a member had been expelled from the Arizona Legislature.

These records are kept in a humidity and temperature controlled environment and any necessary preservation measures are conducted in the Archives' conservation laboratory. The Hall of Records, predecessor of the Maryland State Archives, was created as an independent agency in 1935, charged with the collection, custody, and preservation of the official records, documents, and publications of the state (Chapter 18, Acts of 1935). Impetus for its development can be traced to the state's tercentenary celebrations of 1934. The Maryland Tercentenary Commission made a modern, centralized archives a key feature of the commemoration of the state's 300th anniversary. A \\"Memorial Hall of Records\\" was proposed as early as 1928, and in 1931, the General Assembly appropriated funds to erect an archives building which was opened to the public in 1935. A Hall of Records Commission was also created in 1935 to serve as management for the Archives; it took on an advisory role in 1984. The Hall of Records was incorporated into the Maryland Department of General Services in 1970 (Chapter 97, Acts of 1970).

Education She was born into a farming family living at Llanrhidian on the Gower Peninsula. At 18 she won a scholarship to University College Swansea where she graduated in 1925 with a first class honours degree in geology. She then went on to study with Arthur Trueman at Swansea, with whom she worked for the next five years on various projects. T. Neville George worked with her on the Coal Measures. She was awarded an M. Sc. in 1926 for work on paleontology in the Coal Measures of the Gwendraeth Valley in South Wales and a DSc.doctorate from the University of Wales in 1933 for a thesis about correlation of coal seams in South Wales. Her research was supported by grants from the government because of its importance to the coal industry. Academic career In 1929 Dix was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society. In 1930 she was appointed lecturer in geology at Bedford College in London, where she stayed for the rest of her working life. Her initial work, following that of Truman, was on non-marine bivalves in the South Wales Coalfield. This remained an interest throughout her working life. Dix's major contribution was to apply Trueman's approach to biostratigraphy to plant fossils. She presented her work at international conferences including the Second International Carboniferous Congress in Heerlen (the Netherlands) in 1935. In 1936 she was awarded the Murchison Fund by the Geological Society of London for her work on palaeontology and stratigraphy in the Coal Measures that combined flora and faunal evidence, thus improving information about the Upper Carboniferous successions. This information was useful to the coal industry as well as fundamental science. World War II came at the height of her career, and disrupted her scientific activities. Along with the rest of Bedford College, she was evacuated to Cambridge, leaving behind her collections of fossils and scientific reprints which were later lost through bombing. Dix's wartime papers were mainly on relatively minor aspects of coal geology (e.g. the presence of boulders in coal seams) and plant biostratigraphy is rarely mentioned. Bedford College returned to London in 1944 and Dix led a field trip of the Geologists' Association to Guildford in June 1945. Personal life Towards the end of the war, Dix suffered a mental breakdown which caused the end of her scientific career. By 1946, her condition had so deteriorated that her sister Margaret had taken over her affairs, and moved Dix to The Retreat mental hospital in York, where she had new experimental surgery called prefrontal leucotomy which was unsuccessful and ruined her ability to ever recover. Her contract with the Bedford College formally expired on 31 December 1947. She was then transferred to St David's Hospital Carmarthen where she remained until her death. Legacy Most of her fossils survived and her collection is now divided between the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, and the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge. Selected publications She published 40 articles and notes. They included: * Dix, E. (1934) The sequence of floras in the Upper Carboniferous with special reference to South Wales.

Since then he has insisted on mixing art, essay and fiction in his publications. As he has stated: \\"First of all, I'm a writer. I started to draw late, at age 21, when I had just finished studying in New York and visited museums and galleries. I went to live in Paris and without any training I requested admissions to a school of fine arts.\\"Enrique Planas. \\"Eduardo Lalo: Estaba leyendo en mi cama y luego me llamó todo el mundo\\", El Comercio, 29.06.2013; accessed 07.07.2013. His international recognition came in 2013, when he won the Rómulo Gallegos Prize for his novel Simone, an English-language translation of which was published in 2015 by the University of Chicago Press. Also in 2013, he led the Puerto Rican delegation to the XVIII International Book Fair in Lima, where Puerto Rico was the guest of honor.Ernesto Carlín. \\"Eduardo Lalo inaugurará la Feria del Libro de Lima\\" , El Peruano, 14.06.2013; accessed 07.07.2013.

She co-founded the USC Center for Law and Philosophy, and directs the USC Levan Institute’s Conversations in Practical Ethics Program. Lloyd’s work, especially on the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, has been considered some of the most significant work published in recent years. Education and career Lloyd graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1981 where she studied with Philippa Foot and Rogers Albritton, and earned her PhD in philosophy from Harvard University in 1987, where she wrote her dissertation under John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon. She has taught at the University of Southern California since 1987. She has served as co-editor for Pacific Philosophical Quarterly and as Review Editor for Philosophy & Public Affairs. Philosophical work Lloyd specializes in the history of moral and political philosophy, contemporary political philosophy, and feminist philosophy. One of the preeminent Hobbes scholars, Lloyd has authored two books on Hobbes--Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes: Cases in the Law of Nature and Ideals as Interests in Hobbes's Leviathan: The Power of Mind over Matter--and edited two others. She has also written many peer-reviewed papers, as well as many articles, commentaries, and presentations on topics ranging from Hobbes and the application of Hobbesian ideas, to the philosophies of Machiavelli and John Stuart Mill, to contemporary liberalism and liberal feminist philosophy. Her first book, Ideals as Interests in Hobbes's Leviathan: The Power of Mind over Matter, defends the controversial thesis that Hobbes was concerned with transcendent interests – interests that override the fear of death – not, as it is usually assumed, with the desire for self-preservation. Lloyd's second book, Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes: Cases in the Law of Nature, was described by A.P. Martinich, writing in the Journal of the History of Philosophy, as one of the most significant books about Hobbes published in the last twenty five years.

Born into a working class family in Portsmouth shortly before the end of World War II, Davis grew up in the Yorkshire fishing village of Withernsea during the 1950s, where an experimental school made it possible for Davis to become the first member of his family to attend university. Shortly before graduating from Cambridge University, Davis was left heartbroken by the suicide of his schizophrenic brother and decided to begin living and teaching abroad. In 1970, Davis fell in love with an Iranian woman, Afkham Darbandi, and decided to live permanently in Iran during the reign of the last Shah. As a result, he taught English at the University of Tehran, and married Afkham Darbandi, about whom he has since written and published many love poems, in 1974. After the Islamic Revolution turned Dick and Afkham Davis into refugees, first in the United Kingdom and then in the United States, Davis decided to begin translating many of the greatest masterpieces of both ancient and modern Persian poetry into English. Davis is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and has been called, by The Times Literary Supplement, “our finest translator from Persian.\\" Davis' original poetry has been just as highly praised. Davis' poetry collections have been chosen as books of the year by The Sunday Times (UK) in 1989; The Daily Telegraph (UK) in 1989; The Economist (UK) in 2002; The Washington Post in 2010, and The Times Literary Supplement (UK) in 2013. Early life Davis was born at Portsmouth, England in 1945, but was grew up in Withernsea, Yorkshire. He never knew his biological father, who left when Davis was two years old. His mother remarried soon afterwards and, even though his mother and stepfather were working class people with very little education, they both read voraciously. Davis later recalled, \\"...there were many books around the house, and I was expected to read them like everyone else.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 251-253. He later recalled, \\"Portsmouth is a big naval town with a large sailor population. It's a noisy, busy, and dirty place. Our Yorkshire home was in a small village by the sea. In the past, it had been primarily a fishing village, but that was winding down when I was a child, although the boats still went out in the morning to fish in the North Sea. But mainly the village was dependent on summer tourism. Yet I can still remember that whenever there were storms at sea, there was a particular hymn we always sang in school because the fathers of some of the boys still went out in their fishing boats. The hymn was O, Hear Us When We Cry to Thee, For Those in Peril on the Sea, and, to this day, I still can't hear that hymn without a lump in my throat.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 251-252. Davis has said that he was very influenced by his stepfather, who had a passionate love of reading about world history. He added, \\"My stepfather, in many ways, is a very noble man, and he always was. He served in the Second World War and he was highly decorated for bravery. He never talked about it, but I'm certain he killed people in combat and felt quite terrible about it. When I was a very young boy, I remember him bringing a German guest into the home. In those days, it was a terrible thing to do in a little village. Naturally, the Germans had a terrible reputation in England during the 1950s. But he didn't care. He wanted to show his hospitality. A few years later, when I was about eight or nine, we had a West Indian staying in our house, and he was the first black person to ever appear in the village. My stepfather had befriended the young man in London, and he'd always had this belief that nation's shouldn't be isolated from each other.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 261-262. Davis further recalls, \\"I was lucky because they decided to set up an experimental school, which they called a comprehensive school, which is quite similar to public schools in the U.S. Previously in England, when you went to a state school, you were divided into two groups at the age of eleven: those who went to grammar school and those who didn't. But, back then, they were considering allowing everyone to go to the same school, and our little rural community was chosen as a pilot area. Since this was unique and experimental at the time,it attracted some very dedicated and excellent teachers who moved to Withernsea. So even though I lived in a very small and isolated village, I had some extremely good teachers, and because of them I was able to go to Cambridge. I came from a family where nobody had ever been to University, let alone Cambridge, and I believe that if I'd gone to a regular state school and didn't have all those dedicated teachers, I probably wouldn't have made it.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 252. Davis has credited the English master at the Withernsea school, John Gibson, with instilling in him a love of poetry. Davis adds that that by the time he, \\"went up to Cambridge,\\" he had, \\"pretty well read the entire canon of English poetry.\\" Gibson once urged Davis to read John Milton's Paradise Lost over summer break. Another summer, Davis was urged to read William Wordsworth's The Prelude.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 253. Davis has also said, \\"As an adolescent, one of my favorite books was Fitzgerald's Rubaiyat, which, as you know, is a very romanticized version of Iran. Fitzgerald had himself never visited Iran and, as a matter of fact, he never got as further east than Paris. So his translation presents a kind of imaginative vision of Iran, one which I found very attractive.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 257. Davis has said that his favorite poets during school were William Blake, D.H. Lawrence, and American poet Emily Dickinson. He commented, \\"Somehow I discovered Dickinson, which was strange back then because American poetry was never taught in English schools. But somehow I got ahold of her poems, and I loved them and imitated them. I loved the epigrammatic aspect of her work - poems that were short, sharp, and to the point, and I thought to myself: 'That's the kind of poetry I want to write.'\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 254. Cambridge Davis attended King's College, Cambridge,William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 254-255. where he was introduced to Persian and Indian literature through his friendship with E.M. Forster and to San Francisco LGBT poet Thom Gunn. When asked if he had ever attempted to write free verse, Davis replied, \\"I tried it for a very short time, less than a year, when I was about eighteen. Back then, it seemed to be what people were doing, and what you were supposed to do. But I very quickly realized that I wasn't interested in writing free verse. I think it was Raymond Chandler who once said you should write the kind of novels that you'd like to read, and I'd never particularly enjoyed reading free verse. I read it dutifully, of course. I read Gunn's free verse because I admired Gunn so much, and I read a lot of the American free verse poets, but I never wanted to do it myself.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 255. Davis also recalled, however, \\"My brother committed suicide when he was nineteen and I was twenty-one. We had the kind of relationship that brothers often have; we were very close, but we also had a strong rivalry. He was a very unhappy child, and he was diagnosed as being mentally unstable - as a schizophrenic - and he spent a lot of his adolescence in and out of institutions... my years at Cambridge were shadowed by my brother since he was often ill. He also had very bad relations with my parents, and they'd effectively turned over his care to me. So I spent a lot of time seeing him into institutions, although he would often run away. It was a very strange experience for both of us and I took his death very hard. For a long time, I couldn't deal with it and, to be honest, it's the reason that I left England. He died shortly before I graduated from Cambridge, and as soon as I graduated, I said, 'I have to get away from here.'\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 260. Inside the Shah's Iran According to Davis, \\"I left Cambridge in my early twenties, and I taught first in Greece and then in Italy, but I was feeling the urge to go somewhere outside of Europe, and a friend of mine who'd been working as an archaeologist in Iran said it was a wonderful country and that he was planning to teach there for a while. So he said, 'Why don't you come, too? We can share an apartment.' So that's what I did. I got a job teaching English at Tehran University on a two year contract. During that time, I fell in love with the woman I'd eventually marry, so when the two year contract ended, I looked for another job so I could stay in Iran and be near her and get married.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 255-256. Of his relationship with his wife Afkham Darbandi Davis has said, \\"There were, of course problems because her parents were very much against it. It was the usual concerns, marrying a foreigner, we don't know who he is and all of that. So I stayed in Iran for two more years, and we were married in 1974.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 256. After their wedding in Tehran, the Davises had their honeymoon in Cochin, India, which Davis has since memorialized in the love poem, Memories of Cochin.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 267. When asked about the many other love poems addressed to his wife, Davis replied, \\"It's often occurred to me that there are so few poems that celebrate love within a marriage. It's been suggested that Petrarch would never have written all his sonnets to Laura if he'd slept with her. But marriage exists all over the world, and it's very real for many people. It's not some fantasy or illusion, and it's something I've always wanted to write about. As for my children, they're immensely important to me. You certainly don't want to burden them with your emotions; but, on the other hand, the emotions are still there, and I've tried to write about it. I must admit that I find those poems very hard to write, much more difficult than writing poems about my wife.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 266. When asked whether he and Afkham were ever at risk during the Islamic Revolution and the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty, Davis said, \\"There was certainly danger out there, of course, but I never felt specifically in danger because I was a Westerner. In fact, my students would often try to protect me, saying, 'There's going to be a big demonstration downtown, and it's going to be at such-and-such a time and such-and-such a place, so don't go down there. Or, if I wanted to go out of curiosity, they'd say, 'If you really need to go,then we'll go along and make sure you're okay.' The people who experienced the real hostility in Tehran were the people associated with Western Governments. As for the rest of us, Iranians would often say things like, 'Tell people in your country what's happening here. The world should know.' So I personally never had any problems, but my wife and I did have an apartment on a main road where there were many demonstrations, and sometimes there was shooting going on. We lived on the third floor, with large plate-glass windows, and we could look out and see the tanks outside, and that didn't feel too good. At the time, we had a couple of friends who were Indians who lived on a back street, and they said, 'Why don't you come and stay with us until all this quiets down?' So we moved in with them for about three weeks, but it soon became clear that it wasn't going to quiet down in the foreseeable future, so we made arrangements to leave the country.\\" The Davises left Iran for the United Kingdom in November 1978. Life as refugees After arrived in the United Kingdom, Davis made a translation with Afkham's assistance of Attar of Nishapur's The Conference of Birds, which was published in 1984. Since then, Davis has published literary translations of a collection of medieval Persian epigrams in 1997, Ferdowsi's The Shahnameh, Iran's national epic, in 2006, and Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani's famous love story Vis and Ramin in 2009.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 231-275. In 2012, Davis published Faces of Love: Hafez and the Poets of Shiraz. The book is a collection of verse by the poets of Medieval Shiraz, which was so secular compared to other cities in the Islamic World that Davis compares it with Venice. The collection includes many poetic laments written after the Royal House of Inju was overthrown in 1353 by Mubariz al-Din Muhammad, an Islamic Fundamentalist, who imposed Sharia Law upon Shiraz, closed the wine shops, and forced the women of the city to wear the chador and be confined indoors unless escorted by a male relative. According to Davis, Mubariz was sarcastically dubbed \\"The Morals Officer,\\" by the poets and people of Shiraz, who were overjoyed when Mubariz was ultimately overthrown and blinded by his son, Shah Shoja Mozaffari, who reversed his father's Islamic fundamentalist policies. The three poets Davis translated for the collection are Hafez, \\"who's without question, the most famous lyric poet in Iranian history,\\" Princess Jahan Malek Khatun, who, \\"is the only Medieval woman poet whose complete works have come down to us - well over a thousand poems,\\" and Ubayd Zakani, \\"the most famous obscene poet from Medieval Iran.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 273-274. Most recently, in 2015, Davis published a book of translated poems by Fatemeh Shams, an award-winning Iranian female poet and vocal critic of the Shia clergy who are the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Shams, like the Davises, is currently living in exile in the United States.Fatemeh Shams translations by Dick Davis. While interviewing Davis, William Baer mentioned the, \\"powerful spiritual resonance,\\" in the former's poetry, as well as several of his poems, such as Maximilian Kolbe, Rembrandt's Return of the Prodigal Son, A Christmas Poem, and others, could be considered works of Christian poetry.William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 263. Davis replied, \\"Spirituality has always been very difficult for me, and I think I'm an Atheist. On the other hand, I'm very sympathetic to religious emotion. If I'd lived in the Middle Ages, I probably would have been a monk. I would have been a very bad monk because I would have been tormented by lots of non-monkish desires. But I'm very drawn to spirituality, and I'm very drawn to those people who live a truly spiritual life. Having said that, I'm often very revolted by the way in which most religions are actually practiced in the world. I've lived in the Middle East, and I've seen the damage that religious sectarianism can do. I'm not picking on any particular religion, but I feel, overall, that they often do more harm than good. So I feel very conflicted about organized religion, but I must admit that there's some religious art, both visual and musical, but especially musical, that takes away my will to resist it. There are particular pieces of Christian music that are so moving that I find myself assenting to their spirituality while I'm listening to the music. I suppose I tend to think of my religious feelings as kind of an 'evening' thing. At the end of the day, you often allow it. But when you wake up in the morning and the sunlight comes in, you think, 'Oh, that can't be true.' But later, when the evening comes, you're ready for it once again. I also have the feeling that the same thing might happen in the 'evening' of life.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 265-266. Current status Davis is professor emeritus of Persian at Ohio State University and previously a Bita Daryabari Professor of Persian Letters at Stanford University. He has received numerous academic and literary awards which have included the Ingram Merrill and Heinemann awards for poetry. While speaking of his fascination with the life stories of other immigrants and exiles, Davis spoke about how many he encountered while he and Afkham were living in Santa Barbara, California, \\"I was always coming across people, who, with very little prompting, would tell me about their journeys from China or Iraq or Vietnam. They were extraordinary stories of loss and adaptation, which is one of the great historical sagas of the last hundred years or so. It might sound strange, but it's one of the reasons why I love America. It's so accommodating to people like that, and so welcoming. Many people claim that America is very hard on foreigners; but, in fact, it's much more welcoming than anywhere else, and I find that a very noble aspect of American history.\\", William Baer (2016), Thirteenon Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 263-264.

It was translated into English by Donald Rayfield in 2012.  Synopsis  A Man Was Going Down the Road begins with the Greek legend of Jason and the Golden Fleece and the consequences for the obscure kingdom of Colchis after the Greek Jason comes and abducts Medea. But it is also an allegory of the treachery and destruction that ensued when Russia, and then the Soviets, annexed Georgia, as well as Chiladze's interpretation of life as a version of the ancient Anatolian story of Gilgamesh, and a study of Georgian life, domestic and political, in which women and children pay the price for the hero's quests, obsessions and doubts.  Plot  The novel is written in three parts, spanning generations. The first part, Aeëtes, tells the story of Phrixus and his upbringing by King AEetes, the king of Colchis. In his new land, Phrixos would always be an outsider “like a cuckoo’s egg” and forever in debt to the people who saved him and reared him. This is also the tale of Jason, the Argonauts, and the Golden Fleece. Jason arrives from Greece to steal the golden wool, but kidnaps Medea, the daughter of King AEetes, as she drugs her father in order to also steal the golden fleece of the winged ram. Young and handsome, Jason is regarded as a hero, although a “wrongdoer.” Part II, Ukheiro, is of a warrior, who breaks his leg in battle. His wife Marekhi dies in childbirth and Ukheiro's 10-year-old daughter Popina looks after her father and the new-born boy, Parnaoz. While waiting for death – for he can no longer fight as a warrior – Ukheiro takes up embroidery. His son Parnaoz falls madly in love with Ino, the seventh daughter of black-eyed Malalo. But theirs is a troubled relationship, and he has a competitor. Parnaoz's sister Popina has a son, Popeye, whose father flees at news of the pregnancy. As Popeye grows, he too falls in the love with Ino. The rivalry between Parnaoz and his nephew Popeye is intense, and Parnaoz eventually leaves Colchis for Crete. Part III, Parnaoz, is the story of Parnaoz's return to Colchis after about 10 years in Crete. But Ino has not yet married, and the rivalry between Parnaoz and Popeye continues. Parnaoz marries childhood friend, Tina, but he “didn’t care whom he married” for he was “looking for a refuge.. somewhere to hide from Ino.” Tina and Parnaoz soon have a son, little Ukheiro, but Parnaoz now wants to leave his wife. “Parnaoz knew only one thing: whether he got together with Ino or not, he could never accept not being with her, or any substitute life offered, or anything from life.” Interwoven in this section is also the tale of Icarus and Daedalus. In Greek mythology, father and son attempt to flee Crete with waxed and feathered wings. Icarus does not heed his father's warning, and flies too close to the sun. The heat melts the waxed wings, and he falls into the sea and drowns. What follows Parnaoz's disillusionment with his wife, and his constant pining for Ino, is the tragedy that comes from not heeding any warning, and from idealistic and obsessive love. Characters=Characters from the Mythology= Aeëtes – he was a King of Colchis in Greek mythology, son of the sun-god Helios and the Oceanid Perseis (a daughter of Oceanus), brother of Circe and Pasiphaë, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. The name means \\"eagle\\" (aietos). His consorts were Idyia and either Asterodia the Oceanid, Neaera the Nereid. According to others, he was brother of Perses, a king of Tauris, husband of his niece Hecate, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. Yet other versions make Aeëtes a native of Corinth and son of Ephyra, or else of a certain Antiope. Medea – is a sorceress who was the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis,Colchis was an ancient Georgian Kingdom niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios, and later wife to the hero Jason, with whom she had two children, Mermeros and Pheres. In Euripides's play Medea, Jason leaves Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers him his daughter, Glauce.Glauce is known as Creusa in Seneca's Medea and in Propertius 2.16.30. The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children. Absyrtus – was in Greek mythology the son of Aeëtes and a brother of Medea and Chalciope. His mother is variously given: Hyginus calls her Ipsia,Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae, 13. Hesiod and the Bibliotheca call her Idyia,Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 9. §23. Apollonius calls her Asterodeia,Apollonius of Rhodes, 3. 241. and others Neaera or Eurylyte.Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica When Medea fled with Jason, she took her brother Absyrtus with her, and when she was nearly overtaken by her father, she murdered her brother, cut his body into pieces and strewed them on the road, so that her father might thus be delayed by gathering the limbs of his child. Tomi, the place where this occurred, was believed to have derived its name from temno (, \\"cut\\").Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 9. §24; Ovid, Tristia 3. 9; compare Apollonius 4. 338, &c.; 460, &c.; Jason – he was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was famous for his role as the leader of the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea. Because he belongs to mythology, he may have existed before the Greek Dark Ages (1100–800 BC.) The people who wrote about Jason lived around 300 BC. Jason appeared in various literary works in the classical world of Greece and Rome, including the epic poem Argonautica and the tragedy Medea. In the modern world, Jason has emerged as a character in various adaptations of his myths, such as the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts and the 2000 miniseries of the same name. Jason is also the main character in the British television series Atlantis. Minos – he was the first King of Crete, son of Zeus and Europa. Every nine years, he made King Aegeus pick seven young boys and seven young girls to be sent to Daedalus' creation, the labyrinth, to be eaten by the Minotaur. After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in the underworld. The Minoan civilization of Crete has been named after him by the archaeologist Arthur Evans. By his wife, Pasiphaë (or some say Crete), he fathered Ariadne, Androgeus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Glaucus, Catreus, Acacallis and Xenodice. By a nymph, Pareia, he had four sons, Eurymedon, Nephalion, Chryses and Philolaus, who were killed by Heracles in revenge for the murder of the latter's two companions; and by Dexithea, one of the Telchines, he had a son called Euxanthius.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Library 3.1.2. By Androgeneia of Phaestus he had Asterion, who commanded the Cretan contingent in the war between Dionysus and the Indians.Nonnus, Dionysiaca, 13. 220ff. Also given as his children are Euryale, possibly the mother of Orion with Poseidon,Hyginus, Poetical Astronomy 2. 34 and Pholegander, eponym of the island Pholegandros.Stephanus of Byzantium s. v. Pholegandros Icarus – In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English; , Íkaros, Etruscan: VikareLarissa Bonfante, Judith Swaddling, Etruscan Myths, p. 43) is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus's father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, whereupon the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon. Daedalus – he was a skillful craftsman and artist.\\"This is the workshop of Daedalus,\\" wrote Philostratus of Lemnos in Immagines (1.16), \\"and about it are statues, some with forms blocked out, others in a quite complete state in that they are already stepping forward and give promise of walking about. Before the time of Daedalus, you know, the art of making statues had not yet conceived such a thing.\\". Cf. Frontisi-Ducroux He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx although this is unclear.  Major themes  Woodcut illustration of the escape of Jason with Medea and the death of her brother Absyrtis – Penn Provenance Project Chiladze wrote A Man Was Going Down the Road in the early 1970s while Georgia was still a part of the Soviet Union. The book is allegorical. In the story of how Colchis was overrun by outsiders – and native Colchians like Popeye were turned into informants and torturers – Chiladze is telling Georgia's story.

According to a government letter to then-British Resident, Major Lawrence in Kathmandu, 32 Bhardars (Nobles) were killed in the massacre catapulting Jung Bahadur, who later became Rana, to power. Historians have written about Abhiman Singh Rana Magar from different angles: some saying that he was not very interested in becoming Prime Minister of the country. However, few others contesting otherwise have written the queen had favoured him also.  Birth, childhood and education  No records so far are available as to who his parents were, birthplace, childhood and education also. But it can be fairly said that he was a 'literate person' because his signatures can be found in the government papers jointly signed together with then Prime Ministers Bhimsen Thapa and Mathabar singh Thapa also.  Prime Ministerial contender  The British Resident to Nepal Major Lawrence's letter, paragraph four, of August 26, 1845, to British Government clearly states that General Abhiman Singh Rana Magar was also a prime ministerial contender as the seat had fallen vacant since sometime already. But he seemed to be 'declining the dangerous office'. (Stiller 1981:285). In another letter to his government on September 23, 1845, Resident Lawrence wrote, a council of minister was formed consisting of \\"Chautaria Fatteh Jung and Kazis Gagan Singh, Abhiman Rana and Dalbhanjan Pandey\\" . Minister Abhiman Singh Rana Magar, retaining his job in the army as general, had two regiments under him. He was Mulki Dewan, which would mean a minister responsible for home affairs: managing internal affairs east of Palpa.  The Kot Massacre, September 15, 1846  General Gagan Singh Bhandari was mysteriously killed while he was worshipping some deity at his residence on September 14, 1846. The Queen Laxmi Devi ordered all Bhardars to report themselves to the Kot, at present day Hanuman Dhoka in Kathmandu. The furious Queen, as a wounded lioness, ordered out loud to bring in front of her and punish whoever might have killed General Gagan Singh. (\\"The queen was addressing her agitation to the assemblage including Prime Minister Fatteh Jung Shah, and General Abhiman Singh Rana Magar\\" ) Jung Bahadur's gesture toward Kaji Bir Keshar Pande(a rival of Kazi Gagan Singh Bhandari) prompted the dangerously enraged Queen to order Abhiman Singh Rana to sever the former's head. The reason probably because, he was then interior minister - 'Mulki Dewan' of the country. But Abhiman Singh Rana Magar begged King's approval to execute the job. A heated debate followed and the situation turned so tense and dangerous, Abhiman Singh Rana Magar wanted to dash out. A sepoy at the gate blocked and bayoneted at his chest. The dying Abhiman Singh Rana Magar wrote a letter in Nepali 'Ja' on the Kot wall with the blood gushing out of his chest suggestive of Jung Bahadur Rana being the culprit.Rana 2003:66 In the government letter to the British resident in Kathmandu 32 Bhardars are listed as killedStiller 1981: 304 - 306 but the number should have been far more than stated.

Mexican juice bars are popular establishments in many parts of Mexico and more recently in Mexican American communities in South-Western United States. Mexican juice bars serve a lot of the same foods as the popular fruit and juice stands and roadside carts in Mexico. The advantage of a juice bar is that it can provide more menu items, refrigerate its ingredients, keeping them fresh for longer periods of time, and juice bars are also generally cleaner and more comfortable as they offer guests a place to sit down and enjoy their food. Mexican juice bars can be stand alone businesses or part of a larger establishment like a carnicería (Mexican meat market). Mexican juice bars are also sometimes combined with panaderías (Mexican bakeries) or taquerías (Mexican taco shops).

Case In 1802, Steinunn Sveinsdóttir and Bjarni Bjarnason mutually murdered their respective spouses in Sjöundá in Iceland. The case became famous as the Morðin á Sjöundá (The Sjöundá Murders). They were both arrested, subjected to torture and sentenced to death. However, it was no longer legal to perform executions on Iceland at that time, so they were to be brought to Norway for their execution. Steinunn Sveinsdóttir died in prison before she could be taken to Norway, but Bjarni Bjarnason was shipped to Norway, where he was executed in 1805.

Mehit or Mehyt was an ancient Egyptian goddess. In the Early Dynastic period she was depicted as a reclining lioness with three bent poles projecting from her back. In that era she appears in numerous early dynastic sealings and ivory artifacts, usually together with a representation of an Upper Egyptian shrine.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt, Routledge; (2001), , p. 290 Her main places of worship were Hierakonpolis and Thinis.Emery, W.B. (1961) Archaic Egypt, Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 125 Mehit was the consort of Anhur, or Onuris, a hunter god who was worshipped in Thinis. Various texts allude to a myth in which Anhur tracks down Mehit in Nubia and brings her to Egypt as his wife. This event is the basis for Anhur's name, which means \\"bringer-back of the distant one\\". Late sources identify this story with the \\"Distant Goddess\\" myth, in which the Eye of Ra—a solar deity who can take the form of several goddesses—runs away from her father Ra, who sends one of the gods to retrieve her. In the version with Anhur and Mehit, Anhur is syncretized with Shu and Mehit with Hathor-Tefnut, Shu's mythological sister and wife. Because Shu and Tefnut sometimes represented the sun and moon, Mehit could also represent the full moon. Her return to her proper place could thus represent the restoration of the Eye of Horus, a symbol of the moon and of the divine order of the cosmos.Pinch, Geraldine (2004). Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of Ancient Egypt. Oxford University Press. pp. 71–73, 177 Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Distant Goddess may have originally been a personification of the wild deserts of Nubia, whose myth was absorbed into a complex of myths surrounding the Eye of Ra. Toby Wilkinson says that in Early Dynastic times she may have been a protector goddess, associated with holy places.

A client of the FitzAlan Earls of Arundel, he served them in war and peace, helping consolidate their domination of his native county of Shropshire. He represented Shropshire twice in the House of Commons of England. He died by his own hand. Background and early life John Darras was the son of: Ralph Darras or Daras of Neenton and Joan Forcer, daughter and coheiress of Thomas Forcer,Roskell et al, DARRAS, John (c.1355–1408), of Sidbury and Neenton, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger and, together with her sisters Burga and Elizabeth, coheiress of Sir Henry Ribbesford of Ribbesford, near Bewdley in Worcestershire, who was the brother of their grandmother, Avice or Hawise le Forcer.Page and Willis-Bund: Ribbesford with the Borough of Bewdley – Manors The Darras family were not large landowners but part of the emerging landed gentry. Ralph Darras held the manors of Neenton and Sidbury,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Addendum to Vol. X, no. 355. both south- west of Bridgnorth in Shropshire, part of the Welsh Marches. Although most such families were of Anglo-Norman origin, Darras, originally rendered de Arras, or d'Arras, signifies origins in Arras, historically the chief town of Artois in Flanders.Hanks et al, p. 160 It is generally rendered Daras in late medieval documents.Feudal Aids, volume 4, p. 246. Ralph Darras, John's father, died in December 1461, when John was only about seven years of age. This was during the second major outbreak of the Black Death in Shropshire,Baugh and Elrington (1989), Domesday Book: 1300–1540, note anchor 23. although there is no record of Ralph Darras's cause of death. The plague brought great economic shifts alongside the human cost. Shropshire inquisitions post mortem taken during the plague outbreak show that land lay uncultivated and some landowners struggled to pay even very modest rents,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Volume 11, File 166, no. 233. and some estates were considered worthless.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Volume 11, File 179, no. 537. While the majority of the rural population was placed at an advantage by labour shortages, landlords were forced to relax conditions imposed on tenants and to buy in labour.Baugh and Elrington (1989), Domesday Book: 1300–1540: Demesne agriculture, note anchor 196-199. This is the economic and agrarian background to John Darras's lifelong struggles to consolidate and extend his estates and to find additional sources of income, mainly through business and military service. John Darras's mother, Joan, must also have died in his childhood. He fought legal battles to secure her inheritance, but alongside his aunts, not his mother.

The nave was already old by the time of Darras, as it was built in the 12th century, although the whole building underwent restoration in 1881.Church of Holy Trinity at Historic England. St Leonard's church at Ribbesford. The manor was the focus of early attempts by Darras to enlarge his holdings. There has been a small church on the site since about 1100. It was enlarged from the early 15th century, with modifications including the present nave.Page and Willis-Bund: Ribbesford with the Borough of Bewdley – ChurchesChurch of St Leonard at Historic England. The inquisition following his father's death, taken at Bridgnorth on 19 March 1362, shows that the main estates Darras inherited from his father were the manors of Sidbury and Neenton, which were held of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Volume 11, File 168, no. 270. in return for providing a hobelar (a light cavalryman mounted on a hobby) for Wigmore Castle when there was war in the Welsh Marches. There were also a few other small, scattered holdings, notably a third of the manor of Linley, held of the Prior of Wenlock.Currie et al, Linley – Manor and other estates. This was a small patrimony and Darras fought legal battles, sometimes backed by force, at several points in his life to extend his holdings, although with limited success. In 1379,Page and Willis-Bund: Ribbesford with the Borough of Bewdley – Manors, note anchor 193 and again in 1383,Page and Willis-Bund: Ribbesford with the Borough of Bewdley – Manors, footnote 196 Darras and his aunts Burga and Elizabeth contested ownership of the manors of Ribbesford and Rock, Worcestershire, which had been held by Sir Henry Ribbesford, also under the Mortimers of Wigmore. They were opposed by John de Resunden, the husband of their distant relative, Iseult. They won their suit but for reasons unknown the estates were bothPage and Willis-Bund: Rock or Ake – Manors. soon in the hands of Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, one of the Lords Appellant, who was temporarily stripped of all his lands during Richard II's counter-coup of 1397. A medieval monk, depicted on a gravestone at Rock. The church was monastic property. Patronage of the churches on most of these estates, potentially a lucrative right, went to Darras. The rectory of Sidbury was in his gift and he is known to have made presentations to it. On 16 June 1386 Darras authorised an exchange of clergy, by which the local priest went to St Katherine's chapel in Hereford Cathedral and the former cathedral chaplain, Philip Kentles, became rector of Sidbury.Registrum Johannis Gilbert, p. 125. St Katherine's chapel served the Bishop's Palace,Hereford: Ecclesiastical in An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Herefordshire, Volume 1, South west. so this exchange must have been of importance to John Gilbert, presumably earning Darras a modicum of episcopal favour. In April 1392 Darras appointed a successor after Philip's death.Registrum Johannis Trefnant, p. 176. At Neenton too Darras held and used the advowson, presenting Roger Murimore as incumbent of the church in November 1399.Registrum Johannis Trefnant, p. 183. Linley's church was a chapel of Holy Trinity Church in Much Wenlock,Currie et al, Linley – Church. which was in the hands of Wenlock Priory, the feudal overlord, leaving Darras with no control. However, while he had effective control of Ribbesford, the advowson must have been his to exercise, as it went with the manor.Page and Willis-Bund: Ribbesford with the Borough of Bewdley – Advowsons. In the case of Rock, however, the principal manor in the parish was not Rock itself but Alton, and the advowson of the church went with it: although there had been challenges from the Ribbesford family, the advowson was held by the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in Normandy during the 14th century.Page and Willis-Bund: Rock or Ake – Advowson. As a substantial, if not grand, landowner, Darras was evidently enjoyed a degree of trust among the local landed gentry. He is known to have acted for others in land transactions, including Malcolm de la Mare, Thomas Whitton and John Meisy.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 3365/67/40, Recognizances 1377–1378, at Discovering Shropshire's History. His business associates tend to recur as personal and family allies throughout his known career. Derived from the table given by Wrottesley.Wrottesley. Pedigrees from the Plea Rolls, p. 134. and further information from the Victoria County History. Marriage and family Remains of the medieval keep at Moreton Corbet Castle, with the curtain wall curving around to the gatehouse, restored in the mid-16th century on the right. On the right are remains of the Elizabethan house. The Corbets of Moreton Corbet were themselves powerful allies but also, like Darras, found further security in the Arundel affinity. Darras married Joan Corbet. The marriage took place before 1390. However, as Darras is not recorded as active on Joan's behalf in the Corbet property disputes of 1385, it must have been in the second half of the 1380s. Darras formally entered the Arundel affinity in 1387, which may coincide approximately with his marriage. Joan Corbet was the daughter of Sir Robert Corbet (died 1375) of Moreton Corbet, and Elizabeth Le Strange, daughter of Fulk, 1st Baron Strange of Blackmere.Corbet, pedigree facing p.368, The Corbets of Moreton Corbet had taken over as the senior line of Corbets in the region, as the Corbets at Caus Castle had petered out in 1347. The Le Strange family were another important dynasty of Marcher Lords with many branches. The Blackmere barony was of fairly recent foundation. Elizabeth's father was called to parliament by Edward II and served him as Seneschal of Gascony,Fulk Lestrange at the Gascon Rolls Project (1317–1478), accessed 4 December 2013 the head of the administration of the remaining Plantagenet possessions in France. The title could be passed through both male and female, and the tortuous line of descent of the Le Stranges may have been one of the factors predisposing the Corbets towards reinforcing male primogeniture through dubious property transactions. From 1383 it passed via female descent and marriage to the Talbot family, and was one of the many titles collected together by John Talbot, Baron Furnivall and later Earl of Shrewsbury. Joan was the widow of Robert de Harley of Willey and had a daughter and heiress, Alice, who married Sir Hamo Peshall or Hamon Peshale. Joan brought a range of properties, acquired from her own family and her first husband, which must have greatly increased Darras's comfort and security while she was alive. She had a considerable amount of jointure property from her first marriage – in Shropshire at Harley, Gretton, Willey and Kenley, and in Worcestershire part of a manor at Hampton Lovett, known as Over Hall.A History of the County of Worcester: Volume 3: Hampton Lovett – Manors, cf. footnote 28. Some of these properties passed to Roger Willey, a relative of Sir Robert Harley, in 1400, presumably on Joan's death: Willey was a business associate of Darras. The Hampton Lovett property, however, was destined for Alice, Joan and Robert Harley's daughter, who married Sir Hamo Peshall. Joan was almost certainly some years older than Darras. It is not clear whether they had children, although Darras may have left a son named Roger. Joan seems to have died around the turn of the century, with her properties largely leaving his control, prompting Darras to an active and fairly successful search for further sources of income in the years following. Joan's family, the Corbets of Moreton Corbet Castle were one of the rising gentry families, steadily increasing their estates and their influence.Baugh and Elrington (1989), Domesday Book: 1300–1540: Landlords However, they were not of the first rank, and both they and Darras were increasingly to seek advancement through the affinity of the FitzAlans, the Earls of Arundel, who were supreme both economically and politically in Shropshire as well being among the greatest magnates in England. The Corbet property disputes Richard II, who intervened in and profited from the Corbet property disputes. Joan Corbet's brother, Sir Roger, was preoccupied with family disputes over property, many of which involved Joan. Darras inevitably took his wife's side, sometimes bringing him into disrepute with the king and his government. Roger Corbet had two older brothers, Thomas and John, as well as a younger brother, John, and sisters, including Joan, who was possibly the eldest of the siblings.Visitation of Shropshire, p. 134. Roger and Joan's parents, Robert and Elizabeth Corbet, had been concerned to keep the family estates together in a time of short life-spans and tortuous succession that affected many landowning families. As the eldest son, Thomas, predeceased his parents, the initial target had been to prevent the estates going to Elizabeth, his daughter, who had married Sir John Ipstones, a quarrelsome and sometimes violent man who served twice as MP for Staffordshire.Roskell et al, IPSTONES, Sir John (d.1394), of Blymhill, Staffs. – Author: C.R. In the 1360s they initiated a complex series of property transactions, using the device of fine of lands, and intended to keep the bulk of the Corbet lands effectively in tail, favouring in particular Fulk and Roger.Corbet, p.241 The provisions of these fines were contested by Ipstones and Elizabeth from the outset. However, after the death of Fulk in 1382, much worse followed. Some of the provisions were revealed as mutually-contradictory. Fulk's daughter and sole heiress, also Elizabeth, contested effective ownership of property that had been assigned for life, under a fine of 1363,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Richard II, Volume 15, File 25, no. 742. to Joan and her first husband, Sir Robert Harley of Willey,Feet of Fines for Shropshire, CP 25/1/195/16, number 42, Abstract at Medieval Genealogy and Photograph of original document at Anglo-American Legal Tradition. who died around 1370, with the remainder to Fulk and the heirs of his body. These lands at Yockleton, Shelve, Wentnor and Caus Forest, were all on the western side of Shropshire, close to the Welsh border and Joan and Harley leased them for the remainder of their lives to Sir Fulk for a rent of £60 a year.Feet of Fines for Shropshire, CP 25/1/195/16, number 43, Abstract at Medieval Genealogy and Photograph of original document at Anglo-American Legal Tradition. However, in 1367, they levied a fine to ensure estates passed to Roger in the event of Fulk's death.Feet of Fines for Shropshire, CP 25/1/195/17, number 12, Abstract at Medieval Genealogy and Photograph of original document at Anglo-American Legal Tradition. As Joan was still alive when Sir Fulk died in 1382, his daughter, Elizabeth, had a reasonable expectation of continuing to lease the lands under the fine of 1363. Joan, however, intended the lands to go immediately to her younger brother, Roger, according to the fine of 1367. She had reiterated the position after Harley's death in a new fine in 1376,Feet of Fines for Shropshire, CP 25/1/195/17, number 56, Abstract at Medieval Genealogy and Photograph of original document at Anglo-American Legal Tradition. and this position was assumed by the inquisition post mortem following Sir Fulk's death.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Richard II, Volume 15, File 25, no. 743. There was a series of legal claims and counter-claims, with the Crown intervening to try to secure an escheat while the young Elizabeth was still a minor. However, Roger emerged victorious in 1385.Roskell et al, CORBET, Sir Roger (d.1395), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger When Elizabeth, Fulk's daughter attained the age of majority in 1390, the entire issue was re-opened. Elizabeth was now married to John Mawddwy or de la Pole, lord of Dinas Mawddwy, who vigorously pursued his wife's claim. Darras, now married to Joan, was just as vigorous in pursuing the interests of Joan and her brother, Roger. The king, Richard II was informed that \\"strife and debate\\" was threatening the peace in Shropshire. It seems that violence had broken out at the beginning of June. It is unlikely that Darras, already an experienced fighting man, was uninvolved, as on 7 June 1390 he was the first of those ordered to appear before King Richard II and his Council in Chancery on 23 June, on pain of forfeiting 200 marks.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389–1392, p. 142. Writs in the same terms were issued to seven others, including Sir Roger Corbet and Malcolm de la Mare, Darras's business associate and recently MP for Herefordshire.Roskell et al, MARE, Malcolm de la (d.c.1399), of Yatton and Little Hereford, Herefs. and Kidderminster, Worcs. – Author: Charles Kightly. A further writ to the Sheriff ordered him to compel their attendance.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389–1392, p. 143. However, the arrangements for the court appearance were changed and on 22 June writs were issued, this time naming Joan as well as John Darras, ordering the quarrelling gentry to appear instead at the next Shrewsbury assizes before Sir Robert Charleton.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389–1392, p. 199. Charleton and Sir John Hill were authorised to take security for good behaviour from them and to familiarise themselves in advance with the complexities of the case.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1388–1392, p. 340. The delay was accompanied by an order for Edward Acton, the Shropshire escheator personally to take the disputed estates into the king's hands, pending a resolution.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389–1392, p. 202. After further delays, which were very profitable to king who was pocketing the proceeds, an agreement was reached and on 25 April 1391 the escheator was ordered to cease meddling with the estates.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389–1392, p. 256. It seems they were assigned to the Mawddwys, and later to their daughter Elizabeth, who married Hugh Burgh, a future MP for Shropshire and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. However, it is likely that Joan and Darras received the consolation of regular rent from them. While losing the case was a blow to prestige, leasing was actually the preferred option among Shropshire landowners like the Corbets, who had been renting out demesne lands to secure a regular income in uncertain times.Baugh and Elrington (1989), Domesday Book: 1300–1540 – The leasing of the demesnes. It is also possible that there was a large sum for Joan and John Darras at the ouset of the tenancy: the Recognizances preserved in the county archives show that in September 1391 John de Mowche (presumably a rendering of Mawddwy, which is given as Mouthe in the Close Rolls) undertook to pay John Darras 1000 marks at Easter 1392.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 3365/67/45v, Recognizances 1391–1392, at Discovering Shropshire's History.

Effigy of John Talbot, later Earl of Shrewsbury, in St Alkmund's Church, Whitchurch. A distinguished campaigner in the Hundred Years' War, Talbot seems to have gained control of Darras's estates. Darras formally enlisted as an esquire in the retinue of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel in 1387. Among others to do so, and probably thereby form a political and personal bond with Arundel, was Thomas Whitton,Roskell et al, WHITTON, Thomas (d.1411), of Whitton near Burford, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger. a long-term associate of Darras. At this point Arundel was one of the Lords Appellant, a leader of the opposition to Richard II's favourites and his policy of peace with France. Darras served with him in a naval campaign against the French, which culminated in a significant victory off Margate. As a client of the earl, and in association with two other members of his affinity, John Burley and Fulk Sprenghose, Darras was made trustee of estates belonging to Richard, 4th Lord Talbot, who was married to Arundel's niece, Ankaret le Strange of Blackmere.Le Strange, p. 288. In 1393 he represented his county in the parliament that began on 20 January and lasted about three weeks. His fellow MP was Sir William Hugford, who was closely associated with John le Strange, 6th Baron Strange of Knockin: although powerful, the 11th Earl of Arundel seems to have been much happier to share influence than was to prove the case with his son. Arundel was executed in Richard II's purge of 1397. The inquisition into the earl's Shropshire lands listed the numerous small grants of land he had made to his affinity and others whom he needed to cultivate. One of these was a small estate at Gretton, Shropshire, held by Darras and worth 40 shillings annually.Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous (Chancery), 1392–1399, p. 114. It seems, however, that Darras also had good contacts in the Lancastrian affinity. Earlier in the year, together with Edward Whitton, Henry Wynnesbury, and Fulk Pembridge, Darras was involved in some transaction that required each to pay £200 to Sir Walter Blount,Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 3365/67/47, Recognizances 1396–1397, at Discovering Shropshire's History. An important participant in John of Gaunt's military adventures abroad and his leading representative in the Midlands.Roskell et al, BLOUNT, Sir Walter (d.1403), of Barton Blount, Derbys. – Author: C.R. When John of Gaunt's son and dispossessed successor, Henry Bolingbroke arrived in England to challenge Richard in 1399, the Arundels rallied to the cause of the House of Lancaster, formerly their bitter enemies: the dead earl's son, Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel, and brother, Thomas Arundel, the Archbishop of Canterbury, became mainstays of the government of Bolingbroke, who came to the throne as Henry IV. Darras seems to have good connections with both parts of the victorious coalition and from this point he contrived to remain in royal favour, albeit sometimes with difficulty. He was made keeper for life of Morfe and Shirlet, areas of Royal forest on either side of the Severn in Shropshire, by letters patent of 4 November 1399.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399–1401, p. 64. After his loyal service against the Glyndŵr Rising in Wales, a major preoccupation of both Arundel and the king, further letters patent in February 1407, described Darras as the \\"king's esquire,\\" and confirmed that the office was indeed a reward for his military service and permitted him to appoint a ranger as a deputy to act in his absences.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405–1408, p. 296. It was probably his connection with the FitzAlans that assured his appointment as High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1401-2. Before he took up the shrievalty, his friend Sir John Cornwall, a former sheriff and also a former retainer of John of Gaunt, was accused of cattle rustling at Wytheford (also rendered Withiford) in Shropshire.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, volume 15, p. 102. Cornwall counted as family, as he was a grandson of Fulk, 1st Baron Strange of Blackmere, and so a first cousin of Darras's wife. However, the case affected the king's interests, as the plaintiffs, who were demanding £100, alleged that their cattle had already been taken into the custody of the county escheator when Cornwall removed them.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, volume 15, p. 103. In April 1402 Darras was one of four local gentry who stood surety at Westminster for Cornwall that he would keep the peace,Calendar of Close Rolls, 1399–1402, p. 555. an act that potentially created a conflict of interest. However, the plaintiffs alleged that Darras went much further. When the case was moved to the Shrewsbury assizes by a writ of nisi prius it was claimed that Darras allowed Cornwall to select the jurors. The jury was dismissed and Darras was ordered to summon a new panel for the next assizes. Darras was also the returning officer when Cornwall was elected to Parliament. Cornwall was a man of considerable prestige, claiming descent from King John,Roskell et al, CORNWALL, Sir John (c.1366–1414), of Kinlet, Salop. – Authors: J.S. Roskell/L.S. Woodger but an unstable and dangerous associate, who was to attract constant accusations of violence and intimidation. The 12th Earl exercised a much tighter grip on power in the region than his father, dominating parliamentary representation at every election. It was Darras's turn again in 1404, when he was sent to Parliament with John Burley, another lawyer who worked mainly for the Fitzalans and who had fought alongside Darras in the naval campaign of 1387.Roskell et al, BURLEY, John I (d.1415/16), of Broncroft in Corvedale, Salop. – Author: L.S. Woodger Burley had also held the wardship of Robert Corbet, the heir of Sir Roger and nephew of Joan. Darras could not entirely escape penalty when in 1406 he and Roger Willey bought two properties held in capita without obtaining royal approval: a quarter carucate of land at Worfield and a moiety of the forestership of Morfe. However, a pardon was granted on 15 November for a mere 6s. 8d.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405–1408, p. 271. Darras and Willey then resold both properties to Richard Parlour, a burgess of Bridgnorth, again without asking permission: Parlour was compelled to sue and pay for pardon in 1408, after Darras's death.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405–1408, p. 426.Roskell et al, PARLOUR, Richard, of Bridgnorth, Salop. – Author: L.S. Woodger In 1407 Darras, together with Robert Corbet, Roger Corbet, nephews of Joan, and William Ryman of Sussex – all of Arundel's affinity – were among a group of Shropshire gentry who granted a burgage in Shrewsbury, known as Ireland Hall, to Shrewsbury Abbey for pious purposes.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405–1408, p. 339.Roskell et al, CORBET, Robert (1383–1420), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger The licence to accept this gift, which cost the abbey the considerable sum of 10 marks, was granted on 20 July. The younger Corbets had enlisted with Arundel about two years previously and were to acquire sinister reputations for violence and lawlessness. They and their uncle probably granted Ireland Hall on behalf of Arundel. The abbot of Shrewsbury, Thomas Prestbury, was a client of Archbishop Arundel, the earl's uncle, and had been imprisoned in 1399 for preaching against the government of Richard II. Later in the year Darras attended the election of knights of the shire, witnessing the return of Cornwall and David Holbache, a prominent lawyer and a close associate of Arundel.Roskell et al, HOLBACHE, David (d.c.1422), of Dudleston and Oswestry, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger This was Darras's last important public appearance. Death and aftermath Darras hanged himself at Neenton, probably during March 1408. The evidence for the date is a commission from the king, issued on 30 March, to four Shropshire gentry to investigate possible concealment of the deceased's goods,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405–1408, p. 485. which as a suicide, escheated to the Crown. A formal order for the escheator to take his estates into the hands of the king was issued on 24 May.Calendar of Fine Rolls, 1405–1413, p. 120. His holdings would normally have reverted to their feudal overlords but the young Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March was the centre of plots against Henry IV and much of his property was temporarily or permanently forfeit. Considerable confusion and disputes seem to have followed Darras's unusual and untimely death. At Sidbury the advowson was contested. On 6 July, as a new rector was needed at Sidbury, Henry St George acted as patron, presenting William Walkebache. On 11 August, however, John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall, also acting as patron and described as lord of Sidbury, presented Walter Lawrence.Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 173. Talbot, the young son of Richard, Lord Talbot, and Ankaret le Strange, was to emerge as Arundel's main political rival in the county, prepared to fight force with force.Roskell et al, Shropshire – Author: L. S. Woodger On 23 August Bishop Robert Mascall was issued with a writ probiting him from admitting anyone to Sidbury until the issue was decided.Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 66. The following April the bishop himself presented William Whitehead.Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 174. By August 1409 Whitehead had resigned and Talbot presented his nominee for a second time,Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 175. apparently triumphant in the struggle to take over Darras's lands and rights. The same pattern is shown at Linley, which probably fell into his hands, as his widow, Margaret Beauchamp, Countess of Shrewsbury, held half the manor as a jointure property after his death. Similar confusions arose over Darras's keepership of Morfe and Shirlet. Soon after Darras's death the king conferred the office on Sir John Cornwall, removing it from Nicholas Gerard, on the grounds that the office had not been vacant when Gerard acquired it,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405–1408, p. 424. although the story behind the recital of facts is mysterious. There were several Shrewsbury business men named Nicholas Gerard in the 14th centuryShropshire Archives search for Nicholas Gerard at Discovering Shropshire's History. and this seems to be the one served as MP in 1399Roskell et al, GERARD, Nicholas (d.1421), of Shrewsbury, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger and bailiff in 1412.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 3365/67/12v at Discovering Shropshire's History. Cornwall soon proved himself tyrannical in office. By March 1410 the king was ordering Arundel and his legal team, John Burley, David Holbache and Thomas Young,Roskell et al, YOUNG, (YONGE), Thomas I, of Sibdon Carwood, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger together with Lord Furnival, to investigate breaches of customary manorial and grazing rights at Worfield in Morff Forest,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408–1413, p. 182. made by Arundel's brother-in-law, William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny. Cornwall was clearly quite reckless in his depredations, as there had been similar complaints from William Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Groby. Joan Beauchamp, Arundel's sister continued to complain about Cornwall into 1412, after she was widowed,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408–1413, p. 377. prompting a further commission of inquiry by the same team. The following year the king received similar complaints from John Marshall, Dean of the royal free chapel at BridgnorthCalendar of Patent Rolls, 1408–1413, p. 477. It seems that, before sending in Arundel's lawyers to investigate, the king secured Cornwall's resignation and on 13 February 1413 installed Roger Willey, Darras's old business partner, as keeper in his place.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408–1413, p. 465.

She made her musical debut in 2008, with the release of a solo album entitled Deeper Lurking, under the moniker Birds Fled from Me. She is best known as the lead vocalist of the band Only You, and formerly as co-lead vocalist of San Francisco psych-rockers Sleepy Sun, as well as for collaborations with UNKLE and progressive rock band Anywhere. She is currently singing with the Canadian rock band Black Mountain and drumming for the Russian feminist protest punk rock group Pussy Riot. As a solo artist, Fannan has shared the stage with other prominent musicians such as Hunter Burgan (AFI), Carla Azar (Autolux), Rich Good (Psychedelic Furs), and Dash Hutton (Haim and Mini Mansions).  Early life  Fannan was born in Thousand Oaks, California. She is the eldest daughter of composer and pianist Michael Glenn Williams and Marlene Marie Longamore. She has a younger brother, Michael Gaelen Williams, and a younger sister, Caitlin Elizabeth Williams. Fannan spent much of her childhood encouraged to sing and perform; she later recalled acquiring a key to her school's choir room, where she would often eat her lunch and play the piano. She attended Ascension Lutheran, a private preparatory school in Thousand Oaks, and Banyan Elementary. She abstained from required performances throughout high school, devoting most of her time to extra curricular clubs and activities. She attended Santa Monica City College for six months, before dropping out to move to Santa Cruz, California.  Birds Fled from Me  Between 2005 and 2008, Fannan wrote and recorded solo material under the moniker Birds Fled from Me. With producer/engineer Maxwell Lewis Golding, she released a lo-fi album entitled Deeper Lurking in 2008.  Sleepy Sun  In 2007, while performing in Santa Cruz, California, Fannan was invited to sit in with psych rockers Sleepy Sun, and was quickly recruited to be their co-lead vocalist. Her vocals are featured on the band's first two albums Embrace (ATP Recordings, 2009) and Fever (ATP Recordings, 2010); both albums, recorded with producer Colin Stewart at the Hive in Vancouver, B.C., do not physically credit Fannan. Fannan left the band due to mental health reasons in late October 2010.  Collaborations  During and soon after leaving Sleepy Sun, Fannan recorded with British trip-hop duo UNKLE. Her first collaboration \\"Follow Me Down\\" is credited as a Sleepy Sun feature, but primarily features Fannan, her lyrics, and melody. \\"Sunday Song\\", also featuring Fannan, was released as part of their Only the Lonely EP, and Where Did the Night Fall – Another Night Out album. Following a short stint supporting Dinosaur Jr. frontman J Mascis, Fannan was approached by Christian Eric Beaulieu (Triclops!) to collaborate on the musical project Anywhere, which also included Mike Watt (Minutemen, The Stooges) and Cedric Bixler- Zavala (The Mars Volta, At the Drive-In). Fannan sang lead vocals on their debut single \\"Dead Golden West\\" (Valley King Records, November 2011) and on the song \\"Rosa Rugosa\\" on their self-titled debut Anywhere (ATP Recordings, 2012). In late 2012, she toured as keyboard player and backing vocalist for The Fresh & Onlys.  Only You  Created in late 2010, Only You is Fannan's L.A. based retro rock band, whose lineup has included a rotating cast of backing musicians. In early 2012, the band began performing as an all-female group, with Fannan being joined by bassist Micayla Grace (Bleached, Leopold and His Fiction), guitarist Cecilia Peruti (Gothic Tropic), and drummer Lia Braswell (Le Butcherettes). Only You released their first single \\"Applying Myself\\" through White Iris Records in October 2012. The b-side \\"Love Is Making Me Tired\\" was featured as a Daily Download on Rolling Stone's website. In 2015 Fannan later released another single through a different label Hit City U.S.A as Only You, \\"Let Me Burn\\", the b-side to this was \\"The Pressure\\". As of 2013, the Only You lineup features Fannan, backed by an all-male band, including lead guitarist Brandon Intelligator (Slang Chickens), Jeff Lynne (Wires on Fire), Lucas Ventura (RACES), and Patrick Taylor (Ceremonies). Other musicians that have previously played with the group include Amy Aileen Wood, Jon Sortland (Cigar, Broken Bells), Rich Good (Kings & Queens, Psychedelic Furs), Evan Weiss (Slang Chickens, Wires on Fire), Dash Hutton (Slang Chickens, Wires on Fire, Papa).

Life Macdonald was born in Elgin on 30 January 1862. His father, James Macdonald, was a schoolmaster at Elgin Academy and his mother was Margaret Raff. His father moved from Elgin Academy to Ayr Academy during his early youth. Macdonald was educated at Ayr Academy where his father had become rector. He studied in Germany and France, then at the University of Edinburgh and Balliol College, Oxford, graduating Master of Arts in 1887. He then took up a post teaching Classics at Kelvinside Academy. In 1892 he began lecturing in Greek at Glasgow University as Gilbert Murray's assistant. At this time he lived at 21 Lilybank Gardens in Glasgow.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1904-5 Macdonald was involved in archaeological excavations from 1902, when he excavated Bar Hill Fort with Alexander Park. One of his obituaries says \\"scholarship is not incompatible with administrative ability\\". He employed \\"scientific method and equipment\\" in his fieldwork and excavations, resulting in new discoveries in the discipline of Romano-British history. Macdonald's father had also an interest in Roman archaeology. His book The Roman Wall in Scotland (1911, revised 1934) was important in that it \\"drew together all known sites into one comprehensive volume\\". Macdonald was a significant influence on Anne Strachan Robertson, one of his students; her obituary states that \\"Her own rich contribution owed much to the influence of Sir George Macdonald, who dominated Romano-British studies between the world wars. From him she imbibed the patience in noting details and the dispassionate weighing of evidence that Macdonald had so admired in Francis Haverfield, an earlier giant in the field\\". In 1904 Macdonald left academia to join the civil service as Assistant Secretary to the Scottish Education Directorates, being promoted to Secretary in 1922. He is \\"best remembered for establishing the Leaving Certificate Examination and for introducing the first superannuation scheme for teachers in Scotland\\". He retired in 1928. He married Margaret Tannahill Younger (1857-1951) in 1897. They had three children; George Henry Macdonald who died in infancy (1899-1899), Isobel Margaret Macdonald (1900-1927) and James Younger Macdonald (1902-1960). Macdonald died in Edinburgh on 9 August 1940, and is buried in the 20th-century extension to Dean Cemetery on Queensferry Road in western Edinburgh with his family. He bequeathed around two hundred books on classical archaeology to the library at Edinburgh University. Awards and positions From 1892-1904 Macdonald catalogued the collection of Greek coins in the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Glasgow, and as a result was made Honorary Curator for life in 1905. This also led to him being awarded the prix Allier de Hauteroche in (1907). From 1921-26 he was president of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, and from 1935-36 the president of the Royal Numismatic Society.

The best known of the Seven Valleys, is the Valley of the Canche. The river Canche has its headwaters near Magnicourt sur Canche. The Ternoise and Course flow into it along its 96 kilometre winding journey to its vast estuary in the Channel just north of Le Touquet at Etaples sur Mer and many restaurants and auberges are to be found along the way, especially between Montreuil and Etaples. The river is populated with rainbow trout, sea trout, eel, pike and roach and although you can walk along both banks, the right hand side is more picturesque. The river follows the lie of the land flowing past chalk hillsides and its path is frequently indicated by the presence of willows. The farms, set low down, are often built of whitewashed cob. Overview In the course of history, the 7 Valleys is said to have been owned by the English, the Spanish and finally the French. Depicted by The Sunday Times, UK, as Northern France's best kept secret, the Seven Valleys is also called the Artois Valleys abounding in “rolling contours, as green and bushy as anything you will come across in Dordogne”. Other notable places, a midst beautiful villages and rolling fields, include the Opal Coast and the historic battlefields of Azincourt and Crecy. The place boasts of a splendid getaway for visitors to get an insight into the serene lifestyle of the French people and the local history of the place. Boasting a number of rivers, both calm and wild, rivers like the Canche and the Authie (river) are home to river otters. The historical site of the Battle of Agincourt, where the French Cavalry had to see a heavy defeat in 1415 at the hands of the British, holds a modern interactive museum. Every year an archery competition is held at this battle site. Access to this historical place is easy via Channel Ports and on the Boulogne to Arras railway line. For accommodation, the place offers from a luxury chateau, gites to basic hotels, farm B&B; and camping facilities. Restaurants are in plenty and the visitors can spend their time, hiking, cycling, horse riding, fishing, water surfing or simply visiting the countryside or the historical sites.

She was elected as a Scottish National Party (SNP) candidate in the 2015 Westminster general election but resigned the SNP whip after six months and sat as an independent until the end of the parliamentary session in May 2017. Prior to her election, McGarry was a SNP activist and convener of the party's Glasgow Regional Association. McGarry was a co-founder of the Women for Independence group. In November 2015, following allegations of financial misconduct, McGarry withdrew from the SNP party whip while the matter was investigated. In September 2016, McGarry was charged with a number of fraud offences relating to apparent discrepancies in the finances of the SNP Glasgow Regional Association and Women for Independence. On 24 April 2019 she pleaded guilty to two charges of embezzlement, and was subsequently jailed for eighteen months.  Early life and education Born and raised in Inverkeithing in Fife, McGarry was educated at St. Columba's R.C. High School, Dunfermline, before studying law at the University of Aberdeen, and worked as a policy adviser for a voluntary sector organisation.  Political career  At the SNP's annual conference in 2012, McGarry argued on the anti-NATO side of the NATO debate in the Scottish National Party, stating that opposition \\"is not merely about nuclear weapons\\" and calling for the SNP to retain its opposition to NATO membership. McGarry, a feminist, was among activists who set up Women for Independence in 2012. She told the Glasgow Herald the group was created \\"over a glass of wine\\" with former SSP MSP Carolyn Leckie as its main driving force. Explaining the decision, she said: \\"We came together because a group of us arrived at the conclusion, individually, that women's voices were missing from both sides of the referendum debate.\\" Already a well-known activist, McGarry's profile in the SNP increased when she was selected as the party's candidate for the 2014 Cowdenbeath by-election. She had previously sought selection as an SNP candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election, but failed. McGarry failed to win the by-election, gaining 5,704 votes (28.4%). A year later, she was selected to contest Glasgow East in the 2015 General Election. McGarry became the MP for the Glasgow East Constituency on 8 May 2015, taking the seat from former Labour MP Margaret Curran which was part of a historic election result that saw the SNP win 56 out of Scotland's 59 seats at Westminster. McGarry took the mandatory oath of allegiance to the monarch, despite having reservations. In January 2016, McGarry and author J. K. Rowling were involved in a Twitter spat. McGarry had accused the author of supporting an anonymous Twitter user with \\"misogynistic views\\". McGarry later deleted some tweets and Rowling accepted her apology. In March, McGarry became embroiled in another row after she claimed on Twitter that the organisation Scotland in Union was \\"headed by an internet troll and a outed holocaust denier\\". The organisation said that this was false and offensive. McGarry deleted her tweet and tweeted an apology. The matter was later settled out of court with McGarry issuing a formal apology and paying around £10,000 in damages. In February 2016, McGarry was briefly detained for questioning by Turkish security forces for using a mobile phone near a security checkpoint in south-eastern Turkey. She stated she was \\"recording the sound of bombs\\" falling on a nearby Kurdish area. She was not selected as the SNP candidate for her seat at the 2017 Westminster general election.  Embezzlement charges  In September 2015, Women for Independence alerted police after noticing discrepancies in its accounts, prompting an investigation into campaign funds, which was publicly reported for the first time in November 2015. It was alleged that McGarry, in her role as treasurer, transferred money raised during campaign events into her personal account and used cheques made out to the campaign to deposit money into her own account, embezzling a total of £32,991. She denied all wrongdoing. On 24 November, after the allegations surfaced, it was announced that McGarry had resigned the SNP whip and was automatically suspended from the party. She continued to sit as an independent MP.Natalie McGarry wears wedding dress for House of Commons vote, The Scotsman(10 June 2016). In September 2016, McGarry gave a voluntary interview with Police Scotland.Libby Brooks, Glasgow East MP Natalie McGarry charged with embezzlement, The Guardian (27 September 2016). Following this interview, McGarry was charged with a number of fraud offences, including embezzlement of funds, breach of trust and an offence under the Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013. It was alleged that between April 2014 and August 2015 she embezzled a total of £4,661 in her role as treasurer of the Scottish National Party's Glasgow Regional Association, and that between February 2014 and June the same year she embezzled £3,891 from funds raised for the Yes Glasgow campaign group. She was initially represented by solicitor Aamer Anwar, but subsequently changed representation.Paul Hutcheon, Natalie McGarry MP parts company with solicitor Aamer Anwar, The Herald (19 March 2017). McGarry appeared in private at Glasgow Sheriff Court on 21 March 2018. On 21 February 2019, she entered a plea of not guilty to three charges of embezzlement and one charge under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 in relation to failing to provide police with a passcode to a mobile phone seized from her. Her trial began at Glasgow Sheriff Court on 23 April 2019. On 24 April, she pleaded guilty to two charges of embezzlement including £21,000 from Women for Independence and £4,661 from SNP Glasgow regional association. The remaining charges were dropped. She was to be sentenced in May and the Crown intends to recover the money through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. On 1 May she attempted to withdraw her two guilty pleas, but the sheriff ruled that this was not possible. On 6 June she was jailed for eighteen months. However several days later she was released on bail pending an appeal. On 19 December her conviction was quashed, following submissions by her lawyer Gordon Jackson, and she was told that she would face a retrial.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- scotland-scotland-politics-50856660 BBC Scotland News website 19 December 2019 Personal life In May 2016, McGarry married David Meikle, a Conservative councillor on Glasgow City Council representing the Pollokshields ward. The couple had been together since 2011, and announced their engagement shortly after she was elected as an MP. They live in Shawlands, Glasgow. McGarry's mother, Alice McGarry, was the SNP parliamentary candidate for Dunfermline East in 1987 and has been a SNP councillor on Fife Council, representing Inverkeithing and Dalgety Bay since 1986. Her aunt is Tricia Marwick, former Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and SNP MSP. On 19 April 2017, McGarry fainted in the House of Commons. She later announced on Twitter that she was expecting a child and gave birth to a daughter later that year.

Background A Light Heavyweight Championship bout between the current champion Jon Jones and #1 contender Glover Teixeira was briefly linked as the event headliner. However, just days after the announcement, Dana White indicated that \\"the timing didn't work out\\" for the pairing and that fight would take place at a later event. The event was expected to be headlined by the long awaited return of the Bantamweight Champion Dominick Cruz. However, on January 6, UFC President Dana White announced that Cruz had torn his groin in training and pulled from the fight. Cruz had also vacated his title, making Renan Barão the undisputed bantamweight champion. Stepping up to replace Cruz was Urijah Faber, in a rematch of their interim title bout at UFC 149.

Fowler Result Thorne won the by-election by a majority of just eight votes from the Unionist candidate Leo Amery, who had lost to Fowler in 1906. Thorne One of reasons it was such a narrow margin was the policy of the Suffragists at this time to oppose the candidates of the Liberal government because they would not bring in a Bill to provide votes for women. This was despite the individual views of the candidates, many of whom, like Thorne, were pro- women’s suffrage.

Formylation with alkoxide and methyl formate leads to the 2-hydroxymethyl derivative. Reaction of this last with hydroxylamine leads to formation of an isoxazole ring. There is then obtained azastene.

It was the first known antiandrogen to be studied in humans. It is taken by mouth or by application to skin. Pharmacology=Pharmacodynamics= Benorterone is an antiandrogen, or an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In one study, the affinity of benorterone for the AR was found to be about 5-fold greater than that of cyproterone acetate in rat prostate cytosol; the Ki values were 0.7 nM for benorterone and 3.7 nM for cyproterone acetate, which were 243% and 46% of those of testosterone (Ki = 1.7 nM), respectively. However, another study found that benorterone had only 11% of the affinity of dihydrotestosterone for the androgen receptor. Although an antiandrogen, benorterone actually is a very weak partial agonist of the AR and has been reported to possess weak androgenic activity. The same is true for cyproterone acetate and other steroidal antiandrogens. Unlike certain other steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate, benorterone is not also a progestogen, instead being described as a selective and pure AR antagonist similarly to nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as flutamide and bicalutamide. However, although it is described as not being a progestogen, benorterone was found to produce \\"a highly variable decrease in plasma testosterone levels,\\" indicating that it has weak antigonadotropic effects. The reasons for this are unclear, as other pure antiandrogens such as cyproterone (not cyproterone acetate) and flutamide do not do this and instead produce consistent increases in testosterone levels. However, it is notable that the anabolic steroid methyltestosterone, which benorterone differs from in chemical structure only by the removal of a carbon atom in the B ring, is aromatized into the estrogen methylestradiol and has potent estrogenic activity. Estrogens are antigonadotropic similarly to androgens and progestogens and are likewise able to suppress testosterone levels. In accordance, the compound corresponding to what would be the aromatized form of benorterone, 17α-methyl-B-norestradiol, has been described and has been reported to possess estrogenic activity, although the aromatization of benorterone has not been assessed.Fare, L. R., Kerwin, J. F., & Kinney, R. W. (1968). U.S. Patent No. 3,377,361. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. https://patents.google.com/patent/US3377361A/en A couple of studies found that prothrombin levels decreased by 50% in some patients treated with benorterone, although a causal relationship between this change and benorterone could not be shown. =Pharmacokinetics= Benorterone is active orally and topically and has been studied by both of these routes of administration. Chemistry Benorterone, also known as 17α-methyl-B-nortestosterone or as 17α-methyl-B- norandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. Specifically, it is the C17α methyl and B-nor analogue of testosterone and the B-nor analogue of methyltestosterone. Other testosterone-derived steroidal antiandrogens include abiraterone acetate, BOMT, delanterone, dienogest, galeterone, metogest, mifepristone, oxendolone, rosterolone, topterone, trimethyltrienolone, and zanoterone, while progesterone-derived steroidal antiandrogens include examples like cyproterone and cyproterone acetate. History Benorterone was developed in the late 1950s, was first reported to possess antiandrogenic activity in 1964, and was investigated in clinical trials in the mid-to-late 1960s. It was the first known antiandrogen to be studied in humans. The drug was found to be effective in the treatment of acne, seborrhea, and hirsutism in women. In addition, unlike progestogenic antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate, it seldom produced side effects in women and did not affect menstruation. However, in males, benorterone was not effective for acne, and produced high rates of gynecomastia (in 12 out of 13 or 92% of young men treated with 75 to 300 mg/day benorterone). Shortly following the observance of this side effect, it was withdrawn from clinical studies. Subsequently, cyproterone acetate, which has a greatly reduced risk of gynecomastia by virtue of its concomitant progestogenic and antigonadotropic actions (which results in suppression of estrogen levels), was developed instead and was introduced for medical use in 1973. In addition, spironolactone, a steroidal antimineralocorticoid that was introduced for medical use in 1959, was discovered to possess potent antiandrogenic activity in 1969, and became widely used clinically as an antiandrogen after its first use in an androgen-dependent condition in 1978.

History  Jefferson Dollars for Scholars is a chapter of the Minnesota-based American philanthropic organization Scholarship America, an organization founded in 1958 by optometrist Dr. Irving A. Fradkin. He believed in the power of a dollar to make a difference in the lives of aspiring scholars without the means to pursue a college education. He envisioned people coming together in communities—each donating one dollar or more—to raise funds to award college scholarships. Armed with a grand idea and a workable plan, he reached out to his community, hoping that others believed in this potential as well. He received his first donation from Eleanor Roosevelt. To date, Dr. Fradkin's vision has led to the inception of 1100 chapters across the U.S,. including Jefferson Dollars for Scholars. Together, these chapters have raised over $3 billion and contributed to sending more than two million students to college. Jefferson Dollars for Scholars was founded in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana in 1993 by a group of local community leaders in order to make post-secondary education a priority and possibility for academically deserving students.  Recognition  Jefferson Dollars for Scholars received the Golden Tassel Award for Outstanding New Chapter in the country in 1996.

R. Hasenjaeger (June 1, 1919 – September 2, 2006) was a German mathematical logician. Independently and simultaneously with Leon Henkin in 1949, he developed a new proof of the completeness theorem of Kurt Gödel for predicate logic. He worked as an assistant to Heinrich Scholz at Section IVa of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht Chiffrierabteilung, and was responsible for the security of the Enigma machine. Personal life Gisbert Hasenjaeger went to high school in Mülheim, where his father was a lawyer and local politician. After completing school in 1936, Gisbert volunteered for labor service. He was drafted for military service in World War II, and fought as an artillerist in the Russian campaign, where he was badly wounded in January 1942. After his recovery, in October 1942 Heinrich ScholzHasenjaeger knew Scholz since his school days and corresponded with him during his time as a conscript. got him an employment in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW/Chi), where he was the youngest member at 24. He attended a cryptography training course by Erich Hüttenhain, and was put into the recently founded Section IVa \\"Security check of own Encoding Procedures\\" under Karl Stein, who assigned him the security check of the Enigma machine. Cited from German Wikipedia At the end of the war as OKW/Chi disintegrated, Hasenjaeger managed to escape TICOM, the United States effort to roundup and seize captured German intelligence people and material. From the end of 1945, he studied mathematics and especially mathematical logic with Heinrich Scholz at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität University in Münster. In 1950 received his doctorate Topological studies on the semantics and syntax of an extended predicate calculus and completed his habilitation in 1953. In Münster, he worked as an assistant to Scholz and later co-author, to write the textbook Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic in Springer's Grundlehren series (Yellow series of Springer-Verlag), which he published in 1961 fully 6 years after Scholz's death. In 1962 he became professor at the University of Bonn, where he was Director of the newly created Department of Logic. In 1962, Dr. Hasenjaeger left Münster University to take a full professorship at Bonn University, where he was established Director of the newly established Department of Logic and Basic Research. In 1964/65 he spent a year at Princeton University at the Institute for Advanced Study His doctoral students at Bonn included Ronald B. Jensen, his most famous pupil. He became professor emeritus in 1984. Work=Safety Testing the Enigma Machine= In Oct 1942, after starting work at OKW/Chi, Hasenjaeger was trained in cryptology, given by the mathematician, Erich Hüttenhain, who was widely considered the most important German cryptologist of his time. Hasenjaeger was put into a newly formed department, whose principal responsibility was the defensive testing and security control of their own methods and devices. Hasenjaeger was ordered, by the mathematician Karl Stein who was also conscripted at OKW/Chi, to examine the Enigma machine for cryptologic weaknesses, while Stein was to examine the Siemens and Halske T52 and the Lorenz SZ-42. The Enigma machine that Hasenjaeger examined was a variation that worked with 3 rotors and had no plug board. Germany sold this version to neutral countries to accrue foreign exchange. Hasenjaeger was presented with a 100 character encrypted message for analysis and found a weakness which enabled the identification of the correct wiring rotors and also the appropriate rotor positions, to decrypt the messages. Further success eluded him however. He crucially failed to identify the most important weakness of the Enigma machine: the lack of fixed points (letters encrypting to themselves) due to the reflector. Hasenjaeger could take some comfort from the fact that even Alan Turing missed this weakness. Instead the honour was attributed to Gordon Welchman, who used the knowledge to decrypt several hundred thousand Enigma messages during the war. In fact fixed points were earlier used by Polish codebreaker, Henryk Zygalski, as the basis for his method of attack on Enigma cipher, referred to by the Poles as \\"Zygalski sheets\\" (Zygalski sheets) (płachty Zygalskiego) and by the British as the \\"Netz method\\". =Proof of Gödel's completeness theorem= It was while Hasenjaeger was working at Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität University in Münster in the period between 1946 and 1953 that Hasenjaeger made a most amazing discovery - a proof of Kurt Gödel's Gödel's completeness theorem for full predicate logic with identity and function symbols. Gödel's proof of 1930 for predicate logic did not automatically establish a procedure for the general case. When he had solved the problem in late 1949, he was frustrated to find that a young American mathematician Leon Henkin, had also created a proof. Both construct from extension of a term model, which is then the model for the initial theory. Although the Henkin proof was considered by Hasenjaeger and his peers to more flexible, Hasenjaeger' is considered simpler and more transparent. Hasenjaeger continued to refine his proof through to 1953 when he made a breakthrough. According to the mathematicians Alfred Tarski, Stephen Cole Kleene and Andrzej Mostowski, the Arithmetical hierarchy of formulas is the set of arithmetical propositions that are true in the standard model, but not arithmetically definable. So, what does the concept of truth for the term model mean, the results for the recursively axiomatized Peano arithmetic from the Hasenjaeger method? The result was the truth predicate is well arithmetically, it is even \\\\Delta^0_2. So far down in the arithmetic hierarchy, and that goes for any recursively axiomatized (countable, consistent) theories. Even if you are true in all the natural numbers \\\\Pi^0_1 formulas to the axioms. This classic proof is a very early, original application of the arithmetic hierarchy theory to a general-logical problem. It appeared in 1953 in the Journal of Symbolic Logic. Gödel proof. Construction of Turing Machines In 1963, Hasenjaeger built a Universal Turing machine out of old telephone relays. Although Hasenjaeger's work on UTMs was largely unknown and he never published any details of the machinery during his lifetime, his family decided to donate the machine to the Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Paderborn, Germany, after his death. In an academic paper presented at the International Conference of History and Philosophy of Computinghttp://www.computing-conference.ugent.be/ Rainer Glaschick, Turlough Neary, Damien Woods, Niall Murphy had examined Hasenjaeger's UTM machine at the request of Hasenjaeger family and found that the UTM was remarkably small and efficiently universal. Hasenjaeger UTM contained 3-tapes, 4 states, 2 symbols and was an evolution of ideas from Edward F. Moore's first universal machine and Hao Wang's B-machine. Hasenjaeger went on to build a small efficient Wang B-machine simulator. This was again proven by the team assembled by Rainer Glaschick to be efficiently universal. =Comments on the Enigma Machine weakness= It was only in the 1970s that Hasenjaeger learned that the Enigma Machine had been so comprehensively broken. It impressed him that Alan Turing himself, considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, had worked on breaking the device. The fact that the Germans had so comprehensively underestimated the weaknesses of the device, in contrast to Turing and Welchmans work, was seen by Hasenjaeger today as entirely positive. Hasenjaeger stated: :Would it not been so, then the war would have lasted probably longer and the first atomic bomb had not fallen on Japan, but on Germany.

However, this use is controversial due to concerns about its clinical efficacy. Oxendolone is not effective by mouth and must be given by injection into muscle. Oxendolone is an antiandrogen, and hence is an antagonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. It is also a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. Due to its progestogenic activity, oxendolone has antigonadotropic effects. Oxendolone has no other important hormonal activity. Oxendolone was introduced for medical use in 1981. It is used only in Japan. Medical uses Oxendolone is used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in Japan. It has been used at a dosage of 200 mg once every 2 weeks via intramuscular injection. Although it is approved for the treatment of BPH in Japan, concerns have been raised about its use for this condition due to poor efficacy seen in clinical trials. Side effectsPharmacology=Pharmacodynamics= Oxendolone binds to the androgen receptor (Ki = 320 nM) and progesterone receptor (Ki = 20 nM) and acts as a weak but clinically relevant inhibitor of 5α-reductase ( = 1.4 μM). The relative binding affinity of oxendolone for the androgen receptor is 0.8 to 3.6% of that of metribolone. Oxendolone is not a silent antagonist of the androgen receptor but is rather predominantly antagonistic with weak agonistic activity; for this reason, it has been described as a selective androgen receptor modulator. The medication has potent antigonadotropic effects via its progestogenic activity. It has been found to suppress luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels to an equivalent extent as allylestrenol and chlormadinone acetate, which are two progestins that are similarly used at high doses to treat BPH. =Pharmacokinetics= The oral bioavailability of oxendolone in dogs is extremely low, 1% at most. Due to its low oral bioavailability, oxendolone is administered by intramuscular injection in humans. Its elimination half-life via this route is 5.0 to 6.6 days. Chemistry Oxendolone, also known as 16β-ethyl-19-nortestosterone or 16β-ethylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone and 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone). The acetate ester of oxendolone is known as TSAA-328, while the caproate ester of oxendolone is known as TSAA-330. They were never marketed. History Oxendolone has been marketed in Japan by Takeda since 1981. Society and culture=Generic names= Oxendolone is the generic name of the drug and its , , and .https://www.drugs.com/international/oxendolone.html It is also known by its developmental code name TSAA-291. =Brand names= Oxendolone is or has been sold under the brand names Prostetin and Roxenone. =Availability= Oxendolone is marketed only in Japan.
