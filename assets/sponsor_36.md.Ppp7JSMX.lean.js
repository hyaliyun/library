Description The hairy dragonfly is named for its hairy thorax, distinguishing it from other hawkers. It has a long, narrow pterostigma (the coloured, sclerotized patch on the outer region of each wing). The antehumeral stripes are usually thin and green. The hairy dragonfly has coupled, oval-shaped markings on its abdomen, blue on males and yellow on females. It is smaller than other species in the genus Aeshna. It is the United Kingdom's smallest hawker.. Habitat The hairy dragonfly lives in ponds, lakes, fens, ditches, and canals rich in vegetation. Some plants that grow there include the common club rush, common reed, great fen sedge, and true bulrush. This dragonfly requires open and sunny areas with dense vegetation for protection. Here they are able to feed on flying insects, shelter, and grow sexually mature. Although it is a common species, it is susceptible to uncongenial ditch management and poor water conditions. This is the reason the species disappeared for a few years, only to return recently. More so then its other relatives, the hairy dragonfly will only fly in sunshine and will hastily retreat if the sun happens to go in. Food and feeding habitats Like typical hawkers, the hairy dragonfly preys in mid-air on flying insects. It then carries its food to a suitable perch where it is able to eat and digest. Life stages The hairy dragonfly's flight period is short and early, beginning in mid-May and ending in mid-July. Dead vegetation and living stems growing in the water, close to the water's edge, provide a home for the eggs. Two years later, larvae emerge by scaling plant stems just above the surface of the water or possibly crawling inland for about a meter where they have room to spread their wings.

It is Aarne-Thompson type 327 C, the devil (witch) carries the hero home in a sack. Buttercup is so named because he is \\"plump and fat, and fond of good things\\". Synopsis While Buttercup's mother was baking, the dog began to bark and Buttercup saw an evil witch coming. His mother had him hide under the kneading trough, but the witch said she had a silver knife to give him and this lured him out. The witch told him that he had to climb into her sack to get it and, as soon as he was in, she carried him off. On the way, the witch asked \\"How far is it to Snoring?\\" and Buttercup said half a mile, so she rested and, using the knife, he escaped, putting a big fir root in the sack. The next day, the witch lured him out again with the offer of a silver spoon, but he escaped in the same way, using a stone. The third day, she offered him a silver fork and went straight home without resting. She gave him to her daughter to kill. The witch's daughter did not know how to do it. Buttercup told her to lay her head on the chopping block, and he would show her. He cut her head off with an axe, put it in her bed, and stewed her body. Then he climbed up the chimney with the root and stone. The witch and her husband, thinking their daughter asleep, ate the soup. Buttercup spoke to them of \\"daughter broth\\" from the chimney. They went outside to see what caused the noise, and Buttercup killed them by dropping the stone and root on their heads. He took all their gold and silver and went home.

The award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Biography Guillot was born at his parents' home in Courcoury in the Charente-Maritime department. After studying science, he moved to Senegal to work as a teacher, spending over 20 years in Africa. Most of the material for his many books comes from this time. His books include Kpo the Leopard, The King of Cats, Sirga: Queen of the African Bush, and Oworo. Kpo the Leopard was published in 1955 and was also included in The Hamish Hamilton Book of Wise Animals, edited by Eilis Dillon, illustrated by Bernard Brett (Hamish Hamilton, London, 1975. ), together with pieces featuring \\"fabulous animals\\" such as Edgar Allan Poe's Raven, E. Nesbit's Psammead, T. S. Eliot's Mr. Mistoffelees, and Rollicum Bitem the Fox from The Midnight Folk by John Masefield. The 397th White Elephant was named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list in 1958.

He combined his role as player-secretary- manager with his full-time job as a reporter for the Liverpool Mercury. He became secretary of Bolton Wanderers in 1896 and remained there for two years before moving to London to join Tottenham Hotspur as their first manager. He then accepted a more lucrative offer to join Portsmouth and guided them to a second-place finish in their first season in the Southern League. He accepted an offer to join Plymouth Argyle in 1903 and helped establish the club in the professional game. The job was to be his last as a manager and he retired from football altogether a year later. Football career Brettell began his football career with a local club St. Domingo. He initially played as centre- or inside-forward for the club, and later due to injuries as half-back and even on goal. He combined his playing duties with a role as secretary-manager of the team in 1875.Frank Brettell Greens on Screen. Retrieved 25 February 2010.

His first season in charge was also Portsmouth's first in the Southern League and adapted to their new surroundings well, finishing fourth in the league table. He left the club in June 1901 by \\"mutual agreement\\"; according to Football Chat \\"a detailed explanation [would serve] no good purpose\\". \\"Let it suffice that the directors could not agree with him on certain rather important matters, and a mutual agreement was arrived at by which he consented to resign\\".

It is about west from Coimbatore city. The place derives its name from the Thirumuruganatheeswar Temple present in the town. History The name of the village is derived from the famous Murugan temple located here. In the last 8 years the development of Tirupur had reached Thirumuruganpoondi and soon this village will be submerged under the broader name of Tirupur. The temple dates back to 9th Century. The origin of the temple is rooted in legendary antiquity. Soorapadma, the scourge of the gods with his retinue of demons, struck terror in the celestial world with his sudden depredations and campaigns. The persecuted gods approached Lord Siva and implored him to save their lives. Lord Siva sent Lord Subramanya with a huge army headed by the valiant Veerabhahu to destroy Soorapadma and his retinue. Lord Muruga accomplished the arduous task. But he was afflicted with the mortal sin of mass killing. In order to absolve himself he installed a Siva Linga in Thirumuruganpoondi and worshipped it. As Muruga himself adored Lord Siva, the latter assumed the appellation \\"Thirumuruganathaswamy\\" which means \\"Master of Muruga\\". The holy shrine is also associated with Sundaramurthynayanar one of. the most celebrated saints of saivism. He did a pilgrimage to the holy shrines opf Siva in Kongunadu. Now Siva, The Lord of Thirumuruganpoondi who wanted to hear the saints melodies, compositions way laid Sundaramurthynayanar, in the guise of a hunter and robbed him of all his belongings and disappeared into the temple, Sundaramurthynayanar's sorrow burst out in the form of soul full song expressing his anguish and chiding the Lord of Thirmuruganpoondi that his divine presence in such a notorious place was mere mockery. Pleased with the poignancy of the compositions the lord ordered the return of all his belongings. Having understood the divine purpose behind the prank, Sundarar leaped with joy and glorified the Lord in ten songs. This episode is celebrated as an important festival called \\"Vedupari\\". The great sages such as Agasthya, Markendeya and Dhurvasa took to severe austerities and worshiped the Lord enshrined here. It is said that Durvasa brought the \\"Madhavi tree\\" from heaven and placed it here. The Amman in this temple named as \\"Muyangupoon Mulaiyammai\\". Lord Muruga worshipped Siva Linga which was installed by him ad he did not pray to Amman. So amman got angry and she didn't come to the place. Lord Siva was not able to be there without Amman so he created a flood behind the statue and Siva Linga was about to be destroyed by the flood. Parvathi was not about to see that and she came down and hugged the Siva Linga to save it. So Lord siva was too happy. As parvathi hugged him he was happy so the amman named as \\"Muyangupoon Mulaiyammai\\". Geography The village is about 7 km from Tirupur city and about 4 km from the Avinashi.

Similar to \\"legal terminology\\" and related to \\"political terminology\\", military terms are known for an oblique tendency to incorporate technical language.

It is the headquarters of North Salmara sub-division. It is surrounded by natural forests and hills, and is located on the National Highway 31, about 200 km west of Guwahati. Its nearest airport is at Guwahati. Abhayapuri Railway Station is managed by the North East Frontier Railways. History Abhayapuri was the third capital (after 1897) of the ancient Bijni Kingdom that was established by the king, Bijit Narayan alias Chandra Narayan in 1671. Bijit Narayan was the son of Parikshit Narayan who was the grandson of Sukladhwaj alias Chilarai, the Koch general and the younger brother of Nara Narayan, the emperor of Kamata Kingdom in the 16th century. The first capital of Bijni Kingdom was located at modern Bijni town (1671‚Äì1864), but the capital was later shifted to Dumuria (now known as Dalan Bhanga) due to an attack by Jhawlia Mech and (a local chief under Bhutan Kingdom). An earthquake occurred at 5 PM on 12 June 1897 (1897 Assam earthquake) badly damaging the royal palaces of Dumuriya. Queen Abhayeswari Devi, the widow and second queen of Raja Kumud Narayan Bhup Bahadur, was the ruler of Bijni at that time. It was decided to shift the capital again to the Deohati forest area which was later named as Abhayapuri after Devi Abhoyamata, the family deity of the ruling dynasty. Later, during the rule of the last king, Raja Bhairabendra Narayan, the Government of India took over this kingdom in 1956. =Bijni Kingdom= The Bijni Kingdom was situated between 250 53' and 260 32' N. and 900 85' and 910 85' E. The estate was in possession of the Bijni family, descended from the Koch king Nara Narayan, who reigned over Kamata kingdom from 1534 to 1584. Before his death, Nara Narayana allowed his kingdom to be divided between his son Lakshmi Narayan and his nephew Raghu Rai (son of Chilarai). Raghu Rai established his capital at Barnagar in the Barpeta (now a district in Assam), and received as his share the Koch territories lying to the east of Sankosh River. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghu Rai declared independence. The eastern kingdom ruled by Raghu Rai came to be called Koch Hajo and the western Koch Bihar. Soon after the declaration of independence, the two kingdoms started displaying hostilities against each other. Raghu Rai was succeeded by his son Parikshit Narayan and was defeated in 1602 by the army of Nawab of Dhaka (governor for the Mughals) who was moved by Lakshmi Narayan (ruler of Koch Bihar). Parikshit was defeated at Dhubri (now a district in Assam) and sued for peace. But soon, he continued with the hostilities and in 1614 was driven up to Pandu, now in Guwahati. There, Parikshit surrendered and agreed to become a vassal of the Mughal Empire. But before he could take up this assignment he died. The Mughals then appointed Kabisekhar as the kanungo and instructed Sheikh Ibrahim Karori to set up a Mughal system of administration. Parikshit' son Bijit Narayan, was confirmed by the Mughals as 'jamindar' of the area between the river Manas and the Sankosh, and from him the Bijni family descended. The name \\"Bijni\\", now a sub- division of Chirang district of Bodoland Territorial Area in Assam, comes from the name of the king Bijit Narayan. Under the Mughal rule, the Bijni king Bijit Narayan paid a tribute of Rs. 5,998 which was afterward commuted to an annual delivery of 68 elephants. During the last two decades of the 17th century, the Mughals lost their influence on Assam while the East India Company gradually started strengthening their foothold in different parts of India including Bengal. The East India Company was awarded the 'diwani' or overlordship of Bengal by the empire following the Battle of Buxar in 1764 and the company came to an agreement (known as Permanent Settlement) with Bengali landlords in 1793 to fix revenues to be raised from land. With the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, the East India Company finally took control of the both Eastern Assam and Western Assam. However, it was doubtful whether Goalpara was ever included in the Permanent Settlement. According to The Imperial Gazetteer of India (Volume 8), a small assessment from the Bijni kingdom was always accepted in lieu of land revenue, though it has sometimes been argued it was nothing more than a tribute. The Imperial Gazetteer of India, which was published in 1902, states that the Bijni family paid a revenue of Rs. 1,500 and cesses amounting to nearly Rs. 19,000 for an estate which covered an area of with an estimated rent-roll of Rs. 2 lakh. On the conclusion of the Bhutan war (or Duar War) fought between British India and Bhutan in 1864‚Äì1865, the Bijni family put forward claims to hold a large tract of land in the Eastern Duir which they alleged that they were in possession under the Bhutan government. The claim was admitted and in 1870 a settlement was effected with the Court of Wards on behalf of the minor Bijni Raja. The present extent of the estate to which they were entitled was still matter of uncertainty, but in 1882 it was ruled by the government of India that the Raja should receive of land. These estates generally remained under the direct management of the government, who allowed to the Raja 7.5 percent of the collections as his share of profits. ;Rulers of Ancient Abhayapuri (Bijni Kingdom) * Bijit Narayan (alias Chandra Narayan) * Joy Narayan * Shiv Narayan * Bijoy Narayan * Mukunda Narayan * Haridev Narayan * Indra Narayan * Amrit Narayan * Kumud Narayan * Abhayeswari Devi * Jogendra Narayan * Bhairabendra Narayan ;Archaeological Monuments Ram Rajar Garh near Deohati village is a man-made historical pond which was excavated by Ramsingh I of Ambar Kingdom of Rajasthan.

The historical authenticity of the images are yet to be ascertained. Based on the study of the stone carvings and modes related to the carved idols, some archaeologists has opined that the temple and images belong to 8th to 10th centuries AD. The existence of ruins in Lalmati-Durgamari area along with temples was brought to the notice of the Historical & Antiquarian Department of the Govt. of Assam in 1974. The department undertook excavation work which resulted the discovery of the temples, images and idols of gods and goddesses. The Lungai Pahar Shiva Temple is located 10 km away from the main town of Abhayapuri. There are 227 steps on the stairway to the temple. Inside which there are stone carvings of Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha and Goddess Kali. Rajbari, Abhayapuri is the palace of the erstwhile king of Abhayapuri Kingdom. People and culture Since time immemorial, Koch-Rajbonshies (belong to Indo-Mongoloid ethnic group of people) have been living in this area now known as Abhayapuri. These people are the original sons of the soil and their existence can be traced back to the \\"Kiratees\\" of pre-vedic epic age (Mahabharata). These Kiratas of dim past are also mentioned in Kalika-Purana and Yogini Tantra and also in histories written both by native and foreign scholars. Yogis, Kalitas, Kayasthas and older Muslims are also indigenous who settled in this part of land prior to the advent of Britishers in North East Region. Some of them settled in the area centuries before the advent of Britishers. Much later, people from various parts of Assam migrated to Abhayapuri. Major festivals such as Diwali, Holi, Durga Puja, Swaraswati Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Kalipuja, and Shivaratri are celebrated by the Hindus of Ahbayapuri. Those of Islamic faith celebrate Idd and Muharram. Besides the religious festivals, Bihu, the agricultural festival of Assam is celebrated by all Assamese, irrespective of caste, creed or religion. The 44th conference of the Asam Sahitya Sabha was held in Abhayapuri in 1977 under the presidency of Syed Abdul Malik, a big name in the history of modern Assamese literature. The area where the conference was held is still known as Sahitya Sabha Path (Road). Demographics India census, Abhayapuri had a population of 14,671. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Abhayapuri has an average literacy rate of 79%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 55% of the males and 45% of females literate. 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. According to the census of 2011, the town has a population of 15,847 (Area: 4.74 km2 ‚Äì Density: 3,343.2 inhabitants/km2) that shows an increase of 0.77%. In the last few years, population of Abhayapuri has increased surprisingly with a large number migrating government workers starting to reside permanently in the town. In addition, people migrating from nearby villages also catapulted the population. This burst in population, combined with lack of development in public infrastructural facilities, has started playing spoilsport on the once- remarkably-peaceful small town in recent years. Also, the increasing number of private and public vehicles, especially small passenger carriers like 'tempos' and vans, and motorcycles has raised serious concern about road traffic safety.

The term, coming from French, itself from Late Latin gyrovagus (gyro-, \\"circle\\" and vagus, \\"wandering\\"), is used to refer to a kind of monk, rather than a specific order, and may be pejorative as they are almost universally denounced by Christian writers of the Early Middle Ages. The Council of Chalcedon (451) and Second Council of Nicaea (787) prohibit this practice. The \\"gyrovagi\\" were denounced as wretched by Benedict of Nursia, who accused them of indulging their passions and cravings. Augustine called them Circumcelliones (circum cellas = those who prowl around the barns) and attributed the selling of fake relics as their innovation. Cassian also mentions a class of monk, which may have been identical, who were reputed to be gluttons who refused to fast at the proper times. Up until the time of Benedict, several attempts had been made by various synods at suppressing and disciplining monks who refused to settle in a cloister. With the establishment of the Rule of St. Benedict in the 8th century, the cenobitic and eremitic forms of monasticism became the accepted form of monasticism within the Christian Church, and the wandering monk phenomenon faded into obscurity. Legacy As with the term Sarabaites, after the eighth century the term Gyrovagi was sometimes used pejoratively to refer to degenerate monks within a monastery, or to travelling salesmen. In the early 13th century, some of the first Friars Preachers of the Dominican order were dismissed as gyrovagues and their active preaching dismissed as beneath the dignity of the serious religious who lived in monasteries.Murray, Paul.

It is the second most populous city in Amravati District after Amravati and seventh most populous city in Vidarbha. Achalpur camp is known as Paratwada. History Achalpur was the earliest capital of a branch of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which emerged sometime in the 8th century. It was the site of a battle between the Rashtrakutas and the Kalchuris in the 9th century. Achalpur or Ellichpur is first mentioned authentically in the 13th century as one of the famous cities of the Deccan. Though tributary to the Delhi Sultanate after 1294, it remained under Hindu administration till 1318, when it came directly under the Muslim Delhi Sultanate. In 1347 Achalpur with the Berar region was ruled by the Bahmani Sultanate. In 1490 Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk proclaimed his independence and founded the Imad Shahi dynasty of the Berar Sultanate. He proceeded to annex Mahur to his new kingdom and established his capital at Ellichpur. It was afterwards capital of the Berar Subah at intervals until the Mughal occupation, when the seat of the provincial governor was moved to Balapur. The town retains many relics of the Sultans of Berar. As the Mughal empire deteriorated in the 18th century, Achalpur along with the rest of Berar came under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1853, Berar Province came under British administration, although it remained formally part of the Hyderabad state until 1903 when the province became the Berar Division of the Central Provinces. Achalpur, known by the British as Ellichpur, became part of East Berar, with Amraoti (Amravati) as capital of the division. In 1867 East Berar was split into the districts of Amraoti and Ellichpur district, with Ellichpur as the headquarters of Ellichpur District. The district had an area of . In 1901 Achalpur had a population of 29,740, with ginning factories and a considerable trade in cotton and forest produce. It was connected by good roads with Amraoti and Chikhaldara. Berar was annexed to British India in 1903 and merged with the Central Provinces, and in 1905 Ellichpur District was merged into Amraoti District. The civil station of Paratwada, 5 km. from the town of Ellichpur, contained the principal public buildings at the beginning of the 20th century. After India's independence in 1947, the Central Provinces became the province, and after 1950 the state, Madhya Pradesh. The 1956 States Reorganisation Act redrew the boundaries of India's states along linguistic lines, and the predominantly Marathi-speaking Amravati District was transferred to Bombay State, which was renamed Maharashtra in 1960 when it was split from Gujarat...? Geography Achalpur and Paratwada are twin cities located in the lap of Satpuda . It has an average elevation of 369 metres (1210 ft). These twin cities are surrounded by rivers named Sapan and Bicchhan, the tributaries of Chandrabhaga river. There is hilly area that acts like a fence to this city. This city is at the boundary of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Even Madhya Pradesh is so close to this city that travelling of (about) 12 km changes the state region.

The FCC established the fund in 1997 in compliance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The FCC is a government agency that implements and enforces America's communication regulations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. territories. The Universal Service Fund's budget ranges from $5‚Äì8 billion per year depending on the needs of the telecommunications providers. These needs include the cost to maintain the hardware needed for their services and the services themselves. The total 2019 proposed budget for the USF was $8.4 billion. The budget is revised Quarterly allowing the service providers to accurately estimate their costs. As of 2019, roughly 60% of the USF budget was put towards ‚Äúhigh-cost‚Äù areas, 19% went to libraries and schools, 13% was for low income areas, and 8% was for rural health care. In 2019 the rate for the USF budget was 24.4% of a telecom company's interstate and international end-user revenues. While separate itemization is not required by the FCC, it is common for USF fees to be listed separately from other charges on a consumer's bill. Universal Service charges should not be confused with what are sometimes referred to in telephone company bills as \\"Federal Subscriber Line\\" charges, which are access fees charged by telecommunications companies, not the local or federal government. Some have raised concerns about the future funding of the USF; despite falling taxable revenues, the size of the fund has increased from $1.2 billion in collections at 5.7% in 4Q 2000, to $2.2 billion in 4Q 2014 at 16.1%. Some believe that reclassifying broadband Internet access services under Title II of the 1996 Telecommunications Act would be followed by requiring ISPs to pay into the USF as a new source of revenue for the fund. But the FCC has made clear that it will not require contributions on broadband Internet access revenues at this time, as the FCC will forbear from the contribution requirements in Section 254(d) of the Communications Act. History =Calls for universal service= By 1913, AT&T; had favored status from U.S. government, allowing it to operate in a noncompetitive economic environment in exchange for subjection to price and quality service regulation. The government asserted that a monopolistic telephone industry would best serve the goal of creating a \\"universal\\" network with compatible technology country- wide for telephone consumers. Regulators emphasized limits on profits, enforcing \\"reasonable\\" prices for service, setting levels of depreciation and investment for new technology and equipment, dependability and \\"universality\\" of service. \\"Universal\\" was originally used by AT&T; to mean, \\"interconnection to other networks, not service to all customers\\". After years of regulation, the term came to include infrastructural development of telephony and service to everyone at a reasonable price.Aufderheide, P., & United States. (1999). Communications policy and the public interest. New York: Guilford Press. = Willis Graham Act of 1921 = The Willis Graham Act of 1921 was called into action in order to resolve pressing issues in the debate about the merits of interconnectivity of telecommunication. The act marks the first piece of legislation in the history of telecommunication to tackle the increasingly difficult challenges of the telecommunication industry in the 20th century. Before the Graham act was passed the commonly expressed opinion was, such as by the Senate Commerce Committee, that telephone service fitted the definition of a natural monopoly. The central practical problem, according to the committee, with the Willis Graham Act was competing telecommunication services serving one individual market. The act was in favor of a monopoly, which aimed to exempt competing telephone companies from the antitrust laws and allow them to unify the service by merging competing telecommunication service providers. The main principle behind the act was that there should be only one system in each community through which all users communicate. The focus was exclusively on local service rather than long-distance service, as no independent long- distance lines were able to compete with AT&T.; =Communications Act of 1934= The Communications Act of 1934 includes in its preamble a reference to universal service. It calls for \\"rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges\\" to \\"all the people of the United States.\\" Communications Act of 1934 ‚Äì Title I, Sec. 1 [47 U.S.C. 151] The Communications Act of 1934 first established the concept of making affordable basic telephone service available to everyone everywhere within a nation, state, or other governmental jurisdiction. To comply with the act, AT&T; began increasing the price of long-distance service to pay for universal service. The act also established the FCC to oversee all non-governmental broadcasting, interstate communications, as well as international communication which originate or terminate in the United States. Before the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund (USF) operated as a mechanism by which interstate long- distance carriers were assessed to subsidize telephone service to low-income households and high-cost areas in order to ensure that all the people in the United States have access to rapid, efficient, nationwide communications service with sufficient facilities at realistic charges.Communication Act of 1934. (1934). Amended by the Telecommunication Act of 1996. Retrieved July 18, 2009 from http://www.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf = Ozark Plan = In the 1960s the telecommunication monopolies were shocked by new evolving technologies and competitions: new long-distance carriers and microwave networks were authorized. The predominant method used for financing subsidies for the underprivileged was to reallocate profit margins made by long-distance telecommunication to funds for local telephone connection. This process began in the mid 1960 and was institutionalized through the Ozark plan of 1970 into action. At the time of the institutionalization telephone penetration ranged between 85‚Äì95%. =Era of deregulation= There was a push for deregulating the telecommunications industry in the 1980s. Under President Ronald Reagan, the FCC shifted its focus from \\"social equity to an economic efficiency objective,\\" which it claimed was a primary purpose of the Communications Act of 1934. After AT&T; was split up in 1984, universal service was still \\"supported by a system of above-cost access charges paid to local exchange companies.\\" This system was administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Increased competition and universal service were later legislatively addressed and codified with the Telecommunications Act of 1996.Jayakar, K. (2009). Universal Service. In Schejter, A. (2009). And communications for all: A policy agenda for a new administration. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books. =Telecommunications Act of 1996= The Universal Service Fund was first codified in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the first major rewrite of the Communications Act of 1934. The act addresses new challenges and opportunities of the digital information age, with the goal of promoting an economic environment conducive for the growth of new information technology. It also further developed the meaning and implementation of universal service. The act calls for the creation of a joint federal-state board to make recommendations to the FCC on defining federal universal services and set time tables. The act also set out immediate priorities of universal service. These include quality and reasonably priced services, access to advanced telecommunication services, access for rural, low-income and high-cost regions, equitable and nondiscriminatory service, specific and predictable price structure, access of advanced telecommunication services for schools and health care and libraries (Sec. 254(b)(1)-(7)). The act provided ability in the constantly changing telecommunication environment to periodically revisit and adjust universal service, while setting core principles (Sec. 254(c)). The 1996 act also \\"mandated the creation of the universal service fund (USF) into which all telecommunications providers are required to contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end- user telecommunications revenues\\". The major goals of Universal Service as mandated by the 1996 Act are as follows: The 1996 Act states that all providers of telecommunications services should contribute to federal universal service in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner; there should be specific, predictable, and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service; all schools, classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should, generally, have access to advanced telecommunications services; and finally, that the Federal-State Joint Board and the FCC should determine those other principles that, consistent with the 1996 Act, are necessary to protect the public interest.Federal Communications Commission. (2009). Universal Service section. Retrieved July 16, 2009 from http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/universal_service/ =Expansion of the fund into broadband= The concept of universal service may include other telecommunications-information services, mainly Internet access. Members of Congress have spoken out in favor of increased contribution to the USF from alternate sources. Many of the services covered by the USF are related to traditional telephone technology. There is a rising concern that more recent developments in telecommunications are just as important to the consumer as these older technologies. For example, consumers' subscriptions to traditional telephone services have fallen while their subscription rate to wireless services have been rising consistently. Yet many cellular companies are likely to receive less funding under the new rules, which may reduce consumers' access to wireless services in areas of the country that have low populations. Similarly, a question currently debated is whether access to broadband internet should be supported by the USF and if so, how best to fulfill such a large mandate without damaging the stability of the fund. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states that \\"advanced services\\" should be accessible to all Americans [Section 254(b)(3)]. One question is whether the providers of internet access should contribute to the fund like other companies that provide access to telecommunications, if such providers also want to draw from the fund. Supporters of including internet access in the Universal Service Fund include former Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA)Subcommittee on Communication, Technology and the Internet. Statement of Congressman Rick Boucher, USF: Reforming the High Cost Funds. (2009, March 12) Retrieved July 17, 2009, from http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090312/boucher_open.pdf Adding additional services to the fund has corporate support from major telecommunication companies, including Verizon and AT&T.; In March 2009, senior executives from Verizon Communications met with the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, providing recommendations for how best to proceed bringing broadband and mobile communication access to rural and unserved areas. Citing reform to the Universal Service Fund as a means \\"to better serve rural America,\\" Verizon recommended that a limit be set on the size of USF's high-cost fund, competitive bidding wars be employed to determine which company expand service to unserved areas, structure a \\"wire- center approach\\" model to replace statewide cost averaging, restructure how contributions to the USF are determined, and impose a deadline on the FCC for completion of their reform of inter-carrier compensation. In October 2011 the FCC formally proposed a \\"Connect America Fund\\" to address these and other concerns.details Universal Service Fund switch to broadband Electronista, Oct 9, 2011. Reform finally arrived on October 27, 2011, when the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition money from the Universal Service Fund to a new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund that will support the expansion of broadband services to areas that don't have broadband access yet. In June, 2015, the FCC announced steps to modernize and reform Lifeline for broadband. Public comments were sought, with a deadline of August 31, 2015. The collection of public comments are available here. The NDIA played a critical role in providing comments and encouraging others to participate in the process. On April 1, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission voted to expand the Lifeline telephone subsidy for low-income Americans to include Internet access. On April 27, 2016, the full text of the ruling was released. The key points of the decision include: * Establishes a National Eligibility Verifier to verify eligible Lifeline subscribers. Eligibility will be based on participation in SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, Federal Public Housing Assistance, the Veterans *Pension benefit program, current Tribal qualifying programs, or those who can demonstrate income of less than 135 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. * Defines minimum service standards for broadband and mobile voice services. * Defines a five and half year transition plan to migrate from voice-focus to broadband-service-focus. * Creates a Lifeline Broadband Subscriber designation process to encourage new service providers. * Requires that Lifeline providers make available hotspot- enabled devices and Wi-Fi enabled devices when providing such devices for use with the Lifeline-supported service. * Directs the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB) to develop recommendations to address the non-price barriers to digital inclusion. In addition, CGB's plan should address best practices for increasing the digital skills of those already online and how those best practices can be spread throughout the digital inclusion community. Components USF's money is funded and then spent amongst the fund's four programs. The Connect America Fund provides funding for telephone companies that provide services to high-cost areas. The Low-Income Support \\"assists low- income customers by helping to pay for monthly telephone charges so that telephone service is more affordable.\\" The E-Rate program \\"provides telecommunication services (e.g., local and long-distance calling, both fixed and mobile, high-speed data transmission lines), Internet access, and internal connections to eligible schools and libraries.\\" Lastly, the Rural Health Care Support program \\"provides funding to eligible health care providers (HCPs) for telecommunications and broadband services necessary for the provision of health care.\\" As far as State funds go, they have experienced inhibited growth. \\"The growth of State USF funds was tempered by reductions in Lifeline support and IAS funding, both driven by changes in federal regulation.\\" There currently are forty-five states that provide some sort of State universal service support in addition to the existing federal funds. There are six states, however, that do not have any state funds. These include Alabama, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Universal Service Fund as made up of the following four constituent programs: =Connect America Fund= The largest and most complex of the four programs, the high cost program subsidizes telecommunications services in rural and remote areas. The program paid out $4.2 billion in subsidies to telecommunications companies in 2013, with a goal of making telecommunications affordable to rural and remote areas. The program has been criticized as wasteful, granting large sums of money to telecommunications companies while having little effect on access. As part of the National Broadband Plan proposed in March 2010, the FCC proposed reorganizing the High Cost program into a new \\"Connect America Fund\\", which will include both voice and 4 Mbit/s internet connectivity. On October 27, 2011, the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition the money from the Universal Service Fund High-Cost Program into the new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund, effectively putting an end to the USF High-Cost Fund by 2018. In 2012, during \\"Phase I\\" of the Connect America Fund, $115 million in subsidies were given out to build out broadband in 37 states, with $71.9 million going to Frontier Communications and $35 million to Century Link, with AT&T; and Verizon declining to participate. In 2013, also during \\"Phase I\\", CenturyLink accepted another $54 million, and AT&T; accepted $100 million. In March 2014, the FCC approved \\"Phase II\\" of the transition to the Connect America Fund, adding $1.8 billion a year in funding, and clarifying the specifics of the funding process. Under the framework the FCC approved, incumbent carriers have priority access to subsidies, but if the funds are declined, the funds are allocated by a competitive bidding process. The FCC also proposed upping the minimum speed requirement from 4Mbit/s to 10Mbit/s. In May 2014, the 10th circuit court of appeals upheld the shift in funds in the face of a legal challenge by telephone companies. The Connect America Fund also includes the Mobility Fund, which is given to wireless carriers who expand service to underserved areas. \\"Phase I\\" of the Mobility Fund offered $300 million for a September 2012 round of auctions, and \\"Phase II\\" of the Mobility Fund plans to give out $500 million in annual support. =Low income (Lifeline)= Since 1985, the Lifeline program has helped low-income people pay for phone service; first landlines, then cellphones, and as of 2016 it also offers the option of Internet connectivity. It provides a subsidy of up to $10.00 a month for Americans below 135% of the poverty line for this service. As of 2012, 17 million households received a $9.25 subsidized discount through the program. This was down to 12 million households by 2015. In 2013, the Lifeline program paid out $1.8 billion in subsidies to telephone companies; reduced to $1.5 billion by 2015. As the original program was set up to cover land lines, there was criticism of the increasing use of the fund to cover wireless service, as well as significant waste in the program. Residents of Native American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities may qualify for enhanced Lifeline assistance (up to an additional $25.00) and expanded Link-Up support (up to an additional $70.00). States with their own programs may have their own eligibility guidelines. On January 31, 2012, the Federal Communications Commission approved an order changing the Lifeline Program to reduce fraud and abuse.Federal Communications Commission, \\"FCC Reforms, Modernizes Lifeline Program for Low-Income Americans\\", FCC 12-11, February 6, 2012, Washington D.C.\\"The Universal Service Fund: Lifeline Program Modernization\\", connectednation.org, summary. In April 2013 a hearing was held before the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, to explore issues relating to whether the program should be eliminated or placed under a budget cap, and if not, whether a freeze should be put in place until the reform measures currently underway are completed. The Lifeline program is limited to one discount per household. A \\"household\\" includes anyone living at the same address \\"who share income(s) and household expenses\\". Link-Up America assisted consumers with the installation costs of phone service. Link-Up program paid up to 50% or $30 of the telephone service installation fees, and provides up to $200 of one year, interest-free loans for any additional installation costs. On January 31, 2012, among other changes to the Lifeline Program, the FCC announced that they would be ending the Link-Up America Program, except on Indian reservations. In 2016, Lifeline services were expanded to offer a broadband option.FCC Votes To Propose New Privacy Rules For Internet Service Providers; NPR; Alina Selyukh; March 31, 2016 This is the proposed cost and data plan for the Lifeline program reform. On March 31, 2016 the Federal Communications Commission set a plan to reform the Lifeline program. The reform attempted to make the Lifeline program more modern and comprehensive to present day society. The 2016 Lifeline Modernization Order included that broadband service would be provided to low income households as an addition to the preexisting Lifeline program benefits. The Commission also set service standards in order to ensure the highest value for the Universal Service Fund. The FCC projected that the annual amount of mobile voice minutes available for each individual household per month will increase, while the cost of voice support will simultaneously decrease and will eventually become a completely unsubsidized service. The FCC also appointed a National Eligibility Verifier whose purpose would be to determine the eligibility of the independent subscribers to the program. In February 2017, FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai suspended the expansion of Lifeline. While current broadband providers are technically authorized to provide subsidized broadband, the FCC itself could not point to a single company that actively provides broadband. Companies * Assurance Wireless * Safelink Wireless =Rural health care= The rural health care program provides subsidies to health care providers for telehealth and telemedicine services, typically by a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities at affordable rates. The Rural Health Care Support Mechanism allows rural health care providers to pay rates for telecommunications services similar to those of their urban counterparts, making telehealth services affordable. Over $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program. In 2013, the rural health care program paid out $159 million. There are three components of the Rural Health Care Program: Telecommunications Program, HCF Program, Pilot Program. \\"The Telecommunications Program (formerly known as the Primary Program) provides discounts for telecommunications services for eligible health care providers (HCPs).\\" \\"The Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) Program is the newest component of the Rural Health Care Program. The HCF Program will provide a 65 percent discount on eligible expenses related to broadband connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and consortia, which can include non-rural HCPs (if the consortium has a majority of rural sites).\\" \\"The Pilot Program provides funding for up to 85 percent of eligible costs of the construction or implementation of statewide and/or regional broadband networks. There are 50 active projects involving hundreds of health care providers (HCPs).\\" =Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)= The E-Rate program provides subsidies for Internet access and general telecommunications services to schools and libraries. The subsidies typically pay 20% to 90% of costs based on need, with rural and low-income schools receiving the greatest subsidy. In 2013, the E-Rate program paid out $2.2 billion. USAC has more than $37.3 billion in E-Rate funding commitments and $26.8 billion in E-Rate funding disbursements issued to schools and libraries nationwide through the E-Rate from 1998 to 2013. Every year since 2010, the Wireline Competition Bureau announces the funding cap for the E-Rate program to adhere to the current needs of schools and libraries telecommunications. \\"The Eligible Services List (ESL) for each funding year provides guidance on the eligibility of products and services under the Schools and Libraries Program.\\" In 2015, USAC outlined two specific categories for grouping the ESL, and one category for miscellaneous services. * \\"Category One ** Data Transmission Services and Internet Access, and Voice Services * Category two ** Internal Connections, Managed Internal Broadband Services, and Basic Maintenance of Internal Connections * Miscellaneous\\" Starting in the 2011 funding year, the different types of schools eligible to receive benefits now include: * \\"School on Tribal lands * Schools that serve children with physical, cognitive, and behavioral disabilities * Schools that serve children with medical needs * Juvenile justice schools, where eligible * Schools with 35 percent or more students eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\\" Administration =Universal Service Administrative Company= The logo of the Universal Service Administrative Company Following the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the subsequent creation of the Universal Service Fund, the FCC designated the independent American nonprofit corporation named the \\"Universal Service Administrative Company\\" (Universal Service Administrative Co) to manage the contribution of revenue to and distribution of funding from the Universal Service Fund. The Schools and Libraries Corporation and the Rural Health Care Corporation were merged into the USAC on January 1, 1999. The USAC is a subsidiary of the National Exchange Carrier Association, and is governed by a 19-person board of directors representing various stakeholder interests and carries out rules adopted by the FCC. The company has 356 employees. USAC reports quarterly revenue projections detailing what contributions are expected and detailing what actions are taken in the expansion and bolstering of universal service. The USAC receives contributions from all companies providing interstate and international telephone and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service. Contributors send payments based on projected quarterly earnings. The FCC does not require companies to charge their customers for these contributions ‚Äì this funding decision is left up to the individual companies. This revenue is deposited into a central fund, from which the USAC distributes money to the four central services at the core of the USF: High Cost, Low Income, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care. Providers of telecommunication services are legally required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. \\"The USAC collects revenue data from USF contributors on the FCC Form 499-A (Annual Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet) and FCC Form 499-Q (Quarterly Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet).\\" The USAC is responsible for estimating how much money is needed for the USF program. The USAC provides a \\"demand filing,\\" to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) each quarter in its FCC Filings. In the past, only long-distance companies made contributions to support the federal Universal Service Fund. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded the types of companies contributing to the Universal Service Fund. Currently, all telecommunications companies that provide service between states, including long-distance companies, local telephone companies, wireless telephone companies, paging companies, and payphone providers, are required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund. Carriers providing international services also must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. In June 2006, the FCC voted to require providers of VoIP services to contribute to the Universal Service Fund the same way traditional telephone services had been contributing. While the USAC cannot act without Congressional approval, it can make recommendations. USAC recommendations have resulted in expanding telecommunication resources, particularly broadband Internet and mobile access to schools and libraries, and recognizing VoIP as a form of interstate and international communication, which requires those companies providing VoIP services to contribute to the USF. =Federal Communications Commission= The FCC oversees the USAC's administration of the Universal Service Fund, and institutes reforms as it sees fit. Although the fund is limited by the scope of US law, (mainly the 1996 Telecommunications Act) the FCC has played a part in making several changes to the fund, including shifting funds from the high cost program towards broadband expansion. Under the FCC, there is an Enforcement Bureau that investigates and pursues the violators of the Act of 1996 and any Commissions rules. Funding All providers of telecommunication service support the Universal Service Fund. These providers contribute to the fund \\"based on their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues.\\" This percentage of contribution is \\"adjusted every quarter based on projected demand for Universal Service funding.\\" As of the end of 2019, telecommunication companies were required to contribute 25% of their revenue to the fund. Currently, the FCC has proposed to lower this to 21.2% for the first quarter of 2020. However, not all companies cover the charge themselves. Instead they bill their customers to make up the amount. While companies are not required to charge the customer, they must come up with the funds and many service providers find this to be their solution. The contributions are collected by the Universal Service Administrative Company and disbursed towards four programs that the federal USF supports, as directed by the FCC. State universal service funds Taxes, Fees, and Government Charges on Wireless Service, July 2016 Many US States have their own universal service funds, with budget and administration independent of the much larger federal fund. Examples include in California, New York, Wisconsin, and Texas. Controversy Wide disagreement over the nature and administration of the USF exists in telecommunications policy circles. Such disagreements fragment traditional partisan alliances in the United States Congress. Fears continue to abound about what such subsidies mean, and how it will affect telecommunications in the long run.Peres, K. (2007, Winter). Subverting the public interest: Deregulation in the telecommunications industry. New Labor Forum, 16(1), 87‚Äì95. Critics of the USF programs argue that there are many macro-level problems which are caused by the ¬®systematic design problems that have significant adverse impact on consumers and the carriers providing service.¬® Service providers and consumers alike are disproportionately granted subsidies or billed because of the lack of organization among the four programs. Discussions continue over whether the USF should be used to provide services such as broadband internet access.Fitchard, K. (2008, September). Broadband for all. Telephony, 6‚Äì8. Plans to subsidize internet service providers has led to backlash from traditional telecommunications carriers. Traditional carriers argue that ‚Äúthe relevant provisions of the 1996 Act do not give the FCC carte blanche to play regulatory Robin Hood with their universal service contributions.‚Äù Because ISP's and traditional telecommunications carriers often provide similar services, the USF may ‚Äúviolate[] the pro-competitive precepts of the 1996 Act.\\" =Concerns about 2011 changes= In 2011, the FCC made material changes in the USF program, largely benefiting the largest traditional telephone companies in the country, which now have double the access to funding than they had before those changes. Smaller traditional and wireless carriers were given reduced access to support going forward, which means that unless the FCC makes future changes, the country will depend in large measure on two carriers to carry out broadband deployment and ongoing operations in rural areas in the future, and in very rural areas of the country, service may diminish. =Waste and fraud= The issue of waste and fraud, as with many government programs, has been addressed as well. Gilroy stated, \\"The ability to ensure that only eligible services are funded, that funding is disbursed at the proper level of discount, that alleged services have been received, and the integrity of the competitive bidding process is upheld have been questioned\\". Improved auditing of particularly the E-rate program has been addressed.Gilroy, A. (2007). Universal service fund: Background and options for reform. [Washington, D.C.]: Congressional Research Service. Retrieved June 26, 2009, from http://lieberman.senate.gov/documents/crs/servicefund.pdf There have been multiple cases of waste and fraud throughout disbursement of subsidies from the Universal Service Fund. There is some concern on the lag time between application, approval, and actual receipt of funds. In terms of fraud, some school officials have been bribed by contractors working with corporations so that they use subsidies to purchase computer equipment from said corporation. In addition, some beneficiaries inaccurately report costs to inflate their subsidies amount. In terms of waste, some equipment subsidized by the USF has been left unused for several years. An investigation into potential fraud in 2004 revealed that contractors working with Hewlett-Packard bribed school officials. Hewlett-Packard wanted the schools to use subsidies provided by the fund to purchase computer equipment from Hewlett-Packard. The second example of fraud was when \\"Sandwich Isles Communication purposely inflated and inaccurately reported money to receive inflated subsidies.\\" Critics continue to raise concerns in regards to the wastefulness of the fund. For example, \\"$5 million worth of equipment purchased by Chicago public schools with E-rate funds was left unused in a warehouse for years.\\" Lastly, a problem that has plagued the program is the long lag time between the overall application of the programs and the approval. The FCC has responded to issues of waste and fraud in the USF. In an attempt to combat them, the FCC conducted an investigation into the Lifeline program which revealed \\"serious weaknesses in federal safeguards, allowing providers to indiscriminately override checks that are supposed to prevent wasteful and fraudulent activities.\\" As a result, Ajit Pai, current FCC commissioner withdrew some Lifeline subsidies \\"to come up with a better way to vet them for potential waste, fraud and abuse.\\" Pai argued that it is necessary to halt some funds towards programs riddled with fraud because \\"putting the designations on hold gives the FCC the chance to make sure the process is legally defensible and to avoid potentially stranding customers if the courts ultimately deem the process unlawful\\". In early 2018, the FCC Chairman Ajit Pai proposed a plan to scale back the USF's Lifeline program. Pai claimed the proposed cutbacks would encourage business investment in low income communities, reducing the need for the government spending on the program. Pai also referenced the fraud that surrounds the usage of the program as a reason to scale back Lifeline. If passed and put into effect, this cutback would end Lifeline access for 8 million people, which accounts for about 70% of the program's recipients. In the American territory of Puerto Rico, this would translate to about 17% of its population that would lose access. Nine U.S. Senators issued a joint letter opposing the cutbacks, contending that, \\"The Lifeline Program is essential for millions of Americans who rely on subsidized internet access to find jobs, schedule doctor's appointments, complete their school assignments, interface with the government, and remain connected in a digital economy.\\" The FCC must now decide between the high cost and the USF's goal for \\"universal access\\" with this program. This cut to the Lifeline program prevents other smaller companies known as resellers from \\"buying network capacity from big telecom providers and then selling it back to low-income consumers at cheaper rates.\\" This is problematic for the majority of Lifeline customers who rely on those cheaper rates. The current administration looks to be opposed to this program as they feels it is wasteful of taxpayer money. Since 2017, there has been a 21% decrease in the number of people being assisted by this program. In 2017 just under 11 million people were being assisted whereas now in 2019, slightly under 9 million people are receiving assistance. It is estimated 2.3 million people are no longer enrolled in this program. The USF has some issues in dealing with insufficient controls over determining who qualifies for funding, and limited auditing practices that are supposed to ensure that telecommunication companies are not overpaying or underpaying their dues to the fund. The USF is able to reward those living in rural or impoverished areas who are capable of paying the entire cost of personal telecommunication services. Critics argue that inconsistent and asymmetrical audits allow for wealthy consumers to avoid triggering some USF financial burdens. Wealthy landowners in rural estates decide to utilize USF subsidies and pay a fraction of what they can realistically afford. Critics note that reimbursing carriers on a ‚Äú‚Äòcost-plus‚Äô basis‚Äù creates ‚Äúincentives to increase rather than decreas[e] costs‚Äù By reimbursing ‚Äúcarriers for the full cost of infrastructure development plus 11.25 percent of those costs in profit,‚Äù the fund may expose itself to exploitation. = Concerns about 2018 changes = In May 2018, the FCC moved $8 billion from a private bank to the US Treasury. This anticipated move caused an uproar from FCC Democratic commissioners who were concerned about the money being allocated to large corporations instead of the citizens. FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel stated that this move \\"sacrificed $50 million in annual interest that could have been used to support rural broadband, telemedicine & internet in schools.\\" Although lawmakers and commissioners claimed that this move was unexpected, there was a letter previously written to the General Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2018 asking for a review on the plan to review the funds. The GAO claimed that the USF funds are not regulated as intensively as other government funds, so this move was an attempt to \\"improve management and oversight of the funds.\\" After the 2018 USF changes, VoIP service providers are now required to provide funds for the USF. For example, Vonage must charge an additional 10.10% fee. However, they are exempt from the cost of using the Internet for information transport whereas DSL internet providers and modern cable services must burden the cost. This expands cost distortion to long-distance telephone providers and it raises the cost of telecommunications service for more consumers. On May 21, the FCC issued an order that prohibited USF programs from buying equipment from Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE. These companies are considered a risk to national security by American intelligence agencies. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow commented that the Trump Administration are ¬®aware of security issues, sanctions issues, technology theft issues, et cetera.¬® =Declining revenues= The rapidly changing interstate and international telecommunications markets can quickly and unpredictably bring about changes in USF funding levels. Dorothy Attwood of the FCC Wireline Competition Bureau stated, \\"One striking development that we've witnessed in the interstate marketplace is the steady decline of interstate revenues. Although traditional long-distance revenues grew consistently between 1984 and 1997, they're now in a period of steady decline\\". She pointed out that competition in the interstate long-distance market, wireless substitution, and bundling of service packages that blur traditional service categories are all reducing revenues that serve to finance the USF. Service providers simply transferred the cost to customers in the form of a long-distance surcharge to make up for reduced revenue. While the expenditures of the USF have increased since its inception, in part due to expansion of support paid to competitive providers, the revenues on which contributions are made ‚Äì interstate and international telecommunications revenues ‚Äì have become increasingly more difficult for contributors to identify as a result of evolution of services offered. Overall revenues reported by telecommunications companies have steadily increased, if information service revenues are included. However, the revenues for these services are no longer subject to contribution. Proposed reform =Expanding revenue sources= Debate over the Universal Service Fund has consistently involved the scope of the funding, which technology types and companies should fund the program, which groups should be eligible for benefits, and the need to clean up waste and fraud in the program. Proposals have been made to increase the number of sources from which universal service fund is collected. This could include expanding contributions to include intrastate telephone services (calls within single states), voice over IP (computer-to-computer calls), and information services such as broadband, and increasing contribution requirements from wireless communication providers. =Failed legislation= A draft proposal of the Telecommunications Act of 2005 was the subject of hearings in Congress. The proposal outlined a significant restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ultimately the House of Representatives passed a bill, the Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act of 2006 (COPE ‚Äì H.R.5252.RS, S.2686). The bill was sent from the House to the Senate, where subsequent readings left it awaiting a legislative action. Under the proposed restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, greater emphasis on the wide availability of broadband and mobile access would be considered. Additionally, consideration of revenue contribution to the Universal Service Fund would be radically revised, given that the creation of obligatory broadband and mobile communication access would require a wide range of broadband, mobile, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service providers to contribute a portion of their revenue to the fund. Lastly, the Act urged an FCC consideration of the universal service structure. The bill was not passed. In January 2007, Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) sponsored a bill (the Universal Service for Americans Act) that would increase universal service tax base to include broadband ISPs and VoIP providers, to fund broadband deployment in rural and low-income regions of the country. This bill was referred to committee, but as no further action was taken on it by the 110th Congress, the bill never became law.The Library of Congress. (2009). S.101. Retrieved from http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s101: Since then the only congressional action has been H.R. 176, introduced by Congressman Bob Latta (R-OH) on February 13, 2009, which states that, \\"in order to continue aggressive growth in our Nation's telecommunications and technology industries, the United States Government should 'Get Out of the Way and Stay Out of the Way'.\\" It is currently in committee.The Library of Congress. (2009). H.RES.176. Retrieved from http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi- bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.res.176: On July 22, 2010, the Universal Service Reform Act of 2010 was introduced by Representatives Boucher (D-Va) and Terry (R-NE). The measure is intended to improve and modernize the USF by reining in the size of the fund and promoting broadband deployment. =Supporting natural monopolies= The status quo only benefits powerful telecommunications companies. In the interest of reducing waste, limited support to a monopoly universal service provider for each territory has been considered. Wireless technology is increasingly favored by consumers, and can cover a single territory often for less than landline technology. However, wireless has traditionally been a competitive industry, which has resulted in a variety of innovative services for consumers, but means that supporting wireless companies requires a complex understanding of how to allocate funding on a shared basis, in order to avoid injury to the positive forces of competition. = Expanding rural broadband = In March 2016, the FCC unanimously voted to provide $20 billion over the next 10 years in \\"support for small carriers.\\" The previous FCC chairman Tom Wheeler under the Obama Administration implemented this reform. The FCC will be offering the fund $20 billion over the next 10 years to support service in \\"high cost areas.\\" This reform is a modernization of the program support of broadband in \\"high cost areas.\\" It will target communities that most need support. Reformation of the Lifeline program included minimum service requirement standards implemented to ensure that consumers benefited the most from the program. Pai and the proponents of the budget cuts claim that the Lifeline program is being abused by resellers claiming that some recipients listed in the databases are deceased or do not exist. Pai's hope is that this budget cut will stimulate the free market and allow existing broadband networks to expand their infrastructure into the rural areas. These small carriers are also known as \\"rate-of-return\\" carriers; these carriers have made significant progress in recent years but many still do not have access to \\"terrestrial fixed broadband.\\" The reform is made up of three main elements: \\"Modernizes Existing Universal Service Program for Rate- of-Return Carriers\\", \\"Create Two Paths to a 'Connect America Fund' for Rate-of Return Carriers\\" and \\"Increase Fiscal Responsibility in the Universal Service Fund.\\" In 2017, new FCC chairman under the Trump Administration, Ajit Varadaraj Pai, plans to keep rural areas a priority. He wants to bridge \\"the digital divide between rural and urban areas\\" by working on \\"expanding broadband options\\". Pai believes that there is waste occurring between the private and public sectors as private capital is already being given to areas in order to build out networks. However, some of these areas are still being subsidized. Pai intends to make sure that broadband accessibility is included in an infrastructure bill to come. This decision from Pai is reducing the impact of the Lifeline program, some even speculating that he may eventually dismantle the entire program. Out of the four USF programs, the Lifeline program is currently the only one without a strict budget cap. Lifeline can go over its current budget as long as the FCC provides a reason as to why they need to spend more money. This allows the FCC to subsidize communication services to people with low income. As stated above, this will most likely change as the FCC is reviewing Pai's proposal on November 16, 2017 to set a budget cap on the Lifeline program.

It is famous for its ancient Shiva temple, namely Aatcheeswara swamy Temple which is one of the Devaram temples. Acharapakkam town is about 96 km south-west from Chennai city, which is now included with the Chennai Metropolitan Area limits. Aatcheeswarar temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva located near Acharapakkam, Tamil Nadu, and India. The temple is praised in the hymns of Saint Tirugnanasambandar. This is the 29th shrine in Thondai region praised in Thevaram hymns. This temple is around 1000‚Äì2000 years old. It is believed that Arulmigu Aatcheeswarar Temple is associated with the legend of Tripurasamhaaram (related to that at Tiruvatikai Veerattaanam). Legends state that when Lord Shiva was travelling in his chariot to destroy the Tripurams, the axle of the chariot broke in this village into two pieces. Lord Shiva recollected that he didn't pray to Lord Ganesha before setting out for travel. It is also said that a Pandya King, who was on his way to bring soil from river Ganga's banks for construction of a dam on a local river nearby this place happened to pass through this village in his chariot. While passing, the axle of his chariot is also said to have broken in this very village in to two pieces. Hence the name of this village came to being as Achu Iru Paagam Meaning- \\"Axle into two pieces\\" Later this name eventually became Achirupakkam and then to Acharapakkam. The town is also famous for the Mazhai Malai Madha Church, which is visited by thousands of Christians every year. The church is popular with people of other faiths too. According to locals, in 1969, as severe drought prevailed in the region, a car procession was organised for Mother Mary at the Acharapakkam hill and prayers were offered. But astonishingly, even before the car procession ended, the place saw a heavy downpour, with thunder and lightning. Mother Mary was honored by locals as 'Mazhai Malai Madha' (Mountain Rain Mary) and a grotto was built at the place. The shrine we see today is built at the same spot. The church has of late become very popular with people of all faiths and has become a tourist attraction. For Christian devotees, a walk up the stairs leading to the top of a small hillock is considered a 'must-do' activity. Location Acharapakkam is located along the busy Chennai-Tuticorin National Highway NH32 or GST Road, 3 km from the famous temple town Melmaruvathur. Taluk Headquarters is Madurantakam. The Police Station in Acharapakkam is one of the oldest police stations in Tamil Nadu, witnessing over 100 years of its existence. Demographics India census, Acharapakkam had a population of 9013. Males and females each have an equal percentage of the population. Its literacy rate of almost 73% is higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 56% of the males and 44% of females being literate. 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. Transportation As Acharapakkam lies on the Busy NH45, this place is easily reachable from any part of the state. TNSTC-VPM operates buses between Acharapakkam and major parts of the district, and also to some deep interior villages. Although long-distance buses (SETC & others) don't stop here at Acharapakkam, due to its proximity to Melmaruvathur, one can easily access Acharapakkam by alighting at Melmaruvathur.

(born 1933, in K√°loz, Hungary), is an author and writer.  Early career and influences  Vizinczey's first published works were poems which appeared in George Lukacs's Budapest magazine Forum in 1949, when the writer was 16. He studied under Lukacs at the University of Budapest and graduated from the city's Academy of Theatre and Film Arts in 1956. He wrote at that time two plays, The Last Word and Mama, which were banned by the Hungarian Communist regime. He took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and after a short stay in Italy, ended up in Canada speaking only 50 words of English, and eventually taking Canadian citizenship. He learned English writing scripts for Canada's National Film Board and the CBC. He edited Canada's short-lived literary magazine, Exchange. In 1966 he moved to London. Vizinczey cites his literary ideals as Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Balzac, Stendhal and Kleist.Truth and Lies in Literature, p. 5. His best-known works are the novels In Praise of Older Women (1965) and An Innocent Millionaire (1983). In Praise of Older Women In Praise of Older Women: the amorous recollections of Andr√°s VajdaFirst British edition, London: Barrie & Rockliff, 1966. is a bildungsroman whose young narrator has sexual encounters with women in their thirties and forties in Hungary, Italy, and Canada. \\"The book is dedicated to older women and is addressed to young men--and the connection between the two is my proposition\\" is the book's epigraph. Kildare Dobbs wrote in Saturday Night, \\"Here is this Hungarian rebel who in 1957 could scarcely speak a word of our language and who even today speaks it with an impenetrable accent and whose name moreover we can't pronounce, and he has the gall to place himself, with his first book and in his thirty-third year, among the masters of plain English prose...\\" In 2001 it was translated for the first time into French, and became a best-seller in France. It has twice been made into a movie: a 1978 Canadian production starring Tom Berenger as Andras Vayda, and a subsequent 1997 Spanish production featuring Faye Dunaway as Condesa. In 2010, the book was reissued as a Penguin Modern Classic.Gerald Jacobs, \\"In Praise of Older Women by Stephen Vizinczey: review\\", The Telegraph, 16 May 2010. An Innocent Millionaire First published in 1983, An Innocent Millionaire tells the story of Mark Niven, the son of an American actor who makes an uncertain living in Europe. \\"Mankind, we are told, is divided into the haves and the have-nots, but there are those who both have the goods and do not, and they live the tensest lives.\\" The boy who spends his childhood in various countries \\"has no emotional address\\" and once financial pressures led to the divorce of his parents, he becomes enchanted with the idea of finding a Spanish treasure ship. He finds both love and the treasure ship, but the fortune turns into a nightmare and his happiness with a married woman ends in tragedy. The novel was praised by critics including Graham Greene and Anthony Burgess. Burgess wrote in Punch that Vizinczey could \\"teach the English how to write English\\", praised the novel's \\"prose style and its sly apophthegms, as well as in the solidity of its characters, good and detestable alike.\\" Burgess ended his review by saying: \\"I was entertained but also deeply moved: here is a novel set bang in the middle of our corrupt world that, in some curious way, breathes a kind of desperate hope.\\" The London Literary Review called the novel \\"an authentic social epic, which reunites, after an estrangement of nearly a century, intellectal and moral edification with exuberant entertainment.\\" Essays Vizinczey has written two books of literary, philosophical and political essays: The Rules of Chaos (1969) and Truth and Lies in Literature (1985).

The genus was formerly divided into two subgenera: Leachia and Pyrgopsis, but is no longer. Members of this genus live in tropical and sub-tropical waters worldwide. The mantle is up to 20 cm long in the largest species. Leachia are characterised by the presence of two parallel ridges bearing raised cartilage spikes, which run along the underside of the body near the head. They have large round fins, which often constitute 20‚Äì30% of the entire mantle length. Like most glass squids, members of this genus possess a ring of light organs around their eyes. Bioluminescent cells produce light that cancels the shadow cast by their large eyes. Typical of cranchiid squids, juvenile Leachia species have stalked eyes. As they mature, females develop light organs on the ends of their third arm pairs. These are thought to be used in mating displays to attract males. References * Norman, M. 2000.

Shannon immediately seeks out his sweetheart, Mary Jones, who readily accepts his proposal. However, when he clumsily explains why they have to get married that day, she breaks up with him. He returns to the country club to break the news to his partner and the lawyer. Though Jimmy's heart is set on Mary, Meekin persuades him to try proposing to other women to save them both from ruin or even possibly jail. He has Jimmy look in the club's dining room; Jimmy knows seven women there (the chances of the title). Each turns him down. In desperation, Jimmy asks any woman he comes across. Even the hat check girl rejects him. He finally finds one who agrees, but it turns out she is underage when her mother spots her and takes her away. Meanwhile, Mary's mother persuades her to reconsider. She writes a note agreeing to marry Jimmy and sends the hired hand to deliver it. Unaware of this, Meekin has his partner's predicament (and potential inheritance) printed in the newspaper, asking would-be brides to go to the Broad Street Church at 5 p.m. Hordes of veiled women descend on the place. When they spot Jimmy (who had fallen asleep on a pew), they begin to fight over him. Then the clergyman appears and announces he believes it all to be a practical joke. Infuriated, the women chase after Jimmy. While hiding, he gets Mary's note. He races to Mary's house, pursued by furious females. Along the way, he accidentally starts an avalanche, which drives away the mob. When he gets to Mary's home, Meekin shows him his watch; he is minutes too late. Mary still wants to marry him, money or no, but he refuses to let her share his impending disgrace. When he leaves, he sees by the church clock that Meekin's watch is fast. He and Mary wed just in time. Cast * Buster Keaton as Jimmy Shannon * T.

The play had been an enormous hit on Broadway and touring and Schenck paid stage director John McDermott $25,000 with the promise that he would direct the film. Schenck had Keaton make the film instead. Keaton had hated the play and called it a sappy farce, but he owed money to Schenck and had to make the film to settle his debt. Shooting began in January 1925. Keaton intended to finish with a fadeout of him still running from the mob of women, dissatisfied, but unable to come up with any better ending. However, during a preview, the audience laughed most loudly when Keaton's character accidentally dislodged a rock, which struck two others, sending them tumbling down after the hero. Keaton had 150 papier-m√¢ch√© and chicken wire fakes made in various sizes up to in diameter for what is now considered one of his most memorable sequences. Keaton disliked the film but thought that the tumbling rocks scene saved it. Keaton cast Doris Deane as one of the \\"7 chance\\" fianc√©es, as a favor to his friend Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle (Deane was Arbuckle's fianc√©e). Reception =Critical response= Church in Seven Chances The film was another box office success for Keaton, grossing $598,288 domestically. When released, Mordaunt Hall, the film critic for The New York Times, gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, \\"After viewing Buster Keaton's latest comedy, Seven Chances, one is justified in assuming; that there is a slump in the fun market...it took the combined efforts of three experienced gag men to turn the stage effort into screen material. The result inclines one's belief in the old adage concerning too many cooks, as although there are quite a number of good twists some of them have been produced in haste. The ideas did not have time to ripen and are therefore put before the audience in a rather sour state.\\"Hall, Mordaunt. The New York Times, film review, March 17, 1925. Last accessed: February 19, 2008. Film critic Dennis Schwartz liked the film and wrote, \\"A less ambitious but, nevertheless, hilarious Buster Keaton comedy. It's taken from the play by David Belasco and scripted by a team of writers. This minor film is based on a one-joke premise, but it has one of the greatest ever chase scenes. Keaton proves he's a master at building the comedy until it reaches its absolute breaking point.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, August 29, 2005. Last accessed: February 19, 2008. Time Out London gave the film a positive review and wrote, \\"Less ambitious and less concerned with plastic values than the best of Keaton, this is nevertheless a dazzlingly balletic comedy in which Buster has a matter of hours to acquire the wife on which a seven million dollar inheritance depends...From this leisurely start, the film takes off into a fantastically elaborate, gloriously inventive chase sequence, in which Buster escapes the mob of pursuing harridans only to find an escalating avalanche of rocks taking over at his heels as he hurtles downhill. Added only after an initial preview, the rocks make for one of the great Keaton action gags.\\"Time Out .

It is a frazione of the town of Teramo. Geography Scapriano lies in a hilly area about 2 km from Teramo, the provincial capital. Just below the village the stream Fosso Grande feeds into the Vezzola river. Crossing this river is as stone bridge which the locals refer to as the \\"Ponte del lu stucc\\". The name probably derives from a set of registered documents under the heading \\"Stucchi\\" which dealt with small herds of local prized sheep that stayed in Abruzzo over the winter instead of heading south to Puglia as part of the great transumanza. The town is located on one of the paths that the shepherds used in their local sheep herd migrations. History One medieval administrative document dated 926 mentions Manfredi, Count of \\"Aprutium\\" (present day Abruzzo as donating several pieces of real estate in and around Scapriano to a local church by the name of Santa Maria. Scapriano is home to the small ancient Church of Saint Martin, recently restored with the assistance of the local townsfolk. Another historical church is that of Saint Silvester and still another church, Saint John was once located here.

Signatures from John's 1770 Marriage Bond Background Schenck was born in the now-defunct Amwell Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey on May 26, 1750, the son of Gerret Roelofse Schenck (1719‚Äì1794) and Marytje van Sicklen (1722‚Äì1778). His ancestors were early Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam who had moved into New Jersey in the 1690s. In 1770, Schenck married Aida Sutphen (1754‚Äì1818), daughter of Aert Sutphen (1718‚Äì1798) and Jannetje Van Mater (1724-aft. 1798), whose ancestors were also part of the New Amsterdam Dutch settlement. When Schenck died on his farm in Amwell Township, he left a sizeable estate. He is buried in Pleasant Ridge Cemetery, in what is now Raritan Township, along with his wife, parents and many of his children.Wright, Terry. \\"Centennial nears for Pleasant Ridge Cemetery in Raritan Twp., burial site of N.J. notables\\", The Hunterdon County Democrat, March 27, 2013. Accessed May 29, 2013. \\"Then there are several Revolutionary war soldiers, the most famous of whom is Capt. (later Col.) John Schenck, who led a company at the Battle of Monmouth but is more famous locally as leader of the Amwell Militia against the British cavalry in the so-called 'Amwell Skirmish.'\\" His marker reads \\"In memory of Captain John Schenck, who departed this life August 22, 1823, aged 73 years, 2 months and 27 days.\\" Military service In 1775, Schenck was one of the first residents of Hunterdon County to volunteer to serve as a Minuteman in the months following the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He first served as a lieutenant and then was elected a captain of what was to become a company of the 3rd Regiment Hunterdon Militia. In eight years of service with the Militia, Captain Schenck fought in most of the major battles of the War in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He was at the battles of Monmouth, Trenton, the Second Battle of Trenton (where he took command of another 3rd Regiment company after its lieutenants deserted and its captain fell sick), Princeton (where a cannonball took away a tree branch he had stooped to pass under), Bound Brook and Germantown. Ambush of Geary Captain Schenck is best remembered by the residents of Hunterdon County for a small skirmish (the Ambush of Geary, as it is called locally) that took place there on December 14, 1776. Arriving home on leave from Washington's army across the Delaware, Schenck was informed by a cousin that a scouting party of British dragoons were in the area. Schenck quickly assembled a party of irregulars from family members and neighbors and set an ambush for the British as they returned from their mission. Schenck and his party successfully took the dragoons by surprise and with their first volley killed the troop's officer, Cornet Francis Geary. Whaleboat Raid on Flatbush In June 1778, as retaliation for similar kidnappings by British troops and Loyalist forces of Continental officers, Schenck plus Captain William Marriner and a small team of men from Matawan launched a whaleboat from New Jersey to the coast of Brooklyn with the purpose of seizing Loyalist officials and figures with summer residences in and around Flatbush. The list included David Mathews, the Mayor of New York, Captain James Moncrief, and Theophylact Bache, President of the New York Chamber of Commerce. Schenck had prior deep knowledge of the area from his childhood. Mathews was the first and primary target, but they were unsuccessful in securing him. At the home of British Captain Jacob Suydam they released from his home Captain Alexander Graydon, who had been held there as a prisoner of war. Suydam and Moncreif were successfully captured, and then Schenck and the crew successfully returned their men and prisoners to New Jersey without incident.Hornor, William S.

TESE is often recommended to patients who cannot produce sperm by ejaculation due to azoospermia.  Medical Uses  TESE is recommended to patients who do not have sperm present in their ejaculate, azoospermia, or who cannot ejaculate at all. In general, azoospermia can be divided into obstructive and non-obstructive subcategories. TESE is primarily used for non- obstructive azoospermia, where patients do not have sperm present in the ejaculate but who may produce sperm in the testis. Azoospermia in these patients could be a result of Y chromosome microdeletions, cancer of the testicles or damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, which regulate sperm production. Often in these cases, TESE is used as a second option, after prior efforts to treat the azoospermia through hormone therapy have failed. However, if azoospermia is related to a disorder of sexual development, such as Klinefelter syndrome, TESE is not currently used clinically; this is currently in the research phase. More rarely, TESE is used to extract sperm in cases of obstructive azoospermia. Obstructive azoospermia can be caused in a variety of ways: * vasectomy * trauma * congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) * cystic fibrosis. TESE can also be used as a fertility preservation option for patients undergoing gender reassignment surgery and who cannot ejaculate sperm.  Technique  Conventional TESE is usually performed under local, or sometimes spinal or general, anaesthesia. An incision in the median raphe of the scrotum is made and continued through the dartos fibres and the tunica vaginalis. The testicle and epidydymis are then visible. From here incision/s are through the outer covering of the testis to retrieve biopsies of seminiferous tubules, the structures which contain sperm. The incision is closed with sutures and each sample is assessed under a microscope to confirm the presence of sperm. Following extraction, sperm is often cryogenically preserved for future use, but can also be used fresh. = Micro-TESE = Micro-TESE, or microdissection testicular sperm extraction, includes the use of an operating microscope. This allows the surgeon to observe regions of seminiferous tubules of the testes that have more chance of containing spermatozoa. The procedure is more invasive than conventional TESE, requiring general anaesthetic, and usually used only in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia. Similarly to TESE, an incision is made in the scrotum and surface of the testicle to expose seminiferous tubules. However, this exposure is much more wide in micro-TESE. This allows exploration of the incision under the microscope to identify areas of tubules more likely to contain more sperm. If none can be identified, biopsies are instead taken at random from a wide range of locations. The incision is closed with sutures. Samples are re-examined post-surgery to locate and then purify sperm. When compared with conventional TESE, micro-TESE generally has higher success in extracting sperm; as such, micro-TESE is preferable in cases of non-obstructive azoospermia, where infertility is caused by a lack of sperm production rather than a blockage. In these cases, micro-TESE is more likely to yield sufficient sperm for use in ICSI. = TESE vs TESA = TESE is different to testicular sperm aspiration (TESA). TESA is done under local anaethesia, does not involve an open biopsy and is suitable for patients with obstructive azoospermia.  Complications  Like all surgical operations, micro-TESE and TESE have risks of postoperative infection, bleeding and pain. However, TESE can result in testicular abnormalities and scarring of the tissue. The procedure can also cause testicular fibrosis and inflammation, which can reduce testicular function and cause testicular atrophy. Both procedures can alter the steroid function of the testes causing a decline in serum testosterone levels, which can result in testosterone deficiency. This can cause side-effects including muscle weakness, decreased sexual function, anxiety, leading to sleep deficiency. The blood supply to the testis can also be altered during this procedure, potentially reducing supply. Long-term follow-ups are often recommended to prevent these complications. Micro-TESE has limited postoperative complications compared with TESE. The use of the surgical microscope allows for small specific incisions to retrieve seminiferous tubules and evade damaging blood vessels by avoiding regions with no vasculature. If TESE needs to be repeated due to insufficient sperm recovery, patients are usually advised to wait 6‚Äì12 months in order to allow adequate healing of the testis before further surgery.

The system is a \\"weapon-locating radar\\", designed to detect and track incoming mortar, artillery and rocket fire to determine the point of origin for counterbattery fire. It is currently in service at battalion and higher levels in the United States Army, United States Marine Corps and Australian Army. Also Turkish Army , Portugal and Ukrainian ArmyUkraine Monitors Cease-Fire Violations With U.S.-Supplied Radars , Radio Free Europe (27 December 2017) are among the users. The radar is typically trailer-mounted and towed by a Humvee. Upgrades Firefinder (V)7 adds a modular azimuth position system (MAPS). MAPS has a north seeking laser gyrocompass and a microprocessor controlled Honeywell H-726 inertial navigation system. Prior Firefinders used a survey team to find site latitude, longitude, and direction to North. With MAPS, reaction time was limited only by site set-up, since system geo-position was pre-loaded before sortie deployment. Crew was reduced from 8 to 6. Firefinder (V)8 extends system performance, improves operator survivability and lowers life cycle cost. Greater processing power and the addition of a low noise amplifier to the radar antenna improves detection range (by up to 50%) and performance accuracy against certain threats. Operations/maintainers/specifications Delivery of two Q-36 radar systems to Ukraine in Lviv on 14 November 2015 The AN/TPQ-36 is an electronically steered radar, meaning the radar antenna does not actually move while in operation. The radar antenna may however be moved manually if required. The system may also be operated in a friendly fire mode to determine the accuracy of counterbattery return fire, or for conducting radar registration or mean point of impact calibrations for friendly artillery. It can locate mortars, artillery, and rocket launchers, simultaneously locate 10 weapons, locate targets on first round and perform high-burst, datum-plane, and impact registrations. It can be used to adjust friendly fire, interfaces with tactical fire and predicts the impact of hostile projectiles. Its maximum range is 24 km with effective range of 18 km for artillery and 24 km for rockets. Its azimuth sector is 90¬∞. It operates in the X-band at 32 frequencies. Peak transmitted power is 23 kW, min. It features permanent storage for 99 targets, has a field exercise mode and uses a digital data interface. Manufacturers Northrop Grumman manufactures the AN/TPQ-36(V)8 Firefinder radar. Before acquisition by Raytheon, the Hughes Aircraft Co. developed the AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar at its Fullerton, California facility, and manufactured it at its Forest, Mississippi plant. Nomenclature Per the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), the nomenclature AN/TPQ-36 is thus derived: * \\"AN/\\" indicating Army/Navy(Marines)--a system nomenclature derived from the JETDS. * \\"T\\" for 'transportable', indicating it is carried by a vehicle but is not an integral part of said vehicle (compare with 'V' for vehicle-mounted). * \\"P\\" indicating a position finder (radar). * \\"Q\\" for a special-purpose(multipurpose) radar, in this case counterbattery. * \\"36\\" is the 36'th version of this family, of TPQ radars.

Freeman in his feature directorial debut. It shows the story of Marcus (Brendan Sexton III), a teenage inner-city 'street kid' whose internal conflicts include running with a gang who want to move up in more serious crimes and a girl he meets (Isidra Vega) who tries to steer him clear from a potential life in prison. What Marcus really wants is to move out of the city to New Mexico and gain space. The film won the Audience, Best Director, and Best Cinematography Awards at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival--the first film ever to win three awards at the festival. It was released by United Artists and stars Brendan Sexton III and Edie Falco. Plot 14-year-old Marcus Frederick (Brendan Sexton III) resides in Manhattan's Lower East Side with his grandmother, Lucy (Lynn Cohen). His mother, Joanna (Edie Falco), has spent the last nine years of Marcus's life in prison for smuggling undocumented aliens into New Mexico. Presumably, Marcus's father died in a car accident when Marcus was five. Lucy owns and operates her own establishment called Lucy's, where she works as a bartender, giving Marcus a lot of unsupervised time to spend with his four friends Chip (David Roland Frank), Benny (Carlo Alban), Louis (Mtume Gant), and Harold (Antoine McLean). The group spends the majority of their time committing petty theft and hanging around in their underground clubhouse near the waterfront. Chip has grown tired of the small-time crime and wants to move into more serious theft, such as robbery. Marcus has aspirations to move back to his home state of New Mexico and live on a ranch with his uncle Billy who had promised to mail Marcus an airplane ticket. However, Lucy doesn't believe Billy was being serious. Later that day, Marcus sells stolen merchandise to children during recess at the local elementary school while Chip serves as a lookout. There, Marcus meets 14-year-old Melena (Isidra Vega). Marcus invites Melena to his fifteenth birthday party, although she declines claiming her abusive father, Paco (Shawn Elliott), a tow truck driver, doesn't approve of her staying out late. That night, Melena sneaks out of her apartment and meets Marcus in front of the bar where she gives him her ski mask as a gift before leaving. The next morning, Marcus receives the flight ticket to New Mexico in the mail and relays this information to Lucy. Mack (L.M. Kit Carson), a regular patron at the bar, reveals to Lucy he actually sent Marcus the ticket (under the guise of Billy) believing it would do Marcus good if he left the city. Marcus, Benny, and Louis are subsequently introduced to Justin (Damian Corrente) and Shane (David Moscow), Chip's drug dealing friends from Miami. Marcus tells Melena about his plans to move to New Mexico and offers her to join him. Melena declines, knowing her father would never approve and not being able to afford the price of the ticket. Afterwards, Marcus gets caught by a plainclothes officer named Kramer (Jose Zuniga) after he continues to sell stolen merchandise to the elementary school children and is hauled off to the police station. Marcus is interrogated by Kramer and another detective named Hank (Richard Petrocelli) who threaten to charge him with commercial burglary and inform him that his mother is in prison for murder, not smuggling undocumented aliens like she had told him (it is implied that Joanna killed his father.) Marcus visits his mother and tells her about his meeting with Melena and the two of them planning to travel to New Mexico. Marcus then reveals that he knows she's in prison for killing his father. Joanna explains that his father was abusive towards her and Marcus and didn't know how to tell Marcus without him being upset. She also admits that she isn't up for parole until another four years, but promises Marcus they will go to New Mexico once she is out. Marcus is clearly done with her promises and leaves. Later, Marcus returns to the clubhouse where he is surprised by Mack who is a wanted fugitive hiding out from the police. Marcus sympathetically gives his ticket to Mack in hopes that it will help him with his dilemma. The following day, Marcus tells Melena and friends his decision to remain in New York in order to straighten his life out. At the clubhouse, the group reveals to Marcus they plan on breaking into a policeman's (Leslie Body) apartment and stealing his valuables. Marcus refuses to get involved after his run-in with the police. Paco drives to the clubhouse's location where Melena and Marcus congregate regularly. When Paco starts to get rough in disciplining Melena, Marcus intervenes before Paco shoves him into the lake and leaves with Melena. A vengeful Marcus rides his bicycle to Melena's apartment building and coldcocks Paco. Marcus and Melena leave and camp out in a tent for the day. They plan to meet at Penn Station at noon the next day to catch the train after coming to a consensus that they will travel to New Mexico. In order to procure the amount of money it costs for the train fare, Marcus joins his friends in the robbery plot. In the apartment, Harold finds and secretly steals the officer's gun before the group departs and returns to the clubhouse. Meanwhile, in his search for Melena, Paco sneaks inside the clubhouse and looks around. When he hears the group approaching, he hides in the closet. Chip insults Harold's ability to play darts which results in Harold pulling out the stolen gun and shooting the target on the dartboard to show off. Unknowingly, Harold has shot and killed Paco (through the closet door the dart board was hanging on) whose corpse falls from the closet. Unable to lift the body, Marcus takes the keys to Paco's tow truck from his pocket, and uses the crane on the tow truck to lift Paco and release him into a shallow grave. Harold feels guilty and Marcus fears that he may go to the police. He warns Benny to not let Harold talk before telling him he changed his mind and he is resuming his plans to go to New Mexico, though promises he'll return in two weeks. On the day Marcus and Melena are supposed to leave for New Mexico, Marcus visits the ruins of a building where he keeps a hidden stash of cash, only to find that it's missing along with the loot from the robbery. While Marcus is riding his bicycle downtown, he notices Chip showing off his brand new Diamondback bicycle to a crowd of onlookers. Marcus punches him in the face, accusing Chip of stealing the robbery loot and his stash of cash to pay for the bike. Justin and Shane accost Marcus before Justin reveals he stole Marcus's money. Justin, Shane, and Chip then mercilessly beat Marcus to the ground before leaving. Immediately after, Marcus returns to the clubhouse and takes the gun before noticing an unmarked car and police cruiser pull up and it's revealed that Benny had reported Paco's murder to the police. Meanwhile, two police officers question Lucy on Marcus's whereabouts. Soon after, Chip is arrested by the police. Running out of time and desperate for cash, Marcus enters a convenience store and holds the cashier, Duane, at gunpoint. Duane (Terry Alexander) hands over the cash and Marcus promises to pay him back. Marcus races to Penn Station where he reunites with Melena. The two board the train and Melena, not knowing her father is dead, remarks that her dad is going to kill her when he finds out she ran away. Marcus, knowing full well Paco won't be able to anything of the sort, doesn't respond.

D. Judah was the name of a 4-2-2 steam locomotive owned by the Central Pacific Railroad. It was named in honor of the railroad's first chief engineer, Theodore Dehone Judah, who had championed and surveyed a passable route over the Sierra Nevada for the Transcontinental Railroad.  History and career  Like its sister engine, C.P. Huntington, T. D. Judah was originally built by the Cooke Locomotive Works in 1863 for a railroad that was unable to pay for it. Later, the two were seen in the Cooke shops by Collis Huntington and purchased for use on the Central Pacific Railroad (CP), becoming the road's third and fourth locomotives respectively. Two other, larger engines, Gov. Stanford (number 1, built by Norris Locomotive Works) and Pacific (number 2, built by Mason Machine Works) had been purchased earlier. Originally built as a 4-2-4T Forney type, T. D. Judah was a locomotive and tender on one frame. In 1872 the engine was rebuilt as a 4-2-2 with separate tender and may have been given other mechanical upgrades like its sister engine. The rebuild reduced the locomotive's overall weight to , with on the drivers. T. D. Judah was sold to the Wellington Colliery Company on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, where it found service as Wellington Colliery Railway's Queen Anne. It was subsequently scrapped in 1912.  In popular culture In the 1991 film The Little Engine that Could, Tillie and Jebediah are based on this engine but are portrayed as 4-2-2 tank engines.

Unlike Cranchiinae , the other subfamily within Cranchiidae , Taoniinae all lack cartilaginous strips which extend back from the funnel-mantle point of fusion. Their funnels are free laterally, and they have one to three photophores on the eyes. The largest photophore is crescent-shaped for most genera, but it's triangular in Helicocranchia, a semicircle in Bathothauma, and circular in Sandalops. This is in contrast to glass squids in the subfamily Cranchiinae, which have at least four small photophores which are round or oval in shape. In addition, males lack hectocotyli; these are arms which have evolved to specialize in storage and transfer of spermatophores to females. Taoniinae are also often larger than Cranchiinae and have darker beaks. Another characteristic is that a Taoniinae's caecum, is smaller than its stomach; in Cranchiinae, the caecum is larger than the stomach. Taxonomic history and synonyms When Georg Johann Pfeffer circumscribed this subfamily in 1912, he grouped its genera into three tribes: * Taonius-like Taoniinae ** Phasmatopsis ** Toxeuma ** Taonius ** Desmoteuthis ** Megalocranchia ** Taonidium ** Crystalloteuthis ** Phasmatoteuthion ** Galiteuthis ** Corynomma * Teuthowenia-like Taoniinae ** Teuthowenia * Bathothauma-like Taoniinae ** Bathothauma Synonyms of Taoniinae include Galiteuthinae and Teuthoweniinae . S. Stillman Berry's 1912 circumscription of the subfamily Galiteuthinae only consisted of its type genus Galiteuthis . Like Pfeffer's Taoniinae, this was a subfamily within the family Cranchiidae . This was in contrast to Louis Joubin's classification, which placed Galiteuthis in a new, distinct family: Cranchionychiae . Georg Grimpe's 1922 circumscription of Teuthoweniinae included its type genus Teuthowenia as well as Hensenioteuthis , Helicocranchia , and Sandalops . He placed the genus Bathothauma into a new family, Bathothaumatidae , now just treated as a junior synonym of Cranchiidae. Subsequent research did not pay much heed to Grimpe's taxonomy. Phylogeny Below is Nancy A. Voss and Robert S. Voss's 1983 proposal for a phylogeny of the Taoniinae subfamily. Genera and species Taonius borealis Taonius pavo , the World Register of Marine Species classifies the Taoniinae as containing ten genera; they classify Belonella as a synonym of Taonius following Nancy A. Voss. However, Patrizia Jereb and Clyde F. E. Roper recognize Belonella as a distinct genus from Taonius, although they also note they are a frequently synonymized. Jereb and Roper also note Kir Nazimovich Nesis and Takashi Okutani as teuthologists who rejected Voss's synonymization of Belonella. Nesis's classification had Taonius consisting of only the single species T. pavo, and had Belonella consisting of B. belone , B. borealis and an undescribed species from the Antarctic. *Genus Bathothauma **Bathothauma lyromma *Genus Egea **Egea inermis *Genus Galiteuthis **Galiteuthis armata , armed cranch squid **Galiteuthis glacialis **Galiteuthis pacifica **Galiteuthis phyllura **Galiteuthis suhmi *Genus Helicocranchia **Helicocranchia joubini **Helicocranchia papillata **Helicocranchia pfefferi *Genus Liguriella **Liguriella podophthalma *Genus Megalocranchia **Megalocranchia fisheri **Megalocranchia maxima **Megalocranchia oceanica *Genus Mesonychoteuthis **Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, colossal squid or Antarctic cranch squid *Genus Sandalops **Sandalops melancholicus , sandal-eyed equid *Genus Taonius **Taonius borealis **Taonius pavo **Taonius belone *Genus Teuthowenia **Teuthowenia maculata **Teuthowenia megalops , Atlantic cranch squid **Teuthowenia pellucida , googly-eyed glass squid Notes References External links * * Category:Squid Category:Taxa named by Georg Johann Pfeffer ","title":"Taoniinae"},{"id":"5697654","text":"Ohannes Tun√ßboyacƒ±, better known as Onno Tun√ß (December 20, 1948 ‚Äì January 14, 1996), was a leading Armenian-Turkish musician, working mainly as a composer and an arranger. Tun√ß also played bass guitar and occasionally double bass, contributing to the albums of several musicians. He was the elder brother of musician Arto Tun√ßboyacƒ±yan. Early years  Of Armenian descent, Onno Tun√ß was born in 1948 in Istanbul. His music experience started with the church choir of Harur Mangaz (Hundred students). In his first year of middle school, he had to drop out to go to work to support his family. Born in a financially limited family, he could not afford a musical instrument although they fascinated him, until Anush (\\"Sweet\\" in Armenian), the mother of his friend Arman bought her son a guitar, and one for Onno too. Onno, a fast-learning autodidact, started a music band and soon repaid Anush.  Career  He composed 175 songs and represented Turkey in many European music contests. A very close friend of Turkish singer Sezen Aksu, he co-wrote and composed many of the songs she performed throughout her career, as well as arranging all of her albums. It was widely known that his death tipped Sezen Aksu into depression. She dedicated her album D√º≈ü Bah√ßeleri to Onno (and numerous songs on virtually all of her albums since). His symphony Su was performed by the Istanbul Symphony Orchestra. He collaborated with Hulki Aktun√ß and Daƒühan Baydur on the Turkish entry Sevince at the Eurovision Song Contest 1978, which was performed by Nil√ºfer and Nazar. In the 80's, he had a relationship with singer-songwriter Sezen Aksu that was both romantic and professional. As a couple they put their signatures to works that broke new ground in Turkish pop music, such as Sen Aƒülama (Don't Cry), Git (Go), Sezen Aksu'88 and Sezen Aksu S√∂yl√ºyor (Sezen Aksu Sings). Sezen's music matured in the 90's, when she co- produced her best selling album to-date G√ºl√ºmse (Smile) with Onno. The A-1 track from the album called Hadi Bakalƒ±m (Come On Now) was a hit in Turkey and Europe, and was published as a single in Germany. It was to be later rediscovered in Europop by singer Loona as Rhythm of the Night. She also began to produce albums for her vocalists, notably producing A≈ükƒ±n Nur Yengi's debut album Sevgiliye (To a Lover) again with Tun√ß. She was to repeat her success with artists Erener and Y√ºksel also. Onno's younger brother Arto Tun√ßboyacƒ±yan worked with him musically for 25 years. Arto is highly inspired by his brother, having dedicated numerous songs to him (and the mountain that caused Onno's accident) and an album \\"Onno\\" (1996), together with Ara Dinkjian. On performances, you can often read the letters O N N O on Arto's clothing.  Death  Onno Tun√ß died on January 14, 1996, when his private plane he was piloting crashed in bad weather on a mountain at Tazdaƒü near Selimiye village of Armutlu, Yalova on his journey from Bursa to ƒ∞stanbul. Hasan Kanƒ±k, his friend aboard also died in the accident. Onno Tun√ß is buried in ≈ûi≈üli Armenian Catholic Cemetery in ƒ∞stanbul. He was survived by two daughters Selin and Ayda from his first wife, Canan Ate≈ü. In 2002, a monument was erected in his memory at the crash site and in the city center of Yalova. The monument to the composer of Armenian origin was subjected to numerous vandalism over the course of the years. In 2012 Yalova City Hall completely disassembled the monument as the city council decided that the old monument was not architecturally great enough for much valued composer. The city council decided to tear down the old one and build newer and more artistic monument instead.Turkish municipality destroys monument of Armenian musician, composer, News.am, 2012Monument to Armenian musician Onno Tunc destroyed in Turkey, 2012Onno Tun√ß anƒ±tƒ±nƒ± yƒ±ktƒ±k √ß√ºnk√º..., Sabah, 2012 = Onno Tun√ß tribute = In 2007, several renowned Turkish singers and pop groups came together and released a compilation album Onno Tun√ß ≈ûarkƒ±larƒ± (\\"Onno Tun√ß Songs\\").

The roller coaster, designed by S&S; Arrow, is a \\"4th Dimension\\" coaster, a design in which the seats can rotate forward or backward 360 degrees in a controlled spin. This is achieved by having four rails on the track: two of these are running rails while the other two are for spin control. The two rails that control the spin of the seats move up and down relative to the track and spin the seats using a rack and pinion gear mechanism. Eejanaika has the second \\"„Åà\\" turned upside down for the roller coaster's official spelling. Eejanaika has several meanings, but means \\"Ain't it great!\\" According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Eejanaika is the roller coaster with the most inversions in the world with 14, although The Smiler at Alton Towers has 14 inversions also.

He first appeared in Birds of Prey #6 (June 1999), and was created by Chuck Dixon and Greg Land. Fictional character biography A Parademon from the domain of Darkseid, Pharzoof developed a consciousness and personality of his own. While on Earth he disguised his nature underneath an exoskeleton and trenchcoat. Wishing to lead an uprising, he stole a mother box, using it to bring a variety of Earth's super-villains to Apokolips. =Return to Apokolips= Oracle had received a tip-off that there is a planned breakout on a train carrying several dangerous metahumans to the Slab, and sends Black Canary to try to prevent it. The U.S. Marshals protecting the train are suspicious of Canary, particularly when Catwoman turns up and appears to be on friendly terms with her. Black Canary is 'delighted' to learn that Joe Gardner is one of the prisoners on the train, and is unable to prevent the whole company being swallowed up by a boom tube summoned by a strange guy in a trenchcoat. Not knowing where else to turn, Oracle contacts Power Girl to try and trace Black Canary. The train crashes at the other end of the boom tube, killing one of the US Marshals protecting the consignment of super-villains. They have arrived on Apokolips and come under attack almost immediately. The trenchcoat guy who has been proving to be a pain in Black Canary and Oracle's side offers them a deal - release the super-villains to him, and he will return them safely back home - a US Marshal refuses the deal and guns him down. He survives, however, since all that was destroyed is an exo-skeleton he was wearing. Back on Earth, Power Girl and Oracle come to the conclusion that there's little they can do for Canary other than hope. The US Marshals are obliged to release the villains in order to stand a chance against the attacking parademons, as Black Canary and Catwoman follow the 'person' who brought them to Apokolips, who turns out to be the smallest parademon ever seen - and whose mother box has been totally trashed... stranding them all on the hell planet. Black Canary confronts the runt parademon, Pharzoof, who is responsible for bringing her, Catwoman and a trainload of super-villains guarded by the US Marshals to Apokolips. He tells them a tale of woe: how he was left to starve as a 'child', yet somehow survived and developed a personality, unique among parademons. He wanted to take over Apokolips with the help of the super-villains from Earth, but at the moment, Black Canary and Catwoman are more interested in finding a mother box and getting home. The US Marshals fight off an army of parademons and assorted other nasties, assisted by the villains, notably Joe Gardner and Shrapnel. Meanwhile, Black Canary and Pharzoof pursue a mother box, Catwoman being slightly distracted by the Apokoliptian diamond mines. Canary successfully locates a mother box but comes under attack from Lashina of the Female Furies. Luckily for her, there are only so many diamonds even Catwoman can carry, and the two are able to fend her off, get back to the Marshals and use the boom tube to head for Earth, leaving Pharzoof behind to face the wrath of an entire Apokoliptian army. Returning to Earth, they are greeted by the rest of the US Marshals and Power Girl, who are able to contain the super-villains due to the threat of being returned to Apokolips if they don't behave. Powers and abilities * Typical abilities of a parademon include heightened strength and a high tolerance for pain. Apokaliptian armor grant them the ability of flight. * As opposed to most parademons, Pharzoof can speak, and seems to have more than the rudimentary intelligence most parademons possess.

He made the first LP of slack key instrumentals, co-wrote the second slack key instruction book, and composed a number of pieces that have become part of the standard repertory. Most players will include Kwan, along with Gabby Pahinui, Sonny Chillingworth, and Atta Isaacs, on a list of the most significant players of the older generation. Early life Leonard Keala Kwan Sr, was born in Honolulu, Oahu in 1931. His mother, Rose Hauoli, and her father, Reverend Ambrose Hauoli Kau-a, sang traditional Hawaiian music. He learned piano, and was taught to play ukulele and ki ho'alu (traditional slack key guitar styles) by his grandfather and his Uncle Pete Hauoli. He played alto saxophone and string bass in the Kalakaua Intermediate School and Farrington High School dance bands, and substituted in Musicians' Union bands during WW II. By the age of sixteen, he was working for Charlie Kaniyama & His Merry Melodeers and filling-in with other small combos. Career He made his first single record, \\"Hawaiian Chimes,\\" for Island Recording Studio in 1957. He was noticed by Margaret Williams, the owner of Tradewinds Records, who recorded Kwan in her living room. The result, in 1958, was Kwan's first Tradewinds single, the original instrumental \\"Opihi Moemoe,\\" which would become his signature piece and a standard tune in the slack key repertory. In 1960, Tradewinds released an LP of Kwan's playing, titled simply Slack Key, that included six of his own compositions, including \\"Opihi Moemoe.\\" It was the first album to consist entirely of slack key instrumentals. A later Tradewinds album that is made up of tracks by Kwan and Raymond KƒÅne bears the same title, so they are often identified by the colors of their covers: the \\"red album\\" (Kwan) and the \\"black and white album\\" (Kwan and KƒÅne). Other tracks featuring Kwan as soloist or sideman were released on two early-1960s Tradewinds compilations, Party Songs Hawaiian Style, Volumes 1 and 2. Pioneer/Teacher Kwan was also a pioneer in disseminating information about how to play slack key. In his youth, techniques, tunings, and even some songs were not freely exchanged but considered family secrets‚Äîone learned from family members and did not share with outsiders. There was some loosening of this attitude in the 1960s, and by the 1970s the old secrecy was rapidly disappearing, and in 1975 Kwan was the first player to publish the tunings he used on a recording, on the sleeve notes to The Old Way, which also included a transcription of the new version of \\"Opihi Moemoe\\" that was on the album. In 1980, Kwan and collaborator Dennis Ladd followed Keola Beamer, who in 1973 had published the first how-to book for the tradition (First Method for Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar) by producing Slack Key Instruction Book, which presents ten of Kwan's compositions and arrangements in a range of tunings, in standard notation and tablature, with performance notes and photographs of correct left-hand positions for the chords. Although Kwan's reputation rests on his guitar playing, for much of his life as a working musician he played string bass in big bands, and this may account for the elements of swing and jazz that flavor his compositions. Later years By 1980, ill health forced Kwan to retire from active gigging, but in the late 1980s George Winston persuaded Kwan to record again for his Dancing Cat label. The result was Keala's Mele (1995), the first recording to feature Kwan on acoustic guitar and the first to include (on one track) his singing. In 2003, Kwan's Island Recording Studio single and all of his tracks for Tradewinds were reissued on CD as The Legendary Leonard Kwan: The Complete Early Recordings, with discography, tunings, photos, and extensive notes. Leonard Kwan died on August 13, 2000.

In 2001, the 210-room luxury Inn on Biltmore Estate opened. Antler Hill Village, with shops and a restaurant, opened in 2010 and is owned by the 209-room Village Hotel on Biltmore Estate. George Washington Vanderbilt II first opened the Vanderbilt Estate in 1895. This six-year project was a grand production, with grounds designed by landscaper Frederick Law Olmsted and the house designed by Richard Morris Hunt. The Biltmore Company is and always has been family owned and operated, with a goal of supporting and maintaining the estate and various industries affiliated with the estate. In 1889 George Vanderbilt and wife Edith Vanderbilt purchased a nearby town, renamed Biltmore Village. This is where employees of the estate resided. Additionally, the couple created and funded the Biltmore Estate Industries which developed a system of teaching traditional craft making. However, after George‚Äôs death both Biltmore Village and Biltmore Estate Industries were sold in an effort to keep focus on the Estate itself. The Biltmore Company was started in 1933 and divided between William Cecil Jr. and his brother George Cecil in the late 1970s. George Cecil's company, called Biltmore Farms, focused on development, including Biltmore Park. George and Edith Vanderbilt were very environmentally conscious, and they sold over 86,000 acres of the surrounding land to the government to create the Pisgah National Forest. The Biltmore Company still values the importance of forest preservation and utilizes techniques to ensure preservation of the soil, water, wildlife and forest of the area. Today, the Biltmore Company is still run by the descendants of George Vanderbilt; the President and CEO is currently William Cecil Jr. The Biltmore Company employs over 2,400 people who maintain the 8,000 acres of the Biltmore Estate, hotel, winery, restaurants and shops.

Despite its rarity, it is believed to be the only surviving species in the genus Hibiscadelphus which is only known from Hawaii, the other five species having recently become extinct in the wild, some being known from only a single plant. Description Hibiscadelphus distans is a shrub or small tree up to tall with smooth bark and a rounded crown. The heart-shaped leaves are in length and have rounded serrations on the margins and stellate trichomes (star-shaped hairs) on the upper on lower surfaces. The flowers are long and surrounded by triangular bracts. The sepals form a calyx tube around the greenish yellow petals, which turn maroon as they age. The fruit is a long, wide capsule that is divided into five sections. Each section contains two seeds around long. The capsule dehisces when mature, releasing the seeds. Habitat Hau kuahiwi is found within low to mid-elevations, between in highly degraded remnants of native dry forests. The substrate is basaltic bedrock overlain by dry, crumbly red- brown soil. The current population exists in the Lower Koaie Canyon, a tributary of Waimea Canyon, at an elevation of roughly . Mean temperature in this habitat ranges from and average annual rainfall is . Associated plants include kukui (Aleurites moluccana), ƒÅhinahina (Artemisia kauaiensis), alahee (Psydrax odorata), lama (Diospyros sandwicensis), nehe (Lipochaeta connata), k≈çlea (Myrsine spp.), kuluƒ´ (Nototrichium sandwicense), ƒÅlaa (Pouteria sandwicensis), Sacramento Bur (Triumfetta semitriloba) and ƒÅulu (Sapindus oahuensis). Conservation There are only two known naturally occurring populations of H. distans, both in the Lower Koaie Canyon area, Puu Ka Pele Forest Reserve, with an estimated 20 wild and 150 reintroduced trees. The original population, found in 1972, was located in Koaie Canyon within the State-owned NƒÅ Pali Kona Forest Reserve. In 1989, this population was destroyed by a landslide. A second population of fifty trees in the Hipalau Valley was destroyed in 1992 by Hurricane Iniki. Two botanical gardens in Hawaii have cultivated this plant species: McBryde Garden (National Tropical Botanical Garden) on Kauai and Waimea Valley on Oahu. Despite the extreme rarity of H. distans, it actually has the largest wild population of any Hibiscadelphus species. Five of the other six species are extinct or extinct in the wild (four were only ever known from a single wild tree), the exception being H. woodii (also from Kauai), which is known from only four individuals.

H. Wattis (August 15, 1859 - September 13, 1931), was one of the three Wattis Brothers who founded Utah Construction Company in 1900. History Wattis was born in Uinta, Utah Territory, the fourth of seven children born to Edmund Orson Wattis and Mary Jane Corey. With his brother E.O., he formed a firm to lay track for the expanding railroads. The fledgling Wattis Brothers firm was wiped out in the panic of 1893. While William continued to try to find construction projects, Edmund focused his energies on running a sheep ranch the brothers had established in the Weber Valley. This ranch and others would later provide the financial strength for the large construction projects to come. Wattis married his sweetheart, Anna Maria Dorothea Sophie (Marie) Stander, on January 9, 1889. They had three daughters and one son. In 1897, they lost Florence Louise, age 5, and Edmund (Teddy), age 1, within six months of each other while living in Astoria, Oregon. Utah Construction Company In 1900, the Wattis Brothers (E.O., W.H. and Warren L.) again attempted to be partners in contracting. They founded the Utah Construction Company along with David Eccles and Thomas D. Dee. A short four years after its founding, Utah Construction Company was awarded the contract to build the Feather River route between Oakland and Salt Lake City. This $60 million contract was challenging, but after five years, very profitable. The Feather River route was complete for the Western Pacific Railroad in 1911. The Utah Construction Company also was a building contractor for the Utah State Capital. In 1912, after the death of David Eccles, W. H. was elected President of The Utah Construction Company. The company thrived, and soon captured a large share of the tunneling, grading, and track projects in the rapidly expanding railroads in the mountain west. Seeing the end of railroad expansion, the Wattis Brothers looked for ways to diversify their construction risks. Wattis Coal Company In 1915, the Wattis brothers bought the Wattis Coal Company (160 acres from the federal government) and the Wattis mine shipped its first coal on April 11, 1918. The ghost town of Wattis, Utah, located south of Price, is named after the Wattis brothers. In 1919 the company merged with the Lion Coal Company, owned by the Eccles family. Ogden Union Stockyard Company On July 29, 1916, W.H. formed a partnership in incorporating the Ogden Union Stockyard Company (opened for business April 1, 1917), formerly known as the Ogden Packing and Provision Company, which proved to be quite profitable‚Äîby 1934 the company made over $2 million.Pate, J'Nell L. America‚Äôs Historic Stockyards, Livestock Hotels, pg. 146, 162 Building dams In 1917, Utah Construction Company was awarded the $7 million O'Shaughnessy Dam contract, a controversial project that impounds the Tuolumne River in the Hetch Hetchy Valley of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Success with the O'Shaughnessy Dam convinced the Wattis Brothers to bid on more dam projects. In 1922, Utah Construction Company formed a partnership with the Morrison-Knudsen Company of Boise, Idaho. With Frank Crowe as the chief engineer, the MK UC partnership successfully built dams throughout the American west. Politics and committees In 1918, W.H. was nominated by the Republican Party to run for the United States Congress. He also ran unsuccessfully for governor of Utah in 1928. He was appointed to the Flood Relief Committee by Governor Mabey on August 17, 1923,Davis County Clipper, pg. 1 and appointed to the Christmas Seal Sale Advisory Committee in 1924.Davis County Clipper, November 14, 1924, pg. 4 Other businesses W.H. was also a prominent businessman in Ogden, Utah and known throughout Utah. He was director of The National Bank, director of the Utah-Idaho Central Railroad, and president of Dee Memorial Hospital from 1917 to 1929. As president he oversaw the new L-shaped addition equipped with elevators, making Dee one of the most modern and up-to-date hospitals of its time at an estimated cost of $160,000. In January 1921, Wattis was elected general manager and president of Utah-Idaho Sugar Company and vice president and general manager of the Canadian Sugar Company Ltd., the Canadian branch of Utah-Idaho Sugar Company.Davis County Clipper, October 16, 1925, p. 2 Due to political and legal troubles with the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, Wattis was indicted on price fixing charges and was found in contempt of court by Judge Tilman D. Johnson, which caused him to withdraw from a 1920 run for governor. He was elected Captain of the Alta Club, one of the oldest gentlemen's clubs in Utah, on April 22, 1921. On September 27, 1927, Wattis was nominated and elected Vice President of the Associated General Contractors of America, and later nominated on October 20, 1927 to be the vice president over the states of Utah, Nevada, California and Arizona. In 1929, the Wattis Brothers spearheaded the formation of Six Companies to build the Hoover Dam, which was the largest construction project ever tackled by the US Government up to that time. W.H. was elected as the Six Companies' first President. Death On March 23, 1931, Time Magazine wrote: However, he did not live to see Hoover Dam completed; W.H. Wattis died in California, on September 13, 1931 of cancer. Shortly before his death on June 9, 1931, the University of Utah honored him with a Doctorate of Law degree. Wattis loved life, family and friends. He was an avid golfer, hunter and traveler. References Sources *Alta Club Photograph Collection, box 3, 235 W.H.

It was directed by John Ford and shot on location in Monument Valley, Utah. The film starred Strode as a black first sergeant in the United States Cavalry accused of the rape and murder of a white girl at a U.S. Army fort in the early 1880s.Ford's use of the 9th was in error. At the time of the story, with Gen. Nelson A. Miles in command, the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th U.S. Cavalry served in Arizona. The 9th Cavalry was stationed in West Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, and Nebraska, but never Arizona. This was Billie Burke's final film role. Plot The film revolves around the court- martial of 1st Sgt. Braxton Rutledge (Strode), a \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" of the 9th U.S. Cavalry, in 1881. His defense is handled by Lt. Tom Cantrell (Hunter), Rutledge's troop officer. The story is told through a series of flashbacks, expanding the testimony of witnesses as they describe the events following the murder of Rutledge's Commanding Officer, Major Dabney, and the rape and murder of Dabney's daughter, for which Rutledge is the accused. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the first sergeant raped and murdered the girl and then killed his commanding officer. Worse still, Rutledge deserts after the killings. Ultimately, he is tracked down and arrested by Lt. Cantrell. At one point, Rutledge escapes from captivity during an Indian raid, but later, he voluntarily returns to warn his fellow cavalrymen that they are about to face an ambush, thus saving the troop. He is then brought back in to face the charges and the prejudices of an all-white military court. Eventually he is found not guilty of the rape and murder of the girl when a local white man breaks down under questioning and admits that he raped and murdered the girl. Production Parts of the film were shot in Monument Valley and the San Juan River at Mexican Hat in Utah.

Reception Black Classic Movies mentions that this is one of the few American films of the 1960s to have a Black man in a leading role and the first mainstream western to do so.Sergeant Rutledge All Movie gave it four out of five stars and mentioned \\" the expressionistic use of light and color, particularly during Rutledge's encounter with a sympathetic female witness, points to the repressed sexual terror that drives the case against him\\" and praised Strode's performance.Sergeant Rutledge (1960) Chicago Reader considered the film to be \\"effective\\", but \\"slightly long\\" and mentioned that it is \\"one of Ford's late efforts to treat minority members with more respect than westerns usually did\\".Sergeant Rutledge Time Out agreed that the film is \\"often pigeonholed as one of Ford's late trio of guiltily amends-making movies\\" and although it praised it, it concluded that \\"he can't confront the cultural fear of miscegenation that mechanises [the movie], only its distorted expression.\\"Sergeant Rutledge In an anthology presenting Ford's movies, the film was described as being one of his best, but also one of his most underrated.

It was first published in 1968 and translated into English by Michael Kandel in 1983. It is a densely philosophical first contact story about an effort by scientists to decode, translate and understand an extraterrestrial transmission. The novel critically approaches humanity's intelligence and intentions in deciphering and truly comprehending a message from outer space. It is considered to be one of the three best-known books by Lem, the other two being Solaris and The Cyberiad.  Plot  The novel is written as a first- person narrative, the memoir of a mathematician named Peter Hogarth, who becomes involved in a Pentagon-directed project (code-named \\"His Master's Voice\\", or HMV for shortNote: Project HMV in Polish original is named MAVO, for \\"Master's Voice\\", rather than \\"His Master's Voice\\"\\") in the Nevada desert, where scientists are working to decode what seems to be a message from outer space (specifically, a neutrino signal from the Canis Minor constellation). Throughout the book Hogarth‚Äîor rather, Lem himself‚Äîexposes the reader to many debates merging cosmology and philosophy: from discussions of epistemology, systems theory, information theory and probability, through the idea of evolutionary biology and the possible form and motives of extraterrestrial intelligence, with digressions about ethics in military-sponsored research, to the limitations of human science constrained by the human nature subconsciously projecting itself into the analysis of any unknown subject. At some point one of the involved scientists (Rappaport), desperate for new ideas, even begins to read and discuss popular science-fiction stories, and Lem uses this opportunity to criticize the science fiction genre, as Rappaport soon becomes bored and disillusioned by monotonous plots and the unimaginative stories of pulp magazines. Brazilian edition cover. Before Hogarth's arrival, the scientists were able to use part of the data to synthesize a substance with unusual properties. Two variations had been created: a glutinous liquid nicknamed \\"Frog Eggs\\", and a more solid version that looks like a slab of red meat called \\"Lord of the Flies\\" (named for its strange agitating effect on insects brought into proximity with it, rather than for the allegorical meaning of the name). There is some speculation that the signal may actually be a genome and that \\"Frog Eggs\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" may be a form of protoplasm; possibly that of the alien creatures that presumably sent the signal. This theory, like all the project's theories about the signal, turns out to be unverifiable. For a short time, Hogarth suspects that the message may have a military use, and is faced with an ethical dilemma about whether and how to pursue this angle. \\"Frog eggs\\" seems to enable a teleportation of an atomic blast at the speed of light to a remote location, which would make deterrence impossible. Hogarth and the discoverer of the effect decide to conduct further research in secret before notifying the military. Eventually, they conclude that there is no military use after all (which Hogarth sees as a proof of the Senders' far-sightedness), since the uncertainty of the blast location increases with distance. The two scientists face ostracism from their colleagues, some of whom consider their conduct unpatriotic. Some of the scientists pursue a theory that the neutrino signal might have had the effect of increasing the likelihood that life would develop on the planet eons ago. They are forced to consider whether alien beings sent the signal for this very reason. In the end, they find no certain answers. There is much speculation about the nature of whatever alien beings might have sent the signal. They must have been technologically superior, but no one can be sure whether they were virtuous or evil. Indeed, as the signal must have been sent long ago, no one can be sure whether they still exist. The theories the scientists come up with all seem to make some progress toward deciphering the signal; however, as is stated in the few first pages of Hogarth's memoirs, for all their efforts, the scientists are left with few new, real discoveries. By the time the project is ended, they are no more sure than they were in the beginning about whether the signal was a message from intelligent beings that humanity failed to decipher, or a poorly understood natural phenomenon. In the end, the many theories about the signal and the beings who might have sent it say more about the scientists (and humanity) than about the signal (and the beings who might have sent it). The comparison between the signal and a Rorschach test is made more than once. Literary criticism Dave Langford reviewed His Master's Voice for White Dwarf #49, and stated that \\"Lem offers a sheaf of cosmic answers, some truly mindblowing ‚Äì but it isn't easy reading.\\" The book can be viewed on many levels: as part of the social science fiction genre criticizing Cold War military and political decision-making as corrupting the ethical conduct of scientists; as a psychological and philosophical essay on the limitations of the human mind facing the unknown; or as a satire of \\"men of science\\" and their thinking. The critique of the idea of 'pure science' is also a critique of the positivist approach: Lem argues that no scientist can be detached from the pressures of the outside world. The book is deeply philosophical, and there is relatively little action; most of the book consists of philosophical essays, monologues and dialogues. Lem's similar books exploring the issues of first contact are Eden, Solaris, The Invincible and Fiasco. His Master's Voice, however, is one of Lem's more philosophical books.

Depending on the type of beer used, it may or may not contribute leavening to the baking process. Thus, beer breads range from heavy, unleavened, loaves to light breads and rolls incorporating baker's yeast. The flavor of beer bread is sometimes enhanced with other flavors, such as cheese or herbs.  Description  Beer bread can be a simple quick bread or a yeast bread flavored with beer. Beer and bread have a common creation process: yeast is used to turn sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol. In the case of bread, a great percentage of the alcohol evaporates during the baking process. Beer bread can be made simply with flour, beer, and sugar. Some bottled beers‚Äîespecially craft beers‚Äîmay intentionally have visible dormant, but live, yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, many mass-market beers have the live yeast filtered out. Without sufficient leavening from the beer, a loaf of beer bread will be fairly dense and heavy unless an additional leavening agent (e.g., baking soda or baking powder, or baker's yeast and sugar) is added. Self- raising flour may be used because it is a mixture of flour and leavening agent. Beer bread made without a leavening agent is very sturdy, but tends not to lose moisture when cooked for a long time; lengthier cooking tends to produce a thicker crust. Pre-packaged beer bread mixes, with the dry ingredients and leavening agents already included, are available to purchase. Different styles of beer bread can be made by using different beers; for instance, a stout or dark beer will give a darker bread with more pronounced flavor. Using a beer that is spiced, or has a flavor added, will make a bread with a similar flavor, but less intense than the beer. Any number of additional flavorings may be used to enhance the flavor of beer bread. They include cheddar and dill, sun-dried tomato and herb, garlic and feta, etc., added to the mix of dry ingredients. One consideration when choosing flavors is that if the beer bread is not going to be eaten straight away then the flavors will become enhanced upon storage.

They frequently appear in ghost stories and miscellaneous writings from the Edo Period as well as in modern folk customs. In Yamaguchi Prefecture and Saga Prefecture, they are called Ayakashi. Legends Funay≈´rei are ghosts believed to use hishaku (ladles) to fill boats with water and make them sink. They are said to be the remnants of people who have died in shipwrecks and are attempting to cause humans to join them. According to legends, there are various methods that can be used to protect from the harm they inflict, such as throwing onigiri into the sea or preparing a hishaku with its bottom missing.

They often appear in rainy days, as well as nights on a new or full moon, and on stormy nights and foggy nights. When it appears as a boat, the funay≈´rei itself glows with light, so that it is possible to confirm its details even at night. Also, by operating on the sixteenth day of Bon, the dead would attempt to approach the side of the ship and sink it. Also, on a very foggy evening, by making the boat attempt to run, a cliff or a boat without a pulley would appear, and since getting startled and attempting to avoid it would result in capsizing and getting stranded on a reef, it would be no problem to simply push on forward, making it disappear naturally. Other than attempting to sink ships, in the town of ≈åtsuki, Hata District Kochi Prefecture, they are said to make the boat's compass malfunction, and in the Toyoma Prefecture, fishing boats that travel to Hokkaido get turned into a funayurei, causing the crew to hang themselves. In Ehime Prefecture, when one encounters a funayurei, if one tries to avoid it by changing the boat's route, the boat runs aground. Also, in the past, to avoid shipwrecks firing bad weather, people would light a bonfire on land. However, a funayurei would light a fire on open sea and mislead the boatmen, and by approaching the fire, one would get eaten by the sea and drown. There are also various legends about how to drive away funayurei depending on the area, and in the Miyagi Prefecture, when a funayurei appears, they would disappear if one stops the ship and stares fixedly at the funayurei for a while. It is also told that it is good to stir up the water with a stick. There are also various theories that it would be good to throw things into the sea, and in K≈çzu-shima, it would be flowers and incense, incense sticks, dango, washed rice, and water, in Kochi Prefecture, it would be ashes and 49 rice cakes, and in Otsuki, Kochi, it would be summer beans, in Nagasaki Prefecture, it would be woven mats, ashes, and burnt firewood. Also, in Kochi Prefecture, it is said to be possible to drive funayurei by saying \\"I am Dozaemon („Çè„Åó„ÅØÂúüÂ∑¶Ë°õÈñÄ„Å†)\\" and asserting to be one of the funayurei. In Ehime, one is able to disperse the funayurei by lighting a match and throwing it. Classics \\"Funay≈´rei\\" from the Ehon Hyaku Monogatari by Takehara Shunsen In the collection of fantastic stories, the Ehon Hyaku Monogatari from the Edo period, the funayurei that appear on the western sea are departed souls from the Taira clan. It is known that the Taira clan came to ruin in the Battle of Dan-no-ura, but in the open sea between Dan no Ura and Mekari in the Kanmon Straits (Hayamoto, Êó©ÈûÜ), a funayurei wearing armor and helmet would appear, say \\"give me a bucket\\", and would cling to the boat. By lending a hishaku, it would pour water onto the boat, so when crossing this sea on a boat, one would thus prepare one with its bottom open, and thus stave off the funayurei. Once, there was a Buddhist priest who, feeling pity for the spirit, performed a rite, causing it to go away. Genrin Yamaoka, an intellectual from the Edo period, commented on funayurei that appear as balls of fire or ghosts at sea. Referring to Zhu Xi and the Cheng-Zhu school, he brought up several examples of departed souls that died with resentment and remained even after carrying out their revenge, and concluded, \\"even by seeing something from 10 people, by sometimes going along with reason, you can also sometimes see it in ancient Chinese books („Åã„ÇÑ„ÅÜ„ÅÆ‰∫ã„Å§„Å≠„Å´ÂçÅ‰∫∫„Å™„Åø„Å´„ÅÇ„Çã„Åì„Å®„Å´„ÅØÂæÖ„Çâ„Å≠„Å©„ÇÇ„ÄÅ„Åü„Åæ„Åü„Åæ„ÅØ„ÅÇ„ÇãÈÅìÁêÜ„Å´„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅ„ÇÇ„Çç„Åì„Åó„ÅÆÊõ∏„Å´„ÇÇ„Åä„Çä„Åä„ÇäË¶ã„ÅàÂæÖ„Çã)\\". Although it is not possible to get a hold of smoke with one's hands, by accumulating it and staining one's hand, it is possible to take it into one's hands. The spirit (Ê∞ó, ki) is the beginning of one's nature, and when the spirit stagnates, the ones that create a form and produce a voice are called yurei. In the first place, the stagnated spirits of the ghosts desire to fall, and disappear. Modern examples In 1954, after the Toya Maru accident, the largest marine accident to occur after the war, the ferryboats that went on commission after the accident were discovered to have a strange scar on their propeller, providing an example of where rumors started to spread about how the victims of the accident turned into funayurei and dug claws into the propellers. This funayurei appears in sea and on land, and in Nanaehama, Hokkaido, there is a rumor that at midnight, a female would appear completely wet riding in a taxi, who would disappear once one reaches the destination, and who was rumored to be the ghost of Toya Maru. Also, in Aomori Station, the staff members who slept in the night duty room would wake up at the sound of banging on the glass window, and would see the hand of the completely wet female on the other side, got startled that \\"Toya Maru's victims were pleading for help,\\" and the next morning, there would be a promissory note remaining on that glass window. Also, in 1969, in the sea in Kanagawa Prefecture, one would observe a white human figure, hear a voice saying \\"Please give me a hishaku,\\" and it was said that the shipwrecked members of the university's yacht club were wanting to bail water. From the view of folkloristics According to the folkloristician, Hideo Hanabe, funayurei appear in evenings of wind and rain and heavy fog, and also frequently when the weather suddenly worsens, and since the matter that accidents happen more easily adds a sense of reality, and since they also give a feeling of eeriness and unease, some of the strange incidents would be put into a frame of legends, so that phantoms and illusions would be spoken of as reality. The fact that they often appear during Bon makes its image overlap with that of the sh≈çr≈çbune. However, at its foundation, as ones who are not deified, there is also faith in the spirits of those who have died at sea and float around and turn into funayurei, and in Bon and in New Year's Eve, and other set days, it is forbidden to fish or go to sea, or forbidden to go close to the sea, and a prohibition on breaking these taboos. Theories on their true identity Funayurei are said to possess ships and prevent them from moving, but they have somewhat been given a scientific explanation in the modern era with description of the phenomenon of internal waves causing the nautical effect of dead water. For example, in the area of the ocean that is at the mouth of large rivers, there are areas of water with low salinity, but since water with low salinity is comparatively light, it would stagnate to sea level, but the water on both sides would not move too much, and would form a boundary. Around that boundary, if the boat has a screw propeller, however much one turns it, the energy would merely stir up the water on the boundary, and expended all on creating internal waves, resulting in the boat not moving. In polar regions, ice would melt and float into the middle of sea, creating the same result, which was also recorded by the polar explorer Nansen. In this way, there is a hypothesis that the internal waves accompanied by changes in the salt content, the water temperature, and the hydraulic pressure would obstruct the boat from advancing. By area ;Inadakase :The coast of Fukushima Prefecture. They speak to people on ships, saying \\"lend me an inada (hishaku)\\". An \\"inada\\" is a hishaku that is used on boats, if one doesn't open a hole in it before giving it over, it would suddenly fill the boat with water and cause it to sink. ;The man in white, the beautiful princess :Kowaura, Minamiise, Mie Prefecture. During storms, it would say \\"Lend me a hishaku\\" to boats that were too slow to flee and sink the boat. By lending a hishaku with a hole in it, it is possible to flee and return.Ôºà‚ÄªÈü≥ÈáèÊ≥®ÊÑèÔºâ ;Murasa :Tsumamura, Oki District, Shimane Prefecture (now Okinoshima). Here, what might appear to be noctiluca in the lake is said to be a crystallization of salt, but by staring in there, the thing that spherically solidified while shining is Murasa. By making the boat go over it, the boat would suddenly sink. :Also, there are cases where at night the sea would suddenly shine with light, but this is due to being possessed by Murasa, and it is said that it is effective to attach a sword or knife to the end of a pole and stir the sea several times with it. ;Yobashiri :Aishima, Abu District, Yamaguchi Prefecture (now Hagi). By coiling a white sail and making it run forward, it would also run along. By scattering ashes and making a sound, it would disperse. ;Ugume :Hirado, Nagasaki Prefecture and Goshourajima, Kumamoto Prefecture, among other areas of Kyushu. It is said that when a boat is possessed, it obstructs the boat's movement, and in Hirado, a sail boat would come chasing even though there is no wind. In the western coast of Kyushu, it appears as an illusion of a boat or an island. In order to avoid this, in Hirado, it would be to throw ashes, and in Goshourajima, it would be to say \\"I'm putting down the anchor (Èå®„ÇíÂÖ•„Çå„Çã„Åû)\\" while throwing a stone, and then throwing the anchor. They are also said to disappear if one smokes tobacco. They are also said to appear while saying \\"give me an akadori (Ê∑¶Âèñ„Çä, a scoop for removing water that gathers at the bottom of a ship)\\", and they would sink a ship if one doesn't give them an akadori that has its bottom open. ;Mayoibune :Onga District, Fukuoka Prefecture and in the same prefecture Kanezaki, Munakata. On the evening of moonlight nights around the time of Bon, they appear as sailboats at sea. It is said that atmospheric ghost lights would appear and people's voices could be heard. ;Mouren Yassa (‰∫°Èúä„É§„ÉÉ„Çµ) :Kaij≈ç District, Ch≈çshi city, Chiba Prefecture (now Asahi). On days of deep fog and stormy days, it is a funayurei that would appear to fishing boats, and it is said that a spirit of someone who died in a shipwreck is attempting to increase their fellows. A voice would approach the boat saying \\"mouren, yassa, mouren, yassa, lend me an inaga („É¢„Ç¶„É¨„É≥„ÄÅ„É§„ÉÉ„Çµ„ÄÅ„É¢„Ç¶„É¨„É≥„ÄÅ„É§„ÉÉ„Çµ„ÄÅ„ÅÑ„Å™„ÅåË≤∏„Åõ„Åà)\\", and suddenly a hand would come from the sea, saying \\"give me a hishaku\\", but since it would sink the boat if lent a hishaku, it is said that one should thus give a hishaku with its bottom open. \\"Mouren\\" means ghost, and \\"inaga\\" means a hishaku, and \\"yassa\\" are the encouraging shouts used while rowing a boat. In the works of the yokai manga cartoonist Shigeru Mizuki, it was written as Mourei Yassan (ÁåõÈúäÂÖ´ÊÉ®), and in Sakaiminato, Tottori Prefecture, Mizuki's birthplace, a festival has been opened for calming this Mourei Yassan. ;Misaki („Éü„Çµ„Ç≠) :Appearing in Fukuoka Prefecture among other places, they are seen as a kind of Funayurei. ;Namourei :In the legends of Kosode, Ube town, Kunohe District, Iwate Prefecture, (now Kuji), it is a yokai that appears frequently along with black boats, and they make an impossible demand \\"give me a paddle in times of storms (ÊôÇÂåñ(shike)„ÅÆÊôÇ„Å™„Å©„Å´Ê´Ç(kai)„Çí„Çà„Åì„Åõ)\\", but it would do no good to reply, or lend them a paddle. Similar legends outside Japan *According to the Keirin Manroku (Ê°ÇÊûóÊº´Èå≤) (written in Kansei 12), there are writings such as \\"the ghosts of those who have drowned become ghosts that capsize ships (Ë¶ÜÊ∫∫(fukudeki)„Åó„Å¶Ê≠ª„Åõ„ÇãËÄÖ„ÅÆÈ¨º(ghosts)„ÇíË¶ÜËàüÈ¨º„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®)\\" and \\"they are seen in writings about yokai overseas (Êµ∑Â§ñÊÄ™Â¶ñË®ò„Å´Ë¶ã„Åü„Çä„Å®)\\" stating that what are considered funayurei to the Japanese were also written about in China. In China, there are legends of a phenomenon called \\"Kikokutan no Kai\\" (È¨ºÂì≠ÁÅò„ÅÆÊÄ™), and discolored monsters would attempt to capsize ships (these are close to the umib≈çzu).

Two axes of the image corresponds to vertical and horizontal distance and the third to wavelength. The principle of operation is the same as that of the simple spectrometer, but special care is taken to avoid optical aberrations for better image quality. Example imaging spectrometer types include: filtered camera, whiskbroom scanner, pushbroom scanner, integral field spectrograph (or related dimensional reformatting techniques), wedge imaging spectrometer, Fourier transform imaging spectrometer, computed tomography imaging spectrometer (CTIS), image replicating imaging spectrometer (IRIS), coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI), and image mapping spectrometer (IMS).  Principle  Imaging spectrometers are used specifically for the purpose of measuring the spectral content of light and electromagnetic light. The spectral data gathered is used to give the operator insight into the sources of radiation. Prism spectrometers use a classical method of dispersing radiation by means of a prism as a refracting element. The imaging spectrometer works by imaging a radiation source onto what is called a ‚Äúslit‚Äù by means of a source imager. A collimator collimates the beam that is dispersed by a refracting prism and re-imaged onto a detection system by a re- imager. Special care is taken to produce the best possible image of the source onto the slit. The purpose of the collimator and re-imaging optics are to take the best possible image of the slit. An area-array of elements fills the detection system at this stage. The source image is reimaged, every point, as a line spectrum on what is called a detector-array column. The detector array signals supply data pertaining to spectral content, in particular, spatially resolved source points inside source area. These source points are imaged onto the slit and then re-imaged onto the detector array. Simultaneously, the system provides spectral information about the source area and its line of spatially resolved points. The line is then scanned in order to build a database of information about the spectral content.  Applications  =Planetary observations= The practical application of imaging spectrometers is they are used to observe the planet Earth from orbiting satellites. The spectrometer functions by recording all points of color on a picture, thus, the spectrometer is focused on specific parts of the Earth‚Äôs surface to record data. The advantages of spectral content data include vegetation identification, physical condition analysis, mineral identification for the purpose of potential mining, and the assessment of polluted waters in oceans, coastal zones and inland waterways. Prism spectrometers are ideal for Earth observation because they measure wide spectral ranges competently. Spectrometers can be set to cover a range from 400 nm to 2,500 nm, which interests scientists who are able to observe Earth by means of aircraft and satellite. The spectral resolution of the prism spectrometer is not desirable for most scientific applications; thus, its purpose is specific to recording spectral content of areas with greater spatial variations. Venus express, orbiting Venus, had a number of imaging spectrometers covering NIR-vis-UV.  Disadvantages  The lenses of the prism spectrometer are used for both collimation and re-imaging; however, the imaging spectrometer is limited in its performance by the image quality provided by the collimators and re- imagers. The resolution of the slit image at each wavelength limits spatial resolution; likewise, the resolution of optics across the slit image at each wavelength limits spectral resolution. Moreover, distortion of the slit image at each wavelength can complicate the interpretation of the spectral data. The refracting lenses used in the imaging spectrometer limit performance by the axial chromatic aberrations of the lens. These chromatic aberrations are bad because they create differences in focus, which prevent good resolution; however, if the range is restricted it is possible to achieve good resolution. Furthermore, chromatic aberrations can be corrected by using two or more refracting materials over the full visible range. It is harder to correct chromatic aberrations over wider spectral ranges without further optical complexity.  Systems  Spectrometers intended for very wide spectral ranges are best if made with all-mirror systems. These particular systems have no chromatic aberrations, and that is why they are preferable. On the other hand, spectrometers with single point or linear array detection systems require simpler mirror systems. Spectrometers using area-array detectors need more complex mirror systems to provide good resolution. It is conceivable that a collimator could be made that would prevent all aberrations; however, this design is expensive because it requires the use of aspherical mirrors. Smaller two-mirror systems can correct aberrations, but they are not suited for imaging spectrometers. Three mirror systems are compact and correct aberrations as well, but they require at least two asperical components. Systems with more than four mirrors tend to be large and a lot more complex. Catadioptric systems are used in Imagine Spectrometers and are compact, too; however, the collimator or imager will be made up of two curved mirrors and three refracting elements, and thus, the system is very complex. Optical complexity is unfavorable, however, because effects scatter all optical surfaces and stray reflections. Scattered radiation can interfere with the detector by entering into it and causing errors in recorded spectra. Stray radiation is referred to as stray light. By limiting the total number of surfaces that can contribute to scatter, it limits the introduction of stray light into the equation. Imaging spectrometers are meant to produce well resolved images. In order for this to occur, imaging spectrometers need to be made with few optical surfaces and have no aspherical optical surfaces.

(formerly known as Messenger Plus! Live, commonly abbreviated MsgPlus, Plus!, or incorrectly as MSN Plus) is an add-on for Windows Live Messenger and Skype. The software provides additional functionality to Microsoft's Instant messaging client, Windows Live Messenger, by adding its own controls to the main interface. These controls affect Messenger's behaviour and appearance, often through additional dialog boxes. The add-on was first released in May 2001 under the name \\"The Messenger Plus! Extension\\" for MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger. It later changed its name to \\"Messenger Plus!\\" and then, for the release of the new Windows Live Messenger client, \\"Messenger Plus! Live\\" was chosen. In 2011 the name was changed back to \\"Messenger Plus!\\" again. It has become one of the most widely used add-ons for Microsoft's IM clients, citing over 62 million users as of February 2010. Volunteers from the Messenger Plus! community around the world develop skins and scripts for submission into the database of the website for the software. Features Messenger Plus! generally expands the features of Windows Live Messenger 2009 (9.0) and 2011. Notable features include: *A set of text formatting codes similar to BBCode (people who don't use Messenger Plus! will still see standard unformatted text with the BBCode still in place). *Custom status tags. *Running multiple instances of Windows Live Messenger with different accounts. *Event logging and chat logging in either plain text or HTML with optional encryption. *Chat log viewer. For browsing and searching all saved logs. *Contacts on desktop. Small windows always on top which show a specific contact. *Auto-reply messages, usually activated when away from keyboard. *Emotion sounds. Custom sounds which can be sent to other Messenger Plus! users. *Tabbed chatting (all the conversations in the same window). This feature existed in Messenger Plus! before Windows Live Messenger 2011 added native support for tabbed chatting. *Messenger locking (Boss Mode). *Contact list clean-up. Showing statistics about the user's contacts and allowing him to remove people who removed him or he never talks to. *Skinning Windows Live Messenger without the user having to physically edit the program's resource files. *JScript scripting allowing users to add their own functionality. =Languages= Messenger Plus! is available in 22 languages: *Arabic *Chinese Simplified *Chinese Traditional *Danish *Dutch *English *Estonian *Finnish *French *German *Hebrew *Hungarian *Italian *Japanese *Norwegian *Portuguese- Brazil *Portuguese-Portugal *Russian *Spanish *Swedish *Thai *Turkish Creator Messenger Plus! was originally created in 2001 by Cyril Paciullo, who is better known by the pseudonym \\"Patchou\\". He was born in France and currently resides in Canada. He started developing Plus! as a hobby next to his day job as a developer, but soon maintaining the Messenger Plus! software became a full-time job. In Q4 of 2009 Paciullo announced he is no longer in full control of the product and Messenger Plus! is now owned by Yuna Software Limited. In Q1 of 2011 Paciullo officially declared he had left the company and that this chapter of his professional life was closed. Financial details or names of the people behind the new company are not disclosed. Yuna Software has offices in several places in the world and has an office in Montreal, also known as Kimahri Software, where a development team continued to develop Messenger Plus!. Adware When developing Messenger Plus! became a full-time job, a form of revenue was added to keep the software free. Formerly, the software came bundled with optional adware software developed by Circle Development Ltd. =Issues with Windows Defender= As of August 17, 2005, the Messenger Plus! website contained a petition to Microsoft's anti-spyware division regarding Windows Defender's (known as Microsoft AntiSpyware at the time) detection of the Messenger Plus! executable as spyware and subsequent warning that Messenger Plus! would attempt to install spyware at runtime (post-installation), rather than the setup program itself that contained the installer for the threat detected. The petition, which had 401,683 signatures and was 10,137 pages long in total, was sent to Redmond on September 20, 2005 stating that Messenger Plus! should not be labeled as being a threat. On September 23, 2005, just 3 days after the petition was mailed to Redmond from Canada, Microsoft released new definitions for Windows Defender that fixed the false threat detection affecting the Messenger Plus! executable together with other detection improvements. Recent versions of Windows Defender also stopped detecting the Messenger Plus! installer as being potentially dangerous. =Sponsorship agreement criticism= Some software review websites criticized the user agreement, stating that the 'sponsorship agreement', which authorized the installation of the optional adware software, was misleading because it looked like a standard EULA, and was only available in English. The user does get the option to not install the 'sponsor' program, however, even if slightly unorthodoxly. Since Messenger Plus! 3.60 was released (on September 27, 2005), the setup includes a separate sponsor license agreement in addition to a traditional EULA. Both agreements have also been translated in several languages. A separate adware uninstallation program was provided by Circle Development Ltd. which appears when users attempt to uninstall the sponsor program of Messenger Plus!. =Discontinuation of the Circle Development package= As of early 2010, Messenger Plus! versions 4.84 and later no longer contain the sponsor program from Circle Development Ltd. Yuna Software currently uses more conventional methods. Messenger Plus! bundles an optional toolbar, custom search page and custom home page all branded as the Messenger Plus! Network. Yuna Software also launched sites in 2010 affiliated with Messenger Plus!, including Plus! Games, Plus! Sports, Plus! Image and Plus! Network. Links on the old website to earlier Messenger Plus! versions caused sites such as McAfee SiteAdvisor to warn that the website www.msgpluslive.net was linked with adware Adware-Lop/Swizzor. However, SiteAdvisor has tested the current website www.msgplus.net and found downloads to be free of adware, spyware, and other potentially unwanted programs. Other sites have already found the site safe. For example, Norton Safe Web has found no issues with this site, stating 0 computer threats, 0 identity threats and 0 annoyance factors. =Non-Optional= In February 2013 Yuna Software released a new installer for Messenger Plus that required the user to install at least one of the bundled options in order to install the software. Note that this may no longer be a requirement as more recent updates do not appear to require that any of the bundled options be installed. This has not been confirmed on a clean install. Renaming Messenger Plus!' button integration with Windows Live Messenger. To coincide with the newly branded Windows Live Messenger, in 2006 new versions of Messenger Plus! were called Messenger Plus! Live. It was rebuilt from the ground up and included a new user interface design which was intended to blend more with the user interface of Windows Live Messenger. Since 2011 versions 5.0 and later are called Messenger Plus! again. Messenger Plus! 5 is completely compatible with Windows Live Messenger 2011. =Backwards compatibility= The latest version of Messenger Plus! no longer supports any Messenger version older than 2009. Older Messenger Plus! versions are no longer officially supported. However, the last version of Messenger Plus! (version 3.63, before it was renamed to Messenger Plus! Live) will still be available for download on the official website. This version supports MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger 4.7, 5, 6 and 7.http://www.msgplus.net/Downloads/old Additionally the last version of Messenger Plus! Live (version 4.90.392, before the name was changed back again) is also still available from the official website. This version supports Windows Live Messenger 8.0 up to 14.0 (2009).http://www.msgplus.net/Downloads/v4 Messenger Plus! for Skype Messenger Plus! for Skype Messenger Plus! for Skype was released in English on January 12, 2012. This adware adds video and audio recording capabilities to Skype conversations and lets users send flash animations to other users. The subsequent version, Messenger Plus! for Skype 1.2 was released on March 28, 2012 . which introduced 16 additional languages, video and voice transformation effects and ring tones. Version 1.5 was released on June 18, 2012 . which included the ability to stream movies and overlay images in video conversations viewable on all Skype-enabled devices including mobile phones and tablets. Version 1.8 followed on March 3, 2013 . This release was developed after Microsoft's announcement. about discontinuing its Windows Live Messenger service and integrated custom sounds from the united Messenger Plus! for Windows Live Messenger/Skype sound archive, and also introduced a new default design for the add-on. =Features for Skype= Messenger Plus! for Skype is an application for Skype that adds video and audio recording capabilities for Skype. Notable features include: *Free video and audio call recording of unlimited duration. *3 different levels of video quality *Flash video animation (winks) that can be sent in conversations and previewed. *Chat logs that can be searched and categorized by dates, sessions or by contacts *Preview and print of chat logs *LogViewer that consults with chat logs *Multilanguage support *Mouse over scrollable toolbar *Display recording animated status in the video feed *Video effects: overlay text, mosaic, threshold, mirror, emboss, lens shrink and bulging, invert color effects *Display chat conversation on video conversation *Adjust Video Chat Text font, color, transparency and position *Display date, time and conversation duration a video conversation *Select a user define ringtone per contact for incoming call *Toolbar follow active window *3 levels of noise *Voice transformation effects: chorus, flanger, gain, reverb, tremolo *Built-in Emotion sounds *Custom sounds from united Windows Live Messenger/Skype sound server =Skype Desktop API concerns= Skype has announced its intention to discontinue the desktop API which is used by Messenger Plus! for Skype. Note that the date which this is to happen (originally in December 2013) is now unknown as Skype tries to come up with new methods to support a small subset of the Desktop API functionality. There is currently no information available on the Yuna website that mentions the plans to handle the Desktop API being discontinued by Skype at some point in the future. =Current Development= Version 3.0.0.180 of Messenger Plus for Skype was available for automatic download around January 15, 2014. It was built on January 8th, 2014 and has some updated components from December 2013. In the first version this year there is a \\"feature\\" that seem not to be mentioned anywhere: It sends an ad for Messenger plus as a chat message to random contacts. This feature makes more or less the extension unusable. In the second version this year (3.0.0.185) released in February 2014, this feature is mentioned and can now be turned off. Yuna Software Website =Is Messenger Plus! dead?= Apparently, Messenger Plus is still being supported as noted above despite the fact that Yuna software's website gives the impression that this software is no longer under active development due to the following factors: :1. There has been no noticeable update to their website since ~~August 2013~~ May 2014. The changelog for Messenger Plus! for Skype now mentions the two releases done in 2014. There have been notifications of new updates since then, but they appear to be an error. :2. Their forums are no longer accessible. :3. No mention of the issue with the Desktop API discontinuation has been found on the Messenger Plus! website. :4. The latest version of Skype now crashes when Messenger Plus! for Skype is installed. =Forums= As noted above, the forums are no longer accessible to the public. They may not even exist, as all links to them redirect back to Yuna's website. An archive of the forums does exist, hosted by a third party.  References  External links * Messenger Plus!

The museum's mission is to educate visitors and demonstrate the past 300 years of Iowa's agricultural history. As its name implies, the museum follows the methodology of living history in depicting the lives of people living on farms in the years of 1700, 1850, and 1900, engaging in various agricultural activities. Dr. William G. Murray, an agricultural economist from Iowa State University and two-time gubernatorial candidate, founded the organization, which opened to the public in 1970. Dr. Murray's passion was not to have a museum where people viewed things under glass, but rather a place where history was lived. The museum is divided by Interstate 35/80 and a tractor- drawn cart transports visitors from the town (which is next to the entrance at the Visitor Center) to the west side of the museum. After visiting the 1700 Ioway Farm, 1850 Farm, 1900 Farm, and Wallace Exhibit Center, visitors return to the east side of the interstate. The 1875 town of Walnut Hill features multiple structures, including the Martin and Ellen Flynn Home and barn, both original to the site. The 1700 Ioway Indian Farm features the farming techniques of the Ioway Indians. The farm includes produce originating from the 1700s including blue corn and Omaha melons. Interpreters inform visitors about the Ioway lifestyle including topics such as hunting, roles of men and women, and tool making. Demonstrations include tanning hide, food preparation, and making traditional pottery. The 1850 Pioneer Farm includes a log cabin where visitors are able to see how women cooked with cast iron over a fire, as well as tasks done by hand such as wool spinning and candle making. Outside visitors can see an ox driven plow till the fields filled with crops of corn, wheat, and potatoes. The 1875 Town of Walnut Hill features a general store, schoolhouse, Victorian mansion, bank, and law office among other pioneer town buildings. The town portrays the relationship and dependency between the town's people, the merchants, and the farmers. The 1900 Horse Powered Farm demonstrates the changes that modern machinery and the Industrial Revolution had on farm life. Handwork was replaced by the use of machinery, and work within the farm house changed to include methods such as canning. The particular type of interpretation employed at Living History Farms is third person, so while the people visitors interact with in the museum may be dressed in the manner of the appropriate time period, they do not attempt to \\"act\\" as if they are truly the person they are interpreting (accents, etc.). The presenters often perform the work, and thus will say, \\"I baked this bread,\\" or they address audiences with phrases such as \\"This is how a Print Shop would look in the year 1875.\\" However, since the presenters do not role play, visitors can ask questions about modern issues and receive direct answers. Living History Farms was the site of Pope John Paul II's ecumenical service, Mass, and homily to an audience of around 340,000 on October 4, 1979. During his homily, the Pope spoke about the importance of farming and linked the people who worked the land with the sustenance of the people of the country. He also spoke of the importance of land conservation.

This film is notable for its unusual style, which includes dramatic close-ups, employment of colour gels, and frenetic camera use during the fight sequences. Plot Ding-on is an orphaned blacksmith working in Sharp Foundry, which is run by his master, a friend of his deceased father. The master's daughter, Ling, who narrates the movie, is romantically attracted to both Ding-on and his colleague, Iron Head. One day, Ding-on and Iron Head see a monk fending off a group of thugs, who later ambush and kill him in revenge. Iron Head is so furious that he identifies himself as someone from Sharp Foundry and taunts the thugs to fight him. The master is angry when he hears of Iron Head's reckless behaviour so he punishes him. Iron Head holds a grudge against Ding-on for telling their master about the incident. He becomes even more unhappy when their master announces his decision to make Ding-on his successor. That night, Ding-on overhears a conversation between Ling and her grandmother, and learns that his father died while saving Ling's father from Flying Dragon, a notorious heavily-tattooed assassin. Ding-on desires to seek revenge so he takes his father's weapon, a broken sword (the titular Blade), and bids his master farewell. Ling tries to catch up with him but runs into trouble with the thugs. Ding-on hears Ling's screams for help and returns to save her. He fights with the thugs but loses his right arm and falls off a cliff. Ding-on is saved and nursed back to health by a peasant called Blackie. Seeing that he is now crippled, Ding-on abandons his quest for vengeance, buries his father's sword, and tries to lead a normal life with Blackie. At the same time, Ling and Iron Head venture out in search of Ding-on, whom they believe to be still alive. During this period of time, Ling gradually becomes more disillusioned with life and people, especially after she witnesses Iron Head taking advantage of a prostitute whom he saved earlier. Meanwhile, Ding-on endures humiliation while working in a restaurant. One day, he sees Flying Dragon and feels very frustrated because he can no longer take revenge. One night, a gang of bandits burn down his house, tie him upside-down, and beat him mercilessly. Later, Blackie finds a martial arts manual hidden by her parents and passes it to Ding-on. Ding-on becomes excited and tries to learn the techniques in the book, but cannot afford a good weapon so he uses his father's broken sword. Owing to his handicap and the book's incompleteness, Ding-on's efforts turn out to be futile initially. However, when driven to rage by his frustration, he suddenly makes a breakthrough and develops a devastating spinning movement which allows him to compensate for his lack of an arm and his broken weapon. Ding-on kills the bandits who burnt down his house and saves Ling from danger but does not reveal himself to her. At the same time, an evil man called Skeleton recruits Flying Dragon to help him destroy Sharp Foundry and kill everyone there. A battle breaks out between Flying Dragon and Sharp Foundry's blacksmiths. While his master is struggling to defend himself, Ding-on returns in the nick of time to save his master, and he kills Flying Dragon after a long fight. Skeleton and his men flee after seeing that Flying Dragon is dead. Ding-on then turns his back on Sharp Foundry and leaves with Blackie. In the final scene, an aged Ling imagines herself embracing Ding-on and returning to the happier times in the past.

Particularly in the deep South, the mid-1950s was a period of strident racial segregation for sports, as well as other areas of life. At the time, Grier's participation as a fullback and linebacker against a segregated all-white team on such a prestigious \\"stage\\" was a tremendously significant event. Biography Grier grew up in Massillon, Ohio and after playing college football at Pittsburgh joined the Air Force for a number of years. He retired from military service to be an administrator at a Pittsburgh community college and is still active in the Pittsburgh community. 1956 Sugar Bowl In 1956, Grier was the first to break the Sugar Bowl's color-barrier. Much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl, where Grier's Pitt Panthers would meet the Yellow Jackets from Georgia Tech. There was controversy over whether Grier should be allowed to play, and whether Georgia Tech would participate in the contest. Georgia Governor, Marvin Griffin, was very publicly opposed to racial integration.\\"A Time For Change: Bobby Grier And The 1956 Sugar Bowl\\". blackathlete.net. Retrieved May 9, 2016. A measure for the tenor of this time period is the well known case of Emmett Till being subjected to a lynching in Mississippi, which occurred the previous summer to the 1956 game. Additionally, within thirty days prior, Rosa Parks ignited the Montgomery bus boycott, where she, in protest, refused to relinquish her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama transit bus. A large contingent from the New Orleans community, as well as many related to Georgia Tech, openly fought to bar either Grier, Pitt, or the Yellow Jacket team from the game. Georgia Tech's president, coach, students and football players from the Atlanta-based school, civil rights leaders from multiple locales, as well as a large number of the Pitt community, however, succeeded in seeing Grier take to the gridiron that January day. In anticipation of Grier's presence against Georgia Tech, Georgia governor Marvin Griffin, in December 1955, publicly sent a telegram to his state's Board Of Regents imploring that teams from Georgia not engage in racially integrated events which had blacks either as participants or in the stands. Georgia Tech's president Blake Ragsdale Van Leer rejected this request, which would not serve him well in the 1950s. Griffin would later request that President Van Leer and Georgia Tech's players be punished, Van Leer stuck to his statements and later received a standing ovation from the faculty senate. Georgia Tech won the game 7-0. The margin of victory mostly resulted from a disputed first quarter pass interference penalty which was called on Grier. Photographic evidence later strongly indicated the referee's call was incorrect. The irony of the bad call is that it was made by referee Rusty Coles, from the Pittsburgh area, who had no objective in making the wrong call, but simply made a mistake, which he admitted after seeing the game films. Grier's participation in the 1956 Sugar Bowl, as well as the support he received from various communities, is seen by some experts as a milestone in American race relations.\\"A Time For Change: Bobby Grier And The 1956 Sugar Bowl\\". blackathlete.net.

The route divided a swath of wineries at the foot of the Niagara Escarpment, passing at an oblique angle to the concession road grid. A former Highway 55 designation connected Highway 6 with Highway 53, passing through the Mountain district of Hamilton. The more recent designation was applied in 1970, following the establishment of the Regional Municipality of Niagara. On April 1, 1997, Highway 55 was transferred to Niagara and designated as Niagara Regional Road 55\\\\.  Route description  Highway 55 began at an intersection with the old Iroquois Trail, now known as Queenston Street to the west and York Road to the east. This road was part of Highway 8 until 1970, when it was transferred to Niagara Region and redesignated Niagara Regional Road 81. The roadway that carried Highway 55 continued south of this intersection as Taylor Road (Niagara Regional Road 70). Continuing north, the highway passed beneath the QEW, which ascends over the Welland Canal on the Garden City Skyway. The highway entered Homer, then curved northeast and entered farmland. From here to its northern terminus, the highway was completely straight. It passed south of the St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport and later intersected Niagara Regional Road 106. Highway 55 passed through the small town of Virgil, which is centred on the Four Mile Creek. It intersected Four Mile Creek Road (Niagara Regional Road 100) in the centre of the town, then entered back into an agricultural area. Shortly thereafter, the highway entered the urban area of Niagara-on-the-Lake, where it ended at Mary Street (Niagara Regional Road 87). Several wineries are established along the former route of Highway 55, most notably the Jackson-Triggs Estate.  History  A former Highway 55 designation connected Highway 6 and the QEW with Highway 53, passing through the Mountain district of Hamilton; this route was decommissioned in 1961. The more recent designation was applied in late 1970, following the establishment of Niagara Region. Highway 55 ended near the QEW, pictured in the background rising on to the Garden City Skyway. During the initial settlement period of the Niagara area, following the American Revolutionary War, new wagon routes were built over native footpaths. Grimsby and Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) quickly became established settlements, but travel was cumbersome between them. Pioneers were forced to travel south along the Niagara Road to Queenston, where they turned west and followed the Iroquois Road. To remedy the situation, locals gathered in 1798 and constructed the Black Swamp Road to connect Newark with the Iroquois Road near its crossing of Ten Mile Creek (now the location of the Welland Canal). The route, often subject to flooding from the waterlogged soil which it travelled over, was gradually improved, especially during the 1830s. In the late 1840s the Niagara and Ten Mile Creek Plank Road Company planked the length of the road. During the latter half of the 1800s, the road was macadamized, and gradually came to be known as the Niagara Stone Road as the surrounding swampland was drained and farmed. The original incarnation of Highway 55 travelled through Hamilton. It was established in 1937, following Upper Gage Avenue north from Rymal Road (itself designated Highway 53 that same year) to Crockett Avenue and the Sherman Access. It turned west and followed the access down the Niagara Escarpment, ending at Highway 6 (John Street). The route of this highway changed several times through the late 1950s as the Burlington Skyway was constructed. By 1959, a route down the new Kenilworth Access, north along Kenilworth Avenue and along what is now Burlington Street to the QEW was designated as Highway 55; both routes existed simultaneously between 1957 and 1958. By 1961, this route had been decommissioned. The recent incarnation of Highway 55 was established following the release of the Niagara Peninsula Planning Study in 1964, which recommended that the province take jurisdiction of the Niagara Stone Road (then designated Lincoln County Road 3). It was subsequently assumed on November 5, 1970, the same year the Regional Municipality of Niagara was formed. The route followed the entire length of the Niagara Stone Road from Homer to Niagara-on-the-Lake and remained unchanged over its 27 years of existence. Highway 55 was transferred to the Regional Municipality of Niagara on April 1, 1997, as part of the first round of mass downloading. It is now designated as Niagara Regional Road 55\\\\. The majority of the former route is named the Niagara Stone Road; within Niagara-on-the-Lake it is named Mississauga Street.  Major intersections  Highway 55 is now known as Niagara Regional Road 55\\\\.

The dedication reads: To my dear friend Mr. Max Ibach, with kindest regards and best wishes from Frederic Lamond. 8. 11. 1898, Bruxelles Frederic Archibald Lamond (28 January 186821 February 1948) was a Scottish classical pianist and composer, and the second-last surviving pupil of Franz Liszt. Early life Lamond was born in Glasgow, Scotland. After exhausting the resources of his home town, he continued his musical study abroad in Germany under Max Schwarz and Hans von B√ºlow. He studied with Franz Liszt at Weimar and Rome in 1885, and in London in 1886. In 1886 Lamond also met Johannes Brahms, who coached him in his own works. Lamond also became acquainted with Anton Rubinstein in Germany, hearing him conduct and play many times there, and later in Russia in the 1890s. Career In addition to becoming one of the early champions of Brahms' piano works, Lamond was considered the primary authority on Beethoven's piano music before Artur Schnabel, and Breitkopf & H√§rtel published his edition of the piano sonatas. In 1893 Lamond was invited by Vasily Safonov to Moscow to play Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto in B-flat minor, Op. 23, at the request of the composer. While in Russia, he met Alexander Scriabin, whose Second Sonata, Op. 19, Lamond later played. In the 1920s and '30s, Lamond recorded many works of Beethoven (including an acoustic recording of the \\"Emperor\\" Concerto complete under Eug√®ne Goossens, for HMV) and Liszt, as well as a scattered assortment of smaller works by other composers. While not the greatest of technicians by the time of his recordings ‚Äî reviews from his youth praise his accuracy and bravura in such taxing works as the Brahms Paganini Variations, Op. 35 ‚Äî his graceful phrasing and singing tone are quite remarkable. Later life Lamond married in 1904 the Austrian actress Irene Triesch (1877‚Äì1964). Despite his declining technique, he continued to give concerts until the end of his life, and was in Prague in 1938 when the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia. Forced to leave most of his belongings behind, including an unfinished novel, he left for England. A friend later recounted Lamond's flight when he was stopped at the border at Eger. \\"A Gestapo officer insisted on seeing his passport. 'You can see it, he said, 'but I will not allow you to take it into your hands.' The officer then asked him, 'Are you an Aryan?' to which Lamond replied, 'No, I am a monkey!' Lamond was a courageously outspoken man who would stand no nonsense.\\"Frederick Kohn, 'Frederic Lamond: A Memoir', The Journal of the British Institute of Recorded Sound, No. 65, Jan. 1977, p.642. Lamond was a highly respected teacher, among whose pupils were Gunnar Johansen, Jan Chiapusso, Ervin Nyiregyh√°zi, and Victor Borge. Lamond died at the age of eighty, in Stirling.

He was the head of the Presidential Security Service (PSB) from 1991 to 1996, State Duma deputy from 2007 to 2011, and retired Lieutenant- general. Korzhakov had been Yeltsin's bodyguard since 1985, and on 19 August 1991, he stood next to his boss on top of a tank during Yeltsin's historic speech. Being the Chief of the Security Service, Korzhakov was widely criticized for interfering in government affairs and business. In 1996, he was finally sacked after losing a power struggle with the Prime Minister. He then successfully ran for a seat in the State Duma where he received immunity from prosecution. In 1997, Korzhakov published a biography based on his experience at the very top of Russian politics. In the biography he contends that he and the Security Service \\"governed the country for three years\\".  Early life  Alexander Korzhakov was born in Moscow to a worker family. After graduating at secondary school, he worked as an assembly worker. In 1969‚Äì1970 he served as a private in the Kremlin Regiment. In 1970‚Äì1989 he served in the KGB 9th Chief Directorate, \\"Protection of Higher Party and Government Officials\\". As a KGB official, he became a member of the Communist Party in 1971, being a member of the Party bureau of subdivisions and member of the committee of the Komsomol for the 9th administration. In 1978 he was transferred into a KGB subdivision, which dealt with personal protection. In 1980 he graduated \\"by Correspondence\\" from a Moscow Law Institute ( Moskovskiy Yuridichesky Institut, Zaochny fakultet). Following service in Afghanistan in 1981‚Äì1982, he was one of president Yuri Andropov's personal bodyguards in 1983‚Äì1984. In 1985 he became one of three personal bodyguards of Boris Yeltsin, who at the time was the leader of the Communist Party organization in Moscow. When, in 1987, Yeltsin was removed from his party position, Korzhakov kept the friendship and in 1989 was retired from KGB for his support of Yeltsin ‚Äì officially, Korzhakov was discharged from the KGB due to \\"health and age reasons\\". After his retirement he became a private body guard of Yeltsin, albeit officially worked as the Chief of Security of a co-operative named \\"Plastic\\". In 1989 gave a notice about the resignation from the Communist Party and was expelled for \\"non- payment of the party dues\\".\\"–ö–û–†–ñ–ê–ö–û–í –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á\\" at niiss.ru After the incident on 28 September 1989, when Boris Yeltsin fell from a bridge, Korzhakov set up a unit of former KGB agents to protect Yeltsin. Following the election of Yeltsin in June 1991 as President of the RSFSR, Korzhakov became the Chief of Yeltsin's Security Service, which was later transformed into the Presidential Security Service when the Soviet Union was dissolved. He was responsible for the protection of Yeltsin during the August coup attempt in 1991 and on 4 October 1993, when the White House of Russia was stormed. = Head of the Security Service = Korzhakov with Yeltsin in 1991 Being the head of the Presidential Security Service, Korzhakov was frequently accused of interfering in governmental affairs, as the Service gathered evidence on high government officials engaged in corruption, bribe-taking, and squandering money. He was regarded as one of the hard-liners of Yeltsin's team, a strong backer of the war in Chechnya, and an opponent to holding the presidential election in 1996. In December 1994, Korzhakov organized an armed raid on the Moscow headquarters of Most Bank headed by Vladimir Gusinsky, an ally with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, who was a potential rival to Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential elections. Soon after the raid, Luzhkov denied he had any desire to run for president ‚Äì and Gusinsky quickly moved with his family to London. Running up to the 1996 Presidential election, there were serious doubts that President Boris Yeltsin would allow elections to take place. On 5 May 1996, Korzhakov explicitly called for postponing the elections. However, the elections took place as planned and Yeltsin finished first in 16 June 1996, initial round of the Presidential elections with about 35% of the vote, scheduled to compete with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in the runoff on 3 July 1996. During Korzhakov's reign, it is believed that the Presidential Security Service acquired documents which implicated first deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais in illegal financial transactions during the privatization period that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. On 19 June 1996 Sergey Lisovsky (a wealthy advertising and showbusiness magnate) and Arkady Yevstafyev (a close aide to former first deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais) were arrested while leaving the White House of Russia, allegedly carrying a case containing 500 thousand dollars. After being questioned for 11 hours by Presidential Security Service, Lisovsky and Yevstafyev were released. Tipped off by Chubais, television networks started to broadcast updates on the unfolding scandal through the night, portraying the arrests as a coup attempt by Korzhakov. The next day, 20 June 1996, Korzhakov was abruptly dismissed by Yeltsin at the urging of Chubais. According to one view, the firings of Korzhakov were the result of a battle between factions within the President's inner circle ‚Äì between a group that wanted to take power by force and a group that wanted to win the election \\"legitimately.\\" Others saw the events in the context of an ongoing struggle between three groups: the former heads of the power ministries, representatives of the energy complex, and representatives from financial circles.  Biography  In his biography, Boris Yeltsin: From Dawn to Dusk (1997), Korzhakov describes how the Russian Political elite views democracy ‚Äì an overwhelmingly negative evaluation of Russian politics. Naturally, the book has been severely criticized, however, only few people have accused the author of inventing or distorting the major facts. = The 1993 storming of the Parliament = An important contribution of the biography is its description of the anti-democratic mentality inside the Kremlin. Korzhakov explains the severely negative outlook of Yeltsin, and the ruling elite as a whole, towards the democratic institutions. Korzhakov recounts certain developments in March 1993, when the Russian parliament was only inches away from impeaching the president. Aware of this danger, Yeltsin ordered Korzhakov to prepare the arrest of all deputies in the case of impeachment. Referring to documents never published before, Korzhakov asserts that Yeltsin had even planned to use chemical gases in order to \\"smoke\\" the deputies from the building. The Parliament was eventually stormed by the Russian army on 4 October 1993 and the rebellion suppressed by force. = The 1996 Presidential Election = In regards to the presidential election in 1996, as well as in 1993, Yeltsin had ‚Äì according to Korzhakov ‚Äì no intention of leaving the Kremlin and was prepared to take any actions to insure his continued stay. Yeltsin felt free to express his contempt toward democratic principles in Korzhakov's presence. Some episodes the author relates are almost resonant of the Nixon years and the published Watergate tapes. According to Korzhakov, in the summer of 1996, Yeltsin and his prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin debated the very serious possibility of canceling the presidential election. Korzhakov adds several significant details which possibly confirm the view that the Kremlin violated many democratic rules during the presidential election campaign in 1996. He also fully explains, with much elaboration, the story about how Anatoly Chubais' people tried to illegally take 500 thousand dollars from the Kremlin. = The Yeltsin family = Democratic institutions such as the Parliament and the courts played an extremely limited role in the life of the Kremlin and had no influence over the decision making process. Instead, Yeltsin's family emerges, according to Korzhakov, as a leading political institution in Russia. Korzhakov concludes, \\"when it came to making decisions, Yeltsin was motivated not by the interest of the state, but by his own family clan\\". Alexander Litvinenko ‚Äì a former KGB/FSB Officer who changed sides in early-mid 2000s in his book \\"Blowing Up Russia\\" blames Korzhakov (along with Barsukov): only \\"their greed for money\\" was the reason of the first and partly the second chechen war. = The people around Yeltsin = Korzhakov contends that the Kremlin was run by various unconventional leaders such as body guards like Korzhakov, himself. In the book, Korzhakov confessed that he and the FSB chief Mikhail Barsukov, another member of Yeltsin's guard, \\"governed the country for three years\\". Korzhakov paints an interesting portrait of the people around Yeltsin, few of whom are depicted as being more elevated in moral virtue and intellect than the author. Korzhakov describes the atmosphere surrounding Yeltsin as thick with unbridled favoritism, a fertile ground for intrigues among those struggling for the president's ear. Even the idea of murder hangs over the Kremlin in the late 1990s. The requests and promises of people in the Kremlin to murder their political rivals are interspersed throughout the book. In 1999, Korzhakov repeated allegations that financial mogul Boris Berezovsky tried to convince him to murder Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, financial tycoon and NTV founder Vladimir Gusinsky, as well as popular crooner and Duma deputy Iosif Kobzon, a Luzhkov ally.Korzhakov Says Bombings Were Berezovsky's Doing, by Natalya Shulyakovskaya, themoscowtimes.com, 28 October 1999. Retrieved on 2 January 2016. Korzhakov also contends that during his State Duma election campaign in the aftermath of his ousting from the Kremlin in June 1996, his political adversaries wanted to kill his main rival in the parliamentary election in Tula in order to render the election invalid.  Legacy  Korzhakov presenting his book Besy 2.0 in 2017 Following the replacement of Korzhakov, the Presidential Security Service was reorganized under Anatoly Kuznetsov, a professional without any political ambitions or interests, effectively depriving the Service its unique political influence. In January 1997, Korzhakov won, as an independent candidate, a by-election over 10 other candidates with 26.86 percent of the vote in Tula, south of Moscow, filling a vacancy left by Alexander Lebed. In the State Duma he quickly became a member of the defence committee. The same year, he worked as a consultant of the artistic motion picture Shizofreniya Shizofreniya (2001).

It is sparsely travelled, but paved throughout its length.  Route description  Highway 650 through the community of Dane Highway 650 begins in the west at Highway 112, travelling southeast through the community of Dane. It passes several residences and turns east. The highway exits the community and crosses the Ontario Northland Railway (ONR), east of which the road is sparsely travelled. It zig-zags southeast through dense forest. After crossing a swamp, the highway curves to the northeast and passes beneath two high-tension transmission lines. It then curves to the south, crossing a spur of the ONR built to serve the mine, after which the road is privately maintained. The entire length of the route is paved.  History  Highway 650 was designated on April 1, 1964, following an access road to the newly opened mine east from Dane. The route was gravel-surfaced at the time; it was paved in its entirety by mid-1967. The route has remained unchanged since then. Despite the closure of the mine in 1990, the road remained a provincial route through the 1997 and 1998 highway transfers; its annual average daily traffic is 30 vehicles, the second lowest of any provincially maintained highway.

Her mother, a singer, named her after the heroine of Bellini's opera, Norma. Born Norma Allison Cook,U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007 for Norma Cook Wagner she was acclaimed for her adroit impersonations of popular public figures, which she had performed in Florenz Ziegfeld's Follies, but may be best known for having originated the roles of Magnolia Hawks and her daughter Kim (as an adult) in the original Broadway production of Show Boat in 1927. She reprised her role in the first New York revival of the show in 1932. However, she was not selected to reprise her role in the 1929 part-talkie film, nor in the 1936 film version. Irene Dunne, who was discovered for Hollywood in the first touring company of Show Boat, would make her film debut in 1929, and go on to become one of the greatest stars of Hollywood's Golden Age. It was Dunne who eventually eclipsed Terris as Magnolia, playing the role in the 1936 film. Rather than have Dunne also play the role of Kim in the movie, the producers chose musical comedy star Sunnie O'Dea for the role. Terris was originally chosen to play the dual roles of Moonyean Clare and her niece Kathleen in Through the Years, Vincent Youmans's 1932 musical version of Jane Cowl's once-popular play, Smilin' Through, but she was replaced at the last minute. The musical was a failure, but in 2001, it was given a highly acclaimed studio cast recording. She made two films during the early days of talking pictures - Married In Hollywood, and the 1930 version of Cameo Kirby, which was, like Show Boat, a riverboat musical involving a gambler. Cameo Kirby appears to be lost, and only twelve minutes of Married in Hollywood apparently survive. Marriage Terris married a doctor and retired to Connecticut, where she was an avid supporter of the Goodspeed Opera House and what eventually became the Norma Terris Theatre. She was later married to Albert D. Firestone, son of the late William McKinley and Gladys Bigam Firestone of Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The couple spent winters at their Palm Beach, Florida residence, where they acted as major donors to the Ballet Florida, and summered at their Lyme, Connecticut. Mr. Firestone, who was very dedicated to her remembrance, died in 1997 at their summer residence in Lyme. Last years In 1961 she appeared at a performance of the American Light Opera Company production of Show Boat in Washington, D.C. at the invitation of its director, Donn B. Murphy. On the stage at the Trinity Theatre, she reminisced about the original production. Climbing atop a piano at a cast party after the show, she did a devastating impersonation of an inebriated Helen Morgan (who had created the role of Julie) singing \\"Bill\\" from the show. Legacy In 1984, Goodspeed Musicals created a second performance venue in Chester, Connecticut which is named the Norma Terris Theatre. Death Terris was, until her death in 1989, two days after her 85th birthday, the last surviving adult actor to have appeared in the original production of Show Boat.

The park was once the largest in the United States. Location Olentangy Park was located in what is now the southwest corner of Clintonville. The park boundaries on its west and east sides were the Olentangy River and north High Street, North Street on the south, and nearly to West Tulane Road on the north. History Olentangy Park postcard =Robert M. Turner (1880‚Äì1899)= Prior to 1880, Olentangy Park was a wooded area on the Olentangy River which was popular for picnics and swimming. There was a mill in the area north of Ackerman Road. In 1880, Robert M. Turner purchased the area. The first development of this property was the building of a formal picnic ground and swimming area in 1881. Then a tavern was built on the site and Turner renamed it \\"The Villa.\\" Between 1881 and 1895, little changed. A few small amusement rides, a carousel, and possibly some pony rides were added. =Columbus Railway, Power and Light Company= In 1895, the Columbus Railway, Power and Light Company purchased \\"The Villa.\\" \\"The Villa\\" lay at the northern end of the company's North High Street trolley line. The trolley house was located nearby on the corner of North High Street and Ackerman Road. The company hoped to use \\"The Villa\\" to attract riders to its North High Street trolley route. Electric lighting was added to the park in 1896. The tavern continued to operate. Olentangy Park Theatre =The Dusenbury brothers (1899‚Äì1909)= In 1899, 100 acres of \\"The Villa\\" were purchased by the Dusenbury brothers of New Lexington, Ohio. They renamed the area Olentangy Park and developed the amusement park concern. The first addition was a roller coaster called \\"The Figure Eight.\\" The 1904 World's Fair was held in St. Louis. At its conclusion, the Dusenbury brothers purchased the \\"Japanese Gardens\\" exhibit and installed it at Olentangy Park. The gardens became a beautiful, tranquil retreat from the Park's rides and noise. Near the river, a large theatre was constructed. At the time, it was the largest theatre in the United States. The largest dancing pavilion in the country was built in 1907. A formal picnic area was cleared in the ravine which separated the north and south ends of the park. Wooden walking bridges were built over the ravines connecting the Park's various points. By 1910, the brothers had added considerably to Olentangy Park. A zoo with monkeys, bears, and elephants was built near the Park's southern end. A boat house, known as the \\"Canoe Club,\\" was constructed along the banks of the Olentangy River. Visitors could rent a canoe for a quiet afternoon of boating on the Olentangy. An arcade was constructed along the northern end of the Park which featured rows of enclosed rides such as \\"The Olde Mill,\\" and the \\"Tunnel of Love.\\" A restaurant replaced the tavern. Electric lighting was added throughout the Park. The North High Street Trolley was diverted into the Park. Trolleys could exit North High Street at North Street, travel through a large \\"castle gate\\" and arrive at the Park's exclusive trolley stop. Olentangy Park became one of a growing number of \\"Trolley parks\\" becoming more common at the time in the United States. Visitors could reach such a park from every corner of their city. =The Dusenbury brothers (1910‚Äì1923)= 1910s From 1910, Olentangy Park grew rapidly. Some of the park's most famous rides were installed in this period. One such ride was the \\"Loop the Loop\\" which was one of America's first looping roller coasters. It was removed because it placed too much physical stress on its riders. Others included the \\"Whirlwind\\" and the \\"Red Devil.\\" The \\"Red Devil\\" was built feet from North High Street. Riders soared dozens of feet above the west side of the road. A Ferris wheel, swing ride and pony rides also arrived. \\"Shoot-the-Chutes\\" was a tall water slide added in the center of the park's arcade. Riders boarded a wide, flat bottomed boat that traveled up a side chute then shot down the slide. It made a large wave that showered riders and spectators. An elephant was trained to ride down the slide. In 1914, a Mangels-Illions carousel was purchased for the Park. It had 52 horses and 2 chariots, hand carved by the Lithuanian master carousel carver Marcus C. Illions and Sons. This \\"Grand Carousel\\" was one of only a few manufactured by the William F. Mangels Company. According to the Franklin County Recorder, Joseph Dusenbury and his wife, Ada, gave some land to the Olentangy Park Company in 1915. Joseph gave even more land in 1917, allowing for the park's expansion. 1920s A significant addition to Olentangy Park in the 1920s was the world's largest swimming pool which was constructed near the theatre. The pool was several hundred feet long. It was able to accommodate hundreds of bathers. In an effort to simulate an \\"ocean side setting\\", such as that found in New Jersey, hundreds of tons of sand were trucked in and dumped around the pool's edges to create a beach. The pool remained the largest in the world for many years. It was the third largest constructed in the United States. Development of the park placed financial strain on the Dusenbury brothers. This was complicated by poor custom in the 1923 season. The Dusenbury brothers sold Olentangy Park to \\"The Olentangy Amusement Company,\\" a group of investors. It was placed under the management of Max Stern. The investors continued to operate the Park successfully through the remainder of the 1920s. However, there was little further development by them. =Leo and Elmer Heanlein (1929‚Äì1937)= In 1929, the Heanlein brothers signed a lease on the park and took control. They expanded the zoo and added a fun house to the arcade. Profits for many amusement parks decreased during the depression. The bookings avoided the closure of Olentangy Park. =L.L. LeVeque Company (1937‚Äì1939)= In 1937, the L.L. LeVeque Company purchased Olentangy Park. The company's intention was to sell the park's rides and equipment. The Gooding Amusement Company, which also owned the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, purchased the carousel, the Ferris wheel, the airplane ride, the dodgem cars and the rifle range. Many of the rides were relocated to the Wyandot Lake Amusement Park. Olentangy Park closed in September 1938. In the first part of 1939, much of the area was levelled so that the L.L. LeVeque company could build the Olentangy Village apartment complex. The complex was designed by Raymond Snow, a Washington, D.C. architect. Olentangy Park Remnants In 1940, a bowling alley, the Olentangy Lanes, was constructed on the site of the Park's parking lot. It was destroyed by fire on Oct. 27, 1980.‚ÄúFire Destroys Olentangy Village Bowling Lanes‚Äù The Columbus Dispatch. Home Final Edition: 27 Oct 1980. News Section. Pg. 1. The park's \\"castle gate\\" and theatre remained until 1940. Both were destroyed by fires. The only remaining building is the park's office and zoo keeper's quarters. The stone building is located at the curve of North Street. It has been divided into six apartments. Some of the Park's original wrought iron fencing can still be seen along the northern side of North Street from High Street to the curve at the stone office house. This fencing, with its distinctive \\"O\\" pattern, was duplicated in the 1950s along North High Street. The same portion of North Street was the Park's original walk up entrance. The foundation of the Park's \\"Canoe Club\\" and the steps that once led up to the Park's theatre are partly hidden in the banks of the Olentangy River, north of Ackerman Road. The concrete foundations of the wooden walking bridges crossing the picnic ravines are visible on either side of the ravine's streams. The former picnic ravine itself is located behind a tanning salon on North High Street.

In 1999 it was removed from Wyandot Lake and Carousel Works Inc. was commissioned to undertake a costly restoration. The carousel resumed operation in spring 2000, housed in a climate controlled building at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. There, in the first month of operation, 42,000 customers paid $1 each to ride it. On July 28, 2004, the carousel celebrated its one millionth rider since being restored and moved to the zoo. \\"The Columbus Zoo Carousel Spins its One Millionth Rider\\" =The 1920s swimming pool= The Olentangy Park swimming pool survived for decades as a functioning part of the Olentangy Village apartment complex. In 1996, the pool was reduced to half its former size to make room for new apartment buildings, and finally, in 2002, the remainder of the pool was filled in to create new village space.

The Russian Navy is divided into four fleets and one flotilla: Northern Fleet, Pacific Fleet, Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and Caspian Flotilla. The air forces of the largest and most important fleets, the Northern and Pacific fleets, operate long range Tu-142 anti- submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, Il-38 medium-range ASW aircraft, and Ka-27 shipborne ASW and search-and-rescue (SAR) helicopters. Formations operating supersonic Tu-22M3 bombers were transferred to the Russian Air Force's Long Range Aviation in 2011.air force monthly, January 2012 The relatively small fleets, the Baltic and Black Sea, currently have only tactical Su-24 bombers and ASW helicopters in service. The small Caspian Flotilla operates An-26 and Mi-8 transports, Ka-27PS rescue helicopters, as well as some Ka-29 and Mi-24 armed helicopters.

A Sukhoi Su-33 from the 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment, on Admiral Kuznetsov's flight deck Kamov Ka-29 assault transport helicopter, from 830th Independent Shipborne Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment History The Russian naval aviation participated in the Russian military intervention in the War in Syria for a few months from November 2016 to January 2017 with the deployment of Russian Admiral Kuznetsov carrier to the Mediterranean. This deployment to Syria also marked the naval aviation's combat debut. On 15 November 2016, Admiral Kuznetsov, took part in \\"a large-scale operation against the positions of terrorist groups Islamic State and Al-Nusra, in the provinces of Idlib and Homs\\" in Syria by launching Su-33 fighter strikes. This was the first time a Russian aircraft carrier would take part in combat operations. Russian Defence Ministry later reported that at least 30 militants had been killed as a result of those strikes, including 3 field commanders, among them Abul Baha al-Asfari, leader of Al- Nusra reserves in the provinces of Homs and Aleppo. Al-Asfari had also planned and led several insurgent attacks on the city of Aleppo itself. The Su-33s reportedly used precision bombs.3 Nusra commanders, dozens of jihadists killed in airstrikes from Russian aircraft carrier ‚Äì MoD RT, 17 November 2016 On 3 December 2016, an Su-33 crashed into the sea after attempting to land on the carrier. The plane crashed on its second attempt to land on the aircraft carrier in good weather conditions. The pilot was safely recovered by a search and rescue helicopter. Initially it was suspected that the plane missed the wires and failed to go around, falling short of the bow of the warship, but later it was revealed that the arresting cable failed to hold the aircraft, and was damaged in the attempt. Following the two incidents, the air wing was transferred to shore at Khmeimim Air Base near Latakia, Syria to continue military operations while the carrier's arresting gear issues were addressed. In early January 2017, it was announced that Admiral Kuznetsov and her battlegroup would be ceasing operations in Syria and returning to Russia as part of a scaling back of Russian involvement in the conflict. During her deployment off Syria, aircraft from Admiral Kuznetsov carried out 420 combat missions, hitting 1,252 hostile targets. On 11 January 2017, Admiral Kuznetsov was conducting live-fire training exercises in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya.

In January 1992 its personnel refused to take the oath of loyalty to Ukraine, which would have presumably made them part of the Ukrainian Navy or Ukrainian Air Force, and instead its personnel left for Russia, leaving their aircraft and equipment behind. The unit regrouped at Severomorsk-3 as part of the Northern Fleet. However, in February 1993 the regiment was disbanded and its personnel and equipment incorporated into the 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment. The 279th Independent Shipborne Assault Aviation Regiment was established in 1973.Holm In 1990 it became a Maritime Assault Aviation Regiment. On 22 February 1993 it was renamed the 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment as it absorbed the remaining elements of the 100th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment. =Structure in 2007= This is the structure of the Russian Naval Aviation, as reproduced from the August 2007 issue of the Air Forces Monthly.Air Force Monthly 2007 Given the new data from 2015-16 about the two shipborne fighter aviation regiments above, the 100th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment, listed at Severomorsk-3 with the MiG-29K, has been removed from the Northern Fleet listing.

Each new naval air base consists of an HQ, support units and one or more aviation groups/wings (the former air bases). In a second stage, the air bases were merged into territorially integrated structures. Only the 279th Regiment retained its status. The planned transfer of Naval Aviation assets (Su-24, Su-27, Tu-22M3, MiG-31) to the Air Force has been delayedMoscow Defense Brief #2, 2011 p. 18-22 due to their importance to the service, but was finally implemented by the end of 2011. As of 2012, the only fixed wing strike and fighter aircraft of Russian Naval Aviation are the Su-33 fighters and Su-25UTG attack aircraft of the 279th Regiment (forming the Admiral Kuznetsov's carrier air wing), plus the Su-24 bombers based in the Crimea. This sole bomber unit remained part of Naval Aviation as an exception to satisfy treaty requirements governing Russian forces deployments on Ukrainian territory (these must be part of the Black Sea Fleet). Buying brand new multirole Sukhoi Su-30SM for the Black Sea Fleet to replace Su-24 was in the planning stages and it has been completed as of December 2016. Naval aviation also retains the anti- submarine aircraft of the forces (the Tu-142 and the Il-38) and the helicopter arm. Given the new data from 2015-16 from Russian sources regarding the 100th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment's disbandment in 1993, Air Force's Monthly's listing of both the 100th and 279th Regiments at the Severomorsk-3 NAB has been altered by removal of the 100 KIAP. Naval air bases of the Russian Naval Aviation include: Baltic Fleet air bases - HQ at Kaliningrad: * Doiskoe NAB * Chernyakhovsk NAB * Chkalovsk NAB * Khabrovo NAB Black Sea Fleet air bases - HQ at Sevastopol: * Gvardiyskoye NAB * Kacha NAB * Novofedorivka NAB * Saki ** 43rd Independent Naval Attack Aviation Regiment (43rd OMShAP) (formerly at Gvardeiskoye) (Su-30SM, Su-24M/MR) Northern Fleet air bases - HQ at Severomorsk: * Kipelovo NAB * Olenegorsk NAB * Severomorsk-1 NAB * Severomorsk-2 NAB * Severomorsk-3 NAB ** 279th Independent Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment (279th OKIAP) * Monchegorsk NAB ** 98th Composite Aviation Regiment (98th SAP) Pacific Fleet air bases - HQ at Vladivostok: * Chkalovsk NAB ** 72nd Guards Air Base * Elizovo NAB/Yelizovo (Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Airport) ** 7060th Air Base * Kamennyy Ruchey NAB * Nikolaev NAB = Actual structure = The Soviet and its successor the Russian Naval Aviation follow the TOE of the Soviet (Russian Air Force respectively). This practice has been formally established with Order No. 0036 of the Navy Chief-of-Staff (issued on October 7 and implemented on December 15, 1947). Therefore, it followed air force unit convention (air army (air corps) - aviation division - aviation regiment) and its personnel held air force type ranks (generals, colonels, majors etc.). A major divergence from the practice in the NATO member states and the countries, which follow US air force traditions is that the Soviet Union, its Warsaw Pact and other Socialist allies (such as Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba etc.) kept flying units and the ground support units separate (radar, signals, engineer units) subordinated separately to higher command and control level. For example, an aviation regiment and the radar and signals battalion, the air field battalion and the other support units servicing the air field reported to their air division. Another difference is that Soviet military air arms did not bring aviation units of different branches (fighter, transport, helicopter) together. The only exceptions were Mixed Aviation Regiments (which performed liaison and transport tasks for armies, military districts etc. and had a fleet of An-24/ An-26 planes and Mi-8/ Mi-9 helicopters) or rarely air regiments, which flew one single type in different variants and tasks (for example a Tu-22 naval missile-carrying aviation regiment flying 1-2 missile-carrying aviation squadrons and a squadron of reconnaissance or EW variants). The 2008 Russian military reform planned during the term of Anatoly Serdyukov changed that. The main organizational change in the Ground Forces was the transition from a 4-level operational chain of command (Military District ‚Äî Army ‚Äî Division ‚Äî Regiment) to a 3-level one (Military District ‚Äî Operational Command (Army) ‚Äî Brigade). The Air Force transitioned correspondingly to Military District ‚Äî Operational Command ‚Äî Air Base chain of command. The air bases combined geographically closely located flying units of various arms with ground support units. As the naval aviation followed the air force organizational practice it too adopted the air base organization. The separate air commands of the fleets (Air Force of the Northern Fleet, Air Force of the Pacific Fleet, Air Force of the Baltic Fleet and Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet) were disbanded and naval aviation assets adopted a three level operational chain of command including Military District ‚Äî Fleet ‚Äî Air Base. Concerning its inventory, it was decided that the naval aviation divest its heavy bombers and fighter aircraft (except for the Admiral Kuznetsov air wing), transferring them to the Air Force. The re-organization of the Air Force was later reverted on the grounds of being counter- productive. The four Air Forces and Air Defence Operational Commands (1st through 4th) were reverted to Air Forces and Air Defence Armies (6th, 14th, 11th and 4th respectively), one per military district each. With the establishment of the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command as a de facto fifth military district a new 45th Air Forces and Air Defence Army was formed under it. Its aviation units belong to the naval aviation unlike the other four air armies, which consist of air force units. The air force also started transforming its fighter aviation from air bases into fighter aviation regiments belonging to composite aviation divisions. The naval aviation also reverted the decision to divest its fighter air arm (but not its bomber aircraft, which remain with the Air Force). MiG-31 were transferred back to the Navy and new Su-30SM heavy multirole fighters were ordered. These aircraft were grouped into fighter aviation regiments independent from the air bases. As of 2019 the naval aviation air bases consist of maritime patrol and ASW aircraft, transport aircraft, ASW helicopters, combat and assault helicopters, transport helicopters and UAVs. Naval aviation is following the air force in the resurrection of the air divisions as an operational level of command and control. It is yet undecided whether the naval aviation air bases will become air divisions, reforming their fixed wing, helicopter and UAV assets in aviation regiments and squadrons or new composite naval aviation divisions will be formed and the NAABs will be subordinated to them next to the fighter aviation regiments. = Naval aviation in 2019 =  Naval High Command  Naval High Command (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–ú–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –§–ª–æ—Ç–∞) ‚Äî Saint Petersburg * units directly subordinated to the NHC (—á–∞—Å—Ç—ã —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥—á–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è)http://milkavkaz.com/index.php/voorujonnie-cili-racii/vmf/chasti- tcentralnogo-podchinenia- vmf ** Naval Aviation Central Signals Node (–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —É–∑–µ–ª —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –∞–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –í–ú–§) (Domodedovo (Moscow)) ** Naval Aviation Training Center (–£—á–µ–±–Ω—ã–π —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –∞–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –í–ú–§) (Severomorsk-1) - basic theoretic training for naval aviators ** 859th Center for Naval Aviation Combat Application [Training] and Re-qualification of Flying Personnel (859-–π –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –±–æ–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—É—á–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ª–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –∞–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏) (Yeysk Airfield) - Su-33, Su-30SM, MiG-29K/KUB, Su-25UTG, L-39ZA, Il-38N, Il-20, An-140-100, An-26, Ka-27PL, Ka-28, Ka-29 ** SAR Navy Support Aviation Squadron (–ê–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —ç—Å–∫–∞–¥—Ä–∏–ª—å—è –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–æ–≤–æ-—Å–ø–∞—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –í–ú–§ –†–§) (Ostafyevo (Shcherbinka) Airfield): An-12PS, An-26, An-72, An-140-100.

The channel had very often been criticized for its sensationalist attempts and its obsession with subjects as well as its subversive nature. On 22 January 2013 it ceased broadcasting on cable as its licence was retracted by the National Audiovisual Council of Romania for not having paid a large sum of money consisting of fines received for having repeatedly violated Romanian audiovisual legislation.  History of the station = First years and first closure = OTV was launched in 2000 as Oglinda TVFile din \\"senza»õionala‚Äù istorie a otevizƒÉrii Rom√¢niei - Yahoo! News (oglinda being the Romanian word for mirror) by Dan Diaconescu, following the imminent closure of the Romanian TV station Tele 7 ABC, where Diaconescu moderated a talk show. The station's main show has been from its start Dan Diaconescu Direct (Dan Diaconescu Live), a tabloid talk show lasting several hours, from early evening until late night, and featuring obscure guests such as spiritual mediums, manele singers and local petty criminals. In 2002, due to violation of laws regarding television broadcast, the station's broadcast licence was retracted by the National Audiovisual Council. This interruption in OTV's broadcast lasted for two years and was seen by a part of the general public as an act of censorship of the ruling government. Diaconescu claimed that the ban on his station's broadcast was because he refused to sell a 51% stake of OTV to Adrian NƒÉstase, who was prime minister at that time. = \\"Investigation serials\\" = In 2004, after the ban was lifted, OTV restarted its broadcast. It featured three news crawls at the bottom of the screen and various on-screen text captions showing words such as Incredible, Sensational, Extraordinary. The subjects debated on Diaconescu's talk show maintained their tabloid style and included scenarios of a looming doomsday, investigation into \\"mystery deaths\\", revelations of religious figures and scandals among Romanian celebrities. Starting September 2007, OTV became notorious for its investigation into the \\"mysterious\\" disappearance of Romanian lawyer Elodia Ghinescu, a subject which was debated for 239 consecutive evenings, termed by the channel episodes, and attracted a significant number of viewers. After the Elodia serial other such subjects received similar coverage. The 2009 Media Sustainability Index noted that: \\"OTV has a long history of offering Romanians extreme forms of infotainment. Its formal owner organizes long talk shows with bizarre characters, and the main topic is various crimes and disappearances. From 2007 to 2008, OTV organized several hundred so-called episodes about the disappearance of Elodia Ghinescu, a lawyer who married a police officer. In one episode, Diaconescu instigated a hacker to break into Ghinescu‚Äôs e-mail inbox and show her personal messages on the air. Ghinescu became a popular icon, although she continues to be missing. Meanwhile, the mainstream media took over the case and followed OTV‚Äôs example in revealing personal details about her family.\\"MEDIA SUSTAINABILITY INDEX 2009, p. 89 Other Romanian TV stations soon launched similar late-night talk shows, in a process called by Diaconescu the \\"otevisation\\" of Romania.Cristi IRIMIA: ‚ÄúOtevizarea ≈üi manelizarea Rom√¢niei continuƒÉ‚Äù = Politics = Traian BƒÉsescu, President of Romania in 2009, was also guest in Diaconescu's show, where he talked about politics and personal affairs. Diaconescu's support for BƒÉsescu ended abruptly in 2010 when the television personality was arrested for allegedly having blackmailed a Romanian mayor. After his release, a few days later, Diaconescu announced that he would enter politics and set up his own political party. After Diaconescu's announcement that he would enter politics, the subjects debated on his show started to deal with cases of alleged corruption of various politicians, which the station called ciocoi (roughly meaning fleecer) and to criticise national institutions and state-level decisions which were thought to be against the people, while preparing the ground for the new political party, which was to be called Partidul Poporului (People's Party) by announcing the measures and reforms that the party would take after having reached power. The first point of the measures plan was that every citizen would be given 20.000 euros upon turning 18 years old, which could be invested as the receiver wished.The 20 points of the People's Party The station soon started calling itself Televiziunea Poporului (People's Television) and Dan Diaconescu started being called the future president of Romania.

After an appeal by Diaconescu at the Bucharest Appeal Court, all the sanctions on OTV's licence were lifted, leaving OTV with its broadcast licence lasting until 2013.SurprizƒÉ: OTV nu se mai √Ænchide! - RTV.net = Second licence retraction and the Vatican-based television = In January 2013, after the members of the Council were reelected, a review of the fines not paid by television stations over the last few years was made. It has been calculated that OTV had not paid fines totalling over 1 million lei.http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/dupa-634000-de-euro-amenzi-date-de-cna- otv-se-inchide-1020445.html Within three hours from the receipt of the decision from the Council, the broadcast ceased on cable. Shortly afterwards, an online live stream broadcasting the channel was set up and is live as of March 2013. OTV now airs mostly reruns and recordings of Diaconescu's appearances on other TV stations, notably Rom√¢nia TV. Diaconescu made an attempt at circumventing the decision of the Council by settling the television in the city of Vatican, with the Vatican-based OTV broadcasting most of its shows from the studios in Romania, but under the name of a foreign company. Even so, OTV is not viewable in most Romanian networks. = OTV Live on Rom√¢nia TV = On 15 July 2014, 533 days after OTV's broadcast interruption, Dan Diaconescu relaunched his flagship show under a different name, OTV Live, after an agreement with the news television station Rom√¢nia TV. Diaconescu stated that he chose Rom√¢nia TV because \\"of the news television stations, Rom√¢nia TV was closest to the pattern of [the former] OTV\\", \\"studies [had] shown that much of OTV's audience turned to Rom√¢nia TV\\", and called the agreement a 'barter', since Rom√¢nia TV would broadcast the show throughout the night and the Vatican-based OTV would also retransmit shows produced by Rom√¢nia TV in the rest of the day.EXCLUSIV.

Reacting to the decision, Diaconescu stated that \\"they have shut down my TV station, they have shut down my party, now they shut me behind bars\\".  Dan Diaconescu Direct  Dan Diaconescu Direct, often shortened to DDD, was by far the best-known show of the station, and had been the main show of the station since its start. Resembling a talk- show format, moderated usually by Dan Diaconescu, the owner of OTV, it debated various subjects, often controversial in nature, in a sensationalistic approach. Subjects debated included scandals among Romanian celebrities, revelations of alleged religious figures, scenarios of a looming earthquake or doomsday, various conspiracy theories, events in the life of LGBT people, investigation into \\"mystery\\" crimes and, later, alleged cases of corruption of dignitaries. Many of the guests who have appeared on Diaconescu's show were recurring and some have gained popularity just because of their appearances on the show. It was broadcast daily and started at about 8 PM. The ending time has not been a fixed one; the show had sometimes continued throughout the night until early morning hours.Video recording showing other two guests (aspiring manele singers), singing and dancing on Diaconescu's show at 4 AM At times, the entire show or part of it was in fact a rebroadcast of a previous one. = Setting = In its beginning, the show was set in a relatively small studio which was in fact a room in the bachelor's apartment from where OTV was broadcasting.Dan Diaconescu a investit 7 milioane de euro in noul sediu OTV - Ziare.com Because of this, OTV was often ironically called by press \\"the bachelor-room\\".http://www.gandul.info/magazin/dan-diaconescu-isi-renoveaza- garsoniera-la-otv-vom-avea-decoruri-fastuoase-si-invitati-mari-din-alte- televiziuni-4602417 After the station relaunch which took place on 15 September 2009, the show had a large studio, whose table is shaped in the form of a lowercase d letter and also has a stage and a video wall. = Unusual events and appearances on the show = The live show has been the stage of many unusual events. One of them was the live \\"trial\\" of an alleged spiritual medium, called Mrs. Ildiko.Video of Mrs Ildiko at OTV She claimed to possess paranormal abilities when covering her head in a bulky bunch of towels. To prove her capabilities, Diaconescu wrote several times some words on a piece of paper apparently without her seeing or knowing them, and asked her to reproduce them using her medium powers, each time with alleged success. As Mrs. Ildiko was using her \\"paranormal abilities\\" to find out the secret words, horror music was being played in the background and lights in the studio were rapidly being switched on and off by the show crew, for effect. Ildiko's appearances on the show have been mocked many times on satire shows of concurrent TV channels. Another unusual event was the live arrest of a man who allegedly had broken out of prison. The arrest took place during the live show in the show's studio, and the man tried to commit suicide before being immobilised.Video recording of the live arrest of an alleged escaped prisoner, during the show Another unusual and controversial event that was broadcast live during the show was an apparent aggression of the show's host, Dan Diaconescu, by a recurrent guest who claimed he was disturbed by Diaconescu's insistence to invite him on the show. The aggressor brought a garbage can in the studio and tried to throw Diaconescu into it, without success.Video recording of the alleged aggression of Diaconescu This was regarded by many internet users as a staging, taking into account that neither the reaction of Diaconescu himself nor that of the other guests in the studio nor that of the studio crew to the incident was very strong. Several times during late night hours, Diaconescu had some of his guests dance on manele during the show on the table in the studio.Video recording showing a guest dancing during on manele during Diaconescu's showVideo recording showing a guest dancing during on manele during Diaconescu's show References External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20180517121206/http://www.oglinda.home.ro/ Category:Defunct television channels in Romania Category:2000 establishments in Romania Category:2013 disestablishments in Romania Category:Television channels and stations established in 2000 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2013 ","title":"OTV (Romanian TV channel)"},{"id":"5698077","text":"Graat v R, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819, is the leading case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada on the admissibility of opinion evidence. The Court held that lay persons may give opinion evidence, which is normally reserved only for expert witnesses, where the opinion so closely infers fact that it is a \\"compendious statement of fact\\". The determination is left to the discretion of the trial judge. Background Anthony Graat was pulled over by London, Ontario police. To the officers he appeared intoxicated and so was arrested for impaired driving. At the scene of the arrest Graat complained of chest pains and so was taken to the hospital. Due to the stop at the hospital the two-hour limit in which to get a breathalyzer test expired. At trial the only evidence the Crown could lead with was the testimony of the police officers. The defence tried to have the evidence excluded as opinion evidence. Graat (1982) Supreme Court found: The witnesses all had an opportunity for personal observations. They were not deciding a matter for the court to decide as the weight of the evidence is entirely a matter for the judge who could accept all or part or none of their evidence. Reasons of the court Justice Dickson, writing for a unanimous court, held that the statements were admissible. Despite their experience, the police officers were not considered experts for determining intoxication and so were limited to giving testimony on observed facts. The trial judge however had discretion to admit certain types of opinion evidence where the distinction between opinion and fact are not clear. Dickson rejected the \\"ultimate issue\\" doctrine, which prohibits opinion evidence on matters that concern the ultimate legal issue of the trial.

Triton was being used to serve budget- oriented games from such publishers as Strategy First and Global Star Software, and was most known for distributing Prey. History Triton was launched on November 10, 2004, under the name Game xStream. The service signed several smaller publishers shortly thereafter, and announced its first high- profile deal in May 2005, signing 3D Realms and its then in-development FPS Prey.

His works are signed J. Muir Auld. James Muir Auld was born in Ashfield, New South Wales, third son of Presbyterian minister, Reverend John Auld and his wife, Georgina n√©e Muir. James Auld attended Ashfield Public School and later, Sydney Grammar School. He worked as a clerk for the Ashfield Borough Council and enrolled in night classes in drawing at Ashfield Technical School. He spent spare time drawing and sketching the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. Artistic career Auld studied under J. S. Watkins and Julian Ashton, and began to exhibit at the Royal Art Society of New South Wales around 1906. He contributed black and white drawings to The Bulletin and The Sydney Mail. In 1909 he travelled to London to study the work of English painters. There he had work accepted for London Opinion and other journals. Returning to Australia about 1911, he worked in Sydney on landscapes and figure subjects, and also did some portraits. On 1 July 1914 Auld married a divorcee Maggie Kate Kane, n√©e Bell. In 1917 The Broken Vase was bought by the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. At about this time, they also purchased a portrait of the poet Roderic Quinn. He joined the Society of Artists, Sydney about 1920 and frequently exhibited with it. In the 1920s, he joined the well-known commercial art firm, Smith and Julius, and illustrated several books. Towards the end of his life Auld spent 11 years at Thirlmere, New South Wales, living alone. The surrounding landscape did not appear to be of an inspiring kind, but Auld's work at this period ranked with his best. Winter Morning was awarded the Wynne Prize in 1935. Auld had three one-man exhibitions at the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, in 1928, 1936 and 1938, and had also exhibited in London and Paris. He was a foundation member of the Australian Academy of Art in 1938. Death and legacy Auld died of tuberculosis on 8 June 1942, survived by a daughter. He was a sound painter in the old traditions, who would not allow himself to be disturbed by the various movements which arose between the two wars. He had good colour, and was especially interested in effects of atmosphere and sunlight, which he expressed with much vitality. He is represented in the Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Manly galleries.

It expresses the probability that one state will pass a test to identify as the other. The fidelity is not a metric on the space of density matrices, but it can be used to define the Bures metric on this space. Given two density operators \\\\rho and \\\\sigma, the fidelity is generally defined as the quantity F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma) = \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sqrt\\\\rho \\\\sigma\\\\sqrt\\\\rho}\\\\right]^2. In the special case where \\\\rho and \\\\sigma represent pure quantum states, namely, \\\\rho=\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho and \\\\sigma=\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\sigma, the definition reduces to the squared overlap between the states: F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma)=\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle^2. While not obvious from the general definition, the fidelity is symmetric: F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma)=F(\\\\sigma,\\\\rho).  Motivation  Given two random variables X,Y with values (1, ..., n) (categorical random variables) and probabilities p = (p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots,p_n) and q = (q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_n), the fidelity of X and Y is defined to be the quantity :F(X,Y) = \\\\left(\\\\sum _i \\\\sqrt{p_i q_i}\\\\right)^2. The fidelity deals with the marginal distribution of the random variables. It says nothing about the joint distribution of those variables. In other words, the fidelity F(X,Y) is the square of the inner product of (\\\\sqrt{p_1}, \\\\ldots ,\\\\sqrt{p_n}) and (\\\\sqrt{q_1}, \\\\ldots ,\\\\sqrt{q_n}) viewed as vectors in Euclidean space. Notice that F(X,Y) = 1 if and only if p = q. In general, 0 \\\\leq F(X,Y) \\\\leq 1. The measure \\\\sum _i \\\\sqrt{p_i q_i} is known as the Bhattacharyya coefficient. Given a classical measure of the distinguishability of two probability distributions, one can motivate a measure of distinguishability of two quantum states as follows. If an experimenter is attempting to determine whether a quantum state is either of two possibilities \\\\rho or \\\\sigma, the most general possible measurement they can make on the state is a POVM, which is described by a set of Hermitian positive semidefinite operators \\\\\\\\{F_i\\\\\\\\} . If the state given to the experimenter is \\\\rho, they will witness outcome i with probability p_i = \\\\operatorname{tr}( \\\\rho F_i ), and likewise with probability q_i = \\\\operatorname{tr}( \\\\sigma F_i ) for \\\\sigma. Their ability to distinguish between the quantum states \\\\rho and \\\\sigma is then equivalent to their ability to distinguish between the classical probability distributions p and q. Naturally, the experimenter will choose the best POVM he can find, so this motivates defining the quantum fidelity as the squared Bhattacharyya coefficient when extremized over all possible POVMs \\\\\\\\{F_i\\\\\\\\} : :F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) = \\\\min_{\\\\\\\\{F_i\\\\\\\\}} F(X,Y) = \\\\min_{\\\\\\\\{F_i\\\\\\\\}} \\\\left(\\\\sum _i \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{tr}( \\\\rho F_i ) \\\\operatorname{tr}( \\\\sigma F_i )}\\\\right)^{2}. It was shown by Fuchs and Caves that this manifestly symmetric definition is equivalent to the simple asymmetric formula given in the next section.C. A. Fuchs, C. M. Caves: \\"Ensemble-Dependent Bounds for Accessible Information in Quantum Mechanics\\", Physical Review Letters 73, 3047(1994)  Definition  Given two density matrices œÅ and œÉ, the fidelity is defined by R. Jozsa, Fidelity for Mixed Quantum States, J. Mod. Opt. 41, 2315--2323 (1994). DOI: http://doi.org/10.1080/09500349414552171 :F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma) = \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho} \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho}}\\\\right)^2, where, for a positive semidefinite matrix M, \\\\sqrt{M} denotes its unique positive square root, as given by the spectral theorem. The Euclidean inner product from the classical definition is replaced by the Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt inner product. Some of the important properties of the quantum state fidelity are: * Symmetry. F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma)=F(\\\\sigma,\\\\rho). * Bounded values. For any \\\\rho and \\\\sigma, 0\\\\le F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) \\\\le 1, and F(\\\\rho,\\\\rho)=1. * Consistency with fidelity between probability distributions. If \\\\rho and \\\\sigma commute, the definition simplifies to F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) = \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho\\\\sigma}\\\\right]^2 = \\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\sqrt{p_k q_k} \\\\right)^2 = F(\\\\boldsymbol p, \\\\boldsymbol q),where p_k, q_k are the eigenvalues of \\\\rho,\\\\sigma, respectively. To see this, remember that if [\\\\rho,\\\\sigma]=0 then they can be diagonalized in the same basis: \\\\rho = \\\\sum_i p_i  i \\\\rangle \\\\langle i  \\\\text{ and } \\\\sigma = \\\\sum_i q_i  i \\\\rangle \\\\langle i ,so that \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} = \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\sqrt{p_k q_k} i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle i\\\\right) = \\\\sum_k \\\\sqrt{p_k q_k}. * Simplified expressions for pure states. If \\\\rho is pure, \\\\rho=\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho, then F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) = \\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\sigma\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\rangle. This follows from F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma) = \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\sqrt{  \\\\psi_\\\\rho \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\rho  \\\\sigma  \\\\psi_\\\\rho \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\rho } \\\\right)^2 = \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\rho  \\\\sigma  \\\\psi_\\\\rho \\\\rangle \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\sqrt{  \\\\psi_\\\\rho \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\rho } \\\\right)^2 = \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\rho  \\\\sigma  \\\\psi_\\\\rho \\\\rangle. If both \\\\rho and \\\\sigma are pure, \\\\rho=\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho and \\\\sigma=\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\sigma, then F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma) = \\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle^2. This follows immediately from the above expression for \\\\rho pure. * Equivalent expression. An equivalent expression for the fidelity may be written, using the trace norm :F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma)= \\\\lVert \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma} \\\\rVert_\\\\operatorname{tr}^2 = \\\\Big(\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma\\\\Big)^2, where the absolute value of an operator is here defined as A\\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{A^\\\\dagger A}. * Explicit expression for qubits. If \\\\rho and \\\\sigma are both qubit states, the fidelity can be computed as M. H√ºbner, Explicit Computation of the Bures Distance for Density Matrices, Phys. Lett. A 163, 239--242 (1992). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/0375-9601%2892%2991004-B :F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\rho\\\\sigma)+2\\\\sqrt{\\\\det(\\\\rho)\\\\det(\\\\sigma)}. Qubit state means that \\\\rho and \\\\sigma are represented by two-dimensional matrices. This result follows noticing that M=\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho}\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho} is a positive semidefinite operator, hence \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt{M}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_1}+\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_2}, where \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 are the (nonnegative) eigenvalues of M. If \\\\rho (or \\\\sigma) is pure, this result is simplified further to F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\rho\\\\sigma) since \\\\mathrm{Det}(\\\\rho) = 0 for pure states. = Alternative definition = Some authors use an alternative definition F':=\\\\sqrt{F} and call this quantity fidelity. The definition of F however is more common. To avoid confusion, F' could be called \\"square root fidelity\\". In any case it is advisable to clarify the adopted definition whenever the fidelity is employed.  Other properties  = Unitary invariance = Direct calculation shows that the fidelity is preserved by unitary evolution, i.e. :\\\\; F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma) = F(U \\\\rho \\\\; U^*, U \\\\sigma U^*) for any unitary operator U. = Uhlmann's theorem = We saw that for two pure states, their fidelity coincides with the overlap. Uhlmann's theorem generalizes this statement to mixed states, in terms of their purifications: Theorem Let œÅ and œÉ be density matrices acting on Cn. Let œÅ be the unique positive square root of œÅ and  \\\\psi _{\\\\rho} \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\rho^{{1}/{2}}  e_i \\\\rangle) \\\\otimes  e_i \\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\otimes \\\\mathbb{C}^n be a purification of œÅ (therefore \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{e_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\} is an orthonormal basis), then the following equality holds: :F(\\\\rho, \\\\sigma) = \\\\max_{\\\\psi_{\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle}  \\\\langle \\\\psi _{\\\\rho} \\\\psi _{\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle ^2 where  \\\\psi _{\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle is a purification of œÉ. Therefore, in general, the fidelity is the maximum overlap between purifications. Sketch of proof A simple proof can be sketched as follows. Let \\\\textstyle \\\\Omega\\\\rangle denote the vector : \\\\Omega \\\\rangle= \\\\sum_{i=1}^n  e_i \\\\rangle \\\\otimes  e_i \\\\rangle and œÉ be the unique positive square root of œÉ. We see that, due to the unitary freedom in square root factorizations and choosing orthonormal bases, an arbitrary purification of œÉ is of the form : \\\\psi_{\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle = ( \\\\sigma^{{1}/{2}} V_1 \\\\otimes V_2 )  \\\\Omega \\\\rangle where Vi's are unitary operators. Now we directly calculate :  \\\\langle \\\\psi _{\\\\rho} \\\\psi _{\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle ^2 =  \\\\langle \\\\Omega  ( \\\\rho^{{1}/{2}} \\\\otimes I) ( \\\\sigma^{{1}/{2}} V_1 \\\\otimes V_2 )  \\\\Omega \\\\rangle ^2 =  \\\\operatorname{tr} ( \\\\rho^{{1}/{2}} \\\\sigma^{{1}/{2}} V_1 V_2^T )^2. But in general, for any square matrix A and unitary U, it is true that tr(AU) ‚â§ tr((A*A)). Furthermore, equality is achieved if U* is the unitary operator in the polar decomposition of A. From this follows directly Uhlmann's theorem.  Proof with explicit decompositions  We will here provide an alternative, explicit way to prove Uhlmann's theorem. Let \\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\rangle and \\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle be purifications of \\\\rho and \\\\sigma, respectively. To start, let us show that \\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle\\\\le\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma. The general form of the purifications of the states is:\\\\begin{align} \\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\rangle &=\\\\sum_k\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_k}\\\\lambda_k\\\\rangle\\\\otimesu_k\\\\rangle, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle &=\\\\sum_k\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_k}\\\\mu_k\\\\rangle\\\\otimesv_k\\\\rangle, \\\\end{align}were \\\\lambda_k\\\\rangle, \\\\mu_k\\\\rangle are the eigenvectors of \\\\rho,\\\\ \\\\sigma, and \\\\\\\\{u_k\\\\\\\\}_k, \\\\\\\\{v_k\\\\\\\\}_k are arbitrary orthonormal bases. The overlap between the purifications is\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{jk}\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_j\\\\mu_k} \\\\langle\\\\lambda_j\\\\mu_k\\\\rangle\\\\,\\\\langle u_jv_k\\\\rangle = \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma U\\\\right),where the unitary matrix U is defined asU=\\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\mu_k\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle u_k \\\\right)\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\sum_j v_j\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle \\\\lambda_j\\\\right).The conclusion is now reached via using the inequality \\\\operatorname{tr}(AU)\\\\le \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\sqrt{A^\\\\dagger A})\\\\equiv\\\\operatorname{tr}A: \\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle= \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma U) \\\\le \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma.Note that this inequality is the triangle inequality applied to the singular values of the matrix. Indeed, for a generic matrix A\\\\equiv \\\\sum_j s_j(A)a_j\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle b_jand unitary U=\\\\sum_j b_j\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle w_j, we have\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{tr}(AU) &= \\\\left\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(\\\\sum_j s_j(A)a_j\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle b_j \\\\,\\\\,\\\\sum_k b_k\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle w_k \\\\right)\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left\\\\sum_j s_j(A)\\\\langle w_ja_j\\\\rangle\\\\right\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le \\\\sum_j s_j(A) \\\\,\\\\langle w_ja_j\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le \\\\sum_j s_j(A) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{tr}A, \\\\end{align}where s_j(A)\\\\ge 0 are the (always real and non-negative) singular values of A, as in the singular value decomposition. The inequality is saturated and becomes an equality when \\\\langle w_ja_j\\\\rangle=1, that is, when U=\\\\sum_k b_k\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\!\\\\langle a_k, and thus AU=\\\\sqrt{AA^\\\\dagger}\\\\equiv A. The above shows that \\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle= \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma when the purifications \\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\rangle and \\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle are such that \\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma U=\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma. Because this choice is possible regardless of the states, we can finally conclude that\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma=\\\\max\\\\langle\\\\psi_\\\\rho\\\\psi_\\\\sigma\\\\rangle.  Consequences  Some immediate consequences of Uhlmann's theorem are * Fidelity is symmetric in its arguments, i.e. F (œÅ,œÉ) = F (œÉ,œÅ). Note that this is not obvious from the original definition. * F (œÅ,œÉ) lies in [0,1], by the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality. * F (œÅ,œÉ) = 1 if and only if œÅ = œÉ, since Œ®œÅ = Œ®œÉ implies œÅ = œÉ. So we can see that fidelity behaves almost like a metric. This can be formalized and made useful by defining : \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} = F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma) \\\\, As the angle between the states \\\\rho and \\\\sigma. It follows from the above properties that \\\\theta_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} is non-negative, symmetric in its inputs, and is equal to zero if and only if \\\\rho = \\\\sigma. Furthermore, it can be proved that it obeys the triangle inequality, so this angle is a metric on the state space: the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric.K. ≈ªyczkowski, I. Bengtsson, Geometry of Quantum States, Cambridge University Press, 2008, 131 = Relationship with the fidelity between the corresponding probability distributions = Let \\\\\\\\{E_k\\\\\\\\}_k be an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM); that is, a set of operators E_k satisfying \\\\sum_k E_k=I, E_j E_k = \\\\delta_{jk} E_j, and E_k^2 = E_k. Then, for any pair of states \\\\rho and \\\\sigma, we have \\\\sqrt{F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma)} \\\\le \\\\sum_k \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{tr}(E_k\\\\rho)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{tr}(E_k\\\\sigma)} \\\\equiv \\\\sum_k \\\\sqrt{p_k q_k}, where in the last step we denoted with p_k, q_k the probability distributions obtained by measuring \\\\rho,\\\\ \\\\sigma with the POVM \\\\\\\\{E_k\\\\\\\\}_k. This shows that the square root of the fidelity between two quantum states is upper bounded by the Bhattacharyya coefficient between the corresponding probability distributions in any possible POVM. Indeed, it is more generally true that F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma)=\\\\min_{\\\\\\\\{E_k\\\\\\\\}} F(\\\\boldsymbol p,\\\\boldsymbol q), where F(\\\\boldsymbol p, \\\\boldsymbol q)\\\\equiv\\\\left(\\\\sum_k\\\\sqrt{p_k q_k}\\\\right)^2, and the minimum is taken over all possible POVMs.  Proof of inequality  As was previously shown, the square root of the fidelity can be written as \\\\sqrt{F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma)}=\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma,which is equivalent to the existence of a unitary operator U such that \\\\sqrt{F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma)}=\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma U).Remembering that \\\\sum_k E_k=I holds true for any POVM, we can then write\\\\sqrt{F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma)}=\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\sqrt\\\\rho\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma U)= \\\\sum_k\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\sqrt\\\\rho E_k E_k\\\\sqrt\\\\sigma U) \\\\le \\\\sum_k\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{tr}(E_k\\\\rho)\\\\operatorname{tr}(E_k \\\\sigma)},where in the last step we used Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as in \\\\operatorname{tr}(A^\\\\dagger B)^2\\\\le\\\\operatorname{tr}(A^\\\\dagger A)\\\\operatorname{tr}(B^\\\\dagger B). = Behavior under quantum operations = The fidelity between two states can be shown to never decrease when a non- selective quantum operation \\\\mathcal E is applied to the states:F(\\\\mathcal E(\\\\rho),\\\\mathcal E(\\\\sigma)) \\\\ge F(\\\\rho,\\\\sigma), for any trace-preserving completely positive map \\\\mathcal E. = Relationship to trace distance = We can define the trace distance between two matrices A and B in terms of the trace norm by : D(A,B) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ A-B\\\\_{\\\\rm tr} \\\\, . When A and B are both density operators, this is a quantum generalization of the statistical distance. This is relevant because the trace distance provides upper and lower bounds on the fidelity as quantified by the Fuchs‚Äìvan de Graaf inequalities,C. A.

His mother, Margareta Karoline (n√©e Reischb√∂ck) grew up in Franconia and Lower Bavaria. Both of them were Roman Catholics, but the mother converted from Protestantism at some point. Karlheinz, the eldest of three children, attended elementary school in Trossenfurt (close to W√ºrzburg) from 1929 to 1933. Afterwards he attended the Franciscan Seminary in Dettelbach. There he first lived with the family of his godfather and sponsor, the clerical councilor Leopold Baumann, afterward in the Franciscan monastery. From 1934 to 1942 he attended the Alte, Neue and Deutsche Gymnasium as a boarding school student with the Carmelite and English Sisters. In 1942 he passed his final exams. Like the rest of his entire class he reported immediately as a military volunteer and was wounded several times. He served as a soldier until Germany's capitulation, in the final stages as a paratrooper. Initially matriculating as a major in Forestry in the University of Munich, Deschner attended lectures on Law, Theology, Philosophy and Psychology during 1946/47 at the Philosophical-Theological College in Bamberg. From 1947 to 1951 at the University of W√ºrzburg he studied Contemporary German Literature, Philosophy and History and graduated in 1951 with a doctoral dissertation entitled Lenau's Lyrics As an Expression of Metaphysical Despair. In the same year he married Elfi Tuch. They had three children: Katja (1951), B√§rbel (1958) and Thomas (1959 to 1984). From 1924 to 1964 Deschner resided in a former hunting lodge of the prince-bishops of Tretzendorf (Steigerwald), then for two years in the country house of a friend in Fischbrunn (near Hersbruck, Franconian Jura). After that, he resided in Hassfurt am Main until his death. Karlheinz Deschner published novels, literary criticism, essays, aphorisms, and history critical of religion and the Church. Over the years he gave more than 2,000 public lectures. In 1971 he was called before court in Nuremberg, charged with \\"Insults against the Church\\", but was acquitted. Outside of Germany, his works remained largely unpublished until the eighties, when translated versions (where necessary) were published in Spain, Switzerland, Italy and Poland. (The fourth part of The Cock Crowed Once Again was translated into Norwegian and published in 1972). Deschner worked on his ambitious Criminal History of Christianity from 1970 to 2013.Karlheinz Deschner Kriminalgeschichte des Christentums Rowohlt Magazin rowohlt.de (in German) He had no official research grants, honoraria, stipends, emoluments or official positions, but had been financially supported by a few friends and readers. His friend and patron Alfred Schwarz was able to celebrate the appearance of Volume 1 in September 1986 but did not live to see Volume 2 reach publication. The German entrepreneur Herbert Steffen, founder of the humanistic Giordano Bruno Foundation has continued to support Deschner's work. In 1989 German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel published a recension of the first two volumes.

Coon's theories.  Biography  =Early life and education= Henry Bertrand Marie Armand de Lesquen du Plessis-Casso was born on 1 January 1949 in Port-Lyautey, Morocco, then a French protectorate, the son of Pierre de Lesquen du Plessis-Casso, a general of the French Army and Anne-Marie Huon de Kermadec. Both his father and mother were from noble Breton families. De Lesquen's maternal grand-mother, Camille Medina, was born Guatemalan and naturalized French.

Criticizing the meta- politics of Alain de Benoist's GRECE, the Club de l'Horloge aimed at concrete results, favoring entryism inside the French mainstream right-wing parties of the period: the Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the Union for French Democracy. The book La Politique du vivant (\\"The Politics of living\\"), published in 1979 under the direction of De Lesquen, drew influence from GRECE theories on sociobiology, genetic determinism and social darwinism. The same year, he participated with Alain de Benoist in the French TV literary talk show Apostrophes about the Nouvelle Droite. Since the years 1979-80, the Club de l'Horloge has distanced itself from GRECE, promoting instead an \\"economic liberalism strongly tainted with nationalism.\\"Mathieu Laurent, Les Structures non-partisanes dans le champ politique (th√®se de doctorat en science politique), universit√© Paris-IV, 2011, p. 101. = Public career = From 1974 to 1978, De Lesquen has been in charge of the program bureau for the French highways at the Ministry of Equipment.http://www.histoire-dac.developpement- durable.gouv.fr/structure/pdf/1976.pdf He became head of the bureau of energies, raw materials and chemistry at the Ministry of Finances from 1979 to 1983.‚ÄúHenry de Lesquen du Plessis Casso‚Äù, in Who's Who in France, 2013, p. 1384 De Lesquen has been also a lecturer in economics at Sciences Po from 1978 to 1987.

In 2001, De Lesquen became a municipal councilor in Versailles, where he spoke out against the city's public housing projects. In 2007, he has been elected president of right-wing radio station Radio Courtoisie, from which he was ousted in 2017 after the controversies surrounding his presidential campaign.  2017 presidential election  At the end of 2015, De Lesquen announced his candidacy to the 2017 presidential election. In the following months, he attracted media attention by making a number of provocative proposals, claiming that as president, he would destroy the Eiffel Tower; \\"burn\\" France's labour code, which he consider an obstacle to entrepreneurship and as stifling individual liberty, and annex Belgium and Luxembourg. De Lesquen also added that he would ban \\"negro music\\" from government-sponsored broadcasts‚Äîin his view the \\"music with a sexual rhythm, expression of the soul of the African people\\"; including hip-hop, metal and rock and roll, which he described as \\"white people's negro music, that appeals to the reptilian brain\\".Pr√©sidentielle : Henry de Lesquen, ce candidat qui veut ¬´ bannir la musique n√®gre ¬ª et revenir au 19√®me si√®cle, L'Obs, 12 April 2016Henry de Lesquen, au nom de la race, Lib√©ration, 26 April 2016 He was eventually sentenced to a 16,000-euro fine in January 2017 for incitement to racial hatred and holocaust denial.Henry de Lesquen condamn√© √† 16 000 euros d'amende, L'Express, 25 January 2017 In March 2017, De Lesquen withdrew his candidacy in favor of LR runner Fran√ßois Fillon,Le nouveau soutien (tr√®s encombrant) de Fran√ßois Fillon, LCI, 3 March 2017 against the \\"cosmopolitan oligarchy\\" and to \\"stand in the way of Macron\\". = Online fame and influence = Lesquen runs a Youtube channel, totalling several million views, in which he expresses his political theories and has attracted a lot of young people who label themselves the Jeunesses Lesquenistes (\\"Lesquenist Youth\\"). He founded a political movement in 2018, the National-Liberal party (PNL; French \\"Parti National-Lib√©ral\\"), which aims at promoting national liberal ideas,Philippe Lamy (sous la dir. de Claude Dargent), (th√®se de doctorat en sociologie), Paris, universit√© Paris-VIII, 2016, pp. 373-74. and restoring traditional French values and liberal economics through ideological influence rather than elected office. Using irony and provocative symbolism akin to the Alt-Right movement, the logo of his party imitates the Wolfsangel used by the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich in WWII. Through his online videos, Lesquen participated in popularizing the concept of \\"remigration\\" in France and spreading racialist theories built on anthropologist Carleton S. Coon's works.

He remained a member of the Box Tops until August 1969, when he decided to return to school to get a music degree in performance of the upright bass. Though Cunningham virtually vanished from the pop music scene after he left the Box Tops, he rose in the ranks of classical musicians, playing in many symphony orchestras (including the Memphis Symphony) and in ballet and opera companies while attending university. During this period he backed artists as diverse as Eddy Arnold, Van Cliburn, Isaac Hayes, the Romeros (Spanish guitarists), Dionne Warwick, and Itzhak Perlman. Cunningham studied in Philadelphia Pennsylvania with Roger Scott, the principal bassist under Eugene Ormandy, in the mid- to late-1970s. Cunningham played on a number of string sessions for STAX and other Memphis recording artists. One example can be heard on Chris Bell's (Big Star) song \\"You and Your Sister,\\" featuring Bell's guitar work and vocals, Alex Chilton backing vocal, and Cunningham's string arrangements and upright bass work. In 1996, Cunningham played the principal role in reforming the original Box Tops. He played bass and shared responsibility for keyboard parts with John Evans on the Tear Off album.

Magnificent Riflebirds are widely distributed throughout lowland rainforests of western New Guinea and the northern Cape York Peninsula. A widespread and relatively common species throughout its range, the magnificent riflebird is evaluated as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.  Taxonomy and systematics  This species used to be placed in its own genus, Craspedophora Gray, 1840, which is now a subgenus of Ptiloris. The common name \\"riflebird\\" comes from the likeness of their black velvety plumage to the uniform of the British Army Rifle Brigade.Nominate male specimen at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Note its brilliant, scaly, iridescent, delta- shaped breast plate. Description This riflebird is a medium-sized bird, being up to 34 cm long. The male is velvet-black bird-of-paradise with elongated black filamental flank plumes, an iridescent blue-green crown, a wide, triangle-shaped breast shield, and on central tail feathers. It has a black curved bill, yellow mouth, blackish feet and a dark brown iris. The female is brownish with dark spots and buff bars below with a white brow. The immature male resembles the male but with less tail plumes.  Behavior and Biology  The diet of the magnificent riflebird consists mainly of fruits and a variety of invertebrates such as spiders, millipedes, etc. Males are polygamous and perform solitary courtship displays on a 'dancing perch'. During these displays, the male fully extends his wings and raises his tail; he jerks upward while swinging his head from side to side, showing off his metallic blue-green breast shield, and producing a distinctive \\"woosh\\" sound as he flaps his wings. Multiple females will observe these displays, and, if satisfied with the performance, reward the male with mating rights. Females subsequently build nests, incubate, brood, and feed young without male assistance.Nominate female at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Note the exceptional sexual dimorphism present in the species. Taxonomy and Subspecies Now considered a separate species, the Growling Riflebird (Ptiloris intercedens) is still occasionally considered conspecific with the Magnificent Riflebird, though genetic analysis proved it to merit specific status.

It was written and directed by Vicente Aranda. In 1936, Maria (Ariadna Gil), a young nun is recruited by Pilar (Ana Bel√©n), a militant feminist, into an anarchist militia following the onset of the Spanish Civil War. Guided by the older woman, Maria is exposed to the realities of war and revolution, and comes to question her former, sheltered life. Plot summary The movie is set in 1936 in Barcelona in the midst of the Spanish Revolution and Spanish Civil War.Sandra Brennan, Rovi. Libertarias (1996) New York Times Militia women Pilar (Ana Belen) and Floren (Victoria Abril) are joined by former prostitute Charo (Loles Leon) and former nun Maria (Ariadna Gil), who had hidden in a brothel to escape revolutionary violence against clergy. The film opens with scenes of working class militants demolishing and burning religious icons, as they shout \\"down with Capitalism!\\" and \\"long live the libertarian revolution!\\" While fully immersed in the overall enthusiasm of revolutionary Spain, Pilar and friends find themselves fighting against deep gender inequality which complicates their efforts in the war against Francisco Franco's Nationalist/Fascist/Catholic forces. They encounter resistance even within their own \\"Free Women\\" (Mujeres Libres) organization as one woman (that resembles Federica Montseny) tries to persuade them to stay and work in defense factories, while men try to convince them to go work as cooks, not front-line soldiers. Cast and characters * Mar√≠a (Ariadna Gil) is a young, sheltered woman, Maria is swept into the confusion and euphoria of the initial days of the Spanish Civil War, when her convent is overrun by anarchist militiamen. Fearing for her life, as she believes the men mean her harm, she seeks refuge amongst the back alleys of the city, only to be given shelter in a brothel. Minutes later, the same building is stormed by militia-women, and the stern faced Pilar. When the brothel is closed, Maria is left with nowhere to go. Fearing for her safety, she stays by Pilar's side, hoping the stronger woman can shield her from the realities of a war, and a social revolution, she does not understand. Overtime she comes to sympathize with the anarchists who she has joined, blending her own beliefs of heaven and paradise with an anarchist desire for a communal society founded on liberation. Though she never picks up a rifle for their cause, she ultimately becomes strong enough for a final reversal of roles, as she gives shelter to Pilar in the final moments of the movie. * Pilar (Ana Bel√©n) is a confident anarcha-feminist, Mujeres Libres member, and militia soldier, Pilar is a constant source of strength for the characters around her, and a protector of the naive Mar√≠a. After convincing the prostitutes of a brothel to turn their backs on their old lives and become militia soldiers, she takes Maria under her wing, fearing the shy girl will only be in danger as a Catholic in a newly anti-theistic anarchist society. Disguising the girl as a fellow anarchist, she takes Maria as a ward and leads a small troop of militia soldiers into battle against the forces of Franco. * Victoria Abril as Floren * Blanca Apil√°nez as Aura * Laura Ma√±√° as Concha * Loles Le√≥n as Charo * Jorge Sanz as Obrero Hijo * Jos√© Sancho as Obrero padre * Joan Crosas as Boina * Antonio Dechent as Faneca Reception Time Out stated that the movie \\"deserves praise for its feminist perspective on the course of the 1936-7 revolution, when women's liberation was a logical, if hardly well-recognised, constituent of the libertarian ideals that the Spanish working class rose up to assert.\\"Libertarias (1995).

Vicente do Rego Monteiro (December 19, 1899 -- June 5, 1970), born in Recife, was a Brazilian painter, sculptor, and poet, born to a rich family. He was part of the Semana de Arte Moderna exhibition and helped form the later Brazilian Modernism.  Biography  Vicente do Rego Monteiro was part of a rich Pernambuco family in Recife. His mother was a professor and his father a businessman. He was born December 19, 1899. He was known for being a Brazilian painter, poet and sculptor, by 1911 he went to Paris, in company of his older sister. He attended a course, for little time, at the Acad√©mie Julian, as well as the academies Colarossi and the Grande Chaumi√©re. At those academies he established close friendships with Parisian Modernists. With precocious talent, in 1913 and 1914 he showed his art for the first time by participating in the Hall of the Independent Artists (Salons des Ind√©pendents), in the French capital. He returned to Brazil in 1917, and established himself in Rio de Janeiro and Recife. In Rio de Janeiro he sculpted a bust of Rui Barbosa and a maquette for the heroes of the 1817 revolution monument. The following year Rego Monteiro worked on a drawing series inspired by the dancer Pavlova and created a ballet of indigenous legends of Brazil. Two years later, in Recife, he did his first individual sample, presenting in 1920 and 1921 in Rio de Janeiro, in S√£o Paulo and Recife. Eventually he settled in Recife after a heart attack.  Artistic career  He created a large impact on the Brazilian avant-garde movements, especially after he participated in the 1922 Semana da Arte Moderna in S√£o Paulo which ignited new trends in the Brazilian Modernism movement. From 1922 to 1930 Vicente do Rego Monteiro was associated with L√©once Rosenberg's Gal√©rie de l'effort Moderne, showing in a variety of solo exhibitions. He illustrated two books depicting modern art centered on the regional culture of Brazilian natives and their traditions; one in 1923: Legendes, croyances et talismans des Indiens de l'Amazone and one in 1925: Quelques Visages de Paris. In Vittel, Rego Monteiro focused on religious themes, influenced by Fernand L√©ger. There was a fire at his studio that destroyed some of his works, but afterwards in 1928, Am√©d√©e Ozenfant suggested Rego Monteiro do a second solo show at the Galerie Bernheim Jeune. He then went back to Paris until 1930. In Paris he produced some of his best art that was known for its tension between universal and vernacular as well as how it appropriated Cubist effects. He would portray legends, talisman, and beliefs of the Amazon River Indians, these themes stayed in his works for the rest of his life. He also challenged in his art the way Parisian artists portrayed Indians as \\"noble savages\\" when they have been the revered symbol of Brazilian republicanism. Rego Monteiro was committed to a native and cosmopolitan approach. He lived and work in busy Paris but drew from the native people of Brazil.. He was supported by Maison de L‚ÄôAmerique Latine and Revue de L‚ÄôAmerique Latine while in Paris, along with Pedro Figari, JoaquŒØn Torres-GarcŒØa and a few other artists.  Later life  In 1930 Rego Monteiro started participating in care races while promoting exhibitions of French art in Brazil. Three years later he returned home to Pernambuco, created an industry of sugarcane schnapps, taught for a while in his home town, becoming the director in 1938 of the Prensa del estado (State Press), then a year later established his own publishing house called Renovac√£o, which lasted from 1939 to 1942. The goal of the publishing house was proletarian education after Getœçlio Vargas's Estado Novo. In 1941 Rego Monteiro published his pocket poems, most of which inspired the Concrete poetry in the next decade. He then went back to Paris where he published Calligrammes and designed covers for La Presse √† Bras, then, after being weakened by a heart attack in 1955, he went back to Brazil and spent the rest of his life teaching at the Instituto Central de Arte da Universidade de BrasŒØlia.  Artistic Movements and Meaning  Modernism was first found in writer's and poets' works such as Oswald de Andrade and M√°rio de Andrade, who also were a part of organizing the Semana de Arte Monderna. It started due to the transforming of S√£o Paulo into the new urban cultural center. S√£o Paulo was rapidly changing, the elite traveled often to Europe and would bring back the latest aesthetic ideas and contemporary art, which spread widely in a short amount of time. Anita Malfatti's art was the final push to put Brazilian Modernism into full swing. Vicente do Rego Monteiro's art was known for its identity based nature. His works focused on showing the true identity of Brazilians and used the natives as way to illustrate it. Rego Monteiro was part of an artist group that focused was centered on modernism using pre- colonization native roots and the regional cultural traditions and stories. The Semana de Arte Moderna was the turning point for Early Brazilian modernism, and from that exhibition sprang Pau-Brazil and Antropofagia. Pau- Brazil was the movement where artists tried to create a uniquely Brazilian art and unique as their paubrasilia wood. There Brazilian art became and showed Brazilian identity that they themselves would export similar to their wood. Soon came Antropofagia, meaning cannibalize. For centuries other countries had been 'consuming' Brazil either by taking their culture for their own art or using the people for one's own work. Brazil artists wanted to take back their culture and have their turn 'consuming' other cultures. Artists would go to Europe learn they could and wanted to learn then go back to Brazil to use their knew knowledge, transforming it into their own unique Brazilian style. Vicente do Rego Monteiro also used Japanese woodblock prints, Art Nouveau, Futurism, Art Deco, African tribal art, barroco mineiro, and indigenous motifs from the Island of Marajœå.  Style  During the early 1920s he started developing his ‚Äúrelief‚Äù style where is paintings looked like sculptures. They are two-dimensional and look like they are carved into the surface. A multitude of his relief paintings were of religious themes such as ‚ÄúA Crucifix√£o‚Äù (The Crucifixion), which is one of his most famous works. \\"A Crucifix√£o\\" and \\"A Descida Da Cruz\\" along with several of his other religious paintings feature figures that are forlorn, mourning, and crying, the color of the paintings also being very muted; which is very different from his brightly colored ceramics of indigenous. Because of their style, most of his religious- themed works are similar to Ivan Mestroviƒá's \\"melancholic deco\\". In his poems, Rego Monteiro was very whimsical with strong humorous undertones that mocked traditional Eurocentric travel narrative. Often he would use hieroglyphs in his poems such as L√©gendes, and tended to write in French, even though it would have Brazilian subject matter.

A group of modern artists decided to put on their own exhibition in S√£o Paulo that represented a different view of Brazilian identity. Writers such as M√°rio de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade and artists Anita Malfatti, Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, John Graz, Martin Ribeiro, Zina, and Vicente do Rego Monteiro participated in the Modern Art Week. They, instead of overwriting the country's past, chose to redefine and exhibit the true Brazilian identity through their arts. * 1928 Solo show at the Galerie Bernheim Jeune * Gal√©rie de l'effort Moderne (1922-1930) * Gal√©rie Zack (1930): The first exhibition of Latin American Artists, organized by JoaquŒØn Torres-GarcŒØa.

Plot Spring Forward is the story of the burgeoning friendship between two very different men, Murphy and Paul, who work for the parks department in a quaint New England town. Paul is a short- tempered ex-convict recently released from prison for armed robbery, who is exploring his spiritual side hoping for atonement and a second chance. On his first day working in parks maintenance he is partnered with Murphy, a veteran groundskeeper, facing his advancing age and impending retirement. The day gets off to a rough start when Paul clashes with a condescending local business heir over a materials donation, loses his cool, announces he is quitting, and stalks off into the woods berating himself for always ruining everything. Murphy follows him, defuses Paul's outburst and convinces him to stay. Against the backdrop of the changing seasons the relationship between the men strengthens and develops more as father and son, poignant in contrast to Murphy's relationship with his dying homosexual son, whose impending death causes Murphy to doubt his past as a father and a man. Working together through mundane days and personal crisis they share their lives, hopes, ambitions and regrets, as Paul learns to find stability and calm in his life and Murphy achieves acceptance and forgiveness for his mistakes.

The Saskatchewan provincial Human Rights Act was found not to apply to potentially discriminatory conduct that was acted as part of criminal law enforcement. Background Frederick Runns and a number of his friends were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in his hunting cabin for the assault of a conservation officer. The suspects were made to lay on the ground without being dressed in sub-zero temperature for approximately half an hour. They were eventually released. Runns and his associates made a complaint to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission for arbitrary arrest. A Board of Inquiry was established to investigate the matter. The issue was whether the provincial Board of Inquiry had jurisdiction to investigate into the conduct of the officers. The issues on appeal to the Supreme Court were: # whether section 7 the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, which allows the investigation of cases of arbitrary arrest or detention, is inoperative under section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867. # Whether the Board of Inquiry is able to adjudicate complaints of the RCMP officers. Opinion of the Court Justice Estey, writing for the majority, allowed the appeal. Estey found that section 7 of Code is inoperative as it concerns matters of criminal law, which is in the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. As such, he did not need to consider the effects of section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Justice Laforest, in dissent, argued that police conduct could fall within the province's property and civil rights power under section 92(13) or likewise within the province's authority over the \\"administration of justice in the province\\" under section 92(14).

He joined the band following the death of Leon Wilkeson. Life and career Evans was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He moved to Columbus, Mississippi, after marrying his wife, Eva.The Clarion-Ledger: Lynyrd Skynryd bassist dies in Columbus He started in music at the age of five, playing trumpet and having an orchestral background until his teen years. Picking up the guitar at 15, soon he was playing the southeastern rock circuit with various cover groups. A few years later he switched to bass so as to bring a fellow guitarist into the band. In the 1980s he played bass for a rock band called \\"Five Miles High\\", along with Mike Reynolds (drummer), Reuban Lace (guitarist), Carl Brown (keyboardist), Del Stockstill (guitar). The group played venues from Georgia to Kentucky and all over the south east. It was rated in the top 10 rock bands of the 1980s in a Mississippi radio station contest. Around 1983 FMH disbanded, and Ean returned to his native Atlanta, Georgia. There he welcomed his newborn daughter and worked on plans to form a new group with close friend keyboardist, Joey Huffman. This project quickly became the band, \\"Babe Blu\\" (with former FMH members Carl Brown, Reuban Lace, and adding JT Williams on drums). Babe Blu immediately become a top draw in Atlanta, and on the southeastern club and college circuit. However, in 1987, Ean left Babe Blu permanently to be home with his young family, and to work on his own original compositions. He studied the styles and techniques of John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin), Geddy Lee (Rush) and Leon Wilkeson (Lynyrd Skynyrd) giving him an aggressive approach to the bass guitar. In 1988, he was picked up by his then personal manager, Jay Jay French of the then recently disbanded Twisted Sister. Evans formed his first original band \\"Cupid's Arrow\\". They became quite popular in the Atlanta area. After composing and recording over 50 songs, Ean became a full-time studio musician. It was during this time he was called to join the Outlaws by leader Hughie Thomasson, who showed him worldwide touring experience. The Outlaws stopped touring when Hughie was called to join Lynyrd Skynyrd. In 1997, Evans and ex- Halloween guitarist (1982‚Äì1988, 1997‚Äì2000) Rick Craig formed \\"Noon\\", which blends metal with southern rock. They released one album in 2002 and many other unreleased recordings exist and are subject to release. In 2000, Evans and Craig joined an ad hoc version of Humble Pie formed by Charlie Huhn to fulfill touring obligations following an injury sustained by original Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley. This version of the band contained no original members. Following the death of Lynyrd Skynyrd bassist Leon Wilkeson, the call came to Ean to continue on for his fallen friend. He joined the current line up of Lynyrd Skynyrd on August 11, 2001, in Las Vegas, Nevada, beginning his own chapter with the band. Death In late 2008 Evans was diagnosed with lung cancer,Ean Evans' cancer diagnosis of which he died on May 6, 2009, at his home in Columbus, Mississippi. He is survived by his wife Eva and their two daughters, Sydney and Andrea. An ailing Evans performed with Skynyrd one last time from a chair on April 19, 2009, at the Mississippi Kid Festival, organized in support of him. Lynyrd Skynyrd continued its 2009 tour with Robert Kearns on bass. He was followed by Johnny Colt from The Black Crowes. Johnny Van Zant asked audiences to pray for Evans.

It was built in 1955 and was the home court for the school's men's basketball program until 1972. The gymnasium has hosted the Providence College women's basketball team since its inception in 1974. History Alumni Hall was built in 1955 to suit the needs of the men's basketball program, under the direction of then-college president Rev. Robert J. Slavin, O.P. The team had previously played either off-campus or in a small gymnasium in the basement of Bishop Harkins Hall (a space which would later become the Blackfriars Theatre). It was dedicated to those alumni who had fought in World War II. For its first seventeen years, it was the home of the burgeoning men's basketball program, which won the 1961 and 1963 NIT championships under coach Joe Mullaney. In 1972, the men's team moved to the new Providence Civic Center downtown, which later became the Dunkin' Donuts Center. In 2001, the gymnasium was named the Mullaney Gymnasium in honor of Mullaney. In 1974, the women's basketball team began playing there, where they currently reside. The gymnasium has hosted several Women's NIT games throughout its tenure, as well as the 1983 (inaugural) and 1993 Big East Women's Basketball Tournaments. On October 31, 2009, the men's basketball team played an exhibition game against Merrimack, its first game in Alumni Hall since January 22, 1978, an exhibition game against the Soviet national basketball team. Until 2012, the arena sat 2,620 fans. Bleacher seating was available on the main level, with theater seating in the upper level. When the men's team played there, Alumni Hall's upper level was traditionally reserved for season ticket holders while the bleacher seating was generally filled with students. The gymnasium underwent renovations in 2012, removing the bleacher seating in favor of theater seating throughout the lower level, reducing the capacity for basketball to 1,854. Video boards were also installed, while the gymnasium became air conditioned for the first time in its history. Other uses The upper levels of the building now house the athletic department's offices. These spaces, along with the locker rooms and playing surface of the gymnasium were renovated in the mid-2000s, including an expansion to house a new training room, the Canavan Sports Medicine Center, on the Cumberland Street side of the building. In 2007, the Concannon Fitness Center opened on the other side of Alumni Hall, along with a glass lobby (the Ruane Atrium) which serves as common entrance for the fitness center, the Slavin Center, Alumni Hall, and the adjacent Peterson Recreation Center. There is a cafeteria in the bottom level which is connected to the Slavin Center student union building. The cafeteria was expanded in 1997, including an area formerly used as a mini-mall. For many years the Alumni Hall cafeteria was known as the \\"day hops\\" cafeteria. At one time half of the student body commuted to campus every day and most ate their lunch and spent between class time in this cafeteria (commuter students were popularly known as \\"day hops\\"). A cafeteria for the on-campus resident students operated and continues to operate out of Raymond Hall. Alumni Hall also housed the on campus post office. It served as the campus student union and was the center of campus activity prior to the construction of the Slavin Center. A part-time Hospital Trust Bank branch also operated near the ticket sales area in the foyer of Alumni Hall. The Slavin Center which is conjoined with Alumni hall opened in 1971 as the student union and many of the Alumni Hall facilities were relocated to that building. The Alumni Hall cafeteria was also the site for many on-campus mixers during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s when girls from all-women Catholic colleges in the region like Emmanuel College, Anna Maria College, Regis College, Salve Regina University, Albertus Magnus College and Saint Joseph College would be bussed in for the dances. The school went co-ed in 1972. The hall also hosted many concerts that featured such musical artists as The Association, the Young Rascals, The Hollies, Diane Warwick, Flip Wilson and the Happenings, Judy Collins and many other popular artists of the day. The upper floors of Alumni hall housed the studios of WDOM AM & FM which were the campus radio stations staffed by students.

About the church The church is still operational and is a category Bhttp://www.northlanarkshire.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=7535&p;=0 listed building.http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/46737/details/kirk+of+shotts+st+catherine+s+chapel+kirk+well+and+martyr+s+grave/ It can be seen from the nearby M8 motorway and is often illuminated at night. The graveyard contains stones from as early as 1624. The nearby Fortissat area contains the remains of the Fortissat Stone, a Covenanter gathering place. Shotts itself contains several Covenanter monuments as does nearby Harthill and Allanton. Kirk O' Shotts, or the more affectionate title \\"The M8 Church\\" for its location on a hillock alongside the busy M8 motorway between Glasgow and Edinburgh, was formerly a Catholic place of worship under the name Saint Catherine's Chapel. Close to 550 years ago Bothwell and Shotts formed one parish which stretched from the Clyde to Linlithgowshire, and from the North to the South Calder. In this large area there were four places of worship, one of which was situated in the middle Bothwellmuir at ‚Äúa desert place called Bertram-Shotts‚Äù. Bertram de Shotts was reputed to be a giant who lived in the area and terrorised travellers on the Glasgow/Edinburgh road. A reward was offered for his capture - dead or alive - which was claimed by William Muirhead who lay in wait for Bertram when the latter came to his favourite drinking place, a spring of water on the hillside above Shottsburn. He hamstrung him and, as the giant lay laughing up at him, he cut off his head with the words, ‚ÄúWill ye laugh-up yet?‚Äù It was on Bertram's plot of land that St. Catherine's Chapel was built in 1450. It was dedicated to ‚Äúthe blessed Virgin and Catherine of Sienna‚Äù. Kate or St Catherine's Well Many have wondered what connection St. Catherine could possibly have with the area. In 1457 the parish of Shotts was detached from Bothwell barony and the eastern half was given to Lord Hamilton, who re-founded and probably rededicated the chapel, also founding a hospital at the same place for the reception of the poor, which he endowed with some lands from Kinneal. His foundation was confirmed by a Bull of Pope Sixtus IV, on 30 April 1476 ‚Äì St. Catherine's Feast Day. This may be the reason for the name. Changes at the chapel After the Reformation of 1560,http://www.reformation-scotland.org.uk/articles/ Kirk o‚ÄôShotts became a Protestant place of worship. The old church of St Catherine's must have suffered many changes and required frequent changes since its foundation, but of these there is no account before 1640. In that year the Presbytery met at Shotts and ordered that the church be repaired and partly rebuilt, but it was more than eight years before the work was completed. The site of the old church is marked by the headstone erected to Samuel Meuros, who was session clerk and school master from 1794 to 1837. He was also Precentor, and it was his wish to be buried where his old desk had stood. On the back of the stone is the following inscription: ‚ÄúHere stood the Precentor‚Äôs desk in the Kirk of Bertram Shottshttp://shottshistory.co.uk/short%20hist.htm which was rebuilt and extended in 1642‚Äù . This stone and the burial ground of the Inglis's of Murdoston, which was inside the old church, give a clear idea of the site. The old church was a long, narrow building about 70 feet long, 25 feet wide, with 16 feet at the east end, designated the ‚Äòquire‚Äô. The pulpit and desk stood on the south side, fronting the pulpit was the common loft, in the east end was Murdoston's loft, and at the west end was Gartness loft. In 1817, the old church having become unsafe and having a seating capacity for only 409 worshippers, it was decided that a larger church with a seating capacity for approximately 1,200 should be built. New building The present church building was opened on 26 October 1821, at a cost of ¬£2,270. Its spire was struck by lightning and completely destroyed on 23 July 1876. The only material link with the old church is the old sandstone baptismal font. It was lost for a number of years, but subsequently found in a pigsty, where it was being used as a feeding trough. After being cleaned and rededicated, it is still used for baptisms today. From 1841, the population of the parish rapidly increased and, with this increase, there was a demand for more churches. The following were opened: *Calderhead Church (1860) *Harthill and Benhar (1877) *Cleland Church (1878) *Caldercruix (1893) The Shotts Revival On Monday 21 June 1630, the celebrated Revival took place. It had been arranged that John Livingstone, then a probationer, should preach in the kirkyard that morning after the Communion weekend. He preached on the text Ezekiel 36:25-26, \\"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.\\" His sermon, which lasted for two and a half hours, was much used by God and changed the hearts of five hundred people that morning. He preached for many years after that, but said that he never again witnessed such a melting of hearts as he did that day in Shotts lonely kirkyard. According to Robert Fleming's account of those days, 'Many were so choked and taken by the heart in hearing the word they have been made to fall over... who afterwards proved most solid and useful Christians.'Cook Faith, Grace in Winter: Rutherford in Verse Banner of Truth Trust, Edinburgh 1989 Covenanters The Fortissat Covenanter's Stone From the signing of the National Covenant in 1638 to the Revolution in 1688, the struggle between Presbyterianism and the Episcopacy went on until it reached its height in the killing times - 1684-1685. Shotts and the adjoining parishes of Monkland and Cambusnethan were strong supporters of the Covenant, and many conventicles were held within their bounds. The principal place for field preachings in the parish of Shotts was on a large moss between Benhar and Starryshaw. It was here at a place once known as the \\"Deer Slunk\\" that Donald Cargill preached on the Sunday after Richard Cameron's death, 26 July 1681. John Kidd also preached here to a large, armed conventicle. Nearby is the large whinstone boulder which has been known since the time of the martyred Alexander Peden as ‚ÄòPeden‚Äôs Stane‚Äô. There is a Covenanter's stone in the kirk yard to a certain William Smith, who fought at Rullion Green in the Pentlands in 1666. In 1678, the Duke of Monmouth, with an army of 10,000 men, camped for ten days at Muirhead, about three miles east of Kirk o‚ÄôShotts. They were on their way by the old bridle road, to Bothwell Bridge where they defeated the Covenanters. It is reckoned that 160 Shotts men took part in the battle; 13 were killed and 33 taken prisoner. The Patronage Act The Patronage Act of 1712, which transferred the right of electing ministers from congregations to the patron, caused a great deal of trouble in the parish. There were at least two forced settlements, the better known that of Rev. Lawrence Wells. His settlement was so unpopular that a number left the church and joined the seceders who in time built a church at Shottsburn. It was not until 1975 that this group returned to the fold by returning to Kirk o‚Äô Shotts. Haunted graveyard thumb The graveyard of the Church is allegedly haunted. A driver reported having hit a mysterious grey dressed man or woman on the road which runs aside the church (the B7066).http://www.haunted-scotland.co.uk/kirk-o-shotts-church However, when the driver got out to check on the injured person they had vanished into the mist they appeared from. This then began the long running ghost tale of \\"The Grey Lady\\" which haunts the graveyard and surrounding woods. St. Catherine's Well or \\"Kate's Well\\" St. Catherine's Well or Kate's Well is a historical natural spring well of significant interest and sits on holy ground at the foot of Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church. The well dates back to the 14th century and derives from the church's former past when it was once a Catholic place of worship as St. Catherines Chapel which has origins from Catherine of Sienna.

Bramston Beach Road passes through the southern part of the northern coastal plain through to the sandy beach there. The small residential and camping area is located at the end of the road by the beach. The southern coastal plain area also features a sandy beach but there are no formed roads through the area, only tracks. It is entirely freehold land used for agriculture, again principally grazing.

There are also crocodiles in the area. Crocodile warning sign, 2018It is a popular spot with caravaners and is a good fishing location and has a slightly older than average population.  History  left The town is named after Sir John Bramston, an early politician in Queensland. In March 1872, after the wreck of The Maria on Bramble reef, one of the groups of survivors landed their raft just to the south of Cooper Point. The Djiru people in the area were exceedingly hospitable in feeding and sheltering this group until Captain John Moresby arrived in the Basilisk to return them to the British settlements further south. This group of survivors spent much of their time at a Djiru village that was located at modern day Bramston Beach. Some Djiru villages in the area consisted of quite large huts with multiple entrances. W.T. Forster, a member of this group of castaways recorded his experiences with the Djiru in a pamphlet published later on in 1872. Forster and some officials returned later to thank the Djiru and give gifts of blankets, but the village was devoid of people due to the Native Police having visited the locality the previous day. The 1998 film, The Thin Red Line, was partially filmed on Bramston Beach. At the 2006 census, Bramston Beach had a population of 196 people. In the , Bramston Beach had a population of 154 people.

The parish is centred from the sea on the north coast of Kent, between the towns of Whitstable and Herne Bay. It is approximately five miles (8 km) north of Canterbury. Over a third of the parish, all of which is the south of its ambit, is woodland. The north-west consists of a business park and superstore. Geography Chestfield & Swalecliffe railway station is on the Chatham Main Line a straight two-track line which marks the northern boundary of the parish. A footpath and a road each lead to Radfall which is a woodland locality of a few houses on two streets in the wooded hills to the south - more than one third of the parish is woodland, and almost all of it was woodland in the Middle Ages, when it contributed greatly to the Forest of Blean. The north-east of the parish is non-residential, having a superstore spanning two buildings and the John Wilson business park. History The Chestfield Barn originated as part of the Chestfield Manor in the 14th century, a possession of the half-brother of William the Conqueror, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. It is believed that the Manor dates back to as early as 1084, particularly as it is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the early part of the 20th century the barn was converted into a golf house by Abe Mitchell, to service the golf course constructed in 1924 by George Reeves.

The two-volume series has been released in the United States by Del Rey Manga. Characters =Pilots= * Kirio Muji: The kind of guy who just drifts through life not turning his head in either direction. He doesn't like his sister much, due to unknown reasons. Kirio also two friends at school, Noru and Tatsuta. Decided to house Q-Ko in his closet when she collapses but doesn't even bother to find out her name right away. Though Kirio is very aloof, he cares about his friends, and has a perverse sense of justice. Such as when he tried to kill the older boys who had injured Tatsuta. Pilots Q-Ko in battle. * Furiko Muji: the sister of Kirio, she is very timid and stays away from her brother by all means necessary. Though the mother is rarely home, and tells Kirio to take care of her. She believes that Kirio is the reason why her mother is never around to take care of her. Furiko also likes books a lot (to the point of skipping school so she can go to the library), and can cook. Suffers from a weak heart, actual disease unknown, and has attacks every so often which cause her to lose consciousness. She pilots AA-ko-sama and attacks Q-Ko and Kirio. * Noru Momozawa: One of Kirio's closest friends, he is wise and is described as \\"arcane\\". He is very young, yet very perceptive and seems to know more than he lets others think. Noru has a tendency to indirectly guide Kirio on the right path and he also has a strong understanding of many of the functions that SS-Ko possesses. He also seems to somehow have knowledge concerning the Universal Child Welfare Organization. He also has a dog, which he states on page 57. He pilots SS-Ko in battle. * Tatsuta Katsumoto: In many ways, Tatsuta is the complete opposite of Kirio. He is extremely anxious and does not react well to stressful situations. He also becomes emotionally invested in situations very easily, which causes him to miscalculate (as when he accidentally pilots his robot into power lines). Tatsuta's eye was permanently injured by older students in a fight, and harbored a deep grudge against them because of the wound. However, when given the chance to kill the students during an alien attack, he prefers to take the more moral route and let them go. However, these moral strides against his need for revenge are negated after he is injured by members of Black Hare at the end of the second book. Also seems to be very uncomfortable around girls, even his own Doll to some extent. He pilots NH-Ko. * Mei Kurozawa: An extremely spunky girl, she looks out for her friend Shiino and tries to get Kirio to care a little more about what affects his actions have on others. She is the pilot of RK-Ko. * Shiino Ino: A kind but weak spirited girl whose brother becomes obsessed with an alien baby he discovered. Initially, Shiino is too timid to board a robot, but she eventually befriends VV-Ko of the infamous ‚ÄòBlack Series‚Äô. * Otayama: An adult photographer (his subjects, most often, are the unwilling young children at Kirio's school) that briefly piloted VV-Ko. Unfortunately for him, the ‚ÄòBlack Series‚Äô dolls are a ‚Äútrap‚Äù as stated by Q-Ko, and he is violently killed after entering the doll. It is also noticed that Otayama looks very similar to Hajime Ueda himself. * Girl from Tomunchap Makes a very brief appearance, and her true name is never known. Is in a flash back on page 114, at the end of chapter 5. After she tells the Chinese soldiers that her doll is a friend, they ask her if she can help them fight the Japanese army. =Other Humans= *Major Ririko Muji: She is Kirio and Furiko's mother, though she is rarely home due to her job. She works in the local branch of the Black Hares. The full extent of her work is never stated, though her main office was in the 'Doll room', where several of the dolls were kept (one of them being RK.KO-chan) 15 years ago Ririko had gone to China where she first saw the dolls. *Lt. Akaza: Another member of the Black Hares. Is an impatient soldier whose real motivations were never truly revealed. Pilots a 'Bucket head' mech, which most other soldiers would be too embarrassed to fly. He also has an attraction to Ririko. *Kaptain-chan: The leader of an organization called JAG G. She has a rather bubbly personality, yet is utterly heartless, due to how she has no qualms against killing children to destroy Dolls. * Katsuki Usumi An unpopular boy at Kirio's school. In the beginning of the first manga its stated that he can't fit in because he can't get used to his situation. Near the end of the second manga, he informs the Black Hares and G-Jag about the other pilots. =Dolls= The robots, or dolls, are part of the Universal Child Welfare Organization, whose goal seems to be to protect children worthy of protection by their standards. They also seem to aim to dispose of the \\"trash among the children\\" as well. The organization is made up of 130 dolls, though they refer to themselves as the \\"130 Sisters Welfare Machines\\", indicating that they were made to destroy and protect. These \\"sisters\\" were governed by the Council of Nine Sisters, composed of the eldest nine sisters. This council was governed by the Waste Removal Bureau, which is possibly a part of the Black Hare Organization. It seems, however, that the 130 Sisters opposed the last mission given to them by the Bureau, which ordered them to obey their commands and \\"purify\\" the \\"illegal star system\\" (our solar system) of \\"illegal life-forms\\" (the aliens that attacked the 13 Wards). Afterwards, while chaos broke apart the 130 Sisters, Q-Ko took on her ground mission (no details were given about the ground mission except it was considered treason by the Council of Nine Sisters) and ended up losing her memory in the process. The sisters once again re-united and many acquired new pilots, but only a few of the dolls' names are given. * Q-Ko: The second protagonist in the series. Q-ko is a cute, shy, and naive robot whose memory was lost while taking on an un-detailed mission. She ends up with Kirio as her pilot, although it seems as if that is so only because she did not make contact with Furiko first. In many ways, she is just like a human; she eats (though she does not chew), she gets hungry, and apparently can feel love and compassion for real humans, like Kirio. In battle, she utilizes a small shield in the shape of a heart and can slice enemies apart with a single laser sword that extends from the fingers of her right hand. Q-ko has large bunny-ear-like panels that are the same color as her hair, they float in place through means unknown. They appear to act similar to wings, streamlining her movements while flying for added speed. She is or was a member of the Council of Nine Sisters and is the ninth oldest of all the 130 Sisters. Q.KO's personality is similar to Canti from FLCL (also by Ueda) seeing as they are both powerful, but seem to have lost their ability to fight well after they broke. They are also both easily embarrassed. *AA-Ko: Possibly the antagonist of the series. AA-ko is cool and collected, yet harbors a cold and bitter hate towards her \\"mother\\", whose identity is never revealed in the story. She also does not like Q-Ko, but they treat one another with respect as they are the only ones who remain out of the 9 Eldest Sisters. Furiko becomes her pilot and also seems to be a hindrance for AA-Ko. She almost never loses her composure, even in the midst of battle. When in her robot form, she utilizes two diamond-shaped shields and her hair as weapons. She uses her hair as weapons by extending it into needles that reach an incredible length. AA-Ko resembles a Japanese ghost to a degree, in that she has long black hair that she can use as a weapon, wears a white kimono, holds her arms in front of her, has invisible feet, and can apparently levitate. She has two diamond-shaped white panels (resembling rabbit ears to a degree) floating above her head through unknown means. Without her kimono (in a scene where she bathes, as example), she appears to be an ordinary Asian teenage girl, with the exception of a visible glowing heart and two floating diamond- shaped panels above her head, which resemble rabbit ears. Compared to the other dolls, her design is unique. She is said to be the strongest of the 130 Sisters. *SS-Ko: SS-Ko is a strict doll wearing a wide brimmed hat, a cape ( like the others.) and rain coat-like dress. She is calm but strict, and will follow rules and orders to the end. She knows a great deal of information concerning Q-Ko and viewed her as a role model before she lost her memory. She is also very mean to Q-Ko and often scolds her. She also describes the love that Q-Ko feels towards Kirio to be a malfunction in her programming, yet is fully aware of the truth behind the situation. She is not very fond of Kirio, possibly due to his misuse of Q-Ko's abilities. She does, however, help Kirio find Q-Ko after she runs away from him and even loses her cool composure when he is frustrated by her riddle. Like Noru, her pilot, SS-Ko seems to know a great deal about the events going on in the story and acts as the mediator between AA-Ko and the other 130 Sisters. In battle, SS-Ko can utilize two laser swords identical to Q-Ko's and also seems to be able to fly faster than her. The flower-like adornment atop her hat acts as a signal beam, but it apparently only works when in her robotic form. She also bears some resemblance to the giant robot from FLCL. *VV-Ko: VV-Ko is the only black series doll mentioned by name in the series. She has also been referred to as \\"Gothlolita\\", which connotes her style, with black Victorian-era \\"gothic\\" clothing and spiral locks of hair. She is first piloted by a photographer nicknamed \\"Otayama\\". She has an attack that causes a huge explosion, at the cost of the life of her pilot, so Otayama was apparently disposable to her. After adopting Shiino Ino as a pilot, VV-Ko shows a more compassionate side, though she still appears to be mute (she also ate the chocolate Shiino bought for her, which is unusual because, as noted by one of the other dolls, Black Series dolls typically only eat living flesh). In her robot form, the ribbon tied behind her outfit resembles bat wings, but she can undo them to use as a single black ribbon, which she spins into a spiral spear, from which she can unleash an explosion. *RK-Ko: RK-Ko is designed to look like a Native American Indian, and is piloted by Mei. Generally quiet and objective, RK-Ko is quick to nullify SS-Ko's critiques of Q-Ko by pointing out that Q-Ko is damaged, and therefore not entirely responsible for her actions. Despite this, RK-Ko still looks to SS-Ko to lead, and shows particular concern for her pilot's welfare. RK-Ko's weapon is a diamond-shaped tomahawk. *NH-Ko: NH-Ko is designed to resemble a girl wearing Italian Tyrolean clothing, with her hat and dress (when in robot mode), she doesn't say a lot but her lines seems to indicate that she cares a lot about her pilot, she can also be quite the hothead, and has a strong disliking of the black-series... *One armed doll: She is never referred to by name, but fans refer to her as X-Ko (as in her X shaped symbols on some places). She never utters a line, but she seems to be a victim of a failed friendship with a doll, because in the first scene of part. Another doll is killed by human forces, and X-Ko obliterates them by forcing a pilot inside her and uses him as ammunition for her attack (similarly to VV-Ko). Before that she reaches out her only hand towards the dying doll. Later on, she just makes brief appearances, among others in a flashback: where she is seen sitting behind the past Q-Ko in similar garb to the past Q-Ko (a ragged poncho). It is also seen that she lacks an eye, and wears a large white eye patch with an X on it, as well as white pieces of paper that hangs down the sides of her head (also with X's). Though in her doll for she wears a white head band. She also lacks a left arm, as seen in the first scene of part 2. Near the end, she dons a long black, hooded robe, giving her the appearance of a grim reaper. In the last scene, she flies along with the other 130 dolls, to their leader AA-Ko. She also appears in a short comic Ueda did for Faust, though very little in known about it.

He was from Kuaiji Commandery, which is around present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Life Sheng Xian served as the administrator of Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu). He recommended Gao Dai () for government service. Around 193, when Xu Gong took over Wu Commandery by force, Gao Dai took Sheng Xian and hid him at the home of a military officer, Xu Zhao (). To dissuade Xu Gong from persecuting Sheng Xian, Gao Dai went to Xu Province to seek help from the provincial governor, Tao Qian. After Tao Qian showed nominal support for their cause, Xu Gong did not pursue them any further. When Sun Ce was conquering the commanderies in the Jiangdong region later in 199, Cheng Pu suggested attacking Xu Zhao, but Sun Ce, citing Xu Zhao's giving sanctuary to Sheng Xian and Yan Baihu as indication of Xu Zhao's faithfulness, did not do so. Nonetheless, Sun Ce saw Sheng Xian's reputation as a threat to his own authority, and Sheng Xian's life was in jeopardy. Around 202, Sheng Xian's close friend Kong Rong persuaded Cao Cao to give Sheng Xian an official appointment as protection. Cao Cao thus appointed Sheng Xian as a Cavalry Commandant (), but he was killed by Sun Ce's successor, Sun Quan, before the commission reached him. Two of Sheng Xian's followers, Dai Yuan () and Gui Lan (), took revenge against Sun Quan by killing his brother Sun Yi and another relative Sun He (). They planned to defect to Cao Cao through Liu Fu. However, Sun Yi's widow devised a plan to trap them and had them killed to avenge her husband. Sheng Xian was survived by a son, Sheng Kuang (), who served under Cao Cao as a military officer. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * . * Sima, Guang (1084).

During his reign, Cao Rui liked to pick on people's wrongdoings, and many people who committed minor offences were executed by him. Qin Lang never advised Cao Rui against his ways, nor did he recommend any talents to the Wei imperial court, but he was still nonetheless deeply favoured by the emperor, who often consulted him and called him by his childhood name \\"Ah-su\\" (ÈòøÁ©å). Cao Rui also showered gifts on Qin Lang and even had a large residence constructed in the capital Luoyang for the latter. Other officials were aware that Qin Lang was not much of a capable and talented person, but they knew that he was close to the emperor Cao Rui, so they often bribed him and attempted to curry favour with him. In return, Qin Lang used his status and close relationship with Cao Rui to help these officials get promotions and even titles of nobility.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÊúóÊ∏∏ÈÅ®Ë´∏‰æØÈñìÔºåÊ≠∑Ê≠¶„ÄÅÊñá‰πã‰∏ñËÄåÁÑ°Â∞§‰πü„ÄÇÂèäÊòéÂ∏ùÂç≥‰ΩçÔºåÊéà‰ª•ÂÖßÂÆòÔºåÁÇ∫È©çÈ®éÂ∞áËªç„ÄÅÁµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠ÔºåÊØèËªäÈßïÂá∫ÂÖ•ÔºåÊúóÂ∏∏Èö®Âæû„ÄÇÊôÇÊòéÂ∏ùÂñúÁôºËàâÔºåÊï∏Êúâ‰ª•ËºïÂæÆËÄåËá¥Â§ßËæüËÄÖÔºåÊúóÁµÇ‰∏çËÉΩÊúâÊâÄË´´Ê≠¢ÔºåÂèàÊú™ÁîûÈÄ≤‰∏ÄÂñÑ‰∫∫ÔºåÂ∏ù‰∫¶‰ª•ÊòØË¶™ÊÑõÔºõÊØèÈ°ßÂïè‰πãÔºåÂ§öÂëºÂÖ∂Â∞èÂ≠óÈòøÁ©åÔºåÊï∏Âä†Ë≥ûË≥úÔºåÁÇ∫Ëµ∑Â§ßÁ¨¨Êñº‰∫¨Âüé‰∏≠„ÄÇÂõõÊñπÈõñÁü•ÊúóÁÑ°ËÉΩÁÇ∫ÁõäÔºåÁå∂‰ª•ÈôÑËøëËá≥Â∞äÔºåÂ§öË≥ÇÈÅ∫‰πãÔºåÂØåÂùáÂÖ¨‰æØ„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 3.

An edited version of the song was issued as a single in the United States on Apple Records, on 28 December 1970. The single edit runs 1:41 shorter than the album due to removing the tolling bells that start the song and a quicker fade-out. The B-side features \\"Why\\" by Yoko Ono. The song peaked in the United States at number 19 on the Cashbox Top 100 and number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. Conception The lyrics of \\"Mother\\" address both of Lennon's parents, each of whom abandoned him in his childhood. His father, Alf, left the family when John was an infant. His mother, Julia, did not live with her son, although they had a good relationship; she was hit and killed in a car accident on 15 July 1958 by an off-duty policeman named Eric Clague, when Lennon was 17. In one of his last concerts, Lennon stated that the song was not just about his parents, but was rather \\"about 99% of the parents, alive or half dead\\". \\"Mother\\" opens the album, starting with a funeral bell tolling slowly, four times. The song ends with Lennon repeating the phrase \\"Mama don't go, daddy come home\\", each time increasing in intensity until he screams the line as the song fades out. Lennon was inspired to write the song after undergoing primal therapy with Arthur Janov, originally at his home at Tittenhurst Park and then at the Primal Institute, California, where he remained for four months. Lennon, who eventually derided Janov, initially described the therapy as \\"something more important to me than The Beatles\\". Although Lennon said that \\"Mother\\" was the song that \\"seemed to catch in my head,\\" he had doubts about its commercial appeal and he considered issuing \\"Love\\" as a single instead. In November 1982, a remixed version of \\"Love\\" was released as a single to help promote The John Lennon Collection LP. An early version of \\"Mother\\" performed on an electric guitar by Lennon can be heard on the John Lennon Anthology box set. A demo version of the song was featured in the final scene and credits of the 2009 John Lennon biographical film, Nowhere Boy. Other versions Barbra Streisand recorded \\"Mother\\" (as well as Lennon's \\"Love\\") on her 1971 album Barbra Joan Streisand; it was also released as a single. The song also featured on Lennon's live album Live in New York City, released by Lennon's widow Yoko Ono after his death. Other songs born out of this period of therapy include \\"Working Class Hero\\" and \\"Isolation\\". Shigesato Itoi, creator of the Mother video game series, stated in an interview that this song was in large part the inspiration for his naming of the series. Mia Martini recorded in 1972 this song in Italian, with the title literally translated as \\"Madre\\". Maynard Ferguson recorded the song on his 1972 album M.F. Horn Two. South African artist Ratau Mike Makhalemele covered the song on an EP of Lennon covers in 1990. Shelby Lynne covered this song on her 2001 album Love, Shelby. Christina Aguilera covered the song in 2007 for the benefit album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. Eminem sampled the song for his song \\"Headlights\\", featured on the album the Marshall Mathers LP 2. Folk artist, Jackie Oates, included a version of the song on her album The Joy of Living in 2018. Lou Reed covered the song several times live featuring electric guitars and violins Personnel The musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows: *John Lennon ‚Äì double-tracked vocals, guitars, piano *Yoko Ono - wind *Ringo Starr ‚Äì drums *Klaus Voormann ‚Äì bass guitar Lennon plays guitar rather than piano on the Nowhere Boy demo version.

He published nearly 400 articles on topics such as genetics, evolution, sociology, geography, and anthropology. Early life and education Cook was born in Clyde, New York in 1867, the son of Orator Fuller and Eliza (n√©e Hookway) Cook. His father was a stonemason from England who had immigrated in 1855. Orator Jr. grew up in Clyde, taught biology for two years before entering university, and graduated from Syracuse University with a B.A. in 1890. He subsequently worked as a biology instructor there the following year. Career In 1891 Cook became a special agent of the New York State Colonization Society. He worked in Liberia, and in 1896, he was elected president of Liberia College. He held that position until 1898. That year he joined the United States Department of Agriculture as a plant scientist, and eventually became Principal Botanist and traveled throughout the world investigating crop species for the United States government. He specialized in cotton and rubber plants and the classification of palms, particularly the palms of Hispaniola. He published almost four hundred books and articles during his career, and was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science by Syracuse University in 1930. Cook served as Honorary Assistant Curator of Cryptogamic Collections at the United States National Herbarium from 1898 until 1948. Cook also studied myriapods (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), describing over 100 species and producing over 50 publications. In 1922, Cook and his colleague Harold Loomis described a species of millipede with more legs than any other organism on Earth: Illacme plenipes which possesses as many as 750 legs. Cook was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Genetic Association, Botanical Society of America, Association of American Geographers, Washington Academy of Sciences, as well as the Cosmos Club, a private social club of Washington D.C. Family In 1892 Cook married the botanist Alice Carter, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. His son Robert Carter Cook became a geneticist.  References  * Guide to the Orator F.

She got the job by directly asking NBC programming director Charles Engel. Feature film production career While working at Motown, Donner became a personal friend of National Lampoon writer John Hughes, and convinced him to write a script that would become her feature film producing debut, the 1983 comedy hit Mr. Mom, starring Michael Keaton. The following year she persuaded Richard Donner to direct Ladyhawke, and the two fell in love, marrying a year after the film was released, 1985. She produced only two more of her husband's movies, Radio Flyer (1992), and Timeline (2003). She said their professional relationship helped her learn how to work on action films: \\"if I hadn't seen how he did action movies, I wouldn't have had the wherewithal to even pursue an X-Men or a Constantine, or any of those\\".Longwell, Todd. Icons: The Donners. The Hollywood Reporter; October 15, 2008 Her experience with Schumacher and Hughes led them to invite her to produce St. Elmo's Fire (1985) and Pretty in Pink (1986), both seminal films of the Brat Pack period. Donner had a particularly successful year in 1993 overseeing two solid hits: Dave, a homespun political comedy, and Free Willy, a family film about a boy and his whale. While Donner has credits in all X-Men films, the last ones she actually produced were X-Men: Days of Future Past and Deadpool; Simon Kinberg took over the later films so Donner could instead make the TV show Legion,Lauren Shuler Donner Confirms Fox Marvel Movies on Hold; Wants ‚ÄòX-Men‚Äô Franchise to ‚ÄúEvolve‚Äù, Collider with Donner only receiving producer credit out of loyalty.

He was also a championship boxer and an amateur pilot. Van Scoy was born March 22, 1920, in Bear Creek, Pennsylvania. His mother died when he was 8 years old. In the 1930s his father a, former steelworker, had a difficult time finding work during the Great Depression. Young Van Scoy graduated from Coughlin High School and made money as a newspaper boy and as a shoeshiner. Van Scoy was a Golden Gloves boxer. In 1942 he joined the Army, where the flip of a coin ignited a new interest. \\"While I was in the army, I went to San Antonio. I with two other officers and we flipped a coin to see who would pay for the movie. I lost and the coin landed on the crystal of my watch and broke it.\\" He took the watch to a repair shop, and when the jeweler learned he was interested in the inner workings of the timepiece, the jeweler taught Van Scoy how to fix a watch. After returning home from the military in 1945, he rented a second floor retail space in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and opened his first jewelry store. Several years later he decided he could make more money selling diamonds exclusively. He often said - I sell the same or better diamond for less!

Lyallpuri played a key role in the development of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and in the Sikh Reform Movement of the early 1920s. Family history and early life Sunder Singh was born in 1878 into a farmers' family of village Bohoru in Amritsar. His father's name was Lakhmir Singh Sandha and mother's was Ram Kaur. During colonisation of Bars, Sandha family along with many others moved to Sheikhupura District (now in Pakistan) where they were allotted lands in the new Bar Chenab colony currently known as Faisalabad. In memoriam of their ancestral village in Amritsar, the colonists named their new settlement in Sheikhupura also as Bohoru (Chak No 18 Bohoru). Sunder Singh was married in 1901 to Bibi Sant Kaur, daughter of S. Mangal Singh of Nizampur. Education and early activities Sunder Singh Lyallpuri had received his basic education in Shahkot (Pakistan) and then obtained B.A. (Honours) from Khalsa College Amritsar and B.T. from Government College Lahore. Lyallpuri was invited for personal interview for the position of tehsildar (revenue officer) but he sat in chair in front of Commissioner without his permission. This caused a verbal scuffle between him and the English officer so that he was sent back without being interviewed. On pressure from his relatives, he later took a position in Indian postal services but here too he was entangled with his English boss. The senior officer called him into his office for inquiry and did not offer him a chair to sit on which again hurt the pride of Sunder Singh. Lyallpuri concluded that his self-respect would not allow him to serve the British Indian government. Khalsa Youngman Association Chenab colony of Lyallpur was a new colonial settlement and so was Lyallpur itself. Sunder Singh made Lyallpur his land of action and henceforth was nicknamed as Lyallpuri. It was a time when the Hindu Arya Samaj movement was ruling supreme in Punjab and the Sikh masses were coming to its fold in large numbers. To counter this phenomenon, Sunder Singh Lyallpuri started educating the Sikh masses about Sikhism and its history. In association with S. Harchand Singh Ryees and some other well-wishers, Lyallpuri founded the Khalsa Bhujangi Sabha (Khalsa Youngman Association), the members of which played a leading role in the Sikh affairs and for the country as a whole. It was this association which had started the Gurdwara Rikabganj Morcha which was later supported by broad Sikh community and won the victory for the Akalis. Sacha Dhandora and Anand Marriage Act At that time, there was extreme illiteracy and ignorance in the Sikh community. Lyallpuri realised the urgent need to awaken and educate the community. He therefore started a weekly newspaper Sacha Dhandora and started publishing patriotic songs and Sikh-ideology related nationalistic articles.According to the report from the Assistant Director of Criminal Intelligence, dated 11 August 1911, it \\"printed largely echoes of the violently nationalistic writings which were then appearing in the Punjab Press and which culminated in a series of press persecutions during 1909-10\\". Sacha Dhandora too fell a victim to prosecution and suppression----Encyclopedia of Sikhism, p 280, Harbans Singh. In those days, Tika Sahib (Wali Ahid) Ripudaman Singh of erstwhile Nabha State was making outstanding contributions towards Sikhism and his views on Sikhism were routinely published in Sacha Dhandora. This had brought Master Lyallpuri and Tika Sahib together. Tika Sahib was also a member of the Imperial Council from 1906 to 1908. Together they worked on the draft for Anand Marriage Act which was later submitted to the Special Committee for review. Since Tika Sahib ceased to be member of the Council after 1908, and in the meanwhile, Sardar Sunder Singh Majithia had become a member of the Imperial Council in his place, therefore, Majithia continued to pursue the matter and the Bill got finally enacted on 22 October 1909.Akali Lehir da Sanchalak, Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri, pp 20-22 The Sikh marriage called Anand Karaj was introduced from the time of the Sikh Gurus but it got statutory recognition only after the passage of the Anand Marriage Act 1909. According to the centrally approved Sikh Code (Sikh Reht Maryada), persons not professing the Sikh faith cannot be joined in wedlock by the Anand Karaj ceremony. Morcha for Rakabganj Wall Along with S Harchand Singh, Teja Singh Samundri, S. Sardul Singh and master Mota Singh, Master Lyallpuri played a crucial role in the Rakabganj Gurudwara Morcha through The Akali (Punjabi Daily) and compelled the Government to yield. The write-ups in The Akali published by Lyallpuri played a very important and effective role in electrifying the Sikh community and rousing it into action for Gurdwara Rakabganj Morcha. Educationist Sardar Harchand Singh was a good friend of Lyallpuri. Both realised the need for education among the Sikh community. So they opened first primary school in the building of Singh Sabha Lyallpura which soon was converted to Lyallpur High School. This noble action also brought several important people like Teja Singh Samundri, Master Tara Singh, S. Harchand Singh, Master Sunder Singh and Prof Niranjan Singh and Jathedar Buta Singh together who had played important roles in Sikh history. Slowly, the High School became the well-known Lyallpur Khalsa College. Other schools founded by Master Lyallpuri or which he helped in founding were: High School Chak No 41 Jhang Branch Khalsa High School Sangla Hill Sheikhupura, Khalsa High School Nwana Pind (Sheikhupura), Khalsa High School Kutia Baba Chetan Das (Sheikhupura), Khalsa High School Jai Chak (Sheikhupura), Kaumi High Schoolh Jhelum, Kaumi College Jhelum etc. Sir Sikander Hyat, the Prime Minister of undivided Punjab, Giani Kartar Singh, Mangal Singh Gill, Gopal Singh Kaumi, Sir Joginder Singh, Qazi Abdul Rehman etc., are some of the well known students of Master Lyallpuri. Some of the Kamboj and other Singhs who fell as martyrs in Saka Nankana had been students of Lyallpuri. In several of the schools he had founded and served, he offered his services free in exchange for only two meals and a pair of personal clothes.Merian Kujh Itihaasak Yaddan, p 124-25, Hira Singh Darad. Martial Law 1919 In view of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 13 April 1919, almost entire Punjab was placed under martial law including Lyallpur. There were no untoward incidents except destruction of telephone and telegraph wires near Lyallpur Railway Station. But a huge mass of dry husk near the station caught fire and as a result 2-3 people burnt alive. It was a coincidence that Lyallpuri was on the station at the moment. Early morning on 22 April, English police fully loaded with machine-guns laid siege to LyallpurPunjab Disturbances, 1919-20, Vol I, Indian Perspective, p 149. and arrested 12 people including Lyallpuri.This included Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri, Sant Singh Lawyer, Dr Dina Nath, Bodh Chand Lawyer, Bhagat Ram Lawyer, Dr Basant Ram, Amir Chand, Sita Ram Dala, Bhagat Singh Ditchkotia, Bajaj Harnam Singh, Hakim Nishan Singh and Hakim Nurdin (See: Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 287, S Kirpal Singh. Lyallpuri was tried for charges of arson, violence and murder. The charge was not proved, but still Lyallpuri was sentenced to death by hanging. Lyallpuri's case was taken up by famous lawyers like Pt. Moti Lal Nehru, C. R. Das and Pt. Madan Mohan Malayia. Later, under special Government proclamation, the death sentence was commuted to fine and imprisonment. But the nationalist lawyers like Malayia continued to pursue the case and finally the sentence was reduced to a fine of Rs 1200 and imprisonment of 1.5 years, for which he was deported to Andebar and Nicobar.See: Baba Visakha Singh (Jiwani) p 24, Dr Jaswant Singh. The fine was paid by Lyallpuri's father by mortgaging/selling his land.Meri Aap Beeti, p 138, (unpublished), Lyallpuri. Founder of The Akali Daily After release from jail, Lyallpuri held a meeting of his friends which included Sardar S. Harchand Singh, S. Sardul Singh Kaveeshar, Giani Hira Singh Darad, S. Mangal Singh Gill (Tehsildar), S. Pratap Singh Gujjaranwala and S. Teja Singh Samundri in the house of S. Sardul Singh Kaveeshar. Based on the decision of the meeting, Master Lyallpuri founded a Punjabi daily which was named The Akali after Baba Akali Phula Singh. Dr Harjinder Singh Dilgeer, SIKH HISTORY IN 10 VOLUMES, volume 4, pp 135-36. The Akali daily was meant to protect the rights of Sikhs and provide a political voice for their interests. The first issue of The Akali appeared on 21 May 1920 with Lyallpuri as its Owner, Manager, Publisher and Chief Editor. He was assisted by Giani Hira Singh Darad and S Mangal Singh Gill etc. It was the first Punjabi daily to be published and in its very first issue, it had outlined in its editorial note its programme advocating: (1) Panthic control over the Gurdwaras; (2) Panthic control of Khalsa College, Amritsar; (3) repairing the demolished wall of Gurudwara Rakabganj, Delhi; (4) creation of religious and political awakening among the Sikh masses and to line them up for more effective roles in India's struggle of independence; and (5) creation of a Sikh organisation and choosing its members democratically through elections based on Panchayat rules.See: Editorial Note by Lyallpuri, The Akali, 21 May 1920. The writings in The Akali were so effective and bold compared to the Urdu dailies of the times that some Hindus and even Muslims had especially learnt Gurmukhi to read The AkaliMerian Kujh Itihaasak Yadan, p 136, Hira Singh Darad The paper effectively and forcefully raised the wall issue of Gurdwara Rakabganj Delhi and roused the Sikh community into dynamic action and participation. A big Shaheedi Jatha was organised but before it reached Delhi, the Government yielded to the demands of the Sikh community. Master Lyallpuri coined the expression Na-Milvartan Lehir, for Asehyog Lehir ('Non-Cooperation Movement') proposed by Mahatma Gandhi which name got the widest acceptance and popularity in Punjab.Merian Kujh Itihaasak Yaadan, p 166, Giani Hira Singh Darad. The coining of the impressive expression like Na- Milvartan and to make it most popular in Punjab could only fall to the share of a daily like The Akali alone. Not only in Punjab, this alternative expression started to be used in whole of India and became an integral part of the vocabulary of the national struggle and history.Teja Singh Samundri, p 64, Dr Piar Singh. Founding of Akali movement After awakening and organising the Sikh community and achieving a first phase of success in the domain of religion and education, The Akali started dedicating its columns to India's freedom struggle. The paper became a unifying and organising instrument for the Akali Tehrik as well as it also became a mouthpiece of the Sikhs. The paper had realistically adopted a nationalistic approach and had also offered a powerful common front against the anti-Indian, anti-communal and pro- imperialist forces. With the untiring efforts of The Akali under Master Lyallpuri, Shiromani Committee (the religious wing) and Shiromani Akali Dal, (the religio-political wing) of the Sikh Community took birth on 15‚Äì16 November 1920 and on 14 December 1920 respectively. \\"The role of 'The Akali' must be regarded as the milestone in 'Akali Movement'. After the name of newspaper (i.e The Akali), the 'Gurudwara Reform Movement' also became popularly known as the 'Akali Movement'\\" .Sankhep Sikh Itihaas, (1469-1962), Dr Piara Singh Padam. Master Sundar Singh Lyallpuri is regarded as the founding father of the 'Akali Movement' and the 'Shiromini Akali Dal' (i.e. the religio-political wing of the Akali party).See: S. Sohan Singh Josh, Akali Morchian Da Itihaas, Delhi, 1977, 23; Shiromani Committee Da Janam te Isde Pradhan, Qaumi Ekta, June 1975, S. Sohan Singh Josh; Akali Lehir da Sanchalak, Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri, S Kirpal Singh; At the national level, the Na Milwartan Lehir (Non-Cooperation Movement) was so effectively projected in the daily The Akali that it caused a great alarm and concern among the English Government and they had to arrest Lyallpuri and later other 10-12 of its editors, one after another, within two years. Security of The Akali was also forfeited. Under section 124 'O', Master Lyallpuri was charged and sentenced to one year imprisonment in 1922 for writing and publishing provocative material. Akali Urdu News paper After release from prison in 1923, Master Lyallpuri started Akali (Urdu) from Amritsar. The daily continued till 1929-30 with minor breaks but after 1930, it was closed due to financial reasons. Hindustan Times Pt Madan Mohan Malayia was a very good friend of Master Lyallpuri. He had suggested to Master Lyallpuri that Akali should start one of their own English newspaper so that the Akal agenda and voice could reach every nook and corner of India. Accordingly, the 'Managing Board' of The Akali newspaper held a meeting under chairmanship of Lyallpuri and decided to found an English daily. The Board assigned the task to Master Lyallpuri and S Mangal Singh Gill. However, the move received a setback when Lyallpuri was arrested under section 124 'O' for writing what the English Government thought was objectionable material in The Akali. On release from jail, Lyallpuri resumed the efforts and put an advertisement in The Akali asking for donations for five Lakhs from Sikh Sangat. In response, the Punjabi fans of Master Lyallpuri from Stockton (USA) immediately wired Rs 150,000. Another Rs 70,000 was contributed by local Sikh community with the efforts of Lyallpuri. S Mangal Singh Gill and Chanchal Singh (Jandiala, Jullundur) were made in charge of the newspaper. Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya and Master Tara Singh were members of the Managing Committee. K. S. Panikar was its first Editor. Devdas Gandhi was also on the editor's panel. The Managing chairman and Chief Patron was Master Lyallpuri himself. The opening ceremony was performed by Mahatma Gandhi on 15 September 1924. The first issue was published from Naya Bazar, Delhi (Now: Swami Sharda Nand Marag). It was very unfortunate for the Sikhs that due to lack of experience, and jealousy and betrayal of the fellows like Master Tara Singh and S. Mangal Singh Gill, as well as due to lack of viable financial resources, the Hindustan Times soon came into severe grip of financial crisis so that its ownership had to be sold to Pt Madan Mohan Malayia. Even Pt Malayia could not keep it running for long and he sold it to G. D. Birla.M. D. Vazirudin, Witness to an Era, (Article), The Tribune, 12 September 1982 The sale of the ownership of the Hindustan Times had caused a great mental anguish to Lyallpuri. Master Lylallpuri has personally written that: \\"S. Mangal Singh and Co. torpedoed my aim of nationalism and of Hindu-Sikh-Muslim-Christian unity. They rather gave it a communal twist, so the Akalis had to part company with Hindustan Times; and this also caused winding up of the Sikh Center at Delhi which I had established with so much fondness and hard labour.\\"Meri Aap Beeti, (unpublished), pp 91-94, Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri. Hindustan Times which was founded by Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri and friends and later sold out by Akalis now forms one of the most leading groups of Indian dailies and is published from several places, besides Delhi. Other weekly newspapers Besides the dailies like The Akali and Hindustan Times, Master Lyallpuri had started several weeklies also. The important in the list are: Akali, Azad Akal (Punjabi), Azad Akali (Urdu), Melu, Nawa Yug, Daler Khalsa, Kundan, Inkalab (Urdu), Sanjhiwal, and Guru Khalsa. Each of them ran for a while and then ceased due to political or financial or both reasons.  National leadership In the wake of Hindu-Muslim riots of 1924, Mahatma Gandhi and other national leaders like Maulana Mohammad Ali and Dr M. A. Anusari called a national Ekta Samelan at Delhi in 1924 which continued for several days. It concentrated mainly on national unity, mutual trust, love and brotherhood. At the end a Central National Panchayat was constituted which was authorised to recruit further members and expand it to the grass roots. With Mahatma Gandhi as its chairman and Convener, the National Panchayat included, among others, Lala Lajpat Rai, G. K. Nariman, Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri, Dr S. K. Datta and Hakim Ajmal Khan.Autobiography, 1957, p 4, Dr Rajendra Prasad, First President of India In the following years, Master Lyallpuri organised or else participated in several seminars or Ekta Samelans for the promotion of mutual love, trust and brotherhood among the Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and the Sikhs.The Akali te Pradesi, 11 October 1924, p 4 Lyallpuri also remained a member of All India Congress Committee.Amritsar De Jhujhar Yodhe, 1984, p 188-189, Ram Singh Majitha. Lyallpuri had also attended the Lahore Congress Session of 1929. At the proposal of Baba Kharak Singh and Lyallpuri, a resolution was included in the Congress Session asking for Complete Independence of India. Master Lyallpuri was also involved in the preparation of its wording. Some of the conservative Congress members however, had opposed this resolution but it still got passed with majority vote. Another resolution pressed forward by these Akalis was to ensure fair and equitable treatment to the minorities. Lyallpuri had also participated in Civil Disobedience Movement and underwent three years' imprisonment.Amritsar De Jhujhar Yodhe, 1984, p 189, Ram Singh Majitha Legacy and death Lyallpuri had lost all of his 1.5 murabba fertile land, a house and other property. When S. Paratap Singh Kairon became Chief Minister of Punjab, he allotted him of land and a sustenance pension of Rs 100 per month. Baba Gurdit Singh, the hero of the Komagata Maru incident used to address Lyallpuri as Baba Phula Singh Akali and also called him Pita ji (dear father). S. Pratap Singh Kairon addressed him as Chacha Ji and used such a vocabulary for him which put him at par with our Gurus. Lyallpuri died on 3 March 1969.

They met at the audition, which subsequently led to their friendship.Making the Band/The Rise and Fall of Danity Kane, MTV (2009-04-30). Retrieved on 30 April 2009. At the final audition, not only was Fimbres successful but she was the first contestant to make it into the house. Fimbres was one of the \\"standouts\\" during the competition. She excelled in dancing and her vocals set her apart from the other contestants. She experienced significant personal struggles while competing, which helped to further endear her to the audience. Their \\"den mother\\" Jason was viewed as rude to the women in the house. In one episode, Jason criticized Fimbres for not having a well- toned abdomen. Despite this, Fimbres continued to display good vocal and dance performances. During the first-season finale of Making the Band 3, Sean Combs decided against forming a group, but chose Fimbres as one of the contestants from the first season, along with O'Day, to participate in the second season. During the second season, Fimbres' dance performance declined. Her vocals remained favorable to judges and fellow contestants, but her dancing ability was in question. Fimbres later improved the quality of her dancing. On the season finale of the series, she was picked to be in the group, which soon became known as Danity Kane. = 2005-09: Danity Kane = Danity Kane's first studio album, Danity Kane was released in 2006 and achieved success in the United States, shipping a million copies domestically,. Two singles from the album were top 10 hits, \\"Show Stopper\\", and the ballad, \\"Ride for You\\". Their second studio album, Welcome to the Dollhouse, was released on March 18, 2008, following the release of their second top 10 hit single \\"Damaged\\". The band became the first female group in Billboard history to have their first two albums open at the top of the charts. The season finale of Making the Band October 14, 2008, confirmed the departure of O'Day and D. Woods. With bandmate Shannon Bex deciding not to continue within the group and declining to return to film the show's 2009 season, Fimbres and Dawn Richard were the only two returning members for the group and the series. The group's break up was confirmed in January 2009. However, they were shown on air as being completely over in April 2009, where Fimbres was \\"officially\\" released from her Bad Boy Records contract by Combs in the April 16, 2009, episode of the series.Making the Band, MTV (2009-04-16). Retrieved on 16 April 2009. Fimbres had initially formed a strong connection with O'Day while competing to be in the band. The two made it through two seasons together, and gained a large and loyal fanbase before Combs chose them to be in the group. Viewers named the two \\"the AUs\\" and \\"Aubrea\\" (portmanteux of their first names put together), and O'Day declared Fimbres her best friend in the season 2 finale of the series. Fimbres' friendship with O'Day, however, later became distant, which has been suggested as one of the reasons for Danity Kane's demise.Making the Band, MTV (2008-10-07).

A graduate of Amherst College, he began to teach himself to cook frugally while living briefly in New York City's Lower East Side, where he sought to become a writer of some sort as a young man during the 1960s. By the early 1970s, he was a teacher for several years at Stockbridge School, a progressive New England boarding school that became defunct in 1976. Following this period, Thorne lived in Boston for a number of years, where he self-published a number of culinary pamphlets reviewed at the time by The New York Times, which in 1983 grew into his ongoing newsletter, \\"Simple Cooking\\". In the middle 1980s, Thorne moved to coastal Maine to devote himself exclusively to food writing, and where he became associated with Matt Lewis, who later shared a byline for a number of his books and his newsletter. During the 1990s, the couple moved to Northampton, Mass., where they remained as of 2010. Thorne's newsletter has consisted of essays on food preparation and appreciation blended with snatches of autobiography. It also has often included commentary from fictional characters from the fantasy \\"No Name Diner,\\" as well as frequent cookbook reviews, and much more rarely, opposing essays by various pseudonymous authors, who are apparently Thorne. Based upon the newsletter's success, Thorne authored at least six books issued by major publishers as of 2009. Publishers Weekly, reviewing Outlaw Cook, said his \\"essays delight with passion and originality\\". The content of much of these works had previously appeared in the self-published newsletters. Thorne has been named the best American food writer by both Gourmet and Connoisseur magazines and other sources. Saveur magazine named him to their 2009 Saveur 100 list, calling him \\"the poet of the every day\\", and his work was for many years frequently quoted in various national newspapers and other publications .

Early alternative religious period (1890-1895) Arthur Worthington's documented life began when he settled in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1890, after emigration from the United States. He began to lecture at a local Oddfellows Hall on subjects such as metaphysics, natural philosophy and the human mind, and rapidly gained a following. Worthington's externally professed sexual ethics were conservative, and he preached celibacy and the value of the institution of marriage. He established an alternative religious faith called the Temple of Truth. Worthington and bigamy Reverend John Hosking, a fundamentalist minister at St Asaphs Free Methodist Church investigated Worthington's background, and found that Worthington had contracted at least five bigamous marriages - to Miss Josephine Moore (New York, 1868), Miss Groot (Albany, New York), Mrs Lizzie Cowell (Troy, Michigan), Miss Joy Winfield (Chicago, Illinois) and May Barlow (Xenia, Ohio). He had eloped with already-married Mary Plunkett to Christchurch, and had several pseudonyms employed in the previous recorded instances. After the exposure of his past, Hosking eloped with Miss Evelyn Jordan, a follower at the Temple of Truth, leaving Mrs Plunkett to deal with the adverse publicity and debts that Reverend Hosking's matrimonial and financial fraud had generated in Christchurch. Worthington in Australia (1897-1904) Worthington fled to Australia, where he settled in Tasmania (1895‚Äì1897). Unfortunately, he found that its rural and mining frontier society held little promise for an alternative religious entrepreneur, and returned to Christchurch in 1897, only to find that his estranged ex-lover had revealed all of the details of their relationship, and that the former Temple of Truth had closed down. He attempted to revive it, but faced a riot from Reverend Hosking and his own supporters, which was narrowly averted by the police. As a consequence of this hostile reaction, Worthington resettled in Melbourne, Australia. He founded a new Temple of Truth, attracted new followers, and set himself up as a reincarnation of Osiris, the ancient Egyptian deity.1902 'An \\"Apostle\\" Arrested.', Morning Post (Cairns, Qld. : 1897 - 1907), 19 September, p. 3., viewed 23 Jan 2018, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42955219 He was exposed when he tried to defraud a wealthy widow out of her spousal inheritance, and was imprisoned for seven years. After he served his sentence, Worthington returned to the United States, allegedly had an evangelical religious experience and became a Presbyterian Church minister. He was again imprisoned, because of financial fraud, and died in prison in 1917.

On April 10, 2014, the FBI placed him on the list of its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. On June 27, 2018, Bishop, who would be 81, was removed from the list, making room, the FBI said, for a \\"dangerous fugitive.\\" However, he is still being actively pursued by the FBI.  Biography  William Bradford Bishop Jr. was born August 1, 1936, in Pasadena, California to Lobelia and William Bradford Bishop Sr. He attended South Pasadena High School and received a bachelor of science degree in history from Yale University and a master of arts degree in international studies from Middlebury College.https://www.thewashingtondailynews.com/2014/04/11/the-bradford-bishop- mystery/ Alternatively, he has been reported to have a bachelor's degree in American Studies from Yale and a master's degree in Italian from Middlebury College. He also holds a master's degree in African Studies from UCLA. After graduating from Yale in 1959, Bishop married his high school sweetheart Annette Weis, with whom he had three sons. He joined the U.S. Army and spent four years in the counterintelligence area. Bishop also learned to speak four foreign languages fluently: Italian, French, Serbo-Croatian, and Spanish. After leaving the Army, Bishop joined the U.S. State Department and served in the Foreign Service in many postings overseas. This included postings in the Italian cities of Verona, Milan, and Florence (where he did post-graduate work at the University of Florence) from 1968 to 1972. He also served in Africa, including posts in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and in Gaborone, Botswana, from 1972 to 1974. His last posting, which began in 1974, was at State Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. as an assistant chief in the Division of Special Activities and Commercial Treaties. He was living in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife and three sons as well as his mother, Lobelia.  Killings  On March 1, 1976, after learning he would not receive a promotion he had sought, Bishop told his secretary he did not feel well and left his office in Foggy Bottom. Police believe he drove to his bank, where he withdrew several hundred dollars, then to Montgomery Mall, where he bought a sledgehammer and gas can; he also filled the gas can and the tank of his station wagon, at an adjacent gas station. From there he drove to a hardware store, where he purchased a shovel and pitchfork. He returned to his home in Bethesda between 7:30 and 8 p.m. Police believe Bishop's wife was likely killed first, then his mother as she returned from walking the family dog. Finally, his three sons (aged 5, 10, and 14) were killed while they slept in an upstairs bedroom. Bishop allegedly drove the bodies in a station wagon to a densely wooded swamp about south of Columbia, North Carolina, where on March 2, he dug a shallow hole where he piled the bodies and set them ablaze with gasoline. Found with the burned bodies were a gas can, a pitchfork, and a shovel with a label of \\"OCH HDW\\", which was determined to be from Poch's Hardware. Bishop is known to have purchased tennis shoes at a sporting goods store in Jacksonville, North Carolina later that same day. According to witnesses, he had the family dog with him and was possibly accompanied by a woman described as \\"dark skinned\\". On March 10 a neighbor contacted police, after not seeing the family for some time. A detective found blood on the Bishop home's front porch and on the floor and walls of the front hall and bedrooms. Dental records were used to confirm that the bodies found in North Carolina were of Bishop's family. On March 18, Bishop's 1974 Chevy station wagon was found abandoned at an isolated campground in Elkmont, Tennessee at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a few miles from the Appalachian Trail and about from Columbia, North Carolina (where the bodies had been found). The car contained dog biscuits, a bloody blanket, a shotgun, an ax and a shaving kit with Bishop's medication; the trunk's spare-tire well was full of blood. A witness believed the car had been there since about March 5 to 7. Police theorized that Bishop joined the flow of hikers on the Appalachian Trail and attempted to follow his scent with bloodhounds but without success. The following day, a grand jury indicted Bishop on five counts of first degree murder and other charges.  Psychology  = Motives and stressors = Bishop's motives have never been fully explained. A 1977 article in The Washington Post reported that there was \\"no evidence of infidelity, or financial or job problems.\\" Although Bishop had been passed over for a promotion, there was no history of work-related issues; his being passed over has been described as \\"the first glitch in the storybook tale\\". It has been reported that Bishop's career had caused some marital tension. Bishop was unhappy at his desk job and interested in another foreign posting, but his wife Annette was reluctant. She had begun to study art at the University of Maryland despite Bishop's desire for her to remain a stay-at-home mom. Most sources agree that the Bishops were experiencing some financial issues, but there has been disagreement as to their severity. The Washington Post reported in 1986 that the issues were \\"mild\\" and \\"familiar to most upwardly mobile families.\\" John E. Douglas described them as \\"nothing terribly unusual for people in their thirties living in that kind of neighborhood.\\" In 2013, Bethesda Magazine reported that the Internal Revenue Service had been auditing the family's taxes due to financial troubles. The existence of an audit has not been confirmed by the FBI or the IRS. = Profile = Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver in Bishop's case. The FBI states that Bishop is an avid outdoorsman who enjoys camping and hiking; also, that he had a pilot's license from when he was stationed in Africa. He enjoys riding motorcycles and working out every week. He has a history of depression and insomnia, having been afflicted with both conditions and taking Serax (oxazepam) in the time leading up to the murders. He is fond of dogs. He also enjoys scotch, peanuts, and spicy foods. He has a six-inch vertical scar on his lower back from surgery and has a cleft chin and mole on his left face cheek. Bishop may have had his father's Smith & Wesson M&P; .38 Special revolver with the serial number C981967 and his Yale class ring with him when he vanished. He is also believed to have taken his diplomatic passport with him, as the family's diplomatic passports were all found at their home but his was missing.  Possible sightings  Bishop had approximately one week of advance time before the authorities began looking for him. It has been suggested that he could have traveled on his diplomatic passport. The FBI Special Agent in Charge, Steve Vogt, stated in 2014 that neither Bishop's wallet nor passport have ever been found. It has also been speculated that Bishop may have had intelligence training in the 1960s which may have helped him evade detection in 1976. Since 1976, Bishop has allegedly been sighted a number of times in various European countries, including Italy, Belgium, England, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The three most credible sightings noted by the United States Marshals Service are: * In July 1978, a Swedish woman, who said she had collaborated with Bishop while on a business trip in Ethiopia, reported she had spotted him twice in a public park in Stockholm during a span of one week. She stated she was \\"absolutely certain\\" that the man was Bishop. She did not contact the police at the time because she had not yet realized he was wanted for murder in the U.S. * In January 1979, Bishop was reportedly seen by a former U.S. State Department colleague in a restroom in Sorrento, Italy. The colleague greeted the bearded man, whom he personally believed to be Bishop, eye-to-eye, asking the man impulsively, \\"Hey, you're Brad Bishop, aren't you?\\" The man panicked suddenly, responding in a distinctly American accent; \\"Oh no.\\" He then ran swiftly out of the restroom and fled into the Sorrento alleyways. * On September 19, 1994, on a Basel, Switzerland train platform, a neighbor who had known Bishop and his family in Bethesda was on vacation and reported that she had seen Bishop from a few feet away. The neighbor described Bishop as \\"well-groomed\\" and said that he was getting into a car.  Possible current whereabouts and new information  In 2010 authorities believed Bishop was living in Switzerland, Italy or elsewhere in Europe, or possibly in California; he may have worked as a teacher or become involved in criminal activities. In 2010 it was revealed that before the murders Bishop had been corresponding with federal prison inmate Albert Kenneth Bankston in United States Penitentiary, Marion, though it is unknown why or how.Bethesda magazine in 2013 Bishop evidently had instructed Bankston to send letters to his U.S. State Department office address. America's Most Wanted posted the last letter on its web site, which Bankston mailed 16 days after the murders without knowing that they had happened or that Bishop was a fugitive unable to receive mail at his office. Bankston died in 1983 before law enforcement discovered his connection to Bishop in 1993. In 2014, the body of an unidentified man resembling Bishop, who had been killed by a car while walking along an Alabama highway in 1981, was exhumed by the FBI.\\"FBI exhumes body in hunt for '10 Most Wanted' fugitive search\\", by Andrew Russel, Global News. A DNA test indicated the man was not Bishop. In 2011 the FBI used fingerprints to determine that reports that Bishop had died in Hong Kong or France were false. In 2014, authorities stated he was probably living in plain sight in the United States and avoiding discovery by avoiding arrest. Being arrested would enable law enforcement to run his fingerprints and catch him.https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi- searching-for-william-bradford-bishop-2014-4 In 2014, at the request of the FBI, forensic artist Karen Taylor created an age progression sculpture to suggest Bishop's projected appearance at about age 77. Using Taylor's sculpture, several alternative images were created by Lisa Sheppard to show the addition of facial hair and glasses. File:William bradford bishop expressions.pngDifferent angles of age progression sculpture. File:William bradford bishop alternate looks.jpgWhat Bishop might look like with a goatee and glasses.  In the media  After the initial national headlines, the Bishop case was the subject of articles in national publications like Reader's Digest and Time Magazine at milestone anniversaries. It was followed on an ad hoc basis by The Washington Post, the Washington Star, and The Washington Times as well as local Washington D.C. television stations. The case was featured on television shows such as NBC's Unsolved Mysteries, ABC's Vanished and Fox's America's Most Wanted. Bishop was profiled on AMW website 33 years to the day since his family's bodies were discovered, with a new age-enhanced bust of him with facial hair. A German TV show, Aktenzeichen XY ... ungel√∂st, also featured the case in its 250th episode on November 6, 1992, to find possible evidence of Bishop living abroad. Ballet dancer Jacques d'Amboise revealed in his 2011 autobiography that, as a teenager, he had lived with the Bishop family in South Pasadena, California for a while. This situation resulted from Brad's mother Lobelia's love of ballet and d'Amboise's engagement near South Pasadena with a traveling ballet troupe. He remembers Brad Bishop as very intelligent, reticent and intense. They played chess together. D'Amboise remained in regular contact with Bishop's mother Lobelia, via mail and international phone calls, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, though they never met during this time period. D'Amboise met Brad's wife Annette once; it was when Brad and Annette were newlyweds visiting his parents' house in South Pasadena. It was before Annette announced her first pregnancy. In February 1976, when Jacques d'Amboise was scheduled to perform at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Lobelia invited him and his wife Carrie to spend Sunday night, February 29, at the Bishops' home in Bethesda. D'Amboise cancelled his appearance at the last minute due to a foot injury, but failed to notify the family. About a week later, he saw a newspaper report of the five burning bodies in North Carolina; it occurred to him that Lobelia had not contacted him to express concern about his absence. D'Amboise subsequently wondered whether his planned visit on February 29 and March 1 would have prevented the murders or resulted in him and his wife being killed as well. In early April 2014, WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. launched a webpage to display multiple investigative reports and extensive information on the Bishop case. This included samples of Bishop's handwriting, fingerprints, dental records and previously unseen Bishop family videos. On July 27, 2014, the search for Bishop was a featured story on The Hunt with John Walsh on CNN. The titular host of the program has described Bishop as \\"a sociopathic cold blooded narcissistic killer [sic]\\" as well as \\"a horrible coward bully.\\"  See also  * Crime in Maryland * John List, New Jersey man who killed his family at home in 1971 and remained at large under a new identity for 18 years * List of fugitives from justice who disappeared  References  =Citations= =Works cited= *  External links  *Agents, Investigators Search Underground, Across the Country, and Around the World for FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive, FBI *March 2006 The Washington Post Article marking the 30-year anniversary of the Bishop murders *Bradford Bishop's FBI Ten Most Wanted Poster *Bethesda Magazine May-June 2013 article on Bishop *NBC Washington Special Report on Bradford Bishop Category:1936 births Category:1976 murders in the United States Category:American diplomats Category:FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives Category:Fugitives wanted by the United States Category:Fugitives wanted on murder charges Category:Middlebury College alumni Category:People from Bethesda, Maryland Category:People from Pasadena, California Category:Possibly living people Category:United States Army soldiers Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:University of Florence alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Familicides ","title":"Bradford Bishop"},{"id":"5699081","text":"The Federal Road through the territory of the Creek people was a project that started in 1805 when the Creek gave permission for the development of a \\"horse path\\" through their nation for more efficient mail delivery between Washington City (modern-day Washington, D.C.) and New Orleans, Louisiana. This section started at Fort Wilkinson near Milledgeville, Georgia, and ended at Fort Stoddert near Mobile, Alabama.

The Federal Road was at first for mail delivery. It was widened into a war road during 1811, and used during the Creek War (1813-14). The result was removal of most of the Creek people to the West. Another Federal Road (Cherokee lands) went from Savannah, Georgia through northern Georgia to Knoxville, Tennessee, and opened up Cherokee land for settlement.

Survival Under Atomic Attack was the title of an official United States government booklet released by the Executive Office of the President, the National Security Resources Board (document 130), and the Civil Defense Office. Released at the onset of the Cold War era, the pamphlet was in line with rising fears that the Soviet Union would launch a nuclear attack against the United States, and outlined what to do in the event of an atomic attack.Survival under Atomic Attack; Department of Civil Defense; 1951; archive.org  Purpose  Published in 1950 by the Government Printing Office, one year after the Soviet Union detonated their first atomic bomb, the booklet explains how to protect oneself, one's food and water supply, and one's home. It also covered how to prevent burns and what to do if exposed to radiation. Because much of the book is arranged around calculations of the effects of the relatively small fission weapons of the time (ca. 20 kilotons), much of the information could be viewed as out of date in terms of nuclear weapons, however the most numerous nuclear weapons in both the US & USSR/Russian arsenal are and remain approximately 100 kiloton in yield(e.g. W76 and Bulava) due to the flexibility that MIRVs offer. It was also published before studies of the effects of nuclear weapons on civilian areas had taken place. The U.S Strategic bombing survey had assessed the civilian response in Hiroshima and Nagasaki beginning as early as August‚ÄìSeptember 1945 and its report was \\"Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved...\\". Secondly, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission was active from 1946 to 1975 studying the effects of the two bombs on survivors in both cities and thus represented four years of post- bombing study at the time of publication.  Center Insert  Original release of Survival Under Atomic Attack The four pages in the center of the brochure (15, 16, 17, 18) were designed to be torn out. \\"Remove this sheet and keep it with you until you've memorized it.\\" = Kill the Myths (15) = ;Atomic Weapons Will Not Destroy The Earth: Atomic bombs hold more death and destruction than man ever before has wrapped up in a single package, but their over-all power still has very definite limits. Not even hydrogen bombs will blow the earth apart or kill us all by radioactivity. ;Doubling Bomb Power Does Not Double Destruction: Modern A-bombs can cause heavy damage 2 miles away, but doubling their power would extend that range only to 2.5 miles. To stretch the damage range from 2 to 4 miles would require a weapon more than 8 times the rated power of present models. ;Radioactivity Is Not The Bomb's Greatest Threat: In most atom raids, blast and heat are by far the greatest dangers that people must face. Radioactivity alone would account for only a small percentage of all human deaths and injuries, except in underground or underwater explosions. ;Radiation Sickness Is Not Always Fatal: In small amounts, radioactivity seldom is harmful. Even when serious radiation sickness follows a heavy dosage, there is still a good chance for recovery. = Six Survival Secrets For Atomic Attacks (16, 17) =  Always Put First Things First And (16)  ;1. Try To Get Shielded: If you have time, get down in a basement or subway. Should you unexpectedly be caught out-of-doors, seek shelter alongside a building, or jump in any handy ditch or gutter. ;2. Drop Flat On Ground Or Floor: To keep from being tossed about and to lessen the chances of being struck by falling and flying objects, flatten out at the base of a wall, or at the bottom of a bank. ;3. Bury Your Face In Your Arms: When you drop flat, hide your eyes in the crook of your elbow. That will protect your face from flash burns, prevent temporary blindness and keep flying objects out of your eyes.  Never Lose Your Head And (17)  ;4. Don't Rush Outside Right After A Bombing: After an air burst, wait a few minutes then go help to fight fires. After other kinds of bursts wait at least 1 hour to give lingering radiation some chance to die down. ;5. Don't Take Chances With Food Or Water In Open Containers: To prevent radioactive poisoning or disease, select your food and water with care. When there is reason to believe they may be contaminated, stick to canned and bottled things if possible. ;6. Don't Start Rumors: In the confusion that follows a bombing, a single rumor might touch off a panic that could cost your life. = Five Keys To Household Safety (18) = ;1. Strive For \\"Fireproof Housekeeping\\": Don't let trash pile up, and keep waste paper in covered containers. When an alert sounds, do all you can to eliminate sparks by shutting off the oil burner and covering all open flames. ;2. Know Your Own Home: Know which is the safest part of your cellar, learn how to turn off your oil burner and what to do about utilities. ;3. Have Emergency Equipment And Supplies Handy: Always have a good flashlight, a radio, first-aid equipment and a supply of canned goods in the house. ;4. Close All Windows And Doors And Draw The Blinds: If you have time when an alert sounds, close the house up tight in order to keep out fire sparks and radioactive dusts and to lessen the chances of being cut by flying glass. Keep the house closed until all danger is past. ;5. Use the Telephone Only For True Emergencies: Do not use the phone unless absolutely necessary. Leave the lines open for real emergency traffic.

On May 25, 2000, an Airbus A330-301 operating on the route was hijacked by a man later identified as Reginald Chua, just before the airplane was about to land. The flight carried 278 passengers and 13 crew members.  Hijacking  The hijacker had a gun and a hand grenade. He fired a gun into a bulkhead and demanded to be let into the cockpit. When access was refused, he then demanded the passengers place their valuables in a bag before he commanded the pilot to descend and depressurize the aircraft so that he could escape by a homemade parachute. Since it did not have a rip cord, one was made with a curtain sash on the aircraft. Before he was about to jump, he was not able to overcome the gust of wind from the plane's open rear door, and a flight attendant helped him jump out of the plane. The hijacker was wearing a ski mask and swimming goggles when he jumped out of the plane together with the valuables he had stolen while the plane was flying at an altitude of 1,800 meters over Antipolo, Rizal. Officials initially identified him as \\"Augusto Lakandula\\", based on the name on his ticket. The pilot expressed skepticism that the hijacker would have survived the jump. Three days after the hijacking, the hijacker was found dead, his body nearly buried in the mud,https://www.upi.com/Archives/2000/05/26/Body-of-Philippine-hijacker- found/3001959313600/ in the village of Llabac, in Real, Quezon, about southeast of Manila, near the border with Laguna province. Police authorities stated that he died since he was unable to get his parachute to open. Through his driver's license, \\"Lakandula\\" was finally correctly identified as Reginald Chua, who had reportedly suffered financial difficulties.https://www.upi.com/Archives/2000/05/26/Body-of-Philippine- hijacker-found/3001959313600/ In popular culture The incident is referenced in the 2013 British film Metro Manila. The film's protagonist Oscar Ramirez (Jake Macapagal) tells the story of Alfred Santos, a textile factory owner who lost his father to a gang hired by a rival factory. Having forced to shut down his business due to continuous threats by his rival, Santos hijacked an airliner and ordered the passengers to surrender their money and valuables before jumping off the plane to his death.

Associated plant species include papala kepau (Pisonia umbellifera), ƒÅwikiwiki (Canavalia galeata), ilima (Sida fallax), ≈çlulu (Brighamia insignis), alahee (Psydrax odorata), k≈çpiko (Psychotria spp.), olopua (Nestegis sandwicensis), ahakea (Bobea timonioides), hala pepe (Pleomele aurea), and ƒÅlaa (Pouteria sandwicensis). It occurs naturally in only three locations on Kauai: Nounou Mountain, the cliffs of the NƒÅ Pali Coast, and Haupu Ridge near NƒÅwiliwili Bay. History Polyscias racemosa first entered the botanical literature in 1917, when it was described and named as Tetraplasandra racemosa by Charles Noyes Forbes.Charles Noyes Forbes. 1917. \\"New Hawaiian Plants.-VI.\\" Occasional Papers of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum 6(4):51. (See External links below). Earl Edward Sherff felt that this species was uniquely distinct from the rest of Tetraplasandra, so he erected a new genus for it, Munroidendron, in 1952.Munroidendron in International Plant Names Index. (see External links below). The genus was named for George Campbell Munro (1866-1963), described by Umberto Quattrocchi as \\"a pioneer in Hawaiian ornithology, botany, and horticulture; plant collector in the Hawaiian Islands\\".Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names, volume III. CRC Press: Baton Rouge, New York, London, Washington DC. (vol. III). (see External links below). Dendron is a Greek word for \\"tree\\". Munro was apparently the first collector to see his eponymous genus, Munroidendron.Earl Edward Sherff. 1952. \\"Munroidendron, a new genus of Araliaceous trees from the island of Kauai\\". Botanical Leaflets 7(section V):21-24. published by the author. Sherff separated Munroidendron from Tetraplasandra on the basis of five characters: the absence of umbellules, the arrangement of the flowers in a raceme, the sunken, diamond-shaped pedicel scars, the long, persistence of the subtending floral bracts, and the insertion of the stamens in only one whorl, even when numerous. It has been shown that, in spite of its appearance, the inflorescence is not truly a raceme because it is determinate. Sherff divided the species now known as Polyscias racemosa into three varieties: var. racemosa, var. forbesii, and var. macdanielsii. These have been described as \\"not sufficiently distinct to be retained\\". The establishment of Munroidendron was contentious from the beginning. William R. Philipson said that Munroidendron \\"comprises a single species with such a distinct inflorescence and corolla that it can well claim generic status.William R. Philipson. 1970. \\"A redefinition of Gastonia and related genera (Araliaceae)\\". Blumea 18(2):497-505. In 1971, a pollen study indicated that Munroidendron might be embedded in Tetraplasandra.Charles C. Tseng. 1971. \\"Light and Scanning Electron Microscopic Studies on Pollen of Tetraplasandra (Araliaceae) and Relatives\\". American Journal of Botany 58(6):505-516. This result was not supported by molecular phylogenetic studies based on DNA sequences of nuclear and chloroplast DNA regions. These studies show that Polyscias sandwicensis (formerly Reynoldsia sandwicensis is not most closely related to other species of Reynoldsia, but is sister to Polyscias racemosa, (formerly Munroidendron).Annemarie Costello and Timothy J. Motley. 2007. \\"Phylogenetics of the Tetraplasandra Group (Araliaceae) Inferred from ITS, 5S-NTS, and Morphology\\". Systematic Botany 32(2):464-477. This pair is then sister to a monophyletic Tetraplasandra in the sense of Philipson (1970). This pair of species and the nine species formerly in Tetraplasandra form a clade and comprise all of the Hawaiian species of Polyscias. The 11 species of this \\"Hawaiian clade\\" and 10 species from Malesia, Melanesia, and southern Polynesia constitute Polyscias subgenus Tetraplasandra.

Diffusion creep is more sensitive to temperature than other deformation mechanisms. It usually takes place at high homologous temperatures (i.e. within about a tenth of its absolute melting temperature). Diffusion creep is caused by the migration of crystalline defects through the lattice of a crystal such that when a crystal is subjected to a greater degree of compression in one direction relative to another, defects migrate to the crystal faces along the direction of compression, causing a net mass transfer that shortens the crystal in the direction of maximum compression. The migration of defects is in part due to vacancies, whose migration is equal to a net mass transport in the opposite direction. Principle Crystalline materials are never perfect on a microscale. Some sites of atoms in the crystal lattice can be occupied by point defects, such as \\"alien\\" particles or vacancies. Vacancies can actually be thought of as chemical species themselves (or part of a compound species/component) that may then be treated using heterogeneous phase equilibria. The number of vacancies may also be influenced by the number of chemical impurities in the crystal lattice, if such impurities require the formation of vacancies to exist in the lattice. A vacancy can move through the crystal structure when the neighbouring particle \\"jumps\\" in the vacancy, so that the vacancy moves in effect one site in the crystal lattice. Chemical bonds need to be broken and new bonds have to be formed during the process,Twiss & Moores 2000, p. 391 therefore a certain activation energy is needed. Moving a vacancy through a crystal becomes therefore easier when the temperature is higher. The most stable state will be when all vacancies are evenly spread through the crystal. This principle follows from Fick's law: : J_x = -D_x \\\\frac{\\\\Delta C}{\\\\Delta x} In which Jx stands for the flux (\\"flow\\") of vacancies in direction x; Dx is a constant for the material in that direction and {\\\\Delta C}/{\\\\Delta x} is the difference in concentration of vacancies in that direction. The law is valid for all principal directions in (x, y, z)-space, so the x in the formula can be exchanged for y or z. The result will be that they will become evenly distributed over the crystal, which will result in the highest mixing entropy. When a mechanical stress is applied to the crystal, new vacancies will be created at the sides perpendicular to the direction of the lowest principal stress. The vacancies will start moving in the direction of crystal planes perpendicular to the maximal stress.Twiss & Moores 2000; p. 390-391 Current theory holds that the elastic strain in the neighborhood of a defect is smaller toward the axis of greatest differential compression, creating a defect chemical potential gradient (depending upon lattice strain) within the crystal that leads to net accumulation of defects at the faces of maximum compression by diffusion. A flow of vacancies is the same as a flow of particles in the opposite direction. This means a crystalline material can deform under a differential stress, by the flow of vacancies. Highly mobile chemical components substituting for other species in the lattice can also cause a net differential mass transfer (i.e. segregation) of chemical species inside the crystal itself, often promoting shortening of the rheologically more difficult substance and enhancing deformation. Types of diffusion creep Diffusion of vacancies through a crystal can happen in a number of ways. When vacancies move through the crystal (in the material sciences often called a \\"grain\\"), this is called Nabarro‚ÄìHerring creep. Another way in which vacancies can move is along the grain boundaries, a mechanism called Coble creep. When a crystal deforms by diffusion creep to accommodate space problems from simultaneous grain boundary sliding (the movement of whole grains along grain boundaries) this is called granular or superplastic flow.Twiss & Moores 2000, p. 394 Diffusion creep can also be simultaneous with pressure solution. Pressure solution is, like Coble creep, a mechanism in which material moves along grain boundaries. While in Coble creep the particles move by \\"dry\\" diffusion, in pressure solution they move in solution. Flow laws Each plastic deformation of a material can be described by a formula in which the strain rate (\\\\dot{\\\\epsilon}) depends on the differential stress (œÉ or œÉD), the grain size (d) and an activation value in the form of an Arrhenius equation:Passchier & Trouw 1998; p. 54 \\\\\\\\!\\\\dot{\\\\epsilon} = Ae^\\\\frac{-Q}{RT} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^n}{d^m} In which A is the constant of diffusion, Q the activation energy of the mechanism, R the gas constant and T the absolute temperature (in kelvins). The exponents n and m are values for the sensitivity of the flow to stress and grain size respectively. The values of A, Q, n and m are different for each deformation mechanism. For diffusion creep, the value of n is usually around 1. The value for m can vary between 2 (Nabarro-Herring creep) and 3 (Coble creep). That means Coble creep is more sensitive to grain size of a material: materials with larger grains can deform less easily by Coble creep than materials with small grains. Traces of diffusion creep It is difficult to find clear microscale evidence for diffusion creep in a crystalline material, since few structures have been identified as definite proof. A material that was deformed by diffusion creep can have flattened grains (grains with a so called shape-preferred orientation or SPO). Equidimensional grains with no lattice-preferred orientation (or LPO) can be an indication for superplastic flow.Passchier & Trouw 1998; p. 42 In materials that were deformed under very high temperatures, lobate grain boundaries may be taken as evidence for diffusion creep.Gower & Simpson 1992 Diffusion creep is a mechanism by which the volume of the crystals can increase. Larger grain sizes can be a sign that diffusion creep was more effective in a crystalline material.

The ‚ÄúUrban Elder‚Äù was a fifth generation grandson of Mistawasis, a hereditary Cree chief, and a sixth generation grandson of Big Bear. He had a difficult and traumatic childhood, and was placed into the foster care system. Service in the Military Vern Harper was a United States military veteran. At the young age of 17, from 1952-1953 he served in The Korean War in the 82ND Airborne Division. He was a paratrooper specializing in parachute assault operations into denied areas. Political activism  In the mid to late 1960s he was the personal body guard of legendary singer Janis Joplin. Beginning in the late 1960s, he was the leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in Toronto, Canada. Harper became politically active as Vice-President of the Ontario Metis and Non-Status Indian Association in 1972. Vern united the Toronto Warrior Society with the Ojibway Warrior Society of Kenora (led by Louis Cameron) and the Regina Warrior Society (led by Wayne Stonechild) to create the Native People‚Äôs Caravan in 1974, a cross Canada trek to raise awareness of broken treaties and grievances against the Canadian government. Together they were Dissidents for Native Peoples Rights. In 1976, he founded the Wandering Spirit Survival School of Toronto (now known as First Nations School of Toronto). He was the author of Following The Red Road: The Native People‚Äôs Caravan, 1974 (1979). Later life and career Mr. Harper was one of a few First Nations Elders with Chaplain Status, as recognized by the Correctional Service of Canada. As such, he provided spiritual services, sweat lodge ceremonies and traditional counseling to Aboriginal inmates. He also counseled Aboriginal youth offenders. In 1997, Mr. Harper was the subject of the documentary Urban Elder by Robert S. Adams which chronicled his life and role of community leader and Traditional Elder in an urban setting. Mr. Harper served as Resident Elder at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto further promoting the role of First Nations spirituality in the treatment of mental health and addiction.https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/10/25/no_more_burn_with_vern_for_native_people_at_camh_fiorito.html Elder Vern Harper-Asin was the Elder for the \\"Reaching Out: Child Abuse Monument\\" http://www.childabusemonument.com.

An eight- member executive committee was headed by the more moderate Sharif Sheikh Ahmed.'Radical' heads new Somali body, BBC News, 25 June 2006 The BBC stated \\"It is still not clear which man is more powerful.\\"Winter, Joseph, Profile: Somalia's Islamist leader, BBC News, 27 June 2006 Aweys resigned from the ICU on 28 December 2006, at the end of ICU rule in Mogadishu. He hails from the Habargidir/Ayr subclan within the Hawiye clan. History During the regime of Siad Barre, Aweys was a colonel in the Somali National Army (SNA) during the 1977 Ogaden War against Ethiopia during which he was decorated for bravery. 1994‚Äì2002: Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya (AIAI) Dahir Aweys was part of AIAI leadership which took over large parts of Somalia immediately following the collapse of the Somali Central Government. From 1991 to 1998, AIAI's Gedo Region branch led by former Somali High Court Judge Mohamed Haji Yusuf maintained formidable forces. Gedo district seats of Lugh, Balad Hawo and Burdubo were all run by IAIA forces. Lugh was entirely governed by AIAI. At the time, there were other regional military authority Somali National Front (SNF) running parts of Gedo. Dahir Aweys settled in Lower Shabelle when some disputes came of light in Lugh's Al-Itahad leadership. On 18 September 1996, the Ethiopian army invaded Lugh and forced out most of the AIAI forces. The following two years, the war front changed into what was later to become the Mountains War of Gedo. And the war this time was between SNF and AIAI. The Ethiopian regime just armed SNF militias. Ethiopians gave SNF an estimated 800 to 1000 small arms and around a dozen heavy weapons. The Gedo war ended when both sides agreed on a truce, and general peace with a peace conference held in El Ade on December 1998 was concluded. AIAI was destroyed later in the 1990s by a force led by Abdullahi Yusuf and funded by Ethiopia. On 7 November 2001, Aweys was named a 'supporter of terrorism' in a supplement of Executive Order 13224 of United States President George W. Bush.Suspected Terrorist List, list maintained by the U.S. Commonwealth of Massachusetts Aweys is also on the terrorist list of the United States Department of StateMeet the Press U.S. Senator Russ Feingold calls Aweys \\"an al-Qaeda operative or somebody that is connected with al-Qaeda.\\" 25 June 2006 as somebody who is known as an al- Qaeda operative or who is connected with al-Qaeda. When Abdullahi tYusuf Ahmed was elected President in 2004, Aweys declared that he would support the new leader, even if he pursued former elements of al-Itihaad, as long as the country was ruled according to Islam. 2004‚Äì2006: Islamic Courts Union (ICU) After the defeat of AIAI Aweys played a key role in setting up a system of courts according to the shari'a by local businessmen desperate for order, becoming its spiritual head. The Courts brought relative stability to areas under its control, after years of turmoil. The Courts' notion of order was strict, including stonings for serious crimes such as rape and murder. At first it only controlled the area of north Mogadishu, but it gained support from many Somali's following the random violence committed by the warlords who controlled southern Mogadishu. Beginning 2004, eleven of these courts folded into an umbrella organization, the Islamic Courts Union, which fielded a formidable militia. A UN report in early 2006 stated that Aweys was receiving military support from Eritrea, as part of the ongoing conflict between it and Ethiopia, though Eritrea denies the claim. Following the Union's victory in Mogadishu in June 2006, Aweys rose to be the head of the shura committee, replacing Sharif Sheik Ahmed. The Courts' second-in-command Abdulakdir Ali stated day-to-day matters would be handled by Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's executive committee.Ethiopia says Somalia 'a threat', BBC News, 28 June 2006 On 21 July 2006, Hassan Aweys, in a radio broadcast, urged holy war on Ethiopian troops stationed in Baidoa to support the UN-backed government of Somalia. On 19 December 2006, he received medical treatment in Egypt just before the beginning of the war against the UN-backed Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Ethiopian troops. On 21 December 2006, as the fighting intensified with Ethiopia, he took a flight to an undisclosed location with Yusuf Mohammed Siad Inda'ade, and rather than news of medical treatment, it was said he was on the hajj. On 27 December 2006, Aweys, along with a group of several hundred fighters from the Hizbul Islam wing of the ICU fled Mogadishu, presumably to the former AIAI base at Ras Kamboni. On 31 December 2006, he vowed to fight on, and called for others to create an insurgency against the government. Meanwhile, a heavily armed column of government and Ethiopian troops advanced from Mogadishu through Lower Shabelle towards Kismayo. They reached Bulo Marer (Kurtun Warrey district) and were heading to Baravo. In January 2007, his whereabouts remained generally unknown, but it was believed he was ailing. 2007‚Äì2009: Alliance for the Liberation of Somalia (ARS) In September 2007, he emerged in Eritrea forming a new rebellion. The Djibouti peace-talks between the ARS and the TFG, however, led to a split in the organisation, with the Djibouti-based \\"moderate\\" faction led by Sharif Ahmed eventually signing the agreement and joining the TFG and the Eritrea-based \\"hard-liner\\" faction led by Hassan Dahir Aweys refusing to do so and advocating continuation armed resistance.ARS Central Committee conference opens in Djibouti 2009‚Äì2010: Hizbul Islam (HI) In early 2009, four major rebel groups, Aweys' Asmara- based wing of the ARS, Hassan Abdullah Hersi al-Turki's Ras Kamboni Brigade, Jabhatul Islamiya and Muaskar Anole joined together to form a new group called Hizbul Islam, vowing to continue the rebellion against the new government of President Sharif Ahmed.allafrica Islamists want to keep fighting against the new government Although the group was initially led by Omar Iman Abubakar, he stepped down on 26 May 2009 in favour of Aweys taking the position of chairman.7 killed in violence, Aweys crowned Hizbul Islam chief On 23 April 2009, Aweys returned to Somalia declaring a war on the African Peace Keeping Forces AMISOM. He made clear that he would not meet Sharif Ahmed saying: > \\"Mr Sharif's government was not elected by the Somali people and it is not > representing the interests the Somali people\\" He accused the President of being an instrument of the international community and on 9 May 2009, Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab tried to topple the Government of Sharif Ahmed by opening the 2009 Battle of Mogadishu, which lasted for months, in which the Islamists managed to gain territory but failed ultimately to topple the regime. Mogadishu residents reported that they saw foreign fighters in the frontline of the battle, raising concerns that Somalia may become the next terrorist safe haven after Iraq and Afghanistan. In June 2009, it was rumoured he had been killed during the Battle of Wabho. He later dismissed reports that he was killed or heavily injured.Aweys Resurfaces to Dispel Claims of Being Wounded After the Battle of Kisimayo (2009) the group was involved in an unsuccessful power-struggle with al-Shabaab in which Hizbul Islam was ultimately forced to surrender, after which they merged with al- Shabaab on 20 December 2010 under the banner of al-Shabaab, dropping the name Hizbul Islam. 2010‚Äì2013: Al-Shabaab (HSM) Aweys was involved in the power struggle between Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansoor) and Moktar Ali Zubeyr (Godane), during which he supported Abu Mansoor in demanding that Godane would step down as the group's Emir. Aweys had been described as Hizbul Islam's political and spiritual leader. In June 2013, Aweys was taken into custody by Somali security forces, denoting the victory of the hardliners in al-Shabab. However, the nature of his arrest‚Äîinitially being promised talks with government officials and then being roughed up by soldiers when arrested instead‚Äîhas created concern that it could cause the Hawiye clan of the president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Aweys to split.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1997. linkj The decision to build the tunnel came from the need for a more durable and less interrupted way to cross the new canal situated directly above it via vehicles. Built in 1876, the tunnel is located between locks 18 and 19 of the former third Welland Canal, was built using Queenston limestone and spans a total length of 713 feet when including the winged stone work at either end. Hundreds of men armed with picks and shovels, as well as several horses were used in the excavation of the tunnel. The tunnel was used periodically until 1915, when Harry Eastwood was the last official engineer to pilot a train through the tunnel. Following that, the tunnel was used only occasionally by farmers to transport cattle or as a safe passage from the weather. Accidents Several fatal accidents occurred during the construction and use of the tunnel and the railway running through it. In 1875, a fourteen-year-old was killed when he was crushed under a large rock. On January 3, 1903 at 7:03 AM, Engine Number 4 and Engine Number 975 met in a head-on collision approximately a third of a mile from the western entrance of the tunnel. The trains were moving at approximately 22 miles per hour when they crashed, and the firemen of both trains, Charles Harning of Engine Number 4 and Abraham Desult from Engine Number 975, died as a result of their injuries. In total, 107 men were killed during the construction of the tunnel and the canal in its surrounding area.

Born in New Zealand, he was the eldest son of Auckland architect Robert Wladislas (Potocki) de Montalk, grandson of Paris-born Professor Count Joseph Wladislas Edmond Potocki de Montalk, and great-grandson of Polish-born Count Jozef Franciszek Jan Potocki, the Insurgent, of Bia≈Çystok.√âcrits de Paris: revue des questions actuelles, Centre d'√©tudes des questions actuelles, politiques, √©conomiques et sociales, 2007 In 1926, de Montalk left his wife and small daughter in New Zealand to be a poet by \\"...follow(ing) the golden road to Samarkand\\". He travelled to England but moved in 1949 to Draguignan in the south of France where he obtained land and a ramshackle stone cottage ‚Äì the Villa Vigoni ‚Äì deep in the Proven√ßal countryside. He did not return to New Zealand until 1983. Between 1984 and 1993, he followed the sun by spending summers in either New Zealand or France. He died at Brignoles in France in 1997 and was buried at Draguignan. Career Geoffrey Potocki de Montalk was one of a group of New Zealand poets which included his friends A. R. D. Fairburn and R. A. K. Mason. However, his proposed career as a romantic poet was severely affected by a court case in 1932. He was arrested after attempting to publish a manuscript of erotic translations of works by Rabelais and Verlaine, with three short bawdy verses of his own. Though the manuscript had not actually been published, it had been shown to a printer at the Methodist Recorder in London who reported de Montalk to the police on the grounds of obscenity. The subsequent charge was \\"obscene libel\\", specifically in relation to the work \\"Lament for Sir John Penis\\". On 8 February 1932, he appeared before Sir Ernest Wild, Recorder of London at the Central Criminal Court and after a celebrated trial ‚Äì at which he was supported by Leonard and Virginia Woolf and many of the leading writers of the day ‚Äì he was sentenced to six months in Wormwood Scrubs. He later said that when it was asked who had been libelled, the answer given by the prosecution was \\"Sir John Penis\\"! He emerged from prison bitter and determined to flout English convention. He adopted a mock-medieval style of dress, wearing sandals and a crimson tunic, and a cloak made from a length of scarlet curtain he had begun wearing soon after arrival in London and had worn during his trial. His hair, which had been allowed to grow in prison, continued to grow until it was waist length. After his release he travelled to Warsaw, where he was well received and reported on by the newspapers. He returned to England in 1935, to cover the Silver Jubilee of George V, who died shortly thereafter. When Edward VIII declared his intention to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, against the wishes of Prime Minister Baldwin, and was forced to abdicate, Potocki de Montalk printed a manifesto supporting the King and chastising Baldwin, distributing copies in Downing Street and was arrested. Aldous Huxley sent his wife to arrange bail and later funded the purchase of Potocki's first printing press. Potocki married for the second time in 1939. From 1936 onwards, Potocki produced his extreme right-wing literary publication, the Right Review (1936‚Äì73).Patrick Deane, History in Our Hands: a critical anthology of writings on literature, culture, and politics from the 1930s.

The intellectuals and the Spanish civil war. London: W. H. Allen, 1968. (p. 157, 165‚Äì6) The first issue of The Right Review, in October carried a statement of Potocki's own monarchist position: > It is our aim to show that the Divine Right of Kings is the sanest and best > form of government, being in the last resort the only fount of power and > consequently of human life. We intend to prove that such government is > intensely beneficial to the whole human race including the lowest races of > mankind. In this way we hope to provide the Right Wing with a living > ideology.Alvin Sullivan,British literary magazines: The modern age, > 1914‚Äì1984 London : Greenwood Press, 1986. (p. 409). The publication was noted for its strong support of the Spanish Nationalists; it attacked T. S. Eliot for not expressing support for the Nationalists. The Right Review also published poetry by Roy Campbell and D. S. Savage. Over the next four decades, Potocki published his own poetry and pamphlets. In 1943, informed by Poles living in London about the massacre in the woods at Katyn of 15,000 Polish servicemen by Britain's ally, the Soviet Union, Potocki published what he considered to be his most important piece of writing, his Katyn Manifesto. The British government had been keen to keep the atrocity quiet, which the Soviet Union blamed on Nazi Germany. Potocki was arrested by Special Branch and imprisoned. Later, he was sent to an agricultural camp in Northumberland. This manifesto was the only acknowledgement of the atrocity in English. The full truth of the Katyn massacre was not to emerge for another 50 years.http://strangeflowers.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/the-katyn-connection/ The Katyn connection His arrest and conviction was reported as related to the blackout regulations as he was showing a light, and he was reported as saying in court Heil Hitler.

They came to prominence after singing backing vocals in Joe Camilleri's band The Black Sorrows from 1988. They left that group early in 1994 to start their duo with a self-titled album appearing in June that year. The duo scored their first number 1 album in 2020, with their retrospective Akilotoa: Anthology (1994-2006).  History  =1966‚Äì1982: Early years= Vika Susan Bull was born in 1966 in Doncaster, the older sister of Linda Rose Bull. Their mother, who was from Tonga, arrived in Australia in 1959 as a nursing student. Their father, whose parents were local orchardists, was from Melbourne. The family maintained close links to the local Tongan community, and the sisters were taught traditional singing and dancing. As children, they regularly performed with the family at dinner dances and the Tongan church they attended. After church they would have a Tongan feast, Vika recalled in 1995, \\"It didn't matter what the occasion was we would sing. We had harmonies around us ..., and now we mainly sing gospel .... It's a way of letting loose, which is what gospel music is all about\\". Vika received musical training. She had singing lessons, was taught the piano and how to read music. Vika and Linda both attended Camberwell Girls Grammar School. Vika left at the age of 17 to train as a legal secretary at Stotts College. Both worked at the Black Cat Cafe in their teens in Fitzroy. While growing up, the sisters had separate ambitions: Vika wanted to be a professional singer; Linda wanted to be either a visual artist or a microbiologist. Vika started training as a secretary, while Linda entered university. They both enjoyed singing, with their mother, an early coach, noticing their sibling vocal harmony. Vika recalled, \\"Our mother taught us to sing in harmony. [She] said, 'Linda, you got the low voice. You take the low part.' I took the high part\\". Vika's early influences were Aretha Franklin, Etta James and Ruth Brown. Linda's influences were Linda Ronstadt, Aretha Franklin and Dolly Parton. =1983‚Äì1987: Blue Tomatoes, Fear of Flying, Sophisticated Boom Boom & The Honeymooners= By 1983 Vika had started a band, Blue Tomatoes, with one of the caf√©'s co-owners, Toni Edwards. They played cover versions of soul songs and a few originals. In 1984 Vika became a backing singer in a Melbourne band, Fear of Flying. After two years Vika joined Sophisticated Boom Boom. Other members of that group were Jenny Tubbs (now Barbato), Louise Taunt, Steve Purcell, Steve Dagg, Kerri Simpson, and Jeremy Rasmussen. Vika started working as a receptionist at Platinum Studios, a recording studio. In 1987, Linda left university and joined Vika in Sophisticated Boom Boom. Vika also performed with John Justin and Thunderwings alongside Justin, Tony Featherstone, Paul Hines, Carl Manuel, Gordon Pitts, and Robert Woodrow. Later in 1987 the sisters formed their own band, The Honeymooners, with a line up of Jack Abeyratne, Thiery Fossmalle on bass guitar, and Steve Sedergreen. Vika met John Watson, drummer (ex- Australian Crawl, Kevin Borich Express) in James Reyne Band, and they married in 1997. Vika's first recording opportunity occurred when Rebecca Barnard was using the Platinum Studios and one of her backing vocalists \\"lost her voice\\". Vika, the receptionist, was now a backing singer. Early in 1988 Vika released her debut solo single, \\"Livin' Hell\\", which was soon followed by a second single, \\"My House\\". Vika and Linda worked with Barnard and Simpson in The Sacred Hearts of Sweet Temptation. =1988‚Äì1993: Success with The Black Sorrows= By mid-1988, Vika and Linda had joined The Black Sorrows, a blues- rock group, which had formed in 1983 by Joe Camilleri (ex-Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) on lead vocals and saxophone. The group's drummer, Peter Luscombe, recommended the sisters to Camilleri. They provided backing vocals on The Black Sorrows' fifth studio album, Hold On to Me (September 1988). The line-up was Vika and Linda, Camilleri, and Luscombe; with Wayne Burt on guitar; Jeff Burstin on guitar (both ex-Falcons); and Mick Girasole on bass guitar. The album peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Vika and Linda provided backing vocals on the band's hits on the related ARIA Singles Chart, \\"Hold On to Me\\", \\"Chained to the Wheel\\" and \\"The Crack-Up\\". For live gigs, Camilleri would give each their own \\"spots\\" displaying different voices: \\"Vika strong and soulful. Linda soft and gentle\\". Their second album with The Black Sorrows was Harley & Rose (November 1990) and saw the duo provide lead vocals on some of the album tracks. It peaked at No. 3 and provided two top 30 singles, \\"Harley + Rose\\" and \\"Never Let Me Go\\". Better Times was released in September 1992 and peaked at No. 13. They followed with a compilation album, The Chosen Ones ‚Äì Greatest Hits, in November 1993 which reached No. 4. The group toured in support of its release, Nicole Leedham of The Canberra Times noted that the band \\"has also been through the odd line-up change, with the latest incarnations offering the harmonies of Vika and Linda Bull, being the most successful\\". Vika praised Camillleri. \\"He taught us that you have to take care of your own career, because no one else will do it for you. He taught us to watch every cent, to make sure your band is happy, and how to deal with the public\\". While members of The Black Sorrows, the duo provided vocals for other artists: Hunters and Collectors' What's a Few Men? (November 1987) and Ghost Nation (November 1989); Ross Wilson's Dark Side of the Man (July 1989); Archie Roach's Charcoal Lane (May 1990); John Farnham's Chain Reaction (September 1990); Seven Stories' Judges and Bagmen (1990); Deborah Conway's String of Pearls (October 1991) and Bitch Epic (1993). During the recording of Charcoal Lane, they met Paul Kelly, its producer, and a singer-songwriter in his own right. =1994‚Äì2001: Vika and Linda, Princess Tabu & Two Wings= By February 1994 Vika and Linda had announced they would leave The Black Sorrows and were \\"branching into their solo careers\\". They began performing original works and country music covers at venues like the Cherry Tree and The Esplanade. They prepared material for their debut self-titled album. In March 1994 they performed at Canberra's National Food and Wine Frolic, where they presented their new material. Also that year the duo was invited to Tonga to sing at celebrations for the 75th birthday of King TƒÅufa ªƒÅhau Tupou. The duo's self- titled debut album was released in June 1994 on Mushroom Records and was produced by Kelly. A bonus disc, containing five gospel songs, was included with the special edition of the album. Kelly also provided guitars and backing vocals. Other session musicians were Burstin on guitars; Luscombe on drums; Stephen Hadley on bass guitar; and Jex Saarelaht on keyboards. All tracks on the standard edition were originals. Kelly had offered twelve tracks (they recorded five) including \\"Ninety Nine Years\\", which had been co-written with Vika and Linda. Three other tracks were written specifically for the duo, \\"When Will You Fall For Me\\" by Mark Seymour (of Hunters & Collectors), \\"House of Love\\" by Wayne Burt, and \\"These Hands That Hold Me\\" by Eris O'Brien. \\"When Will You Fall For Me\\" and \\"House of Love\\" were both featured as backing music on the soap opera, Home and Away. Other tracks were written by Camilleri and Stephen Cummings. Linda told The Canberra Times Naomi Mapstone \\"it was amazing how friendly and helpful these people were, they could just as easily have said no because they're so busy\\". Another The Canberra Times review described their music as \\"a mix of blues, reggae, rock and country-flavoured offerings\\". The album peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and was certified platinum. It was also nominated for an ARIA Music Award in 1995 for 'Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Album'. In New Zealand it reached No. 16 on New Zealand Albums Chart in April 1995. Vika and Linda had four singles, \\"When Will You Fall For Me\\" (May 1994), \\"House of Love\\" (August 1994), \\"Hard Love\\" (December 1994) and \\"We've Started a Fire\\" (1995). None made the top 50 in Australia although \\"House of Love\\" reached No. 32 in New Zealand. In November 1994 they supported Billy Joel on his Australian tour for three weeks. During the next year, they toured Europe with a backing band, which included Michael Barker on percussion. While in the UK they spent a week at Peter Gabriel's studio recording. At the Mouth of the River was a compilation of tracks, which was released on the Real World label. One of the tracks, \\" I Know Where to Go to Feel Good\\", was recorded with Iggy Pop. Also in the UK they worked at the World of Recording Week, a WOMAD (World Of Music Art and Dance) event. Their second studio album, Princess Tabu, was released in August 1996, peaking at No. 30 in Australia. It was co-produced by Vika and Linda with Jeremy Allom and Diesel. It has tracks co-written by the sisters with various collaborators including Barker, Diesel, Kelly, and Tim Finn. Additional musicians used were Barker, Diesel, Stuart Fraser, Bruce Haynes and Stuart Speed. It was recorded in Melbourne, Sydney and in Tonga ‚Äì where they \\"paid their respects to the nation's monarch King Taufa'ahu Tupou\\". Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt the album was a \\"purer reflection of the cultural strains and rich diversity of their heritage\\". An extended version of Princess Tabu was issued in the following year, which included a bonus live disc ‚Äì with acoustic versions of earlier material recorded at the Continental Hotel, Prahan. During the next few years the duo toured and prepared material for a third studio album, Two Wings. In the interim Linda and Stanford had their first child, as did Vika and Watson. The sisters released their third studio album, Two Wings, in August 1999, a collection of spiritual songs, which McFarlane described as an \\"inspired song selection ranging from blues and gospel to reggae and soul\\". It was co-produced by Ren√©e Geyer with Kelly and includes tracks written by Kelly, Roach, Bob Marley and Tim Rogers. The album peaked at No. 34 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and was nominated for 'Best Adult Contemporary Album' at the ARIA Music Awards of 2000. In November 2000 they released a live album, Live and Acoustic, recorded at the Continental Hotel. It was co-produced by the sisters with Burstin. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, declared it to be his Album of the Week, noting that it \\"brings us back to the start, pure Vika and Linda, just singing together, as they always have and always will, applying all the experience and confidence they've accumulated, more gospel than you might expect\\". In the following year, Vika and Linda were released by the merged Festival Mushroom Records Vika and Linda now promoted and distributed their new music, although Mushroom still held the rights to their back catalogue. =2002‚Äì2017: Love is Mighty Close, Between Two Shores= Vika and Linda's fourth studio album, Love is Mighty Close, was released independently in July 2002 using a country-blues style. Tracks were written by Cummings, Kelly, Cyndi Boste, Dan Brodie, Rob Snarski and Chris Wilson. The album failed to chart but it was nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002. Following its release, the sisters focussed on their gospel roots. The backing band's line-up changed, with Burstin replaced on guitar by Dion Hirini. During a three month residency at the Cornish Arms, Vika and Linda played and recorded gospel tunes; which resulted in a second live album, Tell the Angels, in May 2004. Backing Paul Kelly at Southbound, Busselton, January 2011 After the release of Tell the Angels, the sisters took a break from performing as a duo, during which Linda and Stanford had their second child, with Linda spending more time with parenting responsibilities. In 2005, the sisters opened a children's wear shop in North Fitzroy, Hoochie Coochie. From November that year they presented six episodes of a TV series, Pacific Stories, on ABC2. Episode 5, \\"Fit for a King\\", broadcast on 15 December detailed the 1994 celebrations where the duo sang for the king of Tonga. In September 2006, Liberation Blue released Vika and Linda's fifth studio album, Between Two Shores. In December of that year, MGM Distribution re-issued four of their early albums: Vika and Linda, Princess Tabu, Two Wings and Live & Acoustic. During the 2010s, the sisters frequently provided backing vocals for the guest artist on the TV show RocKwiz. On 1 October 2016, Vika and Linda sang the national anthem at the 2016 AFL Grand Final. Cameron Adams from news.com.au said, \\"Their majestic harmonies supplied even more goosebumps on a day already charged with emotion. Anyone who has to sing the national anthem at a major sporting event in the future needs to YouTube this as research\\". =2018‚Äìpresent: 'Akilotoa and Sunday (The Gospel According to Iso)= In July 2018, Vika indicated that the duo are in the process of preparing songs for a new Vika & Linda album (the first album of new material since 2002), that will include songwriting contributions from Paul Kelly, Kasey Chambers, Dan Kelly, and Linda Bull (where Linda is collaborating with Paul Kelly on a few tracks). Vika has indicated that the album will be recorded in February 2019, with an impending release sometime in 2019. In November 2019, the duo were inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the duo live streamed a series of singing sessions via Facebook, where they sang songs for their fans. In May 2020, the duo confirmed the release of their first greatest hits album, titled 'Akilotoa which was released on 12 June 2020 and debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Charts, becoming their first chart topper. In June 2020, the duo confirmed they would record their sixth studio album in July 2020. On 24 July 2020, the duo announced the release of Sunday (The Gospel According to Iso), a gospel album recorded on Sundays during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The album was released in September 2020.

These individuals pass on the information they learned during their training, as volunteers who advise and educate the public on gardening and horticulture. Background The first Master Gardener program was founded in 1973 by Dr. David Gibby of Washington State University Cooperative Extension in the greater Tacoma area to meet a high demand for urban horticulture and gardening advice. The first trial clinic was held at the Tacoma Mall in 1972. When that was successful, the Master Gardener Program was officially established, a curriculum created, and training began in King County and Pierce County in 1973.Master Gardener Program History , by David Gibby, William Scheer, Sharon Collmen, George Pinyuh, Tonie Fitzgerald The concept then spread to other U.S. states and Canadian provinces. In the US, groups are affiliated with a land-grant university and one of its cooperative extension service offices. Canadian Master Gardener groups have different organizational structures, including incorporation as a charitable non-profit (Ontario) and universities (Saskatchewan). Typically, Master Gardeners receive extensive training and then provide information to the public via phone or email helplines, speaking at public events, writing articles for publications and the internet, and partnering with other community programs, gardens, and educational facilities. Master Gardeners are active in all 50 states in the United States and eight Canadian provinces. According to the 2009 Extension Master Gardener Survey, there are nearly 95,000 active Extension Master Gardeners, who provide approximately 5,000,000 volunteer service hours of per year to their communities. Once volunteers are accepted into a Master Gardener program, they are trained by cooperative extension, university, and local industry specialists in subjects such as taxonomy, plant pathology, soil health, entomology, cultural growing requirements, sustainable gardening, nuisance wildlife management, and integrated pest management. After completing training, master gardeners serve their communities by providing guidance to others and maintaining community and historic gardens. Awards are regularly presented to master gardeners for community service, innovative programs, and other topics.

The TEL features a large hydraulic crane used for reloading rockets from 9T29 transporters (also ZIL-135 based). The 9M21 has a range up to 70 km and a CEP (circular error probable) between 500 m and 700 m. The road mobile rocket has a 550 kg warhead and is capable of delivering high explosive, nuclear, or chemical warheads. History Six of the initial version of the 9M21 were in Cuba during the missile crisis in October 1962. These missiles, which were ready to fire, had nuclear warheads installed. A further 70 warheads were stockpiled on the island. The Luna was later extensively deployed throughout some Soviet satellite states. The rocket has been widely exported and is now in the possession of a large number of countries. = Syria = In what became its first use in combat, Syrian forces fired a FROG-7 barrage at Galilee on 7 October and 8 October 1973, in the course of the Yom Kippur War.

Demetrios was given the title of sebastokrator by Emperor John V Palaiologos in December 1357 and went to the Peloponnese with his father and grandfather in 1361. One of at least two sons of Matthew Kantakouzenos, he disputed the succession to the Despotate of the Morea with Theodore I Palaiologos, the son of John V between 1380 and 1384.

His influences include: The Beatles, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Stevie Wonder, The Eagles, Queen, Earth Wind And Fire and Bob Marley. By the age of twelve, he taught himself how to play guitar and formed his first band. At age 20, Philip worked on the road backing the Surf music genre duo, Jan and Dean as their bassist and backup vocalist. Consequently, Mike Love of The Beach Boys, hired Philip to serve as lead guitarist and vocalist in his Endless Summer Beach Band. In 1993, Philip teamed up with Peter Criss and Ace Frehley of KISS fronting Peter's band \\"CRISS\\" as lead singer and rhythm guitarist. It was after serving this role for two years that Philip discovered that he felt a void just singing and playing music for the sole purpose of entertainment and began attending Saddleback Church in Orange County, CA in search of a new purpose for his life. After a while, he was asked to audition for the praise team, and by the grace of God, he was asked to join the praise team and began serving regularly as a vocalist and musician. This led to his acceptance of Jesus Christ as his personal Savior. \\"I came to Christ by worshipping Him through song. He entered my heart through my praise and worship of Him and my life was changed forever. Philip had found a new passion in serving The Lord, but continued in his career as a professional musician Philip befriended Beach Boy, Carl Wilson, when Carl heard him sing at a birthday party for Beach Boy frontman, Mike Love. Carl called on Philip to sing his parts as a member of the Beach Boys touring band when he became stricken with cancer. After Carl's passing in 1998, Philip continued in his role as lead guitarist and vocalist for the Beach Boys until 2001 when he left the band to write and record his own music and pursue other endeavors. Philip's first solo album, \\"In A Perfect World‚Ä¶\\" was released later that year and was met with success and great reviews. It immediately got Philip's music noticed by the likes of radio personalities Mark and Brian of 95.5 KLOS in Los Angeles who invited Philip with his newly formed band, Day After Rain, to play a one-hour set live on-air as the winner of the Mark And Brian Best Unsigned Artist competition. Philip and his band's performance on that show prompted T.V. personality, Wayne Brady to call in and invite the band to appear on the Wayne Brady Show. Philip is also known for his role as lead vocalist in the Frontline Records Christian Rock band, MAGDALEN together with former House Of Lords members Chuck Wright, Lanny Cordola and Ken Mary. He has been a part of many albums in the Contemporary Christian genre appearing on albums for Maranatha Records, Promise Keepers and Reggae Worship volumes 1 and 2 for Frontline Records. Currently, Philip is working on another record for Naples, Italy-based Frontiers Records, where he released his first solo album on the label, In The Cut, in 2005. His most recent work is collaboration with recording artist, Bruce Turgon (Foreigner, Shadowking). Philip continues to write and record music as he serves as worship leader in Southern California.

A multiplex is a movie theater complex with multiple screens within a single complex. They are usually housed in a specially designed building. Sometimes, an existing venue undergoes a renovation where the existing auditoriums are split into smaller ones, or more auditoriums are added in an extension or expansion of the building. The largest of these complexes can sit thousands of people and are sometimes referred to as a megaplex. The difference between a multiplex and a megaplex is related to the number of screens, but the dividing line is not well-defined; some might say that 14 screens and stadium seating make a megaplex; while others might say that at least 20 screens are required.Melnick, Ross & Fuchs, Andrea (2004). Cinema Treasures: A New Look at Classic Movie Theaters. pp. 180‚Äì81. . \\"[T]he new 'megaplex' theater, defined as containing 20 or more screens\\"; \\"Durwood opened the AMC Grand 24 (Dallas) in May 1995\\". Megaplex theaters always have stadium seating, and may have other amenities often not found at smaller movie theaters; multiplex theatres often feature regular seating. The Kinepolis- Madrid Ciudad de la Imagen megaplex in Spain is the largest movie theater in the world, with 25 screens and a seating capacity of 9,200, including one 996-seat auditorium.  History  = Origins = In about 1915 two adjacent theatres in Moncton, New Brunswick, under the same ownership were converted to share a single entrance on Main Street. After patrons entered the door, there were separate ticket booths for each theatre, and different programs were shown. The arrangement was so unusual that it was featured by Robert Ripley in his Believe It or Not! comic strip.Larracey, E. W. (1991). The History of Moncton, Volume 2, Moncton: The City of Moncton, p 127. Before multiplexes, some cinemas did show different films at the same time in one auditorium, such as in Cairo, Egypt, reported in 1926. In 1930, the Regal Twins in Manchester, England became the world's first multiplex followed by Studio 1 and 2 in Oxford Street in London in 1936. In 1937 James Edwards twinned his Alhambra Theater in the Los Angeles area by converting an adjacent storefront into a second \\"annex\\" screen. While both screens would show the same feature movie, one would also offer a double bill. It did not convert to showing different movies on both screens until some time after Nat Taylor (see below). On February 25, 1940, the Patricia Theater in Aiken, South Carolina made news by becoming what is believed to be the first two-screen theater in the United States showing different movies when operator H. Bert Ram added a screen to an adjoining building and shared a common box office. The main screen remained the Patricia Theatre and the Patricia Annex became known as the Little Patricia.\\"Aiken to be 17th City to Show Film (\\"Gone with the Wind\\"); Little Patricia to Open Same Day.\\" Aiken Standard, 14 February 1940, p. 5 and see http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/20886/photos/131821 In December 1947 Nat Taylor, the operator of the Elgin Theatre in Ottawa, Canada, opened a smaller second theater (\\"Little Elgin\\") next door to his first theater. It was not until 1957, however, that Taylor decided to run different movies in each theater, when he became annoyed at having to replace films that were still making money with new releases. Taylor opened dual-screen theaters in 1962 in Place Ville Marie in Montreal, Quebec, and at Yorkdale Plaza in Toronto, Ontario, in 1964. Also in late 1947, but in Havana, Cuba, the Duplex movie theater was built to share the vestibule and ancillary facilities with the previously existing Rex Cinema (open since 1938); they were both designed by the same architect, Luis Bonich. The programming was coordinated, so that one of them showed documentary and news reels. while the other was showing feature films.Melnick, Ross & Andrea Fuchs. Cinema Treasures: A New Look at Classic Movie Theatres. St. Paul: MBI, 2004. Page 147 They were in use at least until the 1990s. In 1963 AMC Theatres opened the two-screen Parkway Twin in Kansas City, a concept which company president Stan Durwood later claimed to have come up with in 1962, realizing he could double the revenue of a single theater \\"by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff\\". Also, the shopping center structure where the Parkway was located could not support a large theater, so two small theaters were built to avoid that issue, and at first both theaters played the same film. In 1965, the first triplex was opened in Burnaby, Canada by Taylor Twentieth Century Theaters. AMC followed up on the Parkway Twin with a four-screen theater in Kansas City, the Metro Plaza, in 1966 and a six-screen theater in 1969. Durwood's insight was that one box office and one concession stand could easily serve two (or more) attached auditoriums. Another AMC innovation was to offset the starting times of films, so that staff members who previously had downtime while films were playing at a single-auditorium theater would now be kept continuously busy servicing other auditoriums. In 1965 Martin's Westgate Cinemas became one of the first indoor two-screen theaters in Atlanta, Georgia. Located in East Point, Georgia, it was later converted into a three- screen venue after a fire partially destroyed one of the theaters. The Disney family film Those Calloways had its world premier at the Westgate, the only film to have been so honored at that theater. = Screen wars = Opening in April 1979, the 18-screen Cineplex, co-founded by Nat Taylor in Toronto's Eaton Centre, became the world's largest multitheatre complex under one roof. It was expanded to 21 screens by at least 1981. In November 1988, Kinepolis Brussels opened with 25 screens, and is often credited as being the first \\"megaplex\\".Acland, Charles R. (2003). Screen Traffic: Movies, Multiplexes, and Global Culture. p. 136. . On December 13, 1996, AMC Ontario Mills 30, a 30-screen theater, opened in Ontario, California, and became the theater with the most screens in the world. This was eventually tied in the late 1990s by other AMC 30-screen theaters. In 1999, a 31-screen multiplex was opened in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to become the largest in the world. = Effects = During a high period of growth in many towns, the competition presented by a multiplex would often put the town's smaller theaters out of business. Multiplexes were often developed in conjunction with big-box stores in power centers or in suburban malls during the 70s and 80s. The expansion was executed at the big-box pace which left many theater companies bankrupt while attempting to compete ‚Äî almost all major movie theater companies went bankrupt during this hasty development process; however, AMC Theatres and Cinemark Theatres did not go into bankruptcy. The early U.S. megaplexes sparked a wave of megaplex building across the United States. This was financed in part by a sale-leaseback model with Entertainment Properties Trust.  Largest cinema complex  Kinepolis Madrid opened in Spain on 17 September 1998; it is the world's largest cinema complex in terms of number of seats and has a total seating capacity of 9,200 with 25 screens, each seating between 211 and 996 people. The world's tallest cinema complex is the Cineworld Glasgow Renfrew Street in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom at 203 feet. Opened in 2001, it has 18 screens and seats 4,300 people.  Around the world  = Australia = Event Cinemas is the largest film exhibitor in Australia and New Zealand. The largest megaplex in the Southern Hemisphere is the 26-screen Marion MEGAPLEX in Adelaide, South Australia. The megaplex was originally a 30-screen megaplex branded as Greater Union but was modified to accommodate Gold Class and V-Max screens and was re-branded as Event Cinemas. The auditoriums sit on top of Westfield Marion, which is the largest shopping complex in Adelaide. = Canada = Canada's largest movie theaters over the years have been located in Toronto. As mentioned above the 18- (later 21-) screen Cineplex was the movie theater with the most screens in the world until the late 1980s, but remained the largest movie theater in Canada until it was closed at the turn of the 21st century. In 1998, AMC expanded to Canada, building large movie theatres with as many as 24 screens before opening a 30-plex there in 1999, which is the AMC Interchange 30. Then in 2008, the 24-screen AMC Yonge Dundas 24, adjacent to the Eaton Centre, was completed. Cineplex Entertainment purchased the theater in 2012, along with several other Canadian AMC megaplexes, bringing the company full circle. After that, some more were closed or sold to Empire Theatres. AMC exited Canada by closing the AMC Interchange 30 in 2014. = France = France's largest movie theaters are: 27-screen UGC Cin√© Cit√© Les Halles (3,913 seats) in Paris, 23-screen Kin√©polis - Ch√¢teau du Cin√©ma in Lomme (7,286 seats), 22-screen UGC Cin√© Cit√© Strasbourg (5,275 seats) and 20-screen MK2 Biblioth√®que in Paris (3,500 seats). = Greece = Greece' s largest multiplex is Village Rentis, that features 18 mainstream screens, two comfort (special type of a mainstream screen, better seating and less auditorium), three RealD 3D screens and one summer screen. In total it features 21 screens. = India = In India, the mushrooming of multiplexes started since the mid-1990s. Cinema chains such as INOX, PVR, Carnival Cinemas, SPI Cinemas, Cinepolis and Big Cinemas operate multiplexes across the country. The largest multiplex in India is the 16-screen megaplex Mayajaal in chennai. = Netherlands = In the Netherlands there weren't many multiplexes until the millennial change. In April 2000 Path√© ArenA opened its doors in the ArenAPoort area in Amsterdam. It's the largest multiplex in the Netherlands and features 14 screens and 3250 seats in total. Nowadays a lot of other multiplexes are being set up, but so far none of them have surpassed Path√© ArenA's capacity. = Spain = Multiplexes (multicines) are very popular in Spain and they can be found in or close to most cities, displacing the traditional single-screen theaters. Many middle- sized and large cities have several of them, and they are also common in malls. The average number of screens per theater was 5.2 in 2016. The Kinepolis-Madrid Ciudad de la Imagen megaplex has been the largest movie theater in the world since 1998, with 25 screens and a seating capacity of 9,200 including a 996-seat auditorium. Kinepolis-Valencia, built in 2001, boasts 24 screens and 8,000 seats. = United Kingdom = As noted above, the world's first multiplex, the Regal Twins, opened in Manchester in 1930. The first triplex in the UK was the ABC Cinema in Lothian Road, Edinburgh which opened 29 November 1969. The Regal Twins were converted in 1972 to a five screen complex (Studios 1 to 5) by Star Group, as the first five-cinema complex in Britain. In 1985, AMC Cinemas opened a ten-screen cinema at The Point in Milton Keynes. This was AMC's first multiplex outside of the United States and saw a turnaround in the decline of the UK cinema industry. The success of the cinema at Milton Keynes led to further expansion by AMC in the UK to Newcastle, Dudley, Telford, Warrington and by royal appointment to London, before it eventually sold its UK division to a joint venture which it had formed with United Artists and Cinema International Corporation, which later became UCI Cinemas in 1989. Non-multiplex cinemas are now rare in the UK. In July 2000, Star City, Birmingham opened with a 30-screen Warner Village Cinemas (now a 25-screen Vue Cinemas with 5,079 seats), at the time the largest cinema in Europe. = United States = Rave Motion Pictures Ann Arbor (now a Cinemark) In the United States, only 10% of the 16,712 indoor movie theaters in 1981 had more than one screen, with 80% of the 10% only having two screens. The largest had 7 screens. In 1982, the 14-screen Cineplex in the Beverly Center Mall in West Hollywood, California, became the country's largest upon opening. The Beverly Center Cinemas closed in June 2010. Cineplex joined with Universal Studios to build an 18-screen multiplex in Universal City, California (now part of Universal CityWalk Hollywood) which opened July 4, 1987. In December 1988, Studio 28 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, expanded from 12 to 20 screens with a seating capacity of 6,000.Jack Loeks' Studio 28 in Grand Rapids, MI. Cinema Treasures. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. Studio 28 closed in November 2008. By 1994, building of multiplexes with 14-24 screens with 2,500 to 3,500 seats was the norm. The expansion of multiplexes also concentrated the market with the top ten exhibitors controlling 47% of the nation's screens compared to 27% in 1986. The AMC Grand 24 opened in Dallas, Texas on May 19, 1995 as the first 24-screen megaplex built from the ground up in the United States and the largest theater complex in the U.S. A 21-screen Edwards Theater opened at the Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, California the same year. After a lease renewal dispute with the property owner, the AMC Grand 24 closed in November 2010. The building has been divided and reopened in 2012 as a Toby Keith‚Äìowned nightclub and a 14-screen first-run movie theater operated by Southern Theatres as the \\"AmStar 14\\". This theatre is now the Studio Movie Grill Northwest Highway . AMC Theatres has since built many megaplexes with up to 30 screens, starting with the AMC Ontario Mills 30 in 1996, which was the largest theater in the world when it opened. Three months after the AMC opened in Ontario, California, Edwards built their biggest theater across the street, the 22-screen Ontario Palace 22. By 2004, only 25% of movie theaters in the United States had one screen and there were over 500 multiplexes with more than 16 screens.

He was one of Ireland's best-selling authors in the 1930s. A new musical based on his novel, Castle Gillian, is currently in development by Victor Kazan (Book & Lyrics), Kevin Purcell (Music) and Mark Buys (Dance Music). Life Maurice Walsh was born on or about 21 April 1879, in the townland of Ballydonoghue, near Listowel, County Kerry, Ireland. He was the third of ten children and the first son born to John Walsh, a local farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Buckley, who lived in a three-roomed thatched farmhouse. His father was politically involved in the National Land League but his main interests were books and horses and he employed others to work the farm. One of these farmhands was called Paddy Bawn Enright, whose name was later used in the short story \\"The Quiet Man\\", although it was changed for the movie version. John Walsh passed on to his son a love of books, as well as Irish legends and folk tales and the theory of place which features in much of his work. Walsh produced some 20 novels, plus a large number of short stories, many set in Scotland or the West of Ireland and containing a mix of drama and romance. Much of his work invoked a rural Ireland that was fast disappearing in the 1930s and while little read today, at the time they proved immensely popular, being translated into Italian, Danish, French, German and Flemish. In 1908, he married Caroline Begg, always referred to by her nickname \\"Toshon\\", who came from Dufftown, Banffshire, in Scotland; they had three sons, Ian, Neil and Maurice, and two daughters, Molly and Elizabeth, both of whom died young. One of his grandsons is Irish painter Manus Walsh. Caroline predeceased him in January 1941; Walsh himself died on February 18, 1964 in Blackrock, Dublin, and was buried in the Esker cemetery at Lucan, County Dublin. The then President of Ireland, √âamon de Valera, attended his funeral Mass. Career Glenfiddich Distillery, Dufftown; while in the Excise Service, Walsh was based in the area to monitor compliance. Walsh went to school in nearby Lisselton, later attending St Michael's College in Listowel to prepare for the Civil Service examination. He entered the Customs and Excise Service in 1901 as an Assistant Revenue Officer and after an initial posting in Limerick, was sent to Scotland; with the exception of 1909-1913 when he was based in Ireland, he spent much of his British service in the Highlands, where his job involved monitoring whisky distilleries in Strathspey. This was where he met Scots novelist Neil Gunn, who also worked in the Excise Service and became a close friend. In 1908, Walsh sold two stories to the Irish Emerald, a Dublin magazine containing a mix of stories by Irish writers with articles on Irish history and language. In 1912, this combined with The Shamrock to form The Shamrock and Irish Emerald before folding in 1919. One of these stories was \\"Eudmon Blake; or, The sack of Athenree\\", which he later used as the basis for his 1932 novel Blackcock's Feather. In 1922, Walsh transferred to the Excise service of the newly-formed Irish Free State and moved to Dublin, where he joined Comhaltas Cana, the Irish customs officers association, and wrote for its journal Irisleabhar. The founding of the Free State split the nationalist movement and led to the 1922-1923 Irish Civil War; as a result, Walsh left his family in Scotland until it was safe for them to join him in 1923. Bridge used in the 1952 film of Walsh's best-known short story, \\"The Quiet Man\\" During this enforced separation, Walsh wrote his first novel, The Key Above the Door, as an entry in a new novel competition. Although it failed to win, it was first serialised in Chambers' Journal, then published as a book in July 1926 by W & R Chambers and ultimately sold over 250,000 copies. Over the next decade, several short stories were printed in The Dublin Magazine, a journal founded in 1925 featuring Irish authors, including Samuel Beckett, and the poet Austin Clarke. From 1930, others were placed in Capuchin Annual, while his book sales grew steadily, especially after an unsolicited letter of praise for The Key Above the Door from J. M. Barrie, author of Peter Pan. Chambers subsequently used this testimonial to promote his other books. In 1932, Walsh published Blackcock's Feather, which was later translated into Irish as Cleite chiarchoiligh for use in schools. He retired from government service the next year to become a full-time writer and shortly after sold his short story, \\"The Quiet Man\\", to The Saturday Evening Post, a US weekly that published F Scott Fitzgerald among others. The story was included in the collection published in 1935 as Green Rushes; several of these were considerably darker than his other work and feature Hugh Forbes, an IRA member during the Irish War of Independence. This character appears in \\"The Small Dark Man\\" and \\"The Prudent Man\\" published in Green Rushes and Son of a Tinker, respectively; the director John Ford gave Forbes a brief cameo in the 1952 film The Quiet Man, although he does not appear in Walsh's story. Walsh became President of the Irish branch of PEN in 1938, visiting the United States that year as the Irish delegate; when World War II began in 1939, his article in defence of Irish neutrality, \\"Ireland in a Warring Europe\\", was published in The Saturday Evening Post. After the war, he published several collections of short stories, the most popular being those featuring Tomasheen James, a figure allegedly based on Paddy Bawn Enright. Several of his works were made into films or plays, most notably the 1952 Oscar-winner The Quiet Man, but also a 1954 film loosely based on Trouble in the Glen; the film was poorly received while the experience allegedly put Walsh off Hollywood for good. A number of other works, including Blackcock's Feather, were serialised on the radio. A musical based on \\"The Quiet Man\\" called Donnybrook was produced in 1960 but flopped; another is currently in development, based on his novel Castle Gillian. Assessment WB Yeats); the apogee of Irish Romantic nationalism Walsh is remembered today primarily for his short story \\"The Quiet Man\\", but in the 1930s and 1940s, he was one of Ireland's best selling authors. His admirers allegedly included Ernest Hemingway, while his historical novels were set in periods and perspectives less well-known today. The 1932 work Blackcock's Feather covers the 1594-1603 Nine Years War, while the 1937 novel And No Quarter follows the 1644-1645 campaigns of Montrose from the perspective of his Irish troops. Sons of the Swordmaker goes back to the first century BCE; it also features common links between Scotland and Ireland, while the second half is a re-working of the Irish saga The Destruction of Da Derga's Hall. Anti-Treaty prisoner during the 1923-1924 Civil War; Walsh's writing emphasised what united the Irish and their neighbours Much of his work was produced in the aftermath of the 1923-1924 Irish Civil War, fought with particular bitterness in his home county of Kerry. This included its most notorious atrocity at Ballyseedy; nine Anti-Treaty prisoners were tied to a landmine, which was then detonated, killing all but one who was miraculously blown clear. Like other Irish writers of his era, such as W. B. Yeats, Walsh was influenced by Romantic nationalism and the ideas of Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744‚Äì1803), who argued nationality was the product of climate, geography and 'more particularly, languages, inclinations and characters.' This meant being Irish was not a function of race, politics or religion but a shared physical and cultural landscape, an idea with enormous appeal in the divided Ireland of the late 1920s and 1930s. This is reflected in Walsh's style which the poet Seamus Heaney described as being \\"an atmosphere, a sense of bogs and woods\\". In his novels, he appeals to the idea of a united Gaeldom and a united Ireland, regardless of nationality or religion; And No Quarter is set within Montrose's combined Scottish-Irish army, while the hero Martin Somers is an Englishman and member of the Protestant Church of Ireland, which in 2016 still had over 126,400 members in Eire.Census 2016 Results. The five stories in Green Rushes that include \\"The Quiet Man\\" share a common theme of IRA members coming to terms with their memories of the fighting. However, it has been argued that after 1922, '....Romantic Nationalism, having served its purpose, became an irrelevance, even an encumbrance, in the troubled future course of Irish history.' Walsh's style and approach fell out of fashion in the 1950s. He is listed in the 1948 publication Catholic Authors: Contemporary Biographical Sketches, 1930-1952, Volume 1 and is also included in the Macmillan Dictionary of Irish Literature.

It consisted of two search radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. In 1982, the system was removed from Long Beach, and was replaced by the AN/SPS-48 during a comprehensive overhaul.Milestones in USS Long Beach History Aboard the Long Beach, the system used AN/SPG-55 radars for missile guidance. Despite its failure to enter widespread service, the lessons learned were applied to the follow-on Aegis Combat System and the associated AN/SPY-1 passive electronically scanned array (PESA) radar. History Prior to the development of SCANFAR, the Navy had been developing an advanced anti-aircraft weapon system combining an extremely advanced radar system, the AN/SPG-59, with a new long-range missile known as the RIM-50 Typhon. The radar was an active electronically scanned array that acted both as a long-range surveillance system as well as the target illumination and guidance system for the missiles. The system proved to be beyond the state of the art, in particular it required a large number of individual broadcast elements that proved to be unreliable and expensive. SCANFAR was to some extent a simplified version of the SPG-59. The main radar would be used solely for surveillance, with target illumination being left to existing radar systems used with earlier missiles like the RIM-8 Talos or RIM-24 Tartar. During development it was found that attempting to use a single antenna for both search and tracking did not work effectively, so the system was modified to use two antennas, one for surveillance and another for tracking. Thus the system ended up using three radar antennas, and was, therefore, similar to earlier systems. An automatic tracking computer was added to the system in 1967. Also, in 1967, USS Long Beach detected and destroyed two North Vietnamese MiGs, utilizing the SCANFAR and Talos missile systems. In service, the system proved to be temperamental, due largely to the huge number of vacuum tubes it used. Despite this, the \\"air picture\\" it provided was good, with over-the-horizon capabilities. In 1967, during a shipyard overhaul period, the Long Beach radar system was converted from electronic tubes to solid state electronic boards. Converting to solid state for radar and radio equipment lightened the superstructure by 20 tons. AN/SPS-33 was an S band radar with a pencil beam function that could focus a single radar beam on a target. The pencil beam could be manually operated. SCANFAR was eventually replaced by the AN/SPS-48E. *AN/SPS-32 was a horizontally wide rectangular antenna for air surveillance. *AN/SPS-33 was a vertical narrow rectangular antenna for target tracking. According to Navy documentation, the AN/SPS-33 was frequency-scanned in elevation and phase-scanned in azimuth. References ;Notes ;Online *Dranidis, Dimitris V. Shipboard Phased-Array Radars.

For 33 years he was a play-by-play announcer for Major League Baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates, the longest such tenure in the team's history. In 2008, he was nominated for the Ford Frick Award, which is given by the Baseball Hall of Fame for broadcasting excellence. Frattare attended Ithaca College, graduating in 1970. He started his career in his home town as a radio disk jockey at the city's top rated station, WBBF (AM). During his time in Rochester radio he expanded his on-air role to include work as a sportscaster and lead play-by-play broadcaster for the American Hockey League's Rochester Americans. As the radio broadcaster for the Pirates' AAA affiliate Charleston Charlies in 1974 and 1975, Frattare was mentored by hall of fame Pirates broadcaster Bob Prince, who invited Frattare to Pittsburgh after the Charlies' seasons concluded and allowed Frattare to take over the microphone on occasion. He moved to Pittsburgh and joined the Pirates major league broadcasting crew on radio (KDKA) and cable television in 1976. He started as Milo Hamilton's junior partner, calling just two innings of most games and serving as Hamilton's color man. His role began to increase after Hamilton left following the 1979 season. The Pirates gave Frattare a new contract late in the 2006 season that was to keep him on the air through 2009. In August 2008, Frattare announced his 5000th Pirates game. He began sharing primary announcing duties with Greg Brown, as the Pirates evolved toward a transition that will come with Frattare's retirement. On October 1, 2008, Frattare announced he was retiring from the Pirate broadcast booth and would not return for the 2009 season. Frattare was lead announcer on the ESPN broadcast of the February 23, 1985 college basketball game between Indiana University and Purdue University during which Indiana coach Bob Knight threw a chair across the court, a moment which is frequently replayed on television to this day. Frattare has two children and two grandchildren from his first marriage. He remarried a few years ago to the former choir director of Upper St. Clair High School, but the couple separated in late 2007. Over the past twenty years, he has hosted the Family Links Golf Classic which has raised over $1.6 million in support of mentally challenged individuals and their families. As of March 18, 2009, Frattare joined Waynesburg University as an assistant professor in Communications in the Department of Communication and the faculty adviser of University radio station WCYJ-FM, while also doing some work with University Relations. In 2010, he hosted the inaugural Sports Announcing Camp at Waynesburg University, featuring a week of programs and instruction for high school students interested in broadcasting. Frattare is also a broadcaster with the TribLive High School Sports Network, providing play-by-play coverage and color commentary for WPIAL high school sporting events.

After having been in the band for 14 years, Idan announced his departure in summer of 2008 stating an urge for more creativity and his desire to become a lead guitarist again. In 2008 he released his debut solo album The Folly on which he plays all the instruments with exception of a string quartet. In the same year he formed his own outfit 'The John Idan Group'. He has since been recording for his 2nd album and worked on various musical projects playing in the UK, Europe and the USA. In 2015, Idan rejoined The Yardbirds, now as rhythm guitarist. He has also recently been playing guitar and singing with Ric Lee's Natural Born Swingers, a band led by Ric Lee of Ten Years After. Idan also taught music to pupils at Eastwick Junior School in Bookham, Surrey in the late 2000s whilst also fulfilling daytime bookings in over-60s venues such as care and nursing homes, day centres and friendship clubs, where activity organisers staff seniors and their visitors reviewed him well.

It contains whole as well as ground soybeans.  Production  It can be made in 2 to 3 days through fermentation of boiled soybeans, adding Bacillus subtilis, which is usually contained in the air or in the rice straw, at about 40¬∞C without adding salt, compared with the much longer fermentation period required for doenjang, another, less pungent variety of Korean soybean paste. Like many forms of doenjang, cheonggukjang is paste-like in texture, but also includes some whole, uncrushed soybeans. Cheonggukjang may also be made by fermenting boiled soybeans in a warm place, pounding a portion of them, and adding salt and red chili powder.  History  Cheonggukjang was introduced by what is now China to the Korean peninsula during the Joseon era. At the time, cheonggukjang was used as rations by Qing Dynasty soldiers. Cheonggukjang is most often used to prepare a stew, which is also simply called cheonggukjang, but may be called cheonggukjang jjigae to avoid confusion.photo Cheonggukjang jjigae often includes additional ingredients, such as potatoes, onions, and tofu.  Nutrition and health  Cheonggukjang is generally considered to be a healthy food (particularly in the winter), as it is rich in vitamins and other nutrients, though its very strong odor is not universally enjoyed. Some people have commented that this soup gives off the aroma of wet socks. Doenjang may be used to replace it by people who dislike the smell. In 1993, odorless cheonggukjang was invented by Dr. Hyun Kyu Joo, a former professor at Kunkook University, who later obtained a patent in 1998 for a method for removing cheonggukjang's characteristic smell. Cheonggukjang is also believed to aid in digestion. For this purpose, cheonggukjang pills are produced in South Korea.

It is the second book in his Dahak trilogy (after Mutineers' Moon, and before Heirs of Empire). Thematically, it forms a duology with Mutineers' Moon; the latter dealt with the suppression of Anu's mutiny as part of the groundwork for repelling the Achuultani assault, whilst Heirs of Empire is more of a stand-alone bildungsroman work concerning survival on a remote planet. In 2003, it was republished in the omnibus volume Empire from the Ashes.  Plot summary  = Book 1 = After the events of Mutineers' Moon, the evil mutineer Anu has been defeated by the warship Dahak, aided by its new captain, Colin MacIntyre. As the highest-ranking officer of the Imperium present, MacIntyre had elevated himself to the rank of \\"Governor of Earth\\" in order to absolve the loyalist mutineers of their crimes; he then unified the worlds' governments under his authority (backed up by his advanced Imperial armaments and Dahak) and set Horus the task of preparing defenses against the Achuultani scouts, which have been methodically advancing on the Sol system, detected by self-destructing Imperial sensor arrays. This gave frantic defenders under Lieutenant Governor Horus and his assistant, Gerald Hatcher, barely two years to pacify the holdouts to the new world order (such as the Asian Alliance), to modernize the world economy, construct and power a planetary defense shield, as well as construct and train a space fleet and the fortresses on the ground which will support the fleet; and then of course to defeat both the scouts and the main Achuultani incursion. The primary holdout to participation in the planetary defense plan was the Asian Alliance, a group of all Asian nations except Japan and the Philippines. It was effectively controlled by a Marshal Tsien Tao- ling. who is convinced to join by the obvious military imbalance (the moon having disappeared, and several Middle Eastern nations forcibly disarmed by Imperium technology-equipped troops) and by the promise of considerable local autonomy and control of four seats on the nine-person council advising Horus. Regardless, the military programs soon get underway. To withstand the Siege (as the coming attack on Earth has come to be called) the Earth's defenses consists of front line spaceships, constructed by \\"orbital industrial units\\" left behind by Dahak (clanking replicators, in other words); a planetary shield powered by a core tap;\\"It was Dahaks core tap, a tremendous, immaterial funnel that reached deep into hyper space, connecting the ship to a dimension of vastly higher energy levels. It dragged that limitless power in, focused and refined it, and directed it into the megaton mass of his Enchanach Drive.\\" Pages 42 to 43. and all backed up by numerous hypermissile launchers built into \\"Planetary Defense Centers\\" (sheared off and embedded with armaments mountains around the Earth). In the meantime, Colin and his new wife, Jiltanith (daughter of Horus), take Dahak and depart for the nearest known Imperial system to seek military aid from the Imperium; little is expected to come of this quest, as Dahak had been attempting to contact the Imperium via his FTL \\"hypercom\\", but failing completely.\\"The Imperium proper lay far beyond that, yet despite the distances and the threat sweeping steadily towards his [Colin's] homeworld, they'd had no choice but to come, for only the Imperium might offer the aid they desperately needed to save that homeworld from those oncoming starships....But Dahak had been unable to communicate with the Imperium for over fifty thousand years. What if there no longer was an Imperium?\\" From page 14 of the Baen Books 1st paperback edition. The first system they arrive at, the Sheskar system, is devoid of life, its inhabited planet shattered to pieces in what apparently was a civil war using gravity warping implosive \\"gravitonic warheads\\". Even worse, the system had not been reclaimed by the Imperium as it should have (due to its strategically vital location). Reluctantly, they proceed to Defram, where they find merely two barren orbs. Their next visit the planet Keerah in the Kano system; they reason that Defram was simply a Fleet base, and so perhaps a civilian system would have more answers or life. In Keerah, they are attacked by an automated quarantine orbital system; after disabling it, Colin and his crew discover that the dead planet had fallen victim to a horrific biological warfare agent designed to be effective against all forms of life (by rapidly mutating until a successfully lethal form is obtained), which spread throughout the entire Empire (the form of government having changed in the ensuing thousands of years) too quickly to be contained, thanks to widespread use of a teleportation (or \\"mat-trans\\" as it was known) device. Colin makes the fateful decision to go straight to the Bia system and the planet Birhat- the military and political centers of the Empire. This decision means that it would be impossible for them to return to Earth in time to help defeat the scouts. At Birhat, they discover an enormous number of installations in the system, such as a shield which protects not merely the planet of Birhat, but the entire inner system. After successfully picking his way through a labyrinth of emergency programming protecting \\"Mother\\" (the master computer overseeing the Fleet and the Bia system), Colin resorts to ordering Mother to implement \\"Case Omega\\"- an order which, unbeknownst to him, appoints the senior surviving Fleet official and civil servant as Emperor. This unexpected elevation has the happy side effect of granting Colin control of the Imperial Guard Flotilla: 78 planetoids, each vastly more powerful than Dahak (but also vastly stupider). The crew of Dahak immediately set to work reactivating and repairing the planetoids so they can return to Earth. = Book 2 = Book 2 begins with a different point of view; the subject is now a minor Achuultani tactical officer named Brashieel, attached to the scout forces about to drop out of hyperspace and destroy Earth. However, the Achuultani warships are extremely slow in hyperspace, and the Earth defenders use their several hours of advance notice to prepare an ambush in the outer system. The ambush, while successful (because of the element of surprise and the generally superior Imperial technology), nevertheless sets the tone for the rest of the Siege by being extremely bloody on both sides. During the months that Colin's crew in Birhat labor to get the Imperial Guard up and running, the scouts duel the Earth forces, hurling asteroid after asteroid at the shield while whittling down the fortresses and ships, all in preparation for their final blow: hurling the entire moon of Iapetus down the gravity well of Sol at high speed, and aimed directly at Earth. Seven months after the first battle, the \\"Hoof\\" (as the Achuultani term their immense kinetic weapon) is about to impact Earth, piercing through the weakened defenders \\"like a bullet through butter\\". At the last moment, the Imperial Guard arrives and as they drop out of hyperspace, blasts the Achuultani escort and the moon into dust using gargantuan gravitonic warheads. Unfortunately, all is not well. Dahak recovers from some wreckage computer records about the main Achuultani force: some 3 million vessels more powerful than the scouting vessels, intended to back up the various scout forces. Somewhat fortunately, this invincible force has divided up into at least two fleets, and so Colin develops a plan to exploit the Enchanach Drive's somewhat awkward side effect of accidentally causing stars to go nova (due to the gravitonic shear stress of drive activation too near a star). With the Imperial Guard, they lay an ambush for the first fleet, having intercepted its courier, and lure it into an otherwise unremarkable star system. There they briefly engage the Achuultani (to ensure they are sucked far enough into the system, past the hyperlimit that they cannot escape, and to gather some more military information); the opposing fleet's having stepped into Colin's \\"mousetrap\\", the Enchanach Drives of 8 planetoids simultaneously activate, inducing a supernova which obliterates Sorkar's forces. The second trap does not go as well. Like in the first, the Guard ambushes the second force (this time laying a dense field of hypermines, which account for a quarter of the million Achuultani vessels), but some of Sorkar's couriers had escaped and warned Hothan's fleet of the nova trap, so that stratagem was unusable. Instead, Colin traps Hothan's forces in normal space (again, using the Enchanach Drive's side effect to exploit the hyperdrive's limitation of being unable to work in a sufficiently deep gravity well). With a good deal of luck and a well-timed planetoid assault on the flank, the Achuultani command structure disintegrates and they are routed. Once again, Colin's forces are elated by their success and what they believe to be a crushing victory ending the Achuultani \\"Great Visit\\", and once again Dahak discovers ominous news in the wreckage of the Achuultani command ship: the final segment of 200,000 vessels much more capable than the previous ones, had been held in reserve, and would shortly attack Earth (they having deduced its location from the timing of Colin's attacks) if the Guard did not stop them. The odds are against their depleted, battered ships lacking fresh supplies of hypermines, but they have little choice. The battle goes poorly, and they win thanks only to a suicide plunge by Dahak, in which Dahak hacks into and kills the computer truly in charge of the Great Visit. This is so effective because it had been previously discovered that the explanation for the various Achuultani anomalies (their lack of females, the oddly inconsistent state and stasis of their technology, their constant war making and hyper-xenophobia etc.) was that their civilization had been greatly distorted many millions of years ago, and they had entrusted the survival of their species to a computer roughly the equal of Dahak. That computer turned out to have the personality flaw of ambition, and deliberately perpetuated the state of war it needed to justify to its programming its continued tyrannical control. With the death of Dahak and BattleComp, the Achuultani fleet panics, flees, and is destroyed or captured. As it turns out, Dahak had successfully copied himself to another planetoid, and so survived in essence. And a message from Earth, explaining that Isis Tudor had decoded enough of the Achuultani genetic structure for an eventual prospect of cloning a female Achuultani ‚Äî the first free female for millions of years. Against this hopeful note and the prospect of a war of liberation to free the rest of the Achuultani from the control of the master computer, the novel ends.

The unincorporated areas include Botines, La Presa, Larga Vista, Ranchitos Las Lomas, and Ranchos Penitas West. In 2009, the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" under the accountability ratings system used by the Texas Education Agency.  History  Laredo The district was created in 1961 via the consolidation of the former Cactus, Johnson, and Nye school districts. The \\"Big Three\\" involved in the establishment of UISD were rancher Joe B. Finley, Amparo Gutierrez, and John W. Arndt, all of whom have schools named in their honor. By the 2000s, United ISD had a rapidly growing student population due to the burgeoning populations of many colonias along the Texas- Mexico border. As of the 2000s, United ISD gains about 1,500 students per year. On November 5, 2013, voters handily approved a $408.7 million school bond issue to acquire land, construct new schools, and expand other facilities.

Their tail code is \\"AJ\\" and their radio callsign is Warhawk. The squadron was originally established as Attack Squadron 97 (VA-97) on 1 June 1967 and redesignated VFA-97 on 24 January 1991.  Squadron insignia and nickname  The original VA-97 squadron insignia was approved by the Chief of Naval Operations on 6 March 1968 and they have been called the Warhawks since establishment. According to the US Navy History and Heritage Command, \\"The squadron continued to use its old insignia approved for VA-97. The squadron did not request a designation change to its banner following its redesignation to VFA-97.\\" However, newer VFA-97 insignia appears to be in use.  History  VA-97 insignia approved in 1968 = 1960s = VA-97 was established on 1 June 1967 and assigned to Carrier Air Wing 14 (CVW 14). On 28 May 1968, they departed San Diego embarked on for the squadron's first WESTPAC deployment. On 28 June 1968 the squadron conducted its first combat missions, flying the A-7A Corsair II, against targets in Vietnam. A-7A over the Gulf on Tonkin in 1968 = 1970s = On 4 February 1971, the squadron embarked on at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia for her transit around South America to her new home port of Alameda, California. The squadron's third deployment began in June 1971, embarked on USS Enterprise. In December of that year following the outbreak of the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, USS Enterprise was ordered to leave Yankee Station for the Indian Ocean. The carrier, with VA-97 embarked, operated in the Bay of Bengal until the cessation of hostilities in the latter part of December. After returning to Alameda and a short turn-around period, the squadron again returned to WESTPAC in September 1972, there they participated in Operation Linebacker and Operation Linebacker II in October and December, respectively. In April 1975, the squadron participated in Operation Frequent Wind and provided air support for the evacuation of American and Vietnamese personnel during the Fall of Saigon. In March 1976, VA-97 achieved the \\"Triple Crown\\" of Naval Aviation awards, earning the Wade McClusky Award as the U.S. Navy's top Attack Squadron, the CNO Aviation Safety Award (also known as the Safety \\"S‚Äù), and the Pacific Fleet Battle Efficiency Award (also known as the Battle \\"E\\"). The squadron began their sixth deployment in July 1976 once again embarked on Enterprise with CVW-14. The squadron's return to NAS Lemoore in May 1977 marked the completion of five years and over 25,000 hours of mishap- free flying in the A-7, making VA-97 the first squadron to achieve that mark. Their seventh deployment began in April 1978 aboard Enterprise. In May of that year the squadron surpassed six years and over 30,000 hours of mishap-free flying. The eighth deployment began in November 1979, embarked on , with most of the deployment spent on \\"Gonzo Station\\" off the southern coast of Iran. = 1980s = VA-97 A-7E on during Operation Eagle Claw in April 1980 In April 1980 while embarked on USS Coral Sea, VA-97 was part of the task force involved in supporting Operation Eagle Claw, the Iranian hostage rescue attempt. Coral Sea was the squadron's home for deployment nine in August 1981, and again for deployment ten in March 1983, when they sailed around the world. The squadron's eleventh deployment departed NAS Alameda in October 1984 on , then the U.S. Navy's newest carrier. The squadron participated in FLEETEX 85, involving five carrier battle groups and sixty-five ships from various countries. The 12th deployment began in August 1986 operating from USS Carl Vinson above the Aleutian Islands Chain in the Bering Sea, both on the way to WESTPAC and on the return trip. The squadron returned home in February 1987. The 13th deployment began in June 1988 and included support of Operation Earnest Will convoys in the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz. In July 1988 during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, USS Carl Vinson operated off the coast of Korea. The deployment ended with the squadron winning the Battle Efficiency Award. In 1989, the squadron earned the LTJG Bruce Carrier Memorial Award for Maintenance Excellence and the Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety \\"S\\" award. = 1990s = Throughout the 1990s, the squadron supported United Nations coalition forces by participating in Operation Southern Watch in Iraq. They also flew in support of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. In 1990 the squadron completed their 15th and last WESTPAC deployment in the A-7 Corsair. On 24 January 1991, VA-97 was redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 97 (VFA-97) and transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet. That summer, the squadron flew to NAS Norfolk and embarked for her transit around Cape Horn. VFA-97 F/A-18 Hornet In late 1992, the squadron deployed to the WESTPAC in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) over Iraq as well as Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. The squadron returned to NAS Lemoore in May 1993. In June 1994, the squadron began their 17th cruise. This was their last cruise as a member of CVW 15. In October 1995 the squadron joined Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11) aboard Kitty Hawk, deploying in support of OSW. The squadron was awarded the 1996 Battle \\"E\\", the LTJG Bruce Carrier Award for maintenance excellence, and the Scott Kirby Award for ordnance excellence. In December 1997 Carrier Air Wing 11 and the squadron were assigned to USS Carl Vinson, deploying on November 10, 1998 for WESTPAC 98‚Äì99, their 19th deployment. The squadron flew combat missions supporting Operation Desert Fox and OSW, returning to NAS Lemoore in May 1999. = 2000s = VFA-97 F/A-18E makes touch-and-go landing on in July 2016. The squadron deployed in late July 2001 aboard Carl Vinson. After the September 11 attacks, the carrier and her air wing rushed to the North Arabian Sea and conducted sustained combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The squadron completed over 3,000 flight hours, 1,340 sorties, and a 99 percent combat sortie completion rate, delivering over 453,000 pounds of ordnance in a ten-week period in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. After returning to Lemoore, their efforts were recognized with the 2001 Battle \\"E\\", the 2001 Captain Michael J. Estocin Award and the Chief of Naval Operations Safety \\"S‚Äù, resulting in the so-called \\"triple-crown\\" achievement for the Warhawks. In 2003, the squadron, attached to CVW-11, embarked on and flew hundreds of combat sorties in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This marked the final time the F-18A's would be used in combat. (The Blue Angels still fly this older model). After return from deployment, the squadron transitioned from the F/A-18A to the F/A-18C and began preparation for their upcoming Unit Deployment Program (UDP) deployment. In 2004, VFA-97 was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 12 as the first Navy squadron to take part in the UDP deploying to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. The squadron deployed to MCAS Iwakuni again in 2006 for their second UDP deployment, and again in January 2008 for their third UDP and 24th overall deployment. The squadron rejoined CVW-11 and Nimitz on return from Iwakuni and began a compressed turnaround for deployment on board Nimitz. In February 2009, VFA-97 embarked on the Nimitz, officially ending their 5-year departure from a Carrier Air Wing. In July 2009 they departed for an 8-month deployment aboard Nimitz. In late 2013 VFA-97 started transitioning to the F/A-18E Super Hornet and as of 2015 was operational. In 2019, the Warhawks returned to NAS Lemoore from an around the world deployment that included operations in 3rd Fleet, 7th Fleet, 5th Fleet, 6th Fleet and 2nd Fleet. Team Warhawk supported combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq/Syria as part of Operations Freedom Sentinel / Resolute Support and Inherent Resolve / Deliberate Resolve. As of July 1, the squadron was temporarily assigned duties as an aggressor squadron and remained with CVW-9. In September 2019, it was announced the Warhawks have been selected as the next squadron to transition to the F-35C Lightning II in early 2021.https://theaviationgeekclub.com/vfa-97-will-be-the-first- f-a-18-super-hornet-squadron-to-transition-to-the-f-35c/ In December 2019, the Warhawks were reassigned to Carrier Air Wing 8 and the USS Gerald R. Ford, opening a slot in CVW-9.http://www.gonavy.jp/AIRLANTf.html  Awards  VFA-97 has won the Wade McClusky Award, three Safety ‚ÄúS‚Äù awards, two LTJG Bruce Carrier Memorial Awards for Maintenance Excellence, two Scott Kirby Awards for ordnance excellence, and two Captain Michael J. Estocin Awards, twice achieving the ‚ÄúTriple Crown‚Äù. Additionally, VFA-97 earned a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, three Navy Unit Commendations, eight Meritorious Unit Commendations, six Battle ‚ÄúE‚Äù awards, two Navy Expeditionary Service Medals, three National Defense Service Medals, two Armed Forces Terrorism Service and Expeditionary Medals, Humanitarian Service Medal and 24 Sea Service Deployment Ribbons.

At the , Poowong had a population of 360. It is from Melbourne and about north-west of Korumburra. History The first application for land in the Parish of Poowong was made on 17 April 1874 by James Scott for 320 acres of allotment 5, the selection made on behalf on his son Robert Scott.Hartnell, Ross (1974), Packtracks to Pastures: a history of Poowong district, Kurumburra, Poowong Centenary Committee, p.12. Four more selectors pegged out allotments within the next twelve months. On part of the Scott land a store, pub and butcher's shop were built. The Poowong Hotel was built by 1880 but it was destroyed by fire in 1883.White, Joseph (1999), Poowong, the first 30 years, Poowong, Poowong Historical Group, p.17 & 260 A Post Office opened around January 1878. The first survey of townships allotments took place in 1879.Hartnell, p.76 The heavily timbered and hilly nature of the area meant selectors took years to clear enough of their land to make a living from their selections. Facilities For a town of its size, Poowong is quite well off with regard to its facilities. These include four tennis courts, two netball courts, an indoor basketball and squash stadium, a primary school, large community hall, outdoor swimming pool, a number of churches and an Australian rules football oval. The town has an Australian Rules football team and a netball team competing in the Ellinbank & District Football League and the Ellinbank & District Netball Association respectively.  Community projects  The Poowong community is active, with many projects being undertaken by various community groups. The largest group, by far, is the Poowong Football & Netball Club who involve themselves not only in sporting projects, but also in projects helping the wider community. One such project is the 'My Connected Community' project which was being run by the Poowong Football Club in a partnership with the Strzelecki Lions Club, and was designed to increase Internet use amongst community members.

It served in the Eastern Theater in a number of campaigns and battles, but perhaps is most noted for its actions in helping secure Cemetery Hill during the Battle of Gettysburg. Three-months regiment With the outbreak of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to help put down the rebellion. Ohioans responded well, and several new regiments were enrolled for a term of three months, thought to be long enough to end the war. The 4th Ohio Infantry Regiment was organized April 25, 1861, at Camp Jackson in Columbus, with Lorin Andrews as its colonel. The regiment moved to newly constructed Camp Dennison near Cincinnati on May 2, and served on garrison duty there until June 4, at which time, many of the men joined the newly reorganized a three-years regiment with the same numerical designation. Those three months men who elected not to join the three-years regiment were mustered out on July 24, 1861. Among the enlistees in Company I were future U.S. Congressmen Archibald Lybrand and James S. Robinson. Three-years regiment =Early service= The three- years 4th Ohio Infantry was organized at Camp Dennison on June 4, 1861. After a few days of training and drilling, it moved to Grafton, Virginia (now West Virginia) on June 20‚Äì23, where it was attached to Alexander M. McCook's Advance Brigade, West Virginia, until July. As part of the 3rd Brigade, Army of Occupation, the regiment saw action in the West Virginia Campaign, capturing the Confederate-held town of Beverly on July 12. They remained on duty in western Virginia through the balance of the year, fighting in several small skirmishes and battles. In January 1862, the regiment became a part of the 2nd Brigade, Lander's Division, Army of the Potomac until March 1862, when they were reorganized into the 1st Brigade, Shields' 2nd Division, Banks' V Corps in the Department of the Shenandoah. The brigade saw considerable action at the Battle of Kernstown on March 23, then advanced up the valley for the next few weeks, fighting again at the Battle of Port Republic on June 9 before heading to Alexandria, Virginia to rejoin the Army of the Potomac. Brigaded with the 7th West Virginia, 14th Indiana, and 8th Ohio Infantry under Nathan Kimball in the II Corps, the regiment was briefly stationed in Fort Monroe before covering John Pope's retreat from the Second Battle of Bull Run on September 1. Although the regiment was forced to miss the subsequent Maryland Campaign due to regiment-wide sickness, Kimball's Brigade attacked Confederate positions at the Sunken Road at Antietam and suffered serious losses in a prolonged firefight, earning the nickname \\"Gibraltar Brigade.\\" They marched to Harpers Ferry after Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia withdrew from Maryland, staying there until October 30, when the brigade marched towards Falmouth, Virginia. The regiment fought at the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg in December; among the losses was their wounded Colonel James H. Godman. Then it was part of the infamous January \\"Mud March,\\" one of Ambrose Burnside's follies as the commanding general of the Army of the Potomac. The 4th Ohio next saw action during the Battle of Chancellorsville under new brigade commander Samuel \\"Red\\" Carroll. =Gettysburg and 1863 actions= After spending over a month in camp after the disaster at Chancellorsville, the regiment broke camp on June 11 and marched northward to Maryland, arriving in southern Pennsylvania on July 1 well after the start of the Battle of Gettysburg. They were assigned a position along Cemetery Ridge. Much of July 2 was spent holding this position in reserve. The 8th Ohio Infantry Regiment was detached from the brigade and sent forward along the Emmitsburg Road, while the 4th Ohio Infantry and the Indiana and West Virginia regiments were later rushed up the western slope of Cemetery Hill in the gathering darkness. They arrived in time to help repulse the Louisiana Tigers of Harry Hays, who had seized several Union artillery pieces. They briefly pursued Lee into Virginia before being ordered to board ships for transport to New York City to help quell the New York Draft Riots from August 15 until September 16. Returning to Virginia, they participated in the Bristoe and Mine Run Campaigns, but saw little combat. =1864 and 1865 actions= The 4th Ohio did not see significant combat until the Overland Campaign, fighting at the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House in May. After a series of smaller engagements, the 4th was a part of an ill-advised charge against Confederate entrenchments at the futile Battle of Cold Harbor in June. They participated in the Siege of Petersburg from June 16, 1864, to April 2, 1865. The old members of the regiment (the remainder of the original three-years men) mustered out June 21, 1864, and what was left of the 4th Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry was consolidated to a battalion five days later. The much depleted 4th saw action in a series of engagements near Petersburg, including Deep Bottom, Ream's Station, and Hatcher's Run. They served in the Appomattox Campaign from March 28 ‚Äì April 9, seeing their final major combat in the triumph at the Battle of Sayler's Creek. The victorious army marched to Washington, D.C. in early May, then participated in the Grand Review on May 23. The 4th Ohio mustered out July 12, 1865, in Columbus. During its service, the regiment lost 8 officers and 95 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded and 3 officers and 155 enlisted men by disease, a total of 261 fatalities. The 4th Ohio Infantry is memorialized with monuments at Antietam and Gettysburg, as well as an inscription at the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Cleveland's Public Square. Its battle flags are in the collection of the Ohio Historical Society in Cleveland, and some artifacts and records in the Western Reserve Historical Society. Another regiment (unrelated) known as the 4th Ohio served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. It was also known as the 14th Ohio National Guard.

The Oregon Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 opened Oregon Territory to European- American settlement; Washington Territory had a similar law. The law sunset 1 December 1855; settlers had to file their land claims by that date, so White leaders had incentive to get treaties signed with Native Americans as speedily as possible to enable development by whites. Under the laws encouraging settlement, each male settler could homestead and receive free for himself and 640 acres with his wife (women could not individually hold property). Settlers arriving before 1850 could receive , or 1 Regular Section, one square mile. Claims were made by unilateral occupation, implicitly backed by militia if not military. Native Americans were disconcerted by the encroachment of the settlers on their territory, and sometimes reacted by making raids or forming uprisings against them. By and large, Native leaders were willing to sell their land (although they had utterly different conceptions of land use and no cultural comprehension of European-American property rights concepts). They rejected proposals for their relocation from Puget Sound country.(1) Furtwangler (1997), pp. 6-9, 110-111, 162 (2) Donaldson pp. 295-296 in Ibid, p. 110 The courts have said that the power of Congress in Indian affairs is plenary (full and complete)--great but under present law not absolute. The federal government and tribes are co-equal sovereign entities; the tribal governments predated the existence of the United States. One of the basic principles underlying Indian nations is that they \\"retain all the inherent powers of any sovereign nation\\", retaining all original sovereign rights and powers \\"which have not been given up or taken away by due process\\" of law. Courts have ruled that the \\"intent of Congress to limit the sovereign powers of Indian governments by legislation must be clearly expressed in the law in order to be effective\\" (in legal terminology, per Saito, Georgia State University College of Law). [Emphasis added.]Saito The U.S. Constitution, Article 6, states: > This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in > persuance thereof; and _all treaties_ made, or which shall be made, under > the authority of the United States, _shall be the supreme law of the land_ ; > and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the > Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. [Emphasis > added.] Particularly since the rise of Native American activism in the late twentieth century, there have been new legal challenges to numerous treaties, land settlements, and terms of treaties. The Supreme Court has ruled that there are \\"canons of construction\\" for interpreting treaties; of the two principal canons, one is that they are to be interpreted as they would have been understood by the signatories. The Supreme Court has ruled that \\"Treaties are to be construed as a grant of rights from the Indians, not to them--and a reservation of those not granted.\\" (This principle has guided, for instance, the retention of Native Americans of traditional rights to fish and hunt on land ceded to the government, unless those rights were specifically restricted. A treaty broken is not rescinded. Only a following treaty or agreement can relieve signatories of the original treaty. \\"Treaties are as old and as venerable as the Constitution of the United States. Age does not impair their validity or legality.\\" [Deloria, 1994]Deloria in Davis (1994), pp. 645-9 Indian tribes, for the most part, were not parties to and rarely agreed with the diminution in their sovereign powers by the alien tradition of European law. With significant justification, they have often claimed, in cases since the late twentieth century, to retain greater sovereign powers than federal Indian law is prepared to concede. The resulting political dynamic has resulted in tensions and disputes among tribal, federal, and state governments about sovereign powers and jurisdiction denied to tribes by the colonial justifications underlying federal law, which tribes and members point out they never voluntarily surrendered.Clinton in Davis (1994), pp. 645-9 Diminution of sovereignty is usually absent from accession of lands. Governor Stevens and the U.S. government thumb Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens frequently made oral promises to tribal representatives that were not matched by what his office put in writing. As oral cultures, the Native tribes took him at his word. Stevens approved treaties which Judge James Wickerson would characterize forty years later as \\"unfair, unjust, ungenerous, and illegal\\". The local natives had a 30-year history of dealing with the \\"King George's men\\" of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), who had developed a reputation for driving a hard bargain, but sticking honestly to what they agreed to, and for treating Whites and Indians impartially. This continued through the dealings of the local Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Superintendent General, Joel Palmer. Together with Indian Agent Mike Simmons (David 'Doc' Maynard's brother-in- law), he was described as among the few even-handed men in the BIA.(1) Speidel (1967), (1978) (2) Morgan (1951, 1982), pp. 39-51 They were not prepared for the less straightforward approach of Stevens and his staff. The Washington Territory treaties, such as the Treaty of Medicine Creek (1854) and this Treaty of Point Elliott of 1855 (22 January) were followed by the Treaty of Walla Walla of 1855. Governor Stevens ignored federal government instructions to stick to sorting out the areas where natives and settlers were immediately adjacent to one another or where settlers moved in on Native places, and tried to settle Native issues for the territory. Natives were angered by his pushing in other areas. Their concept of war had more to do with resources and complex concepts of prestige than with conquest or annihilation, which were not even considered.(1) Morgan (1951, 1982) (2) Speidel (1978) (3) Holm in Hoxie Historian Morgan suggested that Stevens appointed certain chiefs of tribes in order to facilitate goals of his administration.Morgan (1951, 1982), pp. 20-54 \\"The salient features of the policy outlined [by Governor Stevens to his advisers] were as follows: :1. To concentrate the Indians upon a few reservations, and encourage them to cultivate the soil and adopt settled and civilized habits. :2. To pay for their lands not in money, but in annuities of blankets, clothing, and useful articles during a long term of years. :3. To furnish them with schools, teachers, farmers and farming implements, blacksmiths, and carpenter, with shops of those trades. :4. To prohibit wars and disputes among them. :5. To abolish slavery. :6. To stop as far as possible the use of liquor. :7. As the change from savage to civilized habits must necessarily be gradual, we were to retain the right of fishing at our accustomed fishing-places, and of hunting, gathering berries and roots, and pasturing stock on unoccupied land _as long as it remained vacant_. :8. At some future time, when it should have become fitted for it, the lands of the reservations were to be allotted to them in severalty.\\"(1) Stevens, Hazard (son) (1901).

Referenced in Indian tribes believed the treaties became effective when they were signed by the officials they had dealt with. But United States law required Congress to approve all treaties after they were negotiated by representatives. European Americans began to settle about 1845 but Congress did not approve the treaty until April 1859, which made such settlement legal.

Samish attendance was documented by George Gibbs and officially reported by Governor Issac Stevens. Although the Samish were listed next to the Lummi in the first draft of the treaty, it appears that line was inadvertently omitted during transcription of the final draft.Lane, Barbara. 1975. Identity, Treaty Status, and Fisheries of Samish Indian Tribe. Ethnological reports prepared for the Boldt trial. Several tribes, such as the Duwamish and Snohomish, continue working toward official federal recognition. See also, for example, Duwamish (tribe). =Selected articles= The treaty includes the following provisions: *ARTICLE 5. > The right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations is > further secured to said Indians in common with all citizens of the > Territory, Following a challenge by Native Americans in the late twentieth-century to federal policy excluding them from certain properties for fishing, they filed a suit. Judge George Boldt in the Boldt Decision (1974, upheld 1979) upheld their traditional right of access for fishing and hunting, as it was not restricted by the treaty. *ARTICLE 7. > The President may hereafter, when in his opinion the interests of the > Territory shall require and the welfare of the said Indians be promoted, > remove them from either or all of the special reservations herein before > make to the said general reservation, or such other suitable place within > said Territory as he may deem fit, on remunerating them for their > improvements and the expenses of such removal, or may consolidate them with > other friendly tribes or bands; and he may further at his discretion cause > the whole or any portion of the lands hereby reserved, or of such other land > as may be selected in lieu thereof, to be surveyed into lots, and assign the > same to suc[h] individuals or families as are willing to avail themselves of > the privilege, and will locate on the same as a permanent home on the same > terms and subject to the same regulations as are provided in the sixth > article of the treaty with the Omahas, so far as the same may be applicable. An attorney in the employ of the Natives during negotiations was concerned on their behalf with this language. *ARTICLE 12. > The said tribes and bands further agree not to trade at Vancouver's Island > or elsewhere out of the dominions of the United States, nor shall foreign > Indians be permitted to reside in their reservations without consent of the > superintendent or agent. The complete treaty, unabridged can be found on Wikisource. After the treaty The Pacific Northwest tribes had traditionally depended on harvests of salmon and other fish as a major part of their diets. Citing the treaties and their restrictions to reservations, the state and federal government increasingly restricted their fishing after 1890. There was a rise in both commercial and sports fisheries, dominated by European Americans. State repression increased through the 1950s. In a period of increased activism, in the 1960s several Native American tribes in the Northwest began protest fish- ins. They peacefully and successfully outmaneuvered police, garnering wide media attention. The Boldt Decision in 1974, which interpreted the Native Americans as having traditional rights to fish because they were not explicitly restricted by this and other treaties, was followed by state efforts to restrict them and resistance to their fishing by non-Indians. The case was appealed and in 1979, the US Supreme Court upheld Boldt's ruling in the lower court. Today regional fisheries councils, in which Native Americans, sports and commercial fishermen participate together with federal scientists and attorneys, annually review the status of particular fisheries to see how many fish are available for harvest, to review protection plans or their need, and to develop how they will share the harvests. In the same period, Native Americans outside reservations and without federal recognition, such as the Nooksack tribe, Upper Skagit, Sauks-Suiattle, and Stillaguamish peoples, won federal recognition in the 1970s, in order to secure certain financial benefits, including aid to education for their children. The BIA made the decisions based on their operating as cohesive political communities during the long treaty-rights struggles. Federal courts denied recognition to the Snohomish, Steilacoom, and Duwamish, because they were not recognized as polities (civil governments).Harmon in Hoxie (1996), pp. 522-3 Point Elliott Treaty Monument In 1930, the Point Elliott Treaty Monument was erected by the Marcus Whitman Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution at the northeast corner of Lincoln Avenue and 3rd Street in Mulkiteo. The monument, a slab of granite, is thick. A bronze plaque mounted on the west face is inscribed with text written by Edmond S. Meany. The monument commemorates the signing of the treaty, however the precise location of the signing is unknown. The Point Elliott Treaty Monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 14, 2004.

Publication history The Drake Shannon version of Orb debuted in Marvel Team-Up #15 (November 1973) and was created by writer Len Wein and artist Ross Andru. The second Orb first appeared in Ghost Rider #26 (Oct. 2008) and was created by Jason Aaron and Tan Eng Huat.https://www.newsarama.com/4640-jason- aaron-putting-ghost-rider-heaven-s-on-fire-out-p-2.html The Orb appeared as one of the villains in the 2014 crossover story Original Sin, which involved the theft of the eyes of the Watcher. Writer Jason Aaron said, \\"It was Tom [Breevort]'s ideally initially to use the Orb; no one will believe me on that, though. Using him is an obvious idea, but something I didn't think of until Tom mentioned it. Tom's thinking, rationally so, was that since we were doing a story which revolves around eyeballs being stolen then using a villain who got an eyeball for a head was perfect.\\" Fictional character biography =Drake Shannon= Drake Shannon was born in Wheeling, West Virginia. An accomplished motorcycle stunt rider, he owned one-half of the traveling motorcycle stunt show which would later feature Johnny Blaze (who would later become Ghost Rider). The other half of the show was owned by Blaze's mentor, Crash Simpson. While the partnership was initially amiable, the two men grew apart and eventually an intense rivalry developed. Neither wanted to work with the other, but neither wanted to sell their half of the show. To settle the dispute, the two men agreed to a lengthy race, with the winner receiving full ownership of the traveling show. After many miles of neck-and-neck competition, Shannon deliberately swerved towards Simpson in an effort to force Simpson to crash. However, the maneuver caused Shannon to lose control of his motorcycle. While Simpson managed to remain upright and continue on with the race, Shannon slid 25 yards on his unprotected face. The accident left him hideously disfigured. After his recovery, for reasons never adequately explained, Shannon was given a powerful motorcycle helmet by They Who Wield Power. The helmet, which was modeled to look like a giant eyeball, could hypnotize people. A later version could also shoot powerful laser beams from its \\"pupil\\". Calling himself \\"The Orb\\", Shannon attempted to take over the traveling motorcycle stunt show which he had once half-owned. He put the lives of dozens of innocent people at risk, but informed Johnny Blaze (now the sole owner of the stunt show) that he would let them go unharmed in exchange for the sole ownership of the stunt show. Although Blaze capitulated, Shannon instructed his minions to kill the hostages anyway, so that no one would know how the ownership changed hands. At this point, Ghost Rider and Spider-Man teamed up to defeat him.Marvel Team-Up #15 (November 1973). Marvel Comics Becoming a professional criminal, he returned several times, always plotting to get revenge on the Ghost Rider. The Orb attacked Delazny Studios, and battled the Ghost Rider again.Ghost Rider #14-15 (October and December. 1975). Marvel Comics He inflicted Roxanne Simpson with amnesia, and battled Ghost Rider once more.Ghost Rider #28 (February 1978). Marvel Comics He was later revealed to have been a pawn of \\"They Who Wield Power.\\"Incredible Hulk #241 (November 1979). Marvel Comics Alongside Madame Menace, he battled Ghost Rider once again.Ghost Rider #63 (December 1981). Marvel Comics At one point he also crossed paths with Hawkeye. The Orb battled Hawkeye, and alongside Hawkeye he discovered Plantman's mobile plant-growing factory, and was shot by Plantman's stimuloids.Solo Avengers #19-20 (June‚ÄìJuly 1989); Avengers Spotlight #21 (Aug. 1989). Marvel Comics =Agent of Zadkiel= A successor to the original Orb. He was born with a head that resembled a giant eye and was abandoned at a young age and grew up in a freak show.Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire #5 (November 2010). Marvel Comicshttps://pulllist.comixology.com/previews/OCT090523/5/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/43312 After performing a number of unidentified jobs, this Orb was hired to take down Caretaker alongside Blackout II, Death-Ninja and Doghead. Blackout alleged that the Orb was killed by the Caretaker,Ghost Rider #26 (Oct. 2008). Marvel Comics but it was later revealed that he was merely hospitalized with massive eye trauma.Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire #2 (November 2009). Marvel Comics He is later one of the villains considered by Blackout and the Deacon to help them assassinate the Ghost Rider.Ghost Rider #33 (May 2009). Marvel Comics He was later broken out of prison and began to work for Zadkiel.Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire #1-2 (October - November 2009). Marvel Comics During the climactic confrontation with the Ghost Riders, the Orb had the fingers of his left hand shot off and was again returned to the prison hospital as a cellmate of the paralyzed Deacon.Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire #5-6 (February - March 2010). Marvel Comics This second Orb was notable for the fact that he almost never stopped talking (much to the frustration of both his teammates and his enemies) and that while he always boasted of his prowess with his repulsor ray, he never actually successfully hit anyone with it. Orb resurfaced in the Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine miniseries, robbing a bank. He was sent skipping through time by some glowing diamonds. Eventually, he gained some understanding of time travel but was apprehended by the Minutemen before he could put this knowledge to use.Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #1-6 (July 2010-July 2011). Marvel Comics Orb later appeared with a group of minions in eye-based masks, having just stolen the eyes of a group of people at a bank. Clearly insane, he claimed that he rolled around naked in eyeballs, regarding the eyes as 'windows to the soul' that he could gather power from before his rematch with the Ghost Rider. He claimed that he could see the true selves of the Hulk and Red She-Hulk when he looked into their eyes, describing Betty's conflicting relationship with her father and recognizing that a 'monster' was behind Hulk's eyes that was not the Hulk himself.Incredible Hulk #7.1 (July 2012). Marvel Comics In the wake of Uatu the Watcher's murder in the 2014 miniseries \\"Original Sin\\", Orb and Exterminatrix are discovered to be in possession of one of Uatu's gouged-out eyes,Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). Original Sin #1 (July 2014). Marvel Comics but after he is captured, he maintains that he did not commit the murder.Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). Original Sin #3 (August 2014). Marvel Comics Doctor Strange and Punisher then take Orb to a satellite,Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). Original Sin #4 (August 2014). Marvel Comics where Orb collapses due to his body's absorption of the things he stole from Uatu's home.Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). Original Sin #5 (September 2014). Marvel Comics As the storyline concludes, the Orb has merged with one of Uatu's eyes, which now resides in his chest.Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). Original Sin #8 (October 2014). Marvel Comics Orb reappears trying to steal a future-predicting Rigellian Recorder from Deadpool and the Mercs for Money, claiming that the burden of the Watcher's power has made him want to prevent anyone else from having access to similar capabilities, \\"because I've seen what that can do to someone!\\" In the midst of a high-speed highway battle, he and his motorcycle are knocked into the Big Wheel by Merc member Foolkiller. He returns having kidnapped Doctor Strange in the \\"Blood in the Aether\\" storyline, where he is revealed to have regained the Watcher's power, now influencing those he observes to commit more brutal actions, such as telling a loner in an apartment that he is viewed as a creep by others in the building and should kill them in response. Powers and abilities Drake Shannon is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He is an expert stunt motorcyclist and a capable hand-to-hand combatant. However, the Orb is criminally insane as a result of the accident which disfigured his face. As the Orb, he wears a helmet originally provided by \\"They Who Wield Power\\" composed of unspecified materials, containing specialized micro-circuitry, capable of firing laser blasts and hypnotizing victims. The Orb rides a motorcycle which he specially modified. The second Orb used a repulsor ray gun. Unlike the original Orb, this Orb's head is an actual giant eyeball.Ghost Rider #27 (November 2008), letters page. Marvel Comics He claims to be able to talk by flexing certain muscles in his 'eye'/head. He has merged with one of the eyes of Uatu, which now resides in his chest.

History William Ronald was a graduate of the Ontario College of Art in 1951 who quickly found that abstract painters could not get their work exhibited in Toronto galleries. Since he had previously Worked for the Robert Simpson Co. department store, he persuaded management to pair abstract paintings with furniture displays, thereby discovering a way to get the public to accept non-representational art. Despite the success of that show, Abstracts at Home, Ronald resented the city's general attitude toward its artists and moved to the United States, eventually becoming an American citizen. Ronald joined the stable of artists at Manhattan's Kootz Gallery, where he was put on retainer. He was quickly accepted by critics, collectors, and artists such as Franz Kline, and enjoyed a multi-year period of success. Eventually, Ronald returned to Toronto, as a landed immigrant in the country of his birth, partly due to changing market conditions and partly because he could not get along with Kootz. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Besides painting, he became known as a CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) journalist, hosting such shows as Umbrella and As It Happens, a columnist for the Toronto Telegram, and host of a Citytv variety show. He continued to paint through the 1970s, '80s and '90s, moving to Montreal, Quebec, and then to Barrie, Ontario where he maintained an active studio. He gained some notoriety for his portrait series of Canadian Prime Ministers, a pioneering highly abstracted portrayal of heads of government opened by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in Toronto. The exhibition toured Canada, despite warnings not to exhibit the less than flattering portrait of then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. They are currently part of the permanent collection of the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery in Kitchener, Ontario. Never a stranger to criticism or polemics, Ronald loved to paint in public, frequently hiring strippers and showgirls to dance around him as he painted. He continued to paint until his death in 1998 and in fact suffered a heart attack while painting Untitled. He succumbed a few days later.

It is a two-act play set in 1972 on a farm near Clinton, Ontario. There are only three characters: the farm's two owners, Morgan and Angus, and Miles Potter, a young actor from Toronto doing research for a collectively created theatre piece about farming. The Drawer Boy premiered at Theatre Passe Muraille in 1999, starring Tom Barnett, David Fox and Jerry Franken. The Drawer Boy was published in 1999 by Playwrights Canada Press. Plot The Drawer Boy replays the adventures of a young actor from a Toronto theatre group who visits the rural Ontario home of two elderly bachelor farmers to \\"research\\" farm life for a new play. In doing so, he demonstrates the way in which a collective creation appropriated the lives of its subjects and changed their own interpretation of it. The two farmers, Morgan and Angus, have achieved a precarious balance in their lives together. Morgan, a tough-minded, stubborn man, cares for Angus, who has had brain damage and lost his memory during the bombing of London in the Second World War. Angus is initially identified as \\"the drawer boy\\" because he used to design buildings and has the talents of an architect. Morgan calms and reassures Angus by retelling their story - of the two tall women whom they loved, and who came to live with them in Canada. The young actor, Miles, learns, however, that this story is a fiction and that the truth is much sadder. It would, in fact, destroy their friendship. In the process of telling their story as play, however, he reawakens Angus's memory. Art becomes life. Miles is in effect the \\"drawer boy,\\" delineating and creating an alternative reality. As he tells Morgan, \\"We're here to get your history and give it back to you.\\" The Drawer Boy is fundamentally about the power of storytelling in creating and interpreting reality and how it can transform lives. There is much more in the play than a history of Canadian drama. The Drawer Boy premiered in Toronto at Theatre Passe Muraille in 1999 and was subsequently produced by Ed Mirvish Productions at the more opulent Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto and the Manitoba Theatre Centre, Winnipeg in 2001. The 2001/02 revival was a collaboration between the National Arts Centre in Ottawa and has toured to the major regional theatres: Hamilton's Theatre Aquarius, Edmonton's Citadel Theatre, and the Vancouver Playhouse. It has won the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding New Play, a Chalmers Award, and a Governor General's Award. The Drawer Boy received its London premiere at Finborough Theatre on 19 June 2012, with John Bett, Neil McCaul and Simon Lee Phillips, directed by Eleanor Rhode. The revival was produced by London theatre company Snapdragon Productions. Basis The Drawer Boy (1999) by Michael Healey revisits the origins of an alternative Canadian theatre - the collective creation of The Farm Show in 1972 by Theatre Passe Muraille. As the National Arts Centre programme for The Drawer Boy explains: \\"In the 1970s a group of actors, including The Drawer Boy's director, Miles Potter and actor David Fox, who plays Angus in The Drawer Boy, working with Paul Thompson, the Artistic Director of Passe Muraille, headed into the rural heartland of southern Ontario and, after interviewing local farmers and their families, created a landmark Canadian theatrical event: The Farm Show. Almost two and a half decades later, Michael Healey went to work as an actor at the Blyth Festival and came into contact with many of the farmers and members of the local community whose stories had served as inspiration for The Farm Show. The longevity of the impact of that experience, in turn, inspired the playwright to write his tribute to the power of art, The Drawer Boy.\\" Reviews Joel Greenberg states in his theatre review for Aisle Say, \\"Thirty years ago, when The Farm Show was first created - it is the inspiration for Healey's play - no one in the local theatre community would have guessed that such movement was possible. That was a time when the 'underground' and the 'mainstream' were separated by a gulf too wide to consider negotiable. Happily, time has provided a bridge that makes such distinctions increasingly irrelevant.\\" Canadian novelist and poet Michael Ondaatje believes that \\"it is one of the few plays to create an authentic tradition in our culture,\\" and former Globe and Mail critic Kate Taylor states that it \\"is fast turning into a Canadian classic.\\" The London premiere of the play, presented by Snapdragon Productions at the Finborough Theatre, was praised by the critics. The Guardian called the play \\"a landmark in Canadian theatre\\", and The Stage praised the play as a \\"modern classic in the making\\". In her five-star review for WhatsOnStage.com, Amy Stow praised the production as \\"delicately and sympathetically approached by director Eleanor Rhode, who skilfully draws out the humour within each relationship, and creates an immersive world which the audience can simply sink into.\\" Film adaptation Arturo P√©rez Torres and Aviva Armour-Ostroff directed the 2017 film adaption The Drawer Boy. The film was shot in Ontario, starring Stuart Hughes as Angus, Richard Clarkin as Morgan, and Jakob Ehman as Miles. It won best feature at several festivals including the Canadian Film Festival, the Heartland Film Festival and the Anchorage International Film Festival. The film was released in theaters and on Video on Demand in November 2018 by the streaming media service HighballTV.

Context Books) After Dachau is a novel written by Ishmael author Daniel Quinn that was published in 2001. Plot summary The story is narrated by a young rich man, heir to a huge sum of money. He devotes his life to an organization called \\"We Live Again\\" which investigates the reality of reincarnation. People have souls that pass on to other individuals and give them their memories, usually alongside, but sometimes in place of their own memories. The story focuses on Mallory Gabus, a recently reincarnated woman and her fascinating integration into the new world. She recalls and narrates her experiences and memories of Hitler's victory, which allowed Hitler to bring his desire for an \\"Aryan\\" world to fruition. She realizes all that went wrong. The Nazis had won World War II and purged their empire of all non- whites, then rewrote history so as to say that Dachau, a concentration camp, was instead a battle with Adolf Hitler as its hero. After Hitler's victory, the Third Reich is solely Aryan, the Aryans have killed all non-Aryans in their new empire. They now use A.D. to refer to After Dachau, the turning point in their civilization, and \\"A.D.-A.D.\\" to refer to our A.D. Mallory was (re-)born in 1922 A.D.-A.D. as an Afro-American woman in New York. We find out that the Nazi purges in the Third Reich have started to have a cultural effect on the United States, and soon Jews are being executed. Blacks are being \\"repatriated\\", which turns out to mean that they are being placed into concentration camps. Mallory hides out with her lover in the New York City underground and makes a life until their hiding place is discovered by police. At that point, they commit suicide rather than being taken alive or executed. Jason Tull, the Protagonist, in an attempt to publicize the story and the atrocities the Aryans committed, contacts a newspaper and other news media. His investigation gets him sequestered in an unknown location until he can write three words upon a chalkboard. The words turn out to be \\"No One Cares\\", and, as it turns out, no one does. The narrator explains that he cares, and he doesn't care if others don't care, he is still going to pursue this for his own personal interest. He opens an exhibit displaying relics from the old world, including works by Jewish authors such as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The narrator receives a gift from his \\"uncle\\" (the man who imprisoned him), and expresses his intent to publish the gift. He opens a shop where he displays pictures of Africans that had been saved in Mallory's hideout. Finally, one night, someone throws a brick through the gallery's windows, prompting the narrator to conclude that somebody \\"does care\\". The last line reveals that the gift is The Diary of a Young Girl, written during World War II, the Diary of Anne Frank. Major themes To novice eyes, reincarnation would appear to be a major theme of the book. However, this is not the case. Quinn has stated that he merely used reincarnation as a convenient vehicle for telling his story, and that he does not endorse (or oppose) the idea of reincarnation. The major theme of this book is the social constructedness of history and of what we take to be the foundations of social reality. In this book, Quinn uses the example of the Holocaust to make his argument - he suggests that had history gone slightly differently (i.e. had the Germans won World War II), we might have been fooled into thinking of a monstrous evil as something not really worth concerning ourselves with. This dovetails with his other work, in that much of Quinn's work focuses on re-telling the conventionally accepted narrative of human progress over the last 10,000 years in a way that he hopes will inspire people to be horrified and realize the need to change course with regard to humanity's relationship to its environment. Other points made: 1\\\\. Capitalism and the progress with it, is a Jewish invention, the Aryan (and a very collectivist) motto being \\"if it works why change it?\\" 2\\\\. History is written by the winners, and at such a distant point it does not really matter anymore because humans are resigned to bad action, which is explained via \\"No One Cares.\\" 3\\\\. The view of history is a very Neo-Nazi view of the modern world. 4\\\\. A person's body does not constitute who they are.

Created by Peter David, Calhoun is an extraterrestrial from the planet Xenex, and is captain of the Federation starship USS Excalibur. Calhoun appears primarily in Star Trek: New Frontier, a series of spin-off novels and comic books set during the 24th century era of Star Trek: The Next Generation, in which he is the main character. He first appeared in the 1997 New Frontier debut novel, Star Trek: New Frontier: House of Cards. Calhoun is the only Star Trek character that has not appeared in any of the Star Trek television series or movies to have an action figure. Publication history In 1997 Pocket Books introduced Star Trek: New Frontier, a novel series written by Peter David that featured a combination of original characters and recurring, supporting characters from the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation and its spinoffs. The series is centered upon the U.S.S. Excalibur, a starship of the United Federation of Planets, which is commanded by the series' star, Captain Mackenzie Calhoun. The series was a popular success, and led to New Frontier comic books and appearances in Star Trek video games and action figures. Fictional character history Calhoun is born M'k'n'zy of Calhoun on the planet Xenex, in the city of Calhoun. He grows up under the brutal rule of the Danteri, who occupied his world. As a child, M'k'n'zy witnesses the public execution of his father in a town square by Falkar of Danter, which spurs him to grow into a rebel warlord.Peter David. Star Trek: New Frontier: House of Cards; 1997 He kills his first person at age 14, and is given command of a strike vessel that marked the beginning of the Xenexian rebellion.Peter David. Star Trek New Frontier: The Captain's Table, Book 5: Once Burned By the time M'k'n'zy is 20, he liberates Xenex. Shortly after doing so, he fathers a son, Xyon, with Catrine, a woman from the Calhoun clan whose husband had died, as she requests as part of Xenexian culture.Peter David. Star Trek: New Frontier: Martyr Calhoun encounters Jean-Luc Picard, who, while commanding the USS Stargazer, visits Xenex as a representative of the United Federation of Planets to assist in negotiations between Xenex and Danter. Picard convinced Calhoun to join Starfleet, the scientific and defensive arm of the Federation. Calhoun leaves Xenex, a move which rouses the ire of many of his people, to enter Starfleet Academy, where he meets Elizabeth Shelby, who would become his lover, rival and, eventually, fianc√©e. Their engagement ends after Calhoun took the Kobayashi Maru test.Peter David. Star Trek: New Frontier: Stone and Anvil As a Starfleet officer, Calhoun served aboard the USS Grissom, where he meets Katarina \\"Kat\\" Mueller, who would become his lover. It was on the Grissom that he learns to play poker, and establishes a reputation for being able to bluff his way through any hand, even evading an empath's attempt to get a bead on him.Peter David. Star Trek: New Frontier: Into the Void Calhoun was present during a catastrophic event aboard the Grissom, which led to his apparent departure from Starfleet. In reality, he becomes an undercover operative for head of Starfleet Intelligence Admiral Alynna Nechayev who, years afterward, fearing Calhoun was getting \\"too deep\\" into the lifestyle of the thugs and criminals he was associating with, pulled him out and gave him his own starship to command, the USS Excalibur. It was in taking this command that he is reunited with both Shelby, who was now his First Officer, and Mueller, whom he picked as his Executive Officer (the terms are normally synonymous on the various television series, but in the New Frontier novels, a First Officer heads the ship's day shift, while the Executive Officer commands the night shift watch). Calhoun is assigned to Sector 221-G, the area of space of the former Thallonian Empire, which has collapsed, resulting in destabilization of the region. Calhoun makes an appearance in the 2007 Star Trek: The Next Generation novel Before Dishonor by Peter David. In the novel, Calhoun encounters Picard en route to Sector 001 to defend Earth against a new Borg threat. Calhoun's older brother, D‚Äôndai, dies during an alien invasion of his homeworld, Xenex, in the 2011 novel Blind Man's Bluff. Mirror Universe The Mirror Mac, from Star Trek: New Frontier: Turnaround #3 (April 2008). Art by Stephen Thompson. The Mirror Universe counterpart of Calhoun first appears in \\"Cutting Ties\\", a story in the 2007 anthology Star Trek Mirror Universe: Obsidian Alliances. In the mirror universe, instead of witnessing his father's fatal beating at the hands of the Danteri, young M'k'n'zy begs for his father's life, insisting that he has no knowledge of D'ndai's rebellious activities. Humiliated by what he sees as his son's weakness, Gr'zy disowns the boy, who is treated as an outcast. When Praetor Hiren, the leader of the Danteri's allies, the Romulans, comes to Calhoun, he takes the boy, whom he renames \\"Muck\\", to live with him on Romulus, as assurance against further rebellion. The abusive Hiren gives Muck a scar on his face corresponding to the one possessed by Captain Calhoun in our universe. After a year in Hiren's residence, Hiren orders the boy to execute Gr'zy, who has continued his rebellion, but Gr'zy commits suicide before Muck can do this. The furious Hiren banishes Muck to the mines of Remus, where the young slave endures years of torment from other miners, until he kills his tormenters. He is eventually purchased by the Mirror Soleta and her father, Rojan, and becomes Soleta's lover. Muck and Soleta are present during a meeting arranged by Praetor Hiren between Rojan and the Mirror Lord Si Cwan of the Thallonian Empire and Falkar of Danter aboard Si Cwan's ship, the Stinger. There, Muck meets the Mirror Kalinda, Burgoyne 182, Zak Kebron, Robin Lefler, and Elizabeth Shelby. Muck discovers that the Mirror Mark McHenry's god-like powers are used as the ship's intelligence and power source. Rojan is murdered on the orders of Hiren, along with Falkar and Shelby, enraging the heartbroken Muck. Si Cwan, Kebron, and Burgoyne are also killed, and Muck and Soleta take control of the Stinger, with Muck intending to destroy the surface of Danter, Romulus, Xenex, and every planet he can find, arguing that the universe deserves to die. McHenry shows Muck the Mackenzie Calhoun of our universe, and the life he has led. Inspired by the possibilities he can fight for, Muck destroys only Danter's military infrastructure and uninhabited areas of its surface, liberating Xenex. Inspired by his counterpart, he takes the name \\"Mac\\", and begins his life anew as a freedom fighter.Peter David. 2007; Star Trek: Mirror Universe: Obsidian Alliances; \\"Cutting Ties\\"; Page 199 Calhoun and his crew next appear in the 2008 comic book miniseries Star Trek: New Frontier: Turnaround.

His plan is foiled by the crews of the Excalibur, the Trident, and Bravo Station, and his counterpart from the prime universe, Captain Calhoun, who cautions him not to try to reshape an entire universe, lest catastrophic results occur. When Calhoun tells him that Admiral Shelby is aboard Bravo Station, which is being pummeled by the Paradox, Mac surrenders, and the Paradox is destroyed. Mac takes his crew back to the Mirror Universe, where the mirror McHenry reveals that he arranged the confrontation between the two Calhouns so that Mac would reach the right conclusion himself, and call off the plan. Calhoun next appears in \\"Homecoming\\", a short story in the 2009 anthology Star Trek: Mirror Universe - Shards and Shadows. The Stinger has now been renamed the Excalibur, and has embarked on a campaign against the Alliance, gathering a small army as it attacks Alliance colonies, becoming a symbol of the rebellion. The Excalibur rescues the Mirror Selar from an escape pod. Selar, a scientist and spy disguised as a Romulan named Thue, was part of a team en route to Romulus to assemble a thalaron bomb in order to establish weapons parity with the Alliance. Her cargo vessel, which carried the bomb's final component, C-170, was attacked by the Alliance to prevent the Romulans from using the bomb against them. The Excalibur crew track down the hijacked supply ship and retake it, before journeying to Romulus with the C-170. As they assemble the bomb, they are confronted by Praetor Hiren, meeting Mac for the first time since his childhood. Hiren is forced into an allegiance with Mac against the Alliance, who arrive to take possession of the thalaron bomb, which they intend to test detonate on Romulus. During the ensuing melee, Hiren, who had tried to prevent an open confrontation with the Alliance, orders his forces in orbit to attack the Alliance ship battling the Excalibur, and the bomb is accidentally detonated. Mac and his crew, along with Hiren, are transported to the Excalibur. Romulus is rendered uninhabitable for a millennium, with only 50,000 Romulans surviving among their fleet - which, on Hiren's orders, proceeds to join Mac's rebel forces.Peter David (2009). \\"Homecoming\\", Star Trek Mirror Universe: Shards and Shadows, Pocket Books, pp. 271-310.

David has explained that Calhoun was not intentionally a remodeled Stone, but that both were based to some extent by characters portrayed by film actor Mel Gibson: the apparently unstable \\"cowboy diplomat\\" Stone was based on Martin Riggs from the Lethal Weapon films, and Calhoun, who was a rebel leader at 20, was inspired by the Scottish rebel leader William Wallace from Braveheart. David has added that Calhoun is closer to the historical Wallace, in that like Calhoun, Wallace was much younger than the real-life Gibson was when he portrayed Wallace in the movie.David, Peter (October 21, 2003).

Clear Creek's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300‚Äì350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas. Summary In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Clear Creek became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk. Until November 2008, Clear Creek was an undisturbed rural community with little interference from the Government of Ontario. There are no sidewalks for safe pedestrian walking and wind turbines are seen very frequently within the vicinity of Clear Creek; being installed in November 2008.Clear Creek Wind Farm at Canadian Wind Energy Association Wind turbine construction activity was at its highest around the year 2008, after which it tapered off. Approximately 70 people live in this town among the 140 houses, some of which have been abandoned due to safety issues from the wind turbines. People have lived in this community as far back as 1901 with some Canadian soldiers from the First World War having been raised in this community.Community information at ePodunk Norfolk County has banned the placement of new wind turbines after becoming a \\"willing host\\" for them back in 2003. One of the council members were worried about Norfolk County becoming \\"industrialized\\" and \\"unnatural.\\" Many leaders in Norfolk County envision the county as being an agricultural hub for Southern Ontario even by the middle of the 22nd century. At least 105 species of bird have been discovered here from 1986 to 2019; including the Upland Sandpiper, the Scarlet Tanager, and the Yellow Warbler. The nearest high school is Valley Heights Secondary School which is to the northeast. Students from here grab the same high school bus as the students from Houghton. =Cemetery= There are at least 247 individuals, or families, who have their remains buried at Clear Creek Cemetery. The cemetery is a United Empire Loyalist cemetery that includes veterans from the War of 1812, among others. Common last names found in the cemetery include Allen, Bates, Bauer, Becker, Brown, Crawford, and Fish. The most recent person at Clear Creek Cemetery died in 2019 while people were started to be buried at this cemetery during the 1830s.Clear Creek Cemetery at Find a Grave The oldest female person to be buried at this cemetery is Harriet Brown (who died in 1832 in her 31st year) while the oldest male person to be buried at this cemetery is Thomas Dawson (who died in 1834 in his 58th year).Additional Clear Creek Cemetery information at Find a Grave There is only one member of the Millennials generation (born between 1980 and 2005) that is buried at Clear Creek Cemetery.[https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/2190811/memorial- search?orderby=b-&page;=1#sr-101476047 Millennials in Clear Creek Cemetery =Climate= Between the years 1897 and 1977, only the winter of 1975 was considered to be a mild winter for Southern Ontario communities along Lake Erie including Clear Creek. From the late 1990s onwards, winters have become more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Clear Creek traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. As in all communities, towns and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Clear Creek over the decades. Should the sea levels rise by , Clear Creek would not be affected by flooding. However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available fresh water and may be forced to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from the Eastern United States. Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments.

It was produced by Chris Bearde and hosted by Dick Martin along with his side- kick Wanda (Janelle Price).http://www.film.com/tv/the-cheap-show/21328627 The show's announcer was Charlie O'Donnell. Gameplay Two couples competed to win cheap junk prizes and save their loved ones from slapstick \\"torture,\\" which consisted of the show \\"taking a cheap shot at\\" them of some sort, with the winning couple getting the chance to win real prizes at the end of the show. =Main game= There were three rounds, each consisting of one question. Two celebrities composed a panel; a seat was reserved for a third, who was always a \\"no-show\\" for some mysterious reason. For each round, a question was asked to the panel. One celebrity gave the correct answer, while the other gave a bluff. Each couple was divided, with the female at the contestants' podium, and the male trapped inside \\"The Punishment Pit.\\" The first answering contestant guessed which celebrity was telling the truth. If she was correct, that couple scored one point and a cheap \\"prize\\" (such as an old bee smoker or a burned-out hair dryer), while the other player's loved one was \\"punished\\" with a pie in his face, slime, or some other sloppy substance. If she was incorrect, her own loved one received his punishment and the opposing couple won the point and the \\"prize\\". In the second round, the other couple was given the guess, and the same procedure was followed. The first two rounds were worth one point apiece, and the third round was worth 20 points; this rendered the first two useless from a competitive standpoint. Whichever contestant had the most points \\"at the end of three rounds\\" advanced to the bonus round. =The Semi-Colossal Prize Sweepstakes Finale= A wheel was set up in the studio with twelve numbered spaces, each of which correlated to a numbered envelope on a \\"prize wall\\". Each space also had a hole. To determine the prize the couple would win, a large white rat, referred to on the show as \\"Oscar the Wonder Rodent\\", was placed on the wheel while it was being spun. The hole Oscar crawled into determined the prize that was won. At this stage in the show, no cheap \\"booby prizes\\" were awarded as they were in the main game; the winning couple won standard game show fare such as appliances or trips. In addition, the couple was asked before the wheel was spun to guess the hole they thought Oscar would crawl into; if the rat crawled into that hole, the couple won the grand prize (usually a car) in addition to the prize associated with that space. Reviews Many of the reviews were mixed. One TV reviewer, who worked at the now-defunct Philadelphia Journal, thought the show was so bad he had a viewer do a review; the layout failed to include the standard formatting, employing instead a double-spaced sheet of standard copy used at that time. Episode status The current status of the show is unknown, and may have been destroyed due to a common practice known as wiping. One episode, the premiere, currently exists among private collectors. Another episode (episode 4) with Rita Moreno and David Doyle, plus a seat reserved for no-show Henry Ford, is available for viewing on YouTube. Three others, with guests Truman Capote and Jill St. John (episode 2), Anthony Newley and Bob Newhart (episode 18), and Jim Stafford with Charlie Callas (episode 23), exist at the UCLA television archives, along with the Moreno/Doyle episode.http://gameshow.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=15613&st;=7 On one other memorable episode, Richard Nixon was a no-show guest, while Gary Owens and Barbi Benton were the guests that showed up.

History North Phoenix High School opened its doors in 1939, becoming the first high school built after George Washington Carver High School, a school that was built for segregation purposes. = Closure = By 1981, the school's enrollment had fallen to 814. As a result, North High was closed in 1981, and would become one of four schools to close during the 1980s. As a result of the closures, two lawsuits were filed, accusing the Phoenix Union High School District of discriminating against ethnic minorities and low-income students by closing schools in their neighborhoods, in addition to unfair resource allocations. The lawsuits were later consolidated into the Castro v. Phoenix Union High School District lawsuit, in which a federal judge ruled against the school district. That ruling resulted in the reopening of North High, as well as, among other measures, the establishment of magnet programs across the district. Phoenix Union High School District's website makes no reference to the controversy surrounding the school's closure and eventual reopening, merely stating that the school closed, due to declining enrollment, and later reopened. = Reopening = The school reopened in 1983, and in 1984, 875 students were enrolled at the school.  Campus  The school's campus was built using funds from the Works Progress Administration and Public Works Administration, both established as part of the New Deal. The school is noted for having built-in lockers in the hallways, at a time when every other school within the Phoenix Union High School District has removed theirs. Film and commercial producers have said the school reminds people of a traditional high school. The school's football field contains lattice tower light poles and a concrete grandstand.  In popular culture  The 1996 movie No One Would Tell was filmed on the school's campus. Charles Barkley filmed his \\"I am not a role model\\" commercial for Nike at the school's gymnasium.

Prior to that he was an assistant director at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. He is the Director of Opera Studies at Manhattan School of Music. Thompson has directed numerous independent productions, and since 2000, when he directed his first opera, Porgy and Bess for the New York City Opera, has been called on to direct more operas and musicals. His success led to invitations to direct productions of Francis Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites for the Glimmerglass Opera and City Opera in 2002 and 2004, respectively, as well as other works. Thompson was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 as Best Director for the televised production of his Porgy and Bess produced at Arena Stage in Washington, DC. In August 2012, he directed Maxwell Anderson and Kurt Weill's Lost in the Stars (1949) for Glimmerglass Opera, a musical based on the South African classic novel Cry, the Beloved Country by Alan Paton. As a playwright, Thompson has also received recognition, with numerous productions of his Constant Star (2002) about the activist Ida B. Wells. His play, Mary T. & Lizzy K., about Mary Todd Lincoln and Elizabeth Keckley, premiered in Washington, D.C., at Arena Stage in 2013. Jubilee, an a cappella musical that he wrote and directed based on the Fisk Jubilee Singers of Fisk University, also had its premiere at Arena Stage, in 2019. Early life and education Tazewell Thompson was born in 1948 in New York City. His childhood was difficult as his father, a jazz musician, frequently traveled. His mother had emotional problems and, after a fire in their apartment in which his three-year-old brother died, she grew unable to care for him. When Tazewell was eight, his paternal grandmother intervened to help him, placing him in a home run by the Sisters of St. Dominic in Blauvelt, New York. He lived with them for six years. He has fond memories of the sisters who encouraged his interest in theatre. He drew on his experiences years later in directing Poulenc's opera Dialogues of the Carmelites. Career As an actor, Thompson was a cast member of the original Broadway productions of The National Health (1974)\\"Tazewell Thompson, Performer\\" at IBDB. and Checking Out (1976).\\"Tazewell Thompson\\", IMDb. He acted in numerous Off-Off-Broadway pop art plays by Rosalyn Drexler. Theatre direction In New York, Thompson taught at St. Ann's School and mounted ambitious productions with its students, including Stephen Sondheim's Follies and Ph√®dre (in French). He continued his independent acting and direction as well. His direction of a revival of Aaron Copland's opera The Second Hurricane at the Henry Street Settlement gained him attention. Zelda Fichandler, director and co-founder of the Arena Stage in Washington, DC, invited him to work with her as an assistant director. While in Washington, Thompson discovered and directed early work of playwright Cheryl West, beginning with Before It Hits Home. When selected in 1992 as the artistic director of Syracuse Stage, Thompson became one of a handful of black directors to head a regional theatre, including Kenny Leon of the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, George C. Wolfe at the New York Shakespeare Festival, and Lloyd Richards, the longtime artistic director of the Yale Repertory Theater.\\"Director Shakes Up Syracuse Stage\\", The New York Times, February 24, 1994. He regularly informally greeted the audience after the plays and, early in his tenure, assured subscribers he intended to make the theatre's repertory more inclusive. His first season he produced, Jar the Floor, by Cheryl L. West, which proved to be one of the most popular productions. In June 2005, Thompson was selected as artistic director at the Westport Country Playhouse in Westport, Connecticut, serving through the 2007 season. Thompson has also done freelance directing. In 2000, he directed Porgy and Bess for the New York City Opera. In 2002, he directed Francis Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites for the Glimmerglass Opera and in 2004 for the City Opera. In the summer of 2004 he directed Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience at Glimmerglass. He did Benjamin Britten's Death in Venice for them in the summer of 2005.Anne Midgette, \\"One Opera, Two Convents, 16 Martyrs\\", The New York Times, October 10, 2004, accessed 14 February 2013 In May 2006, he directed Porgy and Bess in Washington, DC.DC Theatre Reviews, May 14, 2006.

In July 2019, he directed Jeanine Tesori's new opera Blue for which he had also written the libretto, at Glimmerglass. The opera picks up the issue of African-American teenage boys having become a prime target of police brutality in the United States. Playwright Thompson has written and directed several plays, including Constant Star (2002), a musical drama about the life of the 19th-century activist and journalist Ida B. Wells, first produced in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at City Theatre.Alisa C. Roost, \\"'Constant Star' (review)\\", Theatre Journal, Volume 55, Number 1, March 2003, pp. 158‚Äì159  10.1353/tj.2003.0039, JSTOR, accessed February 14, 2013. It uses five actresses to play Wells, who also portray other figures in her life. Although primarily a drama, it includes about 20 negro spirituals sung by the actresses and used as transitions. The play has toured the United States. Thompson said of his play: :My first introduction to Ida B. Wells was the PBS documentary on her life. Her story gnawed at me. A woman born in slavery, she would grow to become one of the great pioneer activists of the Civil Rights Movement. A precursor of Rosa Parks, she was a suffragist, newspaper editor and publisher, investigative journalist, co-founder of the NAACP, political candidate, mother, wife, and the single most powerful leader in the anti- lynching campaign in America. A dynamic, controversial, temperamental, uncompromising race woman, she broke bread and crossed swords with some of the movers and shakers of her time: Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, Marcus Garvey, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, President McKinley. By any fair assessment, she was a seminal figure in Post-Reconstruction America. * Mary T. & Lizzy K.

The company was established during 1959 and was initially operated as a joint venture between Nord Aviation of France, and Weser Flugzeugbau (WFB) and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) of Germany. Later on, production was by French aerospace company A√©rospatiale, and German aircraft manufacturers Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW), and Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB) respectively. Production of its sole product, the C-160, was terminated during 1985. Since then, all three companies merged together to form the multinational aerospace giant EADS, which subsequently rebranded itself as the Airbus Group. History During the late 1950s, a requirement arose to replace the piston- engined Nord Noratlas transports operated by the French Air Force and the German Air Force. In the postwar era, many politicians in both countries were keen to encourage industrial co-operation between France and Germany; examples of this had already occurred in the aircraft manufacturing sector, such as a previous arrangement in which Noratlases for the German Air Force had been produced under license by German aircraft manufacturer Weser Flugzeugbau. On 28 November 1957, representatives from both France and Germany signed an agreement calling for the joint development of a successor to the Noratlas. The Italian government also became involved in the project early on to meet their own air force's requirements; however, Italy's participation in the fledgling program was soon terminated in favour of the smaller and locally- built Fiat G.222 instead. In January 1959, a consortium, named the \\"Transporter-Allianz\\" or Transall, was formally established to develop and produce this new transport aircraft; its initial membership comprised the French aircraft manufacturer Nord Aviation and the German companies Weser Flugzeugbau (which became Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) in 1964) and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB).Wilson Flight International 25 April 1968, p. 614.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, p. 286. Each of the production partners was responsible for the construction of a single prototype; the first (built by Nord) performed its maiden flight on 25 May 1963, while the VFW and HFB-built prototypes followed on 25 May 1963 and 19 February 1964 respectively.Wilson Flight International 25 April 1968, p. 615. These prototypes were followed by six pre-production examples, which made their first flights between 1965 and 1966; these aircraft were stretched by compared with the prototypes.Wilson Flight International 25 April 1968, p. 616. A German Air Force Transall C-160D arriving at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, England, on 10 July 2014, for the Royal International Air Tattoo Production orders were delayed by the unsuccessful efforts of American defense company Lockheed to sell its C-130 Hercules transport to the German Air Force as an alternative to the C-160. On 24 September 1964, a formal production contract was signed, ordered a combined lot of 160 C-160s (110 for Germany and 50 for France). Workshare on the type's manufacture was divided between Germany and France broadly in line with the number of orders placed. While Nord produced both the wings and engine nacelles, VFW manufactured the centre fuselage and horizontal tail, and HFB constructed the forward and rear fuselage; the aircraft's tail fin was also built by Dornier. Three separate assembly lines were established, where the sections produced by each of the three main partner companies were brought together to form complete aircraft. During 1967, the first production airframes were delivered to France and Germany. The first batch included 110 C-160Ds for the German Air Force (Luftwaffe), 50 C-160Fs for the French Air Force, and nine C-160Zs for the South African Air Force. Four C-160Fs were subsequently converted to the C-160P air mail transport aircraft configuration, and were operated by the national flag carrier Air France on behalf of the French Postal Service.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, p. 289. Production continued until October 1972. In July 1977, France placed an order for 25 C-160 aircraft, which were built to an improved standard.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, p. 285. Production work for this batch was split 50-50 between French aerospace company A√©rospatiale (the successor to Nord) and Germany aviation firm Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB) (which had absorbed VFW and HFB), while all aircraft were completed at a single assembly line in Toulouse. Changes from earlier aircraft include the cargo loading door on the port side of the fuselage being replaced by provision for additional fuel tanks in the wing centre section, as well as the installation of updated and improved avionics.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, pp. 286‚Äì287.

It is part of Oswego Community Unit School District 308, which also includes Oswego East High School. History The current Oswego High school building, built in 1964, is the third location of the high school. The former Oswego High School building became Traughber Junior High School. That building remained in use until the junior high moved to a new building in 2008. The old location now houses district offices. In the past decade, Oswego High School has undergone many additions to its existing location to accommodate such a fast-growing community. Academics In 2019, Oswego had an average SAT score of 515.4 for math and 515.3 for ELA, and graduated 96.4% of its senior class. In the same year, it received the \\"Commendable\\" designation from the Illinois State Board of Education, meaning the school had no underperforming student groups, maintained a graduation rate higher than 67% and had a performance that was not in the top 10% of schools statewide. Activities In 2005, the combined marching bands of Oswego High and Oswego East marched the 116th Tournament of Roses parade, the only band from Illinois to march at the event. OHS offers many co-curricular activities and clubs including six student band classes, several choirs, a drama club, and service organizations. Also available for students to join are organizations that compete in IHSA competitions such as a scholastic bowl team, a speech team, mathletes, WYSE Scholastic Team, and Horticulture/FFA.

The Inauguration of the First Philippine Republic in Malolos, January 23, 1899 The Philippine Republic (; ), more commonly known as the First Philippine Republic or the Malolos Republic, was a nascent revolutionary government in the Philippines. It was formally established with the proclamation of the Malolos Constitution on January 21, 1899, in Malolos, Bulacan, and endured until the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo by the American forces on March 23, 1901, in Palanan, Isabela, which effectively dissolved the First Republic. The First Philippine Republic was established after the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire (1896‚Äì1897) and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War between Spain and the United States (1898). Following the American victory at the Battle of Manila Bay, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines, issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898, and established a revolutionary Philippine government. In December 1898, Sovereignty over the Philippines was transferred from Spain to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris, making the United States formally the Philippines colonial power. The Malolos Constitution establishing the First Philippine Republic was proclaimed the following month. The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War began in February 1899, which the Philippine Republic lost. The Philippine Republic was the first constitutional republic in Asia.. (English translation by Sulpicio Guevara) Although there were several Asian republics predating the First Philippine Republic for example, the Mahajanapadas of ancient India, the Lanfang Republic, the Republic of Formosa or the Republic of Ezo, the Republic at Malolos was the first to frame a comprehensive constitution duly approved by a partially elected congress. History In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began against Spanish colonial rule. In 1897, Philippine forces led by Aguinaldo signed a ceasefire with the Spanish authorities and Aguinaldo and other leaders went into exile in Hong Kong. In April 1898, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out. The U.S. Navy's Asiatic Squadron, then in Hong Kong, sailed to the Philippines to engage the Spanish naval forces. On May 1, 1898, the U.S. Navy decisively defeated the Spanish Navy in the Battle of Manila Bay. Later in May, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines, established a dictatorial government on May 24, 1898 (formally established by decree on June 18), and on June 12, 1898, at Aguinaldo's ancestral home in Cavite, issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain. Following the proclamation of independence Aguinaldo established a revolutionary government on June 23, 1898, under which the partly-elected and partly-appointed Malolos Congress convened on September 15 to write a constitution. On December 10, 1898, the 1898 Treaty of Paris was signed, ending the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and transferring the Philippines from Spain to the United States. The Malolos Constitution written by the congress was proclaimed on January 22, 1899, creating what is known today as the First Philippine Republic, with Aguinaldo as its president. The constitution was approved by delegates to the Malolos Congress on January 20, 1899, and sanctioned by Aguinaldo the next day. The convention had earlier elected Aguinaldo president on January 1, 1899, leading to his inauguration on January 23. Parts of the constitution gave Aguinaldo the power to rule by decree. The constitution was titled \\"Constituci√≥n pol√≠tica\\", and was written in Spanish. =Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War= When the First Philippine Republic was constituted on January 22, 1899 in Malolos, that municipality became the seat of government of the Philippine Republic, and was serving as such when hostilities erupted between U.S. and Filipino forces in the Second Battle of Manila on February 4. On February 4, 1899, armed conflict erupted in Manila between Philippine Republic forces and American forces occupying the city subsequent to the conclusion of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. That day President Aguinaldo issued a proclamation ordering and commanding that \\"peace and friendly relations with the Americans be broken and that the latter be treated as enemies, within the limits prescribed by the laws of war.\\" The fighting quickly escalated into the Second Battle of Manila, with Philippine Republic forces being driven out of the city. American forces pushing north from Manila after the outbreak of fighting captured Caloocan on February 10. On March 29, as American forces threatened Malolos, the seat of government moved to San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. On March 31, American forces captured Malolos, the initial seat of the Philippine Republic government, which had been gutted by fires set by withdrawing Philippine Republic forces. Emilio Aguinaldo and the core of the revolutionary government had by then moved to San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. Peace negotiations with the American Schurman Commission during a brief ceasefire in April‚ÄìMay 1899 failed, and San Isidro fell to American forces on May 16.. The Philippine Republic core government had moved by then to Bamban, Tarlac, and subsequently moved to Tarlac town. Aguinaldo's party had already left Tarlac, the last capital of the Philippine Republic, by the time American troops occupied it on November13. American forces captured Calumpit, Bulacan on April 27 and, moving north, captured Apalit, Pampanga with little opposition on May 4 and San Fernando, Pampanga on May 5. This forced the seat of government to be shifted according to the demands of the military situation. In October 1899 American forces were in San Fernando, Pampanga and the Philippine Republic was headquartered not far north of there, in Angeles. On October 12, an American offensive to the north forced the Philippine Republic to relocate its headquarters in November to Tarlac, and then to Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. On November 13, under pressure by American forces, Aguinaldo and a party departed Bayombong by rail for Calasiao, Pangasinan, from where they immediately proceeded eastwards to Sta. Barbara in order to evade pursuing American forces. In Sta. Barbara, they joined a force of some 1200 armed men led by General Gregorio del Pilar. On November 13, in a conference in Bayambang, Pangasinan, Aguinaldo decided to disperse his army and begin guerrilla war. From that point on, distance and the localistic nature of the fighting prevented him from exercising a strong influence on revolutionary or military operations. Recognizing that American troops blocked his escape east, he turned north and west on November 15, crossing the mountains into La Union province.. Aguinaldo's party eluded pursuing American forces, passing through Tirad Pass near Sagada, Mountain Province where the Battle of Tirad Pass was fought on December 2 as a rear guard action to delay the American advance and ensure his escape. At the time of the battle, Aguinaldo and his party were encamped in Cervantes, about 10 km south of the pass. After being notified by a rider of the outcome of the battle and the death of del Pilar, Aguinaldo ordered that camp be broken, and departed with his party for Cayan settlement. Aguinaldo was captured by American forces on March 23, 1901 in Palanan, Isabela. Following his capture, Aguinaldo announced allegiance to the United States on April 1, 1901, formally ending the First Republic and recognizing the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines. Aguinaldo's party, traveling with del Pilar's force, reached Manaoag, Pangasinan on November 15. There, the force was split into vanguard and rear guard elements, with Aguinaldo and del Pilar in the vanguard. The vanguard force overnighted in Tubao, La Union, departed there on November 16, and was in Naguilian, La Union by November 19, where word was received that American forces had taken Santo Tomas and had proceeded to Aringay. Aguinaldo's force arrived in Balaoan, La Union on November 19, pushed on the next day, and arrived at the Tirad Pass, a natural choke point, on November 23. General del Pilar decided to place a blocking force in Tirad Pass to delay pursuing American forces while Aguinaldo's party moved on. The Battle of Tirad Pass took place on December 2, 1899. 52 men of del Pilar's 60-man force were killed, including del Pilar himself. However, the Filipinos under del Pilar held off the Americans long enough for Aguinaldo's party to escape. Aguinaldo, encamped with his party about 10 km south of the pass in Cervantes, Ilocos Sur, was apprised of the result of the battle by a rider, and moved on. The party reached Banane settlement on December 7, where Aguinaldo paused to consider plans for the future. On December 16, the party departed for Abra to join forces with General Manuel Tinio. The party traveled on foot through a pass at the summit of Mount Polis, and arrived at Ambayuan the next morning. The party pushed on to Banane, pursued closely by American forces. At this point, Aguinaldo's party consisted of one field officer, 11 line officers, and 107 men. The remainder of December 1899 was spent in continuous trek. The party was at the border of Abra and Cagayan provinces on Aguinaldo's 31st birthday on March 23, 1900. The trek from place to place continued until about May 22, 1900, when Aguinaldo established a new headquarters in Tierra Virgen. On August 27, 1900, after American forces landed at Aparri, Cagayan, Aguinaldo concluded that Tierra Virgan had become untenable as a headquarters and decided to march to Palanan, Isabela. On December 6, 1900, the party reached Dumasari, and arrived in Palanan the following morning. Aguinaldo remained in Palanan until his capture there by American forces with the aid of the native scouts on March 23, 1901. Organization =National cabinet= Article 73 of the constitution established a Council of Government (Cabinet), composed of a President and seven Secretaries. The following individuals were appointed to Cabinet positions: =Provincial and local government= Municipal and provincial governments under the Republic had quickly reorganized upon Aguinaldo's decrees of June 18 and 20, 1898. The Malolos Constitution cited on Article 82 the organization of provincial and popular assemblies which had the power of taxation. The government also claimed jurisdiction over the overseas territory of Palaos (Modern day Palau) and the Sulu archipelago. Both areas are represented in the Congress by representatives appointed by President Emilio Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo sent a letter to the Sultan of Sulu requesting that the islands be part of the First Philippine Republic, but the letter was ignored. It was reported in 2003 that Philippine congressman Harry Roque argued that Spain could not have legally ceded Palmas or any part of the Philippines to the United States because Filipinos had already established the Republic of the Philippines on June 12, 1898 before the Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10, 1898. =Judiciary= Provisional Law on the Judiciary was issued on March 7, 1899, in accordance to the provisions of the 1899 Malolos Constitution providing that the Chief Justice shall be chosen by the National Assembly with the concurrence of the president and secretaries of the government. Aguinaldo appointed Apolinario Mabini to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines on August 23, 1899; however, the appointment did not materialize because of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War.Blocked from being chief justiceHistory of the Supreme Court The Supreme Court included Gracio Gonzaga serving as President; Juan Arceo and Felix Ferrer as Chamber Presidents; and Deogracias Reyes, Juan Tongco, Pablo Tecson and Ygnacio Villamor serving as Associate Justices The Laws of the First Philippine Republic, Sulpicio Guevarra Finances The postage stamps of the Revolutionary Government. peso of the Revolutionary Government. One of the important laws passed by the Malolos Congress was the law providing for a national loan to buoy the national budget in which the Republic was trying to balance. The loan, worth 20 million pesos, was to be paid in 40 years with an annual interest of six percent. The law was decreed by Aguinaldo on November 30, 1898. Military When Philippine independence was declared on June 12, 1898, the Philippine Revolutionary Army was renamed the Philippine Republican Army. Aguinaldo then appointed Antonio Luna as Director or Assistant Secretary of War by September 28, 1898, and the Philippines first military school, the Academia Militar was established in Malolos. When the Republic was inaugurated on January 23, Luna had succeeded Artemio Ricarte as the Commanding General of the Republican Army. With such powers at hand, Luna attempted to transform the weak, undisciplined revolutionary army into a disciplined regular army for the service of the Republic.

The Georgia land lotteries were an early nineteenth century system of land redistribution in Georgia. Under this system, white male citizens could register for a chance to win lots of land that had (and in most cases recently) been forcibly taken from the Creek Indians and the Cherokee Nation. The lottery system was utilized by the State of Georgia between the years 1805 and 1833 ‚Äúto strengthen the state and increase the population in order to increase Georgia's power in the House of Representatives.‚Äù Although some other states used land lotteries, none were implemented at the scale of the Georgia contests. Land Spaces Land lots were surveyed in five different sizes based on the perceived quality of the land. In 1805, land lots were and . In 1807, land lots were . In 1820, land lots were and . In 1821, land lots were . In the 1832 Land Lottery area, land lots were , while in the 1832 Gold Lottery area, land lots were . History of system Prior to 1803, Georgia distributed land via a headright system. Though designed to prohibit corruption, the system actually encouraged it. During early administration, the government abused this system and created what today is generally known as the Yazoo land scandal. The much-abused \\"headright\\" system resulted in the adoption of the lottery system in May 1803, under governor John Milledge. The first lottery occurred in 1805. For each person subscribing to a lottery, a ticket was placed in the barrel or wheel. Since each lottery was over- subscribed, tickets were added to compensate for the over-subscription. 1830 map of the Cherokee Nation. In October 1831, Georgia voters went to the polls to vote between Governor George Gilmer who wished to reserve the Cherokee land, which contained several gold mines, for the State of Georgia, in order to pay for government projects and reduce taxes, and Wilson Lumpkin, who strongly supported giving away the lands (in what would become the State's last three land lotteries). Forced Relocation of Native Peoples Grant issued to a drawer in the Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832, which dispersed the former Cherokee property among the white settlers in Georgia. In an effort to keep their ancestral lands, certain Cherokees (and other interested parties)--including John Ross, Samuel Worcester and Major Ridge--took their fight against the State of Georgia to the United States Supreme Court. There were two major cases heard by the Court during the years of 1831 through 1832: Cherokee Nation v. Georgia and Worcester v. Georgia. Although the U.S. Supreme Court initially ruled against the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court later granted sovereignty in Worcester v. Georgia, resulting in the invalidation of the Indian Removal Act. U.S. President Andrew Jackson and the State of Georgia chose instead to ignore the Supreme Court ruling, a clearly unconstitutional action at least since the 1803 ruling in Marbury v. Madison. Georgia continued its surveying and division of the Cherokee lands through the final \\"1832 Land and Gold Lotteries.‚Äù President Jackson utilized the U.S. Army, forcing the \\"removal of the Cherokees. This was part of the ‚ÄúTrail of Tears,‚Äù which modern historians consider an ethnic cleansing or genocide. A volunteer soldier from Georgia who participated in the removal recounted: > I fought through the civil war and have seen men shot to pieces and > slaughtered by thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I > ever knew. Speculation Land speculation in the lotteries was common, many lots were sold sight-unseen by the winners for other lots or for gold. Real estate agents, individual citizens and even unscrupulous lottery officials attempted to secure promising gold belt lots or valuable Cherokee plantation lots. During the 1832 Lottery alone, some 85,000 people competed for 18,309 land lots to be given away, and at least 133,000 people competed for 35,000 gold belt lots to be given away. During the 28 years that the State of Georgia used the lottery system, the rules and the methods of the system remained virtually unchanged. Lottery fees depended on the winning ticket and the size of the lot won, but in general, they only covered the cost of running the lottery. The State did not directly profit from allocating these lands. Fractional lots were sold in each of the lotteries, and some lands, especially those near major rivers, were exempt from the lottery. These were distributed by the State at public auctions. Lotteries #1805 Land Lottery ‚Äî This encompassed Creek Indian lands just west of the Oconee River ceded to the state in 1802 and a small strip of land in the southeast section of the state. #1807 Land Lottery ‚Äî Included additional Creek lands. #1820 Land Lottery ‚Äî After the Creek War (1814), President Jackson demanded from the Creeks an immense area of land which would become the southern third of the entire state of Georgia. A second section of land in northeast Georgia was included. This other, smaller section defined the eastern end of the Cherokee Nation for 12 years. #1821 Land Lottery ‚Äî Further Creek cessions which included the future site of Atlanta. #1827 Land Lottery ‚Äî Signaled the end of the Creek Indians in Georgia. #1832 Land Lottery ‚Äî This lottery, along with the 1832 Gold Lottery, gave the Cherokee Nation to Georgia settlers. Sparked the \\"Trail of Tears.\\" #1832 Gold Lottery ‚Äî By the time of the gold lottery the Georgia Gold Rush was already beginning to wind down. The state did not guarantee that gold existed on the lots given away. #1833 Fractions Lottery ‚Äî The State of Georgia held one final land lottery in December, 1833, to distribute fractions from the Cherokee territory and other remaining lots not drawn in previous lotteries.

These letters are one of the first surviving documents from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Since they were sent to the Western Europe, the pope, merchants, and craftspeople, they were written in Latin. The first letter was written to Pope John XXII. Gediminas claimed that the Teutonic Knights did not act in the interest of the Catholic faith. Instead, they brutally devastated the land. The people were forced into resistance. Gediminas enumerated many crimes and damages done by the knights; for example, he claimed that his predecessor Vytenis sent a letter to the Franciscan friars asking for two brothers who could come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to look after a local church. When the Teutonic Knights learned about the letter, they sent their army and destroyed the church. In the last sentence Gediminas vaguely promised to accept Christianity and obey the pope. The second letter was written on January 25, 1323 to the German cities of L√ºbeck, Sund, Bremen, Magdeburg, Cologne and other cities in the Holy Roman Empire. Gediminas explained that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was very tolerant to the Christians, but remained pagan and did not accept Christianity only because of brutal Teutonic Knights. He told about the first letter sent to the pope and his intentions to baptize in the Catholic rite. Gediminas invited knights, squires, merchants, doctors, smiths, wheelwrights, cobblers, skinners, millers, and others to come to the Grand Duchy and practice their trade and faith without any restrictions. The peasants were promised tax exemption for ten years. The merchants were also exempt from any tariffs or taxes. This letter is best known because Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, was mentioned in written sources for the first time. Therefore, 1323 is considered to be the official founding year of Vilnius. Gediminas is considered to be the city's founder even though the city existed years before Gediminas' reign. Also, Vilnius is unambiguously mentioned as the capital city. His invitation notably included German Jews as well as Christians, and its issuance is closely linked to the establishment of the Jewish community in Lithuania. The third letter addressed to L√ºbeck, Rostock, Sund, Greifswald, Stetin, Gotland cities was written on May 26, 1323. In essence it repeated the second letter. It asked for various craftspeople (the list of crafts was expanded) to come to Lithuania and practice their trade. It said that there were three churches in the duchy: two Franciscan (in Vilnius and in Navahradak) and one Dominican. Everyone was free to use them. The fourth and the fifth letters were also written on May 26, 1323 and were addressed to the Franciscan and Dominican Orders. Gediminas, in anticipation of his baptism, invited priests and friars to come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also asked to spread the word to craftspeople that they were welcome in Lithuania. In the letter to the Dominicans, Gediminas mentioned that his seal was burned by the Teutonic Knights. The last surviving letter was written on September 22, 1324 and was addressed to the bishop of Tartu, Erzel, ruler of Tallinn land, and Council of Riga. It reported that the Teutonic Knights violated a peace treaty signed earlier. The Knights attacked border regions, killed residents, and took all valuables. Many messengers were captured and killed. Gediminas asked for help enforcing the treaty.

De Bary graduated from Columbia College in 1941, where he was a student in the first year of Columbia's famed Literature Humanities course. He then briefly took up graduate studies at Harvard University before the US entered World War II. De Bary left the academy to serve in American military intelligence in the Pacific Theatre. Upon his return, he resumed his studies at Columbia, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1953. He edited numerous books of original source material relating to East Asian (primarily Japanese and Chinese) literature, history, and culture, as well as making the case, in his book Nobility and Civility, for the universality of Asian values. He is recognized as essentially creating the field of Neo-Confucian studies. Life and career William Theodore \\"Ted\\" de Bary was born on August 9, 1919, in The Bronx, New York, and grew up in Leonia, New Jersey. De Bary's great-uncle was the German surgeon and botanist Anton de Bary, and his father William de Bary (1882‚Äì1963) immigrated to the U.S. from Germany in 1914. His parents divorced when he was a small child, and his mother raised him as a single mother. He formally changed his first name to \\"Wm.\\" to distinguish himself from his father. He entered Columbia University as an undergraduate student in 1937, and began studying Chinese the following year as a sophomore. After graduating in 1941, de Bary began graduate study in Chinese at Harvard University, but the following year he was recruited by the U.S. Navy to undergo intensive training in Japanese and serve as an intelligence officer in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. In 1947, de Bary left the military and returned to Columbia for graduate study in Chinese. He received an M.A. in 1948 followed by a Ph.D. in 1953 with a dissertation entitled \\"A Plan for the Prince: the Ming-i tai-fang lu of Huang Tsung-hsi\\", and became a professor immediately afterward. De Bary was active in faculty intervention during the Columbia University protests of 1968 and served as the university's provost from 1971 to 1978. He has attempted to reshape the Core Curriculum of Columbia College to include Great Books and classes devoted to non-Western civilizations. De Bary is additionally famous for rarely missing a Columbia Lions football game since he began teaching at the university in 1953. A recognized educator, he won Columbia's Great Teacher Award in 1969, its Lionel Trilling Book Award in 1983 and its Mark Van Doren Award for Great Teaching in 1987. In 2010 he received the Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement. De Bary served as the director of the Heyman Center for the Humanities and continued teaching until several months before his death in 2017 at age 97.

For four decades, he was a professor at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, where he was chair of the History Department for 18 years. He was editor of the Georgia Historical Quarterly for 50 years, and published 26 books on the American Civil War and Reconstruction. Background and early life Coulter was the son of the moderately wealthy John Ellis Coulter, a merchant and land speculator in the small town of Connelly Springs, North Carolina, in the western Piedmont. His father had hoped his son would go into the Lutheran ministry, but Coulter chose history instead. Both of Coulter's grandfathers served in the Confederate States Army. One fell in the Civil War while the other was a POW. During Reconstruction he was indicted for Ku Klux Klan- related violence and acquitted by an all-black jury.E. Merton Coulter, New Georgia Encyclopedia Coulter earned his undergraduate degree at the University of North Carolina (UNC), mentored by J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton, a prominent historian who emphasized how Southern whites had suffered under Reconstruction and the lack of readiness of freedmen and blacks for suffrage. In 1914 Coulter entered the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for graduate doctoral work, where he studied under additional professors sympathetic to Southern thinking about the Civil War and Reconstruction. Professional career After teaching briefly at Marietta College in Ohio, Coulter was hired by Georgia's flagship University of Georgia, where he was a professor for six decades. In 1940 he was selected as chair of the History Department, a position he held for 18 years. As a professor and writer, he influenced generations of historians. In addition, Coulter was editor of the Georgia Historical Quarterly for 50 years. A founding member of the Southern Historical Association, he served as its first president in 1934. In both writing and teaching, he was influential. The Library of Congress lists 50 books written or edited by Dr. Coulter. He published more than 125 articles, and wrote what for decades was the standard textbook for Georgia history. Coulter published books, often on forgotten and obscure people in Georgia history whose careers represented much about the state's development, such as his biographies of George Walton Williams, James Monroe Smith, Daniel Lee, Thomas Spalding, and many others. Similarly, works that he did on the now dead towns of Auraria and Petersburg discovers historical context within community. His work in professionally documenting historical truth behind local legend illustrated the scholarly value of legend shown in his work The Toombs Oak, the Tree that Owned Itself, and other Chapters of Georgia (1966). According to the New Georgia Encyclopedia, \\"Coulter emerged as a leader of that generation of white southern historians who viewed the South's past with pride and defended its racist policies and practices. He framed his literary corpus to praise the Old South, glorify Confederate heroes, vilify northerners, and denigrate southern blacks.\\" Reassessment In the late 20th century, historians described Coulter's books as \\"historical apologies justifying Southern secession, defending the Confederate cause, and condemning Reconstruction.\\" In this, he had absorbed ideas of his professor J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton at UNC, as well as views commonly shared by whites in the South. In the mid-20th century, people used Coulter's \\"intellectual paradigm\\" about Southern black failures as justification for maintaining Jim Crow segregation and opposing civil rights reform.Bailey, 2001 Historian Eric Foner wrote: \\"Anti-Reconstruction scholars faithfully echoed Democratic propaganda of the post-Civil War years. 'The Negroes,' wrote E. Merton Coulter in 1947, 'were fearfully unprepared to occupy positions of rulership,' and black officeholding was 'the most spectacular and exotic development in government in the history of white civilization...(and the) longest to be remembered, shuddered at, and execrated.'\\"Eric Foner, Freedom's Lawmakers: A Directory Of Black Officeholders During Reconstruction, New York: Oxford University Press, 1993; Revised, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1996, p. xii Foner also wrote that as late as 1968, Coulter was: \\"The last wholly antagonistic scholar of the era, described Georgia's most prominent Reconstruction black officials as swindlers and 'scamps', and suggested that whatever positive qualities they possessed were inherited from white ancestors.\\"Foner, Freedom's Lawmakers, p. xiiE.
