It is found in India. Some authors consider this as a subspecies of Pareronia valeria. Description Male in Karnataka, India Female, common form, in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala Female, philomela form Male upperside: ground colour a clear pale blue of a much deeper tint than in P. avatar, Moore; all the veins defined with black. Forewing: costa broadly, apex and terminal margin very broadly black, this black on the termen narrowed towards the tornus, and traversed by a transverse subterminal series of bluish-white spots that are variable in number; the spot in interspace 3 shifted inwards; sometimes the posterior two spots of the series are all but joined onto the streaks of the ground colour between the veins. Hindwing: dorsal and costal margins broadly whitish: terminal margin broadly black, especially at apex, the black area covered, except at the tornus, with specialised opaque-looking scales. Underside: paler blue, the terminal margins of the wings obscurely fuscous, traversed by a subterminal, very indistinct, transverse series of whitish lunulated spots. Forewing: the veins more or less broadly bordered with black, this edging broadened towards the termen; apex broadly, terminal margin decreasingly to the tornus, suffused with a somewhat obscure pearly-while lustre. Hindwing: the subcostal vein and veins 6, 7, and 8 broadly, the rest of the veins very narrowly edged with black; a very fine black line in interspace 1. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings very narrow and white. Antennae black, head, thorax and abdomen fuscous, the thorax clothed with long bluish hairs; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen pale silvery bluish white. Female: Female dimorphs Common form. Upperside: black; the markings bluish white. Forewing: cell with two streaks, the anterior one from the extreme base, the posterior one from the end of the basal third, but extending beyond the anterior streak; below and beyond the cell is a series of streaks in the interspaces; the streaks very irregular in length, that in interspace 1 the longest, angulated anteriorly and divided longitudinally from near its base, the streak in interspace 3 short and broad forming an elongate spot, those in the anterior interspaces more or less obliquely placed; beyond these streaks follows a subterminal transverse series of spots, of which the spot in interspace 3 is shifted inwards and those opposite the apex curved backwards. Hindwing: costa and dorsum broadly white; cell and the interspaces beyond with a series of streaks and sub-terminal spots, more or less as in the forewing but more regular; the streak in cell and interspace 1 divided longitudinally, the subterminal series of spots evenly curved. Underside: similar to the upperside, but the ground colour dull, dusky and diffuse, the markings broader but less clearly defined; the apical area on the forewing obscured by a powdering of whitish scales. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen much as in the male but darker. Philomela form. Very like the first, the markings both on the upper and undersides similar, but the ground colour on the upperside of the hindwing at base of interspace 1a, over the whole of interspace 1, area of cell and at base of interspace 2 suffused with bright yellow. On the underside the same areas are dull ochraceous. The extent of the bright yellow colour on the upperside and of the dull ochraceous tint on the underside is variable, in some specimens more restricted, in others it spreads further towards the costa.the common form of female mimics glassy tiger to avoid predation. the philomela form is rare and identified by yellow colouration at the base of the wings. this form is reported more in north-east India. According to Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth this form mimics Danais aspasia, which is not found west of Myanmar. He rejects the assumption that the wagtail carries the eggs of D. aspasia to India. It seems that in bygone era the D. aspasia might have been found in India in the past along with the common wanderer and later eliminated.

Although the name of the company changed a couple of times, the cars were branded with the Stabilia name throughout this period. The company specialised in lowered cars featuring a special patented type of suspension. History of the business An automobile constructor named Vrard who had previously worked both for L√©on Boll√©e and for De Dion-Bouton prepared his own prototype and presented it at the Paris Motor Show in 1904. However, it was not till 1907 that Vrardy founded his own auto-making business under the name Automobiles Stabilia and located at Neuilly-sur-Seine. In 1911 the company mutated into Giraldy et Vrard, although the cars continued to carry the Stabilia name. Automobile manufacture now took place both at Neuilly-sur- Seine and at premises in nearby Asni√®res-sur-Seine. The company name changed again, to Vrard et Cie, in 1920, but the cars continued to be presented under the name Stabilia. During the 1920s, by now with just the single production site at Asni√®res the volumes produced declined, and production ended altogether in 1930. The cars The first production model, produced for 1908, was powered by a four-cylinder engine of 2200cc. The car featured an ‚Äúunderslung‚Äù chassis (with the axles protruding from above the principal longitudinal chassis elements and not, as was more normal at the time, with the principal chassis elements all mounted above the axles). This provided for a lowered car body that would remain a key element in the appeal of Stabilias. . Between 1912 and 1914 the manufacturer broadened its range, offering cars of 1500cc, 1700cc and 2700cc engine capacity. Production resumed after the war in 1919, and at the Motor Show in October 1919 the company exhibited a 15HP 4-cylinder powered car with 3168cc of engine displacement and the choice of a or wheelbase. The car was priced by the manufacturer at 20,000 francs in bare chassis form. There was also a 14HP model with a 2800cc engine and a four speed transmission. In 1924 Stabilia still appeared at the Motor show, attracting comment with the car‚Äôs low-slung chassis. Between 1924 and 1926 Stabilia was offering cars with bought in engines of 1500cc or 2000cc. From 1927 a few smaller cars were marketed in collaboration with or under license from Automobiles Gobron. The last car, in 1930, was powered by a straight- eight engine of just 1400cc.

He was elected as M.L.A. from Ichagarh constituency and Member of Bihar Legislative Council. He was a member of All India Congress Committee (AICC).  Early life  Dhananjay Mahato was born on 8 August 1919 in a Kudumi Mahato family to Kshetra Mohan Mahato and Ratuli Devi in Gunda, a small village located in the Singhbhum District of Jharkhand (erstwhile Bihar, British India). Since childhood he was sagacious towards education. He completed his primary education in the village school and later for higher education he attended Lakhanpur High School in Purulia District of West Bengal. Soft-Spoken Dhananjay was gentle amongst the schoolmates and his fellow countrymen but at the same time he was a strong protester of the British Raj.  Revolutionary  During the school days he came under the influence of well renowned freedom fighter of the region Bheem Chandra Mahato who gave him initiation and motivated towards the freedom struggle. In 1935, at the age of 16 he joined the Freedom struggle movement. Together with his revolutionary team he started campaigning for the awareness among the people to launch an agitation against the British government. In April, 1936 he sustained serious injuries by the police while preparing for the rally to boycott the British products in Purulia Town (West Bengal).This incident didn‚Äôt shattered him instead he turned more seditious and participated with more energy and enthusiasm in the freedom struggle movement. In September 1942, when the Quit India Movement was already launched, a group of 21 revolutionaries led by Bheem Chandra Mahato and Dhananjay Mahato set ablaze the British flag and later the BaraBazar police station. Held on this charge he got arrested by the British on 3 October 1942 and remained imprisoned until 17 April 1943 in Purulia Jail.

Post-Independence  After the independence of India he totally devoted himself towards the social service for the region. In 1956 Dhananjay Mahato led a large movement against the States Reorganisation Act when Manbhum district was partitioned between Bihar and West Bengal. After joining Indian National Congress Party, in 1957 he was elected as MLA from Ichagarh Vidhan Sabha and in 1976 he became member of Bihar Legislative Council (MLC).

Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, Illinois. Designed by David Adler, the Georgian Revival mansion was commissioned by future United States Representative Charles S. Dewey. History Charles S. Dewey, a real estate developer who would later be elected to the United States House of Representatives, commissioned David Adler to design the building in 1913. Dewey came to know Adler as he designed houses for two family friends. It was built down the road from the Naval Station Great Lakes, where Dewey was stationed during World War I. Dewey named the house \\"Over Yonder\\" and requested that it be designed in the Georgian Revival style. Completed in 1914, the Dewey family lived in the mansion until 1918.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201514.pdf While Dewey was stationed aboard the USS Mississippi, his house was claimed by the government through eminent domain in an effort to expand the naval base. Dewey's wife was forced to evacuate the house by the end of the year. In 1921, the Deweys were awarded a compensation of $192,950 for the acquisition of the land. Later that year, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs was established and, on April 17, 1924, the property was transferred to the agency. When the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center was established, the Dewey House became known as Building 29 on the campus. The hospital split the former Dewey House into ten apartments for personnel. The National Park Service determined that Dewey House was eligible for the National Register of Historic Places on August 8, 1980. The building was listed on the register on May 8, 1985.

Heineken House gets its name from mayor Christian Abraham Heineken, an early owner. In 1803 Bremen was divided into four areas and each of these had a mayor. Heineken was one of those mayors who became involved in the defortification of the town.

It takes its name from the Hollins Market, the oldest public market building still in use in Baltimore City, which is located in the heart of the neighborhood. Like the adjacent neighborhood Pigtown, Hollins Market has long been considered one of Baltimore's most promising neighborhoods because of its proximity to University of Maryland, Baltimore Medical Center, the Interstate 95 business corridor, Camden Yards, Ravens Stadium, the Inner Harbor, and Downtown Baltimore. Major construction projects such as the University of Maryland Biopark and the pending renovation of the Lion Bros. factory have brought increased attention to the neighborhood. Similar to Pigtown, Hollins Market has a diverse mix of UMMC students, blue collar workers, artists, and commuters to Fort George G. Meade. Hollins Market is also home to the Sowebo Arts and Music Festival which draws hundreds of art and music lovers to the neighborhood every Memorial Day Weekend. Landmarks and attractions The neighborhood's most significant landmark is the Hollins Market, a two block long structure consisting of space for market stalls, a civic auditorium, and meeting rooms. On the adjacent streets are a variety of locally owned shops and restaurants. The Lithuanian Hall (Baltimore, Maryland) is located near the neighborhood's eastern boundary. It is a private club that hosts community dances and other events. Like Mobtown Ballroom in Pigtown, it is known for drawing an eclectic crowd for its lively nightlife and cheap drinks. The B&O; Railroad Museum forms part of the south boundary of the neighborhood. Within Hollins Market itself, is the Irish Shrine and Railroad Workers Museum.Irish Railroad Workers Museum; Baltimore, Maryland Five small community parks are located within the Hollins Market neighborhood: Carlton Street Park, Little Lithuania Park, Schroeder and Lombard Streets Park, Boyd Street Garden and the B.& O.

The neighborhood of Hollins Market, as well as the market building, were named for the Hollins Family, who previously extensively owned the property west of downtown Baltimore during the early 19th Century where the neighborhood is now located. Hollins Market is predominantly residential, with a commercial district surrounding the market building and along West Baltimore Street.

The first prototype MAZ-500 ran as early as 1955 and they were shown to the public in 1958. Delays in engine development pushed full production back to 1965, although limited production started in 1963. The MAZ-500 is a cab over truck instead of the MAZ-200's conventional layout. This was done to increase payload and reduce weight as well as reduce fuel consumption. The engine itself was quite modern, a direct injection diesel V6 built by the Yaroslavl Motor Plant (who had also originally developed the preceding MAZ-200 truck) with at 2100 rpm. The truck's design was also innovative, with a tilting cabin which was still rare in the West as well. It also had a number of features designed to make the truck operable under the arduous conditions found in Siberia. The MAZ-500/500A was in production from 1963 (with full production commencing in 1965) until 1977 with modernizations taking place in 1970 and 1977. The tractor-trailer versions MAZ-514, -515, and -516 continued to be built as late as 1981, with the same upgrades as the succeeding MAZ-5335.

His disease worsens steadily with age, but modern medicine lengthens his life expectancy. Over the years, doctors tell Juan's mother, Eleonora, that her son will most likely die by the age of eighteen. Knowing that he could die at any moment, Juan decides to live every day of his life to the fullest.

It explores Mangan's ideas on fate and destiny as he's about to perform in his biggest performance to date, a sold out show at the Vancouver, British Columbia Orpheum. It premiered on CBC Television on August 25, 2012. The film was directed and produced by Brent Hodge and Jon Siddall. It was nominated for a Leo Award in 2013. Synopsis The film starts by introducing Dan Mangan, a singer-songwriter from Vancouver, who has built his reputation through continuous touring, with and without a backing band. He counters those who say that \\"making it in life has everything to do with luck\\" with a quote from his father, that those who work the hardest tend to be the luckiest. The film interleaves the build up to the show at the Orpheum with footage from a poker game with drummer Kenton Loewen, and guitarist Gordon Grdina as well as Dan's then fiancee (now wife) Kirsten Slenning, and Dan, as they discuss the upcoming show, the end of their current 42 show tour, creativity, the past, and life after playing the Orpheum(a lifelong goal of Dan's). It also contains some behind the scenes footage of the filming of the music video for the song About As Helpful As You Can Be Without Being Any Help At All off his album Oh Fortune directed by Stuart Gillies. The main theme of the movie is how stardom doesn't happen over night. That it's a slow progression of winning over a fan, one at a time, through hard work and touring. It also touches on the fleeting nature of fame, and impermanence of art. The movie concludes with the opening of the show, a few small clips of the performance, and then the band and accompanying orchestra bowing on stage, begging the question, what happens next?

The importance of the vase lies in the fact that it is one of the oldest metal objects to be decorated in this fashion on the Indian Subcontinent. Since 1880, the vase has been part of the British Museum's Asian collection.British Museum Collection British Museum Highlights Discovery Although originally thought to come from Kulu, the vase was discovered in 1857 near the Gandhola Monastery, about 18 km from Keylong in Lahaul, Himachal Pradesh. A landslip had exposed an ancient Buddhist cell which had been lying dormant for over 1,500 years. The vase was eventually acquired by Major Hay, the local political agent of the British Raj, who donated it to the India Museum in London. In 1880 the vase, like many other items in the India Museum, was transferred to the British Museum. Description The Kulu Vase is spherical in shape with a high neck and wide rim which is partly damaged. The frieze on the vase illustrates a courtly figure or monarch who heads a chariot procession. Bestriding a chariot pulled by four horses, he is closely followed by a line of cavalry and another royal personage riding an elephant. At the end of the procession two female musicians are playing a flute and harp. The neck of the vase is decorated with a range of different patterns including chevrons and parallel lines. Without any inscriptions or local context to the find, it is difficult to determine the significance and meaning of the characters and ceremony portrayed on the vase.

He was Minister of Agriculture and Commerce in the government of Napoleon III in 1869. Early years Alfred Le Roux was born in Paris, France, on 11 December 1852, son of a banker. As a young man he wrote poetry, dedicating some verses to the exiled Henri, Count of Chambord, pretender to the French throne. He published a volume of Poems in 1842, the novel Edouard Aubert in 1843 and a short story Henriette published in the Revue des Deux- mondes in 1844. He then took charge of his father's house. His position in the world of business brought him a seat on the board of the Chemins de fer de l'Ouest in 1864. He was made chairman of the board of directors of the Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale pour le d√©veloppement du commerce et de l'industrie. He was a wealthy landowner in the Vend√©e, and was elected General Counsel of that Department, representing Saint-Michel-en-l'Herm. He often presided over the council. Political career For his monetary assistance to Prince Louis Napoleon while the latter was president, Le Roux was chosen on 29 February 1852 as the government candidate for the legislature in the 2nd district of the Vend√©e. He was elected and joined the majority who voted for the restoration of the Second French Empire, and was constantly in favor of Napoleon's dynastic rights. Apart from this, he was mainly involved in business issues, where his competence was widely recognized. Le Roux was a good speaker, and was often the secretary and rapporteur of the budget committee. He was reelected with the official support of the government on 22 June 1857, 1 June 1863 and 24 May 1869. He was vice-president of the legislative body in 1863 and again in the short session of June 1869. Le Roux was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Commerce on 14 July 1869, in a cabinet charged with modifying the imperial constitution. He and all his colleagues left office before the new ministry headed by √âmile Ollivier was formed in January 1870. He was among those who voted for war with Prussia at the start of the Franco-Prussian War. He was charged by the House on 4 September 1870 to see General Louis-Jules Trochu and advise him to save the dynasty, but he said of his mission that it was too late. Later years Le Roux returned to private life with the fall of the empire. In the elections of 14 October 1877 he was the official candidate of the government of Marshal MacMahon in the 2nd district of Fontenay-le-Comte. He was elected as a deputy and sat in the right-wing bonapartist group l'Appel au peuple. However, the election was later invalidated and he was not returned on the second ballot. He was made Commander of the Legion of Honour on 13 August 1864 and Grand Officer of the Order on 13 August 1868. His daughter married the Count of la Grange. Alfred Le Roux died in Paris on 1 June 1880.

It is located at the Mississauga Civic Centre right on Celebration Square across from Square One Mall. The Gallery is open every day and offers free admission and guided exhibition tours in addition to regular art social events, workshops for adult learners, and youth programmes for schools, universities and community groups. The Gallery holds approximately 18 exhibitions a year on a rotating basis. History In 2013, the AGM hired artist Camille Turner to be Mississauga's first ever Artist in Residence. Turner was interested in the hidden histories of Mississauga. Her projects for the AGM included the (un)settler Community Journal Project and the 5&Dime; walking tour, exploring strip malls as cultural spaces. In 2014, the AGM launched an extensive re-branding campaign, characterized by a new design created by The White Room in Toronto. This campaign has received international recognition in design magazines, and a finalist in the Graphis 2015 annual design competition. Permanent Collection The AGM's Permanent Collection numbers over 500 works by regional and national artists. In 2013, the AGM launched a digital archiving project, funded by the Museums Assistance Program and the Museums and Technology Fund, which created an accessible online database launched on the AGM website in 2014. Because of space limitations, the Gallery had a moratorium on collecting since 2008. In 2014, the AGM presented a new collections policy, focusing on digital and lens-based works, with a particular focus on regional artists, iconic Canadian works and works by artists representing the social fabric of Mississauga. The AGM's Permanent Collection was made accessible on an online archive in December 2014. Expansion Long considered \\"the best kept secret in Mississauga\\" due to the lack of visibility of its location inside the Civic Centre,\\"Art Gallery of Mississauga facing identity crisis\\". Brampton Guardian. in 2011 the AGM commissioned Lord Cultural Resources to conduct a facility expansion plan, with the objective of potentially moving the gallery into a new building to increase visibility and exhibition space. The Lord Cultural study reported that, despite being in the sixth largest city in Canada, the AGM was the smallest public art gallery. In June 2014, past AGM Director  Curator Stuart Keeler and Board President Mike Douglas appeared before Mississauga City Council to request support for a facility expansion. Gallery visitors grew from just under 19,000 in 2011 to over 30,000 in 2013. Options presented include an expansion of the AGM's current facility in City Hall and a new home in the Living Arts Centre across the street. City Council was supportive of the request, and asked staff to examine feasibility. Roots and Branches  Education The AGM acquired a grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation to fund educational and engagement programming from 2013 ‚Äì 2014. Roots and Branches is a comprehensive, hands-on approach to learning that facilitates free visits by Artists in Residence, who collaborate with Teachers to deliver lesson plans and visual art-inspired activities that extend standardized curriculum, while exposing students to critical processes in contemporary artistic practice. The programme as well provides free Tours of the Gallery with free Bus Transit to and from the school site and the Art Gallery of Mississauga.

The poster tag line read: \\"tortured by desires his vows forbid... master of a house of mortal sin!\\" Plot Troubled young Jenny (Susan Penhaligon) enters the confessional of her local church, and bares her soul to elderly priest Father Meldrum (Anthony Sharp). Apparently obsessed with her, Meldrum begins to stalk the distressed Jenny and blackmail her with a tape recording of her confession. Seeing himself as the dispenser of \\"divine justice\\", Meldrum tortures his victims with guilt, murdering those in his way with such diverse means as incense burners and poisoned holy wafers.

Having the villainous murderer a repressed and crazed Catholic priest in modern times brought a new and different kind of monster to the catalog of British horror, and he‚Äôs marvelously played by Anthony Sharp.

Reis, DVD Drive-In * \\"Much criticism has been leveled against this film for its unabashed attacks on Catholicism, but it's really Walker's trademark amoral approach to filmmaking that elicits a strong urge to take a hot bath after viewing.\\" ~ Cavett Binion, Allmovie *\\"a disappointment, although it has its moments...The script relies too much on mild sacrilege for its effects, instead of concentrating on more interesting aspects of religious repression.\\" ~ Time Out *\\"I ended up being quite impressed with this one; it's one of those horror movies that tries to be about something more than just scaring people.\\" ~ Dave Sindelar, Fantastic Movie Musings & Ramblings *\\"the way the creepier, suffocating aspects of religion are brought out is bold and effective. As a whole, it's a callous, low budget and grey-toned work, but stays with the viewer longer than slicker horrors then or since.\\" ~ Graeme Clark, The Spinning Image *\\"well-executed and maintains a dark interest throughout, supported by interesting performances (especially Sheila Keith as Meldrum's devoted love).\\" ~ The Terror Trap *\\"Walker fails to bring any sensibility, other than the merely exploitative, to the grotesque material, this must be considered pretty irredeemable stuff, even for a horror film.\\" ~ TV Guide *\\"there are more pros than con with \\"House of Mortal Sin,\\" but Walker feels constipated with this effort, unsure if he wants to court controversy or make a cracking chiller.\\" ~ Brian Orndorf, Blu-Ray.com *\\"A hugely underrated shocker from cult director Pete Walker, who alone saved the British cinema of the 1970s from complete terror blandness with a series of Home County horrors that included House of Whipcord and Frightmare.

Johnson had been a journeyman fighter through most of his professional career and though he had nine losses on his record, he nevertheless was able to land an IBF light heavyweight title match against Clinton Woods. The two fighters fought to a draw in their first fight on November 7, 2003, but Johnson was able to pick up the unanimous decision victory in the second. Despite his status as champion, Johnson came into the fight as an overwhelming underdog with Jones being a 6‚Äì1 favorite by the time of the fight. The Fight Johnson would dominate Jones for much of the fight, serving as the aggressor for the duration of the fight and constantly having Jones on the defensive against the ropes. Johnson would connect with 118 of his 437 thrown punches while Jones, though landing at a slightly higher percentage (28% to Johnson's 27%), only threw 270 punches, 75 of which landed. The fight would come to an end 48 seconds into round nine. Johnson connected with a strong overhand right followed by a short left hook that dropped Jones to the canvas where the back of his head hit the canvas hard.

He was the biological father of Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, although Welby did not learn this until paternity testing taken after Sir Anthony's death. Early life Montague Browne was the son of Andrew Duncan Montague Browne (1878‚Äì1969), a British army colonel, by his marriage to Violet Evelyn Downes (1883‚Äì1969). He was educated in Switzerland, and then at Stowe School where he refused to join the OTC until World War II broke out in September 1939. Second World War RAF service In September 1941 Montague Browne went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, but left in spring 1942 to join the Royal Air Force. After learning to fly in a de Havilland Tiger Moth with No. 9 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Ansty near Coventry, he was sent to train in the United States via Canada. He graduated as a fighter pilot with the US Navy pilots school, and returned to the UK, training to fly the Bristol Beaufighter with the RAF. After assignment to squadrons flying in Egypt, Palestine and Cyprus, he was assigned to 211 Squadron RAF at Chiringa in Arakan, on the Burma-Bengal border. In 1945 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his skill and valour attacking Imperial Japanese Army lines of communication within occupied Burma.Browne, Anthony Montague, Long Sunset: Memoirs of Winston Churchill's Last Private Secretary London 1995 Chapter 3 Anthony Montague Browne at Winston Churchill.org Retrieved 9 April 2016 At the end of May 1945 he was promoted a flight lieutenant. Foreign Office After returning to Magdalen College, Oxford, for a year, Montague Browne entered the Foreign Office in 1946.The London Gazette, 13 May 1949 His first post was as private secretary to the then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Orme ‚ÄúMoley‚Äù Sargent. After a period as the Foreign Office resident clerk (the political night duty officer), he was assigned to the Western Union Secretariat, which led the UK drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty. In November 1949 he was posted to the British Embassy in Paris, France, in part due to his good French language skills which were developed during his schooling in Switzerland. Montague Browne was second secretary in the Chancery (political section), responsible for monitoring North Africa, covering Egypt to Tangier. With the French sceptical of Anglo-American intentions in North Africa, and French internal politics dominated at the time with the rise in electoral power of the French Communist Party, Montague Browne was chosen by the then British Ambassador to France, Sir Oliver Harvey, to do the internal political reporting of French concerns. Churchill's private secretary In September 1952, Montague Browne was chosen to be Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Till 1955 the role was undertaken jointly with Jock Colville.Colville, John, The Fringes of Power (W.W. Norton & Company 1985), p. 632. When Churchill retired in 1955, Montague Browne briefly returned to the Foreign Office but in the same year was seconded to continue as Churchill's private secretary. He stayed with Churchill for the rest of Churchill's life. At first, Churchill was doubtful of him, observing, \\"I dare say we will get on very well together.\\" As well as his duties as a chief of staff, Montague Browne lunched and dined with Churchill and provided an opponent for his favourite card game, rubicon (six pack bezique). He also accompanied him on his trips abroad. After Churchill's fall in Monaco in June 1962 when he broke his hip, Montague Browne arranged and accompanied him on the RAF flight back to London to assure, as Churchill wished, that if he died he would die in England.Croft, Rodney, Churchill's Final Farewell: The State and Private Funeral of Sir Winston Churchill It was Montague Brown who signed as witness Churchill's death certificate on 24 January 1965 and then liaised between his family and the government regarding Churchill's funeral arrangements. Post-Churchill Following Churchill's death Montague Browne was seconded to the Royal Household (1965‚Äì67). He then worked for companies in the City of London, including International Life Insurance and Gerrard and National. He also served as a trustee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust in the UK. In 1988 he made an extended appearance on the television discussion programme After Dark alongside among others David Irving, Lord Hailsham and Jack Jones. The topic under discussion was \\"Winston Churchill: Hero or Madman\\". It was stated in the programme introduction that this was the first time Montague Browne had \\"spoken at length about Winston Churchill\\" [in public]. Montague Browne's memoir of his time with Churchill, published originally in 1995, offered further affectionate, if carefully discreet, insights into the statesman's final years. Personal life Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury Montague Browne married twice. His first marriage, in 1950 (dissolved 1970), took place in Cheltenham and was to Noel ‚ÄúNonie‚Äù Arnold-Wallinger. He had one daughter from his first marriage. He married secondly, towards the end of 1970 in Wandsworth, Shelagh Macklin (n√©e Mulligan), the former wife of racing driver Lance Macklin. While working for Churchill, Montague Browne had an affair with Jane Gillian Portal (born 1929), one of Churchill's personal secretaries, from 1949 until her marriage to Gavin Welby on 4 April 1955. (Jane Portal later married Charles Williams.) In 2016, DNA tests showed he was the biological father of her son, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was born on 6 January 1956. Montague Browne died at his home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire, on 1 April 2013. A memorial service was held on 25 June 2013 at St Clement Danes Church on the Strand, London.

Located in Santa Barbara, it is also one of the largest healthcare providers on the south and central coast of California. The Sansum Clinic was established by William Sansum, the first physician to develop and administer insulin in the U.S. to successfully treat a diabetic patient. The clinic expanded to treat other patients who did not require hospitalization. As of May 2013, Sansum Clinic's approximately 1,200 physicians, staff and scientists represent more than 30 medical specialties and subspecialties at 23 patient care locations. History The Sansum Clinic is an umbrella name for two of the oldest clinics in the area: the Sansum Medical Clinic and the Santa Barbara Medical Clinic. The two clinics merged in 1998 as the Sansum-Santa Barbara Medical Foundation Clinic; in 2006, it was renamed Sansum Clinic. The Cancer Center of Santa Barbara joined the Sansum Clinic as the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara with Sansum Clinic in 2012. =Sansum Medical Clinic= In 1920, William Sansum (1880-1948) arrived in Santa Barbara, California to serve as head of the Potter Metabolic Clinic. This clinic was founded in 1916 in a New York City Hospital to serve patients with diabetes, nephritis and gout. The Potter Clinic was largely funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and in 1919 was moved to Santa Barbara. Sansum specialized in diabetes, a fatal disease at the time. It was the subject of Sansum‚Äôs doctoral thesis, and the related theme in nearly twenty scholarly papers he wrote in eight years. In May 1922, Sansum became the first physician to develop and administer insulin in the U.S. to successfully treat a diabetic patient. He also developed methods to obtain a higher yield of insulin from raw material. Sansum established the Sansum Medical Clinic in 1928 to treat health problems of patients (who did not require hospitalization) with the latest research and medical advances at the time. The Sansum Medical Clinic focused on clinical specialization, assessment and treatment and research. The clinic attracted out-of-town and out-of-state patients, especially those with diabetes, in need of specialized medical services. =Santa Barbara Medical Clinic= The Santa Barbara Clinic was established in 1921 as one of the earliest multi-specialty group medical practices in the nation. Rexwald Brown headed the new clinic. He was influenced by watching the collaborative process of physicians in World War I, observing physicians, each with a different specialty, operating together to diagnose and treat the wounded soldiers efficiently. He brought the same process to a civilian setting. He felt specialists could remain current in their own field, and work collaboratively with other specialists to provide the best resources and knowledge to help a patient. This new concept gained acceptance and continued to grow; physicians were added every year as the need for different specialists was recognized. This was in contrast to the traditional role of clinics at that time which were defined as hospital-based research-oriented facilities, treating patients with specific ailments. =Cancer Center of Santa Barbara= The Cancer Center of Santa Barbara was formed in 1950 with the donation of funds to purchase a one-million-volt x-ray machine. In 1949, Lillian Converse was treated for terminal cancer. Though she died, her husband Elisha Converse donated the funds for her doctor, Henry Ullmann, to purchase the x-ray machine in the memory of his wife; it was one of seven in the United States used to treat cancer at the time. Through the contributions of families and charities, the non-surgical and outpatient center committed itself to advancing the understanding, diagnosis, treatment, cure and prevention of cancer. In 2012 the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara merged with Sansum Clinic to become the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara with Sansum Clinic. Current practice More than 180 physicians representing more than 30 specialties are affiliated with Sansum Clinic. The clinic sees more than 150,000 patients (500,000 patient visits) per year and draws patients from all around the country, primarily serving patients throughout Santa Barbara County and the surrounding counties of Ventura, Los Angeles, Kern and San Louis Obispo. The non-profit clinic offers health education throughout Santa Barbara and wellness programs and services at a reduced price or free, as well as a day camp for children with chronic asthma at no charge. =Locations= Sansum Clinic operates patient care facilities in Carpinteria, Santa Barbara, Goleta, Solvang, Lompoc and Santa Maria. In addition to the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara with Sansum Clinic, It also operates centers for specific medical specialties, such as the Travel & Tropical Medicine Center, Bariatric Surgery Center, Eye Care Center, Laser Eye Care Center, Facial Plastic Surgery and Aesthetics, Doctors‚Äô Weight Management Program and Premier Physical Program. It is also building a new ambulatory surgical center (ASC) in Santa Barbara which was scheduled to open in 2014. It is also one of the biggest employers in Santa Barbara.City of Santa Barbara CAFR Innovations Sansum Clinic was the first place in the United States where insulin was developed and successfully administered to treat diabetes. Sansum Clinic was among the earliest multi-specialty group practices established in the nation. Erno Daniel was among the first physicians in the United States to be certified in the medical specialty of geriatric medicine. Internist Paul Linaweaver came in with a specialization in undersea medicine and was Director of the West Coast Center for the National Diving Accident Network (now Divers Alert Network). Casimir Domz, performed the first successful bone marrow transplant in a patient with an immune deficiency. The studies on diet and nutrition by Alfred Koehler, focused on the role fat and cholesterol play in degenerative diseases and were 20 years ahead of their time in showing a relationship between cholesterol and arteriosclerosis.

The film was directed by journalist Sara Terry and it premiered at the South by Southwest film festival. The title of the film is the organization's name, which translates to \\"family talk\\" in the Krio language. The film has received mixed reviews from critics. An epilogue to the film documented the community's reconciliation process with one of the major perpetrators of violence during the war. Background The film covers the process of reconciliation among community members that have been affected by the Sierra Leone Civil War. The war lasted from 1991 and 2002, as three factions warred for control of the struggling nation. Sierra Leoneans were often forced into service with rebel forces and made to commit acts of atrocity against their neighbors in the community. A United Nations Development Programme publication estimates at least 70,000 deaths and 2.6 million people displaced during the war. John Caulker is the founder of the nongovernmental organization known as Fambul Tok. The name describes a tradition of nightly bonfires in which family members discuss events and solve problems. The organization facilitates such talks, where community members identify and forgive those who have wronged them. Journalist Sara Terry directed the movie. Terry was a Christian Science Monitor journalist and freelance magazine writer before she became a photojournalist. After publishing a photography collection documenting war-torn Bosnia, Terry became increasingly interested in the effects of conflict, leading her to found The Aftermath Project. Fambul Tok was Terry's first feature-length film. Fambul Tok was produced by Terry, Rory Kennedy and Libby Hoffman. The film ran 81 minutes. It premiered at South by Southwest in 2011 and it was first shown in Europe during that year's Raindance Film Festival. Synopsis The film focuses on three stories at which Caulker and his organization facilitate fambul tok reconciliation talks. The film opens at a bonfire in Foendor, a village in Sierra Leone. A young woman named Esther declares that she was raped at the age of 12 by fifteen men. She identifies one of the men as Joseph, her uncle. Joseph admits to the rape, but says that he was forced by rebels to commit the act under threats of death. Next, a man named Sahr similarly confronts his former friend Nyumah. When rebel forces accosted the men 17 years earlier, Sahr and Nyumah were boys. The rebels attempted to force Sahr to kill his own father. When Sahr refused, the rebels forced Nyumah to severely beat Sahr and to slash the throat of Sahr's father. Nyumah and Sahr reconcile after Nyumah admits to his actions and asks for forgiveness. Much of the film focuses on the search for a man named Tamba Joe and his commander during the war, Captain Mohamed Savage. Tamba Joe was a native son who joined rebel forces during the war and committed violent acts against members of his community. A villager says that Tamba Joe killed and beheaded 17 members of his family. Mohamed Savage, nicknamed \\"Mr. Die\\", initially denied being the person responsible for the murders and violence in Foendor. Bodies of those killed during the war were thrown into the nearby \\"Savage Pit\\". Savage later admits to his role in the violence and plans to return to for a fambul tok. When it is learned that returning for reconciliation could place Savage at risk of prosecution, the meeting is called off. Tamba Joe's location is unknown, but his sister begs for forgiveness of the community. Reception John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \\"shocking and inspiring look at the aftermath of Sierra Leone brutality and a campaign to heal devastated communities.\\" William Brownridge of Toronto Film Scene wrote, \\"By forgiving members of their village, the people of Sierra Leone are doing what the international community couldn‚Äôt: rebuilding their lives. The message of forgiveness is something we can all take away from this film, and perhaps by watching, we‚Äôll find ways to make our own lives better.\\" Christopher Bell of Indiewire rated the film a \\"C+\\", calling the film \\"uneven\\". Bell said that Fambul Tok was \\"without a doubt a very compelling, humanist story, but Terry‚Äôs neglect of the environment they live in is a large misstep.\\" Epilogue An epilogue to the film was subsequently released. At the time of the epilogue, the investigations and prosecutions into war crimes from the conflict are coming to a close but are not quite concluded. Savage returns to Foendor to ask for forgiveness at a fambul tok. Though a village chief is hesitant to reconcile with Savage, he acquiesces to the will of the village's people and forgives him.

Background and early life Vincent was born in Chelsea, London. Her father, Albert Webb, was a Metropolitan Police detective inspector, who had assisted in gathering evidence that resulted in the conviction of John George Haigh, the Acid Bath murderer. Vincent's school was the Grey Coat Hospital school for girls, where she represented London in athletics and was also a skilful singer. She was briefly married to advertising copywriter Michael Vincent, in the 1960s, and also had a relationship with the psychiatrist R. D. Laing. Career Before becoming a journalist, Vincent was employed by a rolling paper company. From 1965, Vincent she wrote frequently for the new Nova magazine, later moving to the Daily Mirror, where she wrote a beauty column, then a column on cookery that was subsequently taken over by Delia Smith. Vincent also wrote for Punch and for The Sunday Times. In 1975 she appeared as a reporter and presenter in the four television broadcasts made by the National Referendum Campaign, advocating a No vote in the referendum on EC membership.

Sample Preparation Using a nonporous ceramic mortar and pestle, a small quantity of the solid sample is ground up until the sample is exceedingly fine and has a glassy appearance. A drop of the mulling agent is added to the ground solid in the mortar. The mixture is further ground up until a uniform paste with the consistency of toothpaste is acquired. The resulting paste is transferred to a salt plate (NaCl) with a small flat spatula. The disks are gently pressed together, leaving the sample ready for analysis. Mulling Agents There are a variety of mineral oils used as mulling agents, their differences being the absorption bands in the IR spectra. The most common mineral oil is Nujol , which is essentially a liquid paraffin based solution and when used for mulling, strong carbon to hydrogen bond absorptions are exhibited in the infrared spectrum. The carbon to hydrogen bond absorptions that may be present in the sample itself are masked by those from the Nujol mulling agent. Fluorolube is also commonly used, and is essentially a fluorocarbon based solution and exhibits strong carbon to fluorine bond absorptions from 1300cm^-1 onwards to 400cm^-1 in the Mid IR spectrum. The useful range for observation of a sample in a Mid IR spectrum when using Fluorolube as the mulling agent is 4000 cm^-1 to 1300cm^-1. Therefore, if possible it is preferable to run a sample as both a Nujol mull and a Fluorolube mull. This allows for all of the spectral features of the sample to be seen in an infrared spectrum, because the regions masked by each specific mulling agent are unaffected in the other spectrum.

It has approximately 1,100 members from 24 countries including publishers, service providers, librarians, researchers, and consultants. SSP is organized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt educational society. Scope The Society for Scholarly Publishing (SSP), founded in 1978, is a nonprofit organization formed to promote and advance communication among all sectors of the scholarly publication community through networking, information dissemination, and facilitation of new developments in the field. SSP members represent all aspects of scholarly publishing ‚Äî including publishers, printers, e-products developers, technical service providers, librarians, and editors. SSP members come from a wide range of large and small commercial and nonprofit organizations. They meet at SSP‚Äôs annual meetings, educational seminars, webinars, and Focus Groups to hear the latest trends from respected colleagues and to discuss common and mutual (and sometimes divergent) goals and viewpoints. SSP is also unique among scholarly communications associations in that it does not take positions on political issues. It is also one of the few scholarly communications societies and associations that allows members to join as individuals. It offers a variety of membership types.  Activities = Educational meetings and events = SSP has held an annual meeting since its formation, bringing together many participants in scholarly publishing including librarians, publishers, scholarly societies, funders and service providers. It also holds additional educational seminars, webinars, focus groups and regional events during the year. = Professional development programs = In addition to educational meeting and events, SSP offers a Fellowship Program to students and early career professionals. Students of publishing, librarianship, and information science, together with early-career professionals in the first four years of employment in the scholarly communications industry, are invited to apply for one of approximately a dozen Fellowships awarded each year. Centered on the SSP Annual Meeting, the Fellowship program supports and nurtures students and early-career professionals who are eager to develop their skills and learning experiences within the scholarly publishing community. The society also offers a Mentorship Program. The Mentorship Program is designed to provide an opportunity for professionals at all career levels to develop new relationships, share experiences, and learn from others outside their organizations by connecting with a mentor. It enables established professionals to give back to the industry and pay forward the support and guidance they received during the development of their career by serving as mentors. The program aims to connect members of SSP for the purposes of professional development, information exchange, networking, personal growth, and career advancement. = Social media = SSP maintains an active social media presence on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. SSP maintains an RSS newsfeed as well. The LinkedIn Group is open to the public upon approval and has more than 8600 followers. =The Scholarly Kitchen= The Scholarly Kitchen (TSK or \\"the Kitchen\\") is a blog published by the SSP. Contributors include senior professionals in scholarly communications. Topics cover journals, textbooks, open access, metrics, and research libraries. The blog was founded in 2008 by Kent Anderson, who served as the editor-in-chief until 2013 when he became president of SSP. Since then, David Crotty has been the executive editor. The Scholarly Kitchen was a 2010 nominee for the Webby \\"Blog-Business\\" award. It has been an important site within academia for discussion of the open access movement. The Society for Scholarly Publishing established The Scholarly Kitchen in February 2008 to: # Keep SSP members and interested parties aware of new developments in publishing # Point to research reports and projects # Interpret the significance of relevant research in a balanced way (or occasionally in a provocative way) # Suggest areas that need more input by identifying gaps in knowledge # Translate findings from related endeavors (publishing outside STM, online business, user trends) # Attract the community of STM information experts interested in these things and give them a place to contribute The Chefs The Kitchen's 20 or so volunteer bloggers are called \\"Chefs\\". They work for diverse organizations in scholarly communications. Their affiliations include society publishers, government agencies, academic libraries, and commercial publishers. Several TSK Chefs are independent consultants. The authors represent their own views, and do not claim to speak for their employers or the SSP. In addition to contributing their blog posts, a number of the Chefs have represented the blog as featured speakers at scholarly communications conferences, including the SSP Annual Meeting, the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers Annual Meeting, the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM) Frankfurt Conference, and the European Association of Science Editors (EASE)/International Society of Managing and Technical Editors (ISMTE) joint meeting. Podcast In 2013, Chef Stewart Wills launched the Scholarly Kitchen Podcast, with assistance from the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The podcast features interviews with individuals of note in scholarly communications. =Learned Publishing= Learned Publishing is a journal published by the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers in collaboration with SSP. Learned Publishing's readers are \\"not-for-profit and commercial publishers worldwide and members of other professions involved with scholarly publishing ‚Äì librarians, academic authors and teachers, and subscription agents ‚Äì as well as printers and other suppliers of services to book and journal publishers.\\" SSP appoints the North American Editor of Learned Publishing. Resources SSP maintains a library of presentations from past events from 2009 to the present. SSP makes an online directory of members and services available to its members. The SSP website contains information for students and professionals considering a career in scholarly publishing as well as information about publishing and library programs. An active Job Board lists career opportunities within the industry. Governance SSP is a volunteer- led organization governed by an unpaid board of directors and committees. All volunteers must be SSP members in good standing. The organization has a full- time executive director, a part-time program director and contracts with a professional management company for accounting, meeting planning, database management, and other services. Lawsuit threat In March of 2013, Edwin Mellen Press threatened to sue SSP for material critical of the press hosted on Scholarly Kitchen. The blog posts in question were temporarily removed and the threats published. As Kent Anderson, editor-in-chief at the time explained, \\"the feeling was that the best way to respond to the threats was to comply with them but also show people what the threats were.\\" Later, the posts were reinstated by the SSP board.

Overview  Many countries in Europe and several states in the US do require identification: * Europe: Overview of national ID cards in Europe * United States: Stop and identify statutes History (Germany) The obligation of identification in Germany was introduced in 1938 by the Nazis for Jews and men of military age and shortly after the start of World War II was extended to apply to all citizens over the age of 15. The identity card was known as Kennkarte. British citizens were obliged to carry identity cards between October 1939 and May 1943. The British identity card did not have a photo of the individual or date of birth, just the name and address. Present day (Germany) The German Act on Identity Cards and Electronic Identification (German: Personalausweisgesetz) requires all citizens over the age of 16 to be in possession of an identity card or passport and to be able to present this document to authorities on request, allowing for fines of up to 5000 ‚Ç¨ in cases of violations. Except for specific circumstances, the act however does not demand carrying such a document at all times; in cases of suspicion of a crime and/or severe doubts as to the identity, police officials may temporarily apprehend persons or accompany them to their homes to produce the document there. The German identity card has a chip which stores an image of the holder's face and may also store fingerprints for holders from the age of 6. Driver's licenses, health insurance cards and other documents issued by government-controlled authorities are not valid means of identification for German citizens. Sweden In Sweden there is no explicit law on obligation of identification. But still the police can demand identification in case of crime suspicion, because they have the duty to identify the identity of suspects. A person who is suspect of a crime giving a fine or an extra fee, such as no local traffic ticket, and are without an identity card, are suspect of identity fraud, a crime that can give prison and warrants an arrest.Brottsbalk 4 kap. 6 b ¬ßPolislag 14 ¬ß Normally those are brought to the police station and are asked for their name and personal id number and are checked against the photo stored in the passport or driver's license database. A fine is not given if the identity is given correctly. Driver's licenses are valid as identification card in Sweden. Car drivers still have mandatory duty to carry their licenses, even if there is no crime suspicion. The situation is similar in the other Nordic countries. Identity documents from Nordic countries are valid in all these countries although some types are less known and can give problems.

After winning his only race as a two- year-old in 1977, he developed into one of the best French-trained colts of his generation when he won the Prix de Guiche, Prix Eug√®ne Adam and Prix Niel. Although he won only once in six races in the following year he showed arguably his best form when easily beating a top-class field in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and running second to Troy in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He later stood as a breeding stallion in France and Japan and had some success as a sire of winners. Background Gay Mecene was a dark bay or brown horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by Jacqueline Getty. His sire, Vaguely Noble, won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1968 before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose best progeny included Dahlia, Exceller and Empery. Gay Mecene's dam Gay Missile was a high-class racemare whose wins included the Ashland Stakes in 1970 before becoming an influential broodmare whose other descendants included Duke of Marmalade, Lemon Drop Kid, A.P. Indy and Summer Squall. As a yearling Gay Mecene was sent to Europe and offered for sale at the Newmarket Houghton sales where he was bought for 60,000 guineas by representatives of the French businessman Jacques Wertheimer. He was then sent to France where he was trained by Alec Head at Chantilly. Racing career=1977: two-year-old season= Gay Mecene made on appearance as a two-year-old in 1977, recording a short-head victory in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. =1978: three-year- old season= On his three-year-old debut, Gay Mecene was matched against Super Concorde, the top-rated French two-year-old of 1977, in the Group Three Prix de Guiche over 1950m at Longchamp Racecourse on 19 April. Starting the 3.9/1 second favourite, he was always going well and won comfortably by one and a half lengths from Peloppones, with Super Concorde running poorly in fifth. The win established Gay Mecene as a contender for the French Classic Races but when moved up to Group One class for the Prix Lupin on 14 May he finished fourth behind Acamas, Pyjama Hunt and Turville after having briefly held the lead in the straight. Gay Mecene bypassed the Prix du Jockey Club and reappeared in the Prix Eug√®ne Adam at Saint-Cloud on 16 July in which he started second favourite behind Pyjama Hunt, who had finished fourth in The Derby and was carrying five pounds less weight. Gay Mecene led from the start and set a steady pace before accelerating in the straight and winning by three quarters of a length and a neck from Rusticaro and Pyjama Hunt with the 2000 Guineas winner Roland Gardens in fourth. After another long break, Gay Mecene returned on 10 September for the Prix Niel over 2200m at Longchamp. On this occasion, Freddy Head employed different tactics, restraining the colt towards the rear of the ten runner field before making his challenge in the straight. He moved up to contest the lead in the last 200m and won by a short head from Noir et Or, with the pair finishing five lengths clear of the Prix du Jockey- Club runner-up Frere Basile in third. Gay Mecene was regarded as a major contender for France's most valuable and prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400m at Longchamp on 1 October and starting the 4/1 third favourite, coupled in the betting with his stable companion Dancing Maid. Ridden by Jean-Claude Desaint (Freddy Head opted to ride Dancing Maid), Gay Mecene was held up at the back of the field and was still only sixteenth of the eighteen runners on the final turn. He made steady progress in the straight but never threatened the leaders and finished eighth behind Alleged. =1979: four-year-old season= Gay Mecene began his third season in the Grand Prix d'Evry over 2400 m at Evry Racecourse on 12 May in which he dead- heated for second place with Vagaries, two lengths behind the winner Noir et Or. Three weeks later, the colt was sent to race outside France for the first time when he contested the Coronation Cup over one and a half miles on soft ground at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He finished a well beaten third of the four runners behind Ile de Bourbon and Frere Basile, but appeared to have a legitimate excuse, as his jockey reported that the colt had never recovered after being struck in the eye by a clod of earth. Gay Mecene returned to France for the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud over 2500 m on 1 July. After three consecutive defeats he started at odds of 12/1 in a strong field which included Noir et Or, Ela-Mana-Mou, Frere Basile, Soleil Noir (Grand Prix de Paris), Trillion, Obraztsovy (Hardwicke Stakes) and El Badr (Prix du Cadran). Head held the colt up at the back of the field before making progress on the turn into the straight. He took the lead 300 m from the finish and accelerated clear of his rivals to record his first Group One success by four lengths from Ela-Mana-Mou: according to Timeform he \\"crushed\\" the opposition. Three weeks later, Gay Mecene made a second visit to Britain when he contested the United Kingdom's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. He was opposed again by Ela-Mana-Mou, but the 2/5 favourite was Troy, who had won the Epsom Derby and the Irish Derby by seven lengths and four lengths respectively. Gay Macene was the only horse to mount a serious challenge, chasing the British colt throughout the last quarter mile and finishing second, one and a half lengths behind the winner despite swerving to the right in the final furlong. On 9 September at Longchamp, Gay Mecene started odds-on favourite for the Prix Foy, a trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He finished third behind Pevero and Trillion, conceding seven pounds to the winner and five to the runner-up. The colt bypassed the Arc, which the Head stable won with Three Troikas, and was instead sent to Germany for the Preis von Europa at Cologne- Weidenpesch Racecourse. He started favourite, but ran poorly, finishing seventh behind Nebos. Assessment In 1978, the independent Timeform organisation gave Gay Mecene a rating of 125, eight pounds below the top-rated three-year-old Ile de Bourbon. In the inaugural International Classification, a collaboration between the official handicappers of France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, Gay Mecene was rated the twelfth-best three-year-old colt in Europe. In the following year, Gay Mecene was rated 128 by Timeform, nine pounds below their Horse of the Year Troy. In the International Classification, he was rated the best older horse in France and the seventh best horse of any age in Europe. Stud record Gay Mecene was retired from racing to stand as a breeding stallion at the Head family's Haras du Quesnay stud near Deauville. He was exported to Japan in 1986 and died there on 24 December 1998.

He was almost invariably credited as S. N. Cooke and his later work was carried out under the auspices of his firm S. N. Cooke and Partners. Works by him and the partnership include significant civic buildings, hospitals, and commercial premises in Birmingham and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  Early career  Hall of Memory, Birmingham Cooke was born in Birmingham, England, in 1883. His early works include the original Birmingham Repertory Theatre (1913), for director Barry Jackson. This was the first purpose-built repertory theatre in the UK. Jackson and Cooke took inspiration from the democratic nature of theatres they had visited in Germany. The design of The Repertory Theatre was particularly influenced by Max Littmann's 1908 ' in Munich. The Birmingham theatre is still in use, now known as the Old Rep. Cooke also designed the city's civic war memorial, the Hall of Memory (1922‚Äì1925), in collaboration with W. N. Twist. The designs included a Doric colonnade, which was moved to St. Thomas' Peace Garden in 1995, after the original site was redeveloped as Centenary Square. During the 1920s and 1930s, he often worked collaboratively with the Birmingham sculptor, William Bloye, for example on the Hall of Memory and at 7‚Äì8 Waterloo Street. Cooke was also involved in plans for the aborted Civic Centre on Broad Street, Birmingham.  S. N.

Lopker and her husband gave a $500,000 endowment to UCSB in 2005 and are also actively involved with the school through other means such as mentorship and acting as guest lecturers.  Career  After graduating from college in 1977, Lopker worked writing software that provided radar defense systems for a Naval defense contractor in Goleta, California. She eventually left that job and pursued a career in business oriented software development. In 1979, Karl Lopker, Lopker‚Äôs UCSB classmate and boyfriend, asked her to help him find software to track the sales, inventory, and shipments of his sandal company, Deckers Outdoors. After finding a lack of suitable software, she decided to start her own company, QAD, that would develop software to deal with all facets of manufacturing. Lopker says that she named the company using the initials of the nearby Queen Anne Road. Since the name QAR was already in use, Lopker replaced the R with a D. Shortly after QAD was founded, Mr. Lopker sold his company Deckers Outdoors and joined QAD as CEO. Mr. Lopker focused on sales and marketing, while Lopker was responsible for research and development. In the late 1980s, the Lopkers sued another distributor for allegedly developing a product that had stolen QAD software. The distributor countersued the Lopkers for defamation of character and malicious prosecution. A federal judge in Chicago dismissed the claims, saying that Lopker had lied in her testimony. The case was eventually settled in 1993 with QAD paying several million dollars in damages.

This \\"therapy\\", mainly aimed at neurodegenerative diseases, would rely on the conversion of mesenchymal stem cells into neurons and it is currently kept secret by its promoters and lacking in scientific validation proving any therapeutic effectiveness; it does not appear, moreover, that Vannoni ever published any article about Stamina therapy in scientific journals thus subjecting it to the usual peer review processes. Faced with pro-Stamina street demonstrations and intense pressure from the media, the Italian government decided in May 2013 to allow the Stamina therapy to be provided in public hospitals despite the protests of the Italian and international scientific community. The experimental treatment was discontinued in October 2014.  Davide Vannoni  Davide Vannoni (7 June 1967 in Turin ‚Äì 10 December 2019 in Turin) was an associate professor at the University of Udine for the communication program of the humanities department. In 2009, he founded Stamina Foundation, a self-declared nonprofit organization of which he was president. He also owned a market research company. In 2015 he was convicted of criminal charges in relation to the Stamina therapy, receiving a 5.5-years prison sentence. Vannoni died on 10 December 2019, at the age of 52, after a long illness. Therapy The proposed method includes the conversion of mesenchymal stem cells (cells usually intended for generation of bones and adipose tissue) into neurons, after a short exposure to retinoic acid diluted in ethanol. The therapy consists in removing cells from the bone marrow of patients, their in vitro manipulation (incubation of stem cells for 2 hours in an 18 micromolar solution of retinoic acid), and finally their infusion into patients themselves. Davide Vannoni, the lead researcher, repeatedly declined to reveal details of his method beyond those available in its patent application. =Supposed effectiveness= Vannoni has never produced scientific evidence concerning the efficacy of the method, but has always advocated its validity. These alleged benefits are highlighted by multiple videos, often self-produced, some of which were broadcast on television, most of the time showing children. From the investigations of the Prosecutor of Turin, the benefits shown in the videos were not measured scientifically and objectively and were the result of exaggeration or adjuvant therapies to which the children were subjected, or normal physical growth that continued despite the disease. History Davide Vannoni reported that he had started the project as a result of personal experience: he has been hospitalized in 2007 in Ukraine for a facial palsy by transplantation of stem cells, getting partial health benefits. He then decided to propose the treatment in Italy too, collaborating, among others, with two Ukrainian biologists, Vyacheslav Klimenko and Olena Shchegelska, first settling in Turin, setting up a laboratory in the basement of his company, then moving to a beauty center in San Marino. A mesenchymal stem cell Between 2007 and 2009 the treatment began to be administered to patients with no control or authorization by the national health system, while it was being advertised in several hospitals by leaflets proclaiming that \\"more than a thousand cases treated, a recovery of damages 70‚Äì100% (90 strokes with 72 recoveries [...]), a range of twenty diseases treated\\", and by a video showing presumed miraculous healing obtained with stem cells. During this period, 68 persons (three were underage) were subjected to the alleged treatment; fourteen of them made payments from 4,000 to 55,000 Euros. In 2009 an investigation was initiated by the magistrate Raffaele Guariniello after an article published in the Corriere della Sera newspaper. The investigation sought to clarify the position of Vannoni concerning the use of stem cells outside of the experimental protocols required by law. At the end of 2009, several newspaper articles were written regarding the activities of Vannoni. Press reports that Vannoni promised his treatment for many neurodegenerative diseases, getting payments ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 Euros, with unclear methodologies and sometimes causing harm and unintended consequences. The investigation of Guariniello also involved the beauty center of San Marino, which was not authorized to administer medical treatments. While Vyacheslav Klimenko and Olena Shchegelska, both left Italy under investigation, Vannoni and his group continued to administer therapies in several Italian cities, often at \\"beauty\\" establishments or transplant centers, moving to Turin, Carmagnola, Trieste, Como and lastly Brescia. Brescia is an important stage in the story of Stamina: thanks to pediatrician Marino Andolina, a collaborator of Vannoni and now vice-president of Stamina Foundation, the Stamina therapy was practiced as expanded access in the Civilian Hospitals of Brescia, the second main Italian hospital, on patients (including several children) affected by serious neurodegenerative diseases. In early 2012, the Carabinieri's Anti-Adulteration Group and the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency began an inspection, which revealed non- compliance with the requirements of safety and hygiene, and a lack of documents required by law. It was found that the cell preparations did not contain any relevant quantities of mesenchymal stem cells, which were not able to differentiate into neurons, and contained a significant amount of dangerous pollutants. According to the analysis of medical records of 36 patients, there was no improvement in the patients, except in three cases (two underage children and an adult), but only on the basis of subjective evaluations. After this, Stamina treatments carried out at the hospital of Brescia were suspended.http://www.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/sites/default/files/ordinanza_1-2012.pdf =Media and political repercussions= The Stamina method came under the media spotlight after a broadcast of the popular Italian television program Le Iene, went on air in February 2013, which showed its use in some children with various neuro-degenerative diseases, including SMA type I. It was argued that the infusion of stem cells would have resulted in significant improvements in few weeks in the status of these diseases, and it was suggested, without any evidence, that it might alter the fatal course. The TV program was accused by many of scientific misinformation. The Stamina case, now both as a media phenomenon and scientifically, was analyzed and criticized by, among others, the Accademia dei Lincei, by Nature and by the European Medicines Agency. In May 2013, thirteen scientists published a critical analysis of the method in the EMBO Journal, highlighting their concerns about the inconsistency of scientific evidence, the methodological shortcomings and the lack of publications. 2012 Medicine Nobel prize laureate Shinya Yamanaka published a public statement in which he expressed concern for permission for experimentation by the Italian authorities of a method about which the safety was not known and which lacked any evidence of efficacy, while Italian oncologist Umberto Veronesi compared the outcry over Stamina to the story of the Di Bella method, an ineffective cancer treatment administered in violation of treatment protocols. In May 2013 the Italian Government unanimously approved the start of a clinical trial of the method developed by Vannoni, also allocating 3 million Euros for the years 2013‚Äì2014, and identifying two healthcare facilities in Abruzzo and Sicily where initiation of the treatment was authorized. In August, Vannoni gave to the National Institute of Health the protocol of the method Stamina in order to start the experiment. On 11 July, the scientific journal Nature published an editorial calling on the Italian government not to proceed with the experimentation, as it was unjustified by any scientific reason, defining Vannoni as a \\"psychologist transformed into businessman doctor\\", while defining Stamina therapy as \\"based on false data\\" and \\"plagiarized\\".http://www.nature.com/news/trial-and- error-1.13346 2013 Medicine Nobel prize laureate Randy Schekman was cited by some pro-stamina families as a supporter of the therapy; the researcher had actually published an article critical of the editorial policies of major scientific journals and firmly denied the support of Stamina, defining Vannoni a quack. =Starting of experimentations= The protocols proposed the method Stamina as suitable for the treatment of X-linked bulbospinal neuropathy, cerebral palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but, surprisingly, the choice of diseases to be treated excluded SMA type I, the most treated pathology up to that point. Treatment of SMA patients was the main subject of the television program Le Iene, which introduced the Stamina method to the general public. For this condition, the inventors and supporters of Stamina stated excellent efficacy, so that even the Stamina Foundation argued that SMA 1 was the only disease for which \\"certified improvements\\" were documented. Paradoxically, Vannoni stated that SMA type I was not included because it was \\"too complex in attesting improvements\\". In September, the Scientific Committee established by the Minister of Health, Beatrice Lorenzin, drew up a negative consultative report, according to which the method likely had low replicability; the report also highlighted a high risk of transmission of diseases such as AIDS and BSE (Mad cow disease). The reasons for such rejection were subjected to the study by the Ministry of Health, that on 10 October definitively rejected the Stamina therapy as \\"dangerous to the health of patients\\". The report of the Ministry also stated that the doses of mesenchymal stem cells in the protocol of Vannoni were minimal, \\"suitable for mice, not for humans\\"; the dose used for stem cell transplantation in humans is about two million per kilogram of body weight, while the protocol Stamina involved the transplantation of two million cells in total, without taking into account body weight. It was also discovered that the protocol delivered to the Civilian Hospitals of Brescia and the one delivered to the Ministry would be different. After Vannoni appealed in court against the commission responsible for human experimentation, accusing them of an alleged lack of impartiality, a new scientific committee was appointed in December 2013. Ten months later, the committee of experts appointed by the Minister of Health Beatrice Lorenzin unanimously rejected the Stamina method, stating that there was no need for starting another scientific experimentation of the therapy. Some tests were done outside of Italy, but in no case was the transformation of cells into neurons achieved. In January 2014 Brescia Civilian Hospitals' medical staff officially declared that Stamina therapy was no longer practiced in the hospital, with the exception of those cases where treatment was ordered by the courts. Patents In December 2009, just after Klimenko and Shchegelska left, Vannoni deposited four patent applications for the Stamina therapy, two in Italy, one in Canada, the last one in the US, stated Enrica Molino, one of his collaborators, as the sole inventor; several elements in the patent applications were taken from Shchegelska's researches published on Ukrainian Neurosurgical Journal in 2006, including the pictures of stem cells, but her name is never mentioned. After submitting the applications to the various patent offices, Vannoni retired them before the official response could come. However, he could no longer withdraw the application at the U.S. Patent Office, the only one where it was possible to find documentation. In 2012, the Patent Office of the United States had partially rejected the patent application, with a procedure that allows the re-presentation: Vannoni has never resubmitted. The rejection was due to the fact that the demand had insufficient details regarding the methodology, to the fact that it is unlikely that cell differentiation occurs during an incubation period so short (from 40 minutes to 2 hours) and that the appearance of the nerve cells in the cultivation might be the result of cytotoxic changes. Substantially there is no official patent on the Stamina method, contrary to the claims of Vannoni, but only a formal application to the patent office of the U.S., however, refused. Judicial cases In February 2014 Vannoni was accused of attempted fraud of the Piedmont regional authorities after he has applied for a loan of EUR 500,000 to fund a stem cell laboratory that never opened. In April 2014 he along with 20 other people was charged with criminal conspiracy, fraud, as well as trade and administration of hazardous medicines. Vannoni was also personally investigated for abusive exercise of the medical profession, defamation and substitution of person.http://www.tmnews.it/web/sezioni/top10/chiusa-inchiesta-su- stamina-20-indagati-per-truffa-anche-vannoni-20140423_133323.shtml In August 2014 a court in Turin demanded that Stamina should stop operating and their equipment should be confiscated. This was supported by Professor Elena Cattaneo, a stem cell expert and an Italian senator. The Senate used its powers to request evidence that to-date had been denied to others. The eventual enquiry resulted in several recommendations, including that courts should always have scientific representatives in similar cases. In October 2014, the Medical Association of Trieste suspended Marino Andolina from the exercise of the profession and in June 2015, he was placed under house arrest, facing trial for alleged exploitation of vulnerable patients and administration of unproven therapies in exchange for money. He was released in late 2016. In 2015, Vannoni was convicted on criminal charges related to administering an unproven treatment and barred from carrying out medical profession in Italy. Other controversies Vannoni has repeatedly stated that the medical care provided by his method is \\"no charge\\", and that the money he received would be \\"donations\\". Several ex-patients and relatives of former patients have argued that there is a definite price list. In July 2013 Vannoni registered the trademark Stamina. In the same period, Stamina Foundation signed an EUR 2 million commercial agreement with Medestea Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company focused on stem cell technologies, which has been accused of working towards getting a deregulation for the use of stem cells. Suspicions were raised by the wealthy lifestyle of Vannoni: he owned a Porsche 911 registered in Switzerland and lived in a luxury mansion near Turin. Vannoni announced his intention to move with the researchers and a cooperative of patients' families to Cape Verde or another country outside Italy, talking about an alleged conspiracy of the pharmaceutical lobbies, bureaucracy and politics against Stamina therapy in Italy. He also claimed that three US universities were willing to test his method.

Bernhard (December 11, 1924 ‚Äì October 29, 2018) was an American cardiovascular surgeon, Emeritus Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, and cardiovascular surgical pioneer. Bernhard's cardiovascular work first came to public light with his 1963 breakthrough hyperbaric chamber work and use of the chamber to try to save Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, son of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Bernhard continued cardiovascular research at Boston Children's Hospital and developed innovative surgical alternatives for cardiovascular disease including the Ventricular Assist Device. Biography William F. Bernhard was born in Brooklyn, New York raised in Great Neck, New York, son of William Bernhard and Helen (Conroy) Bernhard. During World War II, after finishing college at Williams College in three years he served in the United States Navy as an Ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He completed his medical training at Syracuse University Medical School, and after several thoracic and surgical residencies at Bellevue Hospital and New York- Presbyterian Hospital (formerly Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital) in New York Bernhard began his work at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital with heart surgeon Robert E. Gross, MD and in the early 1960s facilitated his deep interest in cardiovascular research by forming Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital Cardiovascular Research Laboratory. Bernhard is a Professor of Surgery, Emeritus at Harvard Medical School, and conducted many of his breakthrough surgeries for implantation of the Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) in other Harvard affiliated hospitals. During his career Bernhard also served as an attending surgeon thoracic cardiovascular surgery at the VA Hospital, West Roxbury and a consultant in cardiothoracic surgery at Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, 1986. Professional work In the mid to late 1970s numerous cardiovascular programs were competing to find a way to extend life for those with inoperable end-stage cardiovascular disease. Bernhard began his breakthrough work at Boston Children's Hospital as one of the principal clinical investigators of the development of temporary heart assist devices. His work changed the development of research into heart assist devices when the Nation Heart Lung and Blood Institute was preparing to cancel all related research. At an American Heart Association meeting in November 1978 he announced that two people had survived for several days with the left ventricular heart assist device Ventricular Assist Device before being weaned off the device. In 1987, after ten years of continued work, Bernhard went on to work to develop a left ventricular heart pump, manufactured by Thermedics, Inc. of Woburn, MA an affiliated company of Thermo Electron Corporation with funding by the National, Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. This research opened pathways to survival for severely ill cardiovascular patients. The early part of Bernhard's career was spent in surgical service to children with severe heart disorders. Bernhard performed most of his surgery at Children‚Äôs Hospital in Boston where he treated children and adolescents from 1960 until his retirement. Bernhard‚Äôs work included the development of ground breaking surgical techniques for the heart and the first successfully implanted LVAD device (see Ventricular Assist Device) manufactured while working with a group of scientists from Thermedics, Inc. of Woburn, MA. Bernhard's work is documented in over 50 articles in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery as well as investigative television programs including CBS‚Äô 60 Minutes and PBS‚Äô Nova NOVA Investigates the risks, costs and controversies surrounding the development of the artificial heart - first broadcast on PBS in Season 11, Episode 2, on October 18, 1983 Over the course of his career, his open heart surgery on infants utilizing the hyperbaric chamber received worldwide attention in Time magazine August 16, 1963 Pediatrics: An Infant‚Äôs Cause of Death: Hyaline Membrane Disease. The development of the first successful LVAD prototype device developed with Thermedics was named ‚ÄúHeartmate‚Äù and the Heartmate II, manufactured by a successor company Thoratec, was implanted into Vice President Dick Cheney in July 2010 During the 1980s he continued research and clinical trials on an air driven left ventricular assist device and the pneumatic implantable device which became the Heartmate device for end-stage heart failure. This was one of many individual component studies that went into the development of a heart pump. Bernhard and his staff worked to complete long term clinical trial studies and eventually a subsidiary company of Thermedic‚Äôs, Thermo Cardiosystems merged with Thoratec Laboratories Corporation (Nasdaq: THOR), and obtained FDA approval in 2002 of the ‚ÄúHeartmate‚Äù LVAD device Thoratec Heartmate II LVAD device is used in implantation today, and was implanted in Dick Cheney in July 2010 before his heart transplant in March 2012.

Plot Zero fighter plane In 2004, twenty-six-year-old Kentaro Saeki is repeatedly failing the national bar examination and is uncertain about his future. One day, after the funeral of his grandmother, Matsuno, he is startled to learn from his mother and older sister Keiko that his maternal grandfather Kenichiro was not his blood-relation. Keiko and Kentaro start hearing stories about their real grandfather, Kyuzo Miyabe and visit many of his former comrades all of whom begin by criticizing his \\"timidity\\" in battle. During conversation with an old comrade of his grandfather, Izaki, who is in hospital dying of cancer, Kentaro finally learns the reason why Miyabe became a Kamikaze pilot. Izaki talks about his relationship with their grandfather to Keiko and Kentaro, claiming that only the \\"timid\\" Miyabe gave him the hope to save his own life after he was shot down over the ocean. The film begins with an unspecified attack near the end of the Pacific War, a Zero fighter plane threatens the United States Pacific Fleet by cutting through its defensive anti-aircraft fire. Kyuzo Miyabe, the pilot of the Zero fighter is regarded by his comrades as a coward, though an exceptionally skilled fighter pilot, for consistently returning alive from missions, openly explaining \\"I don't want to die,\\" the result of a promise made to his wife Matsuno and daughter Kiyoko: to return from the war alive. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy advances steadily, only to be steadily beaten hollow in the battles from Battle of Midway and Bombing on Rabaul onwards. Despite the rising desperation and hopelessness of their situation, all of Miyabe's men say they wish to die gloriously in battle. However, he persuades them, by his simple and honest example, that to survive is worthwhile. Miyabe accepts severe beatings by outraged senior officers several times for speaking these opinions, but refuses to retract them. Both Keiko and Kentaro still are puzzled as to why their grandfather - eventually - volunteers for Kamikaze Attack. Kentaro, now obsessed with finding the answer, spends much time researching the war. At a blind dinner date with several friends, he becomes incensed when one compares the Kamikaze pilots to suicide bombers and storms off. He continues talking with Miyabe's most reticent and intimidating comrade in arms, now the head of a Yakuza-linked, right-wing group, and finds the man willing to explain his own story, which begins to explain this puzzle. He and his sister then learn the details and unfolding of the promise between Miyabe and their living grandfather Kenichiro before the final mission. Miyabe is said by his wife to have kept his promise, by ensuring that many worthy lives were not pointlessly lost and by providing his wife and child with Kenichiro, who becomes a loving husband and father. One summer day in 1945, Kyuzo Miyabe boards a Zero fighter but then asks Kenichiro if he can \\"make a selfish request\\" and change planes with him. Kenichiro's plane develops engine trouble and he has to return, leaving Miyabe alone to attack an - (in reality an aircraft carrier, CV-17, the was damaged by kamikaze attack during the battle for Okinawa.

However, director Yamazaki and scriptwriter Tamio Hayashi had to edit the original story and remove many of the novel's characters and scenes. Yamazaki said that the production team had \\"really struggled at the script stage, trying to extract the essence of the novel.\\" Hyakuta himself did not express any objections to the final film script. With regards to casting, Yamazaki said that they had cast actors on \\"the basis of whether they were right for the role, not their popularity\\". He also said that the crew wanted \\"young actors who had something of the atmosphere of that time about them\\". Specifically, Yamazaki referred to Okada, saying that \\"He was extremely close to our image of Miyabe\\". He further elaborated by saying that \\"In the film the character knows martial arts, so Okada studied hard. He got so much into it that he became a shihan [qualified teacher].\\". He praised Okada as a guy \\"who's really thorough when he focuses on one thing.\\" The film uses Computer-generated imagery to replicate the scenes of bombing runs and dogfights, given the limitation of having a small number of Zero fighters being in a flyable condition having survived till the present day.

It matched the last record for a Japanese live action film with seven successive weeks at number one with Hero (2007). With more than seven weeks in cinemas, it had grossed ¬•6.98 billion. The film earned at the Japanese box office, becoming the 2nd highest- grossing Japanese film of 2013 in the country and the 3rd highest-grossing film of the year in the country. The Eternal Zero won the Golden Mulberry, the top audience award, at the 16th Udine Far East Film Festival in Italy. The film will be released in Taiwan on 12 September 2014. Controversy The Eternal Zero has come under criticism for its nationalistic and sympathetic depiction of the Kamikaze pilots. Director Hayao Miyazaki in an interview accused the film of \\"trying to make a Zero fighter story based on a fictional war account that is a pack of lies\\". He added that this film was \\"just continuing a phony myth\\" and that he had \\"hated that sort of thing ever since [I] was a kid.\\" Kazuyuki Izutsu, the director of the 2005 film Break Through! said that the film had \\"no basis in fact\\". The film has also courted controversy amongst Japan's neighbors, especially China, with one Chinese commentator reportedly accusing the film of being \\"propaganda for terrorism\\". However, the film's director, Takashi Yamazaki, rejected these interpretations of the film, saying, \\"The film depicts the war as a complete tragedy, so how can you say it glorifies war?... I really don't get it.\\" He eventually dismissed such criticism, saying that \\"In the end, people see what they want to see. If you think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're going to see it as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what.\\" Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that \\"In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination\\", \\"I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light\\", and the theme of the book was \\"not to allow our memories of war to fade away\\". The author also added in a tweet, \\"I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite side, left- wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...]. It is drawing fire literally from all directions.\\" Yet the book and the film have been warmly received by its Japanese audiences: the film was one of the highest-grossing films of the year in Japan. Notably, Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, declared his support for this film and the book, saying that he had been \\"moved\\" by it. Yoko Ono also dedicated a special message to the brochure of the film, expressing her concurrence to the message of the film.Official brochure of the film Eien no Zero (2013). p.40, Tokyo: Toho Pictures Inc. Visual Department. Critics have accused the film of misrepresenting Kamikaze pilots. They argued that instead of the pilots being willing to sacrifice themselves for Japan as depicted in the film, these pilots were actually forced to take part in these suicide missions. Other media In June 2014, TV Tokyo announced that the station would adapt the film for a TV drama featuring Osamu Mukai. Some parts in the original book which don't appear in the film are described in the drama. It was broadcast on 11, 14 and 15 February 2015. The film will be issued on DVD and BD in Japan on 23 July 2014.

It became a listed building on 16 March 1977. History Louis Coilliot, a French ceramic entrepreneur, was fond of enamelled lava and wanted to popularise the technique. To do so, Coilliot commissioned Hector Guimard, an architect he had met at the 1897 fair La C√©ramique et tous les arts du feu, (\\"Ceramic Arts & Glass Making\\"), to apply the technique to his house's fa√ßade. Coilliot‚Äôs factory and warehouse were located to the rear of his house, and therefore the fa√ßade held a double purpose, both decorating the front of his home and advertising his business. Description The Coilliot House is constructed of bricks and cut stone, with decorative elements in wrought iron, ceramic and enamelled lava. There is a shop on the ground floor, and apartments make up the rest of the three upper floors. The house has two fa√ßades: a street fa√ßade aligned with the neighbouring buildings‚Äô, and a recessed fa√ßade which stands at an angle. The two fa√ßades are linked by balconies on the two upper floors. Green tiles of enameled lava flank the street fa√ßade, whose pediment is surmounted by a wooden roof. Round the back of the house is a 744 m2-plot on which two buildings that used to be owned by the Coilliot family still stand: the Coilliot company‚Äôs warehouse, designed by Fran√ßois Hennebique, and a block of flats the family would let for additional income. The whole lot was built on a skewed plot of land; as such, the block of flats has its own address at 13/17 rue Fabricy. While only the Coilliot House itself is a registered building (including its interior), the block of flats and warehouse also feature Art Nouveau details deemed worthy of preservation. For instance, elements of the apartment block's fa√ßade at 13/17 rue Fabricy and its ceramic fireplaces were added by the DRAC to the national heritage register in October 2011. The house is private property and visitors are therefore not allowed in. The house was open to the public only once on 17 September 2000. However, the house's Art Nouveau interior decoration and furniture can be seen in a short clip shot in 1983 and now accessible on the INA website. Recent developments In September 2008, the whole lot was to be broken up and sold off piecemeal to different buyers.

The photo series documents the desolate empty lots, sidewalks, and front yards where random, unsolved murders in New Orleans had taken place. Photographed at night, each photograph is titled simply with the murder victim's name, date of birth, and date murdered.

The law went into effect on September 1, 2009. Vermont became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage, the first to do so by legislation rather than a court ruling. Prior status Prior to the Act, same-sex couples in Vermont were allowed since 2000 to engage in civil unions, which granted most rights of married couples. Marriage legislation On February 9, 2007, several house members introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, but no action was taken. On July 25, 2007, legislative leaders announced the creation of an 11-member committee to study whether the state should do so. The Vermont Commission on Family Recognition and Protection held 8 public hearings and conducted a seminar at Vermont Law School. Opponents of same-sex marriage did not participate, saying the panel was not impartial. At one hearing, Peter Teachout, a law professor, suggested that the notion of two \\"tracks\\", civil union and marriage, could easily be discredited by creating the two without specifying whether same-sex couples or different-sex couples would get which. \\"Just flip a coin at the end and decide who gets marriage and who gets civil unions. Let's see how many people vote for the two-track system then.\\" Another testified that 8 states recognized Vermont's civil unions as the equivalent of marriage. The commission reported on April 21, 2008, and rather than make a recommendation it said: \\"It is the role of Vermont's policy-makers and elected officials to read and reflect on this report and in their best judgment determine what steps to take in their role as public servants of the people of Vermont.\\" It detailed the differences between civil unions and marriage and noted that a same-sex couple in a civil union lacked \\"access to less tangible incidents of marriage, including its terminology (e.g. marriage, wedding, married, celebration, divorce), and its social, cultural and historical significance\\". It noted that marriage was a status understood in other jurisdictions that lacked any equivalent for civil unions. Opponents said that a popular referendum remained the proper way to resolve the issue. When Representative Mark Larson, on behalf of 59 co-sponsors, introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage on February 6, 2009, Governor James Douglas said economic and budgetary issues should be the legislature's first concern. The State Senate approved its version of the legislation on March 23 by a vote of 26 to 4. Kris Mineau, president for the Massachusetts Family Institute, said that advocates of same-sex marriage \\"have wisely targeted the New England states, because of their progressive stance on social issues. But we have not conceded defeat.\\" Governor Jim Douglas announced his intention to veto the bill on March 25 for the first time. He said it was unusual to promise a veto before legislation passed but \\"During these extraordinary times, the speculation about my decision has added to the anxiety of the moment and further diverts attention from our most pressing issues\\". On April 3, the House passed an amended version of the bill 95‚Äì52, several votes shy of a veto-proof two-thirds majority. On April 6, 2009, the Vermont Senate approved the amendments made by the House. The governor vetoed the legislation the same day. He said he was \\"sending it to the Legislature urging them to do what their consciences lead them to do, most importantly to do it quickly and get on with the business of the state.\\" He said he was not lobbying legislators: \\"I think this is such an emotional, divisive, personal issue, it's something that individuals have to decide how to vote on based on their personal convictions and faith and I think each legislator ought to decide personally what to do.\\" On April 7, 2009, the Senate overrode the veto by a 23‚Äì5 vote and the House overrode it 100‚Äì49, the first time since 1990 that a Vermont governor's veto was overridden. Six of those voting in favor of the legislation were Republicans. House Speaker Shap Smith said that votes changed in the House not because of specific pressures but because \\"it was to some degree just a vote to recognize the work that the Legislature had done\\". Representative Jeff Young, who switched his vote, said \\"I had to vote with my caucus\\" in order to win support for his other priorities.

From 2014 to 2017, the high school has undergone renovations to expand the school and remove an outbreak of asbestos beneath the flooring. Part of this renovation included an all new gymnasium, bullet proof windows, and a new modern look. The auditorium was removed and replaced with a small theater room. This new seal replaced the old asbestos-infected seal, while still giving credit to the original class. Athletics Putnam High School's athletic programs, nicknamed the Clippers, have captured four Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference State Championships. The Putnam High football team defeated Haddam-Killingworth 20-14 for the 1994 Class S Championship. The Clippers lost championship games to Ansonia in 1984 and to Trinity Catholic in 1993.The Connecticut Association of Schools - Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference The Putnam boys basketball team won the Class S championship in 1986 against Portland 60-58. The team lost the championship game in 1929, 1930, 1956, 1995 and 2006. The baseball team won the 1985 Class S title, topping Thomaston 7-3. The Clipper softball team defeated Old Saybrook 7-1 for the 1989 Class S Championship, and was runner-up in 1991 and 1992. Putnam High School joined the Eastern Connecticut Conference (ECC) in the 2000-2001 school year. They switched to the Constitution State Conference (CSC) in the 2010-2011 school year. Administration The principal of Putnam High School is Jaqueline Vetrovec as of 2015. Cheerleading The cheerleading squad won the ECC Cheer Championships in 2001, 2002, 2008, and 2009. In 2002, the Class \\"S\\" was dissolved for the competition and Putnam competed in Class \\"M.\\" The Class \\"S\\" division was resumed thereafter. In the 2001 State Championships the cheerleading squad finished 4th in Class \\"S,\\" coming in 1 point behind Ellington, missing the 3rd-place finish. They finished Top 5 in 1999 and 2001.

It has its name after a radiant sun disk on the headboard. The throne has the shape of a platform, similar to the Marble Throne in Golestan Palace. The Naderi Throne was constructed later and has the appearance of a chair.  History  It was constructed for Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, Shah of Persia, in the early nineteenth century and was used as the coronation throne from then onwards. He took Tavous Khanum Taj ol-Doleh as one of his consorts. In English, her name translates to Lady Peacock. The marriage ceremony took place on the throne, and Tavous Khanum became his favourite wife. Due to her name, the throne later received the misnomer \\"Peacock Throne\\" (Persian: ÿ™ÿÆÿ™ ÿ∑ÿßŸàŸàÿ≥, Takht-e TƒÅv≈´s).http://www.internetstones.com/takht-e-taus-the-peacock-throne-as- described-by-tavernier.html It was also theorised that parts of the plundered Mughal Peacock Throne were re-used, such as the legs or other parts, however no conclusive proof exists. Nevertheless, in a metonymic sense, the term \\"Peacock Throne\\" also referred rhetorically initially in the West to the institution of the Persian monarchy. Not a single element on the Sun Throne features a peacock. The Lion and Sun was the ancient symbol of kingship in Persia. When the Shah would be seated on the throne, he symbolised the lion, with the sun symbol behind his back. The Shah himself however could also be seen as the sun. The last Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, carried the title Aryamehr (Light of the Aryans), which was another connotation for the sun. The throne was probably modeled after the older Marble Throne, with which it shares many features. The throne has the shape of a raised platform to which two stairs led. The steps feature allegories of fierce creatures. Around the platform is a golden railing inscribed with calligraphy with Koranic verses. In the middle of the platform the sovereign would take his seat elevated above the ground. This has strong connotations to the ancient Persian symbol Faravahar, the winged sun. The throne originally also featured two sculptured birds on either side of the sun, facing it. This added to the symbolism of the elevated, floating throne, occupying a place away from earth and towards heaven. At the end of the nineteenth century, the sovereign started taking his place on the steps of the throne instead of in the middle of it. Until 1980 the Sun Throne was located in the Mirror Hall of Golestan Palace. In 1980 it was decided to move it to the vaults of the Iranian Crown Jewels at Iran's Central Bank where it is now on display.

Pyrobitumen is mostly insoluble in carbon disulfide and other organic solvents as a result of molecular cross-linking, which renders previously soluble organic matter (i.e., bitumen) insoluble.B. P. Tissot and D. H. Welte (1984) Petroleum Formation and Occurrence, 2nd ed., Springer-Verlag, pp. 460-463.J. M. Hunt, Petroleum Geochemistry and Geology, 2nd ed., Freeman, 1996, p. 437. Not all solid bitumens are pyrobitumens, in that some solid bitumens (e.g., gilsonite) are soluble in common organic solvents, including , dichloromethane, and benzene-methanol mixtures. Other related hydrocarbons While the primary distinction between bitumen and pyrobitumen is solubility, the thermal processes driving the molecular cross-linking also decrease the atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon from greater than one to less than one and ultimately to approximately one half. It should also be understood that both solubility and atomic H/C ratios form a continuum, and most solid bitumens have both soluble and insoluble components. The distinction between pyrobitumen and residual kerogen in a mature source rock is based on microscopic evidence of fluid flow within the rock fabric and is usually not determined. The terms bitumen and pyrobitumen have related definitions in the Earth's crust and in the laboratory. In geology, bitumen is the product of deposition and maturation of organic matter. The extractable organic material (EOM) in petroleum source rocks and reservoir rocks is defined as bitumen. Upon exposure to high regional temperatures over geological time, bitumen is converted to pyrobitumen as a result of the thermally activated reactions that drive off lighter oil and gas products and leave an insoluble, carbon-rich residue. Pyrobitumen represents a significant fraction of the ultimate fate of petroleum liquids formed from kerogen during catagenesis. In the laboratory, experiments on organic-rich rocks (oil shales and petroleum source rocks), decomposition of the initially insoluble organic matter (defined as kerogen) produces gaseous and liquid products. The soluble fluid that remains in the heated rock is defined as bitumen. Upon further thermal exposure, the bitumen continues to evolve and disproportionates into pyrobitumen and more oil and gas. The terms bitumen and asphalt are often used interchangeably to describe highly viscous to solid forms of petroleum that have been used in construction since the fifth millennium B.C.Asphalt, downloaded January 2, 2014. Bitumen is distinct from tar, which properly describes a product formed by pyrolysis (destructive distillation) of coal or wood. Pitch recovered from petroleum by distillation is also sometimes called bitumen or asphalt.Pitch (resin), downloaded January 2, 2014. Etymology The expression \\"bitumen\\" originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words jatu, meaning \\"pitch,\\" and jatu-krit, meaning \\"pitch creating\\", \\"pitch producing\\" (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu-men (pertaining to pitch), and by others, pixtumens (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to bitumen. Definition HuntJ. M. Hunt, Petroleum Geochemistry and Geology, 1st ed., Freeman, 1979, p. 28, 546. defines bitumen as a native substance of variable color, viscosity, and volatility composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen. He further defines petroleum as a form of bitumen that is gaseous or liquid in the reservoir and can be produced through a pipe. Other bitumens range from very viscous (e.g., Athabasca and Venezuelan heavy oils, La Brea tar pits) to solid (e.g. gilsonite, ozocerite, grahamite, impsonite). Pyrobitumen is formed by thermal decomposition and molecular cross-linking of bitumen. Pyrobitumen is distinguished from other solid bitumens extruded from early-mature kerogen- rich source rocks (e.g., gilsonite) and semi-solid bitumens in high viscosity oil sands formed by water washing and biodegradation of conventional oil (e.g., Athabasca bituminous sands), all of which are soluble in carbon disulfide. Figure 2. Classification System for Solid Bitumens Adapted from Curiale using modern organic geochemical techniques. Classification Archaic classification systems for classifying bitumens were constructed without the extensive knowledge of organic geochemistry developed over the past 50 years. Pyrobitumen was originally defined as a solid bitumen that is insoluble and infusible. The original classification system for solid bitumen of Abraham,H. Abraham (1945) Asphalts and Allied Substances, Van Nostrand- Rheinhold, page 62. as adapted from Curiale,J. A. Curiale, Origin of solid bitumens, with emphasis on biological marker results, Org. Geochem. Vol. 10, pp. 559-580, 1986. is shown in Figure 1. Curiale says that while the historical classification scheme is useful for sorting museum collections, it is not useful for establishing genetic relationships, and he proposed the alternative classification shown in Figure 2. Although there is not a direct relationship between the classification systems in Figures 1 and 2, one kind of pyrobitumen is a subset of the post-oil solid bitumen formed by thermal degradation of kerogen and oil. Of the 27 samples investigated by Curiale, the three impsoniteImpsonite, downloaded January 2, 2014. samples had low solubility (<3%) and a low H/C ratio (<0.9) characteristic of highly mature organic matter. These samples also had the lowest asphaltene, highest aromatic, and highest volatile content in the soluble fraction. Carbon deposits associated with uranium nodules also had low solubilities and H/C ratios less than 1.0 and correspond to pyrobitumens with inorganic origins. For comparison, coal tar pitch has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.8.E. Fitzer, K.H. Dochling, H. P Boehm, and H. Marsh, ‚ÄúRecommended terminology for the description of carbon as a solid,‚Äù Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 67, pp. 473-506, 1995. In the petroleum geochemistry community, pyrobitumen is the remains of thermally altered oil that was previously generated during kerogen maturation‚Äîmuch of that oil migrated to and accumulated in an oil reservoir. Petrographic studies of residues of hydrous pyrolysis, which is considered to be a good laboratory simulation of natural petroleum formation, show the formation of a continuous bituminous network during the early stages of kerogen transformation, some of which is converted to pyrobitumen at high thermal exposure.M. D. Lewan, ‚ÄúPetrographic study of primary petroleum migration in the Woodford Shale and related rock units,‚Äù in (ed. B. Doligez) Migration of Hydrocarbons in Sedimentary Basins, Editions Technip, Paris, p.113-130. This definition is consistent with that given for pyrobitumen in the Society of Petroleum Engineers Glossary: ‚Äúa hard, native asphalt within the [rock] pores. Does not ordinarily move or enter into the reaction.‚Äùhttp://www.spe.org/glossary/wiki/doku.php/terms:pyrobitumen, downloaded January 2, 2014. HuntJ. M. Hunt, Petroleum Geochemistry and Geology, 2nd ed., Freeman, 1996, p. 597. uses this definition of thermally mature residue to calculate material balances for the fate of oil at very high maturities, both that retained in the source rock and that from reservoirs. Pyrobitumen in thermally mature oil reservoirs has been characterized by Hwang.R. J. Hwang, S. C. Teerman, R. M. Carlson, ‚ÄúGeochemical comparison of reservoir solid bitumens with diverse origins,‚Äù Org. Geochem. Vol. 29, pp. 505-517, 1998. More recently, the pyrobitumen retained in the source rock is considered to play an important role in the storage and production of shale gas.R. G. Loucks, R. M. Reed, S. C. Ruppel, and D. M. Jarvie, ‚ÄúMorphology, genesis, and distribution of nanometer-scale pores in siliceous mudstones of the Mississippian Barnett Shale,‚Äù J. Sed. Res., Vol. 79, pp. 848-861 (2009). In oil shale retorting, pyrobitumen residue has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.5 and is often called coke,A. K. Burnham and J. A. Happe, ‚ÄúOn the mechanism of kerogen pyrolysis,‚Äù Fuel, Vol. 63, 1353-1356, 1984. which has its analog in the production of petroleum and coal cokes by destructive distillation. Some archaic definitions of pyrobitumen include peat and lignite, although these materials experienced little geological heating compared to that required to form fluid bitumen, let alone pyrobitumen. For humic-derived solids in the earth, an analogous position on the coal maturation pathway would place it at a minimum in the medium-volatile bituminous range (i.e., H/C<0.8, O/C<0.05, and vitrinite reflectance >1.0%).,J.

Mukhopahyay, ‚ÄúMaturation of organic matter as revealed by microscopic methods: Applications and limitations of vitrinite reflectance, and continuous spectral and pulsed laser fluorescence spectroscopy, ‚Äúin Diagenesis, III. Developments in Sedimentology, Vol 47, pp. 435-510, 1992. states that solid bitumen starts to form when vitrinite reflectance reaches 0.45%, i.e., the early stages of conversion of kerogen to oil and gas. Bitumen also becomes more reflective with maturity, and he gives an equivalent bitumen reflectance of 0.6% for a vitrinite reflectance of 1.0%, which corresponds to the boundary between asphalt/albertite and epi-impsonite. Although the archaic definition of pyrobitumen includes low-maturity solid bitumens such as albertite, a definition more closely linked to the formation and destruction of oil from kerogen would define pyrobitumen as having an H/C ratio less than 1.0. In fact, the Biomarker GuideK. E. Peters, C. C. Walters, J. M. Moldowan, The Biomarker Guide, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 1155. defines pyrobitumen as having an H/C ratio less than 0.5, which corresponds to vitrinite reflectance of about 2.0% and low-volatile bituminous to semi-anthracite coal rank. Hwang et al. found that the solubility of solid reservoir bitumens decreased below 50% for a vitrinite reflectance of 0.7% and below 20% for vitrinite reflectance greater than 1.0%, with a vitrinite reflectance of 1.1% corresponding to an atomic H/C ratio of 0.8. Warner et al.J. L. Warner, D. K. Baskin, R. J. Hwang, R. M. K. Carlson, M. E. Clark, Geochemical Evidence for Two Stages of Hydrocarbon Emplacement and the Origin of Solid Bitumen in the Giant Tengiz Field, Kazakhstan, in P. O. Yilmaz and G. H. Isaksen, eds., Oil and gas of the Greater Caspian area: AAPG Studies in Geology 55, 2007, pp. 165-169. also found pyrobitumen in the Tengiz field with H/C of 0.8. They also quote it as having high reflectivity, including the occurrence of mosaic reflectivity texture. Pyrolysis yielded some oil similar to that from which it was derived. BordenaveM. L. Bordenave, Applied Petroleum Geochemistry, Editions Technip, Paris, 1993, pp. 106, 159. describes pyrobitumen as having a reflectivity of between 1.5 and 2.5% and a pyrolysis yield of less than 80 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon. From these descriptions and other pyrolysis studies, it becomes clear that the H/C ratio of 0.5 given by Peters corresponds to the end of such pyrolysis yield, even though the bitumen becomes insoluble, and therefore pyrobitumen, prior to that maturity.

In 2015, Karkazis testified before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in the case of Dutee Chand v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) & The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and in July 2015 the CAS issued a decision to suspend its sex verification policy on excluding women athletes with hyperandrogenism (high levels of testosterone) due to insufficient evidence of a link between high androgen levels and improved athletic performance. The court allowed two further years for convincing evidence to be submitted by the IAAF, after which the regulation will be automatically revoked if evidence has not been provided. In 2016, Karkazis was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to work on a book on testosterone, T: The Unauthorized Biography, with co-author Rebecca Jordan-Young.

The team was the third intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy, and the first time the school participated in consecutive seasons. The squad was captained by member Frank Hill. The team played just a single game, a 2 to 0 (2‚Äì0) shutout loss to Johns Hopkins, which was the school's first ever loss. The squad was the first to have the approval of the academy's staff, and is regarded as the first official game played by the Midshipmen. The season continued a seven-season, eight game rivalry between the Naval Academy and Johns Hopkins. Prelude The first intercollegiate football game was played on November 6, 1869, between the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, then known as the Rutgers Queensmen, and the New Jersey Tigers, now the Princeton Tigers. The game was a mixture of rugby and soccer, with teams scoring by kicking the ball into the opponent's net. The game slowly developed, with many new and safer rules being added during the early 1870s. The number of schools participating in the sport also grew. However, even with the expansion, Princeton dominated the game, being declared the champion eight times in ten years. Yale was the only team which came close to Princeton, being awarded four championship designations during the same period.NCAA 2009, p. 78 The Naval Academy's first ever football team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student- operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by its members and their fellow students. The 1879 team participated in just one game, which resulted in a scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, at most likely an unused drill field on the Naval Academy campus.Kiland et al., p 191 Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, likely due to the lack of support. When football returned to the academy in 1882, the squad was led by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and won 8‚Äì0 in a match with Johns Hopkins, starting the seven- year rivalry between the schools. ScheduleSeason summary=Johns Hopkins 2, Navy 0= The Naval Academy team played its only game of the 1883 season against a squad from Johns Hopkins University. It was captained by Frank Hill, and was the first squad to receive approval from Naval Academy faculty.Patterson (2000), p. 22 Previously, the squad was operated entirely by students. The game was played at the Naval Academy on November 29, 1883, Thanksgiving Day, most likely on an unused drill field or parade field. The game \\"began in heat and discussion\\", with the \\"skillful and light weight\\" Johns Hopkins controlling the \\"endurance and muscle\\" of the Naval Academy's team. However, tensions in the game quickly escalated. During the middle of the game, \\"matters grew so hot\\" that Johns Hopkins players were preparing to stop playing. Johns Hopkins scored two single-point safeties and shutout Navy, winning 2‚Äì0. The game \\"ended in quarrel and wrangle\\". Postseason and aftermath The first postseason college football game would not be played until 1902, with the Pasadena Tournament of Roses' establishment of the east‚Äìwest tournament game, later known as the Rose Bowl. The Midshipmen would not participate in their first Rose Bowl until the 1923 season, when they went 5‚Äì1‚Äì2 and tied with the Washington Huskies 14‚Äì14 in the match. As a result of the lack of a competition, there were no postseason games played after the 1882 season. According to statistics compiled by the National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis, the Helms Athletic Foundation, and the Billingsley college football research center, Yale was declared the 1883 season champion, giving them their ninth championship overall. The Midshipmen's loss was the first in school history, and ended the team's shutout streak at two seasons. The Naval Academy would not get another shutout until the 1886 season, when they defeated Johns Hopkins 6‚Äì0. The 1883 season continued a seven-season, eight-game long rivalry with Johns Hopkins, which Navy would win, five games to four. The 1883 game was the first win for Johns Hopkins, which had officially started playing football in 1881.Patterson (2000), p. 3 1883 is considered to be the first season played by the Naval Academy, according to the school athletic department. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14‚Äì12‚Äì2. The school would outscore their opponents 292‚Äì231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54‚Äì19‚Äì3.

They are proposed nullification laws that, if enacted as law, would prohibit the state governments from co- operating with the National Security Agency, whose mass surveillance efforts are seen as unconstitutional by the proposals' proponents. Specific examples include the Kansas Fourth Amendment Preservation and Protection Act and the Arizona Fourth Amendment Protection Act. The original proposals were made in 2013 and 2014 by legislators in the American states of Utah, Washington, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and California. Some of the bills would require a warrant before information could be released, whereas others would forbid state universities from doing NSA research or hosting NSA recruiters, or prevent the provision of services such as water to NSA facilities. The bills are based on a model act provided by the Tenther movement and Offnow.  History  The events of the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to some sweeping changes in national security policies. Through the enactment of Title II: Enhanced Surveillance Procedures of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, many government agencies were granted increased power of surveillance. Controversy arose from the increased surveillance that was granted. Proponents of the act argued that the increased surveillance measures were necessary for the protection and safety of the country, while detractors argued that the increased power of surveillance infringed upon Fourth Amendment protections. Among the controversial programs that were put into place was the President's Surveillance Program, which embodied the Terrorist Surveillance program. Through this surveillance program, President George W. Bush authorized the NSA to wiretap international calls where one party was suspected of having affiliations with Al Qaeda. It also reportedly allowed for data mining of emails, internet activity, text messaging and telephone call records, stored in a NSA call database. The Terrorist Surveillance program became better known as NSA warrantless surveillance after several NSA whistle-blowers, William E. Binney, Ed Loomis, Thomas A. Drake and J. Kirk Wiebe, came forward with information about database collection program Trailblazer, which replaced the Thin Thread Project, eliminating privacy protection for US Citizens in the NSA's datamining and collection program that Thin Thread had in place to focus those collections on foreign intelligence. The information presented by Binney, Loomis, Drake and Wiebe brought the controversial practices of the NSA to the public eye, further inciting the controversy around the increased power that government agencies were granted. Information continued to come forward through many national news sources over the next several years about continuation of data collection programs carried out by government agencies. In 2013, former NSA whistle-blower, Edward Snowden, came forward with information about continued surveillance on US Citizens through the PRISM surveillance project, that allowed the NSA to collect communications from providers like Google Inc., Yahoo and Verizon among others. Collected data was stored in the NSA database Boundless Informant and collected through the NSA Analytical tool XKeyscore, which allowed for the collection of most any form of data, from emails, to social media, and web browsing history. Snowden's revelations and released documents detailed that the NSA's data collection programs were much broader, deeper, and insidious than previously released information had shown, and included collection of data even from users of Xbox Live, World of Warcraft and Second Life, as well as NSA agents spying on their own love interests. In 2014, former U.S. State Department whistle-blower, John Tye, wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post, outlining his concerns over data collection under Executive Order 12333. Part 2.3 (i) allows that \\"incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in activities that may violate federal, state, local or foreign laws\\" may be collected, retained and disseminated. In light of all of the information that came out over the previous 12‚Äì13 years, many states began invoking their Tenth Amendment rights to propose and enact Fourth Amendment Protection Acts in order to stop NSA collection within those states, or to disallow any unconstitutionally collected data to be utilized in state courts. Some states proposed actions to stop NSA Centers from accessing state controlled utilities, such as water and electricity, in an effort to block NSA data collections from within the state.  Fourth Amendment Protection Act By State = California = On January 6, 2014, the state of California proposed Senate Bill 828 (2013‚Äì14). It was introduced by senators Ted Lieu and Joel Anderson, with the intention of adding Chapter 32.5 (commencing with Section 7599) to the state government's code. Its intention aimed to prohibit providing any resources, participation, or aid of any sort to requests made by federal agencies that attempt to collect metadata by means in which the state finds illegal. Furthermore, it would prohibit agencies such as the NSA from using public universities as recruitment centers, as well as prohibiting such agencies from performing research on campus grounds. On November 30, 2014, it was approved by the governor and was accepted into California State law. = Washington = In the state of Washington, multiple bills have been proposed in order to offer protections from certain NSA data collection operations. Specifically, those conducted without warrants. In 2017, House Bill 1193 (2017-18) was introduced, and given its first reading on January 13. Its primary intention was to prevent the use of data and online information obtained without a proper warrant from being used as evidence against individuals being prosecuted in a court of law. It would also prohibit the utilization of state resources and services for data collection operations that the state deems unconstitutional. In addition, any persons or corporations found to have been providing services to federal agencies for unconstitutional purposes would be guilty of misdemeanors. As of 2018, the bill remains in committee. An earlier version of the bill was proposed in 2013 as House Bill 2272. = Arizona = Similar to California's Fourth Amendment Protection Act, Arizona State had also proposed their own protections under Senate Bill 1156 (2014). It was supported by many members of the Senate, including its president at the time, Andy Biggs. In Arizona, it would have prevented digital information obtained without a warrant from being used in court, prohibited federal agencies from using state funding to carry out data collection without proper warrants, and eliminated numerous gray areas not mentioned in the Fourth Amendment. It was intended to go into effect on January 1, 2015.title 41, chapter 9 by adding article 10; see bill text and other data on SB1156 at the Arizona legislature website. However, this bill did not pass.  Federal Level  On June 2, 2015, President Barack Obama signed a revised version of the USA Freedom Act. Under Section 215 the mass collection of phone data was no longer allowed. Phone records could now only be obtained through the Federal Courts. Companies also now had the ability to publicly report the number of records requests they had received, making it even harder for massive amounts of information to be requested. This was the first time such protections were added for citizens since the attacks on September 11, 2001. Many Americans had concerns after Snowden's information leaks, causing data privacy and security concerns to become much larger and widely discussed issues. Still, others in government, such as Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, were pushing for more terrorism protections and would realize that this bill, while losing some ground on their end, was still their best chance, as protections granted from the previous bill had already expired. Even as the Government was adding privacy protections, the advancements in technology were making surveillance practices easier. Devices such as satellites, cell phones, smart cars, smart-grid power reading, smart televisions, drones and automatic license place readers, to name a few, were becoming more and more prevalent in the surveillance world and the ways that information is gathered. New technology such as stingray surveillance technology is now used to create a more prominent signal for devices to gain connectivity to the internet, or cell phone towers, which, in turn, grants access to the information stored on connected devices. These types of devices have been used by many law enforcement agencies, growing the public's concern, and need for more privacy protection laws. Two large technology companies, Microsoft and Apple, were involved in litigation with the US Government in 2016 on the basis of protecting the privacy of their consumers. In February 2016 Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, filed a lawsuit against the US Government for breaking the US Constitution by not allowing Microsoft to \\"inform their customers when federal agencies sought their information.\\" Apple was involved in court proceedings in relations to a cell phone connected to a mass shooting in December 2015. The FBI was requesting that they unlock an encrypted cell phone so that they could gain access to the phone. This would have required Apple to write new software to bypass the password encryption on the phone. Apple felt that by doing this for this case, they would be opening this up for future cases, and removing the security of the password on the cell phones. The Supreme Court was involved in another case involving a string of robberies throughout Michigan and Ohio. A self-confessed robber in the case, gave the name and cell phone number of Timothy Carpenter to FBI agents, stating that he was involved. The FBI was able to use the location records of Timothy's cell phone to place him near the crimes, of which he was later convicted of aiding and abetting. His attorneys had argued that the cell phone records were not legally able to be used as evidence, due to lack of search warrant. However, the court had ruled that the cell phone data was not protected. After appeals, the final ruling was that \\"the records in this case fall on the unprotected side of the Fourth Amendment.\\" Chief Justice John Roberts was later quoted as saying, \\"[...]some of the courts most challenging cases involve applying long held rules created by the courts to quickly developing technology.\\" S. 139 was introduced on January 12, 2017, sponsored by Senator Orrin G. Hatch. The bill will continue Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that allows the NSA and FBI to further continue warrantless access to personal social media and conversation activities of foreigners to America, that also involves U.S citizens' private communications, for an additional six years. The S. 139 bill has made minor key changes to potentially enhance more effective ways to protect privacy in the United States while still tracking possible terrorist attacks. A few changes will now require the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to approve specified query procedures every year, as well as have the Inspector General of the Department of Justice over look the query procedures and practices of the FBI, and have limited use of Section 702 to not allow information found to be used against U.S citizens for criminal cases. Section 702 originally expired on December 31, 2017 but was then continued until January 19, 2018 where the vote ruled in favor of the extension by 256-164. President Donald Trump signed to enact S. 139 which became Public Law No: 115-118 that same day. On November 29, 2017 H.R. 4478 FISA Reauthorization Act of 2017, was introduced, sponsored by Republican Devin Nunes to extend Section 702. Representatives Justin Amish and Zoe Lofgren offered the USA Rights Act, pertaining a more balanced scale between security and liberty as this bill protects the 4th amendment along with eliminating the warrantless backdoor searches, that would then require government officials to obtain warrants in order to seize and view American citizens' data when the NSA and FBI tack into foreigner activities seeking any relations to terrorism. The bill resulted as a loss by a vote of 183-233.

She founded Sk√§nninge Abbey, a nunnery belonging to the Dominicans, in 1272. Her feast day is on September 2. Life Ingrid was the daughter of Elof, a nobleman from √ñsterg√∂tland. She was a member of the family Elofss√∂nernas √§tt, and belonged to the elite of the Swedish nobility. She had at least two brothers, Anders and Johan, the latter of whom was a knight of the Teutonic Order. Her niece, Kristina Johansdotter (d. 1293), was the first spouse of Birger Persson, who became the father of Bridget of Sweden in his second marriage. It is believed that Ingrid was an inspiration of Bridget. Ingrid married a nobleman referred to as Sir Sigge, who likely died in 1271. After being widowed, Ingrid and her sister Kristina became a part of a circle of pious females around the Dominican friar Petrus de Dacia in Sk√§nninge. In one of his letters, Petrus de Dacia has left a description of the ascetic life style and mystic revelations of one of his \\"spiritual daughters\\" in this circle of women, which likely refers to Ingrid.Ingrid Elofsdotter, urn:sbl:11967, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Jarl Gall√©n), h√§mtad 2015-04-13. In 1272, this circle of women formed an informal convent under the leadership of Ingrid by adopting the habit of the Dominicans and practicing its rules. Ingrid made pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela, Jerusalem and Rome. After the death of her sister, Ingrid applied for formal recognition of her convent. This was granted in 1281, a year before her death.  Veneration  After her death in 1282, Ingrid's remains became objects of veneration and pilgrimages to her convent. She was, however, not formally recognized by the Pope as a saint. When her relative, Bridget of Sweden, was formally canonized by Pope Boniface IX on 7 October 1391, it caused a need to have Ingrid recognized as a saint as well. At the Council of Costance, an application was made for the cause of her canonization. In 1499, Pope Alexander VI agreed to a translation of her remains, which took place in Sk√§nninge Abbey in 1507. Legacy Following the Swedish Reformation, the remains of Ingrid were removed to the Vadstena Abbey. In 1645, the skull was stolen from the Vadstena church by Antoine de Beaulieu, who believed it to be the skull of Bridget of Sweden. Antoine de Beaulieu gave Ingrid's skull to the French ambassador Gaspard Coignet de la Thullerie, who in turn placed it in the Church of Courson-les-Carri√®res in France. In 1959, it was given to the Bridgettine abbey of Mary's Refuge in Uden, The Netherlands, where it was exhibited as the skull of Bridget of Sweden.Birgittas stulna skalle, en kriminalg√•ta p√• v√§g att l√∂sas? - Barbro Lindqvist, SignumDNA skriver historia - Forskning & Framsteg References * Carlquist, Gunnar, red (1932).

Baxter offers the following argument: the second version is painted in a Cloisonnist style, giving it a stained glass window effect, a suitable medium for a Last Supper painting; and van Gogh has made a number of changes to the final version, most notably: adding bread and placing a new wine bottle before the central serving figure, giving it emphasis. Furthermore, van Gogh added more diners, including the figure hiding behind, what was once a vase of flowers, now appears to be a palm frond. Also, the flower arrangement on the left now resembles the top of a poll axe and is at about the same position where Simon Peter wields a blade in Leonardo da Vinci's version. But most importantly, right next to it, van Gogh has replicated Leonardo's leaning image of the apostle John, van Gogh's favorite.See Naifeh & Smith, 2011 Finally, van Gogh has enframed a female serving figure within vases of flowers, a motif he would return to months later with his Berceuse triptych.Van Uitert, Evert, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin in competition: Vincent‚Äôs original contribution, in Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 11, No. 2 (1980), pp. 81-106 And lastly, all the empty chairs, which can be immediately recognizable from Vincent‚Äôs Chair, also his Bedroom in Arles, and he'd just bought twelve to furnish the Yellow House literally hours before beginning his final Symbolist's Last Supper Caf√© Terrace at NightSee www.vangoghletters.org Letter 677, note 2 Notes References = Bibliography = * de la Faille, Jacob-BaartThe Works of Vincent van Gogh: His Paintings and Drawings.

The MSC was the dominant political force on the MCSC during this period, and Deschamps was aligned with the commission's leadership. In June 1986, a Quebec Superior Court judge questioned the \\"motives and objectivity\\" of three school commissioners, including Deschamps, who had voted to switch construction contracts from two firms to three other companies. The judge specifically criticized what he described as \\"the narrowness and the chauvinism\\" of Deschamps's motives.Debbie Parkes, \\"School contract switch irks judge,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 June 1986, D14.

Vision Montreal won a majority of council seats in this election, and Deschamps served as a backbench supporter of Pierre Bourque's administration. Deschamps held the largely ceremonial position of \\"pro-mayor\\" for a six-month term in early 1997. Beginning in January of that year, Bourque's leadership came under serious threat from dissident members of Vision Montreal; had he been forced to resign, Deschamps would have ascended to the position of mayor on a temporary basis.Peggy Curran, \\"Montreal at risk of drifting in perpetual political limbo,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 January 1997, A3.

The movements, made through shell corporations, were divided in portions of 1.5 million to avoid detection.

The judicial case was assigned to the judge Sebasti√°n Casanello, who ordered a search and seizure at the building. This was done several days after the airing of the TV program.

Whaley (born January 23, 1976) is an American politician and the mayor of Dayton, Ohio, having been elected in November 2013 following two City Commission terms. Personal life and education Whaley grew up in Indiana, but has lived in Ohio since attending the University of Dayton, where she earned her B.A. in Chemistry. Whaley also has a M.P.A. from Wright State University where she previously served as an Adjunct Professor. She is a member of Corpus Christi Catholic Church and a graduate of Leadership Miami Valley. In 1998, she settled in the Five Oaks neighborhood where she and her husband Sam reside today. Career Whaley was first elected to the Dayton City Commission in 2005, Nan was one of the youngest women ever chosen for a commission seat. Nan served on the Montgomery County Board of Elections and as a deputy to Montgomery County Auditor Karl Keith. Whaley was elected mayor of Dayton in 2013, winning 56 percent of the vote. In 2017, she was unopposed for reelection, making it the first uncontested mayoral race in the city‚Äôs history since voters have elected the office separately. Before her election as Mayor she served on Greater Ohio‚Äôs Community Revitalization Committee, the Learn to Earn Executive Committee for Education, the Montgomery County Planning Commission and the Dayton Access Television Board of Trustees. Early in her political career Whaley, while in college, was instrumental in reorganizing the College Democrats and later served as Ohio Chair of the College Democrats. Whaley is also a four-time delegate to the Democratic National Convention, worked for John Kerry's presidential campaign, and served as a presidential elector. Ahead of the 2018 election cycle, Whaley considered a run for Congress before declaring her candidacy for Governor of Ohio. On May 8, 2017, Whaley announced that she was running for Governor in the 2018 election on a platform of job creation. She dropped out of the race on January 12, 2018, and endorsed Richard Cordray. Mayoralty=Economic development= Early in her time in office, Whaley founded the Dayton Region Manufacturing Task Force, which is \\"a regional effort committed to advocating for manufacturing and promoting a strong manufacturing workforce.\\" Initiatives like this and a surge of high tech and research jobs have spurred $600,000,000 in investment in the region. Since Whaley was sworn into office on January 4, 2014, the unemployment rate in the City of Dayton has declined from 9.3% to 5.7%. In 2015, Site Selection magazine named Dayton, which has strong economic ties to the nearby Wright Patterson Air Force Base, the overall second-best mid-sized city for new business expansion projects in the nation. =Addressing opioids= In response to a statewide surge in opioid-related drug overdoses, Whaley declared a citywide state of emergency and developed a needle exchange program. Dayton also began to ensure that first-responders had access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. Whaley has been consistently critical of the Government of Ohio for failing to adequately fund opioid treatment and recovery programs. In 2017, Dayton was the fourth city in the country to sue the pharmaceutical companies, opioid drug distributors and physicians they say are responsible for Ohio's opioid addiction and overdose crisis. = City of Learners and the Preschool Promise = The City of Learners initiative was launched by Mayor Nan Whaley in early 2014 as a citywide effort to support Dayton's schools and students in achieving new levels of success and to build a stronger workforce for the future. A committee of community leaders and volunteers identified five areas of community focus: ensure all children attend a high quality school, ensure high quality preschool is offered to all children, increase business partnerships with schools, provide mentors to more children, and expand sites for afterschool and summer learning. In 2016, the City of Dayton voters passed a 0.25% income tax increase to support critical city services and to offer 1 year of affordable, quality Preschool to all Dayton families with a 4-year-old. This move institutionalized Preschool Promise in Dayton and provides sustained funding. =Downtown revitalization= Whaley has placed significant emphasis on reviving the economy and culture of the Downtown Dayton area. She has done so through drawing in over $200,000,000 in downtown investments and in a refocus of the region into new ventures; she has focused especially on the Arcade Building. As a result of some new renewal efforts, new businesses have begun to move into the downtown area, including a number of small businesses and startups. =Accessibility= As a previous board member of the Bike Walk Dayton Committee, Whaley has taken significant steps towards making Dayton a bicycle friendly community. For instance, her administration oversaw the implementation of Dayton's first Bike Share program. She is also a strong advocate for a county-wide landbank system to address the region‚Äôs housing crisis with a more regional approach and serves on the Montgomery County Landbank Board. =2019 mass shooting= After a mass shooting occurred on August 4, 2019, she and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown accompanied President Donald Trump on a visit with survivors at the local hospital. Ten people were killed, including the perpetrator; and twenty-seven were injured. She joined over 200 mayors in encouraging Congress to act on gun control legislation that is already before them. The group included Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, Texas, where a shooting occurred the day before.

Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 539-540 Allen Lane 2012 History and pedigree As a complex hybrid, Landal noir inherited genes from several Vitis vine varieties including Vitis berlandieri. Landal noir was created by Pierre Landot during a series of trials between 1929 and 1942 at her Ain nursery in the commune of Conzieu. The grape is a complex hybrid with a lineage that includes members of several species of the genus Vitis beginning with its parent varieties, the Seibel grapes Plantet (Seibel 5455) and Seibel 8216. From its parent Plantet (a Seibel 4461 x Berlandieri crossing), Landal noir inherited genes from the Vitis berlandieri, Vitis vinifera (through great-grand parent Bourboulenc and great-great grandparent Aramon), Vitis aestivalis, Vitis cinerea and Vitis rupestris species.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Plantet Accessed: January 8th, 2014Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Seibel 4461 Accessed: January 8th, 2014Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Vivarais Accessed: January 8th, 2014 From parent Seibel 8216 (a Seibel 5410 x Florental crossing), Landal noir is related to several other Seibel grape varieties including Cinsaut Seibel (Seibel 2510) and Seibel 867 (a crossing of Noah and Vivarais). Viticulture Landal noir is an early ripening and early budding grape variety that is very winter hardy and is able to withstand cold temperatures and spring frosts. Unlike many other hybrid varieties and despite having genes from several native North American vine species in its lineage, Landal noir is still susceptible to the viticultural hazard of phylloxera which means that plantings of the grape need to be grafted onto resistant rootstock. The vine tends to be very vigorous, producing a large canopy, and fertile, capable of producing high yields of small clusters of similarly small berries. Wine regions The Vend√©e of western France where some plantings of Landal noir are still cultivated. While Landal noir is still an authorized grape variety for several French wine regions (none of which is making Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wines which is prohibited from using hybrid grapes under French wine laws), the variety is not officially recommended for use in any quality wine production. Plantings of the grape have been steadily declining for decades with only reported in 2008, mostly concentrated in the Loire Valley and Vend√©e department. Outside France there were of Landal noir planted in the Canton of Geneva in Switzerland. In North America, the grape was first planted in Ontario during the 1980s with small plantings still there and in Quebec. In Pennsylvania, the grape is often used as a blending variety with the French-American hybrid grape Chambourcin.

He was also implicated in a number of corruption scandals. She attended Mount Carmel High School in Mumbai. She obtained a degree in medicine from King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College. Career Khobragade joined the Indian Foreign Service in 1999. In 2012, she was posted to the Consulate General of India in New York where she worked as Deputy Consul General till December 2013. She handled women's affairs as well as political and economic issues. As acting Consul General, she provided her personal perspective on Women's Rights and the Influence of Demographics in India at the Australian Consulate-General in New York in April 2013. On 20 January 2014 she was posted to New Delhi as director of the Development Partnership Administration (DPA), an agency formed in 2013 at the Ministry of External Affairs to handle India's projects overseas. In December 2014 the Ministry of External Affairs removed her from this post and placed her on \\"compulsory wait\\". In July 2015 she was reinstated as a director in the Ministry of External Affairs, this time in its State Governments division. She chose to work with Kerala, aiming to promote its interests overseas in areas like investment, culture, tourism and the well being of its large diaspora in the Gulf countries. Khobragade was selected for the Chevening Rolls-Royce scholarship in 2012. She was appointed Ambassador to Cambodia on 2 October 2020. Personal life Khobragade is married to an American citizen, New York-born Dr. Aakash Singh Rathore, who is research professor at University of Luiss, Rome, Italy. Since Rathore is a foreign national married to an Indian diplomat, he has applied for Indian citizenship which has not yet been granted since he has not completed the required domicile period in India. The couple have two daughters, who were ages 7 and 4 in 2013. Khobragade's father, Uttam, was an officer in the Indian Administrative Service. Controversies Besides Devyani Khobragade incident, her name is mostly in news with her father Uttam Khobragade for Adarsh Housing Society scam =United States visa fraud= On 12 December 2013, Devyani Khobragade, India's Deputy Consul General at its diplomatic mission in New York City at that time, was arrested on charges of visa fraud and perjury under Title 28, United States Code, Section 1746. This incident led to a major diplomatic standoff between India and the United States. =Adarsh Housing Society scam= Devyani Khobragade and her father Uttam Khobragade owned a flat in the Adarsh Housing Society. A government investigation and subsequent media coverage described false statements that she was made to acquire the flat as part of the Adarsh Housing Society scam. =Undue favours in her postings= There is a clear finding by the Supreme Court of India that Ms. Devyani Khobragade was given a posting of her choice in the Indian Foreign Service by bending and modifying the specific rules of allocation for the specific year of 1999 where she was ranked lower than a meritorious batch mate of hers, Mr. Mahaveer C Singhvi. The finding appears in the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in a case filed by the victim batch mate against the vendetta activities of the Ministry of External Affairs effecting his service in the case of Union of India v Mahaveer C Singhvi. The Supreme Court of India in its Judgment stated \\"The mode of allotment was amended for the 1999 Batch in such a calculated fashion that Ms. Khobragade, who was at Serial No.7, was given her choice of German over and above the Respondent who was graded at two stages above her.\\" = Children's Dual Citizenship = After her return to India in December 2013, Devyani Khobragade was asked to deposit her children's passports with the Ministry of External Affairs. It was at this time Khobragade revealed that her children had passports from two countries, India and the United States. The ministry instated a panel headed by the Ministry's Joint Secretary of Cypher, NGO and Vigilance (CNV), A.K. Chatterjee to determine whether she had violated Central Civil Services Conduct rules. After a nine-month enquiry, the panel ruled against her and found her guilty of \\"serious misconduct\\". In another administrative action, the ministry revoked the children's Indian passports. Khobragade filed a petition in Delhi High Court against this action, arguing that though Indian law forbids dual citizenship, it is permitted for minors. Legal opinion holds that though minors are allowed to hold dual citizenship once they reach the age of majority (18 years), they have 6 months in which to decide which citizenship to go with. If they fail to make the decision within that timeframe, they automatically lose Indian citizenship. It is unclear, however, whether it is legal for minors to hold both a foreign passport and an Indian passport. In May 2015, Justice Shakdher of the Delhi High Court put a hold on revoking the passports and asked the Ministry of External Affairs to explain to the court why it took this administrative action. In a legal response to the Delhi High Court, the Ministry of External Affairs claimed that Khobragade obtained these passports for her children in violation of Indian law and without informing the ministry, thus raising questions about her \\"trustworthiness and integrity\\". The ministry claimed that Khobragade obtained Indian diplomatic passports for her daughters by \\"suppressing material facts\\" which established that she \\"wilfully and blatantly violated the Indian Passport Act\\". The ministry rejected Khobragade's petition for dual citizenship on the grounds that it is only applicable to those children who were born outside India. As Khobragade's children were born in India they do not qualify for dual citizenship. By acquiring US passports, the children had acquired US citizenship and would require a visa to travel to India, which the ministry would be willing to grant should the need arise. Other In 2016, she published a book, The White Sari.

Raised in 1940, the battalion served in the Middle East during the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign against the Vichy French in mid-1941, fighting mainly as infantry. In 1942, the battalion was committed to the defence of Java, fighting against the Japanese and was all but destroyed following the capitulation of the defending garrison. Rebuilt in 1943, it later took part in the Salamaua‚ÄìLae and Finisterre Range campaigns in 1943‚Äì44 and the Borneo campaign in 1945 before being disbanded. History Formed in May 1940 at Puckapunyal, Victoria, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Wellington, the battalion was one of four pioneer battalions raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force during World War II. The concept of pioneer battalions had originally been explored by the Australians during World War I, when five such battalions were formed and utilised as support troops assigned at divisional level on the Western Front. Notionally organised along a traditional infantry structure, pioneer battalions consisted of a headquarters and four companies, and were expected to serve to undertake minor engineering tasks during combat in order to free up trained engineers for more complex tasks. Within the divisional structure, the pioneers were administered as corps troops under the direction of the divisional engineer commander. After completing initial training, the 2/2nd Pioneers embarked upon the Queen Mary in April 1941 and sailed for the Middle East. After arriving in Egypt in May, the battalion eventually served in Syria and Palestine, assigned to the 7th Division, fighting against the Vichy French during the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign, where they fought mainly as infantry. The battalion had not been fully trained in this role and had not received all the equipment required, lacking mortars and possessing only a small number of automatic weapons, and lacking some of the specialist troops of established infantry battalions, including an intelligence section. Nevertheless, it was committed to several attacks, including a two company frontal assault on Fort Merdjayoun on 17 June, which resulted in heavy casualties with 27 killed, 46 wounded, and 29 being taken prisoner. Further actions followed around Merdjayoun, El Mtolle and Damour before the Vichy French defenders capitulated in July. Casualties throughout the whole campaign amounted to 14 officers and 161 other ranks killed or wounded. Pioneers from the 2/2nd digging-in, Syria, November 1941. Following the completion of the fighting in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneers undertook training and garrison duties moving between several locations including Damour, Tripoli, Fort Legout, and then Qatana. In 1942, following Japan's entry into the war, the 2/2nd was ordered to return to Australia, embarking upon the troopship Orcades. En route, they were diverted, however, along with other elements of the 7th Division to defend Java against the Japanese, landing there in late February 1942 and joining \\"Blackforce\\" under the command of Brigadier Arthur Blackburn. There, during the Netherlands East Indies campaign, the 2/2nd Pioneers took part in a brief, but bitter engagement before being ordered to surrender; a large number of the 2/2nd's personnel were captured ‚Äì over 800 men ‚Äì of whom 258 later died in captivity. Dispatched across south-east Asia, the men were used as forced labour on the Burma- Thailand railway, and in camps on Java and Borneo. A small number of personnel who had been in the battalion's rear detail, managed to avoid capture having been routed separately from the Middle East. Returning to Australia, initially they were to be redistributed to other units, but eventually the decision was made to reform the 2/2nd and throughout the remainder of 1942 and into 1943 the battalion was rebuilt from this cadre. In June 1943, the 2/2nd Pioneers were deployed to New Guinea undertaking both traditional infantry and engineering tasks. Assigned once again to the 7th Division, they saw combat in the Markham‚ÄìRamu Valley, advancing overland from Tsili Tsili, and constructing an airfield after the Landing at Nadzab. They were then re-roled as infantry and joined the drive on Lae alongside Australian and US forces. They remained in New Guinea, taking part in the advance into the Finisterres, including the fighting around Shaggy Ridge, until early 1944 when they returned to Australia for rest and reorganisation. The battalion's final involvement in the war came in mid-1945 when it deployed to support both the 7th and 9th Divisions in Operation Oboe as part of the 2nd Beach Group. In this role they participated in both the Battle of Tarakan and the Battle of Balikpapan during the Borneo campaign. During this campaign, the battalion was used primarily as a labour force around the beachhead, unloading stores and equipment, maintaining defensive positions and guarding prisoners. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, the battalion was disbanded in late 1945. The 2/2nd's casualties during the war amounted to 394 killed in action or died on active service, and 121 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Distinguished Service Orders, five Officers of the Order of the British Empire, two Military Crosses, two British Empire Medals, 13 Military Medals and 13 Mentions in Despatches. After the war, the functions of the pioneers were subsumed into traditional infantry battalions, which each raised a platoon of assault pioneers within their support companies. As a result, no pioneer battalions have been re-raised in the Australian Army since the end of World War II. Battle honours For the service during World War II, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was awarded the following battle honours: * Syria 1941, Merjayun, Damour, Mazaraat ech Chouf, South-West Pacific 1942‚Äì1945, Lae‚ÄìNadzab, Lae Road, Liberation of Australian New Guinea, Ramu Valley, Shaggy Ridge, Java 1942.

He is the narrator of the unabridged audiobook editions of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Life and career Inglis was born in Australia but has lived and worked in England for many years. As of 2012, he lives in Somers Town, a district in central London. His plays include Voyage of the Endeavour (1965), based on the journal of Captain James Cook; Canterbury Tales (1968), dramatised readings from Chaucer; Erf (1971), a one-actor play about the twenty-first century; A Rum Do (1970), a musical based on the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie; and Men Who Shaped Australia, for Better or for Worse (1968), a one-actor play dealing with significant historical figures. His more recent works include a play about Lisa Pontecorvo, the daughter of geneticist Guido Pontecorvo, it played in small theatres and community centres around England in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, he was awarded a ¬£16,000 Arts Council grant to write Regent's Canal, a Folk Opera, a musical that celebrates the 200th anniversary of the digging of the eight-mile Regent's Canal. He has adapted works to stage for one-man performances of A Christmas Carol (1983), and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, for which Inglis was called \\"one of the wonders of the Fringe.\\" He has also adapted Chaucer, Shakespeare, Tolkien and Orwell to one act performances. Inglis has appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Court Theatre, playing characters such as the Ghost and Claudius in Hamlet and Mr. Bumble in Oliver!. Inglis' TV appearances including as Ned Kelly in The Stringybark Massacre (short, 1968); as Chief sub in Play for Today (TV series, 1978/79); as Professor Doom in Wizbit (TV series, 1986); as Alan Clark in Casualty (TV series, 2002). Inglis has narrated audiobooks by Tolkien (described below), and the first three books by Ursula K. Le Guin in the Earthsea Cycle. Tolkien works In the 1970s and 80s, Inglis wrote, produced and acted in one-man stage dramatisations of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. These performances have been described as \\"award winning\\". It was through his one-man stage adaptions that he was noticed by Recorded Books and asked to narrate an unabridged edition of Lord of the Rings (1990) and soon after The Hobbit (1991). It was one of Recorded Books best-selling titles however prior to 2012 it was only available on physical media (CD-ROM or tape) at which point it was released in digital format. Laura Miller of Salon.com said :\\"Inglis strikes precisely the right note in his narration. It is an old- fashioned audiobook narration, one that feels more read than performed, although the voices of the many characters are all well-developed. It's ever so slightly prosy, and the sensation conveyed is exactly like listening to a favourite relative read to a beloved child the same book he (beautifully) read to you when you were a child.\\" Until Andy Serkis' 2020 recording,'The Hobbit' is getting a new audiobook edition read by Andy Serkis Inglis' reading of The Hobbit was the only unabridged edition of the book ever made. The J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia (2006) called it a \\"remarkable performance in which he provides distinctive voices for the various characters and sings the songs in the story\\". The encyclopaedia says of The Lord of the Rings, \\"his voices for the characters are less dramatic and there are no sound effects\\". In a 2001 AudioFile interview, Inglis says they recorded Lord of the Rings in an \\"intense\\" six-week period in 1990 at the New York studio of Recorded Books. They then recorded The Hobbit about a year later. Inglis prepared with guidance from acting colleges in dramatic societies to perfect the many character voices. Inglis says, \\"There is much in the original writing that suggests how a character should be brought to life. It's quite strange. At times it felt like Tolkien himself was talking to me through his prose, telling me how things should be.\\" Inglis says he composed some of the music for the songs himself, some music was composed by Tolkien, and Claudia Howard of Recorded Books composed the rest.

Though designated as the 32nd Regiment, Louisiana Volunteers, it never used the specified name.Guide to Louisiana Confederate Military Units, 1861-1865, pp. 144-145. Unlike most Civil War formations, it was a combined arms force composed of more than one type of unit. In this particular case, it was organized as a battalion of seven infantry companies and another of five companies of cavalry at Port Hudson, Louisiana, in the early summer of 1862 under the command of Colonel William R. Miles. The infantrymen were recruited from Livingston, Orleans and Tangipahoa Parishes. The cavalry draw its ranks from East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, and St. Tammany Parishes. In April 1862, a \\"William Bradley\\" joined Company G at Natchez, Mississippi, however, the soldier was discharged in June when it was discovered that Bradley was a woman. In action In April and May 1863, 2400 Legion soldiers, including 300 cavalrymen, were assigned to help try to stop Grierson's Raid from reaching Baton Rouge. Miles' Legion fought in the Siege of Port Hudson under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick B. Brand. During the Battle of Plains Store on May 21, 1863, Confederate and Union forces had already fought and disengaged by the time Colonel Miles arrived with reinforcements from Port Hudson. Nevertheless, late in the day, Miles launched an attack, with some initial success, but was eventually forced to retreat by a counterattack. The unit suffered 89 casualties. On May 26, the infantrymen clashed with the men of the 116th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The following day, the unit manned artillery pieces on the battle line. Along with the rest of the defenders, the battalion surrendered on July 9, 1863. Victorious General Nathaniel P. Banks paroled the enlisted men, but the officers were made prisoners of war. Though the officers were eventually exchanged, the infantry battalion was not reformed. The cavalry battalion continued to fight in Mississippi and Louisiana under Major James T.

The Fort Lee lane closure scandal, also known as the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal or Bridgegate, was a political scandal involving a staff member and political appointees of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie colluding to create traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey, by closing lanes at the main toll plaza for the upper level of the George Washington Bridge. The problems began on Monday, September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning rush hour. Local officials, emergency services, and the public were not notified of the lane closures, which Fort Lee declared a threat to public safety. The resulting back-ups and gridlock on local streets ended only when the two lanes were reopened on Friday, September 13, 2013, by an order from Port Authority Executive Director and Democrat from New York, Patrick Foye. He said that the \\"hasty and ill-informed decision\\" could have endangered lives and violated federal and state laws. It was later suggested that the lanes had been closed intentionally to cause the massive traffic problem for political reasons, and especially theorized that they were a retributive attack against Fort Lee's Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who had not supported Christie as a candidate in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election. The ensuing investigations centered on several of Christie's appointees and staff, including David Wildstein, who ordered the lanes closed, and Bill Baroni, who had told the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee that the closures were for a traffic study. The United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey Paul J. Fishman launched a federal investigation, resulting in a sweeping nine-count indictment against Bridget Anne Kelly, the deputy chief of staff, Baroni and Wildstein.Seidman, Andrew. \\"Paul Fishman, U.S. attorney for New Jersey, offers no wider opinion on Bridgegate\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer (May 19, 2015). Wildstein entered a guilty plea, and testified against Baroni and Kelly, who were found guilty on all counts in November 2016. David Samson pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy in July 2016, for acts unrelated to the lane closures but unearthed by the federal Bridgegate investigation. Christie's political standing was badly damaged by the scandal, and his approval ratings from the scandal onward only continued to fall.(Poll conducted February 4‚Äì9, 2014)(Poll conducted January 31 to February 2, 2014) Once considered a leading contender for the 2016 Republican nomination for President, Christie dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. The scandal was widely cited as a major factor in the early demise of Christie's 2016 presidential ambitions. \\"Christie's stature within the party has dipped in his second term as governor, particularly since the \\"Bridgegate\\" scandal.\\" \\"the damage from \\"Bridgegate\\" had many wondering whether his campaign was dead from the start.\\" \\"for a guy who rose to political prominence as a corruption-busting truth- teller, the scandal was anti-brand, damaging his image beyond repair.\\" \\"Chris Christie's name has tumbled off the list of top-tier presidential candidates. ... For Mr. Christie, the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge are a weight tethering his political ambitions to the ground.\\" \\"the truth of what happened to Christie... is that he never had a chance... when people working in his administration... closed some entrance lanes to the George Washington Bridge.\\" Christie called Bridgegate \\"a factor\\" in why he was bypassed by Donald Trump as the vice presidential nominee. In September 2016, both the prosecution and the defense in the trial of two of Christie's former aides argued that Christie knew of his close associates' involvement in a plan to shut down lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as it was happening, and that the closings were to punish Sokolich for declining to support Christie's reelection bid. This was the first time Christie had been officially accused of contemporaneous knowledge of the plot. The defendants in the case appealed their convictions. In June 2019, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and heard the case in January 2020. One defendant, already serving his prison term, asked for immediate release. On May 7, 2020 the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the convictions.U.S. Supreme Court throws out Bridgegate convictions, 6 years after an epic traffic jam NJ.com 7 May 2020 Background Fort Lee to Manhattan The George Washington Bridge, a double-decked toll bridge, is the busiest motor-vehicle bridge in the world, with a toll charge for traffic from New Jersey to New York. At the time, there were 29 operating toll lanes, spread among three toll plazas. At the main toll plaza for the upper level, there were twelve toll lanes and a Fort Lee entrance at Martha Washington Way (also called Park Avenue). During rush hours, for the previous 30 years or longer, the three lanes located furthest to the right (the south end of the toll plaza) were ordinarily reserved for local traffic entering from Fort Lee and the surrounding communities. This local traffic was segregated by movable traffic cones from the heavier traffic of the major highways. There were other Fort Lee street entrances, which did not have dedicated toll lanes, to the lower and upper levels of the bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ or simply the PA), the owner of the bridge, was overseen by a Board of Commissioners. Under an informal power-sharing agreement, the Governor of New Jersey chose the chairman of the board and the deputy executive director, while the Governor of New York chose the vice-chairman and executive director. Chris Christie, a Republican, was first elected Governor of New Jersey in November 2009 and re- elected in November 2013. During his first term, he appointed Bill Baroni as deputy executive director of the PA. David Wildstein, a local politician and political blogger who had known Christie during high school, was hired by Baroni based on Christie's referral and recommendation in May 2010. As director of interstate capital projects, Wildstein was New Jersey's second highest executive at the Port Authority, and often substituted for Baroni at major meetings. Events During the week of August 4, 2013, Christie met with David Samson, Christie's appointed chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority. The deputy speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, John Wisniewski, who, as chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee had been leading the Assembly's investigation into the closures, alleged that David Wildstein, the Christie appointee who ordered the closures, must have believed the meeting was related to the lane closures, because a reference to the meeting was included in the subpoenaed documents Wildstein submitted in which all information not pertaining to the Fort Lee lane closures had been redacted. On August 13, Bridget Anne Kelly, deputy chief of staff in Christie's office, sent an eight-word e-mail to David Wildstein that read, \\"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\\" Wildstein responded to Kelly's e-mail: \\"Got it.\\" On September 6, Wildstein instructed George Washington Bridge manager Robert Durando not to tell anyone in Fort Lee about the upcoming closure, not even the police. When Durando questioned the order, which he thought was \\"odd\\" since he had never been instructed in his 35-year career not to tell host town officials about an event that would disrupt traffic, Wildstein told him \\"it would impact the study\\" if people knew and Wildstein \\"wanted to see what would naturally happen\\". Wildstein sent an e-mail the same day to Kelly informing her that Christie had approved $60,000 to fund a traffic study for Springfield in Union County. The Democratic mayor, David Amlen, did not endorse Christie for re-election and was not informed of the approval of their requested traffic study until after Christie won re- election. =Closure= On Monday, September 9, 2013, prior to the morning rush hour on the first day of the school year, two of the three dedicated toll lanes at one of the Fort Lee entrances to the upper level of the GW Bridge were closed to local use, and were reallocated to the main highway traffic, on orders from Wildstein without notification to Fort Lee government and police officials. In an area that normally experiences a great deal of traffic, the lane closings caused a significant increase in traffic congestion. This led to major delays for school transportation and police and emergency responses within Fort Lee, both during and after the peak hours of travel. Includes composite aerial images with illustrated versions of GW Bridge traffic flow around the upper-level toll plaza with one and three dedicated local toll lanes. According to the Fort Lee emergency medical services coordinator, traffic jams delayed paramedic response times, including a 9-1-1 call for Florence Genova, who subsequently died of cardiac arrest. In January 2014, her daughter told The New York Times that she \\"wants to stay out of it. It's not political\\". She noted her mother's advanced age (91) and opined that \\"it was just her time\\". In at least one instance, emergency medical workers were forced to leave their ambulance and respond on foot because traffic congestion was so heavy. Emergency responders were delayed nearly one hour in rendering assistance to a man experiencing chest pains. Within hours of the closure, various Port Authority officials were being told that the traffic delays posed a threat to public safety. At 9:29 a.m., Matthew Bell, a special assistant to Bill Baroni, e-mailed Baroni regarding \\"urgent matter of public safety in Fort Lee\\". Fort Lee Borough Administrator Peggy Thomas e-mailed the PA's director of government and community relations, Tina Lado, with her concerns, noting that police and emergency departments received no advance notice of the closures. At 11:24 a.m., Lado e-mailed both Wildstein and Baroni informing them that due to the closures, police and ambulances were having difficulty responding to emergencies. That e-mail noted two specific incidents: a missing child (later found) and a cardiac arrest. These safety warnings were reportedly ignored. At the federal trial of Baroni and Kelly, Fort Lee Police Chief Keith Bendul testified that he had reached Durando on that Monday, who asked for a meeting not at the PA office, but in a nearby municipal parking lot. \\"I thought it was cloak and dagger.\\" Durando spoke of the traffic study, and Bendul demanded its ending, citing the various safety problems. \\"I told [Durando] bluntly that if anybody dies, I'm going to tell those people to sue him and everybody at the Port Authority.\\" A nervous Durando told Bendul that Sokolich should contact Baroni, and added that \\"if anybody asked if this meeting occurred, he [Durando] would deny it\\", Bendul testified. Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly e-mailed Wildstein and asked about his response, if any, to Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. Wildstein responded: \\"Radio silence. His name comes right after Mayor Fulop [of Jersey City].\\" PAPD Lieutenant Thomas \\"Chip\\" Michaels, a Christie childhood friend, ordered his subordinates not to touch the cones, and chauffeured Wildstein around the Fort Lee area on an observation tour, and updated Wildstein on traffic conditions throughout the week, via text messages. On Tuesday, September 10, Sokolich texted Baroni: \\"Presently we have four very busy traffic lanes merging into only one toll booth ... bigger problem is getting kids to school. Help please. It's maddening.\\" Kelly's text message exchange with Wildstein referred to the mayor's message. Kelly asked, \\"Is it wrong that I am smiling?\\" Wildstein replied, \\"No.\\" Kelly then wrote, \\"I feel badly about the kids. I guess.\\" Wildstein responded, \\"They are the children of Buono voters\\", referring to Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in the November election. Twelve-year veteran PAPD Officer Steve Pisciotta was stationed near the affected entrance, and reported over his radio about hazardous conditions created by the severe traffic. PAPD Deputy Inspector Darcy Licorish radioed back, \\"Shut up\\", and that there should be no over-the-air discussion of the closure. Lt. Michaels and PAPD Sgt. Nadine Rhem later visited Pisciotta in person, warning that his communication was inappropriate. On Wednesday, September 11, Robert Durando said in a Port Authority e-mail that if the automated toll lanes were closed permanently in favor of one manned lane for local traffic, it would be \\"very expensive\\" since annual toll-collector costs would increase approximately $600,000. This would have covered overtime, as well as stationing reserve employees when a scheduled toll collector was not able to work. He said there would be additional, but still to be determined costs, for PA police due to their coverage of traffic for a greatly extended rush hour. Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed together at the site of the World Trade Center during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. On that occasion, Wildstein later testified, Baroni sarcastically told Christie, \\"Governor, there is a tremendous amount of traffic in Fort Lee, please know Mayor Sokolich is frustrated he can't get his calls returned\\", to which Christie was said to have responded, \\"I imagine they wouldn't be getting their calls returned.\\" According to Wildstein, Baroni then told Christie that Wildstein would monitor the traffic, and Christie responded, \\"Well, I'm sure Mr. Edge wouldn't be involved in anything political\\", and laughed. (\\"Wally Edge\\" was the pseudonymous persona used by Wildstein in his earlier highly political blog.) On Thursday, September 12, PA engineers said that reported delays for local traffic greatly exceeded any time savings for the major highway traffic based on reported information for vehicle travel times on Interstate 95 and local traffic counts from that week. In an internal PowerPoint presentation, it was estimated that the extra daily morning rush hour time, 2,800 vehicle-hours, endured by local traffic on a typical day greatly outweighed time savings, 966 vehicle-hours, for the I-95 traffic. Sokolich wrote to Baroni that \\"many members of the public have informed me that the PA police officers are advising commuters ... that this recent traffic debacle is the result of a decision that I, as the Mayor, recently made.\\" According to his later testimony, John Ma (the chief of staff to the Port Authority's executive director, Patrick Foye), with Foye's knowledge beforehand, tipped off John Cichowski, the \\"Road Warrior\\" columnist for The Record. \\"I told him, off the record, that to my knowledge there was no traffic study and that the lane closures had been ordered by David Wildstein.\\" Cichowski contacted the PA to ask about the delays, and this contact appeared on that evening's internal PA report of media contacts, getting the attention of Foye. =Re-opening and immediate aftermath= On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, Patrick Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority and an appointee of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44a.m. e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes \\"hasty and ill-advised\\", said that the decision violated policy and long- standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes \\"violates Federal Law and the laws of both States\\". Foye asked his spokesman to get the word out. Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark. Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye. Foye would later testify that Baroni met with him two times on that Friday, pressing for reinstatement of the closure, saying it was \\"important to Trenton\\", or else \\"Trenton\\" would call, which Foye understood to mean Christie's office. \\"I said they should call\\", Foye testified. \\"I opened [the lanes], I was not closing them.\\" However, Foye did approve a press release that he knew falsely cited a \\"traffic study\\". During and after the lane closures, \\"hundreds of pages of e-mails and internal documents\\" showed \\"how Christie loyalists inside the PA worked to orchestrate a cover-up after traffic mayhem\\" in Fort Lee. In September, as more reporters began asking about the GW Bridge problems, officials conferred on how to respond. On September 13, The Record reported the outrage commuters were expressing toward the PA following days of long, inbound delays, and Fort Lee officials' unsuccessful efforts to get an explanation. Then on September 16, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked PA spokesman Coleman about what had occurred after some Journal editors had been in traffic the previous week. \\"Coleman passed the query up the chain of command\\" and Wildstein forwarded it to Baroni, commenting \\"I call bullshit on this.\\" Further inquiries were directed by Coleman to Baroni and Wildstein, asking how they wanted the PA to respond, and Wildstein forwarded one of these inquiries to Christie's press secretary and chief spokesman, Michael Drewniak. Coleman also wrote to Baroni and Wildstein, \\"I will not respond unless instructed to do so.\\" On September 17, Wildstein informed Baroni that he had received a call from Wall Street Journal reporter Tedd Mann. \\"Jesus\\", Baroni replied, \\"Call Drewniak\\". The e-mails showed efforts by Christie appointees in the PA and his office in Trenton to respond to the aftermath and media inquiries for the toll lane closures. The participants included Baroni, Wildstein, and PA Chairman Samson, as well as Drewniak and Maria Comella, Communications Director. In a September 18 e-mail, Samson warned that Foye is \\"playing in traffic, made a big mistake\\" in response to a leak to The Wall Street Journal for their September 17 story citing unnamed PA officials as saying the decision to close the toll lanes had caused tensions within the bi- state agency. In other communications, officials used an ethnic pejorative to refer to the Fort Lee mayor. In an e-mail from Wildstein responding to Bill Stepien, he said \\"It will be a tough November for this little Serbian\\", derogatorily referring to Sokolich, who is Croatian-American. Baroni referred to \\"Serbia\\" in text messages in another apparent reference to Mayor Sokolich. Sokolich told The Huffington Post: \\"That slight is offensive to me, and it's offensive to me of everyone of Serbian background. If I were Serbian, I would be absolutely, positively appalled by it.\\" The Serbian remarks received the attention of Serbian and Croatian media, and was commented upon by the Serbian government's Office for Cooperation with the Diaspora and Serbs in the Region. On October 9, Philippe Danielides, a senior adviser to Samson, e-mailed Wildstein a daily news summary and asked \\"Has any thought been given to writing an op-ed or providing a statement about the GWB study? Or is the plan just to hunker down and grit our way through it?\\" Wildstein replied \\"Yes and yes\\" and forwarded these e-mails to Baroni. Wildstein sought advice from Drewniak, with the two meeting in person on December 4. On December 6, Wildstein announced he would resign at the end of the year, saying the response to the traffic lanes closure had become \\"a distraction\\". At a December 13 press conference, Christie announced the immediate resignations of Baroni and Wildstein. David Samson allegations In the wake of the lane closings, the Port Authority's chairman David Samson was the subject of media reports alleging ethical violations and conflicts of interest. It was alleged that Samson's law firm and their clients profited from dealings with the Port Authority and from projects involving New Jersey government financing or tax incentives. It was also reported that Christie benefited politically and his allies benefited financially during Samson's term as chairman. Patrick Foye, the Port Authority's executive director, asserted that Samson lacked the moral authority to run the agency. Calls for Samson's resignation or removal came from New Jersey officials and media sources, including The Star-Ledger, The Daily News (New York), The Record, and The New York Times. On March 4, the freeholders in Bergen County, where Fort Lee is located, called for the resignation of Samson and the other five New Jersey appointed commissioners, with the commissioners faulted for failure to exercise proper oversight. In February 2014, Christie stood firmly behind his support of Samson as PA chairman. On March 28, 2014, Christie announced that Samson had offered his resignation from the Port Authority, effective immediately. They both agreed with the recommended Port Authority reforms in the March 26 report commissioned by the governor's office for an investigation of Bridgegate allegations. The report did not mention any involvement by Samson (who had refused to be interviewed) in any Bridgegate events, or any of the other allegations during his role as PA chairman. On April 29, 2014, Christie nominated John J. Degnan, a former state attorney general, as Samson's replacement, later confirmed by the New Jersey state senate. On July 14, 2016, Samson pleaded guilty to a felony for conspiring to impede an airplane hangar project that was important to United Airlines in order to force the airline to reinstate a discontinued flight from Newark Airport to Columbia, South Carolina. U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman declined to say whether Samson would be cooperating in the Bridgegate case.Matt Friedman, \\"Christie ally David Samson pleads guilty in United probe\\", July 14, 2016, Politico.com, at . Possible motives The Modern high-rise residential building under construction at the Hudson Lights redevelopment. Looking east from George Washington Bridge Plaza. The May 2015 indictments of Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly contend that the lane closures were political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not supporting Christie in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election. Sokolich initially claimed that he was asked for an endorsement once, in the spring of 2013, months before the August \\"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\\" e-mail by Bridget Kelly to David Wildstein. Although the two men are from different parties and an endorsement would normally not be expected, Christie ran on a platform of bipartisanship and had secured the endorsement of many other Democratic officials. In an interview on February 6, 2014, with The Record, Sokolich said that the Christie administration had courted his endorsement over a period of time going back to around 2010, when Christie invited Sokolich and a handful of other mayors, including Hoboken's Dawn Zimmer, to have lunch at the governor's mansion in Princeton. Christie was shown in a picture talking with local mayors in a lineup, including Sokolich, after a news conference in Teaneck on December 8, 2011. In 2012, Sokolich and his cousins were given a personal tour of the 9/11 Memorial Plaza by Wildstein, who repeatedly told Sokolich, \\"I've been told to be nice to you.\\" Matt Mowers, regional political director for Christie's re-election campaign, who had previously worked in the governor's intergovernmental affairs office, met with Sokolich regularly in 2013 and told him about other Democrats who endorsed Christie for governor. On at least three occasions, Sokolich noted that Mowers brought up the subject of Sokolich's possible endorsement. Sokolich eventually supported Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in the 2013 election. Christie said at his January 9, 2014, press conference that Sokolich was \\"never on my radar screen\\" and that he would not \\"have been able to pick him [Sokolich] out of a lineup\\". E-mails indicated that Wildstein and Baroni were aware the closures would harm Sokolich. In an e-mail from Wildstein responding to Bill Stepien, Wildstein wrote \\"It will be a tough November for this little Serbian\\", derogatorily referring to Sokolich, who is Croatian-American. Baroni referred to \\"Serbia\\" in text messages in another apparent reference to mayor Sokolich. The May 2015 indictment, citing text messages between Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly, contended that the lane closures were designed to have maximum impact upon motorists and the city of Fort Lee. The closures targeted the first day of school, and deliberately steered cars to the cash lane, so as to maximize traffic disruption in the surrounding areas. The New York Times reported that \\"legal papers show the three plotting like petulant and juvenile pranksters, using government resources, time and personnel to punish a public official whose sole offense was failing to endorse their political patron. The three were in constant contact, brazenly using government e-mails, their tone sometimes almost giddy. They even gave the increasingly desperate mayor of Fort Lee their own version of the silent treatment.\\" Another theory had claimed that the closures were intended to affect Sokolich's promotion of Hudson Lights, a $1 billion redevelopment project that was underway at the Fort Lee bridge access point. It has been noted that \\"the Hudson Lights project is a billion-dollar project because it offers unparalleled access to the George Washington Bridge. But take away that access and it's no longer a billion-dollar project.\\" In a September 12, 2013, e-mail to Bill Baroni, during the time when the closure was still on-going, Mayor Sokolich raised concerns about the redevelopment project, asking \\"What do I do when our billion-dollar development is put on line at the end of next year?\\" Another theory was that the retaliation was for Sokolich's opposition to the PA's recent toll hike. On January 9, 2014, Steven Fulop, Mayor of Jersey City, alleged that he was also targeted for political reprisals by the Christie administration for declining to endorse Christie in the 2013 governor election. His claim may be supported by a September 9, 2013, e-mail by David Wildstein after Bridget Kelly asked about his response to Fort Lee Mayor Sokolich about the toll lane closures. Wildstein responded: \\"Radio silence. His name comes right after Mayor Fulop.\\" Investigations According to The New York Times, the e-mails discussing the lane closure \\"could represent evidence that government resources were used for political purposes, a potential crime\\". According to legal experts, federal prosecutors also could \\"examine whether the obstruction of interstate commerce on the bridge between New Jersey and New York\\" violated federal law, and either federal or state prosecutors also might \\"build a cover-up case, rather than one based on the traffic tie-ups themselves\\". On January 17, 2014, Alan Zegas, Wildstein's attorney, said that his client would offer to shed light on the scandal on the condition that he was given immunity from prosecution from the relevant federal and state law enforcement agencies. There had not been any offer of immunity from the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. A joint legislative committee, New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation, was created on January 27, 2014, to take over the original investigation by the Assembly Transportation Committee. =Assembly Transportation Committee investigation= On October 2, 2013, Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat, said that he would open an investigation with the Assembly Transportation Committee to determine whether or not the lane closures were politically motivated. The first hearing was held on November 25, 2013, for which Bill Baroni attended on behalf of the PA. Baroni, who was not sworn in to testify under oath, said that David Wildstein had ordered a study to determine if closing two of the Fort Lee toll lanes, and assigning them to mainline traffic, would shorten delays for commuters from other parts of New Jersey. Baroni argued that it was unfair that Fort Lee drivers occupied three out of the 12 lanes on the upper level, despite being only 4.5% of all traffic. Committee members pointed out that 4.5% was based on the number of E-ZPass users from Fort Lee that use all approaches to the bridge, and that vehicles from many other towns, besides Fort Lee, use that Fort Lee entrance. He admitted the actual percentage of vehicles, which utilize that Fort Lee entrance, could be higher than 4.5% of overall traffic, and also failed to mention that there are actually 29 operating toll lanes for the bridge when comparing the three dedicated toll lanes for this entrance. Wildstein turned over heavily redacted documents in response to the subpoena. Baroni said that with the reduction in Fort Lee toll lanes, traffic data showed that the mainline traffic travel times in the express lanes' approach to the bridge were about four minutes faster on two days. He apologized for what he acknowledged was the agency's failure to properly communicate with local officials and the public in advance of this project. Following the hearing, Wisniewski called the closures at best \\"clumsy and ham-handed\\" and at worst \\"political mischief by a political appointee and another political appointee that they did not make available for testimony\\", referring to Wildstein's non- attendance. Immediately after Baroni made his presentation, a text exchange occurred, according to subpoenaed documents from Wildstein. Wildstein said \\"you did great\\" and said that the \\"Trenton feedback\\" was good. Sen. Kevin O'Toole released a statement that day to the media, echoing various talking points from Baroni's presentation. All of this suggested that O'Toole had prior communications with Wildstein and possibly Baroni. Wisniewski subpoenaed Foye and career PA staffers to give sworn testimony on December 9, 2013, about the lane closures. The committee had gotten subpoena power only because the PA had been stonewalling the delivery of documents in an unrelated investigation of a controversial toll hike. \\"Had the Port Authority simply complied with the requests, there probably wouldn't have been a rationale for the committee to get subpoena power\\", Wisniewski later said. Robert Durando, George Washington Bridge manager, said that he feared retaliation if he did not follow Wildstein's orders to close two toll lanes to local traffic and not notify local officials or the public about these changes. Durando and Cedrick Fulton, director of tunnels, bridges, and terminals, both said that they were personally told by Wildstein that he would notify Foye of the change. Foye said that he was unaware of any traffic study until he ordered its termination on September 13, 2013, and blamed Wildstein for the toll lane changes, while believing Baroni was involved in the planning. When Wildstein called Fulton on September 6, 2013, to inform him that the lane closures would begin on September 9, Fulton explained that he thought that was unusual since planning for traffic disruptions on major facilities typically starts years in advance. He said that he told Wildstein, \\"This will not end well\\", due to expected traffic problems. Redacted documents were turned over under a subpoena to investigators of the committee and those documents were turned over to The New York Times and other news media. On January 8, 2014, The Star-Ledger, The Record, The New York Times, and other news media published e-mails and text messages tying Bridget Kelly, deputy chief of staff in Christie's office, to the closure. The content of the released communications said that the lane closures were ordered with the knowledge that they would cause a massive traffic jam. Christie released a statement later that day denying knowledge of the scandal, rebuking Kelly for her role in the lane closure event, and vowing that \\"people will be held responsible for their actions\\" in the affair. A Republican member of the Assembly committee complained that the Republican members had not been given sufficient time to review the subpoenaed documents in advance of hearing testimony: \\"Allowing Republican committee members less than 24 hours to review more than 900 pages of information is a disservice to the bipartisan committee process ... As chairman, he [Wisniewski] should be impartial and provide committee members, regardless of their political affiliation, a reasonable opportunity to review documents he has had access to for weeks\\". On January 9, 2014, David Wildstein, who appeared with his attorney, Alan Zegas, refused to testify before the committee, invoking the right against self-incrimination in the federal and New Jersey constitutions. The committee voted to hold Wildstein in contempt, asserting that the right against self-incrimination did not apply in such a hearing. Wisniewski said \\"I do think laws have been broken. Public resources‚Äîthe bridge, police officers‚Äîall were used for a political purpose, for some type of retribution, and that violates the law\\". He called it \\"unbelievable\\" that Christie did not know anything about his aides' plans, stating: \\"It's hard to really accept the governor's statement that he knew nothing until the other morning\\". He also raised the issue of the potential for Christie's impeachment if Christie was aware of his aides' actions. =Special legislative investigative committees= On January 16, 2014, the New Jersey Assembly and Senate each created committees to take over the investigation from the Assembly Transportation Committee. The Assembly committee hired Reid Schar as special counsel, who would assist in the investigation. He is a former assistant U.S. attorney from Illinois who assisted in the prosecution of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. The New Jersey Assembly re-authorized the legislative subpoena powers, which were immediately used to subpoena two organizations and 18 individuals in Christie's administration, the governor's office, his 2013 election campaign, and the Port Authority, but not Christie himself. Those receiving subpoenas were instructed to submit by February 3, 2014, all documents and communications, going back to September 1, 2012, related to the reassignment of the two toll lanes during the week of September 9, 2013, and any attempts to conceal the activities or reasons related to that incident. New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation On January 21, 2014, Assemblyman Wisniewski and State Senate majority leader Loretta Weinberg, whose district includes Fort Lee, announced that the Senate and Assembly committees were being merged into a bi-partisan joint investigative committee of 12 members, and that they would co-chair the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation. While the committee initially focused on the Bridgegate scandal, it had the power to investigate other allegations against the Christie administration. On January 24, 2014, the members of the bi-partisan committee were announced, consisting of eight Assembly representatives (five Democrats and three Republicans), and four Senators (three Democrats and one Republican). At the time, 40% of the members of the New Jersey Legislature were Republican. Besides the two Democratic co- chairs, members included Assemblywoman Marlene Caride (D-Bergen), Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll (R-Morris), Senator Nia Gill (D-Essex), Senator Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex), Assembly Majority Leader Louis Greenwald (D-Camden), Assemblywoman Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth), Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle (D-Bergen), Assemblywoman Holly Schepisi (R-Bergen), Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Mercer), and an unnamed Republican Senator. On January 27, both houses voted unanimously to combine the investigations, maintaining the partisan balance, and announced Senator Kevin O'Toole's (R-Essex) to fill the last spot, despite his mention in a December 5 e-mail from Wildstein to Michael Drewniak. As a precautionary move, the new investigative committee re- issued subpoenas that had been sent earlier, with the requested records still due on the original deadline, February 3. In a January 31, 2014, letter to Reid Schar, general counsel for the legislative committee, Kevin Marino, the attorney for Stepien, said that he would not submit anything in response to their subpoena and requested its withdrawal, citing his client's Fifth Amendment right and New Jersey common law privileges against self- incrimination, with regard to the criminal inquiry underway by the U.S. Attorney, and Fourth Amendment and New Jersey Constitution (Article I, paragraph 7) rights against unreasonable search and seizure. Wisniewski said the subpoena was perfectly sound, and that Schar would review the attorney's objections and consider the committee's legal options. Michael Critchley, the attorney for Kelly, submitted a letter that his client would not comply with the subpoena based on similar claims. On February 3, 2014, Wisniewski and Weinberg issued a statement, without details, that some responses to subpoenas had been received and that extensions for submissions had been granted to others. Mark Sheridan, an attorney for Christie's campaign organization, said it had been granted an extension while it awaited an opinion from the state Election Law Enforcement Commission, which on February 11 allowed the campaign to use existing funds and raise funds to pay its legal bills in response to the NJ Legislature and federal subpoenas for general evidence. It could not use those funds in response to any criminal investigations. On February 10, 2014, the committee voted to reject the objections raised by the lawyers of Stepien and Kelly to not comply with the subpoenas for their records, and to compel Stepien and Kelly to produce all related documents, instructing special counsel Reid Schar to \\"take all necessary steps\\" to enforce the subpoenas. All four Republicans abstained in the vote. They claimed that they did not have enough time to review the legal arguments, including Fifth Amendment rights, presented in Schar's legal brief countering the lawyers' objections. On the same day, the committee announced it was issuing 18 new subpoenas to individuals within the governor's office and the Port Authority that also included new recipients, as well as the governor's office itself and Christie's 2013 re-election campaign. The new recipients included assistants to Foye, Wildstein, Baroni, and Kelly. Other new PA recipients included Christie referral, Philip Kwon, deputy general counsel, Christie appointee William \\"Pat\\" Schuber, a commissioner, who had served in a variety of local, county, and state elected positions in New Jersey, and Steve Coleman, deputy director of media relations. One of the subpoenas was sent to the New Jersey State Police aviation unit for flight information records when Christie used a state helicopter during the toll lane closings. An agency spokesperson said that Christie had not used one to fly over the Fort Lee area during the lane closings. The subpoenas also sought information related to any dossiers compiled by Christie's re-election campaign and his governor's office on Fort Lee Mayor Sokolich. The subpoenas sought information for records from staff at the PA and the governor's office related to preparations for Baroni's presentation to the Assembly Transportation Committee's November 25, 2013, hearing. Wildstein's attorney had claimed that Wildstein was present during some of the times when Kwon, who attended the committee hearing, helped prepare Baroni over several days for his presentation about a traffic study and other issues related to the local toll lane closures. A PA spokesman said: \\"Meeting with a witness prior to testimony is a routine function of any lawyer and any attempt to assign ulterior motives to this general practice is unwarranted.\\" Kwon served as first assistant attorney general during Christie's first term as governor and previously worked for him in the U.S. Attorney General's office in New Jersey. He was also Christie's 2012 Supreme Court justice nominee, who was blocked by Democratic state legislative members. One of the subpoenas sought documents from the PANYNJ related to toll increases for the tunnels and bridges and Christie's 2010 decision to cancel the Access to the Region's Core project, specifically with regard to projected cost overruns. It also requested the names of job candidates sent by Christie's office to the agency. On February 19, 2014, it was reported that the co-chairs said that the committee would need to question Senator O'Toole about what he knew, including any communications with Baroni and/or Wildstein, prior to Baroni's November 25 presentation to the Assembly Transportation Committee. A previously redacted November 25 text message from Wildstein to Baroni said that O'Toole was ready with a statement, which was issued to the media, that echoed talking points from Baroni's same day presentation and attacked the Democrats investigating these issues. O'Toole followed up with an editorial in The Record that elaborated on these talking points and attacks. It raised further questions on whether O'Toole should continue to serve on the committee. On February 28, 2014, Bonnie Watson Coleman withdrew from the committee, a day after she called on Christie to resign as governor due to the culture of bullying she says was fostered under him. On March 21, 2014, Assembly Speaker Vincent Pietro named Assemblyman Paul Moriarty (D-Camden) to fill that vacancy. On March 31, 2014, Wisniewski announced the intention to subpoena notes, records, and interviews from the inquiry conducted for the governor's office by Randy Mastro of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, since they had not been made available to the committee. Wisniewski said that there would be questions about the objectivity and independence of that investigation if subpoenaed items were withheld. In response, Mastro released a statement saying that the governor's office did not release interview transcripts because of its cooperation with the U.S. Attorney's Office's investigation and would respond to any subpoena request, when received. These matters could go to court if the governor's office tried to exercise any rights not to provide subpoenaed items. On April 11, 2014, the committee received the list of 75 persons interviewed by Mastro's team. Wisniewski said that he expected all existing interview materials in \\"whatever form\\", or the committee would issue a subpoena. The interview notes, marked \\"privileged and confidential attorney opinion work product\\", were turned over to the legislative committee and U.S. Attorney's Office, and publicly released online on April 14, without a subpoena. Wisniewski and Weinberg said in a joint statement that the committee reserved the right to request or subpoena further information, if required. On April 9, 2014, the committee's investigation was dealt a setback when New Jersey Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson ruled that Stepien and Kelly do not have to hand over subpoenaed documents since the subpoenas were written too broadly, like a \\"fishing expedition\\". The judge also said that the subpoenas, as written, \\"clearly violate\\" federal and state protections against self- incrimination and unlawful search and seizure. The ruling said that Kelly and Stepien could assert their Fifth Amendment rights because of the investigation by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, and these documents could provide a \\"link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime\\". The judge suggested that the committee could consider reissuing subpoenas with more limited document requests that could be acceptable. Legal experts agreed with that approach, and also suggested that electronic copies of the original subpoenaed documents could be obtained through subpoenas of system servers that store those documents since individuals do not have any personal right to bar the subpoena of a server. The judge also expressed reservations about having jurisdictional powers to compel the turnover of subpoenaed documents since \\"the committee has the power to enforce its own subpoenas through orders to compel and grant immunity in return\\". The lawyers for Stepien and Kelly have contended that the committee could grant their clients immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for the documents. Reid Schar said that the committee had no such powers. Wisniewski forecast that \\"north of ten\\" people would be subpoenaed for testimony. On April 22, 2014, he announced the joint committee's first subpoenas for oral testimony, initially calling four witnesses to testify: Christina Genovese Renna (former director of intergovernmental affairs), William \\"Pat\\" Schuber (a PA commissioner), Patrick Foye, and Michael Drewniak. All four agreed to testify. After a subpoena on April 29 calling Matt Mowers (former campaign staffer who reportedly asked Sokolich for an endorsement, and who has been cooperating with the committee), and some schedule adjustments, testimony was set for May 6 (Renna), May 13 (Drewniak), May 20 (Mowers), and June 3 (Foye and Schuber). However, the committee later postponed Foye's testimony, at the request of the US Attorney. Kevin O'Dowd (chief of staff and nominee for attorney general) was subpoenaed to testify on June 9. The committee was considering issuing a second set of more narrowly focused subpoenas to Bridget Kelly and Bill Stepien. Christie would not be subpoenaed. On May 7, 2014, the committee announced a subpoena for documents and records from Michael DuHaime (Christie's chief political strategist). According to the Gibson Dunn memo on the DuHaime interview, he told Christie \\"on or about\\" December 11, 2013, that Wildstein, Stepien, and Kelly had knowledge of the \\"traffic study\\" beforehand. During Christie's December 13 news conference, he denied involvement by anyone in his office. (start at 6:30 of video) Committee work slowed in July 2014, and they postponed or skipped some witnesses' testimony, in deference to the federal investigation. On July 17, it heard testimony from Regina Egea, Christie's Chief of Staff, who had learned of the lane closures on September 13, 2013, after their reversal and who had later assisted Bill Baroni prepare for his testimony, but she was not accused of wrongdoing. =Port Authority investigation= On October 16, 2013, the Port Authority announced that it would conduct an internal review. Its inspector general opened an investigation on December 10. On February 16, 2014, Executive Director Pat Foye ordered the inspector general and PA Police Chief Louis Koumoutsos to examine PA Police Lieutenant Thomas \\"Chip\\" Michaels for his role in chauffeuring Wildstein on an observation tour on the first day of the closures and allegations of PA Police officers telling frustrated motorists to direct their ire at Mayor Sokolich. Michaels had at least one day's advance knowledge of the closure. Lt. Michaels and his brother Jeffrey Michaels (a GOP lobbyist in Trenton) are childhood friends of Christie. The PA investigation reportedly interviewed only 3 people (Wildstein not among them), and was finished within a few weeks, although PA officials still continued to claim \\"ongoing investigation\\" a month later, when deflecting reporters' questions. =U.S. Attorney investigation= U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman On January 9, 2014, Paul J. Fishman, the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, opened a preliminary federal inquiry into matters related to the toll lane closures. Fishman's office has jurisdiction because the Port Authority was created via an interstate compact between New York and New Jersey. Rebekah Carmichael, public affairs officer for the U.S. attorney's office, said in a statement: \\"The Port Authority Office of Inspector General has referred the matter to us, and our office is reviewing it to determine whether a federal law was implicated.\\" The U.S. Attorney, whose office did not identify who was being served, began an official investigation and issued grand jury subpoenas for documents related to the Bridgegate scandal to various people and entities. Mark Sheridan, a partner with Patton Boggs, which had been retained to represent Christie's 2013 re-election campaign organization and the New Jersey Republican State Committee in connection with investigations into this scandal, said on January 23, 2014, that both organizations had received subpoenas. On February 3, Christie said that his governor's office received a subpoena. The Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted the U.S. Attorney in its investigation. Prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office met with Mayor Sokolich on February 21 and Governor Christie's press secretary, Michael Drewniak, as a \\"fact witness\\", on February 27. Drewniak, who had been subpoenaed by the legislative committee, was referenced in several previously subpoenaed documents released by the committee from others. The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in Manhattan, issued a subpoena to PA Chairman David Samson on March 7, 2014, but then rescinded it on March 10, because of overlap with the Fishman investigation based in New Jersey. As part of the criminal investigation, Drewniak testified on April 4, 2014, in Newark before the grand jury investigating the scandal. His lawyer, Anthony Iacullo, said he was not a target of the investigation. ABC News reported that this was the first confirmation of a convened grand jury, which can meet for up to 18 months (with further extensions possible), for interviewing witnesses. It has the power to indict, subpoena, and interview witnesses without their attorneys being present. The New York Times reported that it was the same grand jury that had reviewed subpoenaed documents. On April 7, 2014, it was reported that David Wildstein met with federal prosecutors in Newark for several days during the week of March 31 and Charlie McKenna met with investigators in mid-January in Fishman's office. On April 25, 2014, it was reported that Fishman had subpoenaed the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation for \\"any and all records\\" they have gathered, with delivery due on May 2. Committee co-chairs Weinberg and Wisniewski said that they will comply, and that the request \\"reaffirms\\" their progress. On May 1, 2014, it was reported that the federal grand jury had subpoenaed PA attorney Phillip Kwon, who had reportedly assisted preparing Bill Baroni's unsworn November 25, 2013, \\"traffic study\\" testimony to the Assembly Transportation Committee, and that Kwon had asked the PA to cover his legal fees. On September 18, 2014, WNBC-TV4 (New York) reported that unnamed federal investigators told them that thus far no evidence that Christie knew in advance of the closures or had directed them was found, but cautioned that the investigation is ongoing and that no final determination has been made. That evening's NBC report by Brian Williams, \\"federal [Bridgegate] charges are now ruled out for Chris Christie\\", was retracted. In January 2015, it was reported that Christie was interviewed by federal prosecutors and FBI agents in December 2014. He reportedly met with investigators voluntarily to give his side of the story. The meeting lasted two hours and was described as \\"professional, collegial and courteous\\". The federal investigation led to Wildstein's guilty plea and the prosecution of Baroni and Kelly. =U.S. Senate inquiry= Senator Jay Rockefeller The United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation had opened its own inquiry into the closure. Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-West Virginia) had written Samson and Vice Chairman Scott Rechler in December 2013 to demand answers about how the Port Authority handled the closure and its aftermath. According to his letter, Rockefeller, who has long been critical about shortcomings in the PA's operations, was concerned about what seemed to be evidence of \\"political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice\\". It also said that based on a review of recent testimony before the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee, it appeared that there was no traffic study underway.Letter from Rockefeller to Port Authority Rockefeller also asked the United States Department of Transportation to conduct its own review of the incident.Letter from Rockefeller to USDOT regarding lane closures The PA's written response to Rockefeller's questions, signed by board secretary Karen Eastman, restated and summarized the December 9, 2013, testimony by Foye and two other PA managers before the Assembly Transportation Committee. It said that the closures had been ordered by Wildstein on September 6, 2013, despite various PA engineers expressing their concerns, particularly about more traffic congestion on local streets and no advance notice to Fort Lee officials. Wildstein, the letter said, had ordered bridge officials not to notify Foye of the closures. It also revealed that the PA's board had not approved Baroni's November 25 presentation before that committee, that the closures were part of a traffic study. It showed that PA's procedures for planning and internal notifications for any traffic study were not followed. However, the letter did not reveal any reason why the closures were ordered. It characterized the incident as \\"aberrational\\".Port Authority's official response to initial Senate inquiry Rockefeller declared that based on the PA's response, there was \\"zero evidence\\" that a \\"legitimate\\" traffic study had been planned. He also said that the letter revealed the PA had not followed its own procedures for lane closures. =Other closure-related probes= The lane-closure scandal also sparked inquiries by the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC and Manhattan DA probes are focusing on the Pulaski Skyway, an elevated highway linking Newark and Jersey City. On June 23, 2014, The New York Times reported that the inquiries are focusing on possible securities law violations caused by Christie's use of Port Authority funds to pay for repairs to the Skyway in 2010 and 2011, using money that was to be used on a new Hudson River rail tunnel that Christie canceled in October 2010.  Trial of Baroni and Kelly =Indictments= On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Attorney unsealed indictments, charging Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly with nine counts of conspiracy, fraud and related charges. These included conspiracy to commit fraud by \\"knowingly converting and intentionally misapplying property of an organization receiving federal benefits\\". That same day, prosecutors released David Wildstein's plea bargain. He had agreed in January to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy against civil rights. Wildstein, whose sentencing was delayed until after the trial, agreed to testify against Baroni and Kelly. The indictments charge that the lane closures were retribution against Sokolich for not endorsing Christie. Fishman said that Wildstein had corroborated the allegations in the indictments, and said that the three officials \\"agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution\\", and that they \\"callously victimized the people of Fort Lee\\". Kelly vigorously denied wrongdoing. Baroni argued that his indictment was improperly based on the unsworn testimony and documents he had provided to the legislative committee in 2014, but prosecutors countered that he had not been offered immunity at that time. The trial for Baroni and Kelly, originally scheduled to begin July 7, 2015, was repeatedly rescheduled, first to November 16, 2015, to allow more time for the defense to review the large volume of documents provided by the prosecutors, then to May 16, 2016, and then to September 12, 2016. Prosecutors asked the court that those documents, about 1.5 million pages, be kept from public view in order to protect the privacy of unindicted co-conspirators, but the defense teams opposed that proposal as overly broad, and preventing collaboration with anyone who could assist but would not be a witness. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Wigenton ruled on July 7 in favor of the prosecutors, writing, \\"The Confidential Discovery Materials shall not be disclosed by defense counsel to anyone other than the defendants and any agent working at the direction of defense counsel in this matter.\\" thereby preventing public access to certain items presented as evidence in the criminal case. Media outlets‚Äîincluding The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Star-Ledger, and The Record‚Äîrequested a hearing with Wigenton to ask that the ban be lifted or modified arguing for the First Amendment right of access to criminal court records. Those news organizations together asked the court to release the prosecution's list of unindicted co-conspirators. On February 17, 2016, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman's office filed a brief to Wigenton requesting that the Bridgegate records remain sealed so that the list of uncharged third-party co- conspirators not be made public. Coconspirators refers to \\"individuals the government believes may have known about the plot to abruptly shut down access lanes to the bridge to cause massive traffic disruptions, but were not charged\\". Fishman claimed that it was a policy of the United States Department of Justice \\"to avoid unnecessary public references to wrongdoing\\" by unindicted co-conspirator because they have no \\"evidentiary value\\" in the criminal matter. If the names were made public, then public employees or appointed officials, who were said to be involved in the lane closures, would not have the \\"opportunity to challenge that information in court\\". Their names would be revealed if they were relevant at a future trial or if the Government \\"moves for the admission of an out-of-court statement made in furtherance of the conspiracy by an unindicted coconspirator\\". On May 10, 2016, Judge Wigenton ruled for the list's release, which she said named individuals \\"whom the government has sufficient evidence to designate as having joined the conspiracy\\". Christie predicted that he would not appear on the list. One of the men on the list filed an emergency motion, as John Doe, and the release was delayed. On September 7, 2016, a federal appellate court ruled that the list, and the identity of John Doe, would remain secret for the time being, but that \\"the time may come, perhaps at trial\\". The media also asked for a separate existing list, which Kelly's attorney characterized as individuals \\"who were not unindicted co-conspirators, but whom the government believed were aware of the alleged criminal conspiracy charged in this case but did not join the conspiracy\\". =Trial and conviction= The jury of seven women and five men, plus four alternates, was seated on September 14, 2016. RNC member and former law partner Bill Palatucci, described as Christie's closest counselor, may be called to testify. In its opening statement on September 19, 2016, the prosecution said that at the World Trade Center site on the third day of the closure, \\"the evidence will show that [Wildstein and Baroni] bragged [to Christie] about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee, and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned\\", and that Wildstein would testify and \\"admit that he was the one who came up with that idea\\". Over the course of a month, prosecutors presented their case. David Wildstein appeared in week two, giving over eight days of testimony. After Wildstein left, prosecutors moved to secondary witnesses. On October 13, 2016, prosecutors concluded their arguments, having spent nearly four weeks laying an argument. The case moves to the defense to make an argument. Over the next two weeks, the jury heard arguments from the defense, with Bridget Anne Kelly on the spotlight, saying it was \\"crude humor\\". Bill Baroni maintained the argument that the traffic jams were part of a legitimate study to determine \\"whether congestion on the main approaches to the toll plaza could be reduced if the lanes earmarked for Fort Lee were eliminated\\". The case on October 26 concluded with the defense resting. On November 4, 2016, after deliberating the testimony of 35 witnesses (including the defendants) and other evidence over the course of five days, the jury found Baroni and Kelly guilty on all counts. =Sentencing= In 2017, Baroni was sentenced to 24 months in prison; Kelly was sentenced to 18 months; Wildstein was sentenced to three years' probation and 500 hours of community service. = Appeals and resentencing= Baroni and Kelly appealed their convictions, and on November 27, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld a majority of the convictions, but overturning the determination that Kelly and Baroni had violated the civil rights of travelers, finding there is no established civil right to interstate travel. The court directed that Kelly and Baroni be resentenced on the remaining seven counts of the indictment. Baroni was resentenced to a reduced prison term of 18 months followed by one year of supervised release.Joe Hernandez, Bill Baroni, former N.J. official convicted in Bridgegate case, gets 18 months in prison, WHYY (February 26, 2019).

Kelly's lawyers filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States, asking the Court to hear their appeal. The court agreed to take up the case, Kelly v. United States, in the 2019 term.Supreme Court to Take Up Bridgegate Case, The Hill, June 28, 2019 Oral argument was held on January 14, 2020. Observers to the Court stated they felt the justices were sympathetic to Baroni and Kelly's side, questioning the broadness of the fraud charges the two were convicted on. On May 7, 2020, the court ruled unanimously to overturn the conviction. The Supreme Court held that Baroni and Kelly for no reason other than political payback reshuffled the lanes on the George Washington Bridge. Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the move jeopardized the residents of Fort Lee but concluded that \\"not every corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime\\".https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/07/politics/supreme-court- bridgegate-new-jersey-opinion/index.html Official misconduct case against Christie Teaneck citizen activist William J. Brennan filed a complaint in September 2016 in the Fort Lee municipal court, alleging official misconduct by Christie. The complaint specifically said that Christie had failed to stop the closure then in progress when, according to Wildstein's sworn testimony, Christie heard about it from Baroni and Wildstein on Wednesday, September 11, 2013, the third day of the closure. The complaint alleged that Fort Lee and its mayor \\"were deprived the benefit and enjoyment of their community as a consequence of this intentional evil minded act\\". In October 2016, Judge Roy F. McGeady, the presiding judge for the municipal courts in Bergen County, accepted jurisdiction based on the events having occurred in Fort Lee, and found that probable cause existed \\"to believe that an event of official misconduct was caused by Governor Christie\\". The judge therefore issued a summons. This put the case into the hands of the Bergen County prosecutor's office. Prosecutor Gurbir Grewal, who was appointed by Christie, recused himself from the case; state attorney general Christopher Porrino, who previously served as governor's office counsel, also recused himself from the case.Claude Brodesser-Akner, Judge says no special prosecutor in Bridgegate complaint against Christie, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (January 16, 2019). Subordinates in their offices therefore handled the matter; the state Superior Court denied Brennan's request to appoint a special prosecutor. In January 2017, a state Superior Court judge denied Christie's motion to dismiss the citizen's complaint, but also vacated the earlier finding of probable cause on the basis that Christie had been improperly denied his right to counsel at the October 2016 hearing; the court ordered a new hearing regarding the complaint. Later that month, prosecutors decided not to pursue charges against Christie. While prosecutors chose not to pursue the case, the Bergen County municipal judge ruled that the case had not been dismissed, and in February 2017, following a new hearing, the Bergen County municipal judge ruled that the case could proceed--saying \\"The court is satisfied that [Christie] had knowledge of the traffic problems in Fort Lee\\"--and issued a new criminal summons. In March 2017, the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office dropped the complaint against Christie, writing to the Superior Court judge that \\"we do not believe that an official misconduct charge can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\\".Prosecutor drops Bridgegate case against Christie ‚Äî Says they can't prove guilt, WKXW (March 2, 2017). Gibson Dunn report On January 16, 2014, the governor's office announced the hiring of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to assist with an internal review and cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's investigation. The firm also agreed to assist \\"with document retention and production in connection with the United States Attorney inquiry, and other appropriate inquires and requests for information\\" and review the governor's office operations and information flow. The lead attorney was Randy Mastro, a long time associate of Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City and former United States Attorney. Mastro served under Giuliani as Deputy Mayor of New York City and Assistant US Attorney. In February, Mastro requested interviews about the toll lane closures with Wildstein and with Sokolich and Kelly, who all declined and were not interviewed. The report, released on March 27, 2014, found that Christie had no advance knowledge of the bridge \\"lane realignment\\", and did not know why it happened. It blamed Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein for orchestrating the toll lane closures. The report revealed that Wildstein said that he informed Christie of the ongoing lane closures during a September 11, 2013, memorial event, but asserted that Christie did not recall that exchange.Dann, Carrie. \\"Internal Probe: Christie's Account of Bridgegate 'Rings True'\\". NBC News. March 27, 2014 It noted that Michael Drewniak said Wildstein appeared \\"anxious\\" during a dinner with him on December 4, 2013, and that Wildstein \\"had mentioned the Fort Lee traffic study to the Governor\\" while the lane closures were taking place. Drewniak said Wildstein told him that the plan to shut the lanes and attribute it to a \\"traffic study\\" were Wildstein's idea, and that Kelly and Bill Stepien had \\"some knowledge\\".Isikoff, Michael. \\"Report: 'Upset' Christie Berates Staff During Tense Investigation\\". NBC News. March 27, 2014 The report also found \\"no evidence\\" that Stepien or Baroni knew of the improper motives for the lane closures, although they were aware that the lanes were to be closed and that traffic patterns were to be changed as a result. After the report was released, Christie said he was shocked by the actions of his former aides and that \\"Sometimes, people do inexplicably stupid things.\\" The report said the lane closures were political retribution against Sokolich but did not identify the specific motive. However, it noted the day before her infamous \\"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\\" message, Kelly confirmed that Sokolich would not endorse Christie. It said she was \\"irate\\" and \\"on fire\\" when a Christie aide met with Sokolich several days later. The report relied on documents provided by the governor's office and interviews with 75 witnesses, including Christie and others from his administration, but no one interviewed had been at the Port Authority at the time of the lane closings. The interviews were not under oath. The report also was based on more than 250,000 documents, many of them e-mails and text messages. Transcripts of the interviews and the names of the interviewees were not released at the time the report was made public. It was estimated that the taxpayer-funded report cost more than $1 million. A separate section of the report rejected allegations by Hoboken's Mayor Dawn Zimmer that Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, director of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, had linked release of Hurricane Sandy relief funds to approval of a project represented by David Samson's law firm. In April 2014, U.S. Internal Revenue Service filings disclosed that Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher donated $10,000 to the Republican Governors Association, of which Christie was then chairman. The contribution was made on March 18, 2014, nine days before release of the Mastro report. The firm donated $55,000 to the association from 2009 to 2012, when Christie was not its leader. It made no donations to the Democratic Governors Association from 2012 to 2014. After Assemblyman Wisniewski gave a deadline of April 11, 2014, for providing the interview records, which were part of the basis of the report, or they would be subpoenaed, Gibson Dunn turned over on that date a list of 75 persons interviewed for the report. On April 14, the interview notes were turned over to the committee and U.S. Attorney's office, and publicly released. Gibson Dunn lawyers said that there were no recordings or verbatim transcripts of the interviews, prompting Wisniewski to characterize the conclusions from these interviews as \\"hearsay\\". There were nearly 370 instances in which the persons interviewed could not recall details about events they were asked to address. The interview notes contained information that was downplayed or omitted from the original Mastro report, showing a governor's office in which government and political operations were deeply connected. They showed how the governor's office worked to secure Democratic endorsements and coordinated with Christie's election campaign to penalize mayors who did not endorse Christie in his re-election. In July 2015, a federal court ruling ordered that materials used to prepare the report be made available to legal defense teams of those indicted. =Reaction to report= Critics attacked the report as a whitewash, which they claimed read more like a legal defense than an objective investigation. They noted investigators could not interview any of the most important figures in the scandal, and contended that Mastro had a conflict of interest since his firm was politically tied to Christie. Wisniewski and Weinberg, co-chairs of the legislature investigative committee, criticized the report as incomplete and potentially biased since it was prepared by lawyers hired by the Christie administration, and the lawyers did not interview key figures in the scandal. Baroni, Kelly, Samson, Stepien, and Wildstein declined to be interviewed. Newspaper editorials noted that one of the lawyers on the investigation team was a close friend of Christie. The report was also criticized for \\"sexism\\" for its treatment of Christie aide Bridget Kelly.Statement from Kelly's lawyer A Monmouth University Polling Institute poll, released on April 2, 2014, found that 52% of New Jersey residents believed the report was conducted to help Christie's reputation. At about that time, a Quinnipiac University poll found that 56% of New Jersey registered voters viewed it as a \\"whitewash\\", while 36% said it was a \\"legitimate investigation\\". In May 2014, a lawyer for Bill Stepien demanded a retraction of the report's contention that Stepien lied to Christie. On December 16, 2015, a United States District Court Judge issued an opinion criticizing the Gibson firm and its investigation for intentionally failing to preserve notes of interviews conducted by attorneys. Judge Susan Davis Wigenton, presiding in the criminal trial of Kelly and Baroni, wrote: \\"The taxpayers of the State of New Jersey paid [Gibson Dunn] millions of dollars to conduct a transparent and thorough investigation. What they got instead was opacity and gamesmanship. They deserve better.\\" Christie's responses On December 2, 2013, Christie said at a press conference that Democrats were just playing politics by holding hearings into lane closures. \\"Just because [Rep.] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [Sen.] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that they really have nothing to do,\\" Christie said. Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved. When reporter Matt Katz asked, \\"Governor, did you have anything to do with these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--\\" Christie dismissively joked \\"I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question.\\" Christie questioned the policy of allowing three dedicated lanes, saying \\"I didn't know Fort Lee got three dedicated lanes until all this stuff happened, and I think we should review that entire policy. Because I don't know why Fort Lee needs three dedicated lanes to tell you the truth\\", and \\"the fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it? That kind of gets me sauced [upset].\\" However, members of the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee said at a November 25, 2013, hearing that the Fort Lee entrance has been used by an even greater number of commuters from the surrounding Bergen County towns. PA officials, including Patrick Foye, confirmed that assessment in their sworn testimony at the committee hearing on December 9, 2013. Christie has denied involvement, saying that his staff acted without his knowledge regarding to the planning for the lane closures. He said at an April 2014 town hall meeting: \\"if anybody told me they were going to do this, I would have stopped it\\". On December 12, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Christie was said to have called New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to complain about Patrick Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority and a Cuomo appointee, in an apparent attempt to shut down Foye's investigation of the lane closures. On December 13, 2013, Christie denied such a call, saying, \\"The story is categorically wrong. I did not have that conversation with Governor Cuomo in any way, shape or form.\\" In his January 9, 2014, press conference, he also denied any such conversation. Heather Haddon of The Wall Street Journal still stood by the report on February 19,(see 7:25 of video. other related discussions with Haddon start at 3:33 and 7:00 of video.) and Matt Katz said that he had independently confirmed it. During the federal trial of Baroni and Kelly, PA Commissioner Scott Rechler (appointed by Cuomo as vice-chairman under Samson) testified that Cuomo had told him that \\"Governor Christie mentioned to [Cuomo] that David Samson was once again complaining about Pat Foye interfering, getting involved in politics.\\" At a press conference on December 13, Christie announced the immediate resignations of Baroni and Wildstein. Nevertheless, Christie said the closure was \\"absolutely, unequivocally not\\" political retribution. Christie added: \\"I've made it very clear to everybody on my senior staff that if anyone had any knowledge about this, they needed to come forward to me and tell me about it. And they've all assured me that they don't.\\" Christie said: \\"The chief of staff and chief counsel assured me they feel comfortable that we have all the information we need to have.\\" At that point during the December 13 press conference, Christina Genovese Renna texted to Pete Sheridan, \\"Are you listening? He [Christie] just flat out lied about senior staff and [Bill] Stepien not being involved\\", and \\"He lied. And if e-mails are found with the subpoena or [campaign] e-mails are uncovered in discovery if it come to that it could be bad.\\" The texts from Renna (an employee of Kelly) to Sheridan (who had worked on the re-election campaign) came to light in court filings by Baroni's attorneys on August 10, 2016, to which Christie responded, \\"I absolutely dispute it. It's ridiculous. It's nothing new.\\" See http://dng.northjersey.com/media_server/tr/2016/08/10court/christie_gwb_text.jpg At the federal trial, Renna walked back her comments, testifying, \\"I had no knowledge of whether the governor was lying or not. But it seemed to contradict what I had been told.\\" In a nearly two-hour press conference on January 9, 2014, Christie apologized for the toll lane closures and said that he was \\"embarrassed and humiliated\\" by the behavior of his staff. Christie claimed he first learned of his staff's involvement via news media reports on January 8. The governor announced that he had fired Bridget Kelly, calling her \\"deceitful\\", claiming her lack of disclosure about her actions and e-mails caused him to mislead the public. Christie admonished his two-time campaign manager Bill Stepien and said he had asked Stepien to withdraw his name from the Republican State Party Chairman race, and to cease his consulting role for the Republican Governors Association. Christie promised that he and his staff would cooperate with any government investigations, including those by the New Jersey Legislature. When asked what he would do if subpoenaed to testify on the matter, Christie said, \\"I'm not going to speculate on that\\". Christie said \\"I have had no contact with David Wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election.\\" Christie was re-elected Governor on November 5, 2013. On September 11, 2013, during the third day of the closures, Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed together at the site of the World Trade Center during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. In the press conference, Christie described his earlier efforts to determine his staff's involvement, saying: \\"I brought my senior staff together I think about four weeks ago tomorrow. And I put to all of them one simple challenge: If there is any information that you know about the decision to close these lanes in Fort Lee, you have one hour to tell either my chief of staff, Kevin O'Dowd, or my chief counsel, Charlie McKenna.\\" The governor's office issued a statement on January 31, 2014, that denied the allegations about Christie that were contained in a January 31 letter from Alan Zegas (Wildstein's attorney) to the PA, which had been made public. The letter questioned the accuracy of various statements made by Christie about his client, without providing any specific references, and claimed that there is evidence of Christie being aware of the toll lane closures at the time that they were closed. The governor's office said that Christie stood by his position that he \\"first learned lanes were closed when it was reported by the press\\". Christie previously said in his December 13 press conference that this was well after the toll lanes for local traffic were reopened. During his monthly talk radio broadcast on February 3, Christie said he was cooperating with subpoenas from the state legislative committee and the U.S. Attorney to his governor's office, which began turning over documents to the legislative committee earlier in the day and would continue to do so as the requested items were located. On April 17, Christie enacted two recommendations of the Mastro report. He eliminated the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, which had been headed by Bridget Kelly. He named Patrick E. Hobbs, dean of Seton Hall University School of Law, Christie's alma mater, as a part- time ombudsman to address complaints about misconduct, enhance ethics training and accountability, and improve electronic communications in the governor's office. Critics noted that Christie's staff and others had used personal e-mails to avoid public scrutiny. Hobbs retained his Seton Hall post. Hobbs asserted that Christie had given him \\"full authority and independence\\" and would leave the job if he felt impeded. The United States Ombudsman Association recommends, however, that ombudsmen be appointed by entities outside of their jurisdiction, preferably by a legislature, to avoid any questions about independence. In 2006, as U.S. Attorney, Christie approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's endowment of an ethics chair at Seton Hall's law school in a controversial prosecution settlement. After a controversy arose over this agreement, Hobbs wrote a letter in 2006 to the editor of The Wall Street Journal praising Christie. Hobbs said he has had a 15-year professional relationship with Christie, and denied the Bristol-Meyers-Squibb arrangement would compromise his role as ombudsman. On April 24, Christie denied creating a \\"culture of divisiveness\\" or that perceptions about his attitude may have led others to plan and allow the lane closures to occur as retaliation. \\"If in fact I created a culture where people were going after each other, then how did we do all these things together with Republicans and Democrats?\\" Christie asked during a Brick, New Jersey town hall meeting. The Star-Ledger editorial board answered that Richard Nixon had cut deals with Democrats, but had still abused power; and that despite Christie's early bipartisanship, he has thrown himself into several partisan standoffs; and that his personal style had always been \\"vindictive and aggressive\\"; and concluded that Christie \\"created the culture that inspired\\" the lane closures. After the May 2015 indictment of Baroni and Kelly and the Wildstein guilty plea, Christie said that the outcome of the federal investigation was a vindication. He said on Twitter \\"Today's charges make clear that what I've said from day one is true\\", and \\"I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act.\\" Political impact New Jersey Democratic political leaders lambasted Christie and the lane closings. Sokolich called them \\"a petty political vendetta\\", while Barbara Buono contended that a culture of intimidation and retribution engendered by Christie and his staff hampered funding of a challenger even though the state was mostly Democratic. The Democratic National Committee released a video in December 2013 that raised questions if \\"Christie's political payback\\" was behind the toll lane closures. It released a satirical video, timed to coincide with the January Assembly hearing, about what questions still needed to be answered. At the beginning of February, it released an online video ad with a Super Bowl 48-inspired, football game theme. It was followed soon after by a video that parodied Facebook's popular \\"Look Back\\" videos. Rudy Giuliani said that if Christie was \\"not telling the truth, he's ruined\\". While Giuliani claimed that he was not acting as a surrogate for Christie, many of the media inquiries for interviews with Giuliani had gone to the governor's office and were forwarded to Giuliani by Maria Comella, Christie's Communications Director. (See table at end of article with list of twenty, and their legal reps, who received subpoenas due Feb 3, 2014, from the legislative committee.) Former Republican New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, a longtime mentor and supporter of Christie, said in January 2014 that he believed Christie when he said he did not know his aides were involved in the lane closures until incriminating e-mails were revealed on January 8. Kean said that there were still unanswered questions about the atmosphere in the governor's office and \\"whether or not there are more than two or three people involved\\". In an April 2014 interview with The New Yorker, Kean questioned whether Christie \\"created an atmosphere in which some of those people thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people\\". Kean said he had reconsidered his support of Christie as a potential presidential candidate, and that if Christie was not telling the truth, \\"then he's finished. As governor, too.\\" Christie was not named in the May 2015 indictment, and the U.S. Attorney, Paul Fishman, refused to speak on the possible culpability of persons other than the three persons charged. According to The New York Times, the indictment would have a negative political impact on Christie's possible presidential ambitions. Iowa GOP donor Gary Kirke said that Christie's delay to announce a possible presidential campaign until after being cleared of wrongdoing, greatly reduced his chances of winning the 2016 Iowa caucuses. GOP operatives said that the scandal itself had not been an issue leading up to Iowa, nor to New Hampshire, where the first presidential primary would be held. =Public opinion=National polls In January 2014, there was a wide range of opinion about the long- term impact of this scandal on a potential Christie 2016 presidential bid for the 2016 election. By early February, national polling showed a substantial erosion in his political standing and 2016 presidential campaign prospects.(Interview with Steve Chaggaris of CBS News) New Jersey polls A Rasmussen poll of New Jersey residents, published January 10, 2014, showed that 56% believe Christie should resign \\"if it is proven that he approved of retaliation against an elected official who refused to support him\\". Only 29% disagreed. A majority believed it was at least somewhat likely that Christie was aware that the September toll lane closures were retaliation for the mayor of Fort Lee's refusal to support his re-election. A Rutgers- Eagleton poll, published January 24, 2014, showed that the Fort Lee scandal had hurt his standings among New Jersey residents. Christie's favorability rating, as governor, was shown to be 46%, down 22 points from just before his landslide re-election victory in November 2013, with 43% having an unfavorable view. While the majority of residents still approved his overall performance as governor, his 53% job approval was down 15 points from November. A majority, 56%, said that it was \\"very unlikely\\" or \\"somewhat unlikely\\" that Christie's top aides acted without his knowledge in the Fort Lee scandal. Only 20% said they fully believed Christie's explanation about this topic, while 42% did not believe his version at all and 33% only partially believed him. A Monmouth University/Asbury Park Press poll, published February 24, 2014, showed Christie's job approval ratings in New Jersey at 50%, which was down 9% since January and 20% from 12 months prior. Other results showed 61% believed the governor was not completely honest about what he knew about the toll lane closures, and 50% (up from 34% in January) thought Christie was personally involved in the decision to close the toll lanes. A similar poll, released on April 2, showed his approval ratings to be about the same, remaining 14 points lower than December, before the Bridgegate scandal broke. It reported that 62% said that Bridgegate and Hoboken's Sandy relief aid issues hurt his presidential prospects for 2016, up from 51% in January. Media coverage The lane closure controversy has received substantial attention from the New York area and national media. The first story in the media about the lane closures, and the first to bring politics into the mix, was reported by The Record's John Cichowski in his Road Warrior column on September 13, 2013, that there was speculation that Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich was targeted \\"either for failing to endorse Governor Christie's election bid or for pushing through a $500 million, 47-story high-rise housing development near the bridge, or for failing to support the Port's last toll hike\\". On September 17, 2013, Ted Mann of The Wall Street Journal wrote a story about what could have possibly prompted the Port Authority to close toll lanes to local traffic without public notifications. Citing anonymous sources, he reported that \\"the decision to close the traffic lanes caused tension\\" since \\"the lane closures came as a surprise to some high-ranking officials at the bi-state agency\\". He said that the toll lanes were reopened to local traffic based on an order from Executive Director Patrick Foye, \\"who argued that the abrupt shift in traffic patterns caused a threat to public safety and should have been advertised to the public ahead of time\\". A subsequent newspaper report by Mann, published on October 1, 2013, was the first to address the contents and quote some of the text from Foye's September 13, 2013, e-mail to PA officials. Foye's e-mail ordered the toll lanes to be reopened, while denouncing the closures as an \\"abusive decision\\" and pledging to investigate \\"how PA process was wrongfully subverted and the public interest damaged\\" without Foye's knowledge. The e-mail said that there were potential violations of state and federal laws. PA insiders disputed that there was a traffic study. All of this reinforced the reported rumors that the toll lanes might have been closed by political surrogates of Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, as an alleged act of political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not endorsing Christie in his 2013 re-election campaign. The Record, The Wall Street Journal, and other news media continued to investigate the matter in comprehensive reporting over the next few months, using sources and requests for public records. The New York Times covered the lane closure story on December 8, 2013. The scandal broke in full on January 8, 2014, with an online story by Shawn Boburg of The Record that Christie's deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly was involved in the planning of the toll lane closures. That revelation catapulted the story into a national political event. The Record continued with details of the dialogues in the troves of e-mails and texts supplied to the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee by David Wildstein. The Record described \\"vindictive lane closures\\" that were intended to cause massive traffic jams in Fort Lee. Related news with quotes from the e-mails and texts were subsequently published the same day in other news media. During his January 9, 2014, press conference about the scandal, Governor Christie cited The Record as breaking the pivotal story on January 8. MSNBC gave substantial coverage to the Bridgegate scandal, and the network's ratings reached their highest point since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings when it covered Chris Christie's apologetic press conference on January 9, 2014. MSNBC's intensive coverage was criticized by Christie, who was formerly close to MSNBC, calling it a \\"partisan network\\" that is \\"almost gleeful in their efforts attacking\\" him. In response to Christie's criticisms of the intensive coverage by MSNBC and other media, Steve Kornacki noted in 2015 that coverage by the media primarily focused on the causes and effects of the bridge toll lane closures and the involvement of members of Christie's administration and his Port Authority appointees, David Wildstein and Bill Baroni, rather than Christie himself. Observing that Christie had ridiculed the media in 2013 for trying to implicate Wildstein and Baroni, Kornacki noted that by 2015, Wildstein had pleaded guilty to federal charges and Baroni was facing a federal indictment in connection with the scandal. In a decision on July 2, 2014, Superior Court Judge P. J. Innes ruled in favor of the North Jersey Media Group, publisher of the newspaper The Record, that the state must partially comply with open records request and turn over some information it had previously refused to release regarding current and former state employees' written requests for the state to appoint them attorneys or pay their legal fees resulting from parallel criminal and legislative investigations into the lane closures, though not the names of the employees. The state must pay the media group's legal fees. The media group plans to appeal, to gain fuller disclosure of the documents.

The lake-filled maar is located along the southern shore of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country, with Alligator Lake protruding out of the shore of the larger lake.

Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Retrieved on 2013-12-31. Tadlac lake is also notable for its history of annual Lake overturns, locally called langal. This phenomenon, rare elsewhere but usually occurring in Tadlac lake during the cold months of December to February, is the result of trapped carbon dioxide (CO2) erupting from the deep layers of the lake towards the surface, leading to fish kills due to low levels of dissolved oxygen.Santos-Borja, Adelina C. (2008). \\"Multi-Stakeholders‚Äô Efforts for the Sustainable Management of Tadlac Lake, The Philippines\\". Research Center for Sustainability and Environment, Shiga University. This phenomenon was greatly heightened by the introduction of aquaculture to the lake in the mid-1980s, eventually leading to a massive and costly fishkill in 1999, which in turn led to the cessation of aquaculture activities on the lake. Prior to the introduction of aquaculture, Alligator Lake was considered as an oligotrophic lake, having low nutrient content and low algal production, resulting in very clear water with high drinking-water quality. Geography and Geology Alligator Lake is located in Barangay Tadlac, in the hot springs resort town of Los Ba√±os ('The Baths' in English) near the border with Calamba City in the province of Laguna. The lake is contained in a piece of land jutting out to the Laguna de Bay that was known as Malilimbas Point, and is directly situated below the northeastern slope of Mount Makiling, the highest mountain in the Laguna Volcanic Field. Because of its origin, the lake has no outlet and is replenished only by rainfall. The slightly oval lake is in surface area with a perimeter of about . It has an average depth of so swimming is not recommended because of its depth and the sudden drop along its shoreline. The lake surface's longest dimension is in the NE-SW direction with the widest dimension perpendicular to the longest at . The crater rim that separates Alligator Lake from the surrounding Laguna de Bay is thinnest northeast of the lake with only about wide piece of land separating it from the larger lake. The Tadlac Barangay Road runs east of the lake but does not circle the lake. Another road runs west of Alligator lake. The lands around the lake are privately owned, and some owners have established resorts around the lake. The Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), as mandated by the government, manages Laguna de Bay and its surrounding areas including Alligator Lake. = Lake overturns = Lake overturns or carbon dioxide (CO2) eruption from deep within, locally called as langal, normally occurs during the months of December to February. During this period some indigenous fishes of the lake are often observed gasping for air near the lake surface. This phenomenon was greatly heightened by the introduction of aquaculture to the lake in the mid-1980s, eventually leading to a massive and costly fishkill in 1999, which in turn led to the cessation of aquaculture activities on the lake. Etymology During the Spanish colonial period, the lake was known as Laguna de los Caimanes (Lake of Alligators or Alligator Lake).Comisi√≥n Ejecutiva del Mapa Geol√≥gico de Espa√±a (1884). \\"Bolet√≠n geol√≥gico y minero, Volume 11\\", pg. 377. Imprenta y Fundici√≥n de Manuel Tello, Madrid.\\"laguna de los caimanes\\". Goodle Translate. Retrieved on 2013-12-30. The great number of crocodilians that used to live in its waters gave the lake its name.Buzeta, Manuel (1851). \\"Diccionario geogr√°fico- estad√≠stico-hist√≥rico de las Islas Filipinas\\", pg. 138. Imprenta de D. Jos√© C. de la Pe√±a, Madrid. Today, alligators or crocodiles have been extirpated in and around Alligator Lake and Laguna de Bay. Suggested etymologies for the name \\"tadlac\\" include a kind of \\"wild ginger\\" and a grass closely related to sugarcane. Documenting field expeditions he conducted during his time with the International Rice Research Institute, Agricultural scientist and journalist Thomas Hargrove noted that \\"Tadlak\\" was the Tagalog term for a kind of wild ginger which he described as \\"pulpy with a red bulb.\\" Alternatively, historian Zeus A. Salazar has suggested that the name tadlac may refer to a local variety sugarcane which he theorized to be common in Laguna and Batangas before the propagation of modern sugarcane, based on linguistic similarities with the local name of Themeda arundinacea in Central Luzon. Economic History=Quarrying= a closer look on the \\"cut\\" left on the northern portion of the crater Starting from 1986, the LLDA authorized the use of or about 12%of its total surface the lake for tilapia fish cage aquaculture to help the local fishermen earn a living. Starting around the same time, the hill on the northern edge of the lake was quarried by its private owner and sold as building materials for home construction. The destruction continued unopposed by the lax management of LLDA, and the local government of Los Ba√±os recognized the activity as the right of the land owner to develop his property. This was back when the Philippine Environmental Impact Assessment System was not yet fully established. In the end, about of earth & rocks were removed and the land was leveled leaving a \\"cut\\" on the crater rim, destroying the natural look of the lake. =Aquaculture= From 1986 until the late 1990s, the lake was heavily used for aquaculture until a massive fishkill occurred in 1999. Through the collaborative efforts of the local leaders and the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), aquaculture was stopped saving the lake from further deterioration. Accessing the lake From Manila, the lake is about or an hour drive from KM Zero in Rizal Park to Barangay Tadlac via South Luzon Expressway then the National Road.\\"Driving Directions - Rizal Park to Alligator Lake\\". Google Maps. Retrieved on 2013-12-31. A park is located on the east side of the lake along Tadlac Barangay Road.

Background  The exact date of birth and parents of Heinrich Kalteisen are not known but he was probably from Koblenz in the Electorate of Trier ( now Germany ). He belonged to the Dominican Order. He studied at the Universities of Vienna and Cologne, where he earned a Magister's degree and a doctorate. Until 1424 he was inquisitor for Mainz, Cambrai and Leuven. From 1430 he held the title of doctor sacrae theologiae professor [ Latin, \\"Professor Doctor of Sacred Theology\\" ] and taught in Mainz. in 1433According to Gierths in NDB. According to Dybdahl in NBL, Kalteisen left in 1432 but, according to Werner in ADB, he was participating since 1431 he participated on behalf of the Archbishop of Mainz, Conrad III of Dhaun, in the Council of Basel, where he became known for his three speeches against the Hussites during a disputation with the Hussite priest Ulrich from the Party of Sirotƒç√≠. Kalteisen was a counselor for Pope Eugene IV on the matters of theology and law. He was a learned man with broad knowledge of theology and canon law as well as of Roman law, philosophy and history.See Bugge, Henrik Kalteisens kopibog for more details. He filled his copy-books with copies of incoming letters and with drafts and copies of outgoing letters, many of which he himself composed and sent. These copy-books are the main reason for his enduring fame. He is also known to have written at least 50 works in Latin and several of his sermons have also been preserved.  The Archbishop  The Cathedral of Nidaros, c. 1830, painting by Mathias F. Dalager. After the death of Archbishop Aslak Bolt in 1450 it came down between the Cathedral Chapter, the King and the Pope in a dispute over the right of succession to the throne of the Archbishop in Nidaros. The Chapter had immediately chosen the canon, Olav Trondsson, as the successor. The King of Denmark and Norway, Christian I of Denmark, protested the election. He wanted his follower Marcellus of Sk√°lholt as the Archbishop. He and the Cathedral Chapter took their dispute to an arbitration court and the court invalidated the election of Olav Trondsson. Under the pressure from the King, the chapter then voted for Marcellus. But the choice was rejected by Pope Nicholas V because Marcellus was considered to be a swindler and adventurer.The assessment is correct. Marcellus was indeed a swindler and adventurer. A renegade Franciscan friar from Nievern ( 5 miles or 7 kilometers southeast of Koblenz ), Marcellus kept getting arrested and escaping from prison all over northern Germany. Rumors of his misdeeds were even heard at the Council of Basel but he managed to make friends and allies in the high places. One of them was Christian I. He remained loyal to Marcellus until 1568, when Pius II was elected as the new Pope, Christian realized that Marcellus had become a political liability. So Marcellus was dropped and a few years later, in 1462, he drowned off the Swedish coast. See Jensen, Denmark and the Crusades, pages 70-73; Lindb√¶k, Pavernes Forhold, pages 13-53; and Willson, Church of Norway, pages 280-285 for more details. Lindb√¶k, the Danish historian, even labelled the first 12 years of Christian I's reign as \\"Marcellus's Time\\" because he believed that Marcellus directed all the policies of the King towards the Catholic Church. On 27 February 1452, the Pope settled the matter with the appointment of Henrik KalteisenDiplomatarium Norvegicum [ Latin, \\"Diplomas of Norway\\" ] ( DN ), Volume I, No. 814. to keep his own man in the Church of Norway. Kalteisen paid for this appointment 800 florins and a few other smaller amounts to the Papal Chamber.DN, Volume XVII, No. 1034. In the summer of 1452 Kalteisen travelled to first Copenhagen and then Bergen. In Copenhagen, he was welcomed by the King. But, as soon as Kalteisen was gone, Christian I declared in his letters that he would not accept him as the Archbishop of Nidaros. Calling him \\"irreligious\\", he considered the rumors of his holiness and education to be exaggerated.Jensen, Denmark and the Crusades, page 72. Meanwhile, in Bergen, Kalteisen spent the winter of 1452 and 1453 administrating his new archbisphoric. Most of his time was spent on numerous legal issues of the church in Norway and the parish business from Iceland, where he was known as Hinrik Kaldaj√°rn in Icelandic. On the morning of Pentecost Sunday, 20 May 1453, he was solemnly consecrated in Nidaros. He was well received by the Cathedral Chapter there but a couple of Norwegian monasteries did not wish to be under his jurisdiction.Hamre, Unionstiden, page 480; Martinsen, \\"Henrik Kalteisen (1450‚Äì1458)\\". As it happened, the new Archbishop lasted for only a few months in Nidaros; he neglected his new home, calling it a \\"barn\\". At that time, a war between Denmark and Sweden was brewing. On his way to Trondheim for the consecration, the Archbishop and his companions were attacked on 25 April 1453 by a Swede, √òrjan Karlson,√òrjan Karlson Skanke of Hov ( c. 1400 ‚Äì 1474 ) was the governor of J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen from 1449 to 1457 and the first knight ever to be born in Jamtland. One of the five sons of Karl Pederson, √òrjan was knighted for his military services in 1449 by King Charles VIII in the Cathedral of Nidaros in Trondheim at the latter's coronation. √òrjan was loyal to his King to the very end. In 1457, he was left in the command of the Tre Kronor [ Swedish, \\"Three Crowns\\" ] Castle in Stockholm by the King, who had fled to Danzig, but the Castle fell in the Midsummer Siege to the Danes and he was captured and tortured. He was released. But in 1463 he was back in jail, with the Archbishop of Uppsala, J√∂ns Bengtsson Oxenstierna, for company, on the charges of conspiracy against King Christian I of Denmark and Norway. The subsequent rebellion by the Archbishop's relatives saved their lives, and √òrjan was out and back in J√§mtland by 1469. He lived out his life in retirement but one source claims that he was killed by the Swedes and buried in Norway. and his troops. The Archbishop and his men were able to fight them off. √òrjan and his men fled afterwards to his native J√§mtland. It is believed that the King of Sweden, Knut Knutsson, was behind this attack.

Therefore, after the consecration, Kalteisen moved to Bergen for safety. Nevertheless, Kalteisen tried to take the initiative with plans to inspect not just the Cathedral Chapter but the whole Archdiocese. His copybooks showed that he invested a lot of effort in familiarizing himself with the circumstances of his Archdiocese. He made a number of decisions in ecclesiastical law but he found the time to write a little history of the diocese of the Faroe Islands. He was also planning to build the new cathedral in Nidaros.  The Opposition  Meanwhile, Marcellus had regained the confidence of the King and accused Kalteisen of incompetence in the office. So Christian I invited Kalteisen to come to Bergen for the arbitration, which turned into a violent altercation with Marcellus. Kalteisen invoked the authority of the Pope, while Marcellus took for the decrees of the Council of Basel and the privileges of the Norwegian Church for his own claim. In the end, the matter was referred to Pope Nicholas V. The King brought to the Riksr√•d of Norway the letter, in which he exaggerated the problems with the establishment of Kalteisen as the Archbishop. He wrote that the Archbishop could not connect with the people and could not speak their language and threatened to close down the Norwegian Church, adding that the Archbishop's accusations against Marcellus were unfounded.DN, Volume III, No. 824. However, it is not certain that the letter to the Pope was actually sent but the King's intentions were clear. In his letter to King Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, Christian I wrote that he was thinking of converting to the Russian Orthodox Church.DN, Volume XVII, No. 1008. He did not convert but, in the end, he was able to turn the Norwegian Riksrad and most of the Cathedral Chapter against the Archbishop. The Cathedral Chapter itself wrote to the Pope that Kalteisen had become so unpopular in Trondheim that he had to be rescued from physical abuse by the King's officers. Only the Rococoportal remains to mark the grave of Archbishop Henrik Kalteisen and the Shrine of St. Olav. But Kalteisen refused to put his position to the mercy of the King. He did agree to go to Rome and ask the Pope but he did not leave immediately. In the winter of 1453 and 1454, he was still in Norway, living in Marstrand (which did not became Swedish until 1658). In the summer of 1454 he went back to Copenhagen, where he had to appear before the Royal Council to account for his administration. He was put under enormous pressure to resign not only his office but also to propose to the Pope that he should return to Norway as the Papal legate and negotiate on his behalf the compensation for Marcellus. So Kalteisen personally went back to Rome and asked the Pope for the permission to resign. He told him that he had not been useful to the Church in Norway. He could not speak the Norwegian language and adapt to the Norwegian ways of everyday life, and his health was also suffering. The Pope refused the request but he sent him as a Kreuzzugsprediger [ German, \\"crusade preacher\\" ] with the rank of Papal legate to Germany to encourage a crusade against the Ottoman Turks.  Resignation and Last Years  In 1456 King Christian complained to the new Pope, Calixtus III that the Archbishop was a weak and sickly foreigner who would not speak the language and that he had refused the royal request to resign. This had led to unrest so great in the country that even Bishop Thorleiv Olafsson was murdered in Bergen.DN, Volume XVII, No. 1041. The murder had nothing to do with Kalteisen. It was the reaction of the Hanseatic League to the Norwegian privateering against the Hanseatic ships. It ceased after 7 June 1458, when the Pope decided to accept the request for the resignation and appointed Olav Trondsson as the new Archbishop of Nidaros. Kalteisen was appointed in June in the same year as the Titular Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia Markus Wesche, \\"Concilium Basileense ‚Äì Konzil von Basel 1431‚Äì1449 [ Concilium Basileense ‚Äì Council of Basel, 1431‚Äì1449 ]\\", (PDF; 1.3 MB ), 2010 Geschichtsquellen des deutschen Mittelalters [ Historical Sources of the German Middle Ages ], page 57. and received a pension of 200 Rhenish florins, to be paid every six months.DN, Volume XVII, No. 629. In 1463 Kalteisen returned to the now destroyed Dominican monasteryToday, all that remains of the Dominican monastery of Koblenz is the Rokokoportal ( \\"Rococo Portal\\" ), which guards the park in the Altstadt ( \\"Old City\\" ) neighborhood. Opened in 1233 on Wei√üergasse ( \\"White Alley\\" ), the oldest Dominican monastery in the Rhineland was closed in 1802 by the order of Napoleon when he and his Grande Arm√©e invaded Koblenz. Its buildings did survive various fires, the Reformation, the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic Wars and World War II but it did not survive the bulldozers in 1955. Only the gate, built in 1754, remains.

He was buried in the monastery church in front of the altar of St. Olav, which he himself had installed.

On the show, she offered advice to new mothers on how to care for their infant children. The show went off the air just three weeks before Crowley died.

His subject matter was sometimes decorative, but he also focused on controversial social and religious issues; on one occasion a sexually explicit scene of Sloan making love to his wife was restricted to his \\"private portfolio.\\" By far his most extraordinary undertaking was the creation of a puppet theatre, where initially he intended to produce \\"original plays\\" for children, such as Rastus Plays Pirate, but by 1928 he transformed the idea into the Marionette Theatre Association for adults. At first he and Ralph Chesse produced classic works by Shakespeare and Eugene O'Neill, but in April 1929 Sloan decided to push the boundaries of censorship and staged Heavenly Discourse by Charles Erskine Scott Wood with anatomically correct nude puppets. In one scene God fondled a naked Eve who sits on his lap. The \\"anarchist Sloan\\" was arrested and the production closed several times, but eventually continued to sold-out audiences. His next production, the West Coast premiere of Sky Girl, portrayed an abstract world run by robots 50 thousand years in the future. He also used his theater to run foreign films that had been banned elsewhere.The Carmelite: 27 February 1929, p. 10; 10 July 1929, p.4; 26 July 1929, p.4; 7 August 1929, p.11.Carmel; Pine Cone: 12 April 1929, p. 9; 17 May 1929, p.7. Beginning in 1924 the Sloans established a second residence south of the Bay Area in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, at that time the largest art colony on the Pacific Coast. Here Blanding was hired by the University of California Extension Division to teach summer classes in etching, theatre design, and painting. He also contributed his prints to exhibitions at the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club and staged puppet performances for the local children. In 1929 his linoleum-cut prints were reproduced in the local literary journal, The Carmelite. That same year he and his wife established Carmel's first international film festival and screened The Light of Asia, the story of Buddha's life with an all-Indian cast, and Hollywood Extra ‚Äì 9413, a \\"very modern\\" psychological drama produced by the abstract Yugoslav painter Slavco Vorkapic.Carmel Pine Cone: 28 June 1929, p.14; 5 July 1929, p.13. By 1931 the Sloans had moved to Los Angeles where there were opportunities to exhibit his prints and work on theatre and puppet productions as well as in Hollywood. In 1938 Blanding was appointed a Regional Theatre Director for the Federal Theatre Project of the WPA, but resigned eighteen months later to become Supervisor of the National Youth Administration for the American Southwest.New York Times, 12 August 1938, p. 11.San Antonio Express, 6 December 1939, p. 11. During World War II he and his prot√©g√©e, Wah Chang, created the East-West Film Company and produced a variety of films, including an interview and performance by the legendary singer Leadbelly as well as The Way of Peace, a controversial film funded by the Lutheran Church depicting the destruction of the world by nuclear weapons.Corsicana Semi-Weekly Light, 10 February 1948, p. 5. The latter may have caused his dismissal from the Disney Studios. By 1948 he was living in Altadena, California, and in the mid-1960s moved to Berkeley, California, and then to the nearby town of Canyon, where he died at the age of 89.

Background  Ma Xisheng was born in 899, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, as the second son of the warlord Ma Yin. At that time, Ma Yin had just taken control of Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan) following the assassination of Ma Yin's predecessor Liu Jianfeng, and was not yet fully in control of Wu'an Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered at Tan Prefecture), which would eventually become the central circuit for the Chu state, but was in the process of gradually consolidating his control. Ma Xisheng's mother Lady Yin, while Ma Yin's favorite, was not Ma Yin's wife ‚Äî as Ma Yin's first son, Ma Xizhen (È¶¨Â∏åÊåØ), was said to be born of his wife, who was not named in historical sources. (Ma Yin would eventually have at least 35 sons, and Consort Yuan bore at least one of those of Ma Xisheng's younger brothers, Ma Xiwang (È¶¨Â∏åÊó∫), although none of the eventual rulers of Chu subsequent to Ma Xisheng ‚Äî Ma Xifan, Ma Xiguang, Ma Xi'e, and Ma Xichong ‚Äî was likely born of her, with Ma Xifan and Ma Xiguang clearly born of a different concubine, Lady Chen.)Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 68.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 69.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 71. Ma Xisheng and Ma Xifan were born on the same day, but Ma Xisheng was born earlier on that day. (Another brother, unnamed in historical sources, was likely born on the same day of a different mother, between Ma Xisheng's and Ma Xifan's births, as Ma Xifan was said to be Ma Yin's fourth son.)  During Ma Yin's reign  Ma Yin, who gradually increased the size of his realm over the years, would eventually receive the title of Prince of Chu (Ê•öÁéã, Chu Wang) as the vassal of Tang's successor state Later Liang; he continued to carry that title as a vassal of Later Liang's successor state Later Tang, and later would be further created the King of Chu (Ê•öÂúãÁéã, Chu Guowang) by Later Tang's second emperor Li Siyuan in 927.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Apparently after being created king and therefore authorized to create a governmental structure of his own mirroring that of the imperial government, he, in 929, Ma Yin made Ma Xisheng, who then carried the titles of deputy military governor of Wu'an and acting mayor of Changsha, a chancellor with the designation Zhi Zhengshi (Áü•Êîø‰∫ã), and also put him in charge of the military affairs of the state (Á∏ΩÈåÑ‰∏≠Â§ñË´∏Ëªç‰∫ã, Zonglu Zhongwai Zhujunshi). It was said that from this point on, all affairs of the state have to first be reported to Ma Xisheng before Ma Yin, making it clear that Ma Xisheng was to be considered his successor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. (Ma Xizhen, both because he was born of a wife and because he was older, would be considered the heir under the traditional rules of succession, but Ma Xisheng was said to be selected because Lady Yuan‚Äîwho was then carrying the regal title of Defei (Âæ∑Â¶É) and who was the only one that traditional histories attributed a consort title to among Ma Yin's concubines‚Äîwas Ma Yin's favorite. Ma Xizhen, apparently to avoid a confrontation with Ma Xisheng, became a Taoist monk and excused himself from the court scene.) Shortly after taking effective control of the Chu administration, Ma Xisheng came to suspect Ma Yin's long-time strategist Gao Yu. Earlier, Gao Jixing, the ruler of Chu's northern neighbor Jingnan, sent a letter to Ma Xisheng, ostensibly to seek permission to allow him to enter into a blood brotherhood with Gao Yu. Ma Xisheng's suspicions were aroused, particularly since his wife Lady Yang's relative Yang Zhaosui (Ê•äÊò≠ÈÅÇ) had ambitions of replacing Gao Yu, and therefore often spoke negatively of Gao to him. Ma Xisheng thus accused Gao of wasteful living and contacting other states, requesting Ma Yin to kill him. Ma Yin refused, but after Ma Xisheng repeatedly requested to at least strip Gao Yu of military command, did so. Gao, displeased, stated to his associates, \\"I am going to build a mansion in the hills to the west, for retirement. The pony [(a double entendre, as Ma means \\"horse\\" in Chinese)] has grown up and can bite now.\\" Ma Xisheng heard the remark and became angry‚Äîso angry that he falsely announced that Gao had committed treason, and he slaughtered Gao and his family, without first informing Ma Yin. When Ma Yin heard this, he cried bitterly, but did not punish Ma Xisheng. In 930, Ma Yin, then very ill, sent an emissary to Li Siyuan's court, asking to be allowed to pass his titles to Ma Xisheng. The Later Tang imperial government, incorrectly, assumed that Ma Yin had already died, and therefore Li Siyuan issued an edict that Ma Xisheng suspend his mourning period (i.e., for Ma Yin's death) and serve as the military governor of Wu'an; the edict also gave Ma Xisheng the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠). It was not, however, until a month later that Ma Yin actually died, and he left a will to his sons, stating that after his death, the further succession of the Chu state should be from brother to brother ‚Äî going as far as leaving his sword displayed at the royal gathering hall and stating, \\"Those who resist my order shall be killed!\\" The Chu generals initially wanted to delay announcements of Ma Yin's death until they had had a chance to fortify the borders, but at the urging of Huang Sun (ÈªÉÊêç) the deputy minister of defense, who pointed out that one ruler was being succeeded by another and that there should not be too much of a display of alarm, went ahead announced Ma Yin's death and Ma Xisheng's succession.  Reign  After Ma Xisheng took over the Chu state, he stated that it was Ma Yin's will that he not claim the title of king (and therefore, not the right to the governmental structure as was given in the regal creation) but only claimed the title of military governor of Wu'an, as a vassal to Later Tang. Li Siyuan subsequently gave him the additional title of military governor of Jingjiang Circuit (ÈùúÊ±ü, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi, which Chu also controlled), as well as the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§). For reasons unclear, Ma Yin was not buried for about a year. During that period, while Ma Xisheng had been authorized by the Later Tang court not to observe a mourning period, traditionally he was considered to be still in that period. Nevertheless, having heard stories about Later Liang's founder Zhu Quanzhong's fondness for chicken, Ma Xisheng also took to eating chicken ‚Äî which, while not absolutely prohibited to him, was considered inappropriate during a time of mourning ‚Äî going as far as killing 50 chickens for food each day. He was also bearing no outward signs of sadness. As Ma Yin was set to be buried in late 931 at Hengyang, Ma Xisheng, who was to escort the funeral train departing Changsha, ate several plates of chicken before departing. His official Pan Qi (ÊΩòËµ∑), seeing this, satirized him by stating, \\"In the past, Ruan Ji ate pork when he was mourning. Every generation will have its wise men.\\" During Ma Xisheng's reign, there was apparently a severe drought in the Chu realm. Believing the gods to be responsible, he, in fall 932, ordered the closure of the temples dedicated to the god of Mount Heng as well as other gods, but the drought continued. He died not long after, and his generals supported Ma Xifan to succeed him.

Dhi is the voiced VƒÅc or 'Speech', it is the thought-mind or intellect. Dhi also means 'to hold' or 'to place', and indicates the activity of the intellect. Overview The natural meaning of Dhi is 'Thought' which corresponds to the Sanskrit word Buddhi which means 'the activity of mind', 'thought', 'understanding' and 'intelligence'. Vedic Sanskrit employs two words Dhi and Brahman for prayerful or meditative contemplation in which context Dhi means 'visionary insight', 'intense thought and reflection', and the word Brahman is derived from the root brh, meaning 'to grow', 'to expand'. Manu Smriti describes ten essential rules for observance of Dharma (the path of righteousness or the 'Law of Being', which binds the people of this world and the whole creation) ‚Äì Dhriti ('patience'), Kshama ('forgiveness'), Dama ('self-control'), Asteya ('honesty'), Shauch ('purity'), Indriya-nigrah ('control of senses'), Dhi ('reasoning'), Vidya ('knowledge and learning'), Satya ('truthfulness') and Akrodha ('control of anger'). Application Dhi, the prefix of Dhimahi and Dhiyo occurring in the Gayatri Mantra (Rig VedaIII.62.10) refers to 'understanding', and its cognate word Buddhi means 'reasoning faculty of the mind', which understanding must be transcended to experience the Ultimate Reality. The word, Dhira, meaning 'calm', denotes the seeker whose intellect is saturated in knowledge which word is the combination of Dhi meaning 'intellect' and ra meaning 'fire' or 'wisdom'. The Non-Atman i.e. the Anatman, which is by its nature disagreeable, is the object of the function of Dhi (=buddhi) which reveals the joy (ananda), the nature of the individual consciousness. Patanjali defines Yoga as neutralization of the alternating waves in consciousness; in the phrase citta vritti nirodha (Yoga Sutra I.2), Citta refers to the 'thinking principle' and includes 'pranic life forces', to Manas ('mind' or 'sense consciousness'), Ahamkara ('egoity') and Buddhi ('intuitive intelligence'), and Vritti refers to the waves of thought and emotion that ceaselessly arise and Nirodha refers to 'neutralization', 'cessation' or 'control'. The root budh and its derivatives appear in the Vedas in the sense of 'kindling' or 'awakening', the word buddhi appears for the first time in Samkhyayana Brahmana Upanishad. Dhi is derived from dhriti and its cognate didhiti, it also refers to flash of intuition which is beyond all purely sensuous perception. The mental organs are manas ('mind') and hrd ('heart'), and the mental faculties are citta ('thought'), dhi ('mental vision') and kratu ('mental power'). Manas is said to perform the processes indicated by the verbal roots 'cit-, dhi- and man-; dhi requires kratu in actualizing visions. Connection with VƒÅc Dhi refers to 'vision' or 'inspiration which is the exceptional faculty of acquiring a sudden knowledge of transcendent truth or reality', 'the inner light of visionary insight'. Soma is the Lord of Vision who dispenses inspiration and Speech (VƒÅc) is inspired thought (manisa) or wisdom guarded by the seers on the seat of Rta. The Rig Veda links language not only to thought (manas) but also to vision (dhi), a word from which comes Dhyana meaning 'meditation'. In the Yajurveda (29.8), Sarasvati, the Goddess of Speech, is invoked to grant the gift of Dhi, inspired thought, and thought is linked with VƒÅc; Sarasvati is also known as the river of inspired thought, The Vedas are the sacred texts of the Hindus. They are the repository of what is the known or required to be known, in other words, the true knowledge or the transcendent eternal wisdom articulated in Sound ('sabda') or Speech ('vƒÅc'). The Vedic seers have associated the power of speech or the spoken word with ultimacy and transcendence ‚Äì ekam sat (Rig Veda I.164.46). They also know Vishwakarma, the creator, as VƒÅcaspati, the Lord of Speech (Rig Veda X.81.7) (who is also called Brihaspati and Brahmanaspati), and that VƒÅc or speech or utterance as Brahman is the creative principle and the absolute force in the universe; the person who has gained its knowledge is said to have attained the highest knowledge (Rig Veda X.125.5). As far as Brahman extends so far does VƒÅc (Rig Veda X.114.8). Role of VƒÅc The Inspired thought (dhi) that precedes utterance though connected with speech undergoes some modifications while being transformed into speech; the Vedic Rishis tell us that the thoughtful one's produce speech with their mind (Rig Veda X.71.2), the different stages in transformation from dhi to vƒÅc are described in the Atharvaveda (VII.1.1). Dhi is the voiced speech. Goddess Saraswati presides over speech but vƒÅc extends far above and beyond Saraswati (Rig Veda X.125) beyond all known spheres (Rig Veda X.114.8). VƒÅc is dependent on breath or air; and the Aitareya Brahmana (IV.42.1) states Brahman vai vƒÅk, VƒÅc is the mother of the Vedas and the Vedas themselves (Shatapatha Brahmana (6.5.3.4). The Vedas are a form of the ritual and cosmological VƒÅc (speech). VƒÅc is presented as consort of Prajapati (Kathaka Samhita 12.5.27.1) whom the Brahmanas express as 'the expressed' (nirukta) and as the 'unexpressed' (anirukta), the limited and the unlimited. Taittiriya Aranyaka tells us that VƒÅc is the imperishable one, the (Aksara), the first-born of the cosmic order (Rta), the mother of the Vedas (vedanam mata), the navel of immortality (Amrita) and therefore Vedas themselves are infinite (Ananta), immortal (amrta) and imperishable (akshita). The Jaiminiya Upanishad tells us that Aum or Om, the essence of all essences, is VƒÅc. On the human plane the mind precedes speech, and on the cosmic plane Prajapati precedes vƒÅc as the Lord of Thought and Speech, who brings forth vƒÅc to unite with vƒÅc to manifest creation. VƒÅc was probably the language commonly spoken by the Vedic people as the language of men. VƒÅc is another name for Aditi or Viraj. For the purpose of invoking Agni and other devatas, the mantras of the Rig Veda have a very essential role to play because the Upasaka when meditating is required to think of the Rcs as VƒÅc i.e. speech; it is for this reason that the mantras are chanted and there is a prescribed way to do that chanting. Rishi Medhatithi Kanva (Rig Veda I.12.11) prays: :‡§∏ ‡§®‡§É ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ü ‡§≠‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§® ‡§®‡§µ‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§∏‡§æ  :‡§∞‡§Ø‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡§µ‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Æ‡•ç  \\"May Agni accept the words of praise (adoration) set in newer hymns composed in Gayatri metre and devoutly sung (chanted), (May Agni) accept the oblations made in it (in the prescribed manner) of the offerings rightly earned and belonging to the performers of rites.\\" And, Rishi Ayasya (Rig Veda IX.46.2) praying thus- :‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§µ‡•ã ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§∑‡•á‡§µ ‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä  :‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•É‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§§  informs us that having acquired the knowledge of the highest the learned people (easily) unravel the deeply hidden meaning of the most subtle kind. This means, that each experience of ours is a re-discovery of ourselves, and that in order to really re-discover ourselves so as to understand our true nature we have to firstly awaken our mind, then make the mind speak loudly enough to be heard because Prana, which is the body of the mind, is that very silence waiting to be heard. A sage of the Rig Veda (Rig Veda X.20.9) states that the creator vested Agni with three coloured flames and made it brilliant, eminent, swift-acting and hot. The sage of the Chandogya Upanishad tells us that behind all things are these three colours, the rest constituted out of them are a modification and a name. Speech is Rk or Brhati identified with Prana whose lord is Brihaspati, the same lord is Brahmanaspati when speech is Yajus associated with Brahman. Speech is Sama; it cannot reveal itself for it is as formless as the air on which it rides; it rides upon the streams of air constituting the wind, and words once uttered do not return to the speaker. Yajnavalkya tells King Janaka that the light that comes nearest to the supreme light of the Atman is the light of VƒÅc i.e. speech, since it is the supreme faculty of reason that finally lifts the consciousness towards the pure self-shining awareness of the Atman, and which after serving as a pointer vanishes or goes to rest. The Vedic sages have all along advocated 'Truth', 'Penance' and 'Study' as special virtues. Amongst these three special virtues Truth is held out to be the supreme virtue to be practised by all aspirants. All primary virtues are firstly imbibed from the parents; Satyakama Jabala acquired the spirit of truthfulness from his mother, and Sanat Kumara taught Narada that Truth has to be sought for realization ‚Äì \\"when one indeed understands Truth in its reality one speaks the truth\\". While describing the rituals associated with the Ashvamedha yajna, in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad we are told that the neighing of the horse, representing the cosmos, is VƒÅc. Claim for primacy A sage of the Chandogya Upanishad after declaring that the syllable Aum, having the individual and also the cosmic efficacy, not only serves to help the meditation of the individual person but even the Sun travels the universe singing Aum as does Prana moving in the body (Ch.Up.I.5.1,3) explains that that Aum is the essence of all beings on this earth, the essence of a person is speech and the essence of speech is the Rig Veda (Ch.Up.I.1.2) but the essence of Samaveda, which is the essence of the Rig Veda, is Udgitha which is Aum. He declares that all speech is interwoven on the symbol Aum, in the same manner as the leaves of a tree are woven together on a stalk (Ch.Up.II.23.3). Speech is the fuel of fire which is man (Ch.Up.V.7.1). Mind consists of 'food', the Prana consists of 'water' and speech consists of 'fire' (Ch.Up.VI.6.5). Narada is told by Sanat Kumara that all this is but a name by which one knows, even then speech is greater than name because if there is no speech neither righteousness nor unrighteousness would be known, but surely the mind is greater than speech for mind is the entire world (Ch.Up.VII.2 & 3) establishing the claim of the mind (dhi) for primacy over speech (vƒÅc).

OpenGov serves over 1,000 cities, counties, and state agencies across 48 states with the mission of powering more effective and accountable government. In April 2020, OpenGov released a full-cloud ERP system designed specifically for municipal and county governments. https://opengov.com/about/ History OpenGov was founded in 2012 by Zachary Bookman, Nate Levine, Dakin Sloss, and Joe Lonsdale. The company's founders and several advisors met while working with California Common Sense, a non-profit non-partisan organization, which advocates for open data and open government principles. After observing the public sector's struggle to combat the ongoing budget crisis with outdated software systems, the group founded OpenGov with the long-term goal of bringing a modern cloud ERP to local and state governments. In April 2016, OpenGov acquired Ontodia, a leading developer of Open data CKAN, allowing OpenGov to build out its offerings with a managed open data CKAN and dashboards to OpenGov's Reporting & Transparency suite. In October 2017, OpenGov acquired government-serving tech company, Peak Democracy of Berkeley, Calif, to expand its public engagement, communication, and feedback tools. In September 2019, OpenGov acquired ViewPoint Cloud, a platform used by city and state governments to manage community development operations, such as permitting, licensing, inspections, and code enforcement.. In April 2020, OpenGov launched the first fully-integrated cloud ERP designed specifically for local government, which includes a platform of core modules for Budgeting & Planning, Financial Management, Community Development, and Reporting & Transparency.https://www.govtech.com/biz/OpenGov-Completes-Cloud-ERP-Suite- with-Accounting-Software.html Customers As of April 2020, OpenGov serves 1,000 government entities (including state agencies, city governments, school districts, and other special districts). = Municipalities = The City of Palo Alto was OpenGov's first customer, following a collaboration between the city and employees from nonprofit California Common Sense to launch a comprehensive open data platform.

Wilcox and starring Ralph Meeker and Nancy Davis. Plot Lou and Betty Hopke, who own a gas station in California, feel that they owe help to Burt, an ex-Marine who has been confined to a veteran's hospital since the war. Lou is indebted for Burt's having saved his life in combat, and Burt is also Betty's brother. Whenever it rains, Burt is stricken with terrible memories and panic attacks. Although they want to let Burt live in their home, Lou and Betty worry about his volatile behavior around their two young children. Stella Murphy has met Burt at a hospital dance and urges him to find a home of his own. She wants him to move to Oregon with her and work on her grandfather's farm, but that region's rainy climate discourages him. Burt decides to invest in the Hopkes' gas station, causing an angry Stella to leave him. Burt uses his savings to buy a small boat, which he fixes up. Lou and Betty's young son Chris keeps pleading with Burt to take him sailing. The boy stows away when Burt launches the boat, but Burt sends him safely home. Later, the boy sneaks out of his bedroom at the family's home and returns to Burt's boat, docked at a marina. It is dark and it is raining, and Burt is asleep inside the small boat, traumatized by the rain.

Firth attracted attention when, in 2013, she was booked as the first black model in nearly 20 years to appear in a Prada advertising campaign. Early life Firth was born in Mombasa, Kenya and brought up in Barking, a suburban town in east London, when she was seven years old. Her family in Kenya belongs to the ethnic group of the Giriama. Her father, Eric, is of British, Seychellois and Ugandan descent, and mother, Jecinta, is half-Kenyan and half-Swiss. Malaika was born in Kenya and lived there until she was seven, when the family moved to Barking, east London. Eric worked as a French polisher at the Four Seasons hotel. When Malaika talks about her family you get a glimpse of her ambition, but also of a rootedness that might save her from her industry‚Äôs worst excesses. She says, \\"I don‚Äôt come from a posh or high-class background. We lived in flats in the ghetto, our version of 'the Bronx'. We weren‚Äôt poor, but there wasn't a lot of money. I shared a room with my sister and my auntie. I struggled getting by in school, with ¬£2 for my lunch. When the EMA (Education Maintenance Allowance) came out I was so excited ‚Äì ¬£20 a month! I appreciate everything that has happened. For me to have this career is life-changing for my family\\". Home is Kenya or New York ‚Äì maybe Los Angeles, one day. \\"Everywhere is home. I am like a gypsy!\\" she says. She has not been back to Barking since she \\"blew up\\" ‚Äì the family has all moved to Kenya, so there are no ties to east London left. \\"I only had one or two friends in sixth form anyway. I was bullied a lot at school. People were like ‚Äì \\"she‚Äôs so shy, she‚Äôs so boring, I don‚Äôt want to talk to her. But ‚Äì ha! ‚Äì now look where I am. I see people's comments on Instagram, talking about how well I am doing. When I think about stuff like that I just think: \\"Thank you, God\\". Career Firth was encouraged by her mother to try out modeling, after watching an episode of \\"The Model Agency\\", which featured a documentary about the Premier Model Management. Her mother called up the agency and arranged a meeting with them. After attending an open-call casting, Firth was signed on the spot. Beginning her modeling career at age 17, Firth soon began modeling internationally: She gave her runway-debut at the New York Fashion Week SS2012 for Odilon. She gained attention from the fashion industry after walking in the SS2014 Prada menswear show and starring in the Prada-fall 2013 campaign, which also featured Christy Turlington, Catherine McNeil, Cameron Russell, Freja Beha Erichsen, Fei Fei Sun and Rachel Williams and was shot by Steven Meisel. With this feat, she became the first Black model in 19 years to score a Prada campaign. The last Black model to book a Prada campaign was Naomi Campbell for the fall 1994 campaign. Meanwhile, Firth experienced her runway-breakthrough with the fashion week for the Spring/Summer 2014 collections, walking more than 40 shows, including shows from Jean Paul Gaultier, Bottega Veneta, Marc Jacobs, Kenzo, Dolce & Gabbana among others. In November 2013, she debuted at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. For the Spring/Summer 2014 campaign season, Firth booked campaigns from Valentino, Burberry and Prada for the second-consecutive time. Personal life Firth is currently based in London. If it was not for modeling, Firth would have tried out acting. She acted in several amateur productions in Barking local theatre. Her grandmother runs a restaurant in Kenya.

Next, they perform Descensum - travelling to hell and back, a sun-up deadline for their return. Queenie, Madison, and Zoe return but Misty disintegrates to ash, unable to meet the deadline.

Zoe ends up teleporting on a pike over the Academy's gateway and dies, while Queenie fails to revive her, removing the latter in the running for Supreme.

It is a small, erect, openly branched shrub with egg-shaped to elliptic leaves, and purple to mauve flowers arranged in leaf axils. Description Prostanthera marifolia is an erect, openly branched shrub that typically grows to a height of with hairy branches. The leaves are egg-shaped to elliptic, sometimes appearing slightly triangular when the edges are strongly curved downwards, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils with bracteoles long at the base. The sepals are long forming a tube long with two lobes, the upper lobe long. The petals are purple to mauve and long. Flowering probably occurs throughout the year and the fruit is long. Taxonomy Prostanthera marifolia was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, based on plant material collected on the north shore of Port Jackson. Distribution and habitat Seaforth mintbush is only known from the northern Sydney suburb of Seaforth where it grows on ridge-tops with Eucalyptus sieberi and Corymbia gummifera in or near the endangered Duffys Forest ecological community. Conservation status This mintbush was thought to be extinct, not having been collected since 1810, but was rediscovered in 2001 and subsequently classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.

In 1996 along with number of other parties, it merged into the People's Democratic Party. With the beginning of perestroika (movement for transformation) in the USSR and process of glasnost (transparency), democratization of society, discontent is created in the ranks of the Communist Party as an opposition to its conservative party's top. That wing of the Communist Party was the basis of \\"the Communist Party Democratic Platform\\" (Demplatform). Eventually it turned out that all the hopes of improving the situation in the Communist Party are useless therefore most of the Demplatform in the Communist Party of Ukraine decided to create its party that would be \\"not a communist and not anti-communist\\". Twenty seven members of the Supreme Council of Ukraine signed a joint declaration of secession from CPSU, and particularly the future leaders of PDVU - Volodymyr Hrynyov, Volodymyr Filenko, Oleksandr Yemets. Former leaders of \\"Demplatform\\" became the basis for the formation of the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine. They often were accused of being \\"repainted\\" communists. But those people, like Myroslav Popovych already were struggling with the party apparatus from the beginning perestroika process. Those were people with certain experience, intellectual baggage. In addition, to the new party came unaffiliated, some anarchists and some former members and SDPU and OSDPU. For example, in Luhansk among members of the party, according to data presented at a congress, there was less than 20% of former communists (in the constituent congress, held in Kiev on December 1‚Äì2, 1990, in PDVU there were 2.3 thousands members). Immediately within the party were formed two factions: Social Democratic and Liberal Democratic. But the organizational committee decided that at this difficult time democrats should not disperse their forces. Both factions set out to transform Ukraine into a \\"democratic independent state with an effective market economy and social protection of citizens\\" defended \\"priority of human rights over the rights of any social and national community and the priority of people rights over the rights of the state\\". Uniqueness of PDVU lay in the fact that it even before its Constituent Congress had its parliamentary factions: among the Constituent Congress delegates there were 18 members of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Almost one in five of the 324 deputies of the Congress was a member of this or that level. Co-chairmen of the Coordinating Council were elected M.Popovych (one of the founders of the Rukh), V.Hrynyov (Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine), O.Yemets (Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights), K.Filenko (Deputy Speaker of the National Council), V.Khmelko (vice president of the Sociological Association of Ukraine), S.Lylyk (Lviv historian) and O.Bazylyuk (professor of Donetsk). This structure, which had to meet all current party carried the negative . In particular, different approaches to a number of problems, such as a national issue. V. Hriniov, who considered himself a liberal- bourgeois politician, argued that \\"the role of the mother, we did not perform a geographical place, and administrative- command system... The chance to fight it we get only when it does not oppose the national and wider democratic idea \\"because\\" administrative system ... sufficiently adapted to the national liberation movement and starts to use it to their interests\\". This is especially manifested August 24, 1991, when V. Hriniov his associates refused to support the Act of Independence of Ukraine to ban the Communist Party. \\"If we put overeignty as an end in itself, it can get totalitarian state - argued founder PDVU V. Hriniov in January. - It is necessary that the system is burned to ashes \\" 2). The biggest event of the end of the 1991-1992 biennium for PDVU was the foundation, the \\"New Ukraine\\", and initiated the foundation of which was PDVU. At the end of 1992 in Kiev hosted the conference of social and political organization \\"New Ukraine\\". The main goal of creating a \\"University\\" was a combination of political influence of party leaders and financial capital businesses. The parties entered into the merger OSDPU the Social Democrats, LSPU, KDP, some of the ROM. Among the business organizations - the Confederation of Ukraine, the Ukrainian League of enterprises with foreign capital and Ukrbank et al. \\"New Ukraine\\" defined by its main goal to promote Ukraine market reforms. Reform projects to that time was already prepared by the then Deputy Prime Minister V. Lanovyi. \\"N.U.\\" established in the Parliament of his faction which came and Kuchma. But to implement the program V. Lanovyi failed. Scared of radicalism, Vitold Fokin \\"removed\\" V. Lanovyi of government. In these circumstances, and I passed Congress \\"New Ukraine\\" in June 1992. Apparent heterogeneity of the whole \\"New Ukraine\\" : some showed themselves Social Democrats, others - as liberals, some - as advocates of full independence of Ukraine, while others wanted to draw her again in neo-imperial structure - whether in the form of CIS, whether various \\"There is one space\\". The tension between them nearly led to a split in the Congress I, which won the \\"Independents\\" and liberals. \\"Grand statesmen\\" that would have its nationwide organization, had to be content with the establishment in Donbas State Congress. These events have shown that the primary intent of the \\"New Ukraine\\" - to focus on the economy, abstracting from politics - could not be made. Kuchma, becoming prime minister, came out of parliamentary faction \\"New Ukraine\\". His government did not accept V. Lanovyi program, supported by the majority Novoukrainka 3). In the I Congress of the \\"New Ukraine\\" was chosen chairman Filenko. Within six months after the Congress in the \\"New Ukraine\\" sharp disagreement between the \\"Independents\\" and \\"Grand statesmen\\". The leader of the \\"New Ukraine\\" Filenko union tried to turn on the mobile and efficient batch socially liberal (for electoral success), but because of the many obstacles tsomu failed. This situation has caused the convocation of the Congress II \\"New Ukraine\\" held March 13‚Äì14 in Kiev. Combining needed reorganization. Save sole leader without the threat of schism and without transformation into a political party was impossible. Therefore, the \\"New Ukraine\\" became the coalition parties and other public associations, and regional organizations. Its central authorities are not elected by the Congress and formed by the delegation of representatives of the member organizations of the coalition. Each of the regional organizations, institutions, corporate members create their own parliament. The biggest controversy started around the election of governing bodies. V. Hriniov been chosen, which indicated the rise of \\"velykoderzhavnykiv .\\" After that, many observers predicted transition \\"New Ukraine \\" to pro- position and possible split in the union and in the PDVU . Immediately after the Congress of \\" N.U .\\" in Ukrainian Student Union, who said that the election of V. Hriniov dissatisfied with the President of the Association and who \\" puts the Ukrainian national interests in the foundation of their activity ,\\" 4). Summer of 1993 V. Hriniov resigned as Vice-Chairman, disagreeing with government policy. Speaking on this occasion, V. Hriniov taken explicitly anti-Ukrainian stance is very struck by the authority of the \\"New Ukraine \\", and in particular PDVU . The process of leaving people with \\" New Ukraine \\" and PDVU. For example, urban organization PDVU Svitlovodsk announced the suspension of its activities. Most former members PDVU transferred to the PSA. In July 1993 at the meeting of Poltava great council \\" New Ukraine \\", where V. Hriniov proposed the creation of a strong and effective union party \\"New Ukraine \\", practically repeating and supporting Filenko opinion, which he expressed in IV C ' PDVU ride . PDVU fully supported this proposal, and SDPU inclined to certain amendments. LSPU and KDP made an attempt to gather all the opposition forces in a big party fist. Coming in the \\" single fist \\" Novoukrainka failed, V. Hriniov created together with Kuchma Interregional priority area (ICBM ). In the elections of 1994 and BP PDVU deputies had 4 members. While the post- election crisis in, PDVU and \\"New Ukraine \\" looking out of this situation because many observers predicted the decline of both organizations, especially after the departure of ICBMs. January 28, 1995 at a joint meeting of the governing bodies of the Labour Congress of Ukraine and the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine was established political power TKU - PDVU. At the end of June in Kiev the IV Congress of the \\"New Ukraine \\", where the main role played by power - TKU PDVU. The congress took place correction program association. Congress showed that the association supports the decentralized unitary state and a bicameral parliament. Was solved and the language problem. Association recognizes the Ukrainian language, the status of international language and medium of official public communication. Combining emphasizing their involvement in the President, took the position very loyal to the executive. By the IV Congress of the \\"New Ukraine \\" from the union withdrew almost all small parties, leaving only the Liberal Democrats. The congress was held on LSPU even scandal, because traditionally the governing bodies of the \\"New Ukraine \\" elected party leaders, members of the association . But during the election Filenko protested against the election V.Klymchuka leader LSPU to governing bodies. At the head of the Association elected a prominent politician, mayor of Kharkiv, Yevhen Kushnaryov. Was elected Vice- Anatoliy Matviyenko and Filenko. Congress also noted that the union stands for the Social Liberal democracies 5). Governing bodies are divided into full PDVU (meetings, conferences, conventions) and functional (all other governing bodies). At the highest level governing bodies are PDVU Coordinating Council (RC) and the Arbitration and audit committee, as well as scientific and editorial and publishing board. Organizes work parties KR, Presidium Secretariat. Chairman of the Presidium is also chairman of the CD.

Current Research and Operating Mechanisms Comparison of turbulent flow structures over an airfoil when a pulsed linear (left) and a serpentine (right) plasma actuator are used to control the flow. Serpentine plasma actuators (like other Dielectric Barrier Discharge actuators, i.e. plasma actuators) are able to induce an atmospheric plasma and introduce an electrohydrodynamic body force to a fluid. This body force can be used to implement flow control, and there are a range of potential applications, including drag reduction for aircraft and flow stabilization in combustion chambers.Wang, Chin-Cheng, and Subrata Roy. \\"Combustion stabilization using serpentine plasma actuators.\\" Applied Physics Letters 99.4 (2011): 041502-041502. Flow visualization comparison between flow structures generated by linear (top) and serpentine (bottom) geometry plasma actuators The important distinction between serpentine plasma actuators and more tradition geometries is that the geometry of the electrodes has been modified in order to periodic across its span. As the electrode has been made periodic, the resulting plasma and body force are also spanwise periodic. With this spanwise periodicity, three-dimensional flow effects can be induced in the flow, which cannot be done with more traditional plasma actuator geometries. It is thought that the introduction of three-dimensional flow effects allow for the plasma actuators to apply much greater levels of control authority as they allow for the plasma actuators to project onto a greater range of physical mechanisms (such as boundary layer streaksButler, Kathryn M., and Brian F. Farrell. \\"Three‚Äêdimensional optimal perturbations in viscous shear flow.\\" Physics of Fluids A: Fluid Dynamics 4 (1992): 1637. or secondary instabilities of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave).

A collection of loyal covers of songs performed or popularized by the trio of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. collectively known as the Rat Pack, Please Return the Evening was the first Daddies album not to feature original music by lead singer- songwriter Steve Perry, and the first in a trilogy of cover albums designed to showcase the Daddies' swing and jazz influences, subsequently followed by The Boop-A-Doo in 2016. Overview Please Return the Evening consists entirely of cover versions of songs performed and popularized by the \\"Rat Pack\\" of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr.. In stark contrast to the Daddies' previous studio albums, the album features no original material by Daddies frontman Steve Perry while also focusing exclusively on traditional swing and jazz music, without any of the ska, rockabilly or rock influences which typically make up much of the band's sound. In interviews detailing the project, Perry described Please Return the Evening as \\"a total labor of love\\", explaining at great length the influence that the Rat Pack had on the Cherry Poppin' Daddies since the group's beginning, noting that the band regularly played covers from the Great American Songbook even during their earliest incarnation as a punk rock band: \\"[the Daddies would] be playing and the crowds would be jumping off the stage, and to chill everybody down we'd do a Sinatra tune or something...[that music's] always been in our quiver and we love that kind of vibe\\". Perry noted elsewhere, \\"I just find the easy breezy, warm evening sophistication feel of that music very attractive...so [this album] is just a nod to that side of us\\". \\"Come Back to Me\\", a song originally from the 1965 Burton Lane/Alan Jay Lerner musical On a Clear Day You Can See Forever and popularly covered by Davis, was originally covered on the Daddies' 1994 album Rapid City Muscle Car before being re-recorded for Please Return the Evening. Production history and release Throughout 2012 and into 2013, the Daddies began playing select live shows across the United States billed as \\"The Cherry Poppin' Daddies Salute the Music of the Rat Pack\\", performing an equal mix of Rat Pack covers and songs from the band's own repertoire of swing music. In the days leading up to the July 2013 release of White Teeth, Black Thoughts, Steve Perry revealed in an interview with Billboard magazine that the Daddies had nearly completed recording for their next project, a tribute to the music of the Rat Pack, and would be releasing it sometime the following year. Updates on the album's status went mostly unreported as the Daddies spent the remainder of the year touring behind White Teeth, Black Thoughts until January 2014, when Perry divulged the title of the album and a tentative release date in the summer. Starting with a performance in El Cajon, California on May 9, 2014, the Daddies discreetly began selling CD copies of Please Return the Evening exclusively at their live shows. On July 2, the band formally announced the album with a post on their website, confirming an official release date of July 29 and commencing pre-orders shortly afterwards. On July 23, The New York Times hosted a stream of the album on the Press Play media section of their website. On July 22, American Songwriter hosted an exclusive music video for the Daddies' cover of \\"Come Fly with Me\\", depicting Perry singing the song against various backdrops shot on location in The Bahamas. In a September 2 interview with The Huffington Post, Perry debuted a second video for \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", depicting the band as well as Perry's wife and daughter as members of The Addams Family, shot at the historic Shelton McMurphey Johnson House in Eugene, Oregon. Perry elaborated on the stylistic choice for the video, noting \\"we really liked the idea of the passionate Gomez and Morticia relationship. Even though the Addams' are a family of creeps, their familial love is strong. It's them against the world. We can relate to that on a family as well as a musical level\\". =Critical reception= Please Return the Evening was positively received by music critics. Jack Goodstein, writing for BlogCritics, rated the album four out of five stars, complimenting the Daddies for pulling off the material \\"in [their] own way\\" and singling out Perry as an \\"impressive vocalist\\", concluding \\"It is good to know that with the likes of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies working on it, swinging jazz, old and new, is in good hands\\". The Herald-Sun expressed similar sentiments, writing \\"only the Rat Pack is the Rat Pack, but Cherry Poppin' Daddies do a darn good job performing it as themselves\\", selecting the band's rendition of \\"That's Life\\" as a standout track.

Early life Evans grew up in South Boston. His mother died when he was 13 and his father raised Evans and his four brothers alone. When Evans was 25, his father died and Evans took on a paternal role towards his teenage brothers, one of whom, William B. Evans, served as Boston Police Commissioner from 2014 to 2018. After graduating from high school, Evans enlisted in the United States Marines Corps. He served eleven months in Vietnam during the Vietnam War and fought in the Battle of Khe Sanh. In 1969, Evans returned home. He enrolled in Boston College, found a job with the United States Postal Service, and planned on having a career in business. However, a cousin told him about the police exam and Evans signed up without giving it much thought. Early career Evans joined the Boston Police Department in 1970 as a street patrol officer. He was a member of the same class as William Bratton. In 1974, Evans graduated from Boston State College with a bachelor's degree in political science. After five years as a patrolman in Dorchester, Evans was promoted to sergeant. He served as a day supervisor in South Boston during the height of the Boston busing crisis. In 1978, Evans earned a law degree from Suffolk University Law School. That same year he was promoted to Lieutenant, where he ran the night shift in Jamaica Plain and later in Brighton. He also worked in the Field Services bureau, where he was credited with developing the data that Commissioner Joseph M. Jordan's 1983 patrol plan was based on. In 1980 he was named Deputy Superintendent. He was the commander of Area D, which consisted of the South End, Back Bay, and Allston‚ÄìBrighton. In 1985 he was a finalist for the position of Police Commissioner, however mayor Raymond Flynn instead chose Francis Roache, the head of the Community Disorders Unit and a longtime friend. In 1986 he was placed in charge of the Field Services bureau, where he oversaw all of the department's uniformed officers and half of its detectives. He was tasked with implementing a new Evan patrol plan, which included reopening the district stations in Brighton and East Boston. Although he was not a member of Roache's inner circle, he was promoted because the Flynn administration admired his ability as an administrator and because he had a reputation among the officers as being fair and straightforward. After the abolishment of the superintendent-in-chief position, Evans became the administrator of day-to-day operations and the most influential commander in the department. In February 1992, Evans was transferred to the Bureau of Investigative Services, where he was responsible for detectives and investigations. When Bratton became Police Commissioner in July 1993, Evans succeeded him as Superintendent-in-Chief. Police Commissioner When Bratton was sworn in as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, Evans became acting Commissioner. He was one of twenty-five candidates considered for the permanent by a search committee headed by former Associate Attorney General and US Attorney Wayne Budd and, along with State Police Lt. Col. Kathleen O'Toole, Boston Police Superintendent Joseph Carter, and former Chicago police commander Dennis Nowicki, was one of the four finalists presented to Mayor Thomas Menino. Menino selected Evans because he believed Evans' knowledge of the department would facilitate change without disrupting operations. Evans was sworn in on February 14, 1994. At the time of Evans' appointment, the department was suffering from instability after Bratton's tumultuous five-month reign as commissioner and crime rates were declining from historic peaks. During his tenure as Police Commissioner, Evans built coalitions with other community organizations, academics, businesses, law- enforcement agencies to develop programs, one example being a program that provided summer jobs for at-risk city youth. While Evans was Commissioner, Boston saw crime rates drop in most categories, including a dramatic drop in gang-related violence and homicides. This period of peace was known as the \\"Boston Miracle\\". In 2002 the city experienced a 31-year low in violent crime. Post-BPD career In 2003, Evans left the department to become director of the Police Standards Unit of Britain's Home Office, which assessed the performance of British police forces and helped them improve. He remained with the Home Office until 2007. After returning to the United States, Evans worked as a security consultant. In 2009 he was hired by Suffolk Downs to conduct an examination of Harrah's Entertainment, the company the track chose to partner with in its bid for a resort casino. In January 2012, Evans was hired by the owners of Suffolk Downs to run the track's security operations while they attempt to win a state license to operate a casino.

Double rose is a term used for a rose in heraldry when it has not only five petals, but additionally five petals within the outer petals.

An example of this heraldic charge is the Tudor rose, which is (most usually) a double rose gules and argent, barbed and seeded proper, but as it is so common in English heraldry it is often just blazoned as a \\"Tudor rose\\" or a \\"Tudor rose proper\\", for instance in the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, London. In botany, a double rose is a double-flowered variety of the rose, much like the heraldic double rose.

History King Albert Apartments opened in February 1918, on the southwest corner of 11th and Montgomery. The address was 385 11th Street but was changed to 1809 SW 11th Avenue according to the 1933 street renumbering system. The name King Albert may have been chosen to honor World War I hero Albert I of Belgium. Owner Herbert Gordon, a real estate developer and member of the Oregon House of Representatives, sold the property soon after completion to A.C. Ruby, a breeder of thoroughbred horses. At a cost of $125,000, the building contained 51 three-room apartments and 16 two-room apartments. Advertisements emphasized \\"strictly modern\\" units with hardwood floors, tile baths, dressing rooms, and elevator access. After the death of A.C. Ruby, ownership of the property passed to A.C. Ruby Jr., and in 1934 the building was part of a $250,000 title transfer whereby C.R. Reed, a breeder of thoroughbred horses, acquired the King Albert Apartments in exchange for the Davenport Farm in Silverton, Oregon. The farm had been the boyhood home of Homer Davenport.

Beginning in summer 2007, the value of some financial instruments backed by U.S. subprime mortgages declined sharply as it became clear that many of the borrowers would default on the mortgages. This caused a crisis as the banks holding the mortgages saw their assets decline in value and rushed to foreclose the loans.For a detailed account, see Sorkin. Swagel investigated many of these mortgages for Treasury, finding that in many cases borrowers were in homes they could not afford. In early 2008, fearing that the crisis could escalate, Paulson directed Swagel and fellow Treasury aide Neel Kashkari to write a plan to recapitalize the financial system in case of total collapse.Sorkin, pp. 83‚Äì4. The plan called for Congress to authorize Treasury to spend $500 billion to buy mortgage-backed securities from troubled banks, replacing them on banks' balance sheets with safe, liquid Treasury bills. This would prevent runs on the banks and encourage them to lend. The plan was conceived as an alternative to proposals from the staff of the House Financial Services Committee, then led by Democratic Representative Barney Frank.David Wessel. In Fed We Trust.

The film's sets were designed by the art director James Basevi. Plot Chu Chu Ramirez (Ricardo Montalban), a farm laborer from Mexico who works as a grape picker in California, has recently become an American citizen and is determined to better himself. While his cousin Manuel and his friends, Celestino and Willie, spend their pay on gambling and women, Chu Chu buys new clothes and an encyclopedia. When grape season ends, Chu Chu takes a job clearing land for Ansel Ames (Wendell Corey) on Ames' farm near Sacramento. Ames and his wife (Claire Trevor) are having marital problems, and the lonely Mrs. Ames, who initially regards Chu Chu with contempt as a \\"foreigner,\\" becomes attracted to Chu Chu over time. Chu Chu is friendly and kind to her but does not return her affections and rejects her attempt to seduce him. Instead, Chu Chu is drawn to Nancy (Shelley Winters), a troubled waitress with a drinking problem whose former husband, a test pilot, was killed in a crash. Chu Chu puts up his prized possession, a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to get money for Nancy and asks her to be his girl although she protests that he should not waste his time on a \\"wino\\" like herself. Meanwhile, Chu Chu has finished his work for Ames and receives his paycheck, but when Chu Chu goes to cash the check, the bank refuses payment. When Chu Chu confronts Ames about the bad check, Ames threatens him with a shotgun. Chu Chu brings the matter before a labor board and is promised his pay within sixty days. He plans to find Nancy, who has moved to Los Angeles and marry her as soon as he receives his pay. However, at the end of the sixty days, when Chu Chu again attempts to collect his pay, Ames attacks him, causing Chu Chu to knock him down and leave. Ames and his wife then argue and Mrs. Ames tells her husband that Chu Chu is worth ten of him, causing Ames to hit her. She falls into a gun rack and a gun goes off, striking Ames in the shoulder. The Ameses falsely accuse Chu Chu of shooting Ames, and he is arrested. After learning that Nancy has attempted suicide in Los Angeles, Chu Chu escapes from jail to rush to her side; they are briefly reunited, but police soon find Chu Chu and take him back into custody. At Chu Chu's trial, both Ames and Mrs. Ames repeat the false claim that Chu Chu shot Ames, and he is found guilty although the jury requests and the judge grants a light sentence. Nevertheless, Chu Chu will lose his citizenship for being a convict, something he considers a \\"fate worse than death.\\" Feeling that injustice has been done, Chu Chu's cousin and friends camp just outside the Ames property, staring at the Ameses, playing Mexican songs and doing other things that constantly remind the Ameses of Chu Chu. Nancy, who is still ill, arrives and accuses Mrs. Ames of destroying Chu Chu before she collapses and is rushed to the hospital. The Ameses attempt to reconcile with each other and realize that they must tell the truth that Chu Chu did not shoot Ames even though they will be charged with perjury. After their confession, Chu Chu is released and reunites with Nancy at the hospital.

Kress and starring Gilbert Roland, Glenda Farrell, and Robert Horton. The film is based on the 1939 short story \\"Stage Station\\" by Ernest Haycox. It was released by MGM on September 25, 1952. An outlaw murders several Apaches and flees to a stagecoach station with the tribe in hot pursuit. Plot Tom Herrera (Robert Horton) the head of a stagecoach station in New Mexico prepares to defend against an attack by an Apache party, seeking revenge for the killing of several Indians by an outlaw. When a stagecoach arrives at the station with passengers Nancy Dekker (Barbara Ruick) Cyril R. Snowden (Gene Lockhart) Lorraine Sayburn and Fanny Webson (Glenda Farrell) they are stranded at the station with Tom and his outlaw father Peso Herrera (Gilbert Roland). Peso is the most wanted outlaw in the country and is after the gold contained in the casket of the stagecoach. Tom knowing about his father's intention takes his guns away as a precaution. As the Apaches begin their attack, suspicion is immediately cast on Peso as the reason for the Apaches attack. Tom and Fanny defend Peso when others in the station suggest Peso be turned over to the Indians to end the conflict quickly. Tom eventually wins the argument and Peso stays in the station. However, with the help of Fanny, who gives her guns to Peso, he holds up Tom and the others and demands that they hand over the gold. Tom shoots the gun out of his father's hand. Despite the robbery attempt Tom continues to believe that his father is not responsible for the Indians attack. A fierce battle begins with the Indians and those trapped inside the station. During the fighting, an Indians emissary tries to negotiate the surrender of the murderer, but Tom again refuses to turn his father over and the fighting resumes. During the battle, Peso knocks out Pike Curtis (Myron Healey) who Peso knows is the killer and turns him over to the Indians. With all doubt about his father removed Tom stays behind with Nancy while the stagecoach leaves for San Francisco. Later, Nancy informs Tom that the gold is not as safe as he thinks because the young boy assigned to guard the gold is actually another one of Peso's sons.

He released a self-titled album in October 2012. It received some international attention and together with his band Miller had toured internationally. Bored Nothing's second album, Some Songs, appeared in October 2014. Miller died by suicide after bouts of depression, and is survived by his wife, Anna Davidson (of Major Leagues and Pansy). Career Fergus Miller was based in Melbourne. He listed his influences as My Bloody Valentine, Brian Jonestown Massacre and Elliott Smith. As a teenager he developed an interest in music and \\"started making little demos.\\" He acquired an \\"old 4-track I got for cheap\\" and began to share them with friends. He put them \\"on disc and leaving them around in pubs and record stores,\\" and self-released the material through various outlets and formats including Bandcamp, CD-R and compact cassettes. Recording as Bored Nothing, Miller signed to Spunk records in 2012. His debut was a self-titled 14-track album released via Spunk/Cooperative Music in October. Miller plays \\"every [instrument] on the album (save one guitar part and a keyboard line), as well as recording and producing the thing at home.\\" He began recording tracks in 2011, towards the end of 2012 he collected nine from previous releases in addition to five new ones, specifically recorded for Bored Nothing. The album received an international release in April 2013 while a track, \\"I Wish You Were Dead\\", was made available as a stream, and a music video, \\"Let Down\\", directed by Abteen Bagheri, appeared in September.\\"Listing\\" Editor, 'Bored Nothing: Let Down', Nowness, 9 September 2013. At Metacritic his album received an average score of 70, based on seven reviews. Bored Nothing received generally positive reviews from music critics with some negative comments. AllMusic's Tim Sendra felt, \\"[he is] the head of the '90s revival class. From the beginning, it's easy to see that he has a firm grasp on the things that made the indie rock of the time so good.\\" Kat Waplington of Drowned in Sound observed, \\"[it has] little more than apathetic melancholy with scant musical interest to back it up.\\" In August 2014 Miller announced the release of his second Bored Nothing album, Some Songs, preceded by the single, \\"Ice-Cream Dreams\\". Sendra noticed the album, \\"[has] a fair balance of hissy ballads that sound like they were recorded with Elliott Smith's ghost perched on his shoulder and shambling pop songs that have sneaky big hooks, [it] has a nice, relaxed flow and depth that represent a step forward in every way.\\" Bored Nothing played its final show at The Northcote Social Club on 10 January 2015 and was retired. Miller then worked with other projects, including sound mixing on Major Leagues' second EP, Dream States (2015), in Brisbane. Followed by his next solo vehicle, Wedding Ring Bells, back in Melbourne, which he described, \\"it's more about embracing the quieter songs. I‚Äôve spent years playing loud music and I wanted to get back to the intimacy of playing mostly by myself.\\" Miller and his wife, Anna Davidson (of Major Leagues) formed a duo, Pansy, which performed on 7 October 2016 at the Post Office Hotel, Coburg. Mapado writer described how, \\"their sound is 100% home made and full to the brim with gloomy bedroom-pop vibrations.\\" On 9 October 2016 Fergus Miller, after another bout of depression, committed suicide at the age of 26.http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4555645.htm He is survived by his wife, Anna Davidson. Tributes from other Australian bands were received including Major Leagues and the John Steel Singers. In November 2016 Bored Nothing were listed by Triple J as one of the top 100 best discoveries of the last decade from their Unearthed scheme.  Style  Miller's vocals and delivery received immediate comparisons to Elliott Smith, especially on acoustic tracks like \\"Get Out of Here\\" and \\"Charlie's Creek\\". However the composition of his music is often considered shoegaze or dream pop with its layered vocals, reverb and fuzzy guitars. Critics have made comparisons to fellow shoegaze artists Ride, Silversun Pickups, Teenage Fanclub and My Bloody Valentine.  Bored Nothing Band  Although Miller was the sole writer, recorder and producer of the band's music, Bored Nothing Band, comprised several people he had brought on board over the duration of his live performance career. * Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar ‚Äì Fergus Miller * Drums ‚Äì Jamie King-Holden * Lead Guitar ‚Äì Gary Valenta * Bass ‚Äì Harrison Miller Carr (Miller's younger brother) Discography=Albums= *Bored Nothing (Cooperative Music, 29 October 2012) *#Shit for Brains ‚Äì 3:03 *#Popcorn ‚Äì 3:58 *#Just Another Maniac ‚Äì 3:33 *#Bliss ‚Äì 5:04 *#Darcy ‚Äì 1:58 *#I Wish You Were Dead ‚Äì 4:04 *#Echo Room ‚Äì 2:49 *#Get Out of Here ‚Äì 2:44 *#Let Down ‚Äì 4:14 *#Snacks ‚Äì 3:41 *#Charlie's Creek ‚Äì 4:55 *#Only Old ‚Äì 3:16 *#Build a Bridge ‚Äì 3:30 *#Dragville, TN ‚Äì 2:22 *Some Songs (Spunk, 20 October 2014) *#Not *#Ice- cream Dreams *#The Rough *#We Lied *#Ultra-lites *#Do What You Want, Always *#Why Were You Dancing with all Those Guys *#Where Would I Begin *#Come Back To *#Song for Jedder *#Don't Get Sentimental *#Artificial Flower *#Ultra-lites II =Extended plays= * BN (self-released, 2012) *#Just Another Maniac ‚Äì 3:33 *#Charlie's Creek ‚Äì 4:57 *#Only Old ‚Äì 3:17 *#We Swim ‚Äì 5:18 *#Pay For My Drugs ‚Äì 4:10 *#Lover's Croon ‚Äì 3:49 * Thanks for the Mammaries (self-released, 2013) *#Slipped Between The Seams ‚Äì 2:15 *#Just Because ‚Äì 2:47 *#Dial Tone Blues ‚Äì 2:41 *#Stuck ‚Äì 2:32 References Category:1990 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Male suicides Category:Musicians from Melbourne Category:Australian musicians who committed suicide Category:Rock musicians who committed suicide Category:Suicides in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Bored Nothing"},{"id":"41592368","text":"Kyrgyzstan‚ÄìMalaysia relations refers to foreign relations between Kyrgyzstan and Malaysia.

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 5, 2014. Plot Worried that Louise does not have any friends, Linda throws a surprise slumber party consisting of four of Louise's female classmates, none of whom Louise likes: over-talkative Harley, \\"germaphobe\\" Jodi, compulsive braider Abby, and boring Jessica. Louise resolves to drive each girl away and end the party. She tells Jodi that Linda suffers from numerous infections; scares Harley into believing that Gene's secret, deformed, violent twin is about to be let out from the Belcher's basement; and refuses to allow Abby to braid her hair. Each girl demands to be driven home, leaving only Jessica, who went to bed early. When Louise goes to drag Jessica out of bed, she finds only a walkie-talkie, over which Jessica tells her that a possession of hers is missing. Suspecting Louise stole it to mess with her, she refuses to leave until her possession is returned to her, and won't tell Louise what it is. In the course of tracking down Jessica in the apartment, Louise finds her to be much more mysterious, resourceful, and cunning than she initially thought. Louise spies Jessica hiding behind a curtain, and a pillow fight ensues between the girls. Meanwhile, Linda's fascination with an alley raccoon, whom she dubbed \\"Little King Trash-mouth\\" in \\"Two for Tina,\\" reaches its peak when he is ousted from his territory by a larger raccoon (dubbed \\"El Diablo\\"). Linda takes in Little King Trash-mouth, and she, Bob, and Teddy conspire to remove El Diablo and \\"reinstate the king.\\" After the racoon escapes Bob and Linda's bedroom, the kids find him carrying Jessica's missing item: a pair of urine-soiled pajama bottoms. Impressed with Jessica's method of keeping her bedwetting secret at slumber parties, Louise assures her that she won't tell anyone at school. They bond over their pillow fighting skills and overbearing mothers. Louise invites her to stay the night and Linda delights at Louise finding a friend in Jessica. In the alley outside the restaurant, Teddy catches El Diablo using a trap with one of Bob's burgers as bait. Bob shoos Little King Trash-mouth out of the house, and Linda leaves some red wine out for Little King Trash-mouth. Reception Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, specifically discussing how the episode further illustrates Louise's characterization as someone who \\"can be mean...but [is] not evil\\". He also noted a fondness for Jessica and the development of Louise's character, stating, \\"Out of all of Louise‚Äôs previous enemies, I think Jessica is my favorite. She‚Äôs on Louise‚Äôs level: Jessica is clever, she doesn‚Äôt give up, she knows how to pick locks, and she understands what makes Louise tick...The two girls even end up bonding over their crazy mothers and pillow-fighting skills. Louise isn‚Äôt going to morph into a social butterfly with a giggly best friend, but this is a nice step in the right direction.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.6 out of ten, saying, \\"I have to admit that this is the episode I laughed the least at...[T]here wasn‚Äôt a huge amount of stuff to guffaw at. Instead, 'Slumber Party' turned out to be the most subtly heartwarming edition of the show‚Äôs fourth season, with Linda‚Äôs worries for her eccentric kids and Louise‚Äôs slight insecurities leaching in to the story quietly. That is flat out exceptional scriptwriting, folks, and another reason why you shouldn‚Äôt miss out on the peerless run Bob‚Äôs Burgers is on.\\" The episode received a 2.9 rating and was watched by a total of 6.35 million people. This made it the second watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating American Dad! and Family Guy but losing to The Simpsons with 12.04 million.

He was the President of All India Muslim Educational Conference until his death in 2010. He was a member of the Executive Board of Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library.  Works  * Husain's magnum opus, Muqaddama- e-tareekh-e-zaban-e-Urdu, describes in detail the history of Urdu's origin and development. On account of coherence and plausibility, the book is considered to offer one of the most acceptable theories on the genesis and development of Urdu. He proved his theory with historical evidence, taking into account the formation of Indo-Aryan languages. Keeping in view the theories of historical linguistics and ancient sources, he proved that Urdu was born in and around Delhi. According to him, four vernacular dialects, namely Braj Bhasha, Mewati, Haryanvi and Khariboli, exerted their influences on Urdu during its long formative phases and among them Haryanvi and Khariboli were the ones that proved to be more decisive. Later, the same language reached Deccan in the 13th and 14th centuries AD with the Muslim armies and slowly gained refinement over the centuries and a standard Urdu language emerged. Before Masud Husain, Muhammad Husain Azad, Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani, Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri, Mohiuddin Qadri Zore, Syed Sulaiman Nadvi, T. Grahame Bailey and some other scholars had presented their theories on Urdu's origin but none found favour with Masud Husain. In his opinion, the emergence of these modern Indo-Aryan dialects could not have begun earlier than 1000 AD and, therefore, Hafiz Mehmood Shirani's theory that saw the Punjab region as the cradle of Urdu and premised that Urdu was a language that was brought to Delhi by Muslim armies after the conquest of Punjab, was not plausible. First published in 1948, the book, originally his PhD dissertation, has run into many editions in India and Pakistan. * His second book Urdu Zaban-o-Adab written in 1954 was equally popular. * Husain was the first to analyse the words of Urdu from the phonetic and phonological point of view. During his stay in London, Husain had a chance to benefit from the insights of Professor J. R. Firth who was the first to introduce the concept of 'Prosodic Phonology'. Basing his D.Litt. thesis A phonetic and phonological study of the word in Urdu on Firth's theory, he carried out research that was published in 1954. It was translated into Urdu by Professor Mirza Khalil Ahmad Beg under the title Urdu Lafz ka Sautiyati aur Tajz-sautiyati Mutalia, and was published by the Department of Linguistics, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh in 1984. * Another sphere of Husain's scholarly interest was Literary criticism but at the beginning of his literary career, he used to scoff at the then prevalent trend of criticism that indulged in flowery language and had become too rhetoric. The so-called 'impressionistic school of literary criticism' used to eulogise literary works in a way that reeked of romanticism and based evaluation on subjectivity rather than on any literary theory. Stylistics (field of study), in Urdu called Uslubiyat, is a significant branch of Applied linguistics. During his stay in the US, he was inspired by the theory of stylistics presented by Professor Archibald A. Hill. He then began applying linguistics to Urdu literary criticism and wrote many articles on Ghalib, Muhammad Iqbal and Fani Badayuni, not only presenting the linguistic critical analysis of their poetry but also laying the foundations for what came to be known as Linguistic Criticism in Urdu which later served as a launching pad for other well-known Urdu critics such as Gopi Chand Narang, Mughni Tabassum and Mirza Khalil Ahmad Beg. * His assertion that Prem Chand's Urdu novel Godaan is not Prem Chand's original work in Urdu but a translation of Prem Chand's Hindi novel by the same title and that it was rendered into Urdu by Iqbal Bahadur Varma Sahar took the literary world by storm. Many doubted Husain's intentions. Manik Toula, a Prem Chand scholar, said Husain was trying to 'disown' Chand as an Urdu writer. Even a scholar of Gian Chand Jain's stature accused Husain of 'literary Jihad'. But the evidence brought to light by Husain was so genuine that it had to be accepted that the Urdu rendering of Godaan began only after Prem Chand's death. * Husain commands respect of Urdu researchers when it comes to editing classical Urdu texts. Aside from other rare manuscripts discovered and edited by Husain, Qissa-e-Mahr Afroz-o-Dilbar, edited and annotated by him, is a work that brought to light an important rare 'daastaan'. * He had a rare insight into Dakhini and Dakhiniyat. He calls the Dakhini Dialect of Urdu 'the Old Urdu'. A work of his on Dakhini is the compilation and publication of a Dakhini Urdu dictionary that has been compiled on the basis of a large number of rare and unpublished manuscripts, citing the couplets of Dakhini along with the words and meanings. * In his monograph on Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Husain re-evaluated the poetry of Quli Qutb Shah for the benefit of the Urdu readers. * He has a large number of books to his credit, including his autobiography Wurood-e-Masood and the collection of his poetry Do Neem, all of which are considered as valuable contribution to Urdu prose and linguistics. * In his brief stay of almost one and a quarter-year at Iqbal Institute, he published several papers of Allama Iqbal and his poetry in different journals including Iqbaaliyaat, the journal of Iqbal Institute Kashmir University. * He was also the Chief Editor of Urdu- Urdu Lughat. * When he came to Pakistan in the early 1980s, the Urdu Dictionary Board consulted him on their flagship dictionary.  Awards and honours  * It was at Iqbal Institute where he finished his book Iqbal Ki Nazari-o-Amali Sheriyat (Criticism) for which Husain received Sahitya Akademi award in 1984. * He was conferred with Delhi Urdu Academy's highest honour ‚Äì Kul Hind Bahadur Shah Zafar Award‚Äîin recognition of his contribution to the study of Urdu language and literature in March 2010. * In February 2010 Ghalib Institute, New Delhi felicitated him in a grand function for his yeoman contribution to Urdu language and literature.Urdu Scholar Professor Masood Husain Khan felicitated * He was granted the designation of \\"Professor Emeritus\\" by the Aligarh Muslim University in 1987, the first in Social Sciences. * He was also awarded the Karachi Niaz Fatehpuri Award in 1986. * Besides, he was given Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy Award on his book Urdu ka Alamia in 1974. This book was edited by Professor Mirza Khalil Ahmad Beg. * A felicitation volume Nazr-e-Masud (edited by Professor Mirza Khalil Ahmad Beg) was presented to him on his 70th Birth Anniversary in 1989 in a function held at Jamia Urdu, Aligarh. * After his death (16 October 2010), Professor Mirza Khalil Ahmad Beg wrote a book titled Masud Husain Khan: ahwal-o-aasar to commemorate his 5th death anniversary.

This was the result of a conflict between the Binkhorst (and a German bootbuilder) and the ISCYRA about the creation of an unsinkable Star. One outcome was that the team of Binkhorst and Willem van Walt Meijer did not start at the Worlds and missed an opportunity to qualify for the Olympics. Binkhorst became European Champion Finn in 1971 and 2e at the Worldchampionship Finn in 1975. Both after long periods of not participating because of professional obligations Professional life Binkhorst studied Medicine at the Groningen University. Later he worked as Physician, e.g. at the Sportmedisch Adviescentrum, Amersfoort.

Where occupations are not subject to statutory regulation, it sets standards for those organisations that hold voluntary registers and accredits those that meet them. Until 30 November 2012 it was known as the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE). It is an independent body, which is accountable to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It assesses the performance of each regulator, conducts audits, scrutinises their decisions and reports to Parliament. It seeks to achieve balance in the oversight of regulation through the application of the concept of right-touch regulation. History The Health Act 1999 allowed the UK government to more easily change healthcare regulatory arrangements, through orders of the Privy Council. The Kennedy report into the Bristol heart scandal was published in July 2001 and plans for a body to oversee the regulation of healthcare professionals in the UK quickly followed. The Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) was set up under the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002. The CHRE was succeeded by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care, which was set up under section 222 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Oversight of the regulators The Authority covers the 9 statutory bodies that regulate health professionals in the UK and social workers in England: * General Chiropractic Council * General Dental Council * General Medical Council * General Optical Council * General Osteopathic Council * Health and Care Professions Council * Nursing and Midwifery Council * Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland * General Pharmaceutical Council Voluntary registers The Authority also has a role in encouraging the upkeep of standards in practitioners that are not subject to regulation. Accredited registers are a voluntary scheme where the PSA sets out some standards that are applicable to organisations that deal with occupations that are not statutorily regulated. The PSA accredits organisations that hold voluntary registers, offering a \\"quality mark\\" to those that show they have met various standards. In July 2019 there were 25 organisations with voluntary registers that had been given accreditation. Accreditation of a voluntary register does not mean that the PSA endorses a particular approach or therapy. The Authority is not concerned whether any of the methodologies used by societies on this scheme have any scientific validity. It regards the question of scientific veracity as a matter of opinion. Funding The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all fund the authority, with contributions in line with the Barnett formula. Limits on Powers The PSA has no powers to investigate individual complaints about the regulators it oversees, nor to compel them to take any specific action. Its website states ‚ÄúWe do not investigate individuals‚Äô complaints about regulators or registers and cannot resolve them for you.‚Äù Premises Regulation The PSA's focus is on the regulation of individuals ‚Äì and not premises ‚Äì though it oversees both the General Pharmaceutical Council and the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland, which both have responsibility for premises regulation. Its website states: ‚ÄúWe help to protect the public by improving the regulation and registration of people who work in health and care.‚Äù As such, there is a significant gap in the oversight of pharmacy premises regulation in the UK. The PSA's Standards of Good Regulation are accordingly focused on the regulation of individuals and not premises. Its website claims untruthfully that ‚ÄúThe Standards cover all aspects of the regulators‚Äô work including where the regulator has responsibility for businesses and premises as well as individuals.‚Äù The standards contain no specific mention of premises; none of the individual standards are focused on premises; they do not invite separation of results where a regulator has responsibility for regulating both individuals and premises and they make no mention of inspection outcomes. Many of the standards are exclusively focused on individuals; for example, they refer to a ‚Äúregistrant‚Äù, which by definition is a person who has registered; a set of premises cannot register itself. It is capable of being registered, but incapable of being a registrant. In addition, references to ‚Äúfitness to practise‚Äù in its standards do not apply to premises, since premises cannot themselves ‚Äúpractise‚Äù. Such terms are not used in reference to premises regulation. There are no measures relating to the success of any applicable inspection regime (e.g. outcomes by standards type, premises type or stage of sanction) nor of the systemic/environmental effects of standards in premises on patient safety. Its lack of focus on premises regulation can be seen, for example, in its report on the GPhC for 2018/19, which contains very little mention, focus or insight into premises regulation.

He was known as a Persian scholar, and also was a churchman and academic. Life Born on 30 September 1781, was the only son of Thomas Keene, and was a grandson of Henry Keene the architect; his mother was Jane, sister of George Harris, 1st Baron Harris. He was educated privately, partly by Jacques-Fran√ßois Menou. Keene went to India as a cadet in the Madras Presidency army about 1798, and shortly after became adjutant of a sepoy regiment, which formed part of the brigade commanded by Colonel Arthur Wellesley. In May 1799 it took part in the siege of Seringapatam, where Keene led the company carrying the scaling-ladders for the storming party (4 May). In poor health, he obtained an appointment in the Madras civil service through his uncle, Lord Harris, the commander-in-chief, in February 1801. After a short visit to England he entered Fort William College in Calcutta, then newly established, for the training of young civil officers. In January 1804 Keene passed out at Fort William in the first class. He had honours in Persian and Arabic, with prizes in classics, English composition, French, and gold medal in Islamic law, having held public disputations in Arabic and Persian. Joining the East India Company service at Madras, he became in turn registrar of the district court at Rajamundri, and assistant-registrar to the sudder courts at the presidency. In 1805 he went to Europe, and in 1809 returned to India, where he incurred the displeasure of Sir George Barlow, the governor. As a result, he gave up his post. On 13 November 1811 Keene matriculated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1815. Shortly afterwards he retired from the Indian civil service. He was admitted fellow of his college on 13 November 1817, and took holy orders, being ordained priest in 1819. At this period he visited the continent, in company with Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope, and met Archduke John of Austria and Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, with both of whom he kept up a correspondence. In March 1819 he unsuccessfully contested Sir Thomas Adams's Chair of Arabic at Cambridge University. In 1824 Keene became professor of Arabic and Persian at the East India College, Haileybury, where he was later appointed registrar. There his celebrity attracted visitors. In 1834 he resigned his posts at Haileybury, and went to live at Tunbridge Wells, where he spent the rest of his life. He died there on 29 January 1864. Works Around 1804, in India, Keene wrote a book on law in Arabic, for which the British government awarded him 10,000 rupees. Other published works were: * Akhl√°k-i-Mahsini, lithograph text and translation, and a book of the Anw√°r-i-Suhaili, also text and translation (Hertford); * Persian Fables (London), 1833; * Persian Stories (London), 1835; * Sermons of Rev. W. Sharpe, with a memoir, 1836. The Persian Fables were translated into Tamil in 1840, and a new edition was published in 1880 by his daughter Katharine. Keene assisted his friend Adam Clarke in the philological part of his Commentary on the Bible. He stopped work on a Persian grammar, because Mirza Muhammed Ibrahim, his assistant, had written one, and never published his writing on Persian history. Family In 1824 Keene married Anne, daughter of Charles Apthorp Wheelwright, formerly of Boston, Massachusetts, a loyalist refugee. He left two sons and two daughters.

History Hughes House in 2011 The Hughes House was constructed in approximately 1867 by a local carpenter as a guest house, located on the stagecoach road between Traverse City and Petoskey. In 1877, it was purchased by settlers John and Martha Hughes. They operated it until 1898, when their daughter, Alice Hughes Butler, inherited the house. She added the veranda and remodeled the interior into a family dwelling. Alice Hughes Butler lived in the house for many years, and her daughter, Josephine Butler Cary, continued living there until at least 1980. The House was most recently purchased in July 2014 by Matthew and Anne Conrad of Elk Rapids as their permanent residence. Recent improvements include foundation re-support and insulation of the exterior walls. Description The Hughes House is a rectangular 2-1/2-story frame house with a gable roof and clapboard siding on a fieldstone foundation.
