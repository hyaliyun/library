The Miniature Lion Lop is a breed of domestic rabbit recognised by the British Rabbit Council. The breed is not currently recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association. In addition to its lop ears, the distinguishing feature of this breed is its Lionhead-type mane and its small size: . The Miniature Lion Lop was developed in England in the early 2000s and accepted by the British Rabbit Council in 2006. Breeder Jane Bramley was responsible for much of the work required to achieve formal breed recognition. The Miniature Lion Lop is similar to the Miniature Lop, but with a mane around the head and a bib on the chest. The breed is growing in popularity within the UK.  Breeding  Ovulation is induced by sexual stimulation. Sexual maturity age for small breeds like the Miniature Lion Lop is 4 to 5 months. Males usually require more time to mature, and normally reach adult sperm counts between 6‚Äì7 months. Due to the territorial nature of female rabbits, it is standard practice for the doe to always be brought to the buck's cage. When the doe is brought to the bucks' cage, he quickly mounts her, performs pelvic thrusting culminating in ejaculation, and \\"flops\\" off. The whole act may take less than 30 seconds, and is often repeated several times. When he is finished, the buck should then be removed, but many breeders will reintroduce the buck a few hours later to increase the size of the litter.  Mane  The maning gene is dominant, therefore, both parents do not need a mane to pass it on to offspring; however, one parent have a mane. It cannot be \\"carried\\" by Mini Lops. There are two genes involved - 'M' and 'm'. *The mm would be a rabbit with no mane (so this would be a Mini Lop). *The Mm would be a rabbit with a single mane. *The MM would be a rabbit with a double mane. So some possible outcomes may be: *mm √ó mm = 100% mm, so all Mini Lop offspring in the litter. *mm √ó Mm = 50% mm and 50% Mm, so half Mini Lop and half single-maned Mini Lion Lop offspring in the litter. *mm √ó MM = 100% Mm, so all single-maned Mini Lion Lop offspring in the litter. *Mm √ó Mm = 50% Mm, 25% mm, and 25% MM *Mm √ó MM = 50% Mm and 50% MM *MM √ó MM = 100% MM Double- maned Mini Lion Lop kits are easily recognisable. They are often informally referred to as \\"gremlins\\", because of their appearance. Compared to a single maned kit, there is a large difference. \\"Gremlins\\" tend to have a V shape on the back, where the fur starts to grow.  Colours and standardisation  Miniature Lion Lop fanciers are still currently working on getting all the colours standardised, because the Breeds Standards Committee have not allowed all colours that are accepted by other Lop breeds to be accepted within the Miniature Lion Lops. Three generations (with a minimum of two specimens in each generation) of show-quality Miniature Lion Lops are required in the colour the breeders wish to be accepted. Colours currently accepted are: *White (red- or blue-eyed) *Black *Blue *Agouti *Opal *Iron grey *Sooty fawn *Fawn *Orange *Light Siamese sable *Medium Siamese sable *Dark Siamese sable *Siamese smoke *Black fox *Black otter *Steel *Beige *Chocolate *Seal-point *Blue-point *Butterfly pattern File:Upton's Butter, Mini Lion Lop.jpgUpton's Butter, fawn Mini Lion Lop.

A uniform pink shade of dove is called for by the breed standard, with matching eyes. Lilacs are mid-sized, docile and hardy rabbits. Developed in Great Britain in the early 20th century, the breed spread to the United States in 1922. Population numbers remain low enough that it is currently listed by The Livestock Conservancy as a breed to watch. The Lilac breed is recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC) (where it is not currently considered rare) and the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). Description The British breed standard calls for Lilac rabbits to be an \\"even pink shade of dove colour\\" over the entire body, with matching eye colour. White hairs on the body (including armpits) or toes, a blue cast to the coat, or a nose that is brown or \\"putty\\" coloured are penalized in showing. The Lilac is a mid- sized rabbit, hardy, slow-maturing and docile. At maturity, males weight and females . While the does are good mothers, litter sizes are small, averaging 4 to 6 kits. History The first breeder of lilac-coloured rabbits is thought to be an H. Onslow of Cambridge, England, who began exhibiting them in London in 1913. Lilac-coloured rabbits were also produced the same year by Mabel Illingworth, who crossed Blue Imperials with Havana rabbits. In 1917, a Gouda, Holland breeder named C.H. Spruty crossed Blue Beverens with Havanas to create a larger lilac rabbit called the Gouda or Gowenaar. The Cambridge Blue was created in 1922, by Cambridge University professor R.C. Punnet, by using the same cross as Spruty. The rabbits bred by Illingworth, Spruty and Punnet were merged, creating the Lilac rabbit breed. Due to the number of bloodlines within the breed and breeder preference, the exact shade of colour and size show great variety. In 1922, the first exports were made from Britain to the US, and through 1926, many additional rabbits were sent. There was initially substantial interest in the breed in the US, especially on the west coast, but the breed never achieved the popularity that other rabbit breeds did. By 1940, Lilacs were being shown at the ARBA national show, and in 1944, the National Lilac Rabbit Club of America was formed. After this, the breed's popularity waned, and by 1951 the club, and most breeders, had become inactive. That year, only six members of the breed were shown at the national show. In 1952, the club was reorganized and restarted, and population numbers began to climb. The breed association is Great Britain is called the National Lilac Club. Although the Livestock Conservancy currently considers the Lilac a rare breed, (placing the breed at \\"watch\\" status, meaning there is a global population of fewer than 2,000 specimens and there are fewer than 200 registrations in the US each year), the BRC does not currently include the Lilac in its \\"Rare Varieties Club\\" designation. In the 21st century, Lilacs have won Best in Show or Reserve Best in Show at numerous national and state all-breed ARBA shows.

It was released for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64 (C64), MS-DOS, Macintosh, MSX, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), PC-88, and Sharp X68000. During 1990 and 1991, the game was released in HuCard cartridge and CD-ROM formats for the U.S TurboGrafx-16 and its foreign counterpart, PC Engine. The TurboGrafx-16 versions of the game were titled Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf, while the PC Engine version was titled Jack Nicklaus World Golf Tour for the CD-ROM format. A Game Boy version was released as Jack Nicklaus Golf in 1992. It was the first in a series of golf games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus, and was followed by Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design (1990). Gameplay The game features Jack Nicklaus' favorite 18 golf holes, all put together in a single course, which includes holes from Augusta National Golf Club, Muirfield, Pebble Beach Golf Links, Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club, and Old Course at St Andrews. Two courses designed by Nicklaus are also featured in the game: Castle Pines (Colorado) and Desert Mountain (Arizona). Additionally, the Game Boy version includes Muirfield Village as a course. Several add-on disks were released for the computer versions to add additional courses. The game features two game modes: Stroke Play and Skins. A multiplayer option allows for a maximum total of four players being able to play. The player can also compete against a selection of eight different CPU players that includes Jack Nicklaus. An image of Nicklaus also appears in between holes as he gives tips to the player. Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf, for the TurboGrafx-16, differs from the other versions. In CD-ROM format, the game has five courses, including Castle Pines. The other courses were previously featured in the game's early add-on disks: The Australian Golf Club, Royal Troon Golf Club, Kemper Lakes Golf Club, and St. Creek Golf Club. The CD-ROM version allows the player to take a 360-degree look around any of the courses, and Nicklaus appears in between courses to give advice about each hole. The HuCard cartridge version of Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf includes only one course, The Australian Golf Club, and includes eight golfer rivals, as well as Jack Nicklaus. Release Accolade began publishing Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf in 1988. It had the longest title of any software product at the time of its release. By August 1989, versions had been released in the United Kingdom for the Commodore 64 and PC, while other versions for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST were scheduled for release that autumn. An Apple II version had been released by late 1989. As of 1990, a Macintosh version had been published by Accolade. The NES version, published by Konami, was released in the United States in March 1990, while a United Kingdom release came in August 1991. Versions were also released for the MSX, PC-88, and Sharp X68000. For the U.S. TurboGrafx-16, the game was released as Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf, in HuCard and CD-ROM formats. The game was also released for the TurboGrafx-16's foreign counterpart, the PC Engine. In the CD-ROM format, the PC Engine version was published under the title Jack Nicklaus' World Golf Tour, while the game in HuCard format retained the original Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf title. Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf and its foreign counterparts were released in 1990 and 1991. The Game Boy version, Jack Nicklaus Golf, was released in the United States in May 1992; it was published by Tradewest, along with an unrelated game with the same title for the Super NES. Reception Computer versions The computer versions of the game received criticism for the slow load times in generating each new screen. Some criticized the computer version for including an off-disc copy protection scheme, which was deemed as difficult to use. Some critics favorably compared the game with the Leader Board golfing game series. Some praise was given for the graphics of the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 versions. Amstrad Action called the CPC version, \\"Beyond a shadow of a doubt the best golf sim ever on a CPC.\\" However, the magazine also wrote that the game would \\"only immediately appeal\\" to golf fans and people who have played computer golf games, while stating, \\"These limitations will unfairly cripple the game's popularity ‚Äì a crime, because it's an entertaining and well-programmed sports sim.\\" CU Amiga-64 praised the Amiga version's gameplay but was critical of the minimal sounds, the putting, and the \\"agonisingly slow\\" computer golfer opponent. Zzap!64 reviewed the Commodore 64 version and criticized the sound effects, as well as the blocky scenery and its unusual color schemes. The Games Machine, reviewing the CPC and ST versions, criticized the blocky scenery and its murky colors, as well as simple sound effects and poorly animated golfer sprites. Reviewing the Amiga version, the magazine praised the digitized image of Jack Nicklaus that appears in between holes, but criticized the rest of the graphics. Tom Malcom of .info reviewed the Commodore 64 version; he called the graphics adequate and the sound \\"abominable,\\" and concluded that the game, overall, was a good choice. Malcom subsequently reviewed the Amiga version; he praised the gameplay but felt the graphics were \\"not what they could, and should, be.\\" He also wished there had been an option to turn off Jack Nicklaus' advice before each hole, stating that it slowed down the gameplay considerably. Bob Wade of Amiga Format praised the sound. Tony Hetherington of Your Amiga criticized bad putting controls. He called the game \\"perfectly playable and competently programmed,\\" but still considered it bland. Amiga Action praised the game and recommended it, but considered Leader Board to be superior. Amiga User International recommended the game for people who had not already purchased Mean 18, a similar golf game also by Accolade. Dan Muse of inCider praised the Apple II version as \\"a new standard in computer golf games\\" and \\"the best sports game, period.\\" Regarding the image of Nicklaus that appears in between holes, Muse wrote, \\"Okay, it's a little corny, but I like it.\\" Michael Dashe of Macworld praised the Macintosh version for its graphics, realistic gameplay, and variety of courses. Other versions The NES and TurboGrafx-16 versions were also criticized for slow reanimation. Raze reviewed the NES version and stated that because of its easy gameplay, it was more fun to play it with other people rather than alone. Mean Machines criticized the NES version for its blocky scenery, stating that it hampered gameplay. The magazine also criticized the golfer sprite, the \\"average\\" sound effects, and the lack of music, and concluded that it was a \\"very tedious golf sim, which only die-hard fans of the genre should take a chance on.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times, reviewing one of the game's versions, wrote, \\"Great for golfing enthusiasts and good for those who are new to golf.\\" Chip and Jonathan Carter, writing for the Philadelphia Daily News, reviewed the TurboGrafx-16 cartridge version and stated that additional courses would have been nice, although they praised the gameplay and graphics. GamePro reviewed the TurboGrafx-16 CD-ROM version and recommended the game for golf fans, but criticized the slow reanimation and stated that the game did not offer much to distinguish it from other golf games.

Career Abramovich began teaching Hebrew language and literature at The Centre for Jewish History and Culture. He was appointed Centre Director in 2006. He has taught a range of subjects including Hebrew language at various levels as well Introduction to Modern Jewish Culture, Israeli Film, A History of Israel, A History of the Arab Israeli conflict, \\"Jerusalem in Jewish Literature\\", \\"Reading the Holocaust\\" and \\"Israel: Conflicts and Culture\\". He has helped foster links between Israeli and Australian tertiary institutions. An area of interest are the works of Israeli author Amos Oz, Abramovich nominated Oz for an honorary Doctor of Letters which the writer was awarded at The University of Melbourne in August 2011. Abramovich has also served as editor of the Australian Journal of Jewish Studies (from 2002 to 2010) and as President of the Australian Association for Jewish Studies. He has authored a number of books. He has been co-editor of the 2008 book Testifying to the Holocausthttp://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4696058 and author of Back to the Future: Israeli Literature of the 1980s and 1990s, as well as Hebrew Classics: A Journey Through Israel Timeless Prose and Poetryhttps://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-Classics-Journey-Through- Timeless/dp/1936235943  Criticism  Abramovich has received criticism from a number of sources for his stances in various publications, such as the AJDS, New Matilda, and Galus Australis. The main criticism is that he has become a mouthpiece for Israeli government positions and he is using his platform at the Anti-Defamation Commission to push back against anti-Zionist sentiment, rather than focusing on racism and bigotry. Other activities Abramovich has been a columnist at The Australian Jewish News since 2001, authoring the Counterpunch column.http://www.jewishnews.net.au/bring-in-those-who-marry- out/20195 He has also contributed opinion pieces for both Fairfax and News Ltd publications. Abramovich is notable within the Jewish community and at times has been asked to speak at communal events, such as the Melbourne Writers Festival, Melbourne Film Festival as well as being interviewed at times on ABC Radio.http://antonyloewenstein.com/?s=dvir Abramovich is also the chairman of the Anti-Defamation Commission, whose purview is to fight all racism and hate, although Abramovich has shifted the focus of the organisation to Antisemitism, Holocaust trivialization and Israel advocacy. Exploitation of the Holocaust Abramovich has been a regularly speaks out against Holocaust trivialization and any perceived exploitation for ideological and artistic purposes. He has criticized the tendency to use the Holocaust as material for Hollywood films, and opposes the use of Holocaust imagery by artists and comedians. One of Abramovich's targets in preventing the use of Holocaust imagery are comedians, since he does not think the topic should ever be used in comedic settings Abramovich took issue with a skit by John Safran on his 2009 show Race Relations in which the presenter made out in Anne Frank's attic with his supposed girlfriend Katherine Hicks, whom Safran described as a \\"A Blonde haired Aryan\\". Abramovich wrote that \\"Safran's exploitative approach drains the Holocaust of its tragic context (the death camps, the starvation, the shootings, the burning of bodies, the mounds of hair, shoes and glasses)\\". Another comedic stunt by Safran that Abramovich reacted to was a mock-gassing of Holocaust denier David Irving. Abramovich saying \\"Why didn't anyone tell him (Safran)... that there was no humour to be mined from atrocity, that trivialising genocide for silly comic pay-off is inexcusable?\\"http://www.jewishnews.net.au/no-laughing-matter/10074 Abramovich's focus on the use of the Holocaust elicited this response in an Australian Jewish News column, posing the question \\"IS Dvir Abramovich kidding? The question popped into my head while reading his thunderous attack on John Safran. For a moment, I wondered if Abramovich‚Äôs case against the Melbourne comic was, in fact, a satire of an outraged columnist\\".\\"http://www.polarisweb.com.au/clients/ajn/?p=10698 Published works Books  Chapters and articles  * References Category:1971 births Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Israeli emigrants to Australia Category:Australian people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Jewish Australian writers Category:Living people Category:Monash University alumni Category:University of Melbourne alumni Category:University of Melbourne faculty ","title":"Dvir Abramovich"},{"id":"33956980","text":"Ruislip High School is a secondary comprehensive school in Ruislip, within the London Borough of Hillingdon. The school opened to a single intake of Year 7 pupils in September 2006, and was officially opened in a ceremony in March 2007. The school's first GCSE results were released in August 2011, by which time the school had reached being five-form entry. History The process of planning for a new school began in January 2005 when a group of architects and designers were selected to form a design. Miller Construction Ltd was chosen in May of the same year to commence work on the site, which was required to prepare the greenfield land for the development. The school was designed by the architects Scott Brownrigg, using various methods to reduce the school's energy consumption. The school opened to a single intake of Year 7 pupils in September 2006, and was officially opened on 21 March 2007 with a ceremony including the burial of a time-capsule in the school grounds. Following the end of the 2010/11 academic year, the school's first headteacher, John Goulborn , announced his retirement. At the same time, the school received an \\"outstanding\\" rating from Ofsted, from an inspection carried out earlier in the year. This was the second time the school had been awarded the rating since opening. In August 2011, the school recorded 81% of students achieving at least five A* to C grades in their GCSEs, excluding English and Mathematics. This came from a total of 151 students entered into the examinations. Professor Heinz Wolff gave a speech at Ruislip High's first presentation evening, on 16 November 2011. Previously a community school administered by Hillingdon London Borough Council, Ruislip High School converted to academy status in April 2014. However the school continues to coordinate with Hillingdon London Borough Council for admissions. Appearance in The Inbetweeners Ruislip High represents the fictional school \\"Rudge Park Comprehensive\\" from The Inbetweeners television series and The Inbetweeners Movie, which began in 2008.

The body is white with colored points, recognized colors are black, blue, chocolate and lilac. They are one of the oldest and calmest breeds. Adult Himalayans weigh 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds (1 to 2 kg) with an ideal weight of 3 1/2 pounds. They are the only cylindrical rabbit breed. The history of the breed is partially a mystery, as there are no definite records that clearly state where the breed may have originated. Some speculate that their origin may be in the Far East as opposed to the Himalayas, as their name suggests. When Himalayans are raised in cold climates, they can exhibit black coloration of their coats, making them a phenocopy of the black rabbit. Himalayans are also known as the Chinese, Egyptian, and Black-nose.American Himalayan Rabbit Association They are posed stretched out, and their body is to be 3.5 head lengths.AHRA guidebook They have fine bone and a skinny body, and, unlike many other breeds, were never raised primarily for meat. This breed's main purpose is for show, but in its past, it was raised for its white pelt. Also, they are the only rabbit breed that commonly has an extra set of nipples. They are the ancestors of Californians, one of the most common meat rabbits. History Himalayan rabbits were one of the first breeds of rabbits, and their origin is unknown. It is unlikely that they came from the Himalayas though, as their name suggests. The original variety was the black Himalayan, and the blue Himalayan was created later. The chocolate and lilac varieties were made by different crosses depending on where they originated. American chocolate Himalayans were made by Ron Smelt of California by mixing chocolate English spots to Himalayans.American Himalayan Rabbit Association Breed History The lilacs were made by mixing the chocolate Himalayans the blues, but to create a color unique enough to get recognized as its own color (many early lilacs looked like light blues) lilac mini rexes were mixed in, but these lines were mostly destroyed after the color was accepted. The Himalayan plays an important part in many other breed's histories, especially the Californians,ARBA Guidebook: Raising Better Rabbits and Cavies which looks like a large, meaty version of it. The Californian was made by crossing Himalayans with New Zealand's and a few other breeds (some Californian breeders say it is just Himalayan and New Zealand, while others say the Standard Chinchilla was mixed in too). The Californian was added to many other breeds (like Champagne d'Argents and some lines of Cinnamon) to improve body type, so Himalayan marked sports pop up sometimes. In cold weather, it is common for Himalayan rabbits to grow darker hairs in the middle of a white section. This is known as \\"smut.\\" This rabbit is showing smut, which would disqualify it in a show. Photo by Liberty Acres Rabbitry. Markings The Himalayan rabbit is well known for its markings, which are similar to the Himalayan cats'. They have dark ears, front feet (socks), hind feet (boots), a dark tail, and a dark spot on nose (egg). The markings change with age and environment. The colder weather may darken markings, enlarge markings, and also add markings around the eyes and genitals (vent smut). These markings are not a disqualification because it is not on the usable portion of the pelt. If the markings spread into the usable portion of the pelt, such as into the belly or on the pin bones, it is a disqualification. Warmer weather may lighten markings, shrink markings, and cause white hairs in markings (known as \\"frosting\\"). In extreme warm weather, a Himalayan may even develop light or white toenails. Chocolate and lilac Himalayans usually have bigger markings than blacks and blues, and are more likely to develop disqualifying markings, known as \\"smut\\". Himalayans may develop smut after just ten minutes of contact to cold objects. Baby Himalayans are especially sensitive to temperature. Most babies in the warmth of the nest will look the same as albino babies (because Himalayans can only produce eumelanin under a certain temperature and they cannot produce pheomelanin at all.) Himalayans will always have red eyes, and any Himalayan marked rabbits without red eyes are usually misidentified sable points. If a nest gets too cold or a baby falls out, they will get dark bands on their fur. This varies from looking to off-white to looking chinchilla-colored, and it causes confusion among many novice breeders. Because of their constantly changing colors, most Himalayan breeders do not look at markings as a factor when making breeding plans. A baby who was chilled in the nest box is often called \\"frosty,\\" which is not to be confused with frosted pearl. The rabbit on the left fell out of the nest and was at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The one on the right was in its nest at about 95 degrees Fahrenheit Genetics Himalayans are known for having a double copy of the ch gene. They also have a black color, which is probably caused by a double copy of the a (self) gene. Then there are the variations with the B gene (chocolate) and the D gene (dilute). A Himalayan with bb will show up as chocolate, a Himalayan with dd will show up as blue and a Himalayan with both bb and dd will show up as lilac. The Himalayan gene (ch) has been bred into many other breeds, they lack marking modifiers so they often show up with smaller, lighter markings. Differences between other breeds * Himalayans are the only breed posed stretched out (cylindrical) * Himalayans are a common youth breed because of their good temperament * European Himalayans and American Himalayans have different poses. * Himalayans commonly have an extra set of teats.How many nipples do Himalayans have? * Himalayans are one of 4 breeds that can be moved up to senior class regardless of their weight.

The species is endemic to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Geographic range K. hirtipes is found in the United States in Texas, and it is also found in Mexico in the Mexican states: Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Mexico DF, Durango, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Mexico State, Michoac√°n, Morelos, and Zacatecas.  Diet  As omnivores, the diet of K. hirtipes primarily consists of vegetation and insects including filamentous algae, seeds and fruits, aquatic, terrestrial, flying arthropods, as well as aquatic gastropods. K. hirtipes undergoes a dietary shift from insects to vegetation as body size increases which facilitates rapid growth. Although male K. hirtipes are larger in size than females, both sexes share a dietary overlap consuming similar foods.  Predation  Based on tracks around kill sites, bite marks and shell damage it has been determined that the main predators of the K. hirtipes are racoons and feral pigs. Not surprisingly, both racoons and pigs are known to hunt several other species of turtle. These turtles seem to be relatively \\"immune\\" to predation but are at the highest risk when coming out of the water to nest.

Through this series of mergers, Gilweit and the Simmons' became the founders of the Carolina Actors Studio Theatre.

National Treasure (Japan) View of the \\"hare's fur\\" glazing effect on a Jian bowl Jian ware or Chien ware () is a type of Chinese pottery originally made in Jianyang, Fujian province. It, and local imitations of it, is known in Japan as Tenmoku (). The ware are simple shapes in stoneware, with a strong emphasis on subtle effects in the glazes. In the Song dynasty they achieved a high prestige, especially among Buddhist monks and in relation to tea-drinking. They were also highly valued in Japan, where many of the best examples were collected. Though the ceramic body is light-coloured, the wares, generally small cups for tea, bowls and vases, normally are glazed in dark colours, with special effects such as the \\"hare's fur\\" \\"oil-spot\\" and \\"partridge feather\\" patterns caused randomly as excess iron in the glaze is forced out during firing.  History  In Chinese it is called Jian zhan (), which translates as \\"Jian (tea)cup\\". The original kiln was called Jian Yao (). The original prefecture where it came from was then renamed into Jianzhou () in 621 CE during the Tang dynasty. The ware therefore became also known based on its origin as Jianzhou zhan (). The Song dynasty scholar and Fujian native Cai Xiang (1012‚Äì1067) noted in his \\"The Record of Tea\\": :: At the time, tea was prepared by whisking powdered leaves that had been pressed into dried cakes together with hot water, which was somewhat akin to matcha in the Japanese tea ceremony. The water added to this powder produced a white froth that would stand out better against a dark bowl. Jian ware reached the peak of its popularity during the Song dynasty. Vessels of this time were also greatly appreciated and copied in Japan, where they are known as tenmoku () wares. The Japanese term derives from Tianmu Mountain (), where this type of vessel was supposed to originate from and be appreciated. Five of these vessels that originate during the southern Song dynasty are so highly valued that they were included by the government in the list of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: others). Tastes in preparation changed during the Ming dynasty; the Hongwu Emperor (1328‚Äì1398) himself preferred leaves to powdered cakes, and would accept only leaf tea as tribute from tea-producing regions. Leaf tea, in contrast to powdered tea, was prepared by steeping whole leaves in boiling water - a process that led to the invention of the teapot and subsequent popularity of Yixing wares over the dark tea bowls.On shift from powdered to leaf tea and its accompanying accouterments, see Robert Mowry The Chinese Scholar's Studio: Artistic Life in the Late Ming period, ed. Chu-tsing Li et al., (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1987), p. 166; Timothy Brook, The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China, (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1998), p. 127; and James C.Y. Watt, \\"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\\" in Possessing the Past, p. 246. While in China the art of Jian ware faded and then died out, in Japan it continued and became the foremost producer of this type of ware, also due to the importance and development of the tea ceremony. Renewed interest in the history and cultural heritage in China has revived starting in the 1990s. At the Jiyufang Laolong site (), located in a village near the town of Shuiji not far from Wuyishan, Master Xiong Zhonggui has been able to restart production of Jian Zhan using original clay, after studying with Japanese maskers. Kilns in Dehua County are also attempting in recreating it. On 15 September 2016 a Song Jian ware tea-bowl of the yuteki tenmoku type, long in the Japanese Kuroda family collection, was auctioned at Christie's New York for over $US11 million. The pre-sale estimate was $US1.5 to 2.5 million. The bowl was registered by the Japanese government as an Important Art Object on 18 December 1935 and deregistered on 4 September 2015 for the sale.  Characteristics  The wares were made using local iron-rich clays and fired in an oxidising atmosphere at temperatures in the region of . The glaze was made using clay similar to that used for forming the body, except fluxed with wood-ash. They share some similarities with Jizhou ware, which developed around the same time. Many examples have distinct finishes in the glaze, which are much prized by collectors. The main three types of glaze patterns are: * \\"hare's fur\\" () * \\"tortoiseshell\\" () * \\"partridge feathers\\" () At high temperatures the molten glaze separates to produce the pattern called \\"hare's fur\\". When Jian wares were set tilted for firing, drips run down the side, creating pooling of the liquid glaze, which is retained after firing.

The \\"hare's fur\\" patterning in the glaze of this bowl resulted from the random effect of phase separation during early cooling in the kiln and is unique to this bowl. This phase separation in the iron-rich glazes of Chinese blackwares was also used to produce the well-known \\"oil- spot\\" (), \\"teadust\\" and \\"partridge-feather\\" () glaze effects. No two bowls have identical patterning. The bowl also has a dark brown \\"iron-foot\\" which is typical of this style. It would have been fired, probably with several thousand other pieces, each in its own stackable saggar, in a single-firing in a large dragon kiln. One such kiln, built on the side of a steep hill, was almost 150 metres in length, although most Jian dragon kilns were shorter than 100 metres. Revival The style of Jian ware has been much imitated over the last century, in Japan, the West, and recently also in China. Starting in the 1990s, the Ji Yu Fang Lao Long factory outside of Wuyishan, Fujian in the village of Shui Ji under Master Xiong has been able to restart production of Jian Zhan using the original raw materials. People in Dehua County are also attempting in recreating it.

He is currently the Music Director of both the Fort Wayne Philharmonic (appointed 2009) and the Reading Symphony Orchestra (appointed 2007). Early life Born in County Durham, England in 1961, Constantine began playing the cello at age eleven. At the age of sixteen, he went to a boarding school specialising in music ‚Äì the Wells Cathedral School in Somerset, England. From there, he studied further at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and later enrolled in the University of Leicester, where he studied conducting and began to perform as a conductor. He studied firstly with John Carewe and Norman Del Mar, then later with Ferdinand Leitner at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena and Leonard Bernstein at the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival. After winning the first Donatella Flick Conducting Competition, Constantine went to Russia's Leningrad Conservatory for a year of study with the then 90-year-old Ilya Musin. A conductor, teacher and theorist of conducting, Musin taught at the Conservatory for six decades, and his book, \\"The Techniques of Conducting,\\" has been followed worldwide Career The Bardi Symphony Orchestra In 1986, Constantine began his rise as a conductor in a most unusual way. Bringing together many musicians from a range of different backgrounds (who, though they had studied music to the highest levels, pursued careers outside of music) in and around the Leicestershire (UK) area, Constantine founded the Bardi Symphony Orchestra. A professional orchestra still with its current home in Leicester at De Montfort Hall, the Bardi is associated with performers from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and the CBSO. At the same time, Constantine worked regularly with nearly all of the finest British orchestras mentioned previously as well as having strong relationships with a number of European and Scandinavian orchestras including the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, where he has worked frequently as a guest conductor. After winning the first Donatella Flick/ Accademia Italiana Conducting Competition Andrew Constantine made his Royal Festival Hall debut with the London Philharmonic. In 2003 he was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Music by the University of Leicester, for this \\"contribution to music\\", and also a prestigious British NESTA Fellowship to further develop his international career. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra Having gained a reputation in Europe and the UK as a conductor of great skill, charisma, energy and versatility, Andrew Constantine moved to the US in 2004 to become Assistant Conductor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Constantine has always had a love of Russian conductors, and because Yuri Temirkanov was conductor of the Baltimore Symphony at that time, it was an opportunity he gladly seized. He knew of Temirkanov's sterling reputation as a guest conductor for the leading orchestras of Europe, Asia and the United States and of his longtime position as Music Director and Chief Conductor of the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia. Within Constantine's first season in Baltimore, he was promoted to Associate Conductor, consistently working many of the orchestra's main concerts whilst stressing the importance of educational concerts which he himself took charge of as well. As he states, \\"I really see the education concerts as the future of this whole business. It's all about how to get enough kids through the door, and literally leave no child behind. This is where we should be investing our enthusiasm\\". The Reading Symphony Orchestra In May 2007, following a two-year search and a pool of over 280 applicants, Constantine made the step up and was appointed Music Director of the Reading Symphony Orchestra in Reading, Pennsylvania, with an opening season that brought critical and box office acclaim. In just his first concert with the orchestra, the Reading Eagle praised his \\"attention to detail\\" further stating that \\"the musicians' response to Constantine's faultless direction, made this a thoroughly captivating performance\\" . More recently Constantine has gained further praise for his consistently creative and compelling programming over the seasons in Reading, and won much acclaim with the orchestra for the RSO's Star Spangled Spectacular on 4 July 2011. The concert served one of its main purposes attracting new audiences to the symphonic repertoire, as Constantine is always seeking to do, with a traditionally patriotic program and a fabulous fireworks show to end at FirstEnergy Stadium in front of a sellout crowd. The Fort Wayne Philharmonic In July 2009, following a similar search to that in Reading, Constantine was also appointed Music Director of the Fort Wayne Philharmonic in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Constantine was one of eight finalists for the philharmonic job and one of about 275 applicants, the Philharmonic said. The orchestra board of directors chose him based on input from the search committee, staff, board members, musicians and audience, orchestra officials said, in a unanimous decision . Constantine continues to bring a fresh aspect to the programming aspect of being a music director in Fort Wayne. With the Signature Series, Constantine set out to break down the resistance to classical music. Constantine said that he is striving to make the orchestra relevant to as many people as possible. Along the same wavelength, he introduced to The Phil's 2011‚Äì2012 season an \\"audience choice\\" concert, where fans of the orchestra were able to vote online for which composers and pieces they wished to hear. As he has said himself, \\"No two people have the same experience of classical music. Our interpretation draws on personal insights, memories and feelings. The challenge is to persuade more people to go to concerts and discover this for themselves\\". Due to its popularity, Constantine decided to repeat the audience choice program for the 2012‚Äì13 season. That season was also unique for including at least one modern work in each of the regular concerts. Discography Constantine has recorded extensively throughout his conducting career. Early releases include Spanish Masterworks for the Guitar with Virginia Luque and the London Symphony Orchestra and Clarinet Concertos with Steven Kanoff and the Munich Radio Orchestra. In 1995, he recorded Brahms: Double Concerto / Schumann: Cello Concerto In A Minor with Maria Kliegel, Ilya Kaler, and the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland on Naxos Records. More recent records include Walter Bricht on Toccata Classics, which explores the music of the Jewish composer who fled Vienna to teach at Indiana University in Bloomington, and ELGAR: THE NEW ENGLAND CONNECTION on Orchid Classics, which studies the connections between composers Edward Elgar and George Chadwick. Praise Constantine has been described by Classic FM (the UK's largest radio station) as \\"a Rising Star of Classical Music\\". In the US he has won great praise for his ability to communicate with audiences and his energetic and compelling advocacy for classical music have gained him many admirers. Both his compatriots and critics have had nothing but good to say of the English-born conductor: * ‚Äúthe real thing, a serious conductor‚Äù ‚Äì Yuri Temirkanov * ‚Äúa conductor of immense capabilities‚Äù ‚Äì Yan Pascal Tortelier * ‚Äúa brilliant representative of the art of conducting‚Äù ‚Äì Ilya Musin * ‚ÄúThe poise and hushed beauty of the London Philharmonic‚Äôs playing was one of the most remarkable qualities of Constantine‚Äôs direction. He has an exceptional gift for holding players and listeners on a thread of sound, drawing out the most refined textures.‚Äù ‚Äì Edward Greenfield, The London Times * ‚ÄúDefiniteness of intention is a great thing, and Constantine‚Äôs shaping of the music was never short of it‚Äù ‚Äì Financial Times * ‚ÄúAndrew Constantine showed a capacity RFH audience just what he is made of, ending his big demanding programme with an electrifying performance of Prokofiev‚Äôs Symphony No. 5.‚Äù ‚Äì The Independent Personal life Though working in both Reading, PA, and Fort Wayne, IN, Constantine still resides where he began his career in the US in Baltimore, MD. He lives there with his wife Jane, and their two children Michael and Rosie.

Released in 2007, the application was originally only for desktop and laptop computers, and is now available for macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Kobo eReaders, and web browsers. Pocket was taken over by Mozilla, the developers of the Firefox web browser, in 2017. Functions The application allows the user to save an article or web page to remote servers for later reading. The article is then sent to the user's Pocket list (synced to all of their devices) for offline reading. Pocket removes clutter from articles, and allows the user to add tags to their articles and to adjust text settings for easier reading. History Pocket was introduced in August 2007 as a Mozilla Firefox browser extension named Read It Later by Nathan (Nate) Weiner. Once his product was used by millions of people, he moved his office to Silicon Valley and four other people joined the Read It Later team. Weiner's intention was to have the application be like a TiVo for web content and giving users access to that content on any device. Read It Later obtained venture capital investments of US$2.5 million in 2011 and $5.0 million in 2012. The 2011 funding came from Foundation Capital, Baseline Ventures, Google Ventures, Founder Collective and unnamed angel investors. The company rejected an acquisition offer by Evernote after showing concerns that Evernote intended to shut down the Read It Later service and amalgamate its functionality into Evernote's main service. Initially the Read It Later app was available in a free version and a paid version that included additional features. After the rebranding to Pocket, all paid features were made available in a free and advertisement-free app. In May 2014, a paid subscription service called Pocket Premium was introduced, adding server-side storage of articles and more powerful search tools. In June 2015, Pocket integration was added as a default feature to the Mozilla Firefox web browser, via a toolbar button and link to a user's Pocket list in the bookmarks menu. The integration was controversial, as users displayed concerns for the direct integration of a proprietary service into an open source application, and that it could not be completely disabled without editing advanced settings, unlike third-party extensions. A Mozilla spokesperson stated that the feature was meant to leverage the service's popularity among Firefox users and clarified that all code related to the integration was open source. The spokesperson added that \\"[Mozilla had] gotten lots of positive feedback about the integration from users\\". On February 27, 2017, Pocket announced that it had been acquired by Mozilla Corporation, the commercial arm of Firefox's non-profit development group. Mozilla staff stated that Pocket would continue to operate as an independent subsidiary but that it would be leveraged as part of an ongoing \\"Context Graph\\" project. There are plans to open-source the server-side code of Pocket, but that has yet to materialize as of June 2020. Userbase The application had 17 million users and 1 billion saves, as of September 2015. Some applications, such as Flipboard, Google Currents, and Twitter use Pocket's API. Pocket was listed among TIMEs 50 Best Android Applications for 2013. Reception Kent German of CNET said that \\"Read It Later is oh so incredibly useful for saving all the articles and news stories I find while commuting or waiting in line.\\" Erez Zukerman of PC World said that supporting the developer is enough reason to buy what he deemed a \\"handy app\\". Bill Barol of Forbes said that although Read It Later works less well than Instapaper, \\"it makes my beloved Instapaper look and feel a little stodgy.\\" In 2015, Pocket was awarded a Material Design Award for Adaptive Layout by Google for their Android application.

Overview Semiotics in popular music, or mesomusica, is different from semiotics in other musical forms, because pop music denotes a cultural object (Matusitz, 2004). Popular music has many signs in itself because it has many components and uses, but it also appeals to the emotions of a generation. Music is the ‚Äúlogical expression‚Äù of feelings, a \\"symbolic form\\". Music videos are an example of syntagm, which interacting signifiers form a meaningful whole. Music videos are also considered multimodal genres because one semiotic system is joined syntagmatically to another semiotic system, which results in a signified indexical meaning. The process of music correlated with visuals can be described in terms of two basic mechanisms: temporal synchronicity and cross-modal homology. Incorporating the two modalities, sound and image, we can interpret it as a unified syntagm. Music videos are known to be visually secondary signified in combination with the semantic content of the lyrics. Semiotics in music videos is different from a pragmatic analysis because we can uphold that semiotics searches for meaning by considering sign production and progress, while pragmatics searches for meaning by considering the intentions of semantics and the context it has evolved in. There are early critics of the importance of analyzing music videos as a semiotic system. Frederic Jameson's definition of music videos is a schizophrenic string of isolated, discontinued signifiers, failing to link up into a coherent sequence, as a string without a center. Invisible editing Many semiotic analysts have examined music videos to decode messages that are being sent to viewers. Invisible editing, a semiotic term, that film editors use to almost decode the message for the audience using narrative actions. Daniel Chandler's example from famous film editor, Ralph Rosenblum, \\"a man awakens suddenly in the middle of the night, bolts up in bed, stares ahead intensely, and twitches his nose. Then the film directs towards a room where two people are desperately fighting a billowing blaze\\"(Chandler, pp. 166, 2007). Because of the actions of the actors, the audience is aware of the next scene before it is shown. An example of invisible editing in music videos would be in narrative style, which consist of a plot and storyline of events and characters Michael Jackson's music video, Thriller is considered a narrative script, and it exceeds the song itself. In this case, the context of visual narrative semantically over-powers the meaning of the song itself. Many music videos use narrative style script, which is considered a more formal approach as the editing will add emphasis to the song's chorus, giving it a deeply ingrained musical archetype. Music videos that aren't formally organized usually have no segmentation markings that flow with the lyrics, and contain abstract images. Sledgehammer, by Peter Gabriel is an example of formally unorganized music videos. In general, music videos contain visuals that either represent the potential connotative meaning of the lyrics or the visuals can represent a semiotic system of its own. Although many analysts explain the music video as being a narrative structure, there are many videos that defy narrative conventions. Intertextuality Intertextuality, for media purposes, references other popular culture objects within their video, and then the audience creates their meaning of the video according to the intentional suggestion created with relationships between primary and secondary texts. In general terms, intertextuality is considered links within a context or medium that bind text to other text (Chandler, pp. 166, 2007 ). Many editors and directors use intertextuality in music videos because it combines different cultural codes taken from previous texts that are sensible for many audiences. Using intertextuality in music videos allow a viewer to identify with their theoretical framework of knowledge, and use it to define their identity. This approach can be used to gain popularity for referenced ideas, and influence consumers with a persuasive agenda. Material Girl, by Madonna is an example of using intertextuality because she is acting like Marilyn Monroe in Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend. This is a direct cinematic reference which allows an active audience to draw conclusions to the meaning of the message. Intratextuality Intratextuality is a term that is derived from intertextuality, but is considered combining secondary references for marketing and promotional purposes. This type of technique is also called anchorage, found by Roland Barthes: anchoring text to a context that changes the intentional meaning. An example of this would be, the music video, Right Now, by Van Halen. The lyrics of the song Right Now suggest an entirely different meaning than the social empowering messages shown through the music video. Bricolage Bricolage is also an example of using many different texts within a context for promotional, marketing, or popularity value. Lady Gaga uses cultural bricolage in her music videos by using fashion and previous memorable characteristics of former pop stars. Michael Jackson's Leave Me Alone is also a form of bricolage because it is a collage of already popular people and pop culture artifacts combined to portray his own message.

History On 14 November 2008, Dreamworld announced V8 Supercars RedLine on Australian theme park forum, Parkz. This was followed shortly by the launch of a construction blog at . Construction of the ride began shortly after the ride's announcement. An existing shed, originally used as part of the Cyclone's theming, was modified and extended to become the home of V8 Supercars RedLine. The ride was originally scheduled to open on 16 December 2008, however, a number of reasons forced it to be delayed. V8 Supercars RedLine had a soft opening on 26 December 2008. The ride was officially opened on 18 February 2009 with V8 Supercar drivers Cameron McConville, Craig Lowndes, Greg Murphy and Jamie Whincup present for the launch. Operation Guests enter the V8 Supercars RedLine building which is located adjacent to the FlowRider and the Cyclone at the southern end of Ocean Parade. Riders must pre-book their session at the booking counter. When it is their session riders will receive a briefing on how to drive the cars as well as a safety spiel. During normal park operating hours, drivers are required to pay $10 to experience V8 Supercars RedLine. Guests who don't want to drive but still want to experience the ride can purchase a passenger pass for $5. For these prices they get to experience the ride for 7 minutes. On selected Friday nights, Dreamworld operate V8 Supercars RedLine as NightDriver. For a $20 fee, drivers can have a 30-minute session. Spectators can watch the session for $5. Cars V8 Supercars RedLine originally featured 4 replica V8 Supercars. The cars were modeled on those of Craig Lowndes, Greg Murphy, Mark Winterbottom and Cameron McConville in the 2008 V8 Supercars series, with each car fitted with a collision detection system. This translates into mechanical movements. Screens covering 180¬∞ vision surround each of the cars. The cars also feature a rear-vision camera. During its latest renovation, the replica cars were ditched in favour of a modern, top of the line Vesaro motion simulator, with upgrades to a sequential gearbox as well as the display screens. The latest iteration features the supported latest rFactor 2 software, to offer a much more dynamic driving experience compared to the older physics simulator.

The junction of these two rivers could be seen from the site. This site was first visited by Marshall Williams in 1968 at the suggestion of the site‚Äôs landowner, Joe Bell, who had discovered various artifacts while the site was being regularly plowed. Because of Interstate construction, Marshall Williams and Mark Williams discovered this site during surface surveys and excavations of the plowed areas. The site was excavated and analyzed by Mark Williams as part of his PhD dissertation. During the 1969 excavations, four areas within the site were designated for excavation. In Areas 1-3 various five foot square units were excavated. No excavations were done in Area 4 in 1969. Large quantities of small potsherds were discovered during these excavations, and they ranged from the Duvall Phase in Area 1 to Bell Phase in Areas 2-4. As part of the 1969 excavations, a road grading machine took off the topsoil of twelve strips on the site. This uncovered Features 1 and 2, and they were completely excavated. In 1977, the site was revisited by Marshall Williams and Mark Williams. Since various plans threatened this site, major excavations took place from June 15, 1977 until September 16, 1977 by Mark Williams. Most of the work centered on Area 2 or the Bell Phase portion of the site. The Bell Phase portion of this site was probably no more the . Because of time constraints, only 17 of 55 features were excavated, and no more than a handful of the 1100 posts were excavated. A few trips were made back to the site the following year with the help of volunteers, and approximately 80% of the area stripped by heavy machinery was mapped. Some of the features were trash features that consisted of a circular pit filled with food residues and pottery sherds. Evidence of a large circular structure or rotunda was found at the site. It was the social, political, and religious center for the inhabitants. A large quantity of the features was small, circular, semi- subterranean structures that were probably used as sleeping quarters on cold nights. Another structure found was warm weather structures. One major trash feature was found that had been deposited in a single episode and was burned during or after deposition. Numerous sherds were found in this pit, and many reconstructable vessels were present. Ethnohistoric literature of the Southeast suggests that this feature was formed during a Busk or Green Corn ceremony. The ceremony has been described as the physical cleansing of the town.Williams, John Mark. The Joe Bell Site: Seventeenth Century Lifeways on the Oconee River. Diss.

Unveiled on October 19, 2011, Android 4.0 builds upon the significant changes made by the tablet-only release Android Honeycomb, in an effort to create a unified platform for both smartphones and tablets. Android 4.0 was focused on simplifying and modernizing the overall Android experience around a new set of human interface guidelines. As part of these efforts, it introduced a new visual appearance codenamed \\"Holo\\", which is built around a cleaner, minimalist design, and a new default typeface named Roboto. It also introduced a number of other new features, including a refreshed home screen, near-field communication (NFC) support and the ability to \\"beam\\" content to another user using the technology, an updated web browser, a new contacts manager with social network integration, the ability to access the camera and control music playback from the lock screen, visual voicemail support, face recognition for device unlocking (\\"Face Unlock\\"), the ability to monitor and limit mobile data usage, and other internal improvements. Android 4.0 received positive reviews by critics, who praised the cleaner, revamped appearance of the operating system in comparison to previous versions, along with its improved performance and functionality. However, critics still felt that some of Android 4.0's stock apps were still lacking in quality and functionality in comparison to third- party equivalents, and regarded some of the operating system's new features, particularly the \\"face unlock\\" feature, as being gimmicks. , statistics issued by Google indicate that 0.3% of all Android devices accessing Google Play run Ice Cream Sandwich.  Development  Following the tablet-only release \\"Honeycomb\\", it was announced at Google I/O 2011 that the next version of Android, code named \\"Ice Cream Sandwich\\" (ICS), would be emphasized providing a unified user experience between both smartphones and tablets. In June 2011, details also began to surface surrounding a then-new Nexus phone by Samsung to accompany ICS, which would notably exclude hardware navigation keys. Android blog RootzWiki released photos in August 2011 showing a Nexus S running a build of ICS, depicting a new application menu layout resembling that of Honeycomb, and a new interface with blue-colored accenting. An official launch event for Android 4.0 and the new Nexus phone was originally scheduled for October 11, 2011, at a CTIA trade show in San Diego. However, out of respect for the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Google and Samsung postponed the event to October 19, 2011, in Hong Kong. Android 4.0 and its launch device, the Galaxy Nexus, were officially unveiled on October 19, 2011. Andy Rubin explained that 4.0 was intended to provide a \\"enticing and intuitive\\" user experience across both smartphones and tablets. Matias Duarte, Google's vice president of design, explained that development of Ice Cream Sandwich was based around the question \\"What is the soul of the new machine?\\"; user studies concluded that the existing Android interface was too complicated, and thus prevented users from being \\"empowered\\" by their devices. The overall visual appearance of Android was streamlined for Ice Cream Sandwich, building upon the changes made on the tablet-oriented Android 3.0, his first project at Google; Duarte admitted that his team had cut back support for smaller screens on Honeycomb to prioritize sufficient tablet support, as he wanted Android OEMs to \\"stop doing silly things like taking a phone UI and stretching it out to a 10-inch tablet.\\" Judging Android's major competitors, Duarte felt that the interface of iOS was too skeuomorphic and kitschy, Windows Phone's Metro design language looked too much like \\"airport lavatory signage\\", and that both operating systems tried too hard to enforce conformity, \\"[without] leaving any room for the content to express itself.\\" For Ice Cream Sandwich, his team aimed to provide interface design guidelines which would evoke a modern appearance, while still allowing flexibility for application developers. He characterized the revised look of Ice Cream Sandwich as having \\"toned down the geeky nerd quotient\\" in comparison to Honeycomb, which carried a more futuristic appearance that was compared by critics to the aesthetics of Tron. In January 2012, following the official launch of Ice Cream Sandwich, Duarte and Google launched an Android Design portal, which features human interface guidelines, best practices, and other resources for developers building Android apps designed for Ice Cream Sandwich.  Release  The Galaxy Nexus was the first Android device to ship with Android 4.0. Android 4.0.3 was released on December 16, 2011, providing bug fixes, a new social stream API, and other internal improvements.\\"Android 4.0.3 Platform and Updated SDK tools\\". Android Developers Blog. December 16, 2011. Retrieved January 4, 2012. The same day, Google began a rollout of Ice Cream Sandwich to the predecessor of the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus S. However, on December 20, 2011, the Nexus S roll-out was \\"paused\\" so the company could \\"monitor feedback\\" related to the update. On March 29, 2012, Android 4.0.4 was released, promising performance improvements to the camera and screen rotation, and other bug fixes.\\"Google announces Android 4.0.4\\". The Inquirer. March 29, 2012. Retrieved March 31, 2012. Google Play Services support for 4.0 ended in February 2019.  Features   Visual design  The user interface of Android4.0 represents an evolution of the design introduced by Honeycomb, although the futuristic aesthetics of Honeycomb were scaled back in favor of flat design with neon blue accenting, hard edges, and drop shadows for depth. Ice Cream Sandwich also introduced a new default system font, Roboto; designed in-house to replace the Droid font family, Roboto is primarily optimized for use on high- resolution mobile displays. The new visual appearance of Ice Cream Sandwich is implemented by a widget toolkit known as \\"Holo\\"; to ensure access to the Holo style across all devices‚Äîeven if they use a customized interface skin elsewhere, all Android devices certified to ship with Google Play Store (formerly Android Market) must provide the capability for apps to use the unmodified Holo theme. As with Honeycomb, devices can render navigation buttons‚Äî\\"Back\\", \\"Home\\", and \\"Recent apps\\"‚Äîon a \\"system bar\\" across the bottom of the screen, removing the need for physical equivalents. The \\"Menu\\" button that was present on previous generations of Android devices is deprecated, in favor of presenting buttons for actions within apps on \\"action bars\\", and menu items which do not fit on the bar in \\"action overflow\\" menus, designated by three vertical dots. Hardware \\"Search\\" buttons are also deprecated, in favor of search buttons within action bars. On devices without a \\"Menu\\" key, a temporary \\"Menu\\" key is displayed on-screen while running apps that are not coded to support the new navigation scheme. On devices that use a hardware \\"Menu\\" key, action overflow buttons are hidden in apps and are mapped to the \\"Menu\\" key.  User experience  The default home screen of Ice Cream Sandwich displays a persistent Google Search bar across the top of the screen, a dock across the bottom containing the app drawer button in the middle, and four slots for app shortcuts alongside it. Folders of apps can be formed by dragging an app and hovering it over another. The app drawer is split into two tabs; one for apps, and the latter holding widgets to be placed on home screen pages. Widgets themselves can be resizable and contain scrolling content. Android4.0 contains an increased use of swiping gestures; apps and notifications can now be removed from the recent apps menu and dismissed from the notifications area by sliding them away, and a number of stock and Google apps now use a new form of tabs, in which users can navigate between different panes by either tapping their name on a strip, or swiping left and right. The phone app was updated with a Holo design, the ability to send pre-configured text message responses in response to incoming calls, and visual voicemail integration within the call log display. The web browser app incorporates updated versions of WebKit and V8, supports syncing with Google Chrome, has an override mode for loading a desktop-oriented version of a website rather than a mobile-oriented version, as well as offline browsing. The \\"Contacts\\" section of the phone app was split off into a new \\"People\\" app, which offers integration with social networks such as Google+ to display recent posts and synchronize contacts, and a \\"Me\\" profile for the device's user. The camera app was redesigned, with a reduction in shutter lag, face detection, a new panorama mode, and the ability to take still photos from a video being recorded in camcorder mode. The photo gallery app now contains basic photo editing tools. The lock screen now supports \\"Face Unlock\\", includes a shortcut for launching the camera app, and can house playback controls for music players. The keyboard incorporates improved autocomplete algorithms, and improvements to voice input allow for continuous dictation. The ability to take screenshots by holding down the power and \\"Volume down\\" buttons together was also added. On devices supporting near-field communication (NFC), \\"Android Beam\\" allows users to share links to content from compatible apps by holding the back of their device up against the back of another NFC-equipped Android device, and tapping the screen when prompted. Certain \\"System\\" apps (particularly those pre-loaded by carriers) that cannot be uninstalled can now be disabled. This hides the application and prevents it from launching, but the application is not removed from storage. Android4.0 introduced features for managing data usage over mobile networks; users can display the total amount of data they have used over a period of time, and display data usage per app. Background data usage can be disabled globally or on a per-app basis, and a cap can be set to automatically disable data if usage reaches a certain quota as calculated by the device.  Platform  Android 4.0 inherits platform additions from Honeycomb, and also adds support for ambient temperature and humidity sensors, Bluetooth Health Device Profile, near-field communication (NFC), and Wi-Fi Direct. The operating system also provides improved support for stylus and mouse input, along with new accessibility, calendar, keychain, spell checking, social networking, and virtual private network APIs. For multimedia support, Android4.0 also adds support for ADTS AAC, Matroska containers for Vorbis and VP8, WebP, streaming of VP8, OpenMAX AL, and HTTP Live Streaming 3.0.  Reception  Android4.0 was released to positive reception: Ars Technica praised the Holo user interface for having a \\"sense of identity and visual coherence that were previously lacking\\" in comparison to previous versions of Android, also believing that the new interface style could help improve the quality of third-party apps. The stock apps of Android4.0 were also praised for having slightly better functionality in comparison to previous versions. Other features were noted, such as the improvements to text and voice input, along with the data usage controls (especially given the increasing use of metered data plans), and its overall performance improvements in comparison to Gingerbread. However, the Face Unlock feature was panned for being an insecure gimmick, and although providing an improved experience over the previous version, some of its stock applications (such as its email client) were panned for still being inferior to third-party alternatives. Engadget also acknowledged the maturing quality of the Android experience on Ice Cream Sandwich, and praised the modern feel of its new interface in comparison to Android 2.3, along with some of the new features provided by Google's stock apps and the operating system itself. In conclusion, Engadget felt that Android4.0 was \\"a gorgeous OS that offers great performance and‚Äîfor the most part‚Äîdoesn't feel like a half-baked effort.\\" However, Engadget still felt that some of Android4.0's new features (such as Face Unlock) had a \\"beta feel\\" to them, noted the lack of Facebook integration with the new People app, and that the operating system was still not as intuitive for new users as its competitors. PC Magazine acknowledged influence from Windows Phone 7 in the new \\"People\\" app and improved benchmark performance on the web browser, but considered both Android Beam and Face Unlock to be gimmicks, and criticized the lack of support for certain apps and Adobe Flash on launch.

The third son of Walter Rye, the athlete and antiquary, and Georgina Eliza Rye of Norwich, he was educated at Fauconberg Grammar School, Beccles and St Paul's School, London. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1901, and joined his father's legal firm. The company was largely involved in conveyancing, Rye eventually became the senior partner, and he built up a lucrative practice transferring freehold and leasehold property in the Soho area of central London. He entered local politics as an alderman on Westminster City Council, and was mayor of the city in 1922‚Äì1923. He was appointed by the city council to the Metropolitan Water Board and the Thames Conservancy. At the 1923 general election he was the Conservative Party candidate for the constituency of Loughborough in Leicestershire, but failed to be elected. When another election was held in 1924 he was elected to the House of Commons as Loughborough's member of parliament, with the sitting Liberal Party MP, Edward Spears being beaten into third place behind George Winterton of the Labour Party. Rye served only one term in parliament, and was defeated in 1929 when Winterton, his Labour opponent of five years before, won the seat. In 1931 he was chosen by the Conservatives to contest Walsall. In the event the party did not contest the seat, instead supporting the Liberal candidate as the representative of the National Government. In 1937 he was elected to the London County Council as a Municipal Reform Party councillor representing Westminster, Abbey. He remained a member of the county council until his death, and served as deputy chairman in 1946‚Äì1947. He was created an OBE in 1937 and CBE in 1945.

It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2004. It is considered the longest used schoolhouse in Arizona, having been in operation for over eighty years. Due to its physical mass and prominent hillside location, it is \\"the most visible and identifiable building\\" in the small unincorporated town and the town's largest building. It was designed by architect W.S. Elliott and constructed by Prescott, Arizona contractor Joe Petit for $9,000 to $10,000 on land donated by the town's founder, Joe Mayer. Since its completion in 1915, it was continuously used as a school, except for 1982‚Äì1987, until 2002 when it was condemned by the fire marshal. It became a fully accredited high school in the 1930s with the installation of indoor plumbing. It was not used as a high school after 1981. Elementary students continued to attend from 1988 to 2002. When constructed, the building faced the town's main street (called Main Street) but the street was later moved to the rear of the building. It also faced the tracks of the Prescott and Eastern Railroad until they were removed in 1949. After a historic restoration in the early 2000s, the building is now used for Mayer Unified School District administrative offices and as a Sheriff's substation. Characteristics The building is a typical school building of the era in which it was built. It has a hipped roof and concrete foundation with walls at least thick, many windows, and a bell tower on the roof. It has a prominent entrance on the north side featuring double doors with sidelights and a transom in an elaborate arched opening. Exterior walls are red brick, hence the name Red Brick Schoolhouse. The interior has maple- strip flooring and an oak staircase. History School enrollment increased rapidly in the early 1910s, prompting the Yavapai County Superintendent of Schools to conclude that the existing school was overcrowded and a larger school building was needed. The citizens passed a municipal bond to pay for a new school. The new school was to be located on the site of the existing school, the hilltop location previously donated by Joe Mayer. This necessitated the moving of the existing wooden school. Construction of the new building began in 1914 and was completed the next year. The bricks used were made in Mayer. The building had coal-fired heating, a ventilation system, electric lights, and initially served eighty students in four classrooms. Three classrooms taught students in two or three grades and the fourth was for high school students (grades nine and ten initially and nine to twelve beginning in the 1930s). The first high school graduation took place on May 19, 1933, with two graduates. The 1930s brought the addition of an outdoor basketball court built by the Yavapai County highway department and saw the building used for town entertainment as weekly movies were shown in the large second floor. Lunchroom Local legend states that the building originally had no basement until local hard rock miners excavated under the completed building. They were motivated to do this in order to provide space for the students to eat as there was no other space for a lunchroom and the community had no funds for expansion. Their volunteer effort, thought impossible by some, was done over several months when they were not at work in the local mines. Restoration In the 1990s, the school district decided the building was no longer suitable for use as a school. Partial remodeling done in 1987 did not overcome original design issues, and further modernizing was not considered financially viable. The school district initiated the process for listing the building by commissioning an assessment by architects Gerald A. Doyle & Associates. Their report concluded the building was no longer \\"ideal\\" for use as a school but had \\"significant architectural and historical significance\\". The report documented original features including floors, stairs, brickwork, window and door frames, ceilings, interior walls, chair rails, picture moldings, slate chalkboards, light fixtures, and the school bell. Restoration of these features was estimated to cost $411,000. In December 2000, the school district received funding from the Arizona School Facilities Board to construct additional elementary classroom space allowing the relocation of the remaining elementary classes from the Red Brick Schoolhouse. The district approved the renovation plan in February 2003 and began interior renovation later that year. The project architect was Swan Architects of Phoenix. Historic renovation was funded by a federal emergency repair and renovation grant from the United States Department of Education, state grants, and private donations. The building was converted for administrative use, with historic displays and the original school bell remaining. A 2003 $22,000 grant from the State Historic Preservation Office funded replacement of the roof and repair of the chimney and windows. This phase of the restoration, which was delayed due to the discovery of asbestos and the difficulty in finding historically accurate bricks to repair the chimney, was completed in 2005. The renovation was delayed when the building was officially recognized as historic. Renovation plans were updated since some current building codes were no longer applicable to a historic structure. On June 30, 2005 a plaque was unveiled to commemorate the listing of the schoolhouse on the NRHP. The plaque is located in the first floor entryway due to fear of vandalism if it were on the outside of the structure. Restoration work was funded by state and federal grants totaling over $200,000 received by the district in the early 2000s. In 2008, restoration of the exterior, funded in part by a Heritage Park Restoration grant, was completed. Current usage Building in 2018 In 2013 the ground floor was leased for $1000 per month for five years to the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office as the Mayer substation. All school district offices were relocated to the second floor. The Sheriff's substation opened in June 2014.

Fire department 48-hour protest The Hong Kong Fire Services Department have long protested for having to work far too many hours. Thousands of firefighters held a protest at Southorn Playground after the fire. According to the department's statement, not only is their job dangerous, but each week they have to work 54 hours. This has been unfair compared to other disciplinary government departments who are limited to 48. They have held a 48-hour protest to ask the government to reduce the working hours to 48 or 44 hrs a week. The government earlier wanted the fire department to cut hours in exchange for cutting wages, but this has not been acceptable to the fire department. The department has said this Mongkok fire proved the department should never be shorthanded. Aftermath Two suspects are wanted by the police. There has been comparisons made that since the 1997 handover, only two fire incidents have exceeded this. The 1996 Garley Building fire and the January 1997 arson attack on Top One Karaoke in Tsim Sha Tsui in which 17 died and 13 were injured.

He subsequently returned to South Africa to run a weekly newspaper, Life, Sports and Drama (LSD) and expanded his business to Portuguese East Africa. He was elected to Johannesburg Municipal Council in 1919 and was acquitted of bribery accusations later that year. Naylor sojourned in India before returning to Sydney in 1925.

The ensemble cast, who donated their services, includes some of South Korea's leading actors.  Plot  The plot draws on No Gun Ri victims' experiences, but the characters are all fictional. The film opens with scenes establishing the ordinary domestic rhythms of a midcentury Korean village, with children at play, men relaxing over a board game, and a young teacher leading her pupils in practice for a singing contest. But the fighting front of the war, which began several weeks earlier, soon intrudes as combat moves south. The United States has hastily dispatched insufficiently trained troops from Japan to join the South Korean army in defending against North Korean invaders. As the defenders reel in retreat, American soldiers order the villagers to abandon their homes and head south. Some 500 begin the trek, with children on their backs and carts laden with belongings. Rumors have spread among American soldiers that North Korean infiltrators are disguised among South Korean refugees. As the villagers struggle southward along a railroad track, they are suddenly attacked by American warplanes. Many are killed. In the ensuing chaos, U.S. soldiers force hundreds of survivors into the underpass of a railroad bridge, and receive orders to fire on them, despite one soldier's communication to his superiors that they are only civilians. Over the next three days, in heart-wrenching scenes of carnage, most of the refugees are killed. The few survivors, mostly children, emerge from under piles of bodies as the Americans retreat and advancing North Korean soldiers discover the gruesome scene. (Survivors estimated 400 people were killed.) A depiction of the scene under the No Gun Ri bridge. The U.S. military killed a large number of South Korean refugees under and around the bridge in July 1950. In the denouement, survivors and villagers who were never trapped under the bridge return to their homes as the tides of war ebb and flow. One of the last is a boy, assumed dead by his mother, who has carried his small sister on his back for miles from their southern refuge. As the credits roll, A Little Pond ends with a kind of dream sequence in which children and villagers brought back to life sing and applaud the contest theme song they never performed.  Production  After reading the 2003 Korean translation of The Bridge at No Gun Ri, (Korean translation: Ingle Publishing Company, Seoul, 2003, ) a book by Charles J. Hanley, Sang-Hun Choe and Martha Mendoza, Associated Press journalists who confirmed the massacre, executive producer Lee Eun of Myung Films was determined to tell the story on the screen. Additional background came from Do You Know Our Sorrow?, a 1994 Korean-language book by Chung Eun- yong, whose two children were killed at No Gun Ri. Noted theater director Lee Saang-woo joined the project, directing his first film. He and producer Lee Woo-jung spent three years collecting material through interviews with No Gun Ri survivors and other sources. Lee Eun formed an autonomous unit, Nogunri Production, in May 2006 to produce the movie, and the team recruited such leading actors as Song Kang-ho (of Thirst and The Host) and Moon So-ri (Oasis and A Good Lawyer's Wife). Because the story's controversial nature discouraged investors, many of the cast and crew donated their services, some even bringing family members along to play villager roles when the three months of filming began in August 2006. \\"I'll take pride in myself for a long time for taking part in this film,\\" actor Kim Roi-ha told a reporter. Director Lee chose as the movie's title the name of a highly popular South Korean political protest song of the 1980s. A long post-production period ended in March 2009, and the film premiered on Oct. 8, 2009, at the 14th Busan International Film Festival in Busan, South Korea.

Over the course of the war, between 7,000 and 20,000 ladies' aid societies were established.Blair, William (2000). Making and remaking Pennsylvania's Civil War. University Park, Pa.: Pennsylvania State Univ. Press. p. 273. . The work these women did in providing sanitary supplies and blankets to soldiers helped lessen the spread of diseases during the Civil War. In the North, their work was supported by the U.S. Sanitary Commission. At the end of the war, many ladies' aid societies in the South transformed into memorial associations.Frank, Lisa Tendrich (2008). Women in the American Civil War. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO. p. 96. . Free black women often formed their own ladies' aid societies, like the Colored Ladies Soldiers' Aid Society of St. Louis, Missouri, headed by Mary Meachum, which tended to black Union soldiers at the local hospital. Jeannie Attie, Patriotic Toil: Northern Women and the Civil War, Cornell University Press, 1998 The Sanitary Commission Although war causes many casualties, for every one man that died during the Civil War, two people died from disease. Dysentery, diarrhea, typhoid and malaria, were all diseases caused by the overcrowdedness and unsanitary conditions during the war. People began addressing the importance of having clean water, good clean food, and fresh air to breath. Women decided to take initiative. They began collecting food, clothing, medicine, or anything usable for the soldiers in need. However the women had an issue. They were not sure how they would be able to deliver the supplies to the soldiers. So, they held a conference in New York for all the doctors, lawyers, and clergymen interested in helping the soldiers. The result of this event led to the formation of the Sanitary Commission. The sanitation was organized, run, and supplied by the civilians. Soldiers' Aid Society of Northern Ohio At the Ladies‚Äô Aid Society a group of women from Cleveland met and organized a \\"blanket raid\\" to collect blankets for the troops of soldiers. Months after the women organized the raid, they connected with other local groups to create the Soldiers' Aid Society. The organization was financed by private donations to care for the sick and wounded. They provided hospital service, food, clothing, and medical supplies. They established their distribution center at 95 Bank (W. 6th) St. From February 22 to March 10, 1864, the women from the Soldiers' Aid Society held a Sanitation Fair. The fair was organized to raise money to help soldiers during the Civil War. After the Civil War When the war was over, soldiers who came home were still in need of medical care, so many ladies' aid societies continued to support hospitals and war veterans. As they volunteered, women picked up nursing skills and some of them continued into nursing careers after the war. References Further reading * Attie, Rejean (1998).

She ruled over Manu'a, a group of islands in the eastern part of the Samoan Islands (present day American Samoa). During her tenure, she served largely a ceremonial role at her residence on Ta'≈´ where she received British writer Robert Louis Stevenson. Matelita never married because she would not marry any of the eligible native chieftains and no other men were regarded as having the proper rank to marry her. She died of illness in 1895 although later reports claimed she died by a more violent means. She was buried in the Tui Manu'a Graves Monument. Life and reign She was born on 31 December 1872. Her parents were Arthur Pa ªu Young and of Amipelia. Her father's heritage was half-Samoan and half-white; her grandfather was either a British or American surnamed Young and her grandmother was a Samoan woman of Fasito'o (located in the western Samoan Islands). On her mother's side, Matelita was a descendant of Tui Manu'a Taliutafa Tupolo, son of Tui Manu'a Moaatoa, of the anoalo class, the lineal descendants of the Tui Manu'a line. The family resided in the main two villages of 'o LumƒÅ and Sƒ´'ufaga, on Ta'≈´, the main island of the Manu'a group, where her father was a trader. The family lived in a two-story stone house in the center of the two villages near the Protestant Christian church. Map of the Manu'a islands After the death of Tui Manu'a Alalamua, the paramount title was left vacant and disputed. An election took place in the faletolu, the council which traditionally decided on the next Tui Manu'a. The two candidates were Matelita and Taofi, a son of Tui Manu'a Tauveve. The anoalo led by Arthur Pa ªu Young weighed in in favor of Matelita. The decision was not accepted initially by the main line of the Tui Manu'a, but Taofi conceded to Matelita and she became the new paramount chief of the group, ascending to the title on 1 July 1891. She was crowned in a traditional ceremony consisting of feasting, offering of food, kava drinking in the days before and after 13 July 1891. During her tenure, she primarily filled a ceremonial role and resided on the main island of Ta'≈´. In 1895, she gave a speech consecrating a new church. Contemporary and posthumous European and American accounts of her life portray her as a mere figurehead and as a white queen of the South Seas. Matelita never married because she would not marry any of the eligible native chieftains and no other men were regarded as having the proper rank to marry her. Meeting Robert Louis Stevenson Robert Louis Stevenson, a British writer and expatriate in Samoa, visited Matelita and the islands of the Manu'a group in 1894 aboard . During his two-day sojourn on the island, he stayed in a guest house belonging to the queen and was served the traditional kava drink. He described how Matelita had little to do and was not able to travel outside the capital village of Ta'≈´. In a later letter written to Henry James, Stevenson stated: Death and legacy Matelita fell ill in September 1895 and died peacefully in her sleep, after the illness, on 29 October 1895.; ; Later sources claimed she died after a kerosene lamp overturned causing her mosquito net to catch fire while she slept. This is not supported by contemporary sources of the Protestant missionaries which stated she died of illness. Elisala was elected as her successor to the title Tui Manu'a in 1899. After Elisala's death, the title was abolished by the United States, which had earlier incorporated the islands as a part of American Samoa. Matelita's brother Chris Taliutafa Young unsuccessfully attempted to claim the Tui Manu'a in 1924. Monument To The Late Queen of Manua, 1896 After her death, she was buried next to some of the preceding Tui Manu'a title holders and eventually her successor Elisala after his death. A marble monument was built over her final resting place. The tombstone, which is the most visible monument in the royal burial ground that is delineated by a stone enclosure, consisted of a round column on a square base. The inscriptions on the base memorializes, in both the English and Samoan language, the life of the Tui Manu'a including the words: These are my last words to you all, \\"May you live in peace\\". This grave site known as the Tui Manu'a Graves Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. American anthropologist Margaret Mead, who conducted research in Samoa between 1925 and 1926, was given the name Makelita by locals in her memory.

Jimirro, who had previously been the founding president of the Disney Channel and then a CBS executive. J2 Communications distributed ITC Entertainment titles on VHS at one point in the late 1980s and also distributed Dorf, a comedy series starring Tim Conway. In 1990, J2 Communications bought National Lampoon magazine and all its related properties from the then owners Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson, who had acquired the magazine in a hostile takeover in 1989. J2 Communications went on to make money by licensing out the brand name \\"National Lampoon\\" to other companies who wished to make films and similar projects. J2 Communications was contractually obliged to publish at least one new issue of the magazine per year in order to retain the rights to the \\"National Lampoon\\" name. The company showed very little interest in the magazine itself; throughout the 1990s, the number of issues per year varied unpredictably. In 1991 there was an attempt at monthly publication; nine issues were produced. Only two issues were released in 1992. This was followed by one issue in 1993, five in 1994, and three in 1995. After that the magazine was published only once a year for three years, the last issue being November 1998. After this the contract was renegotiated, and J2 Communications was then prohibited from publishing issues of the magazine. J2, however, still owned the rights to the brand name \\"National Lampoon\\", which it continued to franchise out to other users. In 2002 the company J2 Communications was sold to Daniel Laikin and renamed \\"National Lampoon Inc.\\". James P. Jimirro stayed on as CEO until January 2005.

On 13 May, Garc√≠a Conde surrendered with his 7,000 surviving soldiers. Lleida (L√©rida) is a city in the western part of Catalonia. Margalef is located on Route N-240 about southeast of L√©rida. The siege occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. After a fruitless attempt to seize Valencia in March, Suchet determined to move against L√©rida. By mid- April, the French were before the city. Suchet heard that a Spanish army commanded by Henry O'Donnell was trying to interfere with the planned operation. O'Donnell's column was intercepted and in the Battle of Margalef on 23 April, it was routed with heavy losses. This action was followed by a siege in which Suchet used brutal methods to bring a speedy surrender. On 13 May, Garc√≠a Conde capitulated with his 7,000 surviving soldiers. This event was the start of an astonishing series of successful sieges from 1810 to 1812 in which Suchet's troops seemed to be unstoppable. Background In January 1810, General of Division Louis Gabriel Suchet commanded the French III Corps, with three infantry divisions commanded by Generals of Division Anne-Gilbert Laval and Louis Fran√ßois F√©lix Musnier, and General of Brigade Pierre-Joseph Habert. Laval's 1st Division consisted of 4,290 effectives in six battalions, Musnier's 2nd Division counted 7,173 men in 11 battalions, and Habert's 3rd Division numbered 4,329 soldiers in seven battalions. General of Brigade Andr√© Joseph Boussart led the 1,899 troopers of the corps cavalry brigade. These were divided into two unusually strong regiments, one heavy and one light. The III Corps also had 1,287 gunners, sappers, and other attached troops. Suchet's total of 23,140 effectives included 4,162 soldiers in garrisons.Gates (2002), 495Broughton, La Val, Musnier, Habert, and Boussart. This source provided the full names and ranks of the generals. That month, Suchet planned to move against the Spanish-held cities of L√©rida and Mequinenza. However, he received positive orders to move directly against Valencia instead. King Joseph Bonaparte was in the process of overrunning Andalusia and believed that the Spanish armies were on the verge of collapse. Suchet reluctantly obeyed the king's command and his army reached the outskirts of Valencia on 6 March. Lacking siege artillery and facing a determined set of defenders, the French general retreated after blockading the city for only four days. Back in his base in Aragon, Suchet spent a few weeks suppressing Spanish guerillas before he was ready to march on L√©rida.Gates (2002), 290 Suchet's army arrived in front of L√©rida on 15 April. The 13,000 French soldiers were organized into 18 battalions and eight squadrons and supplied with 30 artillery pieces. Musnier's 2nd Division included three battalions each of the 114th, 115th, and 121st Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the 1st Legion of the Vistula, and two foot artillery batteries. Habert's 3rd Division comprised two battalions each of the 5th Light and 116th Line, three battalions of the 117th Line, and two foot artillery batteries. Boussart's cavalry was made up of the 4th Hussar and 13th Cuirassier Regiments, and a horse artillery battery. The fortress of L√©rida was armed with 105 cannons. Major General Jaime Garc√≠a Conde led the 8,000 Spanish defenders, including 350 gunners.Smith (1998), 342 In September 1809, Garc√≠a Conde successfully led a 4,000-man re-supply convoy during the Siege of Gerona. During the operation he broke through the Italian defenders and delivered supplies and reinforcements before escaping.Gates (2002), 169 Battle of Margalef Jean Isidore Harispe While Suchet was preparing to invest L√©rida, he received intelligence that a relieving column was hurrying toward the city. Determined to intercept this force, Suchet set out with Musnier's division. After hours of futile searching, the French turned back toward L√©rida and bivouacked from the city on the evening of 22 April. Unknown to Suchet, Major General Henry O'Donnell's relief army had avoided detection and was camped nearby. The Spanish force had as many as 8,000Gates (2002), 291 or as few as 7,000 troops, including 300 cavalry and six cannons. Musnier's division had all of its components except the 121st Line and numbered 5,500 men. In addition, there were 500 troopers of the 4th Hussars and 13th Cuirassiers. On 23 April, O'Donnell's lead division under Major General Miguel Ibarrola Gonz√°les bumped into General of Brigade Jean Isidore Harispe's small French force east of L√©rida. Harispe managed to contain the numerically superior Spanish column until Musnier's division appeared on the scene. Ibarrola immediately beat a hasty retreat with Musnier in headlong pursuit. At the hamlet of Margalef, the Spanish were attempting to fend off the French when the 13th Cuirassiers charged into their flank. Ibarrola's division disintegrated as the heavy cavalrymen slashed and hacked at the fleeing foot soldiers. Just as the butchery ended, O'Donnell showed up with his second division. The Spanish general quickly backtracked but the French cavalry were soon at his soldiers' heels. Again, the cuirassiers caught up with the Spaniards and rode down their rear guard, inflicting more casualties.Gates (2002), 290-291 At Margalef, O'Donnell lost 500 killed and wounded. In addition, the victorious French seized 2,500 prisoners, three guns, and four colors. The French lost 100 men, all from the 13th Cuirassiers. The infantry were present, but not involved in the fighting. One account stated that 3,000 Spaniards were captured and that French losses were 120 men.Gates (2002), 291 Siege Louis Gabriel Suchet Having disposed of O'Donnell's relief army, Suchet invested L√©rida and demanded the city's surrender but Garc√≠a Conde refused his summons. The city lay on the west bank of the Segre River with a t√™te-de-pont on the east bank. A hill to the north was crowned by the citadel while Fort Garden and two redoubts were located on a hill to the south. The northern wall between the citadel and the Segre was particularly weak. Suchet posted Musnier's men and the majority of his cavalry on the east bank to watch for any relief forces. Habert's troops faced the northern and western walls on the west bank. A temporary bridge connected the two parts of the besieging corps.Rickard (2008), Siege of Lerida The formal siege began on 29 April. Suchet brought up his siege train and on 7 May had a battery of heavy cannons in action. L√©rida's defenses proved no match for Suchet's artillery. The French guns took the Carmen and Magdelena bastions under fire, causing serious damage. Within six days, the siege cannons battered a breach in the wall. Meanwhile, the French attacked the forts on the southern hill. After one repulse, the French overran the two redoubts on the night of 12-13 May. Late on 13 May, assault columns rushed the breach and seized it. The defenders had built a new line behind the breach, but the French overcame these defenses also. At this, Garc√≠a Conde ordered his soldiers to withdraw into the citadel. Showing no moral scruples, Suchet ordered his soldiers to drive the civilian population under the castle's walls. Any person who resisted was instantly murdered by the French soldiers. After the Spanish commander admitted the non-combatants into the citadel, the French began a high-angle bombardment of the castle, using howitzers and mortars. These killed most of the 500 civilians who died during the siege. Horrified at the slaughter as bursting shells struck down soldiers and civilians alike, Garc√≠a Conde asked for terms at noon on 14 May. The surrender netted 7,000 Spanish soldiers as prisoners. During the siege, the Spanish garrison suffered 1,700 killed and wounded. Among the French trophies were six generals, 307 officers, and 105 artillery pieces. French casualties numbered about 1,000 killed and wounded. Aftermath The seizure of L√©rida was the beginning of a remarkable series of successful sieges by Suchet's apparently invincible army. The III Corps began the Siege of Mequinenza on 15 May 1810 and the place fell on 5 June.Smith (1998), 343 The Siege of Tortosa ended on 2 January 1811 when General Conde de Alacha Lilli capitulated with 3,974 survivors, 182 guns, and nine colors.Smith (1998), 353Gates (2002), 292-295 Suchet followed this success with the Siege of Tarragona. After a climactic assault on 28 June, Lieutenant General Juan Senen de Contreras was captured and his large garrison was annihilated. For this victory, Emperor Napoleon I made Suchet a Marshal of France.Smith (1998), 365Gates (2002), 296-301 Immediately after Suchet's triumph at the Battle of Saguntum on 25 October 1811, the fortress of Sagunto (Saguntum) surrendered.Gates (2002), 317-322 This was followed by Suchet's greatest coup of all. The Siege of Valencia ended when Captain General Joaquin Blake y Joyes capitulated with 16,270 men on 9 January 1812.Smith (1998), 373-374Gates (2002), 322-324 Soon afterward, the fortresses of D√©nia and Peniscola submitted to the French, making Suchet the master of the province of Valencia.Gates (2002), 325 Notes  References   Category:Battles of the Peninsular War Category:Sieges of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Battles in Catalonia Category:Sieges involving Spain Category:Sieges involving France Category:Conflicts in 1810 Category:1810 in Spain Category:April 1810 events Category:May 1810 events ","title":"Siege of L√©rida"},{"id":"33957665","text":"An uncertain plural occurs when a writer does not know in advance whether a word should be written in the singular or plural.

Garland was born in Glasgow to ironworker James Garland and Agnes, n√©e Weldon. He attended primary school but was soon working in engineering shops on Clydeside, where he was a recognised leader among the youths. In 1910 he became an apprentice fitter for the engineering and shipbuilding firm A. & J. Inglis, and also joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the outbreak of World War I he became an engine-room artificer and served in HMS Drake until 1915 and HMS Caroline until 1916, being involved in the Battle of Jutland. He trained young artificers at Portsmouth from November 1916 and was invalided out of the navy on 25 September 1919. In 1921 he emigrated to Victoria. In Australia Garland found work with the State Electricity Company. He married Edith Mary Downey at North Fitzroy on 9 February 1924. He was a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and was later dismissed for his involvement, moving to Adelaide. In 1929 he was elected president of the AEU's Adelaide district committee and a delegate to the Trades and Labor Council. He joined the Communist Party of Australia, was involved in the 1930 waterside workers' strike, and aided those arrested after the 1931 \\"beef riot\\". Sacked by his employer Holden in 1932, he made several unsuccessful bids for public office, running for the South Australian House of Assembly in 1933 and 1941, the Australian House of Representatives in 1934 and the Australian Senate in 1940. In 1933 he became secretary of the Anti-War Council and his continued and strident opposition to \\"capitalist wars\\" led to his house being raided in August 1939 after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. He addressed a meeting of the League Against Conscription in 1940, for which he was fined, but by 1942, when Australia was under threat of Japanese invasion, Garland had become a supporter of conscription. Towards the end of the war Garland turned his attention to the handling of industrial disputes and reconstruction, and in 1945 resigned from the Communist Party over tactical disagreements. He had co-founded Common Cause, a workers' peace movement, in 1942 and it enjoyed early success, but was disbanded in 1949. His secretaryship of the Gasworkers' Union from 1937 to 1946 had been the first time a Communist Party member had served as a union secretary in South Australia. He was also president of the South Australian Trades and Labor Council from 1936 to 1937 and from 1943 to 1945 and became its secretary in 1946, holding the position until 1949. His past made it difficult for him to find work; he subsequently became secretary-clerk at the McKechnie Iron Foundry. A long-time sufferer from heart disease, he died of coronary thrombosis at Kilkenny in 1952.

In the laboratory, adults live for about 16 days and lays eggs in the host abdomen. P. pseudopallipes has cytochrome C oxidase, a key component in the respiratory chain reaction for the reduction of oxygen into water. P. pseudopallipes has olfactory responses to the odors of some food plants of its host. The attractive odor comes from the flowers. Responsiveness was shown to be related to the number of eggs in their ovaries. P. pseudopallipes was shown to have high attraction to the flowers of Erigeron spp. and these flowers were also preferred for feeding. Parasitism P. pseudopallipes infects the nymphal stage of Lygus lineolaris between the end of July and the beginning of August. This usually occurs in fields of Erigeron, which act as a nectar source for the host. The P. pseudopallipes female will lay an egg in the hemolymph of the L. lineolaris nymph. There, three instars of P. pseudopallipes will develop. After the P. pseudopallipes larvae emerge, the host will persist for a few hours or days. The larvae will weave a cocoon and emerge fourteen days later as an adult. However, the parasite may remain in diapause for one year to reemerge in the spring. Host competition P. pseudopallipes is one of four parasites known to attack L. lineolaris. The other three are Peristenus stygicus, P. digoneutis, P. pallipes. Biocontrol Host L. lineolaris feeds on over 300 plant species and causes at least two billion dollars in losses per year. Because P. pseudopallipes and other genus members cause host death shortly after hatching, introducing Peristenus spp. to fields has been considered to control the L. lineolaris population.Hudson W et al.

The area was originally claimed by France in 1682 as part of La Louisiane, the extent of which was largely defined by the watershed of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Over the following centuries, explorers of French ethnicity, many of them French-Canadian, trapped, hunted, and established settlements and trading posts across much of the northern Great Plains including the territory that would eventually become Nebraska, even in the period after France formally ceded its North American claims to Spain.\\"Nebraska\\", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1910 During the 19th century, fur trading gave way to settlements and farming across the state, and French colonists and French- American migrants continued to operate businesses and build towns in Nebraska. Many of their descendants continue to live in the state. Political history According to historian Addison Erwin Sheldon, the French knew of the Otoe and Missouri tribes in Nebraska as early as 1673.Sheldon, et al. (19--) Nebraska history, Volumes 4-5 . Nebraska State Historical Society. p 60. In 1682, French explorer Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle claimed the area first when he named all the territory drained by the Mississippi River and its tributaries for France, naming it La Louisiane (Louisiana). In 1714, fellow French explorer √âtienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont traveled from the mouth of the Missouri River in Missouri to the mouth of the Platte River, which he called the Rivi√®re Nebraskier, becoming the first person to approximate the state's name.Dan Hechenberger, \\"Etienne de V√©niard sieur de Bourgmont - A timeline\\" , The Lewis and Clark Journey of Discovery, National Park Service Brothers and French-Canadian voyageurs Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet sought to reach Santa Fe, New Mexico by water via what they renamed the Platte River in 1739. They ended up following the south fork of the Platte into what is now Colorado. French colonists settled throughout the Mississippi Valley, first to the east of the river in areas such as present-day Illinois. Trappers and traders established relationships with Native American tribes at major points around the Great Lakes and along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. In the Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762, France ceded its lands west of the Mississippi River to Spain. In 1794 a French trapper named Jean-Baptiste Truteau established a trading post 30 miles up the Niobrara River. The next year, in 1795, Jacques D'Eglise traveled the Missouri River Valley on behalf of the Spanish crown. Searching for the elusive Northwest Passage, D'Eglise did not go any further than central North Dakota. In 1803 the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France for $15,000,000. What became Nebraska was under the \\"rule\\" of the United States for the first time. Business presence The first Europeans to see the Platte River were French explorers and fur trappers in about 1714; they first called it the Nebraskier (Nebraska), a transliteration of the name given by the Otoe people, meaning \\"flat water\\". Jean Pierre Cabann√© operated a fur trading post north of Omaha along the Missouri. Other French-Canadian posts in Nebraska include the Bordeaux Trading Post, the Post of the Otos, and the Robidoux Pass Trading Post. The Spaniard Manuel Lisa, a partner of the French-dominated Missouri Trading Company, established Fort Lisa north of Omaha in the Ponca Hills in the early 1800s. Due to his positive relationships with many tribes, Lisa thwarted British influence with their allied tribes in the area during the War of 1812. In 1820 the U.S. Army established Fort Atkinson near the present-day town of Fort Calhoun in order to protect the area's burgeoning fur trade industry. In 1822 the Missouri Fur Company built a headquarters and trading post about nine miles north of the mouth of the Platte River on the site of Fontenelle's Post. Calling it Bellevue, these French-Americans established the first town in Nebraska. In 1824 Jean-Pierre Cabann√© established Cabanne's Trading Post for John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company near Fort Lisa, at the confluence of Ponca Creek and the Missouri River. It became a well-known post in the region. Placenames The town of Barada was named after Antoine Barada, whose father was the French fur trapper and interpreter Michel Barada. Early French Canadian trappers named the area south of Omaha Belle Vue because of the beauty of the view from the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River. Later, a fur trading post on that spot grew into the city of Bellevue. The town of Du Bois was named for the forest surrounding the area. Fremont was named for John C. Fr√©mont, French-American pioneer and politician. Both Loup County and the Loup River were named after the Skidi Pawnee people, who called themselves the Wolf People. The town of Papillion was named from the French word papillon, which means \\"butterfly\\". The Platte County and Platte River were named for the French word for \\"flat,\\" a translation of the Oto.(2007) \\"History at a glance\\" , Douglas County Historical Society. Retrieved February 2, 2008. Sarpy County was named after Peter Abadie Sarpy, a fur trader of French Creole origin, born in New Orleans, Louisiana. Early French maps noted an area called, \\"L'eau qui Pleure\\", the water that weeps, which today is the town of Weeping Water. The town of Fontenelle was named after Logan Fontenelle, the son of the French Creole Lucien Fontenelle from New Orleans and Me-um-bane, his Omaha wife and a daughter of Big Elk, the principal chief. As an interpreter to the Omaha and United States, the younger Fontenelle was important during negotiations of the Treaty of 1854, by which the Omaha ceded most of their land to the United States. Several other places in Nebraska have been named after Logan Fontenelle, as well. In 1840, Joseph Deroin set up a trading post along the Missouri River at the mouth of the Platte, at the main village of the Otoe.

Retrieved 8/9/08. The town of St. Deroin grew up around the trading post and was named in 1853 after Joseph Deroin was killed in an argument. Today it is a ghost town. In 1885, the town of Chadron was platted and named in honor of Pierre Chadron, a French-Indian trapper who lived and trapped in the area. He was at one time a trader for the American Fur Company. The town of Bordeaux was named for Pierre Bordeaux, a French trapper and trader who came from Bordeaux, France, and took his name from that city.

However, she fears that Aeolus (bass) could ruin the celebrations with heavy storms in August. With the help of Zephyrus (tenor), the god of mild winds, and Pomona, the goddess of fruitfulness (alto), Pallas manages to appease Aeolus, and those present grant a in unison for the professor.

Playing career High school Pegues, a 6'5\\", 240-lb power forward from Forestville, Maryland, played at national basketball power DeMatha Catholic High School from 1992 to 1996 and was a teammate of former Philadelphia Eagles running back Brian Westbrook. His head coach was Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Morgan Wootten. During his four-year high school career he compiled an overall record of 105‚Äì26, including two #1 rankings in the Washington, D.C. area. College After graduating from DeMatha Catholic in 1996, Pegues enrolled at the University of Delaware on a basketball scholarship to play for head coach Mike Brey (who is, coincidentally, also a DeMatha alumnus). During a college career that spanned between 1996 and 2000, Pegues became the first player in school history to earn three first team all-conference selections as well as its first conference player of the year. He scored a still-standing Delaware record 2,030 points and guided the Fightin' Blue Hens to two NCAA Tournaments (1998, 1999) and one National Invitation Tournament (2000). In both 1997‚Äì98 and 1998‚Äì99, Delaware was America East regular season and tournament champions. When he was named the America East Conference Player of the Year as a junior, Pegues averaged 21.8 points per game. Although he did not repeat as player of the year as a senior, his overall career was good enough to have him enshrined in the University of Delaware Hall of Fame in 2007. Professional Pegues did not get selected in the 2000 NBA Draft but did manage to carve out a professional career that took him to Italy, England, Argentina, New Zealand and the Continental Basketball Association in the United States. Coaching career A knee injury ended his playing career after several seasons and he became a teacher at Friendship Collegiate Academy Public Charter School. He also coached high school and Amateur Athletic Union basketball. In 2009‚Äì10, Pegues served as the video coordinator at Virginia Commonwealth before joining the staff at Delaware in 2010‚Äì11. In 2012, Pegues was hired as an assistant for coach Chris Mack at Xavier.

It enables the application software to receive additional information about the intended interpretation of the message contained within the barcode symbol and even details about the scan itself. ECI was developed as a symbology-independent extension of the Global Label Identifier (GLI) system used in the PDF417 bar code.  Description  In the default mode, where Extended Channel Interpretation is not in effect, the interface between the reader and the host is said to be in \\"Basic Channel Mode\\". In this mode, each octet of transmitted data is defined (by the corresponding bar code symbology standard) to correspond directly to a single code point in some default character set, normally ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Latin-1). However, when ECI is in effect, the data interface is said to be in \\"Extended Channel Mode\\". The interpretation of the transmitted data is defined by the current ECI modes that are enabled, which are activated and deactivated by \\"ECI indicators\\" that are included in the transmitted data. Since the ECI information is not intended to be part of the bar code message it should be transparent when rendering the message. The application presents the user with the intended message, but does not normally render the various ECI indicators that the application used to derive this message. However, within the data transmission protocol the use of ECI is indicated explicitly by a modification to the symbology indicator that the decoder will recognize and interpret accordingly in order to disambiguate between ECI and non-ECI encoded messages. If the reader is not ECI enabled or the application does not support the ECI indicators that are in effect then the scan should be aborted.  Types of ECI indicator  ECI indicators may be included at various points in the transmitted message, and may be either of \\"encodable\\" type or of \\"non- encodable\\" or \\"signal\\" type. ; Encodable ECIs : These indicators are part of the message and define the format for all or part of the data, such as the intended character set or the data compression scheme that is in effect such as Gzip. ; Signal ECIs : These indicators are not part of the message and they may either be embedded in the bar code symbol separately from the message or may not be present in the symbol at all but added by the reader at scan time. Signal ECIs are used to convey information about the processing of the data, such as whether it is a fragment of a multi-symbol scan process, whether an error condition occurred during reading, or even to provide environment information such as what ambient light level was measured or provide a low- battery indication.  Common use case: Enable support for international character sets  The most common use for Extended Channel Interpretation is to allow usually unsupported national character sets such as Arabic, Greek, or Japanese to be used reliably in bar code symbols.Extended Channel Interpretation ‚Äî \\"Unicode for Barcodes\\" An ECI-enabled bar code symbol may use several character sets by embedding several character set ECI indicators to delimit segments of the message that are encoded using different code pages.

After a stint as a garrison doctor at Strzalkow, near Wreschen, he was transferred to Lissa, where he served as a military physician. At Lissa he distinguished himself in his skillful work dealing with the severely wounded. In 1848 Metzig began openly working for greater autonomy for the Polish people, proposing the creation of an independent state with its own parliament, constitution and university. His efforts in this cause did not sit well with German authorities. When the military decided to transfer him to Glogau, Metzig refused the move, choosing to stay in Lissa, where he opened a private medical practice.

Glenn Jr., pilot of the Mercury-Atlas 6 earth-orbital space mission, confers with Astronaut Nurse Dolores O'Hara during prelaunch preparations. Space nursing is a specialty that works with astronauts to determine medical fitness for their missions, equips NASA team members to handle emergencies in orbit and researches the effects of space travel on the human body. The career got its start during the space race of the 1960s and has grown‚Äîboth in terms of number of people in the field and knowledge base‚Äîever since. Research conducted by medical professionals in the aeronautics field has led to many breakthroughs in disease treatment of earthbound patients and the discipline continually develops new technology to make space medicine more effective. History  The early days  Since the beginning of commercial aviation in the 1920s, nurses have been part of aviation and flight. In 1958, President Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act to form NASA. Part of this act was to recruit nurses to work closely with medical teams to determine the health of astronauts prior to launch. Following their return, nurses assisted with performing medical assessments to determine the effects of space travel on the mission team.  The first space nurses  Lt Dolores \\"Dee\\" O'Hara (born 1935) and Lt Shirley Sineath were the first nurses assigned to work with the seven Project Mercury astronauts. Lieutenant O'Hara was the official staff nurse while Lieutenant Sineath was assigned as a surgical nurse on the recovery team.[5] Before her career with NASA, O‚ÄôHara worked as a registered nurse in the labor and delivery ward of Patrick Air Force Base in Cape Canaveral, FL. In 1959, she was called into the office of Colonel Knauf (the commander of the hospital). Knauf offered her a job as a nurse for Project Mercury and she accepted. Part of the reason O'Hara was selected for the team was so that she could gain the trust of the astronauts. NASA figured if the astronauts trusted their nurses, they would inform them when they were feeling ill‚Äîsomething they wouldn‚Äôt tell their flight surgeons for fear that their flight would be grounded. In an interview conducted in 2002, O‚ÄôHara described her job as being to \\"go aboard recovery ships‚Ä¶be available [to] set up little hospitals aboard ships, should there be a problem upon landing\\" and to \\"put together these medical kits and everything that people on board the ships would need to treat an injured astronaut.\\" Additionally, it was O'Hara's responsibility to perform the pre-flight physicals, which included height, weight, temperatures and blood pressure measurements.[3] Following her career as a nurse to astronauts, O'Hara transferred to a role as manager of the Human Research Facility at Ames Research center in 1974, where she worked until her retirement in 1997.  Present day space nursing   Career path and necessary qualifications  In 1962 NASA announced the Space Nursing Program, which required applicants to have a previous bachelor's degree in nursing, a requirement that has remained to the present day. There are 2 main categories of career paths to working in aerospace medicine at NASA. The military route involves enlistment in either the US Air Force‚Äîwhich offers a residency program for space medicine at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio‚Äîor US Navy (which offers a similar program at The Naval Aerospace Medical Institute in Pensacola, Florida). The civilian path entails courses at a university or institution, followed by a month-long clerkship at NASA, which they offer to medical students in their fourth year. Wright State University, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and Mayo Clinic are currently the only entities in the US with aerospace medicine programs.  Medical complications surrounding space travel  = Problems emerging during or upon return from space flight = * Lightheadedness * Deterioration of proprioception (ability to sense the movement and location of ones body) * Slower wound healing * Immune system suppression * Muscle atrophy * Reduction in bone density * Facial swelling * Height increase * Low blood pressure * Fainting * Blurred vision * Poor nutrition: weight loss, dehydration * Disruption to sleep patterns * Fatigue * Poor coordination * Possible decreased fertility = Complications that can develop years later = * Cancer due to radiation * Hyperthyroidism * Cataracts  The future of space nursing   Technology  There are many new devices and techniques, either in the process of research and development or already in use, to improve space medicine. A few examples are: * Remote/telepresence surgery- a surgeon on earth controls robotic instruments that are physically performing the surgery in space * Computer-Assisted Design and Computer Assisted Manipulation (CAD-CAM)- medical supplies assembled by technology using specification data contained on board or communicated from Earth * Telemedicine- high quality pictures of injuries or symptoms experienced in orbit sent to a doctor on Earth who is then able to diagnose and recommend treatment without being physically present * Devices that make medicine- the shelf life of many pharmaceuticals are not long enough to remain viable for long-term missions. Researchers are considering technology that manufactures drugs from stored substrates as they are needed by astronauts. = Implications of space nursing on earthly medicine = In 2018, Dr. Serena Au√±√≥n-Chancellor completed a six-month space expedition to collect samples of her body fluids to be analyzed on earth. Her research has led to new knowledge and possible treatment breakthroughs for osteoporosis, Parkinson‚Äôs, cancer and fertility.

It was launched in November 2011.  History  British Library Newspapers, Colindale The British Library Newspapers section was based in Colindale in North London, until 2013, and is now divided between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The Library has an almost complete collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This is partly because of the legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of microfilm containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45 km of shelves. After the closure of Colindale in November 2013, access to the 750 million original printed pages was maintained via an automated and climate-controlled storage facility in Boston Spa. This opened in April 2014.  Digitisation  In May 2010, a ten-year programme of digitization of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began. In November 2011, BBC News announced the launch of the British Newspaper Archive, an initiative to facilitate online access to over one million pages of pre-20th century newspapers. The same newspapers from this partnership have also been made available to view on Findmypast and Genes Reunited. The digitisation project established an online search facility which people could consult without having to visit the British Library newspaper depository in person. Among the collections are the Thomason Tracts, containing 7,200 17th-century newspapers, and the Burney Collection, featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. The Thomason Tracts and Burney collections are held at St Pancras, and are available in digital facsimile. The section also has extensive records of non-British newspapers in languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. The Library's substantial holdings of newspapers in the languages of Asia and the Middle East may be accessed at the Library's reading rooms at St. Pancras.

She is also known for her theories on the tantric nature of the Tangut state, and for her proposition of the existence of two contrasting forms of Tangut language, the common language used in most surviving Tangut texts, and a ritual language preserved only in a few ritual odes. Biography Kepping was born in Tianjin, China on 7 February 1937. Her father, Boris Mikhailovich von Kepping (1896‚Äì1958), had been an officer in the White Army who lived in Harbin in north-east China after the Russian Civil War (1917‚Äì1923). He subsequently married Olga Viktorovna Svyatina (1900‚Äì1992), and moved to Tianjin where her brother, the future Metropolitan Viktor (Leonid Viktorovich Svyatin, 1893‚Äì1966), was a priest (he was later appointed Bishop of Beijing and head of the Russian Spiritual Mission in China). Kepping grew up in Tianjin, and from 1945 to 1954 she was educated at a Russian school in Tianjin. During her childhood in China she learnt to speak the local Tianjin dialect of Chinese fluently. In 1955 the Russian Spiritual Mission was closed, and Kepping's family were voluntarily repatriated to the Soviet Union. Her uncle Viktor was appointed Archbishop of Krasnodar and Kuban, while her parents were sent to Central Asia. She was initially admitted into the Central Asian State University in Tashkent, but with help from her uncle she was able to transfer to the prestigious Leningrad State University in Leningrad. She studied Chinese Philology at the Faculty of Oriental Studies from 1955 to 1959, and after graduation she joined the Leningrad Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies, where she remained until her death in 2002. The Institute of Oriental Studies holds the world's largest collection of Tangut texts, which had been collected from the abandoned fortress city of Khara-Khoto by Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov in 1908, but after the execution in 1937 of the two pioneering scholars of Tangut, Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov and Nikolai Aleksandrovich Nevsky, Tangut studies had come to a halt in the Soviet Union. During the late 1950s the study of Tangut was revived under Evgenij Ivanovich Kychanov, and from 1966 Kepping started to study the extinct Tangut language and its complex script for her doctorate, focussing in particular on Tangut grammar. In 1969 she completed her doctoral dissertation, \\"Textological and Grammatical Research into the Tangut Translation of the Chinese Military Treatise Sun Tzu along with Commentaries by Three Authors\\", which was the basis for a study of the Tangut translation of Sun Tzu that was published in 1979. In 1969 she also co- edited the first scholarly edition of the Tangut rime dictionary, the Sea of Characters, and subsequently published studies of other Tangut texts, including the Forest of Categories (1983), Newly Acquired Notes on Love to the Juniors and Respect to the Seniors (1990), and The General's Garden (2003). In 1986 she was awarded the post-doctoral Doctor of Sciences degree with a dissertation on Tangut morphology. During the 1980s and 1990s, Kepping travelled abroad extensively and collaborated with scholars from other countries, including George van Driem, with whom she worked on studies of the Tangut verb and Tibetan transcriptions of Tangut, and Tibetologist Christopher Beckwith. During 1989‚Äì1990 she spent a year at the Minzu University of China in Beijing, where she worked with Chinese Tangutologists, including as Shi Jinbo, Bai Bin and Li Fanwen. During her time in China she recorded a series of lessons on Russian and Tangut for broadcast on Chinese radio and television. She also made several visits to the British Library in London to study the Tangut fragments from Khara-Khoto brought back by Aurel Stein. Tangut scholarship Kepping was the principal advocate of the theory that Tantric Buddhism was the state religion of the Tangut kingdom, and she suggested that tantric rites performed by the Emperor and Empress, as sacred personifications of the male and female principles, were central to the functioning of the state. In 1986 Japanese Tangutologist Nishida Tatsuo had noted that certain ritual Tangut odes are written using two different sets of vocabularies, which he suggested reflected the languages of two ethnic groups, a sedentary, agriculturalist population known as the \\"red-faced people\\", and a nomadic elite, known as the \\"black-headed people\\", who he thought were the ruling class of Tangut society. In a paper presented to a conference on Sino- Tibetan languages and linguistics in 1996, Kepping built on Nishida's work, formulating the terms \\"common language\\" and \\"ritual language\\" to refer to the two different forms of vocabulary. The \\"common language\\" was the ordinary Tangut language used in the vast majority of surviving Tangut texts, both secular and religious, but which only comprises about half of the nearly 6,000 Tangut characters given in Tangut dictionaries. On the other hand, the \\"ritual language\\" is composed of characters that are only found in dictionaries and a few odes. According to Kepping this ritual language was an artificial language without any grammatical morphemes which was created for ritual purposes by shamans at a time prior to the adoption of Buddhism by the Tangut people, and is only preserved in a few ancient ritual odes.

History Terra de Promissio was founded, developed and is operated by husband and wife Charles Karren and Diana Karren. Charles and Diana oversaw the planting of 33,000 vines in 2002. Terra de Promissio had its first harvest in 2005 and sold to 3 wineries. In 2012 and 2013, they planted an additional 18,000 vines to bring the total planted acreage of Terra de Promissio to 50 acres. In 2015, the vineyard had its 11th harvest and sold fruit to 13 wineries. Vineyard Terra de Promissio encompasses 50 acres of pinot noir vines. The first 32 acres were planted in 2002 to Dijon Clones 115 and 777. In 2012 and 2013, the remaining 18 acres were planted to Clones 943, 97 and Field Blend - which the winemakers sometime call Calera. Wineries The following wineries use Terra de Promissio fruit to make their wine: Castello di Amorosa, Domaine Della, Dutcher Crossing, Hanzell, Kistler, Kosta Browne, Land of Promise, Lynmar Estate, Notre Vin, Senses, Soliste, Spell Estate, Whetstone, and Williams Selyem. Seven wineries give Terra de Promissio a vineyard designation: Castello di Amorosa, Domaine Della, Land of Promise, Notre Vin, Spell Estate, Whetstone and Williams Selyem. Awards In 2011, Wine Spectator named the 2009 Kosta Browne Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir as its 2011 Wine of the Year. The wine comprises fruit from three vineyards including Terra de Promissio. It is the first Sonoma County wine to win the award since 1999 and the first ever Pinot Noir wine to win. Wine Spectator editors tasted and reviewed over 16,000 new releases from 12 countries and they noted the Kosta Browne Sonoma Coast bottling showcases Michael Browne's meticulous winemaking and the quality of their grape sources. The 2009 Kosta Browne Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir rated 95 points on Wine Spectator's 100-point scale. Since the inaugural vintage in 2005, Terra de Promissio wines have received over 20 scores of 90 or more, including a 96 for the 2011 Williams Selyem Terra de Promissio and 94 for the 2009 Lynmar Terra de Promissio, the highest score Lynmar has ever received from Wine Spectator. Land of Promise In late 2015, Charles Karren, Diana Karren, and Diana's sister Alina Zarr launched Land of Promise Wine. The wine is a Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir made exclusively with grapes from Terra de Promissio. For the 2013 vintage, 100 cases were made.

There are many theories that support the importance of nurses approaching the patient holistically and how education on this are there to support the goal of holistic nursing. The important skill to be used in holistic nursing would be communicating skills with patients and other practitioners. These emphasizes that patients being treated would be treated not only their body but also mind and spirit. Holistic nursing is a nursing speciality concerning the integration of one's mind, body, and spirit with his or her environment. This speciality has a theoretical basis in a few grand nursing theories, most notably the science of unitary human beings, as published by Martha E. Rogers in An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing, and the mid-range theory Empowered Holistic Nursing Education, as published by Dr. Katie Love. Holistic nursing has gained recognition by the American Nurses Association (ANA) as a nursing specialty with a defined scope of practice and standards. Holistic nursing focuses on the mind, body, and spirit working together as a whole and how spiritual awareness in nursing can help heal illness. Holistic medicine focuses on maintaining optimum well-being and preventing rather than just treating disease. Symbol of Nurse hat in cartoon  Core values   The Holistic philosophy: theory and ethics  Holistic nursing is based on the fundamental theories of nursing, such as the works of Florence Nightingale and Jean Watson as well as alternative theories of world connectedness, wholeness, and healing. Holistic nurses respect the patient as the decision-maker throughout the continuum of care. The holistic nurse and patient relationship is based on a partnership in which the holistic nurse engages the patient in treatment options and healthcare choices. The holistic nurse seeks to establish a professional and ethical relationship with the patient in order to preserve the patient's sense of dignity, wholesomeness, and inner worth.  Theories of Holistic Nursing  The goal for holistic nursing is in the definition of holistic where it is to treat the patient in whole not just physically. Various nursing theories have helped on viewing the importance holistic nursing. These theories may differ on the views of holistic nursing care but have common goal which is to treat the patient in whole body and mind. One of the theories is The Intersystem Model, explaining that individuals are holistic being therefore they‚Äôre illness are interacted and adapted them as a whole not just physically. Also as health can be a different value to individuals which ranges constantly from well-being to disease. For example, despite their chronic condition the patient is satisfied with the changed healthy life for their living. In holistic nursing knowing the theory does not mean that this will be implanted in doing in real life practice many nurses are not able to apply the theory in real life.  Holistic caring process  Holistic nursing combines standard nursing interventions with various modalities that are focused on treating the patient in totality. Alternative therapies can include stress management, aroma therapy, and therapeutic touch. The combination of interventions allows the patient to heal in mind, body, and spirit by focusing on the patient's emotions, spirituality, and cultural identity as much as the illness. The six steps of the holistic caring process occur simultaneously, including assessment, diagnosis, outcomes, therapeutic plan of care, implementation, and evaluation. The holistic assessment of the patient can include spiritual, transpersonal, and energy-field assessments in combination with the standard physical and emotional assessments. The therapeutic plan of care in holistic nursing includes a highly individualized and unique plan for each patient. Holistic nurses recognize that the plan of care will change based on the individual patient, and therefore embrace healing as a process that is always changing and adapting to the individual's personal healing journey. Therapies utilized by holistic nurses include stress management techniques and alternative or complementary practices such as reiki and guided imagery. These therapy modalities are focused on empowering individuals to reduce stress levels and elicit a relaxation response in order to promote healing and well-being. The caring for patients in holistic nursing may be different to other nursing care as some may lack in caring the patient as whole which includes spiritually. In holistic nursing taking care of patient does not differ to other nursing but it is more focused on mental and spirit as well as physical health. In holistic nursing there should be a therapeutic trust with patient and nurse as caring for holistically involves knowing patient‚Äôs illness as whole. This can be only done by the patient who is the one to tell the nurse about the social, spiritual and internal illness that they are experiencing. Also as caring could be involved as assertive action, quiet support or even both which assist in understanding person‚Äôs cultural differences, physical and social needs. Through this the nurses are able to be more close in holistic care as the attitude of the nurses can meet the needs of social and spiritual of a patient. The attitude of nurse includes helping, sharing and nurturing. In holistic caring there is spiritual care where it needs an understanding of patient‚Äôs beliefs and religious views. This is the reason why there should be a therapeutic trust between nurse and patient as in order to understand and respect patient‚Äôs religious beliefs the nurse has to had get information from patient directly which is hard to get when there is not therapeutic trust. There is no specific order or a template in how to do holistic caring but the main idea of holistic caring is trying not to exclude patient‚Äôs social and internal needs and not just focus on treating on physically illness.  Holistic Communication  Holistic nurses use intentional listening techniques(\\"Focus completely on the speaker\\") and unconditional positive regard to communicate with patients. The goal of using these communication techniques is to create authentic, compassionate, and therapeutic relationships with each patient. In holistic nursing having therapeutic trust with patient and nurse gives great advantage of achieving the goal of treating patients as a whole. Therapeutic trust can be developed by having conversation with the patient. In communication the sender can also become a receiver or vice versa which in holistic nursing the nurses are the receiver of patients concern and the pass the information on to the doctor and do the vice versa. As communication is vital element in nursing it is strongly recommended to nurses to understand what is needed and how to communicate with patients. Communicating with patients can help in the performances of nurses in holistic nursing as by communicating the nurses are able to understand the cultural, social values and psychological conditions. Through this the nurses are able to satisfy the needs of a patients and as well as protecting the nurse for doing their roles as a nurse. In holistic nursing non-verbal communication is also another skill that is taught to nurses which are expressed by gestures, facial expression, posture and creating physical barriers. In holistic nursing as all individuals are not all the same but their social and psychological illness should be treated it is up to the nurse on how they communicate in order to build a therapeutic trust. To achieve the goal of holistic nursing it is important to communicate with the patient properly and to this successfully between the nurse and patient is freakiness and honesty. Without these communicating skills the nurse would not be able to build therapeutic trust and is likely to fail the goal of holistic nursing.  Building a Therapeutic Environment  Holistic nursing focuses on creating not only a therapeutic relationship with patients but also on creating a therapeutic environment for patients. Several of the therapies included in holistic nursing rely on therapeutic environments to be successful and effective. A therapeutic environment empowers patients to connect with the holistic nurse and with themselves introspectively. Depending on the environment of where the patient is holistic approach may be different and knowing this will help nurses to achieve better in holistic nursing. For patients with illness, trauma and surgery increasing sleep will benefit in recovery, blood pressure, pain relief and emotional wellbeing. As in hospital there are many disturbances which can effect in patients‚Äô quality of sleep and due to this the patients are lacking in aid for healing, recovery and emotional wellbeing. Nurse being able note or take care of patient‚Äôs sleep will determine how closely they are approaching to holistic nursing. Depending on disease some the treatment may differ and may need further check-ups or program for patients to do. For example, there are higher chance for women to get cardiovascular disease but there is less number of enrollment for cardiac rehabilitation program compared to men. This was due to the environment of hospital not being able to support females in completing the CR programs. Some examples are physicians are less likely refer CR programs to women and patient‚Äôs thought against safety of the program. In situation like this from the knowledge and education that was done from holistic nursing the nurses will be able to approach the patient as they can relate to what the patient is going thought which gives more comfort and safety to patients in doing the programs.  Cultural Diversity  Part of any type of nursing includes understanding the patient's comprehension level, ability to cope, social supports, and background or base knowledge. The nurse must use this information to effectively communicate with the patient and the patient's family, to build a trusting relationship, and to comprehensively educate the patient. The ability of a holistic nurse to build a therapeutic relationship with a patient is especially important. Holistic nurses ask themselves how they can culturally care for patients through holistic assessment because holistic nurses engage in ethical practices and the treatment of all aspects of the individual. Australia has many different cultures as they are many people who were born overseas and migrated to Australia, which we can experience many cultural diversities. Culture can be defined as how people create collective beliefs and shared practices in order to make sense of their lived experiences which how concepts of language, religion and ethnicity are built in the culture. As the meaning of holistic nursing to heal the person as a whole knowing their cultural identities or backgrounds will help to reach the goal (Mariano, 2007). Understanding peoples culture may help to approach treatment correctly to the patient as it provides knowledge to nurses how patient‚Äôs view of the concept of illness and disease are to their values and identity. As in holistic approach culture, beliefs and values are essential components to achieve the goal. People‚Äôs actions to promote, maintain and restore health and healing are mainly influenced by their culture which is why knowing other cultures will assist in holistic nursing. By developing knowledge, communication, assessment skills and practices for nurses it guides to provide better experiences to patients who have diverse beliefs, values, and behaviors that respects their social, cultural and linguistic needs. As for most patients and families their decision on having treatment against illness or disease are done from cultural beliefs. This means if the nurses are unable to understand and give information relating to what they believe in the patients will most likely reject the treatment and give hardship on holistic nursing.  Holistic Education and Research  Holistic registered nurses are responsible for learning the scope of practice established in Holistic Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice(2007)and for incorporating every core value into daily practice. It is the holistic nurse's responsibility to become familiar with both conventional practices as well as alternative therapies and modalities. Through continuing education and research, the holistic nurse will remain updated on all treatment options for patients. Areas of research completed by holistic nurses includes: measurements of outcomes of holistic therapies, measurements of caring behaviors and spirituality, patient responsiveness to holistic care, and theory development in areas such as intentionality, empowerment, and several other topics. The goal of holistic nursing is treat the patient‚Äôs individual‚Äôs social, cognitive, emotional and physical problems as well as understanding their spiritual and cultural beliefs. Involving holistic nursing in the education will help future nurses to be more familiar in the terms holistic and how to approach the concept. In the education of holistic nursing all other nursing knowledge is included which once again developed through reflective practice. In holistic nursing the nurses are taught on the five core values in caring, critical thinking, holism, nursing role development and accountability. These values help the nurse to be able to focus on the health care on the clients, their families and the allied health practitioners who is also involved in patient care. Education in holistic nursing is continuous education program which will be ongoing even after graduation to improve in reaching the goal. Education on holistic nursing would be beneficial to nurses if this concept is introduced earlier as repetition of educating holistic nursing could also be the revision of it. There is different education on commutating skills and an example would be the non-verbal and verbal communication with patients. This is done to improve when would the right or wrong to use the communication skill and how powerful skills this could be.  Holistic Nurse Self-Care  Through the holistic nurse's integration of self-care, self-awareness, and self-healing practices, the holistic nurse is living the values that are taught to patients in practice. Holistic \\"nurses cannot facilitate healing unless they are in the process of healing themselves.\\" In order to provide holistic nursing to patient it is also important for nurses to take care of themselves. There are various ways which the nurses can heal, assess and care for themselves such as self-assessment, meditation, yoga, good nutrition, energy therapies, support and lifelong learning. By nurses being able achieve balance and harmony in their lives it can assist to understand how to take care of patient holistically. In Florida Atlantic University there is a program that focus on all caring aspects and recognize how to take care of others as well as on how to start evaluation on their own mind, body and spirit. Also there is Travis‚Äô Wellness Model which explores the idea of ‚Äúself-care, wellness results from an ongoing process of self-awareness, exploring options, looking within, receiving from others (education), trying out new options (growth), and constantly re-evaluating the entire process. Self-awareness and education precede personal growth and wellness‚Äù. This model of concepts shows being able to understand own status of health can benefit to patients and reach the goal of holistic nursing.  Certification  National certification for holistic nursing is regulated by the American Holistic Nurses Certification Corporation (AHNCC). There are two levels of certification: one for nurses holding a bachelor's degree and one for nurses holding a master's degree. Accreditation through the AHNCC is approved by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC).

It is best used with either warm or cool colors, creating a look that has a certain temperature as well as proper color harmony. While this is true, the scheme also lacks contrast and is less vibrant than complementary schemes. Analogous color differ depending on the color wheel used. For example, by some definitions, it would be impossible to use Goethe's color wheel for analogous colors, because they do not share a common color, such as blue-green. If you wanted to use the analogous colors blue, blue-green, and green with Boutet's color wheel on the left, you wouldn't be able.analogous def.

High-key analogous High-key color schemes have a lighter value, having white added to them or water in the case of watercolors. These have a more pastel-like look to them. Having a high-key analogous color scheme can give a piece a stimulating shimmer that pleases the eye, making everything seem the same color at first until approach. The colors are pure and aren't affected by their complements which grab attention. This was commonly used in impressionism by artists such as Monet, Pissarro, and Degas. Pierre Bonnard has also been noted for using it.

As colonel leading the 1st Virginia Infantry Regiment, he was severely wounded at the Battle of Blackburn's Ford on July 18, 1861 and was incapacitated for further field service. Thereafter, he served as an aide-de-camp, first to General Joseph E. Johnston and then to Lieutenant General James Longstreet, a judge advocate general on court martial duty and a brigade commander of Virginia Reserves (local defense forces) in the Department of Richmond. He was a merchant and Virginia militia officer before the war and an insurance agent after the conflict. Early life Patrick T.

Along with his wife and four children, he owned five female slaves. American Civil War After the Virginia secession convention effectively removed Virginia from the Union even before the ratification vote of the people, Patrick T. Moore entered Virginia state militia service as colonel of the 1st Virginia Militia Regiment on April 21, 1861. He became colonel of the 1st Virginia Infantry of the Virginia Provisional Army on June 15, 1861. After the Virginia units were formally transferred to the Confederate States Army service he became colonel of the 1st Virginia Infantry Regiment on July 1, 1861. Moore received a head wound at the Battle of Blackburn's Ford, Virginia on July 18, 1861, three days before the main Battle of First Bull Run (First Manassas), which incapacitated him for further field duty.Warner, 1959, p. 220 states that Moore led his regiment at \\"First Manassas\\" and Boatner, 1988, p. 564 and Wert, 1986, p. 508 state that Moore led his regiment at \\"First Bull Run.\\" Sifakis, 1988, p. 454 states: \\"While most accounts report him as being wounded at the head of his regiment at 1st Bull Run he was in fact wounded three days earlier at Blackburn's Ford along the same creek.\\" Eicher, 2001, p. 395, agrees with Sifakis. Moore served as aide-de-camp to General Joseph E. Johnston between October 1861 and May 31, 1862 and, after Johnston was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines, as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General James Longstreet between May 31, 1861 and July 1862. Moore's regiment had been in Longstreet's brigade during the First Bull Run Campaign. In December 1862, Moore was appointed judge advocate general for the Confederate Trans-Allegheny Department and began two years of court martial duty. On April 28, 1863, he was appointed colonel, CSA, and judge advocate general. In January 1864, he became judge advocate general for the Department of Richmond. From May 18, 1864 to December 1864, he was a brigade commander of the Reserve Forces of Virginia, which he helped organize under the direction of Brigadier General James L. Kemper. On September 20, 1864, Moore was promoted to brigadier general. Between December 1864 and April 1865, he was in command of Brigade 1 of the Virginia Reserve Forces (local defense troops) in the Department of Richmond. Moore apparently did not evacuate Richmond with the brigade because he was not captured with Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell's local defense forces at the Battle of Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865 and he was not paroled at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865 or the days immediately thereafter. He was later paroled at Manchester, Virginia, now part of Richmond, Virginia, on April 30, 1865. He was pardoned on June 14, 1865. Aftermath Moore became an insurance agent at Richmond, Virginia after the war. Patrick T. Moore died on February 19, 1883 at Richmond Virginia. He is buried at Shockoe Hill Cemetery, Richmond.

Life and work  Jakob Edelstein was born into a devout Ashkenazi family in Horodenka at that time in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, nowadays in the Ivano- Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine. His parents were Motl and Mattil Edelstein, he had a sister called Dora. During World War I, the family fled Horodenka in 1915 to Brno in Moravia to avoid the Russian army, that organised a pogrom against the Jewish people of the town, nine Jews were hanged in the main street of Horodenka. When his family returned after the war to Horodenka, Jakob stayed in Brno to finish his studies at a business school. After his graduation he left Brno for Teplitz in northern Bohemia to work as a traveling salesman. Edelstein became a fierce member of the Poale Zion movement and an activist in the Social Democrat Party. In 1927 he left the Party and was for two years only active in the P≈ô√°tel√© p≈ô√≠rody, a (social democrat movement of nature friends). From 1926 Edelstein was involved in the Hechalutz (the pioneer), a Zionist youth organisation and in World War II a resistance movement, later he worked at their head office. Edelstein joined in 1929 the Histadrut, an organisation of trade unions for and later in Israel. Jakob Edelstein married in 1931 and left Teplitz with his bride Miriam for Prague to work for the Pal√§stina-Amt (Palestine Office of the Zionist movement). Beginning 1933 he acted as head of that office, he remained in this position until the office was closed right before the outbreak of the War. In 1937 he was for several months very active for the Keren Hayesod (a fund raising organisation) in Jerusalem. Before the war Edelstein and his family had the opportunity and the documents for immigration to Eretz Israel, they planned to get to Kibbutz Givat Haim, but Edelstein chose to stay in Czechoslovakia and with his community.  World War II  On 15 March 1939, Germany annexed what was left of Czechoslovakia and established the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Edelstein called for the Zionist leaders to head the Jewish community, and became the liaison between the Jewish community and the SS to deal with Jewish emigration. For this purpose Edelstein travelled, with permission of the Gestapo, between 1939 and 1941 abroad to Bratislava, Vienna, Berlin, Trieste and Genoa. Edelstein and his substitute Otto Zucker visited England and the British Mandate for Palestine in 1938 to help facilitate the evacuation of Jewish refugees, his wife was ordered to stay in Czechoslovakia, thus forcing him to return home. In 1940 Edelstein went to Trieste in order to evacuate Czechoslovak Jews. In March 1941 he and his associate Richard Friedmann were commanded by the SS to instruct the chairmen of the Jewish Council in Amsterdam, Abraham Asscher and David Cohen to establish an administrative apparatus between the counsel and the \\"Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Amsterdam\\" (the only one in Western Europe), like the Central Office in Prague. On 18 October 1939 Edelstein, Friedmann and another thousand Jewish men were, due to the so-called Nisko-und-Lublin-Plan, deported from Ostrava to Nisko in the Lublin reservation, a concentration camp in the General Government. After the Nisko Plan was dissolved, for pragmatic reasons, Edelstein returned to Prague in November 1939. On 4 December 1941, by order of the head of the \\"Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Prague\\" SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer (major) Hans G√ºnther, Edelstein and his family were deported to Theresienstadt. They were among transport Stab, ƒç. The camp commandant SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer Siegfried Seidl designated him as the first Juden√§ltester (Jewish Elder) of the Jewish Council of Elders in the ghetto. Edelstein and his associates were determined to prevent further deportations to the East by organizing a self-sustaining, productive community that the Germans would find indispensable to their war effort.\\"\\" (Jewish work to save Jewish lives), was the idea behind Edelsteins policy. In January 1943 Edelstein was replaced as Juden√§ltester by Paul Eppstein and became his first substitute. Death Block 11 At a count in the ghetto on 9 November 1943 a difference of 55 Jews between the registered and the actual number of inmates appeared. Edelstein was accused of aiding the escape of inmates and was arrested on November 11, 1943. On 15 December 1943, Edelstein was deported to the Auschwitz I concentration camp, where he was kept isolated in Block 11 for half a year. He was deported on Transport Dr. His wife, his son, and his mother in law were sent to the Theresienstadt family camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Biib. The family was reunited on 20 June 1944. Jakob Edelstein had to watch the murder of first his mother in law then his wife Miriam and his twelve-year-old son Ariel before he was shot to death in the crematorium of the gas chamber. In June 1947, on the three-year yahrzeit of Yacov Edelstein's death in Auschwitz, Max Brod wrote: \\"And so a Jewish hero left this world, a man who up to the end did everything he possibly could and never gave up.

Like its wooden predecessor, the massive stone structure was used for everything from lectures to dances ‚Äì even boxing matches were held within its hallowed walls. However, by 1963, the revered old hall was showing its age and all civic offices were moved to the Old Post Office building.

The route originally continued as New York State Route 2 (not related to the current Route 2 near Albany). PA 3 The original Pennsylvania Route 3 was the designation for the William Penn Highway running from Hanover Township to Easton. After its decommissioning in 1930, PA 3 was renumbered in several areas to extend active routes, including US 22 from the WV/PA state line to Harrisburg, PA 60 from Robinson Township to Pittsburgh, US 322 from Harrisburg to Hershey, US 422 from Hershey to Wyomissing, US 422 Business from Wyomissing to Reading, US 222 Business from Reading to Laureldale, US 222 from Laureldale to Dorneyville (except the Kutztown and Trexlertown/Wescosville bypasses), and PA 222 from Dorneyville to Allentown.

In the 1928 renumbering, PA 10 extended north on the current segment of US 219 to New York, replacing part of PA 6. The route number was reactivated in 1956 and applied to the route now aligned through Chester, Lancaster, and Berks Counties.

PA 178, designated in 1961 to replace PA 79, was decommissioned in 1983.Pennsylvania Highways - Pennsylvania Route 178 PA 180 Pennsylvania Route 180 was a state highway located in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties in Pennsylvania. The western terminus was at PA 380 in Penn Hills. The eastern terminus was at PA 381 near Kregar. In 1961, the route was renumbered PA 130. PA 181 The original Pennsylvania Route 181 ran for approximately 3 miles along the Somerset County side of the Youghiogheny River from the MD/PA state line to U.S. 40 in Addison Township. In 1944, the Youghiogheny River Lake by formed by damming its river upstream in nearby Confluence. This widened the river from Confluence to the state line, sinking the designated PA 181 road in the process and calling for its decommissioning by 1946. PA 181 was reactivated and assigned to its current York County alignment in 1961. PA 186 In 1936, the segment of PA 180 in Allegheny County from its western terminus at PA 80 (now PA 380) in Penn Hills to Tri-Boro Avenue (now Tri-Boro Expressway) in Turtle Creek was renumbered Pennsylvania Route 186. Five years later, PA 186 was decommissioned and renumbered back to PA 180. PA 189 Pennsylvania Route 189 in Erie County (a/k/a Hare Creek Road) was the designation for what became an alignment of PA 426 (southern segment) from U.S. 6 in Corry to the PA/NY state line in Wayne Township. PA 199 The original Pennsylvania Route 199 was the designation for the segment of Asbury Road from US 20 north to the intersection of PA 5 and PA 5 Alt. in Millcreek Township, Erie County just outside Erie. The route was first designated in 1928 between US 20 and PA 99 (now PA 5) along an unpaved road. The entire length of PA 199 was paved in the 1930s. PA 199 was decommissioned in the 1960s and reactivated in 1974 to its current alignment in Bradford County. PA 202 Pennsylvania Route 202 was the designation for what became PA 702 (now PA 512) between Wind Gap and Bangor. PA 215 The original Pennsylvania Route 215 ran from PA 940 in Tobyhanna Township/Monroe County to PA 315 in Dupont/Luzerne County. PA 215 was decommissioned in 1946 and reactivated in 1962 to its current alignment in Erie County. PA 218 The original Pennsylvania Route 218 was a short-lived Lawrence/Mercer County route that ran from the intersection of PA 18 and PA 318 West Middlesex to PA 18 in New Wilmington. Less than a year after its commissioning, the entire route was decommissioned and renumbered as PA 278 (described below). PA 218 was reactivated in 1936 to its current 13-mile alignment in Greene County. PA 221 Before the current Pennsylvania Route 221 was commissioned in 1936, a short 1 1/2 mile segment between then-PA 121 and PA 88 in Dunkard Township/Greene County was originally assigned that route number as early as 1930. From 1936 to the original route's decommissioning in 1946, there were two separate PA 221 designations with a gap of 21 miles between them. The decommissioned segment is now known as Holbert Stretch Road. PA 229 Pennsylvania Route 229 was the designation for Cedar Crest Boulevard between Walbert Avenue (US 309/PA 29) in Wennersville and Chestnut Street (PA 29) in Emmaus. PA 237 Pennsylvania Route 237 ran from PA 37 and PA 590 in Lackawaxen to PA 137 (now PA 434) in Shohola Township from 1928 to 1946. PA 245 Pennsylvania Route 245 (PA 245) ran from US 309 in Slatington and PA 45 in Berlinsville between 1928 and 1946. PA 256 The one-mile Pennsylvania Route 256 in Westmoreland County ran from PA 56 to PA 66 in Leechburg. PA 260 Pennsylvania Route 260 in Cambria County ran from PA 403 in Johnstown to a former alignment of U.S. 219 in Jackson Township; it was renumbered in 1960 as an extended alignment of PA 271. PA 266 Pennsylvania Route 266 started out as a 5 1/2 mile route in Fayette County, running from PA 166 near New Geneva to U.S. 119 in Smithfield. In 1950, the original PA Route 121 across the Monongahela River in Greene County was decommissioned and the segment from PA 88 in Greensboro to PA 21 in East Waynesburg was renumbered PA 266. As a result, a ferry was provided as a connector for the two designations across the Monongahela between Greensboro and New Geneva. PA 266 was decommissioned in 1955 and the route was not renumbered or realigned with any other active routes. PA 278 Pennsylvania Route 278 was originally designated in 1928 as PA 218, a 9-mile \\"L-shaped\\" Mercer/Lawrence County route that ran from the intersection of PA 18 and PA 318 in West Middlesex to PA 18 in New Wilmington. Shortly after its renumbering to PA 278 the following year, the eastern terminus was extended to U.S. 19 in Washington Township. In 1936, the western terminus was moved to U.S. 422 in Pulaski Township near the PA/OH state line, thus situating the route entirely in Lawrence County; the former segment from West Middlesex from Pulaski Township was renumbered as an alignment of PA 551. In 1959, PA 278 was decommissioned and the segment from its western terminus to PA 168 was renumbered as an realignment of current PA 208. The remaining eastern segment from PA 168 to U.S. 19 was not renumbered. PA 280 Pennsylvania Route 280 in Allegheny County ran entirely along Rodi Road from Thompson Run Road (formerly PA 503) in Wilkins Township to its northern terminus at former PA 80 (now PA 380) in Penn Hills from 1928 to its decommissioning in 1946. In 1963, the 2.10-mile segment from US 22 Business in Churchill to said northern terminus was assigned its current route, PA 791. PA 319 Pennsylvania Route 319 in Fayette County ran from the WV/PA state line in Lake Lynn to U.S. 40 in Hopwood. It was decommissioned in 1946 and the southern portion was reassigned in 1967 as its current designation of PA 857. PA 336 Pennsylvania Route 336 ran from PA 286 in Glen Campbell/Indiana County to former PA 236 near Rossiter/Jefferson County. It was one of the longer lasting former routes, having been decommissioned in 1984 and separated into four quadrant state routes. PA 359 Pennsylvania Route 359 in Armstrong County ran from PA 56 in Kiskiminetas Township to PA 66 in Manor Township. It was one of the longer lasting former routes, having been decommissioned in 1981 and reassigned as SR 2025. PA 451 Pennsylvania Route 451 ran along the northern edge of Beaver Country from the then-eastern terminus of PA 351 to PA 18 in Koppel. In 1936, PA 351 extended its eastern segment with the decommissioning of PA 451 and the opening of the last segment from Koppel to its current terminus at PA 65/PA 288 in Ellwood City. PA 458 Pennsylvania Route 458 in Mercer County started at the intersection of PA 322 and PA 58's then-western terminus in Jamestown (near the Mercer/Crawford County line) and ran for three miles westbound to the Ohio/Pennsylvania state line in Greene Township. In 1946, PA 458 was decommissioned and became the westernmost segment of PA 58. PA 466 Pennsylvania Route 466 was a Westmoreland County route that ran from PA 56/PA 356 in Allegheny Township to PA 66 in Washington Township. It was decommissioned and renumbered in 1946, extending PA 356 to its current southern terminus. PA 503 Pennsylvania Route 503 was a 6-mile Allegheny County route that ran from former PA 180 (which became concurrent with PA 993 in 1941 and is now solely PA 130) in Turtle Creek to former PA 80 (now PA 380) in Penn Hills. PA 527 Pennsylvania Route 527 in Forest County was first signed in Pleasantville. Two years later, it was moved east near the Allegheny River, running along Preacher Hill Road from McArthur Run Road to PA 127 (Fleming Hill Road) in Harmony Township. PA 543 Pennsylvania Route 543 was the designation for Progress Avenue between US 22 in Paxtang and PA 39 in Linglestown between 1928 and 1955. The route is now SR 3015. PA 566 Pennsylvania Route 566 ran through Armstrong County from the intersection of the PA 56/PA 66 concurrency/split in North Vandergrift to PA 66 in Bethel Township. In 1938, PA 566 was replaced with its current designation of Alternate PA 66 which was then extended into Westmoreland County to the current southern terminus at its parent route in Washington Township. PA 582 Pennsylvania Route 582 in Indiana County ran from U.S. 22/U.S. 119 in Blairsville to U.S. 119 in Black Lick. PA 602 Pennsylvania Route 602 in Susquehanna County ran from U.S. 11 in Hallstead to the PA/NY state line six miles north. This was renumbered in 1946 as a realignment of PA 70. When PA 70 was renumbered PA 171 in 1961, the northern terminus was truncated from the state line to its current location at I-81 in Great Bend. The decommissioned segment, which was the former PA 602, was renumbered as Quadrant SR 1033. PA 651 Pennsylvania Route 651 in Beaver County started at the OH/PA state line in Darlington Township and ran eastbound through Darlington Borough, back into the township of the same name, Big Beaver and to its eastern terminus at PA 18 in Homewood. In 1936, PA 168 was extended northbound from its previous terminus in Beaver. As a result, 1.2 miles of its new designation ran concurrently with PA 651 from Market Street in Darlington Borough to Ashwood Road in Big Beaver. PA 672 Pennsylvania Route 672 was a state highway located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The southern terminus was at PA 72 in Lancaster. The northern terminus was at PA 72 in Manheim. The road is now known as its name, Fruitville Pike and is signed as Quadrant Route 4011. PA 680 Pennsylvania Route 680 was the original designation of current PA 217. PA 680 originally terminated southbound at U.S. 22 in Blairsville/Indiana County; it was extended in 1936 to its current southern terminus at U.S. 30 on the border of Unity and Derry Townships in Westmoreland County. In 1961, PA 680 was renumbered as PA 217 to avoid numerical duplication with I-680 in Philadelphia. Despite this, I-680 was changed to I-676 in 1964 when its parent I-80S (Pennsylvania Turnpike) was changed to I-76. PA 692 Pennsylvania Route 692 was the designation for what became PA 70 (now PA 171) between Oakland and Great Bend. PA 702 Pennsylvania Route 702 was the designation for what became PA 512 between Wind Gap and Bangor. PA 709 Pennsylvania Route 709 was the designation for the approach of the Riverton‚ÄìBelvidere Bridge in Riverton. PA 746 Pennsylvania Route 746 was the designation for what became PA 646 between Aiken and Rew. PA 752 Pennsylvania Route 752 was a state highway located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The route connected PA 63 to US 611 in Horsham between 1930 and 1940. The route is today known as Dresher Road. PA 763 Pennsylvania Route 763 was a route that ran from PA 263 in Hatboro southeast to PA 232 in Lower Moreland Township in Montgomery County, following Byberry Road. It was created by 1930 with the designation removed by 1940. PA 766 Running entirely in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Route 766 was designated on the entire stretch of Oakford Park Road. Its southern terminus was at former PA 180 (now PA 130, Harrison Avenue) in Jeannette and its northern terminus at former PA 66 (now Business PA 66, Sheridan Road) in Greensburg. PA 780 Pennsylvania Route 780 was one of the few state numbers to have two active routes in two different counties at the same time. The original PA 780 was commissioned in 1930; it was located in Clinton County and ran from a segment of U.S. 220 that was later \\"swapped\\" with parallel PA 64 in Lamar to PA 880 in Loganton. Six years later, PA 780's second (and currently active) designation was assigned in Westmoreland County. After the original PA 780 was decommissioned in 1967, the segment from the eastern terminus at North Mill Road to Narrows Road was renumbered as a realignment of PA 880. PA 790 Pennsylvania Route 790 ran from PA 290 near Hemlock Grove to PA 507 in Greentown between 1930 and 1946. PA 802 Pennsylvania Route 802 in Allegheny County ran from the former concurrency of PA 28/PA 519 (now PA 50, Washington Avenue) in Heidelberg to the former multiple concurrency of US 19/US 22/US 30/PA 28/PA 51/PA 88 (now PA 60, South Main Street) in the West End neighborhood of Pittsburgh. In 1961, with the opening of a new interchange to the Penn Lincoln Parkway in Green Tree, the former PA 802 segment from the intersection of Greentree and Cochran Roads to the intersection of Greentree Road and Mansfield Avenue was reassigned as a part of the new PA 121, having been decommissioned from its original route in 1950. PA 805 Pennsylvania Route 805 in Allegheny County was a \\"horseshoe\\" route that began and ended at two different points of former PA 8/PA 28 (now solely PA 28). From the northern terminus, PA 805 ran up through Millvale, Shaler Township and Ross Township, then wound back down through the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Summer Hill, Northview Heights, Spring Hill/City View and East Allegheny to its southern terminus. PA 808 Pennsylvania Route 808 in Allegheny County ran for 2 short miles from the original PA 28 (Main Street) in Sharpsburg to former PA 836 (Dorseyville Road) in O'Hara Township. PA 823 Pennsylvania Route 823 ran from Big Shanty to US 219 in Lewis Run between 1929 and 1932. PA 825 Pennsylvania Route 825 was the designation for what became PA 729 in Janesville. PA 835 Pennsylvania Route 835 in Allegheny County ran from PA 8 in Hampton Township to PA 910 in West Deer Township. PA 836 Pennsylvania Route 836 in Allegheny County was a \\"U-shaped\\" route located in Pittsburgh's North Hills. Beginning on Saxonburg Boulevard at PA 910 in Indiana Township, the route ran south through Fox Chapel, O'Hara Township, Shaler Township and Etna. Crossing over PA 8 in Etna, PA 836 continued northbound back into Shaler Township and ran concurrently with Mount Royal Boulevard to its northern terminus at PA 8 in Hampton Township. PA 844 The original Pennsylvania Route 844 was located in Indiana County and ran from former PA 80 (now PA 286) to West Lebanon Road in Saltsburg. It was decommissioned in 1946 and the route number was reactivated to its current Washington County location in 1964. PA 854 Pennsylvania Route 854 in Clarion County ran from PA 861 in Leatherwood to U.S. 322 near Elk City. It was one of the longer lasting former routes, having been decommissioned in 1984. PA 855 Pennsylvania Route 855 in Butler County ran from the borough of Mars to PA 68 in Evans City. It was decommissioned in 1946 and later assigned as quadrant SR 3015 (Mars-Evans City Road). A local attraction along this route was feeding tame fish in a small pond near a gas station in Callery.*Parisi, Larry D., Butler County, Arcadia Publishing, 2004, ., pp. 116. PA 856 Pennsylvania Route 856 (PA 856) was a state route that ran from PA 65 in Freedom in Beaver County southeast to another intersection with PA 65 in Emsworth in Allegheny County. PA 856 headed east from PA 65 in Freedom and had an intersection with PA 989 before it left Beaver County for Allegheny County. At this point, the route curved southeast and then south before it passed through Franklin Park. PA 856 continued south to its end at PA 65 in Emsworth. The route was designated in 1928 to run from PA 857 (now PA 65) in Freedom east to Knob along an unpaved road. PA 856 was paved by 1930. In the 1930s, the route was extended from Knob southeast to PA 88 (now PA 65) in Emsworth, with a portion of road north of Emsworth replacing PA 989. PA 856 was decommissioned in 1976 due to the completion of the parallel I-79 in the area. The state continued to maintain the former alignment of PA 856. Two years after the route was decommissioned, local residents complained about lack of snow removal and felt that PennDOT had abandoned the road when they removed the PA 856 designation. However, the state reminded the residents that they still maintain the road and that snow removal along the former route was secondary to more important routes, in addition to suggesting local municipalities can take over snow removal. PA 862 Pennsylvania Route 862 in Armstrong County ran from Pine Township's unincorporated community of Templeton to PA 28/PA 66 in Boggs Township. PA 877 Pennsylvania Route 877 in Lower Turkeyfoot Township/Somerset County ran from a former alignment of PA 53 (now PA 281) to an unmarked road. PA 881 PA Routes 881-886 were all situated throughout southeast Allegheny County. Only PA 885 remains active today. Pennsylvania Route 881 began at the intersection of Walnut Street and Long Run Road in Versailles and ran northbound to U.S. 30 in East Pittsburgh. After PA 881 was decommissioned in 1946, nearby PA 148 was realigned to include two separate segments of the former route. PA 882 Pennsylvania Route 882 began at the intersection of Lovedale and Mill Hill Roads (which was the PA 884 junction at the time) in Lincoln and ran north along winding roads before entering Elizabeth Township and reaching the northern terminus at PA 48 as part of a five-way intersection before the Boston Bridge (PA 883 also terminated at this intersection from the south before its decommissioning in 1932). PA 883 Pennsylvania Route 883 was situated entirely in Elizabeth Township, beginning on Broadlawn Road at PA 48 and running northbound along Broadlawn, Greenock Buena Vista and Renzie Roads before terminating back onto PA 48 at a 5-way intersection before the Boston Bridge (PA 882 also terminated at this intersection from the west). PA 884 Pennsylvania Route 884 started on Long Hollow Road at a former segment of PA 31 (now PA 136) in Elizabeth Borough (right near the Allegheny/Westmoreland County border) and ran northbound to its terminus at PA 51 in Elizabeth Borough. PA 886 Pennsylvania Route 886 began on Mill Hill Road at PA 48 and ran westbound, straddling along the border of Elizabeth Township and Lincoln before reaching the western terminus at then-PA 884 (McKeesport Road). In 1999, PA 86 in Crawford County was reassigned SR 0886 (but not as that route as the PA 86 signage has been kept intact) when Interstate 86 opened in Erie County and was given the SR 0086 designation. PA 894 Pennsylvania Route 894 (PA 894) in Dauphin County originally ran from former PA 43 (now U.S. 22) in Paxtonia to Linglestown, Pennsylvania. In 1936, PA 894's northern end was extended, terminating at PA 443 in Piketown. PA 905 Pennsylvania Route 905 (PA 905), situated in the southernmost area of Allegheny County, ran from a former alignment of PA 31 (now PA 136) in Forward Township to PA 51 in Elizabeth. PA 905 was first designated in 1928 as a short unpaved spur off PA 31 to the east of Monongahela. In 1930, the route was constructed as a concrete road serving as a shortcut between Monongahela and Elizabeth. The road connected farmland in Forward Township with Elizabeth and PA 31 and formed part of an outer beltline of Allegheny County. The PA 905 designation was removed in 1946. PA 908 Pennsylvania Route 908 (PA 894) in Allegheny County ran from Harmar to the northeastern corner of the county in Natrona Heights, beginning and ending at different points of a former (pre-Allegheny Valley Expressway) alignment of PA 28 (Freeport Road). PA 909 Pennsylvania Route 909 (PA 909) was a 6-mile state road that ran across and parallel to the Allegheny River through Oakmont, Plum, New Kensington and Lower Burrell, northeast of Pittsburgh. From its southern terminus at the Freeport Road (Old PA 28) end of the Hulton Bridge in Harmar/Allegheny County, PA 909 ran across the bridge along Hulton Road, Coxcomb Hill Road and Logan's Ferry Road and into Westmoreland County where the northern terminus at PA 366 straddles between New Kensington and Lower Burrell. Although officially decommissioned in 1946, a signpost at the intersection of Logan's Ferry and Coxcomb Hill Roads shows the latter road as ROUTE 909. Two of the Allegheny County's Belt System routes run concurrently with this former route: 40px: From the southern terminus at Freeport Road (Old PA 28) to the intersection of Hulton and Coxcomb Hill Roads 40px: From the intersection of Coxcomb Hill and Logan's Ferry Roads to the northern terminus at PA 366. PA 911 Pennsylvania Route 911 in Allegheny County ran from an old segment of PA 50 (formerly PA 28) in South Fayette Township to PA 50 (formerly PA 519) in Collier Township. PA 918 Pennsylvania Route 918 in Bedford County first ran from the MD/PA state line to PA 326 in Southampton Township. In 1936, PA 918 was truncated down to 4 1/2 miles when it was \\"swapped\\" with the segment of PA 326 from Chaneysville to PA 26. PA 930 Pennsylvania Route 930 was first commissioned for 1 1/2 miles on Galilee Road between Moravia and West Pittsburg in Beaver County; it was moved and extended to a 2-county route in 1936, running from PA 51 in Moon Township/Allegheny County to PA 168 in Ohioville/Beaver County until its decommissioning in 1946. Thirty years later, the segment of PA 51 from Narrows Run Road (now University Boulevard) in Moon Township to its then-concurrency with PA 18 in Monaca was moved to its current alignment on former PA 930. The original route on Galilee Road is now an alignment of PA 168. PA 931 Pennsylvania Route 931 (Clinton Frankfort Road) ran from PA 18 in Frankfort Springs to U.S. 30 in the Clinton neighborhood of Findlay Township and was situated along the Beaver, Washington and Allegheny County lines. PA 932 Pennsylvania Route 932 ran from US 422 in Pulaski Township/Lawrence County to PA 318 near the PA/OH state line in Shenango Township/Mercer County. This is one of the very few defunct routes that lasted longer than most that were commissioned in 1928. It was downgraded in 1985 with two SR route numbers that changed at the county line: SR 4001 in Lawrence County and SR 3001 in Mercer County. PA 933 Pennsylvania Route 933 in Cambria County was the designation for what is now the segment of PA 271 from U.S. 22 in Jackson Township to U.S. 219 in Northern Cambria. PA 945 Pennsylvania Route 945 ran from PA 402 in Smithfield Township to US 209 in Middle Smithfield Township between 1928 and 1946. PA 951 Pennsylvania Route 951 began at the concurrency of U.S. 219/U.S.322 in Luthersburg/Clearfield County and ran for 10 miles to U.S. 322 in Prescottville/Jefferson County. PA 962 Pennsylvania Route 962 in Pike County ran from U.S. 6 in Milford to the borough of Silver Spring. It was decommissioned in 1946 and was later reassigned as its current designation of quadrant SR 2001. PA 963 Pennsylvania Route 963 ran from US 6 and US 209 in Matamoras to Millrift between 1928 and 1946. PA 964 Pennsylvania Route 964 in Venango County first ran from the borough of Utica to U.S. 322 in Canal Township. In 1936, the route was extended and its southern terminus moved to a former alignment of PA 285 in Frenchcreek Township. PA 966 Pennsylvania Route 966 in Clarion County first ran from U.S. 322/PA 66 in Clarion to an unnumbered road in Miola; this was extended in 1936 to PA 36 in Scotch Hill. PA 966 was decommissioned in 1969 and renumbered as a realignment of PA 68 which was truncated the following year to its current northern terminus at U.S. 322. PA 968 Pennsylvania Route 968 in Jefferson County first ran from U.S. 322 in Brookville to an unnumbered road in Warsaw Township. It was extended in 1936 with its new northern terminus at PA 949 in Polk Township. PA 968 is one of the longer lasting routes that were assigned in 1928; it was decommissioned in 1984 and reassigned as quadrant SR 4005. PA 979 Pennsylvania Route 979 ran entirely along North Branch Road from PA 980 in Robinson Township, Washington County to PA 978 in North Fayette Township, Allegheny County. PA 990 One of the shortest state routes ever commissioned, Pennsylvania Route 990 in Allegheny County ran from then-PA 881 (East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard) to U.S. 30 in North Versailles. This road is now known as Navy- Marine Corps Way. PA 991 Pennsylvania Route 991 (Fifth Avenue) in Allegheny County ran from Westinghouse Avenue (at the junction of then-PA 881) in North Versailles to U.S. 30 in East McKeesport. After its decommissioning in 1946, PA 991 was reassigned as a realignment of current PA 148. PA 992 Pennsylvania Route 992 in Westmoreland County ran from U.S. 30 in Adamsburg to former PA 180 (now PA 130) in Harrison City PA 996 Pennsylvania Route 996 in Franklin County ran from U.S. 30 in Guilford to PA 997 in Scotland. PA 998 Pennsylvania Route 998 ran along the segment of West Canal Road from U.S. 30 northbound to PA 234 in Paradise Township/York County.

McPherson, 630 F.3d 805 (9th Cir. 2009), was heard by United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in October 2009. Plaintiff-appellee Carl Bryan was tasered by defendant-appellant Officer Brian MacPherson after being pulled over to the side of the road for failure to wear a seat belt. The case considered whether MacPherson's use of a taser during a routine traffic stop violated Bryan's Fourth Amendment rights. The majority opinion, written by Kim McLane Wardlaw, declared that the use of the taser in this situation could be considered excessive force. Richard Tallman and Consuelo Mar√≠a Callahan wrote the dissent. This case affirmed that this use of a taser could indeed be considered excessive force.Bryan v. MacPherson, 630 F.3d 805 (9th Cir. 2009). Facts In the summer of 2005, 21-year-old Carl Bryan planned to drive his brother from their cousin's home in Ventura County back to his parents‚Äô home in San Diego County. That day, due to certain events, Bryan was greatly upset. His cousin's girlfriend had accidentally taken his keys to Los Angeles and Bryan, wearing the boxers and shirt that he had slept in, had to drive there in order to pick up the keys. He then drove back to Ventura and picked up his car and brother. While traveling on the 405, Bryan was stopped by a California Highway Patrol officer and issued a speeding ticket. He began crying, moping, and removed his T-shirt to wipe his face. Bryan and his brother then continued south and crossed the Coronado Bridge at about 7:30 a.m. At that point, Officer Brian MacPherson of the Coronado Police Department stopped Bryan at an intersection where he had been stationed to enforce seatbelt regulations. Bryan had failed to buckle his seatbelt after the earlier traffic stop by the CHP officer. MacPherson approached Bryan's window and asked if he knew why he had been stopped. Bryan did not answer. MacPherson requested that Bryan turn down his radio and pull over to the curb. Bryan complied with both requests, but angrily hit the steering wheel and yelled expletives to himself in the process. MacPherson testified that he told Bryan to remain in the car, while Bryan testified he did not hear that. Standing outside of the car, approximately 20‚Äì25 feet away from MacPherson, Bryan began jumping up and down in the middle of the street with clenched fists. Bryan claimed he struck himself on his thighs because he was angry at himself. He was clad only in his boxer shorts and tennis shoes, and claimed he was yelling gibberish to himself. It was undisputed that Bryan did not verbally threaten MacPherson; however, the parties provided conflicting testimony regarding whether Bryan made any movement towards MacPherson: MacPherson testified that Bryan took ‚Äúone step‚Äù toward him, while Bryan testified he made no such advancement. Without giving any warning, MacPherson shot Bryan with his department-issued taser gun, a device designed to fire a dart up to ¬Ω inch into bare skin and deliver a 1200-volt charge. Immobilized by the electric shock, Bryan fell face first to the ground, fracturing four teeth and suffering numerous facial contusions. The physical evidence of blood on the pavement indicated Bryan fell away from Officer MacPherson, and thus was not moving toward him. He was arrested and an ambulance took him to the hospital. Bryan was charged with resisting and opposing an officer in the performance of his duties in violation of California Penal Code ¬ß 148. Bryan was tried on this violation, but following a hung jury, the state dismissed the charges. Procedural history On July 24, 2006, Bryan filed suit against Officer MacPherson, the Coronado Police Department, its police chief, and the City of Coronado for excessive force in violation of 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, a violation of California Civil code ¬ß 52.1, as well as failure to train and related causes of action. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the City of Coronado and the Coronado Police Department on the basis of qualified immunity. The District Court denied summary judgment for MacPherson on the basis that he was not entitled to qualified immunity. He filed an interlocutory appeal on the denial of summary judgement to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that he was entitled to qualified immunity because \\"the use of one single, properly- administered deployment of a non-deadly taser to subdue a person behaving as violently and irrationally as Bryan...[was] reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.‚Äù On December 28, 2009, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court. On June 18, 2010, the three-judge panel entered a superseding opinion, reversing the District's denial of summary judgement on the basis of qualified immunity, holding, inter alia that MacPherson's use of a taser did not violate clearly established Fourth Amendment rights. On November 30, 2010, the three-judge panel entered a second superseding opinion and unanimously denied the Petition for Panel Rehearing and the Petition for Rehearing En Banc. In addition, a vote on whether to rehear the case en banc failed to receive a majority of votes by the active judges. Majority opinion The majority opinion, authored by Justice Kim McLane Wardlaw, held that MacPherson applied excessive force when he used his X26 taser in dart mode to apprehend Bryan. The Court noted that Bryan was obviously and noticeably unarmed and did not resist arrest or attempt to flee. On the issue of whether Bryan made a step toward MacPherson, the Court found that the parties' conflicting testimony was a genuine dispute of material fact and, applying the standard of review, assumed Bryan's version was true and that he did not take a step toward the officer. The Court's decision reasoned that MacPherson's X26 taser (and similar devices), when used in dart mode, is considered an ‚Äúintermediate, significant level of force that must be justified by the governmental interest involved.‚Äù However, the Court ultimately concluded that MacPherson was entitled to qualified immunity from Bryan's lawsuit, as this principle hadn't been established in 2005 when the incident occurred. Dissent Implications This case effectively announced a general legal rule and the constitutional regulation of a new technology. The principle has now been established that an X26 taser and similar devices, when used in dart mode, constitute an ‚Äúintermediate, significant level of force that must be justified by the governmental interest involved.‚Äù This particular taser case is significant in that it placed the taser at a higher level of force than most law enforcement agencies and the International Association of Chiefs of Police had placed them. Some speculate that, as a result, Bryan v. MacPherson may affect police training and taserings of suspects by California police officers, and that similar challenges to taser usage will crop up in other states. The ‚Äúless intrusive means‚Äù language has never been an element of use of force analysis by the United States Supreme Court and is contrary the other United States circuits.Ryan, Jack. \\"9th Circuit Use of Force Case Law ‚Äî TASER¬Æ Case Re-visited, Bryan v. McPherson.\\" Legal & Liability Risk Management Services & Training: Law Enforcement, Jails, Insurance Pools & Risk Managers. June 2010. Web. 06 Nov. 2011. http://www.llrmi.com/articles/legal_update/taser_9th_2010.shtml. There are cases within the United States Court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit where this type of analysis has been rejected. For example, in Forrett v. Richardson, 112 F.3d 416, 420 (9th Cir. 1997), the court held that, contrary to Williams‚Äô (Williams v. Holt 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 551) exhaust-other means argument, ‚Äúthe Fourth Amendment does not require law enforcement officers to exhaust every alternative before using justifiable deadly force.‚Äù See also Deering v. Reich, 183 F.3d 645, 652-53 (7th Cir. 1999)(same). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (\\"Sixth Circuit\\") has said: \\"The fourth amendment reasonableness standard does not turn on the availability of less intrusive alternatives\\" Collins v. Nagle, 892 F.2d 489, 493 (6th Cir. 1989). The case also established that the use of a taser requires a strong government interest that this opinion indicates is ‚Äúan immediate threat‚Äù by the subject to the officer. The court found facts, which many officers would consider threatening to not qualify as an imminent threat, such as taking one step forward when the person is still twenty feet away. An officer must consider the totality of the circumstances, including whether the subject poses an immediate threat to safety, whether he is actively resisting arrest, the severity of the crime at issue, and whether he is attempting to evade seizure by flight. A takeaway from the court's analysis is that an officer's warning is important and should be done unless exigent circumstances exist. They should assess whether their warnings are clearly heard and understood and give a reasonable time for volitional compliance.Winston, Ali. \\"Ninth Circuit Says Police Tasers Must Be Used with Caution  The Informant.\\" The Informant. 1 Dec. 2010.

McPherson and the Propriety of Police Use of Tasers, 40 Golden Gate U. L. Rev. (2010), http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/ggulrev/vol40/ iss3/5. Legal criticism and praise The Volokh Conspiracy Blog's writeup is overall critical of the decision, with the argument broken down into five main points. Orin S. Kerr, the writer, said he was surprised of the opinions focus on the perspective of the driver rather than the police officer. The blog describes that while the flow makes for an ‚Äúengaging‚Äù read from a literary perspective, this manner of describing the case makes it ambiguous to determine the legality from how the facts appeared to the officer on the scene. Next, Kerr writes how the ruling on tasers is based on a limited summary judgment record, arguing that the case uses very specific facts to draw ‚Äúa general Fourth Amendment rule that going forward regulates the use of tasers.‚Äù The third criticism Kerr makes of the case is how the court dealt with whether Bryan was posing a threat to the officer. As Kerr writes, the facts make it seem as though Bryan did indeed pose a threat, which is somewhat made light of by the court. The fourth point Kerr makes is that the case overly focuses on the minor nature of the traffic violation that led to the traffic stop. Kerr argues that instead, more focus should be put on the threat the man posed to the officer, rather than what led to the situation. Finally, Kerr describes how the qualified immunity analysis was ‚Äúfairly sparse,‚Äù stating that such a standard is extremely hard to gauge and overly general to use to interpret the case.Kerr, Orin S. ‚ÄúThoughts on Bryan v.

TASSC is concerned not only with the prevention of torture but also addresses its aftermath, the individual survivor, family, community, and society. In addition to creating a worldwide network of International Communities of Healing for torture survivors and their families, TASSC also seeks to influence domestic and international policy through advocacy, social action, public testimony, and targeted media campaigns. The organization monitors human rights violations in nations where TASSC members may be at risk, operates Helping Hands, a direct assistance program for survivors, and coordinates the annual United Nations International Day in Support of Torture Victims and Survivors (June 26). TASSC was founded in 1998 by Sister Dianna Ortiz, an American survivor of torture while a missionary in Guatemala. The office of TASSC is located in Washington D.C. History The Torture Abolition and Survivors Support coalition International was founded in 1998 by Sister Dianna Ortiz, a United States Roman Catholic nun of the Ursuline order. She was abducted and tortured over 24 hours on November 2, 1989, while serving as a missionary in Guatemala. After her release, she filed a civil suit against the Defense Minister of Guatemala. Sister Dianna wanted an organization based on survivors. TASSC is the only organization in the United States that is founded by torture survivors to educate and make people aware about countries where torture is practiced. In 2007, TASSC campaigned to repeal the Military Commissions Act of 2006, a law that authorized military tribunals to try enemy combatants for war crimes without permitting habeas corpus to the accused.  Programs ;Helping Hands Because torture is designed to destroy the human spirit and make people lose faith in themselves and in others, torture survivors face unique challenges as they learn to trust again. TASSC works to assist survivors in their quest to reintegrate themselves into society through the Helping Hands program. The program responds to the immediate social, medical, psychological and legal needs that survivors have as a result of torture. Helping Hands supports survivors in their asylum process, in their transition to self- sufficiency, and in their journey towards healing. It also aims to foster the re-establishment of trust in self, others, and the world. ;Truth Speakers Truth Speakers is TASSC's public speaking network. Survivors of torture speak out publicly about their experiences to promote the campaign against torture. Truth Speakers is one of TASSC's three education and advocacy programs through which it fulfills its mission to educate the public about the increased use of torture today by the United States and 150 other governments. The mission of TASSC's Truth Speakers is to educate the public about the fact that governments today use torture despite nearly every state's legal responsibilities to desist from torture under the Geneva Conventions, the Convention Against Torture, and in the United States, the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. Truth Speakers give presentations to church groups, nongovernmental organizations, community forums, advocacy groups, high school classes and universities in cities across the United States and abroad. TASSC promotes public understanding of crucial facts about torture, including: that torture does not produce truth during interrogation; that torturing detainees may increase the probability of the torture of U.S. personnel when captured; and that torture brutalizes the torturer and all persons responsible for it, no matter their standing in the chain of command. The topics on which the speakers engage include issues of torture related to women's or children‚Äôs rights, refugees, slavery, impunity, economic globalization, and international law. All presentations incorporate the authentic voices of those who have survived torture and speak of it from personal experience. ;Communities of Healing Despite the Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) banning the practice of torture, the prevalence of this egregious human rights abuse persists. While many organizations and efforts are continuously brought forth to hold perpetrators of torture accountable, many do not address the needs of those most afflicted by this abuse: the survivors. Working to fill this gap, TASSC International uses the International Communities of Healing to focus specifically on the rehabilitation of survivors of torture by healing themselves through mutual support, recognition, and validation. TASSC's International Communities of Healing (ICOH) are spaces where survivors gather and work together to help each other heal. Community self-empowerment is an important part of overcoming the experience of torture. TASSC provides a forum to support that process through the International Communities of Healing. Communities of Healing has ten locations inside of the United States, and eight in other countries, including Argentina, Canada and Mexico.

There are few survivals of ancient Greek and Roman furniture, but a number of images in reliefs, painted pottery and other media. It was normally made of wood, but expensive examples were often fitted with metalwork elements, which have a better chance of survival. The styles were generally rather light and elegant in upper-class furniture, and by modern standards apparently not heavily upholstered. Some items entirely in metal, such as lampstands, braziers and stands for sacrifice, have survived, and some covered by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius have either been carbonized or left hollows in the volcanic rock that can be used as moulds for plaster of Paris, allowing a clear idea of their original form. The rich had tables and chairs supported by marble, and some of these have survived. Wicker was widely used for armchairs. Greek furniture Ancient Greek furniture was typically constructed out of wood, though it might also be made of stone or metal, such as bronze, iron, gold and silver. Little wood survives from ancient Greece, though varieties mentioned in texts concerning Greece and Rome include maple, oak, beech, yew, and willow.G.M.A. Richter, The Furniture of the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans (London: Phaidon, 1966), 122. First published in 1926 with an updated version in 1966. Pieces were assembled using mortise-and-tenon joinery, held together with lashings, pegs, metal nails, and glue. Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.Richter, 125. Similarly, furniture could be veneered with expensive types of wood in order to make the object appear more costly,Richter, 125-126. though classical furniture was often pared down in comparison to objects attested in the East, or those from earlier periods in Greece.Stephanus T. A. M. Mols, Wooden Furniture in Herculaneum: Form, Technique and Function, in vol. 2 of Circumvesuviana (Amsterdam: Gieben, 1999), 10. These relatively simple varieties of furniture may be connected to ancient Greek sumptuary laws. The effects of these laws on craftsmen are discussed by Alison Burford in Craftsmen in Greek and Roman Society (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1972), 146. Extensive research was done on the forms of Greek furniture by Gisela Richter, who utilized a typological approach based primarily on illustrated examples depicted in Greek art, and it is from Richter‚Äôs account that the main types can be delineated.See section on ‚ÄúGreek Furniture‚Äù in Richter, 13-84, in which the author describes Greek furniture and its typology. Greek seating Block IV from the east frieze of the Parthenon, with images of seated gods, ca. 447‚Äì433 BCE. The modern word ‚Äúthrone‚Äù is derived from the ancient Greek thronos (Greek singular: Œ∏œÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.Richter, 13. The colossal chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia, constructed by Phidias and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to Pausanias.Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff. Less extravagant though more influential in later periods is the klismos (Greek singular: Œ∫ŒªŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ), an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design. A fine example is shown on the grave stele of Hegeso, dating to the late fifth century BCE.Linda Maria Gigante, ‚ÄúFunerary Art,‚Äù in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Vol. 1, ed. Michael Gagarin and Elaine Fantham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 246. As with earlier furniture from the east, the klismos and thronos could be accompanied by footstools.Richter, 49. There are three types of footstools outlined by Richter ‚Äì those with plain straight legs, those with curved legs, and those shaped like boxes that would have sat directly on the ground.Richter, 50-51. The most common form of Greek seat was the backless stool, which must have been found in every Greek home. These were apparently known as diphroi (Greek singular: Œ¥ŒØœÜœÅŒøœÇ), and were easily portable.E. Guhl, and W. Koner, Everyday Life in Greek and Roman Times (New York: Crescent, 1989), 133. The Parthenon frieze displays numerous examples, upon which the gods are seated.Elizabeth Simpson, ‚ÄúFurniture,‚Äù in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Vol. 1, ed. Michael Gagarin and Elaine Fantham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 254. Several fragments of a stool were discovered in a fourth-century BCE. tomb in Thessaloniki, including two of the legs and four transverse stretchers. Once made of wood and covered in silver foil, all that remains of this piece are the parts made of precious metal.Dimitra Andrianou, The Furniture and Furnishings of Ancient Greek Houses and Tombs (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009) 28-29, figure 6a. A Greek symposium The folding stool, known as the diphros okladias (Greek singular: Œ¥ŒØœÜœÅŒøœÇ ·ΩÄŒ∫ŒªŒ±Œ¥ŒØŒ±œÇ), was practical and portable. The Greek folding stool survives in numerous depictions, indicating its popularity in the Archaic and Classical periods; the type may have been derived from earlier Minoan and Mycenaean examples, which in turn were likely based on Egyptian models.Ole Wanscher, Sella Curulis: The Folding Stool, an Ancient Symbol of Dignity (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1980), 83. Greek folding stools might have plain straight legs or curved legs that typically ended in animal feet.Richter, 43. Klinai Relief with Persephone A couch or kline (Greek: Œ∫ŒªŒØŒΩŒ∑) was a form used in Greece as early as the late seventh century B.C.E.Simpson, 253. The kline was rectangular and supported on four legs, two of which could be longer than the other, providing support for an armrest or headboard. Three types are distinguished by Richter ‚Äì those with animal legs, those with ‚Äúturned‚Äù legs, and those with ‚Äúrectangular‚Äù legs, although this terminology is somewhat problematic.Richter, 54; Richter defines ‚Äúturned‚Äù (as in lathe-turned) legs on page 19 as being tripartite, with a middle ‚Äúlozenge- shaped‚Äù portion capped by conical, ‚Äúflaring‚Äù pieces at either end. This terminology is problematic in that it implies woodworking techniques, while the ‚Äúturned‚Äù leg could have been executed in other materials, such as stone, metal, or ivory. Richter defines ‚Äúrectangular‚Äù legs on page 23 as those that are ‚Äústraight‚Äù though these can be curved and footed and often decorated with palettes and volutes. The fabric would have been draped over the woven platform of the couch, and cushions would have been placed against the arm or headrest, making the Greek couch an item well suited for a symposium gathering. The foot of a bronze bed discovered in situ in the House of the Seals at Delos provides an indication of how the ‚Äúturned‚Äù legs of a kline might have appeared.Andrianou, 36. Numerous images of klinai are displayed on vases, topped by layers of intricately woven fabrics and pillows. These furnishings would have been made of leather, wool, or linen, though silk could also have been used. Stuffing for pillows, cushions, and beds could have been made of wool, feathers, leaves, or hay.Richter, 117. Greek tables In general, Greek tables (Greek singular: œÑœÅŒ¨œÄŒµŒ∂Œ±, œÑœÅ·º∞œÄŒøœÖœÇ, œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ¨œÄŒøœÖœÇ, œÜŒ¨œÑŒΩŒ∑, ·Ω≤ŒªŒµ√≥œÇ) were low and often appear in depictions alongside klinai and could perhaps fit underneath.Richter, 63. The most common type of Greek table had a rectangular top supported on three legs, though numerous configurations exist. Tables could have circular tops, and four legs or even one central leg instead of three. Tables in ancient Greece were used mostly for dining purposes ‚Äì in depictions of banquets, it appears as though each participant would have utilized a single table, rather than a collective use of a larger piece. On such occasions, tables would have been moved according to one's needs.Richter, 66. Tables also would have figured prominently in religious contexts, as indicated in vase paintings. One example by the Chicago Painter from The Art Institute of Chicago, dating to around 450 B.C.E., shows an image of three women performing a Dionysian ritual, in which a table functions as an appropriate place to rest a kantharos ‚Äì a wine vessel associated with Dionysus.Chicago Painter, stamnos, ca. 450 B.C.E. The Art Institute of Chicago, 1889.22. Other images indicate that tables could range in style from the highly ornate to the relatively unadorned. Roman furniture Carbonized bed from the Casa del Tramezzo di Legno in Herculaneum To a large extent, the types and styles of ancient Roman furniture followed those of their Classical and Hellenistic Greek predecessors. Because of this it is difficult to differentiate Roman forms from earlier Hellenistic ones in many cases. Gisela Richter‚Äôs typological approach is useful in tracing developments of Greek furniture into Roman expressions.Richter, 97-116. Knowledge of Roman furniture is derived mainly from depictions in frescoes and representations in sculpture, along with actual pieces of furniture, fragments, and fittings, several of which were preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79. The most well-known archaeological sites with preserved images and fragments from the eruption are Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy. There are fine examples of reconstructed Roman furniture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City as well as the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Chairs The sella, or stool or chair, was the most common type of seating in the Roman period, probably because of its easy portability. In addition, the sella in its simplest form was inexpensive to make. Both slaves and emperors used it, although those of the poor were surely plain, while the wealthy had access to precious woods, ornamented with inlay, metal fittings, ivory, and silver and gold leaf. Bronze sellae from Herculaneum were square in form and had straight legs, decorative stretchers, and a dished seat.Lucia Pirzio Biroli Stefanelli, Il bronzo dei romani: arredo e suppellettile (Rome: L‚ÄôErma\\" di Bretschneider, 1991), 140-142. The sella curulis, or folding stool, was an important indicator of power in the Roman period.Wanscher, 121. There were sellae resembling both stools and chairs that folded in a scissor fashion to facilitate transport.Roger B. Ulrich, Roman Woodworking (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007), 221. Reconstructed triclinium or dining room, with three klinai or couches Metal brazier with satyrs, from Pompei The Roman cathedra was a chair with a back, although there is disagreement as to the exact meaning of the Latin term. Richter defines the cathedra as a later version of the Greek klismos, which she says was never as popular as its Greek predecessor.Richter, 101; Ulrich, 215. A. T. Croom, however, considers the cathedra to be a high-backed wickerwork chair that was typically associated with women. They have also been seen being used as early school teachers, pupils would sit around him in this chair while he taught. It showed who held the seat of power in the classroom.A. T. Croom, Roman Furniture (Stroud, Gloucestershire, Great Britain: Tempus, 2007), 116. As with Greek furniture, the names of various Roman types as found in texts cannot always be associated with known furniture forms with certainty. The Latin solium is considered to be equivalent to the Greek term thronos and thus is often translated as ‚Äúthrone.‚ÄùRichter, 98; Ulrich, 215-216. These were like modern chairs, with backs and arm rests. Three types of solia based on Greek prototypes are distinguished by Richter: thrones with ‚Äúturned‚Äù and ‚Äúrectangular‚Äù legs and grandiose thrones with solid sides, of which several examples remain in stone.Richter, 98-101. In addition, a type with a high back and arms, resting upon a cylindrical or conical base, is said to derive from Etruscan prototypes.Richter, 10. According to Ulrich, Pliny uses the Greek term cathedra instead of solium for wicker armchairs, 215-218. Croom, however, refers to this chair as cathedra on p. 116. Couches Few actual Roman couches survive, although sometimes the bronze fittings do, which help with the reconstruction of the original forms. While in wealthy households beds were used for sleeping in the bedrooms (lectus cubicularis), and couches for banqueting while reclining were used in the dining rooms (lectus tricliniaris), the less well off might use the same piece of furniture for both functions.Croom, 32. The two types might be used interchangeably even in richer households, and it is not always easy to differentiate between sleeping and dining furniture. The most common type of Roman bed took the form of a three-sided, open rectangular box, with the fourth (long) side of the bed open for access. While some beds were framed with boards, others had slanted structures at the ends, called fulcra, to better accommodate pillows. The fulcra of elaborate dining couches often had sumptuous decorative attachments featuring ivory, bronze, copper, gold or silver ornamentation.Ulrich, 232-233. The bench, or subsellium, was an elongated stool for two or more users. Benches were considered to be ‚Äúseats of the humble,‚Äù and were used in peasant houses, farms, and bathhouses. However, they were also found in lecture halls, in the vestibules of temples, and served as the seats of senators and judges. Roman benches, like their Greek precedents, were practical for the seating of large groups of people and were common in theaters, amphitheaters, odeons and auctions.Richter, 104; Croom, 110. The scamnum, related to the subsellium but smaller, was used as both a bench and a footstool.Ulrich, 219. Tables Types of Roman tables include the abacus and the mensa, which are distinguished from one another in Latin texts. The term abacus might be used for utilitarian tables, such as those for making shoes or kneading dough, as well as high-status tables, such as sideboards for the display of silver.Ulrich, 223-224. A low, three-legged table, thought to represent the mensa delphica, was often depicted next to reclining banqueters in Roman paintings. This table has a round tabletop supported by three legs configured like those of a tripod.Ulrich, 225. Several wooden tables of this type were recovered from Herculaneum. Surviving Examples The most important source for wooden furniture of the Roman period is the collection of carbonized furniture from Herculaneum. While the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 C.E. was tremendously destructive to the region, the hot liquid lava that engulfed the town of Herculaneum ultimately preserved the wooden furniture, shelves, doors, and shutters in carbonized form.Mols, 1. Their preservation, however, is imperiled, as some of the pieces remain in situ in their houses and shops, encased in unprotected glass or entirely open and accessible. Upon excavation, much of the furniture was conserved with paraffin wax mixed with carbon powder, which coats the wood and obscures important details such as decorations and joinery. It is now impossible to remove the wax coating without further damaging the furniture. Several wooden pieces were found with bone and metal fittings.Mols, 19. Wooden shelving and racks are found in shops and kitchens in the Vesuvian sites, and one house has elaborate wooden room dividers.

The 1946 Yugoslav Constitution was the first constitution of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. It came into effect at its promulgation on January 31.  Commentary  In his address to the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, President Josip Broz Tito referred to several articles of the Constitution to demonstrate its liberal nature. > Let us take only Article 1 of the Constitution, which says: \\"The Federal > People's Republic of Yugoslavia is a federal national state of republican > structure, a community of peoples enjoying equal rights, who on the basis of > the right to self-determination, including the right to secede, have > expressed their will to live together in a federated state.\\" > There, that is how national equality is settled here, that is how it is > codified and put fully into practice. > Further, how is the question of power settled in the Constitution and in > practice in this country? > In Article 6 it is stated: \\"In the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia > all power derives from the people and belongs to the people. The people > exercise their power through the freely elected representative bodies of > state authority, from the people's committees which, from the local people's > committees up to the assemblies of the people's republics and the People's > Assembly of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia originated and > developed in the People's Liberation War against Fascism and reaction and > which are the basic achievements of that struggle.\\" > Consequently, the Constitution has only confirmed, or rather codified, what > was won during the war, that is to say the power of the people, the power of > a real people's democracy.Christman, Henry M., ed. The Essential Tito. St. > Martin's Press, 1970, p. 56  Regulations  The breakdown of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was realized by the declaration of federal organization and by that, six new nations and two autonomous regions were born. The doctrine of the three- national people was abandoned and the status of a nation was given to the Macedonians, Montenegrins and Bosnian Muslims. The second important characteristic is that it resembles the Soviet constitution of 1936 (AKA \\"The Stalin Constitution\\"). The constitution contained regulations about the dominant position of state property, organization of authority on the principle of unity of authority and dichotomous division of all state authority on state authorities and state administration. The division of jurisdiction existed between the union state, the member republics, the territorial administration and local administration. On the same level of authority existed the principle of authority union, and the vertical regulation was based on the principle of \\"democratic centralism\\", which was defined by the leading constitution maker of that time: Edvard Kardelj. That actually meant the introduction of the etatist social and centralist state regulation even side by side with the nominal federalism. Ideological, political and other forms of pluralism were excluded.  Practice  This Constitution will enable further firming of the new authorities in the country, but soon after that, the process of changing the Constitution will begin as the result of a conflict with the Soviet Union, until recently ally and model. The Yugosloven trip into Socialism will begin with Constitution changes in the years 1950 and 1952, and a major change will be made in the 1953 Yugoslav Constitution.

However, the decline of the steel sector halted area road construction, and the entire project was not completed until 1989. The road was originally named for former State Engineer C. Vance DeiCas.

The UI layer deals with the interface design of the database, while the business layer includes databases supporting business strategies.  Purposes  Databases, the collection of interconnected files on a server, storing information, may not deal with the same type of data, i.e. databases may be heterogeneous. As a result, many kinds of implementation and integration errors may occur in large database systems, which negatively affect the system's performance, reliability, consistency and security. Thus, it is important to test in order to obtain a database system which satisfies the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) of a database management system. One of the most critical layers is the data access layer, which deals with databases directly during the communication process. Database testing mainly takes place at this layer and involves testing strategies such as quality control and quality assurance of the product databases. Testing at these different layers is frequently used to maintain consistency of database systems, most commonly seen in the following examples: * Data is critical from a business point of view. Companies such as Google or Symantec, who are associated with data storage, need to have a durable and consistent database system. If database operations such as insert, delete, and update are performed without testing the database for consistency first, the company risks a crash of the entire system. * Some companies have different types of databases, and also different goals and missions. In order to achieve a level of functionality to meet said goals, they need to test their database system. * The current approach of testing may not be sufficient in which developers formally test the databases. However, this approach is not sufficiently effective since database developers are likely to slow down the testing process due to communication gaps. A separate database testing team seems advisable. * Database testing mainly deals with finding errors in the databases so as to eliminate them. This will improve the quality of the database or web-based system. * Database testing should be distinguished from strategies to deal with other problems such as database crashes, broken insertions, deletions or updates. Here, database refactoring is an evolutionary technique that may apply. Types of testings and processes Black box and white box testing in database test The figure indicates the areas of testing involved during different database testing methods, such as black-box testing and white-box testing.  Black-box  Black-box testing involves testing interfaces and the integration of the database, which includes: # Mapping of data (including metadata) # Verifying incoming data # Verifying outgoing data from query functions # Various techniques such as Cause effect graphing technique, equivalence partitioning and boundary-value analysis. With the help of these techniques, the functionality of the database can be tested thoroughly. Pros and Cons of black box testing include: Test case generation in black box testing is fairly simple. Their generation is completely independent of software development and can be done in an early stage of development. As a consequence, the programmer has better knowledge of how to design the database application and uses less time for debugging. Cost for development of black box test cases is lower than development of white box test cases. The major drawback of black box testing is that it is unknown how much of the program is being tested. Also, certain errors cannot be detected.  White-box  White-box testing mainly deals with the internal structure of the database. The specification details are hidden from the user. # It involves the testing of database triggers and logical views which are going to support database refactoring. # It performs module testing of database functions, triggers, views, SQL queries etc. # It validates database tables, data models, database schema etc. # It checks rules of Referential integrity. # It selects default table values to check on database consistency. # The techniques used in white box testing are condition coverage, decision coverage, statement coverage, cyclomatic complexity. The main advantage of white box testing in database testing is that coding errors are detected, so internal bugs in the database can be eliminated. The limitation of white box testing is that SQL statements are not covered.  The WHODATE approach  WHODATE approach for SQL statement transformation While generating test cases for database testing, the semantics of SQL statement need to be reflected in the test cases. For that purpose, a technique called WHite bOx Database Application Technique \\"(WHODATE)\\" is used. As shown in the figure, SQL statements are independently converted into GPL statements, followed by traditional white box testing to generate test cases which include SQL semantics.  Four stages  * Set Fixture * Test run * Outcome verification * Tear down A set fixture describes the initial state of the database before entering the testing. After setting fixtures, database behavior is tested for defined test cases. Depending on the outcome, test cases are either modified or kept as is. The \\"tear down\\" stage either results in terminating testing or continuing with other test cases. For successful database testing the following workflow executed by each single test is commonly executed: # Clean up the database: If the testable data is already present in the database, the database needs to be emptied. # Set up Fixture: A tool like PHPUnit will then iterate over fixtures and do insertions into the database. # Run test, Verify outcome and then Tear down: After resetting the database to empty and listing the fixtures, the test is run and the output is verified. If the output is as expected, the tear down process follows, otherwise testing is repeated.  Basic techniques  * SQL Query Analyzer is a helpful tool when using Microsoft SQL Server. * One commonly used function, \`create_input_dialog[\\"label\\"]\`, is used to validate the output with user inputs. * The design of forms for automated database testing, form front-end and back-end, is helpful to database maintenance workers. * Data load testing: ** For data load testing, knowledge about source database and destination database is required. ** Workers check the compatibility between source database and destination database using the DTS package. ** When updating the source database, workers make sure to compare it with the target database. ** Database load testing measures the capacity of the database server to handle queries as well as the response time of database server and client. * In database testing, issues such as atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability, integrity, execution of triggers, and recovery are often considered. # The setup for database testing is costly and complex to maintain because database systems are constantly changing with expected insert, delete and update operations. # Extra overhead is involved in order to determine the state of the database transactions. # After cleaning up the database, new test cases have to be designed. # An SQL generator is needed to transform SQL statements in order to include the SQL semantic into database test cases.

It came into effect on January 13, 1953. The amended 1946 constitution would remain in power until the adoption of the 1963 Yugoslav Constitution. This packet of constitutional amendments was adopted at the sixth congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. It partially separated party and state political functions and granted some civil and political rights to individuals and constituent republics. It further established legal foundations for workers' control over enterprises and expanded local government power. It established the Federal People's Assembly with two houses: a Federal Chamber, directly representing the regions, and a Chamber of Producers, representing economic enterprises and worker groups. The executive branch of the federal government (the Federal Executive Council, FEC) included only the five ministries dealing with national affairs and foreign policy. The League of Communists retained exclusive political control, based on the Leninist credo that the state bureaucracy would wither away, and that a multiparty system would only bring more cumbersome bureaucratic institutions.  Regulations  On the basis of the political and social order, social ownership on the means of production, self-producers in the economy, self-management of working people in the municipality, the city and the county and self-working people in the fields of education, culture and social services was declared. Yugoslavia was proclaimed a socialist, democratic, federal state of sovereign and equal nations. All power in the country belonged to the working people through their representatives in the various bodies, as well as directly - election, revocation of representatives, assemblies, councils and other forms of self-government, which was declared a basis for the entire organization. In the field of the representative body this was reflected in the introduction of the Council of Producers, as the home of the representatives of professions, in addition to a political home. The dichotomous principle of separation of powers was abandoned, and the Federal National Assembly was proclaimed the supreme representative of people's sovereignty and the highest authority of the federation. Until then, the highest existing executive body, the Presidium of the National Assembly of FNRJ and the Government of FNRJ were replaced with two executive authorities of the Federal People's Assembly - the President of the Republic and the Federal Executive Council (known as FEC), who were responsible for the assembly work, at least on paper.

It is an important site for waterbirds. Description The site encompasses the wetlands of the Yalgorup National Park; it lies just to the south of the Peel-Harvey IBA but is apparently used by waterbirds as a distinct wetland system. The major wetlands of the site are Lakes Clifton, Preston, Pollard, Yalgorup, Boundary, martins Tank, Hayward and Newnham. The lakes are evaporative salt lakes mainly fed by fresh groundwater and precipitation and vary up to about 4 m in depth. Median annual rainfall in the area is about 880 mm, falling mainly from May to August. Some of the lakes have a fringe by samphire, rushes and sedges, beyond which is a zone of paperbarks, with saltwater paperbark and red-eyed wattle around the hypersaline lakes. Many of the shorelines have been cleared for agriculture. The IBA is part of the Peel-Yalgorup Ramsar site.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Yalgorup. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-12-05. Birds The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports fairy terns, large numbers of hooded plovers and over 1% of the world populations of Australian shelducks, red-necked stints, banded stilts and, sometimes, musk ducks. Other birds recorded on the lakes in relatively large numbers include red-capped plovers, red-necked avocets, Pacific black ducks, little black cormorants, great crested grebes and black swans.

All the ballplayers in the game are fictional. There are many meters to use while determining whether to strike out the batter or give him an intentional walk instead. Batters also have to deal with meters that have to do with offense rather than defense. After playing each game, the player is entitled to a certain level of salary. This depends on how good the player performs out in the field.

It came into effect on April 7, 1963. The constitution was the result of beliefs of the governing structures that Yugoslav self-management relations have been sufficiently overcome in the society that it deserved a new and final constitutional definition and enthroning. The parliamentary Federal Assembly (Skup≈°tina) was divided into one general chamber, the Federal Chamber, and four chambers given specific bureaucratic responsibilities. The constitution directed that individual republics be represented only in the Chamber of Nationalities, a part of the Federal Chamber. President Josip Broz Tito retained his position as president of the federation but renounced his state position as president of the Federal Executive Council, a change that further separated party and state functions. The 1963 constitution also introduced the concept of rotation, which prohibited remaining at higher or lower level executive positions for more than two four-year mandates. Moreover, it extended human and civil rights and established constitutionally guaranteed court procedures.  Regulations  The definition of the state is characterized not only by provision that it is a federal state, but also a socialist democratic community, which was supposed to indicate the tendency towards the Marxist ideal of the withering away of the state. Public property, self-management and self-organization of working people at the micro and macro level was declared the basis of Economic planning. The right to social self-management was declared untouchable, and districts in the state (municipality, county, autonomous provinces of Serbia, Socialist Republics and the Federation itself), became socio-political communities. In the regulation yet unseen in constitutional law, the hierarchy between these units was destroyed and a system of mutual rights and obligations was introduced. The Federal Assembly was proclaimed as the highest authority of government and social self-government, and in the federal and republican assembly, in addition to the general-political council, greater workers' communities were introduced - economic, educational, cultural, social and health, organizational and political. Assemblies of the autonomous provinces could have more. President of the Republic became independent from SIV and became an autonomous authority of the federation. Constitutional Court of Yugoslavia and the constitutional courts of the member republics were introduced.  Practice  42 amendments were added to this Constitution until the adoption of the new 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. This shows that the stability of institutions was not achieved for longer terms. New amendments strengthened the position of autonomous provinces, introduced new areas of self-government and the former federal agencies have become common, instead of remaining superior.

Carbon dating indicates that the boat was constructed during the early mesolithic period between 8040 BCE and 7510 BCE. It is now in the Drents Museum in Assen, Netherlands. Description The boat is a dugout style canoe measuring long and wide. It was formed from a single Scots pine log. Marks are present in the cavity, likely formed from flint or antler tools. History Drents Museum, 2019. The boat was discovered in 1955 during the construction of the Dutch A28 motorway. The route passes south of the village of Pesse in Hoogeveen through what was a peat bog. To construct the roadbed, the peat needed to be removed, and during excavation, a crane operator came across what he believed to be a tree trunk below the surface. Local farmer Hendrik Wanders noticed the log and took it for further inspection. He gave the boat to the University of Groningen, where it was examined and freeze dried for preservation. It was later transferred to the Drents Museum, located near the discovery site. Debate A visiting Danish expert questioned whether such a small boat would be seaworthy. In 2001, a replica canoe was constructed by archaeologist Jaap Beuker and successfully paddled by a canoeist. Others theorized that the find could be another object, especially an animal feeder. Beuker noted that animals were not kept by the people from the boat's era, so it could not have been a trough. The boat is also similar in construction to prehistoric canoes found in other countries.

It came into effect on 21 February 1974. With 406 original articles, the 1974 constitution was one of the longest constitutions in the world. It added elaborate language protecting the self-management system from state interference and expanding representation of republics and provinces in all electoral and policy forums. The Constitution called the restructured Federal Assembly the highest expression of the self-management system. Accordingly, it prescribed a complex electoral procedure for that body, beginning with the local labor and political organizations. Those bodies were to elect commune-level assemblies, which then would elect assemblies at province and republic level; finally, the latter groups would elect the members of the two equal components of the Federal Assembly, the Federal Chamber and the Chamber of Republics and Provinces. Although the new constitution dealt with the codification of the socio-economic system towards the achievements of the theory of self- management socialism to a greater extent, the most controversial and historical consequences arose from the regulations of the Constitution about the state organization of Yugoslavia, which were later used as the legal basis for the breakup of Yugoslavia and differently interpreted by the warring parties during the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The new Constitution also reduced the State Presidency from twenty-three to nine members, with equal representation for each republic and province and an ex- officio position for the president of the League of Communists. The 1974 Constitution also expanded protection of individual rights and court procedures, with the all-purpose caveat that no citizen could use those freedoms to disrupt the prescribed social system. Finally, Kosovo and Vojvodina, the two constituent provinces of Serbia, received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the Serbian parliament. The Yugoslav Federal Constitution of 1974 confirmed and strengthened the principles of the Yugoslav Federal Constitution Amendments of 1971, which introduced a concept that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The constitution also proclaimed Josip Broz Tito president for life.  Background  Adoption of the Constitution was preceded by significant political events that occurred several years earlier, and that marked the beginning of the federalization of the country. First, in the summer of 1966, Aleksandar Rankoviƒá was removed from all functions, one of the closest associates of Josip Broz Tito, who was an opponent of federalization. The ideas made by Edvard Kardelj won, and thus began a gradual federalization. In 1968 and 1971 amendments were adopted to the Federal Constitution, through which Yugoslav Presidency as a collective leadership body was introduced (1971). Later that year, the republican leadership of SR Croatia was completely dismissed, which propagated their nationalistic politics. And in the autumn of next year (1972), a purge was carried out in the leadership of the SR Serbia. After all that, everything was ready for the adoption of the new Federal Constitution.  The Constitution  By the words of the Constitution, all power belongs to the \\"working class and working people\\". In terms of governmental structure, the provinces within the SR Serbia (SAP Vojvodina and SAP Kosovo) have received even greater rights than they had before. Provinces had their state and party Presidencies. Their territory could not be altered without the decision of the Provincial Assembly, provincial governments even got the right to veto decisions of the authorities in Serbia. Josip Broz Tito, president of Yugoslavia, was named President for Life of Yugoslavia, and his name was entered in the text of the Constitution. He was also the President of the Republic and President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia. After his death, all his functions would be transferred to the Presidency of Yugoslavia. During the public discussion on the proposed changes to the Constitution, Professor of the Belgrade Law School, Dr. Mihailo ƒêuriƒá was sentenced to prison after the publication of the speech in which he opposed the implementation of the planned constitutional changes. Pointing out that Yugoslavia was becoming just a geographical term, on whose soil under the disguise of consistent development of equality between nations, several independent, even conflicting national states were being established, prof. ƒêuriƒá warned that the proposed constitutional changes not only fundamentally change the character of the former state union of the Yugoslav nations, but rejects the very idea of such a state community. Stressing that if something would be left from the state, it is only because in the next phase of changes we had something to bring to an end.  Principles of the Constitution  The introductory part of the 1974 Constitution presents 10 basic principles: # Government: Proceeding from the right of every nation to self-determination, including the right to secession, Yugoslavia is defined as a federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of brotherhood and unity in achieving specific and common interest. Holders of the sovereignty of nations and nationalities are the republics and provinces within its constitutional jurisdiction. Decision-making in the federation is based on communication and mutual rights and obligations of the republics and provinces. Socio-economic relations are established as a socialist self- management system. # Socio-economic Planning: The basis of socio-economic system is social ownership on the means of production, the right of a working man to self-management and enjoying the fruits of labor, solidarity and reciprocity of rights and obligations of all social actors. Contrary to the Constitution are considered all forms of privatization of public assets, as well as \\"bureaucratic\\" or \\"technocratic\\" usurpation of resources or monopolization of decision-making. # Economic system: Public property does not have a legal title holder, the holder of property rights are neither political institutions, nor economic entities, nor citizens. Working people decide about the distribution of income, socially limited by established criteria of distribution to consumption and reproduction. Social ownership and working people are organized in basic organizations of associated labor. The economy is characterized by cash, credit and market system, the connection, self- governing communication, social compacts, work planning and development among the organizations of associated labor, self-management and socio-political organizations and communities are taken as a basis for regulatory mechanisms. Social activities like education, science, culture and health care are organized into self-governing communities that represent the connection between the organization of associated labor and public interest. The work of the self-employed in private ownership and operation of farmers shall be governed by the same principles as in organizations of associated labor. The coordinated development of the economy through financing the development of underdeveloped republics and provinces is determined as the general interest at the level of Yugoslavia. # Socialist self-governing democracy: It is defined as a specific form of the dictatorship of the proletariat which is ensured through a ban on the socio-economic and political organizations aimed at the establishment of capitalist relations. The power of working people is achieved through self-management and decision-making in the basic organizations of associated labor, self-interest communities and local communities and the delegation of representatives to the higher levels of the management bodies of self-governing organizations and the assemblies of socio- political organizations. Principles of work of all public authorities and self-management, personal responsibility, social control and replaceability office holders, the protection of constitutionality and legality are proclaimed, but the dominant role in the implementation of these principles in the framework of the Constitution is reserved for certain political organizations. Social self-protection is defined as the activity of all social actors to protect the self-governing constitutional order. The freedom of socio-political organization of working people is identified, but with the obligation to respect the framework of government socialist system dominated by the Constitution of the superior political organization. # Rights and freedom of men and citizens: are limited by the interests of socialist society. The freedom of scientific, cultural and artistic creativity is proclaimed, education is based on the principles of scientific socialism, social policy is based on overcoming the differences resulting from unequal conditions of life and work, veterans' benefits and social security are provided, protection and improvement of environment is introduced. # People's Defense is a collateral policy of peace, opposing aggression and pressure, which is an integral part of strengthening the defense capability of the country. It includes the participation of all social and political institutions and autonomous organizations at all levels in defense of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-management system. The unity of command of the armed forces is anticipated. # International relations of Yugoslavia are based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and active cooperation of equal states and nations, adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, meeting international commitments and active participation in international organizations. Yugoslavia is committed to non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, socialist internationalism, rejecting the use of force in international relations to achieve general disarmament, the right of people to self-determinate for the sake of the liberation struggle, independence and free choice of social and political organization for the protection of minority rights, equal economic relations in the world, respect of accepted norms of international law. # The role of political and trade union organizations: the League of Communists of Yugoslavia under the Constitution has the responsibility of the political activities to protect and further develop self-governing socialist relations. Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia is the widest democratic front of working people and citizens and is under the leadership of the Communist Party in order to achieve political unity and action. In its framework it is possible to discuss social issues, launch political initiatives and harmonization of opinions to determine political attitudes. The Constitution delegated functions of the Socialist Alliance include personnel matters, determining candidates for delegates and persons performing functions in the self and socio-political organizations, exercising social control over the work of the authorities and the management bodies of autonomous organizations and office holders, exercising influence over the system of public information. Voluntary union organizing is integrated into the socialist self-management relations. The union is authorized to delegate representatives to the management and organization of joint work and to socio-political organizations, to initiate and participate directly in the self-communication and social agreements. # The goal of socio-economic and political system established by the Constitution of the Yugoslav Republic is the development of the material basis of social relations and towards achieving the principle of communism: \\"From each according to ability - to each according to his needs.\\" All social actors are invited to \\"contribute to the realization of human rights and freedoms, humanizing social environment and the human personality, the strengthening of solidarity and humanity among people and respect for human dignity\\" and to build relationships between people in the direction of creating conditions for the elimination of coercion and to the awareness of common interests. # The basis of the interpretation of the Constitution and laws of the principles of socialist self-management expressed in the introduction to the Constitution of the Yugoslav Republic.  Right to self-determination Previous constitutions had granted the republics the constitutional right to self-determination, including a right to secede. In the 1974 Constitution, these rights belonged to the \\"nations of Yugoslavia.\\" At the same time, the constitution included a number of provisions that could deny the right to secede. Article 5 required the consent of all republics and provinces before the borders of Yugoslavia could be altered. Article 283 gave the Yugoslav Assembly the power to determine alterations in the state's boundaries. It was not clearly defined whether unilateral secession was possible or whether this could only be done if the federal government and all of the republics and provinces agreed to it.  The end of the Constitution  Out of all constituencies, the SR Serbia had the most comments on the state organization under the 1974 Constitution, which was natural given its territorial structure. Initially, it requested the federal government to convince the province to properly interpret the Constitution, according to which Serbia was still a sovereign republic with an appropriate degree of autonomy for its provinces. However, after Kardelj's (1979) and Tito's death (1980) it was more and more difficult to arbitrate in disputes between the republics and provinces. In the mid-1980s, the Serbian leadership was requesting amendments to the Constitution, no longer only correct interpretation. In early 1987, thanks to the efforts of the Serbian leadership, the Presidency of Yugoslavia initiated the adoption of more than 130 amendments. However, some time later, there was a conflict within the Serbian leadership. At the eight session of the Central Committee of Serbia in September 1987, the ideas of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá won, who energetically and strongly demanded the repeal of the Constitution of 1974. At the end of 1988 there was a shift of complete leadership in both provinces, and in the spring of 1989 amendments to the Constitution of Serbia were adopted, which significantly narrowed the powers and rights of the provinces. The final repeal of the constitutional provisions of 1974 in Serbia took place in September 1990, when it adopted a brand new constitution. In the meantime, the other Yugoslav republics had started removing the 1974 constitution. Slovenia first removed the prefix \\"socialist\\" from the name of the republic in March 1990, and at the same time adopted a series of amendments that removed the socialist arrangement. In Croatia, after the victory of the HDZ (Franjo Tuƒëman), adopted amendments in 1990 which also removed the prefix \\"socialist\\" and changed the republic symbols as well. In December 1990 Croatia adopted a brand new constitution. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia followed in the autumn of 1990, when the anti-communist forces removed the socialist system as well, and in Montenegro the removal was formally marked by the adoption of the new republic constitution in the autumn of 1992.

Ferguson (August 29, 1821 ‚Äì February 21, 1891) was an Oregon carpenter and architect. He built many now- historic houses and other buildings in Oregon, particularly in Salem and Astoria. He moved to Astoria in 1876. While living in Astoria, he designed and built several homes and other buildings, including the first city hall, built in 1878, and the NRHP-listed Capt. J. H. D. Gray House. His youngest son, James Ernest Ferguson, built his father's house, but Albert W. collaborated with his son on the house's design. James Ernest Ferguson later partnered with Charles Houston to found Ferguson & Houston, an Astoria architectural and construction firm. The company designed and built many area homes and other buildings, including the Old Astoria City Hall, which was designed by Emil Schacht. Albert W. Ferguson, who was already ill at the time of the house's construction, resided in the house from its completion in 1886 until his death in 1891 from inflammatory rheumatism. Another son, Edward Z. Ferguson, was living in the house at that time and continued to do so until 1910. Albert's daughter, Ada, moved into the house with her husband, John N. Griffin, in 1910 and resided there until her death in 1937. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Its title is a reference to the phrase \\"bread and circuses\\" taken from Juvenal's poem, \\"Satire X\\". In the episode, Joseph Black Moon and Reverend Nathaniel Cole travel into Cheyenne territory in hopes of a peace talk, Joseph's brother endures a native ritual, Lily Bell and Thomas Durant continue to discuss the future of the railroad construction, and Cullen Bohannon and his crewman Elam Ferguson settle their differences in a public fight. Plot In Cheyenne territory, Chief Many Horses (Wes Studi) prepares Pawnee Killer (Gerald Auger) for the Sun Dance ceremony. With long leather straps attached from his chest to a lone tree, Pawnee Killer must spend a full day staring at the sun and praying. If successful, a vision will be granted him. Pawnee Killer collapses after completing the ceremony, telling Chief Many Horses that he was blessed with a vision of the \\"great steel beast\\", adding \\"I killed it\\". Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) and Joseph (Eddie Spears) visit Chief Many Horses to ask him to come to Hell on Wheels and discuss peace. The chief will agree only if Joseph requests his presence, which Joseph does. Later, Reverend Cole's daughter, Ruth Cole (Kasha Kropinski), arrives in Hell on Wheels and informs him that her mother has died. Reverend Cole appears dismissive of his daughter and wishes to send her away, but must keep her in town as Ruth has nowhere else to go. Reverend Cole reveals that he has not seen Ruth in the last decade and there appears to be unresolved issues between the two. Back in town, Thomas Durant (Colm Meaney) emerges from his Pullman coach. Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) informs him that the workers are unhappy about not having been paid, lately. Durant orders him to only pay the walking bosses to keep the rest of the workers quiet. Later at the work site, Cullen convenes with the walking bosses to inform them of the pay situation. Elam (Common) joins the group to declare himself a walking boss of the freedmen. When thwarted, he gets upset with the situation and walks off the job, daring Cullen to make him work. A fight breaks out between them. Durant orders them to stop, announcing to the whole crew that the payroll is on its way. He proposes to Cullen and Elam that they settle their differences in a public fight that evening. Durant, meanwhile, tells Lily (Dominique McElligott) that, without her deceased husband Robert's survey maps, he will be considered a failure, and Robert won't be thought of at all. She later accuses Durant of engineering the fight to distract his workers until they can be paid. He scoffs at her opinion of him. She then decides to tell him that she has Robert's maps, which detail the route through the Rocky Mountains and beyond. Durant is excited at the news, until she declines to reveal the maps' location. \\"How much?\\" he asks. \\"What Robert is owed\\", she replies. Sean (Ben Esler) and Mickey (Phil Burke) McGinness' magic-lantern business has money trouble as well, with The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl). He cuts their tent's rope supports, collapsing their place of business. Before the arranged fight, Sean is sold \\"enough peppers to make a Mexican cry\\". Mickey helps Cullen prepare for the fight and tells him Sean has bet all their money on him. The fight begins and, at first, Cullen gets the best of Elam. However, between rounds, Psalms (Dohn Norwood) motivates Elam, comparing Cullen to a former slave master who mistreated Elam. Elam then beats Cullen down to the floor. As Mickey tries to raise Cullen, he notices Sean whisper to Psalms and slip something to him. The fight resumes. Elam lands a punch to Cullen's eyes. This staggers his opponent, blurring his vision. Elam eventually wins the fight. Outside, Sean shows Mickey a sizable wad of money. Seeing his brother's confusion, he explains that he bet everything on Elam, not Cullen. Mickey says Sean cheated, and Cullen was their only friend. Sean disagrees; money is his only friend. In the saloon, Lily sets a bucket of water at Cullen's head. He washes his eyes, then licks the residue from his fingers. He laughs at the peppery taste. The next morning, in his tent, Cullen hands out payment bags to the walking bosses. Elam enters and again identifies himself as the freedmen crew's walking boss. Cullen offers Elam his money bag, but still clutches it when Elam tries to take it. He finally releases it to him, after they stare at each other. Title reference The term \\"bread and circuses\\" is a metaphor for a superficial means of appeasement. The Roman satirist and poet Juvenal wrote the phrase in Satire X (circa 100 AD), wherein Roman politicians devise a plan, in 140 BC, to effectively win the votes of their new citizens and rise to power, by providing cheap food and entertainment, i.e., \\"bread and circuses\\". [...] iam pridem, ex quo suffragia nulli / uendimus, effudit curas; nam qui dabat olim / imperium, fasces, legiones, omnia, nunc se / continet atque duas tantum res anxius optat, / panem et circenses. [...]'' :(Juvenal, Satire 10.77‚Äì81) ... Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man, the People have abdicated our duties; for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, high civil office, legions ‚Äî everything, now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: bread and circuses. Reception Reviews for the episode were mixed. Adam Raymond of New York Magazine commented: \\"'Bread and Circuses' was all half-naked Common and half-naked Anson Mount working through hundreds of years of slavery with their fists.\\" IGN's Seth Amitin rated the episode as 6.5/10, calling it \\"a passable episode. It helped establish more character base and had some beautiful shots in there too ... The characters are there and that'll matter more over a full series. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars: \\"I'm growing more and more attached to these characters as Hell on Wheels moves along, with the combination of action and drama keeping the show from turning into a history lesson snooze fest.\\" The fifth episode was watched by 2.7 million viewers and had a 0.8 rating with the 18-49 age range.

Biography Gordon was born, probably in 1650, as the only child of Felim O'Neill of Kinard and his third wife Jean Gordon. His father was a prominent member of the O'Neill dynasty and one of the leaders of the Irish Confederation. His mother was a daughter of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, and the widow of Claud Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Strabane. His parents were both Catholic. They married in November 1649. He was a young child during the Irish Confederate Wars (1641‚Äì1653). His father was executed in 1653 after the defeat. Gordon O'Neill raised a regiment for King James II in 1689 and became a colonel in the Irish army. He saw action in Ulster, at the Battle of the Boyne, and the Battle of Aughrim. At the latter action, he was left for dead but was picked up by some Scottish Williamite officers who recognised him. He recovered from his wounds, and took his regiment to France after the Treaty of Limerick in 1692. There, it was known as the R√©giment de Charlemont. He was still alive in 1704. The 17th-century Irish poet Dermot McMurray (Irish: Diarmuid Mac Muireadhaigh) is believed to be the author of a Gaelic poem about him.

Ukrainian branches of the SPC were founded in Winnipeg, Portage la Prairie, and Nanaimo in 1907, and four more followed in early 1908. There was also an unsuccessful attempt to launch a Ukrainian Socialist Alliance within the SPC during the same period.Peter Krawchuk, The Ukrainian Socialist Movement in Canada (1907‚Äì1918), (Toronto: Progress Books, 1979), pp. 3-5). Relations with the SPC's predominantly anglophone leadership were sometimes difficult, and on some occasions Ukrainian party members accused their English comrades of chauvinism.Krawchuk, p. 12. The SPC leadership was, for its part, reluctant to sanction official networks for cultural communities in the party. In November 1909, several Ukrainian members of the SPC convened a special Socialist Convention of Canadian Ukrainians in Winnipeg. Delegates advocated for a new organization that would facilitate effective communication among Ukrainian branches of the SPC, while also threatening to withdraw from the party if the Ukrainian community's requests for autonomy were not recognized.Krawchuk, pp. 13-14. The FUSD was formally constituted shortly thereafter and held its first convention in Edmonton in August 1910. At this meeting, the party formally severed its ties to the SPC and aligned itself with the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Canada (SDPC).Krawchuk, pp. 15, 19. The FUSD fielded one candidate in the 1911 Canadian federal election: Wasil Holowacky in the Manitoba division of Selkirk.Krawchuk, p. 28. He appeared on the ballot as an independent and received 234 votes for a third- place finish.History of Federal Ridings since 1867: General Elections, 12th Parliament, Manitoba, Parliament of Canada, accessed 4 December 2011. The FUSD changed its name to the USDP in early 1914.Krawchuk, p. 42. World War I and aftermath The USDP was strongly opposed to participation in World War I, which it identified as an imperialist conflict.Krawchuk, p. 50. At a special conference in April 1915, the party passed a resolution that censured \\"all socialists who support the war in principle\\" and called for \\"the world proletariat to establish a Third Revolutionary International on the ruins of the Second International.Krawchuk, p. 56. Several party members were subsequently arrested and placed in internment camps by the Canadian government.Krawchuk, p. 58. The USDP strongly supported the February Revolution in Russia and some of its members welcomed the subsequent Bolshevik Revolution.Krawchuk, pp. 68-69, 81. The Canadian government arrested several of the USDP's leaders in 1918, and year it banned the party outright on September 25 of the same year.Krawchuk, p. 89. At the time of its prohibition, the USDP had more than two thousand members across Canada.Krawchuk, p. 91. Several members of the party's left wing later joined the Communist Party of Canada after the CPC's formation in 1921.Canada's Party of Socialism, (Toronto: Progress Books, 1982), pp. 6, 29.

Background The haunting of the Octoroon House has a history in the social morals of the 1800s. The term Octoroon is used for people in New Orleans in the 1800s that were 1/8 black, 7/8 white. These octoroons were known as Creoles of Color. They received the best education and were often very wealthy. Relationships between octoroons and elite Creoles of New Orleans was prohibited, but it was not uncommon for young men to have a strong attraction to octoroon women because of their beauty. Octoroon balls were used as a way for rich Creoles to obtain an octoroon mistress. These balls were used as a personal gain for the Creole men and the octoroon mistresses because it entitled the men to keep these beautiful women for their own and the octoroon mistresses would gain, in return, wealth, personal slaves, and the finest living arrangements. Most of the men had families aside from the octoroon mistresses and would often keep their affairs a secret. Because of their different social statuses, octoroons and Creole men were not allowed to marry. Legend of the Octoroon Mistress The legend has it that the octoroon who inhabited this house in the 1850s was named Julie. Julie was an octoroon because she had 1/8 black in her antecedents. Julie was said to be very beautiful with striking black hair and dark eyes that were said to be full of mystery. Julie met and fell in love with a very handsome and rich Frenchman. To the Frenchman Julie was just a mistress, his secret lover. But to Julie the Frenchman was much more. Julie desperately wanted to marry the Frenchman but the Frenchman repeatedly denied her request for marriage because of their social status. After months of begging the Frenchman devised a test which he thought would prove Julie's love for him. He told her that he was going to play a card game downstairs with some of his friends and while he was entertaining his guests he wanted her to strip off her clothing and wait on the rooftop for him until he was done. The Frenchman thought Julie would not take his request seriously and continued to entertain his friends. Julie was desperate to show her undeniable love for the Frenchman, so she immediately undressed and waited on the rooftop for her lover to return. Julie waited patiently in the cold and damp December air for her lover. When the Frenchman finally made his way to bed, he realized that Julie was nowhere to be found. He had not thought she took his request seriously, but he ran up to the rooftop to look for her. When he got up there, he saw her naked, frozen body in a corner, waiting patiently for him to return. Legend has it that the death of Julie put the Frenchman into a deep depression because he really loved Julie. Some also say that he died a few months later of a broken heart. The octoroon mistress is still said to haunt the house she once resided in. Some people say on a cold and damp December night you can see her figure pacing on the rooftop waiting for her lover to return. Her ghost is also said to roam the floors of the house but her presence is a friendly one. The house is now home to the Bottom of the Tea Cup Psychic Readings and many of the employees and customers claim to have had many encounters with her. They often note her as playful and energetic with many giggles being heard from room to room. The Frenchman is also said to roam the garden outside and people who have encountered him have said that his spirit seems sad.

The group made dozens of recordings of English madrigals between 1921 and 1955.Haskell, p. 115. Background and development In 1917 the bass singer Cuthbert Kelly founded a quartet of singers, having previously staged wartime concerts at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields.Pears, p. 1. In 1920 the group was augmented to six singers, the members being Flora Mann, Winifred Whelen, Lillian Berger, Steuart Wilson, Clive Carey and Cuthbert Kelly himself. The ensemble gave its first concert on 28 February at London's Aeolian Hall.Stewart, p. 66 As the music scholar Edmund Fellowes reported, the concert was a great success: \\"It was the first occasion upon which in modern times madrigals were properly interpreted on a concert platform, and it was the first appearance in public of The English Singers, though it was not till later in the year that they took that title. The audience was entranced. Here was something quite new to an English audience and they rose to it.\\" Two further concerts were arranged that year at the Aeolian Hall, and another 15 concerts were given elsewhere before the end of 1920.Stewart, p. 67 The group habitually performed seated around a table, which Steuart Wilson initially claimed was the standard practice for singing madrigals in Elizabethan times. It was only years later, after several other madrigal ensembles had adopted the practice in the belief it was authentic, that Wilson admitted that the group's practice simply was expediency to avoid his having to carry six music stands on public transport across London for rehearsals.Stewart, pp. 67‚Äì68 In January 1922 the group, by now named The English Singers, visited Prague, accompanied by Adrian Boult and Arthur Bliss, performing in the second half of a concert in the Smetana Hall, the first half being the Czech Philharmonic performing contemporary British music conducted by Boult and Bliss: according to Michael Kennedy, the singers enjoyed \\"the biggest success\\".Kennedy, Adrian Boult, p. 85 That April the English Singers toured Berlin, Prague and Vienna,Thomson, Oscar and Slonimsky, Nicolas (eds) (1942).

The group made its first recording with His Master's Voice in December 1921.Stewart, p. 68 For William Byrd's tercentenary in 1923 the group recorded five discs, singing one voice to a part.Haskell, p. 116. The early English music scholar, E.H. Fellowes, recalled that the English Singers' recording of Byrd's Short Service Magnificat, made on 29 January 1923, \\"was a revelation in its beauty when rightly performed; it exerted a widespread influence in church-music circles.\\" On the other hand, reviewing The English Singers' earliest discs, Harry Haskell notes the \\"lack of rhythmic definition\\" in the performances, though he allows that this may have been due, as Steuart Wilson recalled, to the acoustic process where they had to record with \\"six noses crowded into a single horn\\". There was, says Haskell, an improvement with the group's electric recordings, though their singing still suffered from \\"flaccid rhythms and unfocused tone\\". In October 1924, Whelen, Wilson and Carey were replaced by Nellie Carson, Norman Stone and Norman Notley. This group toured America in 1925, the first of many such tours. The New English Singers In October 1932 Kelly formed a new group, the New English Singers,Britten, p. 306. whose repertoire was again Elizabethan madrigals but also including contemporary works by Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. The members were Dorothy Silk and Nellie Carson (sopranos), Mary Morris (contralto), David Brynely and Norman Notley (tenors) and Kelly himself. The group toured in the United States, appearing at New York's Town Hall. Both tenors were replaced by 1936, the new tenors being Eric Greene and Peter Pears who joined the group in time for its tour that year in the United States and Canada.

Ro is the word for corpse and Langs is the perfect tense of \\"to rise up\\", so Ro-Langs literally means \\"a risen corpse\\". A ro-langs is usually created by a gdon spirit, or a sorcerer.Morema, Sage, 6-3-10, , 12-3-11 A ro-langs cannot speak or bend over, it signals its victims by wagging its tongue back and forth. They can not bend at any joints, which makes them walk with a stiff-armed lurch. In regions of Tibet there are low doorways to keep the ro-langs out.Wylie, JSTOR, 1964, , 12-3-11 Types Tantric The tantric types of ro-langs are raised from the dead through a ritual for personal reasons, such as to serve a necromancer and satisfy his lust for the power of the occult. A religious history written by Kun-dga'- snying-po contains one example. Na-ra-da gained mystical powers and set off to raise a ro-langs. He enlisted the help of a Buddhist Votary. When the tongue was cut off of the ro-langs, it turned into a sword of occult power, and the body turned into gold. The tantric type resembles the voodoo zombie. Demonic Demonic ro-langs are created by an evil spirit with the goal of contaminating other humans; they are independent, and do not serve a master. They are created by either a gdon spirit that has broken its oath and become evil, or a bgegs spirit, which is already evil. Once the consciousness has left the body, the evil spirit enters the body before it is buried. Demonic ro-langs have the power to infect other humans by touching them on the head. The idea of this type of ro-lang has helped shape the zombie in the film industry. Storytelling A ro-langs can be described in one of three storytelling formats. Legendary A legendary story consists of an incident that occurred many years ago, and has been told of for centuries. The characters described in the stories are often labeled without names, instead with title such as \\"mother\\", \\"father\\", \\"prince\\", etc. This makes them difficult to trace back to the original event. Epidemic In an epidemic story, a ro-langs rises and infects many people, often in one night. The ro- langs disease is transmitted by a ro-langs touching a person on the head. The story often ends with the ro-langs being defeated. Comatose A comatose story takes place at a definite location, a short time ago. The ro-langs in this story do not contaminate any people and they are quickly dispatched. Old Tibetan medical practices were not always sufficient for determining if a person is truly dead. Ro-langs in comatose stories have been described as having blue eyes instead of white. This is also a symptom of a person in a comatose state. It is believed that these people \\"rising from the dead\\" are actually just waking up from a comatose state. Vulnerability Ro-langs cannot be \\"killed\\" due to the fact that they have already died, but they can be made to \\"fall over\\" (brgyal-ba), a euphemism for killing the undead. The ro-langs can be classified by one of five vulnerabilities: 1\\\\. lpags-langs or skin-zombie; 2\\\\. khrag-langs or blood-zombie; 3\\\\. sha-langs or flesh-zombie; 4\\\\. rus-langs or bone-zombie; 5\\\\. rme-langs or mole-zombie. The prefix of the name describes the vulnerability. To make a skin-zombie fall over, one must break the skin. A blood-zombie must bleed, a flesh-zombie must be deeply cut or have flesh removed, a bone-zombie must have a fractured bone, and a mole-zombie is only vulnerable at a mole on the body. The types of ro-langs above are listed in order of difficulty to defeat. The skin-zombie is considered the easiest to defeat because the skin is easy to break, whereas the mole-zombie is considered to be the most difficult to defeat because of the small area of vulnerability, and the potential for the location of the mole to be unknown to the intended victim. Ro-langs are unable to bend at the waist; to exploit this weakness, many buildings in early Tibetan architecture were built with very low door frames. The belief was that the Ro-lang, unable to bend, would simply run into the low doorway, and be unable to enter the building.

They grow naturally in New Guinea and its surrounding region, in habitats from luxuriant lowland rainforests to steep highland forests. They naturally grow up to about tall in rainforests. Across various parts of New Guinea and the surrounding region's islands, collectively the three species have known distributions in Papua New Guinea and West Papua, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, the Aru Islands, Palau and Vanuatu. Considering the various sources of evidence of their growing in districts from rainforested city surrounds through to villages and to places far from cities' basic facilities or herbaria for botanical science, it is not surprising that official national herbaria hold numerous specimens of un- described, potentially new species, for example in Papua New Guinea's national herbarium in Lae. Botanists from European backgrounds have scientifically described the current three species as they obtained good enough herbarium dried specimen collections. In their written descriptions of the three species, they briefly comment about potential new species or segregate species, that they have seen on expeditions or refer to in other botanist's collections and descriptions. People from the region of New Guinea, working professionally, such as in government or science, have published written reports of some of the knowledge and uses of these species of trees. Also, the European botanists' writings allude briefly to the same facts, that societies living naturally in forest locations in this region know very well their own well established uses of these trees‚Äîregardless of unknown European scientific names; uses such as planted, long-term food tree‚Äìcrops around villages. The cooking and eating of the seeds of some varieties of these trees, after their planting and establishment as valued food tree‚Äìcrops, has been described in published written form in reports, articles and books. Published scientific morphology and anatomy observations place them within the subtribe Hakeinae (tribe Embothrieae) and correlate them most closely with some species of Grevillea, then after that with Hakea. Dutch botanist H. O. Sleumer included them within the genus Grevillea in 1939 and in his 1958 Flora Malesiana (Proteaceae) description as again Finschia. In 2009 the first step was reported in the still early studies of their genetics. Reported by botanists, these species of large trees often have remarkable large stilt roots growing out from up the trunk, sometimes from as high up as off the ground.

Supporting the \\"infrastructure as code\\" approach to data center system and network deployment and management, configuration automation, SecOps orchestration, vulnerability remediation, and hybrid cloud control.  History  Salt originated from the need for high-speed data collection and task execution for data center systems administrators managing massive infrastructure scale and resulting complexity. The author of Salt, Thomas S. Hatch, had previously created several utilities for IT teams to solve the problem of systems management at scale, but found these and other open source solutions to be lacking. Hatch decided to use the ZeroMQ messaging library to facilitate the high-speed requirements and built Salt using ZeroMQ for all networking layers. In late May 2011 initial progress was made toward the delivery of configuration management built on the Salt remote execution engine. This configuration management system stores all configuration (state) data inside an easily understood data structure that leverages YAML. While experimental functionality of the Salt State system was available in May 2011, it was not considered stable until the release of Salt 0.9.3 in November 2011. The Salt 0.14.0 release introduced an advanced cloud control system making private and public cloud VMs directly manageable with Salt. The Salt Cloud function allows for provisioning of any hybrid cloud host, then exposes Salt remote execution, configuration management, and event-driven automation capabilities to the newly provisioned hybrid cloud systems. New virtual machines and cloud instances are automatically connected to a Salt Master after creation. Salt Cloud supports 25 public and private cloud systems including AWS, Azure, VMware, IBM Cloud, and OpenStack. Salt Cloud provides an interface for Salt to interact with cloud hosts and the cloud‚Äôs functionality such as DNS, storage, load balancers, etc. In September 2020, VMware acquired SaltStack.  Design  Salt was designed to be highly modular and easily extensible, to make it easy to mold to diverse enterprise IT use cases. The module design of Salt creates Python modules that handle certain aspects of the available Salt systems. These modules allow for the interactions within Salt to be detached and modified to suit the needs of a developer or system administrator. The Salt system maintains many module types to manage specific actions. Modules can be added to any of the systems that support dynamic modules. These modules manage all the remote execution and state management behavior of Salt. The modules can be separated into six groups: * Execution modules are the workhorse for Salt's functionality. They represent the functions available for direct execution from the remote execution engine. These modules contain the specific cross platform information used by Salt to manage portability, and constitute the core API of system level functions used by Salt systems. * State modules are the components that make up the backend for the Salt configuration management system. These modules execute the code needed to enforce, set up or change the configuration of a target system. Like other modules, more states become available when they are added to the states modules. * Grains are a system for detecting static information about a system and storing it in RAM for rapid gathering. * Renderer modules are used to render the information passed to the Salt state system. The renderer system is what makes it possible to represent Salt's configuration management data in any serializable format. * Returners: the remote execution calls made by Salt are detached from the calling system; this allows the return information generated by the remote execution to be returned to an arbitrary location. Management of arbitrary return locations is managed by the Returner Modules. * Runners are master side convenience applications executed by the salt-run command.  Vulnerabilities  In April 2020, F-Secure revealed two high severity RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2020-11651 and CVE-2020-11652, with CVSS score reaching as high as 10. These critical vulnerabilities were found within Salt's default communication channel ZeroMQ, and the initial research discovered 6000 vulnerable Salt servers. Salt organization was notified before F-Secure's public announcement, and Salt soon released the patch in its updated releases: 2019.2.4 and 3000.2.

Items commonly found in pilots' flight bags include: operating manuals for the aircraft being flown, operations manuals for the flight crew, aeronautical and navigational charts (usually Jeppesen chart binders or \\"Jepps\\", a Route Manual, flight checklists, logbooks and weather information), pilot's documentation and licenses (such as their passport, pilot's license, Aviation English license, class-specific medical certificate), and equipment or accessories (such as a calculator, pens, sunglasses, radio headphones or binoculars). Recent advances in technology and miniaturization have seen the development and deployment of electronic flight bags (EFBs), which contain electronic manuals and documents, as well as automated calculation and navigation tools. According to United Airlines, a conventional paper-based flight bag contains an average of 12,000 sheets of paper per pilot. The airline estimated that deployment of an EFB system running on Apple iPads would save the airline nearly 16 million sheets of paper a year, as well as saving 326,000 gallons of jet fuel due to the reduced weight on board the aircraft.

The schanze is additionally protected in this example by a couvreface A schanze () is, according to the specialist terminology of German fortification construction, an independent fieldwork, that is frequently used in the construction of temporary (not permanent) field fortifications.R√ºstow: Milit√§risches Handw√∂rterbuch. 1859, s.v. Schanze The word is German and has no direct English equivalent, although the word sconce is derived from Dutch schans, which is cognate to the German word. In everyday German speech, however, it is commonplace to refer to permanent fortifications as schanzen, because in many places in times of war, fieldworks that were only temporarily thrown up were later turned into permanent fortifications.  Derivation  The word Schanze derives originally from the fact that, during sieges in the Late Middle Ages, temporary defensive positions had frequently been built out of gabions, known in German as Schanzk√∂rbe.Duden: Herkunftsw√∂rterbuch. under Schanze Later such schanzen very often consisted of earthen ramparts. As a result, in the 16th century, the verb schanzen became generally associated with earthworks of all kinds. In modern German military use, schanzen is still used to mean the construction of smaller earthworks, especially of fire trenches. From this already derived usage comes the phrase sich verschanzen, \\"to entrench oneself\\" in yet another derivative sense.  As defensive systems  Baroque schanze as a redoubt with chartaque in Gersbach. Baroque schanze in the form of a star at the B√∂llner Eck near Neuenweg. As a rule a schanze is an independent fortified work. To block a valley or a pass, however, a line of adjacent schanzen could be erected, not infrequently connected by a low rampart and ditch. In this case it is referred to as a verschanzte Linie ‚Äì a fortified line of schanzen. If such a defensive line completely enclosed an area on all sides, it was described as a verschanztes Lager ‚Äì a fortified (with schanzen) position. It was not uncommon in the 17th and 18th centuries for weaker armies to construct such works in order to protect themselves from a stronger foe. During sieges fortified lines of schanzen were often used as lines of contravallation or circumvallation. Depending on the layout, a distinction is made between \\"open\\" (offene) and \\"closed\\" (geschlossene) schanzen. The closed type are further divided into redoubts, that only have outward-facing angles, and \\"star schanzen\\" (Sternschanzen) with alternating inward and outward facing corners. In open schanzen, which may take the shape of a fl√®che, redan, half-redoubt, lunette, hornwork or even more complex designs, the gorge is open, i.e. the side where the army was encamped or on which their own defences lay, was unfortified. There is a very extensive system of schanzen in the Black Forest, elements of which have survived. See Baroque fortifications in the Black Forest.

Before becoming a full-time fiction writer, Gan worked as a reporter, as a middle school teacher, and as a playwright of a small theater. Widely recognized as one of the best authors of his generation, Gan has received various literary awards, including the United Daily News Literature Prize, the Lin Rong-San Literature Prize, (in Chinese) Wu Zhuo-liu Literature Prize, (in Chinese) and the United Daily New Novelist Prize. In 2010, his novel Killing Ghosts won the Award of Taipei International Book Fair, and in 2015, his The Pangcah Girl won the First Prize of Taiwan Literary Award. Several of his novels have been adapted into television series. He has also served as writer-in-residence at Providence University.  Writing career  Owing to his Hakka origin, Gan's writings are often colored with Hakka language, culture and history. In addition, Gan often uses dense imagery while appropriating elements from fairy tale, fable, and folklore. As a result, the feelings of humans and animals become interchangeable but at the same time remain distinct; the complex interactions among Taiwan's various ethnic and social groups are revealed as well. Gan is best known for the following two books: The School of Water-ghosts and the Otter Who Lost His Mother melds various fairy-tale elements together; it received the China Times Annual Top 10 Book Award, with critics calling it that year's \\"most creative novel\\". Killing the Ghost, a historical novel, deals with issues of Taiwanese identities resulting from fifty years of the Japanese occupation and from the iron-fist rule of the KMT after World War II. Gan Yao-ming, against the backdrops of the Kominka Movement (the Japanization of Taiwanese Movement in 1937 during the second Sino-Japan War)and the 228 Incident (the cause of the KMT's enforcement of martial law on Taiwan from 1947 to 1987), depicts the insanity of that era as well as the unfailing vitality of people living on the island of Taiwan, be they post-World War II Mainland Chinese emigres, or the natives formerly colonized by the Japanese.

Operation Until 2007, European monitors from the European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah (EUBAM Rafah) used the Kerem Shalom crossing to get to the Rafah Border Crossing. The EUBAM heads a Liaison Office at Kerem Shalom which receives real-time video and data feeds of the activities at the Rafah crossing. The Liaison Office meets regularly to review implementation of the Agreed Principles for Rafah Crossing, to resolve any dispute pertaining to the agreement, and to perform other tasks specified therein. The Liaison Office is manned by liaison officers from EUBAM, the Palestinian Authority, and the Government of Israel. Since 2010, NIS 75 million have been invested in upgrading and expanding the crossing, which is capable of handling 450 trucks a day. The Palestinian side of the crossing is operated by two families who were granted a franchise by the Palestinian Authority and authorized by Hamas. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Ramallah coordinates activity with Israel. The two sides are 400 meters apart, separated by a drop-off zone for unloading goods. In December 2012, Israel eased its restrictions on the import of building materials, allowing the transfer of 20 truckloads of aggregates and 34 truckloads of gravel from Egypt.

The reason for the claim is that Bobai makes a four-way tonal distinction in checked syllables, whereas most other Yue dialects have three. In Yulin dialect just to the north of Bobai, however, neither entering tone is split: there are just two entering tones, 7 and 8. Lee (1993) believes that Bobai is innovative in having split 8, whereas Yulin (along with several neighboring interior Yue dialects) is innovative in having merged a former split in 7: proto-Yue probably had 7a, 7b, and 8. Many Yue varieties exhibit a \\"changed tone\\" with some semantic content. Such tones occur in the Yulin dialect, in checked syllables only, marking diminutives. In such cases, the final stop -p, -t or -k is changed to a homorganic nasal -m, -n or -≈ã, respectively, and the pitch contour is also altered. This seems to be a trace of a now-lost suffix similar to √©r (ÂÖí, Middle Chinese nye) in other Chinese varieties. References *Gina Lee, 1993.

Before reaching a height of it suddenly pitched nose-up, stalled and crashed onto its belly beyond the end of the airstrip. Fuel from the aircraft's tanks caught fire and the aircraft burned fiercely. All 21 people on board died, either of injuries during the crash or in the ensuing conflagration. It was the worst civil aviation accident in Queensland at the time,\\"State's Worst Air Crash\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 11 March 1949, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 and the second-worst accident in Australia. It occurred exactly three years after the worst, the ANA DC-3 crash near Hobart on 10 March 1946.\\"Toll Of 21 Lives In Air Disaster\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 11 March 1949, p.3 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 Investigation of the crash uncovered some errors in the information used to determine the position of the aircraft's centre of gravity. It became clear that the aircraft had taken off with its centre of gravity slightly outside the approved limits. Investigators also found evidence that the takeoff may have been performed with the elevator trim tab still set for landing. If the elevator trim tab had not been set for takeoff this would have been exacerbated by the incorrect position of the centre of gravity and the aircraft would have been uncontrollable.  The flight  Queensland Airlines used Lockheed Lodestar VH-BAG to conduct a regular passenger service between Brisbane, Casino, Coffs Harbour, Coolangatta and Brisbane.\\"21 Killed When Plane Burst Into Fire\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 11 March 1949, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 VH-BAG arrived at Bilinga airstrip, on the outskirts of Coolangatta, from Coffs Harbour with 11 of its 16 passenger seats occupied. Some passengers left the aircraft at Bilinga and others boarded for the flight of to Archerfield Airport in Brisbane. The aircraft was parked at the Queensland Airlines terminal for about a quarter of an hour before departing at 11:15 am local time. On board were 16 adult passengers and 2 infants, 2 pilots and an air hostess. All passenger seats were occupied. Observers saw the aircraft taxi to the end of the strip, turn around and promptly commence its take-off run. The crash The take-off appeared to be normal until the undercarriage retracted. The aircraft quickly pitched nose-up into an almost vertical attitude. First the aircraft rolled to the right until the wing was almost vertical, then it rolled to the left. The aircraft reached a height estimated to be between and then began descending and curving to the left. It continued to descend until it crashed onto its belly, tree stumps tearing open the underside of the left wing and the fuselage beneath the cabin door. The aircraft slid for only about before stopping about beyond the end of the strip. It came to rest in the shallow waters of a swamp at the edge of the airstrip.Aviation Safety Network Retrieved 30 November 2011 Within seconds of the crash, flame and black smoke erupted from the wreckage. Only a small number of people were at the airstrip and saw the crash. The airport groundsman and an airline staff member grabbed portable fire extinguishers, jumped into a car and raced across the airstrip. Others at the airstrip and nearby beaches ran towards the burning aircraft. The aircraft's cabin door had been torn away by a tree stump and lay about behind the aircraft but despite the open doorway no-one inside the passenger cabin attempted to escape. Fuel floating on the surface of the water was burning fiercely, making it dangerous to approach the wreckage. One of the first witnesses to reach the scene believed he saw two people at the front of the passenger cabin who were alive but before he could get close enough to investigate he was driven back by flames. A fire engine from Coolangatta arrived within minutes of the crash. The boggy swamp made it difficult to manoeuvre the vehicle close to the wreckage. Firemen initially attacked the fire with portable fire extinguishers and then used the fire engine to pump water from the swamp onto the blazing wreckage. Two firemen found a way around the burning fuel on the surface of the water and climbed onto the wing with their hose. The fire burned fiercely for 30 minutes but was not completely extinguished for another hour. Apart from the outer wings and the tail section, little of the aircraft was recognisable. Both halves of the tailplane were visibly bent downwards. The wreckage of the wings and engine mounts also showed they had suffered severe downward bending indicating the severity of the impact. The charred body of one of the pilots was half-way out a cockpit window, suggesting he survived the crash and attempted to escape from the wreckage. At 3:15 pm police, ambulance and volunteers began to remove the bodies of victims from the wreckage. By 4:30 pm 20 bodies had been recovered. All were burned beyond recognition. Searching for the body of the final victim, a rope was attached to the row of burned seats and a truck was used to move the seat row. Underneath the seats was the body of a man, almost submerged under the water, his face protected by the swamp water and still recognisable.  Investigation  The Director-General of Civil Aviation immediately appointed an investigation panel comprising specialists from the Department of Civil Aviation. Evidence from eyewitnesses led the panel to conclude that the aircraft climbed to a height of less than and then stalled.\\"Want full official report on crash\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 21 June 1949, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 An initial investigation of the aircraft showed no evidence of any failure in the control system. The throttles were fully open, the magneto switches on, and the propellers in fine pitch. The undercarriage was retracted, but the flaps were extended 15¬∞. The disposition of the cables on the trim tab mechanism showed a setting typical of a landing. In its report the panel stated the accident was caused by the aircraft being loaded so its centre of gravity was behind the rear limit. The report also stated that incorrect setting of the elevator trim tab may have been a contributory cause.\\"Big job faces Coroner before finding\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 29 June 1949, p.7 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 The rear limit for the centre of gravity was 39% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. The load sheet prepared for the fatal flight indicated the centre of gravity of VH-BAG was at 39.2% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. The load sheet was based on a load chart prepared by the Department of Civil Aviation and based on information supplied by the RAAF. During the investigation, inquiries were made with the US Civil Aeronautics Administration and this revealed an error in the load chart. The main undercarriage of the Lockheed Lodestar retracted to the rear so that retraction caused the centre of gravity to move rearwards but this was not taken into account in the design of the load chart. Other errors also came to light. The passenger seats were further apart than shown on the load chart, causing the centre of gravity to be further to the rear than calculated, especially when the aircraft was fully loaded. Up to of food and beverages for the passengers were stored at the rear of the passenger cabin but were not taken into account on the load chart. Investigation of the accident concluded that after the aircraft's undercarriage retracted, the centre of gravity would have been at about 43.4% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. With the centre of gravity 4% of MAC behind the rear limit the aircraft would have been tail-heavy and longitudinally unstable.\\"Bilinga crash finding\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 23 March 1949, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 The aircraft had been in daily civil operations in Australia since November 1946 so the investigators assumed there must have been numerous flights with the centre of gravity significantly more than 39% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. It was necessary for the investigators to find something unique about the fatal flight of VH-BAG that would explain its sudden climb immediately after take- off and the pilot's inability to regain control and prevent the aircraft crashing. The aircraft's tailplane was one of the few parts of the aircraft not destroyed by fire. The position of the elevator trim tab spool appeared to be in the normal position for landing rather than a typical position for take- off. The investigators concluded that on the final takeoff it was likely that the elevator trim tab was still set for landing. This, coupled with the aircraft being tail-heavy and longitudinally unstable after undercarriage retraction, caused the aircraft to pitch nose-up so strongly that the pilot was unable to retain control or prevent the aircraft stalling.Job, Macarthur. \\"Horror at Coolangatta.\\" Flight Safety Australia, via casa.gov.au, November‚ÄìDecember 1999, p. 47. Retrieved: 30 November 2011 Minister for Civil Aviation Arthur Drakeford made a public announcement that the accident had occurred because the aircraft was tail-heavy and unstable as the result of incorrect loading. The Minister said the operator had not taken adequate steps to ensure safe loading of its aircraft and he hinted that stricter regulation of the loading of aircraft was being considered.\\"Plane loading control\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 10 May 1949, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 The Minister announced that a public inquiry into the accident was unnecessary because the exact cause had been determined by his Department's investigation. He also refused to make public the investigation panel's report.

In addition to varying degrees of incineration, fractures of the skull, legs, arms and wrists were found. Even if the aircraft had not caught fire, a number of the occupants would have died from injuries they received in the crash. An inquest into the deaths of the 21 occupants was conducted by the Southport District Coroner Mr P.W. Shepherd. The inquest was conducted over a period of 16 days, making it Queensland's longest-running coronial inquest. The inquest heard from 22 witnesses. Counsel representing the aircraft operator, Queensland Airlines, asked that the report of the investigation panel be made available to him. He complained that the report was critical of Queensland Airlines and yet he did not have the opportunity to read it, test its validity or cross- examine members of the investigation panel. He also complained about the implication that Queensland Airlines was guilty of causing the crash and said legal counsel for some of the parties were using the Coroner's inquest to prepare for legal action against Queensland Airlines.\\"Claim at Bilinga inquest\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 16 June 1949, p.7 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 He interrupted evidence being presented by a member of the Department's investigation panel to ask that the panel's report be made available. Counsel representing the Department of Civil Aviation passed this request to the Director-General of Civil Aviation but the Director-General's response was that the report was not to be made available to legal representatives or the public.\\"Denies repair to plane neglected\\" The Courier- Mail ‚Äì 24 June 1949, p.3 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 The Queensland Attorney-General, Mr Devries, announced that Coroners' reports were confidential and for the benefit of the Attorney-General. He said the report by Mr Shepherd into the deaths of 21 people at Bilinga airstrip on 10 March would not be made public.\\"Secrecy over Bilinga dead\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 28 July 1949, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 This decision attracted criticism.\\"Why the mystery?\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 29 July 1949, p.2 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011  Aircraft loading  Queensland Airlines and its agents did not have weighing scales for use with passengers and luggage. The Traffic Manager for Queensland Airlines advised that sets of weighing scales had been purchased but were not in use because they had not been approved by the Department of Weights and Measures.\\"Wasn‚Äôt Drunk At Aerodrome\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 9 June 1949, p.3 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 He said that at every port other than Bilinga passengers could use some other company's weighing scales, and passengers intending to board at Bilinga could use the weighing scales at the nearby railway station.\\"Cancelled air trip before take- off\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 8 June 1949, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 Staff of Queensland Airlines at Bilinga asked passengers to estimate their weight. The company allotted particular seats to its passengers but passengers did not always occupy the seats allotted to them. The weight of the aircraft at the time of take-off was within the maximum limit specified in its certificate of airworthiness.\\"Within Weight Limit\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 11 March 1949, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 After the undercarriage retracted, the aircraft's centre of gravity was behind the rear limit by between 4.3% and 4.9% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. The Chief Pilot of Queensland Airlines told the inquest he did not believe the accident was caused by incorrect loading of the aircraft. He said the load sheet showed the aircraft's centre of gravity was at 39.2% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord and therefore only slightly outside the approved limit. He said if the aircraft's centre of gravity was significantly behind its rear limit the pilot would become aware of it before the aircraft left the ground. It was his opinion that some other mechanical problem must have occurred to cause the accident.  Air hostess  The body of the air hostess was found in the cockpit rather than near the hostess's seat at the rear of the passenger cabin. The Chief Pilot of Queensland Airlines suggested the pilot would have examined the waybill and would have been aware the aircraft was tail-heavy. It was likely he asked the air hostess to sit in the cockpit during the take-off to eliminate the tail-heaviness. The Chief Pilot told the inquest the loading chart indicated that if the air hostess had been sitting in the cockpit the aircraft's centre of gravity would have been within the approved limits.  Pilot competency  The pilot and co-pilot on the fatal flight both had substantial experience with the armed services before joining Queensland Airlines. Since joining the company the pilot had accumulated about another 2300 hours, and the co-pilot about another 1700 hours. The Chief Pilot of Queensland Airlines told the inquest that both were excellent aviators.  The Keegan family  Four of the passengers on the fatal flight were from one family. Captain Harold Keegan, his wife and their two infant sons aged 2¬Ω years and 1 year boarded the aircraft at Bilinga to return to Archerfield. They had been holidaying at nearby Coolangatta. Captain Keegan was the Chief Pilot for Queensland Airlines.\\"21 incinerated in Q‚Äôld plane disaster\\" The Argus ‚Äì 11 March 1949, p.3 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 The Traffic Manager for Queensland Airlines, Mr Desmond Leigh, had flown from Brisbane to Bilinga airstrip earlier in the day and wanted to fly back to Brisbane. All seats were reserved so he decided to off-load Captain Keegan. There were allegations that Mr Leigh may have argued with the pilot about being allowed to board the flight in place of Captain Keegan. There was also an allegation that Mr Leigh boarded the Lodestar and only left when chased off by the pilot. This may have been significant to the investigation of the crash if an argument so distracted the pilots that they omitted to properly set the elevator trim prior to take-off. Mr Leigh told the inquest that when he learned Captain Keegan was travelling with his wife and two children he changed his decision and allowed Captain Keegan to accompany his family. He said he decided to return to Brisbane by train. Another witness also denied there had been an argument between Mr Leigh and the pilot.\\"Witnesses Claim Manager Sober\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 10 June 1949, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 Captain Keegan and his wife boarded the plane and each placed one of their sons on their lap. The inquest was concerned that as the Keegan family boarded the flight at Bilinga airstrip their weights, and particularly the weight of Captain Keegan, may not have been properly taken into account in determining the position of the centre of gravity.  Allegations of secrecy  The apparent secrecy surrounding the report written by the investigation panel from the Department of Civil Aviation attracted strong criticism. After the Minister, Mr Drakeford, announced to the House of Representatives that there was no need for a public inquiry into the disaster because he and his Department already knew the cause, he was attacked for presuming to know all the reasons when the Coroner's inquest was still in progress.'Let‚Äôs have all the facts\\" The Courier-Mail ‚Äì 22 June 1949, p.2 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 An editorial in the Brisbane Courier-Mail claimed the Minister was trying to avoid public inquiries into aviation accidents. The Attorney- General's decision to withhold the Coroner's report also attracted strong criticism. In the report of the Air Court of Inquiry into the 1948 crash of the DC-3 Lutana, Mr Justice William Simpson was strongly critical of the Department of Civil Aviation's air navigation policy.\\"Court Says Directional Aids Misled Lutana‚Äôs Pilot\\" The Argus ‚Äì 25 November 1948, p.7 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 The Minister, Mr Drakeford, vigorously defended his Department against Justice Simpson's criticism.\\"Lutana Disaster Inquiry Report Tabled\\" The Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì 25 November 1948, p.4 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 Justice Simpson was attacked in the Senate.\\"Judge Simpson Attacked in Senate on Lutana Finding\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 2 December 1948, p.4 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 30 November 2011 An editorial in the Courier-Mail attacked the secrecy surrounding the Queensland Airlines accident and claimed that by not publishing his Department's report the Minister, Mr Drakeford, showed he had learned nothing from Justice Simpson's inquiry into the crash of the Lutana.  Aircraft  The aircraft was manufactured in 1942 as a model C-60 for the RAF and assigned constructor's serial number 2194. The RAF order was cancelled so it was delivered to the USAAF and assigned military serial number 42-32174. In September 1942 it arrived in Brisbane and saw military service with the USAAF and RAAF. In June 1945 it was withdrawn from service at Parafield Airport, South Australia. In February 1946 it was sold to a Brisbane company, Aircrafts Pty Ltd, and converted to civil configuration by installation of 8 passenger seats either side of a central aisle, and a seat at the rear for an air hostess.Adastron Retrieved 30 November 2011 In November 1946 it was registered VH-BAG. In October 1948 Aircrafts Pty Ltd began trading under the name Queensland Airlines and used VH-BAG on regular airline services. It was the only Lockheed Lodestar in regular airline services in Australia.

Narrated by Ganesha, Hindu god of \\"wisdom, prudence, acceptance and love,\\" it is the story of two friends, Margaret Civil and Katharine Brynne, who explore their differences, life-tragedies, and opinions during a healing trip to India. Ganesha accompanies the women through a series of exhilarating moments and profound experiences in a climate and culture that is completely foreign to the two travelers. Plot Two middle-aged friends from Connecticut, Katherine Brynne and Margaret Civil, travel to India, avoiding their usual, safe vacation spots. Each is, in her own way, seeking to heal from the death of a son. While exploring its cities (with the goal of reaching the Taj Mahal), they encounter the Hindu god, Ganesha. However, Ganesha is not just a single entity, but exists in many people they meet. Katherine is convinced that she needs to kiss a leper, possibly to atone for not supporting her murdered son, Walter. Margaret is hiding the fact that she feels she let her son, Gabriel, be killed, as well as possible breast cancer. They eventually reach the Taj Mahal, whose splendor transforms them. They return to Connecticut to discover Katherine's husband has died, but connected in a deeper, honest friendship.

It is awarded annually to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year. History The prize was established to recognise the literary achievement of female writers. The inspiration for the Baileys Prize was the Booker Prize of 1991, when none of the six shortlisted books was by a woman, despite some 60% of novels published that year being by female authors. A group of women and men working in the industry ‚Äì authors, publishers, agents, booksellers, librarians, journalists ‚Äì therefore met to discuss the issue. Research showed that women‚Äôs literary achievements were often not acknowledged by the major literary prizes. The winner of the prize receives ¬£30,000, along with a bronze sculpture called the Bessie created by artist Grizel Niven, the sister of actor and writer David Niven. Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June; within days the winner is announced. The winner is selected by a board of \\"five leading women\\" each year. The prize has \\"spawned\\" several sub-category competitions and awards: the Harper's Bazaar Broadband Short Story Competition, the Orange Award for New Writers, the Penguin/Orange Readers' Group Prize, and the Reading Book Group of the Year.O'Donnell, Patrick (ed.), The Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Fiction, see \\"Awards and Prizes\\" by Richard Todd, pp. 19‚Äì22.Maunder, Andrew (ed.), The Facts On File Companion to the British Short Story, see \\"Awards and Prizes\\" by Vana Avegerinou, pp. 22‚Äì24. In support of the 2004 award, the Orange Prize for Fiction published a list of 50 contemporary \\"essential reads\\". The books were chosen by a sample of 500 people attending the Guardian Hay Festival and represent the audience's \\"must have\\" books by living UK writers. The list is called the Orange Prize for Fiction's \\"50 Essential Reads by Contemporary Authors\\".\\"Harry's 'must-read' snub\\", London Evening Standard, 7 June 2004. The prize was originally sponsored by Orange, a telecommunications company. In May 2012, it was announced Orange would be ending its corporate sponsorship of the prize. There was no corporate sponsor for 2013; sponsorship was by \\"private benefactors\\", led by Cherie Blair and writers Joanna Trollope and Elizabeth Buchan. Beginning in 2014, the prize was sponsored by the liquor brand Baileys Irish Cream, owned by the drinks conglomerate Diageo. In January 2017, Diageo announced that it had \\"regretfully decided to make way for a new sponsor\\"; the 2017 prize to be announced in June, will be the last it supports. In June 2017, the prize announced it would change its name to simply \\"Women's Prize for Fiction\\" starting in 2018, and will be supported by a family of sponsors. Winners and shortlisted writers The winner of the most recent, 2020 Women's Prize for Fiction was Maggie O'Farrell for her book Hamnet. #ThisBook In May 2014, Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction launched the #ThisBook campaign to find out which books, written by women, have had the biggest impact on readers. Nineteen \\"inspirational women\\" were chosen to launch the campaign and then thousands of people from the \\"general public\\" submitted their ideas via Twitter. The 20 winners were announced 29 July 2014. The organisers noted that over half the winning books were published before 1960. #To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee #The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood #Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bront√´ #Harry Potter, J.

The books show the author's real name on the book jacket, in a series titled Reclaim Her Name. Criticism The fact that the prize excludes male writers has provoked comment. After the prize was founded, Auberon Waugh nicknamed it the \\"Lemon Prize,\\" while Germaine Greer said there would soon be a prize for \\"writers with red hair\\". A. S. Byatt, who won the 1990 Man Booker Prize, said it was a \\"sexist prize\\", claiming \\"such a prize was never needed\\". She refused to have her work considered for this prize. In 2007, former editor of The Times Simon Jenkins called the prize \\"sexist\\". In 2008, writer Tim Lott said, \\"the Orange Prize is sexist and discriminatory, and it should be shunned\\". On the other hand, in 2011 London journalist Jean Hannah Edelstein wrote about her own \\"wrong reasons\\" for supporting the prize: > Unfortunately, the evidence shows that the experiences of male and female > writers after they set their pens down are often distinctively different. > That's why I've changed my mind about the Orange prize. I still agree with > Byatt that the idea of female-specific subject matter is spurious, but I > don't think that's what the prize rewards. In 2012 Cynthia Ozick, writing in The New York Times, said the Prize \\"was not born into an innocent republic of letters\\" when it comes to a history of women writers being discriminated against. She concluded, \\"For readers and writers, in sum, the more prizes the better, however they are structured, and philosophy be damned.\\" In 1999 Lola Young, chair of the judges' panel, claimed that British female literature fell into two categories, either \\"insular and parochial\\" or \\"domestic in a piddling kind of way\\". Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000. In 2001 a panel of male critics strongly criticised the Orange shortlist and produced its own. In 2007, broadcaster Muriel Gray, chair of the panel, said that judges had to wade through \\"a lot of dross\\" to get to the shortlist, but praised that year's winner, Half of a Yellow Sun by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, saying, \\"This is a moving and important book by an incredibly exciting author.\\" See also * List of literary awards honoring women References External links * *Shortlisted works for the Orange Prize at LibraryThing *Orange Prize for Fiction's \\"50 Essential Reads by Contemporary Authors\\" at LibraryThing Category:Awards established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Literary awards honoring women ","title":"Women's Prize for Fiction"},{"id":"33961266","text":"Alexander Nikolaevich Volkov (Russian: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤; August 31, 1886, in Fergana - December 17, 1957, in Tashkent) was an avant-garde Russian painter and poet. Early life Alexander Volkov was born in Fergana, near Tashkent in the Russian Empire. His father, Nikolai Ivanovich Volkov, was a lieutenant-general in the medical corps, and his mother, Feodosia Filippovna Volkova-Davydova, by some accounts, was a gypsy camp follower. Between 1888 and 1900 he studied in primary schools in Tashkent. Between 1900-1905 Volkov was enrolled with the Second Orenburg Cadets Corps. In 1906, he started his college study in the Physics and Mathematics Faculty at the St Petersburg University, but abandoned it two years later to join the studio of Vladimir Makovsky, who at the time was an instructor at the Superior School of Art at the Imperial Academy of Arts. A big influence on his artistic development was his attendance at the private studio of M.D. Bernstein, where some of his teachers were Nicholas Roerich, Ivan Bilibin and Leonid Sherwood. In 1912, Volkov moved to Kiev to train at the Kiev School of Arts. In 1915, the painter married Maria Ilyinichna Taratutina (1898‚Äì1925). In 1916, after finishing his training, Volkov returned to Uzbekistan where he lived till the end of his life. Artistic career Persian Woman (1916) From 1916 his style was post- Impressionistic and then neo-primitivist which derived partly from Russian sign painting. Initially Volkov was under the strong influence of Vrubel and Roerich. Then he started painting in the same way as early Kandinsky. After moving to Uzbekistan, Volkov's works became marked by the influence of Matisse, Derain, Gauguin and Van Gogh. Then he went on to experimenting in the field of near-abstract art and became close in his manner to Tatlin and Malevich. In 1919 Volkov was named the first director of the State Museum of Arts of Central Asia, which had been given the former palace of the Grand Duke Constantine Romanov in Tashkent to house its collection. From 1929 to 1946, Volkov taught at the Tashkent School of Arts. Between 1927 and 1930, Volkov was a member of a local union Masters of the New East. In 1931-1932 Volkov organized the so-called Volkov's Brigade of painters, art critics and journalists, with the purpose of creating objects and propaganda of art. In 1934 Volkov went to Moscow to participate in his first big exhibition held at the State Museum of Arts of the Peoples of the Orient. After this exhibition, several of Volkov's canvases were acquired by the State Tretyakov Gallery and the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg. That same year, Volkov's picture Morning in Shakhimardan was for the first time exhibited in the West, at the Soviet Art exhibition in Philadelphia. Between 1934 - 1936 the political campaign of fighting formalism in art began in USSR. Volkov's art was declared formalist and anti-socialist. His canvases were labeled as counterrevolutionary. In 1946 Volkov was awarded the title of the People's Artist of Uzbekistan. When the campaign against free-thinking artists, writers and painters began in the USSR following orders from Stalin, Volkov along with writer Mikhail Zoshenko, poet Anna Akhmatova, painters Alexander Osmerkin and Robert Falk was labeled as an anti-communist formalist and abstractionist. He was fired from all his posts, lost all his earnings and money, and was committed to living in full isolation. In the following three years, all of Volkov's pictures were removed from the leading Russian museums. Indeed, until his death in 1957, the leaders of the Uzbekistan Union of Painters, after orders from Moscow, fully isolated Volkov from any contact with any painters, art critics and lovers of art who chanced to come to Tashkent. To anyone who wanted to meet Volkov, they declared that the painter was too severely ill to see them. Style Volkov's style was a mixture of Modernism and traditional Russian art. Much of his work has been informed by Cubo-Futurism. Volkov, as an ethnic Russian who lived most of his life in Turkestan, often felt himself an outsider, yet was a keen observer of the daily life. This lends him a feeling of celebration and joy. Despite Vrubel's influence on his style and composition, he did not succumb to the former's preoccupation with tragedy. Instead, referring to his generation as \\"nomads\\", he found joy in the Uzbek land, and the desert was a metaphor for the familiar and melodic, so distant from Vrubel's agonies. In his undergraduate years as a biology student at St Petersburg University, he was fascinated by the microscope and its revelation of the harmony, beauty and majesty of living matter, resulting in the crystalline structure of his compositions. Volkov, too, learned from the Symbolist aesthetic, and was interested in frescoes and murals. He considered his work as a contribution to the natural architecture of Uzbekistan, although he only received one major fresco commission, that of the Turkestan Pavilion at the All Russian Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow (1923). Religious - both Christian and pagan - themes colour Volkov's work. For example, his Lamentation (1921) is nominally about the bereavement of Christ's mother, yet depicts three bare-breasted women that hearken to the local legend of a god whose death is lamented by these women. At the same time, this was a severely dissident action on the part of the artist during a period when the Bolsheviks were busy destroying houses of worship, which speaks to his adherence to the principle of freedom of individual belief. Volkov was keen to depict the quotidian rhythms and viewscapes of Turkestani life. He painted tea-houses (chaikhanas), caravans, roads, mountains. He would spend hours walking across the country, making studies and then painting them intensively, irritable at any interruptions. Volkov is moved by fire - by the purple and the gold. His skies are golden and the ground is multicoloured, and an unquenchable flame lurks beneath. In 1923, the art historian Alexei Sidorov said of Volkov's work: ...by their rich colours and rhythm provide a description of the East which cannot be found elsewhere. His art is European and leftist in form. In many works, there is more Paris than Tashkent, more Matisse and Picasso than an Eastern carpet.\\" Volkov himself said of his work: > The painting of the East is built chiefly on the primitive and on a > painterly, decorative beginning. This is the basis of my work. Elaborating > works of primitive flatness, I have introduced a whole system of triangles > and other geometric forms and arrived at the depiction of man based on the > triangle, that being the simplest of forms. In view of the politicisation of Soviet art and the demands of creating a nationalist art form that was distinct from modernism, Volkov used this argument to support his use of geometry (informed by Cubo-Futurism) as an overlay on an Uzbek sensibility. Poetry Volkov wrote verses in the 1920s that served to illustrate his creativity. Sergei Yesenin visited him in Tashkent in those years, and impressed by his poetry, encouraged him to join the Imaginists. Personal life In 1925, Volkov's first wife Maria Taratutina died. He married Elena Semenovna Volkova-Melnikova (1901‚Äì1959) the following year. In 1928 his first son Valery Volkov was born, who became a famous painter and art critic. In 1937 Volkov's younger son Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov was born, who later became a painter and sculptor. Volkov died in 1957, and was buried in Tashkent. The concrete bust on his grave was created by his son Alexander. Posthumous Acclaim In 1960, several of Volkov's canvases were acquired by the famous collector George Costakis. They now appear at the Costakis collection of the State Museum of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki. In 1967, Volkov's first posthumous exhibition was held at the State Museum of Oriental Art - 33 years after his very first exhibition there - organised by his son Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov. In 2007, a grand exhibition Alexander Volkov. The Sun and the Caravan celebrating the 120th anniversary of the artist's birth was held at the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. The highest price paid for a Volkov painting at auction is ¬£909,000 for the Listening to the Bedana (oil on canvas, laid on board, 97.5 by 97.5 cm), sold at MacDougall's in December 2011. In 2012, the first solo-exhibition of Volkov's work outside the erstwhile Soviet Union was held at Christie's.

The Apache Campaign of 1896 was the final United States Army operation against Apaches who were raiding and not living in a reservation. It began in April after some Apaches killed three American settlers in Arizona. The Apaches were pursued by the army, which caught up with them in the Four Corners region of Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora and Chihuahua. There were only two important encounters during the campaign and, because both of them occurred in the remote Four Corners region, it is unknown if they took place on American or Mexican soil. Background Though the Apache Wars ended at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona in September 1886, when Geronimo surrendered, small bands of Chiricahuas continued to fight against the United States and Mexico from their strongholds in the Sierra Madre. There were two well known Apaches leading small groups. The Apache Kid and Massai, both former Indian scouts that had served on opposing sides during Geronimo's War. The Apache Kid became a left the reservation in 1887, but he surrendered to the army in June of the same year. He remained in the civilian legal system until November 1889, when he escaped police custody during an incident known as the Kelvin Grade Massacre. Massai had been on the run since 1882, when he heard of the Apache exodus from San Carlos. After Geronimo's surrender, Massai became famous for escaping the army in Missouri, while traveling on a train to Florida with other Apache prisoners. Massai then found his way back to Arizona alone and on foot. Contemporary accounts say that Massai and the Apache Kid occasionally cooperated with each other and that most of Massai's raids into the United States may have been attributed to the Kid. According to an article by Britt W. Wilson, in the October 2001 issue of Wild West, by the mid-1890s, hostile Apache activity in southern Arizona increased. On December 3, 1895, the settlers Elizabeth Merrill and her father, Horatio Merrill, were murdered by hostiles near Solomonville and on March 28, 1896, Alfred Hands was killed at his cabin on the eastern side of the Chiricahua Mountains, near the present day town of Portal. Accounts differ, some say that the Apache Kid killed the Merrill's and Hands but Britt Wilson says it was Massai. Either way, the newspapers and Arizona citizens pressured the local authorities into doing something about the \\"renegades\\". Campaign After Hands' death, the army launched an \\"aggressive campaign\\" to catch those responsible. Civilian posses also formed to assist the army in the search. There were only two important encounters during the campaign. The first was on May 8, 1896, when a combined scouting expedition under Second Lieutenant Nathan King Averill, 7th Cavalry, found the hostiles encamped in the Peloncillo Mountains, near Lang's Ranch, southwest of Cloverdale, New Mexico. However, other accounts say the skirmish occurred in the Guadalupe Mountains of Mexico, about fifty miles south of the border. Averill reported that his men killed or wounded one Apache man and wounded a woman while the rest fled. One of the Apaches fired a few shots from behind a tree before getting away. The Americans also captured a little girl who was left behind at the camp. She was later taken in by a member of the expedition, John Horton Slaughter, who claimed that he was the one who killed the Apache and that the man he shot was the Apache Kid. Two or three days after that, Captain James M. Bell, 7th Cavalry, sent Lieutenant Sedgwick Rice out from Fort Grant, Arizona with three Apache Scouts and four soldiers. They first headed for San Simon Station, a town in San Simon Valley, and then south through the Peloncillos. On the next day, May 12, the Apache scouts detected the hostiles' trail and determined that it was made by five horses, one of which had iron horseshoes and the other four were \\"shod with rawhide.\\" The scouts said that two of the horses were ridden by woman and that only one had a man on its back. It was getting dark by that time so Lieutenant Rice decided to make camp for the night. Early the next morning, on May 13, Rice and his men continued following the trail south until, on May 14, it turned east towards the Animas Valley of New Mexico.United States War Department, pg. 143-144 Around this time, Rice met some of Second Lieutenant Averill's men, who were still scouting in the area. It was then decided that Rice would join Averill at his camp, in Guadalupe Canyon, to see Lieutenant Edwin C. Bullock, who was their superior. Before reaching the camp, Averill himself rode up to Rice and told him that the hostiles had crossed the international border about three miles west of Cloverdale. According to Britt Wilson, \\"Guadalupe Canyon [is] a natural, protected pass leading into Mexico from Arizona Territory, [and] had been used by the Apaches for a long time as an escape route.\\" During Geronimo's War, in June 1885, a small battle was fought there when Chiricahuas attacked an army redoubt and a few years before that it was the site of the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre, in which Mexican policemen killed \\"Old Man\\" Clanton and his gang of cattle rustlers. Rice believed that the hostile Apaches were still in the area so, on the next day, May 15, he and Averill left camp and proceeded down the trail with twelve enlisted men, ten Apache scouts and four civilians, including John Slaughter and his ranch foreman, Jesse Fisher. The expedition did not catch up with the hostiles that day but that night, when the soldiers were making camp, Rice sent the Apache scouts ahead of his little column to see if they could locate the enemy camp. Just as Rice hoped, on the morning of May 16, the scouts found the hostiles' camp somewhere in the canyon. In May 1896, the United States Army could not legally enter Mexican territory but the newspapers concluded that the attack did take place south of the border. Adjutant General George D. Ruggles, in Washington, D.C., requested information from Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner about the exact location of the encounter but Britt Wilson says that \\"Sumner's seemingly equivocal response neither affirmed nor denied that the fight took place in Mexico.\\" The scouts sent two men back to Rice's camp to inform him of the enemy's presence. Later Rice said that because the hostile Apaches were \\"in an exceedingly difficult position in a ledge of rock, or rather a pinnacle, about halfway up a very steep mountain,\\" he came up with a plan to surround the hostiles stealthy and cut off any possible escape routes leading down the mountainside. This would be difficult though, the May 22 issue of the Tombstone Prospector described Guadalupe Canyon as being one of \\"precipitable character... the perpendicular or overhanging rocks and abrupt declivities making it an almost impossibility to get closer than long range shot.\\" Second Lieutenant Averill took with him twelve enlisted men, three Apache scouts, and the four man posse, to move north of the hostiles' camp. From there Averill left one scout and the four civilians to cover the northern side while he, the enlisted men, and two other scouts split up to cover the eastern and the western sides. Lieutenant Rice was left to make the attack with one soldier and the seven remaining scouts. Moving into position took at least five hours but by 4:00 am, on May 17, Rice was \\"only 250 yards above the Apache camp\\" and in a place that had a \\"commanding view\\" of the natives. Rice wanted to wait until sunrise to begin the attack so he and his men would have to wait at least three more hours. By 6:00 am, the Apache women in camp \\"began moving about\\", presenting \\"easy targets\\" for the Americans and the scouts. Rice forbid his men from attacking the women, unless in self defense, because the scouts told him that the women would likely surrender if the warriors were killed. At about 7:00 am, just before sunrise, the Apache man Adelnietze appeared. Adelnietze was with Geronimo's band ten years before, but, instead of surrendering at Skeleton Canyon, he continued to live as a nomad with his family. Rice later reported that Adelnietze was \\"responding to an alarm call\\" because one of the women had seen the soldiers at the base of the mountainside. Averill then decided to move closer to the hostiles. Britt Wilson says that \\"The [second] lieutenant sent a sergeant and two other soldiers to one canyon, and he took the other men behind a peak that he assumed lay on the back side of the Apache camp.\\" When they were in position, Averill noticed a person standing atop a \\"high pinnacle\\" on the next ridge over, one of the scouts said that the person was an Apache women. Averill looked through his field glasses and saw what he thought was Rice so he moved his men to the next ridge and ordered them to make sure they didn't open fire. However, Lieutenant Rice and his men had been watching Adelnietze for a while so the order to open fire was given. Adelnietze was hit by one of the first bullets but he was able to run down the mountainside \\"through a narrow opening in the rocks,\\" followed by at least one of the women. The soldiers also fired on Massai, who, by that time, was awake and he \\"made a hasty retreat from the camp, as the troopers bullets ricocheted harmlessly off the rocks that provided him with cover.\\" Though Britt Wilson repeatedly refers to the second encounter as a \\"fight,\\" nowhere in his account does it say that the Apaches actually returned fire. Rice thought that the fleeing Apaches would run straight into Averill's command but he didn't know that Averill had split up with the posse and had spread his men out in a bad way. Averill later blamed his scouts for being unwilling to move any closer to the hostiles' camp. He quoted one as saying; \\"Camp right here, we sit down, Chericahuas [sic] hear us‚Ä¶.\\" Averill later said that Curley \\"moved very slowly and finally refused to go any further, either through fear for himself or through fear of alarming the renegades.\\" Curley responded; \\"Just by myself, without the help of another scout, it was slow trailing. They [the army] ought to have sent two or three scouts along with me to help.\\" When the shooting started, Averill had just finished hiking down to the bottom of Guadalupe Canyon. Wilson says that \\"The shots chased the three Apache women directly toward Averill,\\" but Curley scared them off by firing \\"into the air\\". Curley's account was a little different than Averill's. Curley said that as the women were running towards him he tried to point them out to Averill but he could not see. Therefore, Curley figured he should open fire to not only alarm Averill of the hostiles but to complete his objective by stopping the enemy from fleeing. No matter which account is true, the women sought shelter from the bullets behind a series of rock formations but they later got away. In Averill's official report, he blames Curley for failing to get him into the right position and for \\"warning\\" the renegades by opening fire on them. Averill also \\"expressed dissatisfaction\\" for the Apache scout he left with John Slaughter and the other three civilians. When Lieutenant Rice realized that the Apache men were escaping he could only chase after one so he followed Adelnietze's \\"very bloody trail.\\" Adelnietze escaped though and the pursuit was called off forty-eight hours later because the Apache scouts told Rice that the Apache would likely die from his wound. Rice then went back to see Lieutenant Bullock, who ordered him to keep searching for Adelnietze's body and that of the Apache said to have been wounded on May 8. The Tombstone Prospector later reported that both of the bodies were found and that much of Adelnietze's belongings were captured, including his 1873 Springfield rifle, \\"with a shortened barrel,\\" a bow, two horses, moccasins and leggings \\"filled with blood.\\" The scouts also found articles of clothing that belonged to the murdered Elizabeth Merill and her father. All of Adelnietze's belongings were found at the camp, except the leggings, which were picked up from an area of \\"ground [that] was saturated with blood.\\" Despite the fact that the Apaches got away, General Nelson A. Miles said; \\"The major-general commanding the army appreciates very highly the skill, fortitude, and perseverance of the troops‚Ä¶ and the success so far achieved‚Ä¶. First Lieutenant Sedgwick Rice and Second Lieutenant N.K. Averill, Seventh Cavalry, and the non-commissioned officers, guides and Indian scouts under their command are highly commended.\\" After May 17, there was only one other notable encounter between the United States Army and off reservation Apaches during the campaign. On June 4, 1896, the Americans received permission from the Mexican government to pursue Apaches across the international border and shortly thereafter a small expedition was sent into Sonora. On June 21, Lieutenant William Yates was leading the expedition through Pulpito Mountain, sixty miles south of the border, when he came across an Apache camp. An immediate attack was ordered, which led to the capture of a five-year-old girl, a horse, and some camping equipment. There was no fighting though and it was reported that four warriors, four women and one other child got away. American newspapers claimed the Apache scouts that participated in the expedition had warned the Apache camp before the attack began, allowing the majority time to escape. Aftermath Apache May, photographed by C.S. Fly in Tombstone, Arizona. The Apache Campaign of 1896 was the last time the United States Army would go after Apaches but, according to author and historian Lynda S√°nchez, of Lincoln, New Mexico, \\"violent episodes\\" between Apaches and American or Mexican settlers continued into the 1930s. Britt Wilson says that Massai was ambushed and killed in September 1906 by a New Mexican posse. However, others believed that the Apache Kid was the man who died that day so the area was named the Apache Kid Wilderness. The little Apache girl, captured on May 8, went to live with John Slaughter at the San Bernardino Ranch, which is now a national historic site. She was named Apache May, for the month in which she was found. Both John and his wife, Viola, believed that the Apache Kid was the father of the little girl and that she must have been about twelve months old. When found, Apache May was wearing a dress made out of Elizabeth Merill's \\"muslin election poster\\" so Viola made some new clothes for her. Accounts differ, but somehow, in 1901, Apache May's dress caught on fire. The girl was severely burned and she died the following morning. Her remains now rest at the Slaughter family cemetery, located on the ranch, and her dress has been preserved by the Arizona Historical Society.

The epithet \\"oldroydi\\" refers to Ida Shepard Oldroyd (\\"Mrs. T.S. Oldroyd\\"). Description The elongate-ovate shell is vitreous. Its length measures 3.5 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small, obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which projects the tilted edge which is marked with five raised spiral lirations. The five whorls of the teleoconch are somewhat inflated, well rounded, moderately contracted at the sutures, strongly slopingly shouldered at the summit. They are ornamented with somewhat retractive axial ribs, of which 14 occur upon the first, 16 upon the second, 18 upon the third, and 20 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the axial ribs, the whorls are marked by four spiral cords between the sutures which are as strong as the ribs and render them strongly nodulous at their junction. The second of these ribs below the summit marks the angle of the shoulder. The spaces enclosed by the ribs and cords are strongly impressed oblong pits, the long axis of which coincides with the spiral sculpture. The sutures are strongly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a spiral groove, crossed by the continuations of the axial ribs, which terminate at the posterior edge of the first basal keel. The base of the shell is well rounded posteriorly, somewhat attenuated anteriorly. It is marked by six almost equal spiral keels, which are less developed about the umbilical area. The deep grooves between these keels are crossed by numerous very slender, raised axial threads. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The shell is rendered decidedly sinuous by the spiral cords. The columella is moderately strong, decidedly reflected anteriorly. It is provided with a fold at its insertion. Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off California.

History In the early 1880s because of heavy rains, the River Brenta flooded causing huge damage in the entire area of the Sugana Valley one of the most important valleys in the then Austrian province of Trentino. Damage to the structures were heavy, and many families were made homeless. The flooding affected the valley‚Äôs economy and the whole area entered an era of depression causing a loss of jobs. In a time of limited opportunities, rebuilding Trentino was a hard process. Those who had lost their homes and jobs, had to leave the area to survive. During the coming years, there were massive emigrations of Italians; many countries offered better alternatives than home. They considered as first option to go to Brazil, where the largest Italian community abroad was. However, after having sold all their remaining assets to pay out the travel fees, the villagers found out that the man in charge with the travel arrangement had disappeared with the money, defrauding them. Unconfirmed sources suggested that the news of what had happened to those hapless people, reached the Austro-Hungarian Kaiser Franz Joseph II, who moved by compassion, offered to settle them in the newly acquired province of Bosnia. At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a region which previously belonged to the Ottoman Empire, whose population was mainly Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks. Although the Province would not be formally incorporated into the Empire until 1908, the Imperial Government followed a policy of settling loyal populations in the region. In the Imperial vision this would have granted support to the Imperial policy in case of turmoil. At the time the province of Trentino was an integral part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Therefore, the Sugana Valley families from the villages of Primiero, Aldeno e Cimone, were given lands in Bosnia. After a month of travel around 320 families arrived in Bosnia and mainly settled in the districts of Prnjavor and Banja Luka, while others settled in Hercegovina in Konjica and Tuzla districts but the latter settlements would not last long. The Sugana families settled in the area in the village of Stivor toward the end of 1882. The newly arrived soon integrated into the new territory. With the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, these ethnic Italians automatically became Yugoslavian citizens. Before the start of World War II the kingdoms of Yugoslavia and Italy negotiated an agreement regarding the Italian ethnic population living in the Yugoslav side of the Adriatic, and therefore the Italians living in the area were granted full Italian citizenship for a year, if they would have moved back to Italy, and lived there for a year. Many families took up the opportunity while many others opted to stay, especially the Trentini living in Stivor and Tuzla. (Some have argued that they were not well informed about the deal by the Yugoslav authorities, who were not anxious to show a large Italian presence in the area, which was considered to be entirely Slav.) However, as late as 1921 the number of the Italian living in the area was 292. ;After World War II After the end of World War II farming remained the predominant economic activity in the area; in the mid-1960s the country's economy prospered considerably, and many inhabitants of Stivor moved to the Yugoslav industrial cities while others migrated abroad (most of them to Australia). When Tito‚Äôs Yugoslavia ended in 1991 and the war in Bosnia broke out, some of the Stivorians escaped abroad, and many of them reached the Trentino region, their ancestral home. Since then around 530 Stivorians have re-settled in Trentino, and on March 9, 1997 the, ‚ÄùCircolo Trentini di ≈†tivor‚Äù or, ‚Äú Stivorian-Trentinis‚Äô Club‚Äù was founded in Roncegno in Trento province. To date around 270 persons of the original Italian community arrived in 1882 are still living in Stivor, BIH. They speak their original Trentino dialect, while the Italian language is taught at the local school, with a program supported by the World Trentine Association.

Biography De C√©risantis was the eldest son, Mark Duncan (1570?‚Äì1640), was for a time tutor to the Marquis de Faure, and was employed by Richelieu in certain negotiations at Constantinople in 1641; but in consequence of a quarrel with M. de Caudale was compelled to leave France, and entered the Swedish service. De C√©risantis returned to France as the Swedish ambassador resident in 1645. Shortly afterwards he left the Swedish service, renounced his Protestantism, and went to Rome, where in 1647 he met Henry II, Duke of Guise, then meditating his attempt to wrest the kingdom of Sicily from Spain, whom he accompanied to Naples in the capacity of secretary. He is said also to have been secretly employed by the French king to furnish intelligence of the duke's designs and movements. He died of a wound received in an engagement with the Spaniards in February 1648. The authenticity of the M√©moires du Duc de Guise, published in 1668, was impugned by the brother of C√©risantis, Saint Hel√®ne, mainly on the ground of the somewhat disparaging tone in which C√©risantis is referred to in them. The genuineness of the work is, however, now beyond dispute, and it must be observed that the duke, while imputing to C√©risantis excessive vainglory, gives him credit for skill and intrepidity in the field.

This is important because a DNA sequence can code for multiple polypeptides, so it is these non-DNA factors that are present in order to help determine the polypeptide that is made. The definition was first proposed by Eva M. Neumann-Held, suggesting that a redefinition of our view of the \\"gene\\" in relation to developmental genetics. This concept claims that the definition is too general. We therefore need to either clarify its definition or stop using the term \\"gene\\". In the Cycles of Contingency, Neumann-Held states, \\"This empirical evidence shows that it is not only the presence of DNA sequence that determines the course of events that lead to the synthesis of a polypeptide but, in addition, specific non-DNA factors must act on DNA and derived mRNA to determine the particular processing mechanisms.\\" The developmental state and tissue determine the outcome of the DNA. An example Neumann-Held gives of this is RNA editing. Depending on the environmental and developmental state of the organism mRNA might enhance, delete, or even add nucleotides to create a different mRNA. So according to Neumann-Held the ‚Äúgene‚Äù is the process that brings together the non-DNA elements to DNA in order to create a specific polypeptide. This process has specific interactions between certain DNA segments and certain non-DNA segments, specific mechanism for mRNA's resulting interactions with non-DNA entities, which in turn creates a specific polypeptide.

Biography Wang was born in Hemei village in Changhua County, Taiwan in 1970, growing up in a farming family with an illiterate mother and a father who only received basic education. Though his parents did not excel at explaining the world, their actions served as a model for honesty, warmth and kindness. As a youth, Wang enjoyed reading the works of Qi Jun and Yukio Mishima, and exchanged letters with the former for twenty years, discussing the giving and receiving among family and friends, as well as their shared love for various other topics. Meanwhile, the author Yukio sparked his interest in passion, immorality, and life and death. Wang graduated from Darong Elementary School, Hemei Middle School, Changhua High School, the Mass Communications Department of Fu Jen University, and the Graduate School of Taiwanese Culture of the National Taipei University of Education. He has worked for a long time in media services, and was once awarded as an editor for newspaper supplements. Wang moved north in 1988, keeping his roots firmly in the farm while exploring new possibilities in the city. Although he sought shelter in this new place, yet kept his home close to his heart. After finishing his mandatory military service in 1995, Wang worked in Taipei, where he felt like a seed that fell far from his tree, yet once he landed in this new fertile land, he gained confidence in himself and put down firm roots. In 2001 he packed up and traveled alone to England, France and Spain for almost three months, greatly expanding his worldview.

This inspired Wang, who then decided he wanted to become a true citizen of the world.  Works  Although interested in literature, art, gardening, and observing every facet of society, Wang also takes pleasure in traveling and exploring the mysteries of nature.

Cricket career He began playing cricket for the Essex Second XI in 1964 and two years later broke into their County Championship side for the first time. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, he went on to take a total of 117 first-class wickets for Essex, at an average of 29.92.

He took a career high 50 wickets in the 1968 season, which he spent playing for both Essex and Cambridge University. It was with Cambridge that he took the only five wicket haul of his career, against Sussex in 1969. Jorden dismissed five of the top six Sussex batsman in the first innings to claim figures of 5-95. He captained the university team in 1969 and 1970. He also played one first- class match for a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities team. He played Minor Counties and List A cricket for Bedfordshire from 1975 to 1977.

But I'll repudiate not a single page of it, not until I cease loving ugliness no lesser than I love harmony.\\" Reception Prince Alexander Urusov whose opinion was crucial for Balmont, did not appreciate the poet's new, aggressive brand of modernism, abhorring what he called \\"the extremes of decadence.\\" Nikolai Gumilyov greeted Balmont's new development; in the article called \\"Leaders of the New School\\", praised the emergence of \\"all those hunchbacks, demons, all things beastly and perverse that have swept away the horde of old words, all those romances and dreaming, girls and boys, flowers and sunrises.\\" References Category:1900 poetry books Category:Russian poetry collections Category:Scorpion (publishing house) books Category:Poetry by Konstantin Balmont ","title":"Burning Buildings"},{"id":"33962071","text":"The Basic Principles Committee (BPC) was a specialised committee set up on March 1949 by Khawaja Nazimuddin on the advice of prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan. The committee's sole purpose was to determine the basic underlying principles that would determine future constitutions and legislature in Pakistan. Initial recommendations and proposals suggested by the BPC were highly criticised in the local media and public. Much of the criticism came from East Pakistan where the committee proposals were said to be subversive of the ideology of Pakistan, under-representing the majority province and neglecting the Bengali language thoroughly in the constitutional and legislative process. The suggestion of the formation of a religious oversight board was also seen as \\"undemocratic [and] an insult to Islam\\". Formation Before the first constituent assembly of Pakistan could formulate any constitution or legislature, it was necessary to put in order the basic principles that would determine how the constitution should be framed. On 7 March 1949, the Objectives Resolution was passed, which serves to this day as the ground norm for constitutional process in Pakistan. The resolution was adopted by the constituent assembly on 12 March 1949. The Basic Principles Committee (BPC) was formed on the same day by the constituent assembly. The committee was set up by governor-general Khawaja Nazimuddin upon advice from prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan. It was presided over by Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan with Liaquat Ali Khan serving also as its vice-president. The committee had 24 other members, though not all were members of the constituent assembly as well. The purpose of the BPC was to formulate the basic principles based on the Objectives Resolution using which the future constitutions of Pakistan would be framed. The committee was asked to propose basic principles and concerned recommendations that would help the constituent assembly with their constitutional and legislative tasks. In order to do so, the committee had its initial two meetings in April 1949 where three distinct sub-committees were formed to deal with specialised tasks: * A sub-committee to deal with matters of federal and provincial constitution and distribution of powers; * A sub- committee to deal with matters of adult franchise; and, * A sub-committee to deal with matters of judiciary. First proposal The BPC presented its initial report to the constituent assembly on 28 September 1950. The main features presented in the report were also simultaneously published in an article in the Dawn newspaper a day later, ushering strong criticism from the public, particularly from critics in East Pakistan.See Pakistan Observer, 3, 6, 8, 11, 12 & 17 October 1950, for detailed public reaction to the report. Salient features The report called for the state of Pakistan to be a federation where Urdu was to be the state language. It also formally recognised the Objectives Resolution as an integral part of the constitution of Pakistan and the legislative process, suggesting that the resolution should be incorporated into the constitution as \\"a directive principle of [state] policy\\". The report also presented a suggestion for the central legislature was to be a bicameral with an upper house consisting of 100 members, and a lower house consisting of 400 members. The upper house was to be elected by the provincial legislature serving as the representative institution of the provinces, while the lower house was to be elected by the people on the basis of adult franchise. The tenure of both houses was to be five years with both enjoying equal power. The decisions regarding budget or monetary bills were to be decided in joint sessions of the two houses. The head of state was to be elected by a joint session of the two houses for a term of five years working on the advice of the prime minister. Federal legislature would have the authority to remove the head of state. The head of state was given added powers like the authority to abrogate the constitution and issue ordinances. Each province would have its own legislature elected on the basis of adult franchise for a term of five years. The head of the provincial legislature was to be elected by the head of state for term of five years working on the advice of the chief minister. The Supreme Court was to be the head of judiciary consisting of a chief justice and 2 to 6 judges. It was suggested to establish High Courts for each province. It was also the first time that the establishment of a religious oversight board was suggested. A board of ulema (religious scholars) was suggested to be appointed by the head of state and provincial governors to examine the processes of law making ensuring those laws to be in accordance with the Quran and the Sunnah. Legislative power was to be divided in three lists: * Federal list, comprising 67 subjects on which the central legislature would legislate; * Provincial list, comprising 35 items on which the provincial legislature would legislate; and, * Concurrent list, comprising 37 items on which both the central and provincial legislatures had the authority to legislate. The residuary powers were vested in the centre. The procedure to amend the constitution was made very rigid. It required a majority approval from the central and provincial legislatures. In case of any dispute, the Supreme Court would have the authority to interpret the constitution. Reaction and criticism These initial recommendations raised a fire-storm of protest. It was called reactionary, undemocratic, an insult to Islam, smacking of fascist approach, subversive of the ideology of Pakistan and a gross betrayal of the solemn pledges made to the people. In particular, the report was highly criticised by Sris Chandra Chattopadhyay who observed that East Pakistan, being more populous than West Pakistan, would be under-represented if both were given equal number of seats in the upper house. This would have effectively rendered the eastern province a minority. Bengali critics also voiced concern over making Urdu the national language while thoroughly neglecting the Bengali language from the constitutional arena. There was also criticism on the proposals for a strong centre with vast powers on financial matters. On 4 October 1950, in an editorial published in the Nawa-i-Waqt, the report was called a \\"charter of people's slavery\\". Amidst furious criticisms, Liaquat Ali Khan refrained from considering the report and invited the committee to present revised proposals and suggestions. He also called for general suggestions and comments from the public in order to incorporate public opinion. Another special sub-committee was formed therein to facilitate such measures. This sub-committee was headed by Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar and later presented a revised report in the constituent assembly in July 1952. Second proposal In light of the criticism received for the first proposal, the committee moved towards including a greater participation of public opinion into their successive report to the constituent assembly. An interim draft for a second report of the BPC had been finalised by the third week of November and was to be presented to the Constituent Assembly on 23 November 1952. Its presentation was however postponed at the very last minute due to reservations held by some members of the committee. The BPC held a meeting on 19 December 1952 where the final draft for the second proposal was signed. But, in the conspicuous absence of Mumtaz Daultana, Nurul Amin, Begum Jahanara Shahnawaz, A.H. Gardezi, Justice Abdul Rashid and Maulana Mohammad Akram Khan, the report was signed by Malik Shaukat Ali signed it conditionally. The report was presented to the assembly on 22 December 1952. Salient features The main features of the committee's second report focused prominently on the place of Islam in the future constitution of Pakistan. The Objective Resolution was adopted as a preamble to the proposed constitution and the principles defined therein were to guide the state. With Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar at the helm of the committee, the second proposal adopted a more Islamic stance. Some suggest it merely contained \\"religious rhetoric\\". A specific clause was added to the proposal which laid down procedures to prevent any legislation that is made outside the limits prescribed in the Quran and the Sunnah. It was suggested that existing laws be also brought in conformity with the Islamic principles. The report emphasised the importance of a board of ulema that would vet legislation to make sure that it was in keeping with the teachings of Islam. The committee also recommended that the head of state be a Muslim, and that separate electorates be maintained for Muslims and non-Muslims. During the debate concerning the proposition of the head of state being a Muslim, Sardar Shaukat Hayat Khan observed that the provision was undeniably against fundamental rights. He said, \\"I presume the country‚Äôs population to be 85 percent Muslim and if a Muslim cannot be returned as a Head of State with an 85% Muslim population where a Hindu is returned with a minority of only 15%, then that Hindu must be a saint.\\"Constituent Assembly Debates. Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, Government of Pakistan. 13 October 1953, cited in Reaction and criticism The modernists denounced the suggestion to create boards of ulemas as a \\"surrender to mullahism\\" and a \\"statutory recognition of priesthood [designed to create a] medieval theocracy in the twentieth century.\\" In a series of letters appearing in The Pakistan Times, critics condemned such proposals stating the boards would become \\"super legislatures\\" where \\"regular priestly class [would be] eager to take part in politics by virtue of their being members of that class [alone]\\". There was even more criticism surrounding the inclusion of religious rhetoric in the committee's proposals especially in the formation of the board of ulema; critics called such initiatives \\"undemocratic [and] an insult to Islam\\". Nawa-i-Waqt defended the suggestion of creating the board as being \\"utterly democratic\\".An article in Nawa-i-Waqt. 26 December 1952. On 31 December 1952, Dawn newspaper expressed concern that the committee may have exceeded the limits prescribed in the Objectives Resolution.An article in Dawn Newspaper. 31 December 1952.

The Art of the 90sNeue Galerie im K√ºnstlerhaus Archive curated by Peter Weibel at the Neue Galerie im K√ºnstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.‚Äì07.11.1993).  Exhibition and publication  Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production. ‚ÄúIt is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ‚Äô90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.‚ÄùPeter Weibel, Kontextkunst ‚Äì Kunst der 90er Jahre (K√∂ln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, False Economies: Time to Take Stock It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation KontextKunst instead of Context Art or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind's referenceActualisation of Space: The Case of Oda ProjesiKontextkunst is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst.

The character was renowned and iconic for his absurd and unrealistic storylines. The most famous of which was a long running incest storyline with fan favourite - Donna Heka (Stephanie Tauevihi). The two eventually discovered they were in no way related and married in an iconic wedding that aired on the show's 2000th episode. Other memorable storylines for the character include his romance with Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield), his two car accidents (one of which left him paralyzed), getting stabbed twice, recovering from paraplegia and losing his girlfriend as he was about to propose. The character survived the 2001 cast overhaul only for Strang to quit the show due to a \\"stress related illness\\". The character was written off in a whodunit storyline that saw his body discovered after being missing for weeks. It was eventually revealed he was murdered by his mistress' husband. The character and his romance with Donna proved highly favourable for fans, with his absurd storylines also being remembered as iconic. Rangi's death remains known as one of the most memorable deaths on the show. Creation and casting Whilst studying law, Blair Strang won the role of Rangi, who was to be a stereotypical northerner and a four-month recurring character. Strang had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for 4 or 5 other roles. Upon the soap's infamous revamp in 2000 that saw 14 characters written off, producers ensured fan favourite Rangi would stay. However Strang's girlfriend - Katrina Devine who portrayed Minnie Crozier was deeply upset as her character had been part of the axing. Strang started to clash with what he saw as poor management and decided to quit the soap shortly after the revamp. His departure was blamed on a \\"stress related illness\\" by producers. Storylines Rangi arrived to the clinic and won the job of a paramedic alongside Sam Aleni (Rene Naufahu). He started to date Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) but was traumatized by killing a man in a car crash. The arrival of his son Toka (Redmond McCarthy) and ex-girlfriend proved poor for his relationship with Rachel but the two stayed together even when Rangi had an affair with Rebecca Frost (Luisa Burgess). However, when Rangi became paralysed after a motorbike incident, the two finally split but Rachel ended up passing out drunk in her car and nearly killing the wheelchair bound Rangi. Rangi survived and resumed his romance with Rebecca after he miraculously regained his ability to walk. However, as Rangi prepared to propose, Rebecca suddenly died from a faulty heart valve. Rangi started to date fellow paramedic Donna Heka (Stephanie Tauevihi) but the romance was cut short following the revelation they were in fact siblings. Rangi had a brief affair with Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm) and was briefly accused of abusing elderly women. Rangi went into hiding and Donna helped him through the ordeal shortly before fellow paramedic Mark Shawn (Tony MacIver) was revealed as the true culprit. Rangi and Donna slept together however the two acknowledged the romance was wrong and Rangi had a brief fling with Caroline Buxton (Tandi Wright). In 1999 Rangi dated both Shivani Naran (Madeleine Sami) and Janet Maxwell (Katrina Hobbs) but as the year ended, Rangi was delighted to discover Donna was in fact a result of an affair and in no way related to him. Rangi helped clear Donna of murder. He broke up with Janet and he finally married Donna. The two decided to have children but Donna proved infertile and Rangi had to take out a loan to fund IVF. However, Rangi went missing and it was only a few days later that Rangi's body was found, he had been drowned. The police suspected suicide but Donna investigated and soon discovered Rangi had a secret double life with a woman named Adrianna (Emily Mowbray) and her husband Kim Tairoa (Patrick Kake) had murdered him when he decided to stay with Donna. Character development Relationship with Donna Stephanie Tauevihi was cast as Donna Heka, a love interest for Rangi and debuted in 1997. Initially the romance was meant to be straightforward but when an incestuous storyline was suggested, producers realized the large amount of content they could produce and a storyline where the happy couple would realize they are half siblings was conducted. The revelation caused Rangi to begin drinking and Donna to flee town. However the audience related well to the couple and when producers decided to make the two sleep again, there were no complaints from fans as were expected. Due to such high audience reaction, the paternity was unraveled in 1999, setting off a cliffhanger that saw the two possibly reconcile in the new millennium. When Donna was accused of murder, Rangi helped her through it and the two reconciled and married on the show's 2000th episode. Tauevihi enjoyed the couples marital bliss stating; \\"I had a huge storyline ... so it's nice to give that a bit of a flick, sit back and settle into post-marital domestic bliss. There are lots of soft, gentle moments between [Donna and Rangi] which is really nice to play out when you've been doing the angst-ridden, angry, pent-up, can't talk about it stuff.\\" However the happiness didn't last for the couple, and Rangi went missing only to be discovered dead. Donna discovered Rangi was cheating on her but had decided to stay with her only to be murdered by his mistress and her husband. Reception Strang was nominated for the \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" award in the 2000 TV Guide Television Awards. The character of Rangi was famous for the risky and abstract storylines he went through. Two notable storylines included the character recovering from paraplegia and dating his suspected sister. One particular storyline for the character was cut completely in that it was seen far too controversial. The storyline was to see offscreen lovers - Strang and Katrina Devine's characters - Rangi and Minnie participate in an affair whilst Rangi was dating Minnie's mother - Ellen. The incestuous relationship between Rangi and Donna proved to be one of the soap's most iconic storylines, with the wedding episode being singled out as one of Shortland Street's best bits. Rangi's death proved memorable with fans hoping the character was \\"doing a Tom Neilson\\" and would return. The death remained the last death of a core cast member for 3 years. The storyline that saw Rangi nearly die at the hands of a drunk Rachel, was voted by fans as one of the shows most iconic moments.

Since 1971, the conservatory is located in the former concert hall Gebouw voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Building for Arts and Science) and in the former hospital St. Joannes de Deo, both in the same street. Apart from these two buildings, the Nederlandse Beiaardschool (Dutch Carillon School), located in Amersfoort, is also part of the school. The Utrechts Conservatorium merged in 1987 with the Carillon School and the Nederlands Instituut voor Kerkmuziek (Dutch Institute for Church Music) into the Faculty of music of the Utrecht School of the Arts. The conservatory has five study directions: * Bachelor of Music in Jazz & Pop * Bachelor of Music in Classical Music * Historical Performance * Carillon * Musician 3.0 (experimental music) Musicians :Some known musicians who have attended the Utrechts Conservatorium: *Tristan Keuris *Janine Jansen *Herman van Veen *Wouter Hamel *Peter Kardolus *Bas Ramselaar *Gerard Beljon - Composer *Rudjer Glavurtic - Composer :Some known musicians who teach or have taught at the Utrechts Conservatorium: *Philippe Hirschhorn *Ton de Leeuw *Charlotte Margiono *Emmy Verhey *Zino Vinnikov *Piet Noordijk External links * The official HKU website Category:Music schools in the Netherlands Category:Buildings and structures in Utrecht (city) Category:Utrecht School of the Arts ","title":"Utrechts Conservatorium"},{"id":"33962307","text":"Laria may refer to: * Leucoma, a genus of moths * Laria District, a district in Peru * Laria language, an Indo-Aryan language of India ","title":"Laria"},{"id":"33962311","text":"A World of Pandemonium is the third full-length album released by The Hiatus on November 23, 2011.

Laurie Snell, (January 15, 1925 in Wheaton, Illinois ‚Äì March 19, 2011 in Hanover, New Hampshire) was an American mathematician. Biography J. Laurie Snell was the son of Roy Snell, an adventure author, and Lucille, a concert pianist. Lucille taught the three sons (Jud, John and Laurie) to play piano, cello, and violin. The family had a life-lease on a cabin in Isle Royale National Park where they would go for summer holidays.Breen/Snell Camp from Isle Royale Institute at Michigan Technological University Graduate work Snell studied mathematics at the University of Illinois with Joseph L. Doob from 1948 through 1951; Doob introduced him to martingales, an aspect of probability theory. Doob assigned such topics by having students attempt to solve a series of problems that he kept on file cards.J.L. Snell (2005) \\"Obituary: Joseph L. Doob\\", Journal of Applied Probability 42(1): 247‚Äì56 Snell earned his Ph.D. in 1951 (\\"Applications of Martingale System Theorems\\"), with Doob as his supervisor. Dartmouth College At Dartmouth College Snell became involved in a mathematics department project to develop a course on modern mathematics used in biological and social sciences. He worked with John G. Kemeny and Gerald L. Thompson to write Introduction to Finite Mathematics (1957) which described probability theory, linear algebra, and applications in sociology, genetics, psychology, anthropology, and economics. They found \\"the basic ideas of finite mathematics were easier to state and theorems about them considerably easier to prove than their infinite counterparts.\\" A French translation was made by M. C. Loyau and published in 1960 by Donod.Alg√®bre Moderne et Activit√©s Humaines Another colleague at Dartmouth, Hazleton Mirkil, joined the team to write Finite Mathematical Structures (1959) for sophomores at Dartmouth studying science. Infinite problems are considered after their finite counterparts are fully developed in the text. In 1962 the publisher Prentice-Hall issued a third book from a Dartmouth team: Kemeny, Snell, Thompson, and Arthur Schleifer Jr. wrote Finite Mathematics with Business Applications which included applications: computer circuits, critical path analysis, flow diagrams for computing and accounting procedures, Monte Carlo simulation of decision processes, reliability, decision theory, waiting line theory, a simple approach to mathematics of finance, matrix games, and the simplex method for solving linear programming problems. A second edition of the first text came out in 1966. Writings In 1959 Snell published a survey article on Markov chains.J.L. Snell (1959) \\"Finite Markov Chains and Their Applications\\", American Mathematical Monthly 66: 99‚Äì104 He worked the material into a book Finite Markov Chains with Kemeny.

It is a blazar or BL Lac object, which is an active galactic nucleus with a jet that is shooting towards the Earth. In the very- high-energy gamma ray region of the spectrum, at energies above 1011 eV (0.1 TeV), it is the brightest object in the sky. The object has a redshift of z = 0.034. The galaxy hosting the blazar was studied and catalogued by Benjamin Markarian in 1974. It was first determined to be a very high energy gamma ray emitter in 1996 by John Quinn at the Whipple Observatory. Galaxy The elliptical galaxy is located in the constellation of Hercules at right ascension 16h 53.9m and declination +39¬∞ 45'. Its visible size appears to be 1.2 by 1 minute of arc. Gamma rays The gamma rays from Mrk 501 are extremely variable, undergoing violent outbursts. The gamma ray spectrum of Mrk 501 shows two humps. One is below 1 keV and can be considered to be X rays and the other is above 1 TeV. During flares and outbursts the peaks increase in power and frequency. Flares lasting 20 minutes long with rise times of 1 minute have been measured by MAGIC. In these flares the higher energy gamma rays (of 1.2 Tev) were delayed 4 minutes over the 0.25 TeV gamma rays. This delay has led to various theories, including that space is bigger at small dimensions with a foamy quantum texture. The foam would create a variation in the speed of light for higher-energy light gamma-rays and the lower-energy radio waves and visible light. Such a variation would contradict Lorentz invariance, but could provide a clue for unification theory. However, observations of Dr. Floyd Stecker of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center of Mrk 501 and Mrk 421 demonstrated that there is no violation of Lorentz invariance. The galaxy is also variable in visible light between magnitude 14.5 and 13.6. During the discovery observations flashes at the average rate of one in seven minutes were observed. Cosmic rays (that is, fermionic or massive cosmic rays, as opposed to photons) were ruled out by the shape and size of the flashes which are small and elliptical for gamma rays. The flux for photons over 300 GeV at this point in time in 1995 was 8.1¬±1.5 x 10‚àí12 cm‚àí2s‚àí1 Black hole Blazars are likely to originate from matter falling into a black hole and possibly a binary black hole. The velocity dispersion (which is the maximum difference in the velocity toward or away from Earth) observed in the galaxy is 372 km/s which predicts a black hole mass of (0.9 ‚àí 3.4) √ó 109 M‚äô. However, dispersion of velocity was also measured as 291 and 270 km/s so the central mass may be less. A 23-day variability suggested that an object may be orbiting the central black hole with a 23-day period. Jet With very-long- baseline interferometry, the fine detail of radio waves can be seen down to milliarcsecond (mas) resolution. A central very bright single point called the core is observed. From the core an extremely high-speed blast of plasma emerges in a narrow cone shape as a one-sided jet. After 30 milliarcseconds, the jet, which is 300 pc long, does a 90¬∞ turn and fans out. The inner jet before the kink shows bright edges or a limb-brightened structure less than 10 mas wide. This is probably due to a fast-moving central part to the jet, combined with slower edges. with further detail at arXiv:astro-ph/0309285 Normally, there would be jets of gas shooting out in opposite directions. The observed jet is the one that faces the earth and projects plasma towards Earth. There is also a jet heading away from Earth called a counter jet. Close into the core, this counter jet is so much dimmer than the main jet that it is invisible in radio waves. The brightness of the counter jet is less than the main jet by a factor of 1250. This implies that the jet is relativistic with Œì about 15 (that is, the plasma is moving at 99.8% of the speed of light) and at an angle between 15¬∞ and 25¬∞ from the line of sight from the Earth. At 408 MHz, the power level is 1.81 Jy, although this is variable. Beyond 10 kpc from the core, the counter jet becomes visible, showing that the jets have become non-relativistic; that is, plasma is no longer moving close to the speed of light. The symmetrical radio emission extends to 70\\", which corresponds to 120 to 200 kpc. Catalog entries Early designations were 4C 39.49 and B2 1652+39. The Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies lists this as UGC 10599. Other designations: B1652+39 or 1H1652+398 or TeV J1653+397.

It can carry up to six passengers. Design and development The Alleks-251 has had a long development time. The project was first made public in 2003 by the Rida design bureau, who intended to make the first flight in late 2004. There were no further progress reports until the foundation of the Aviatik Alliance Company and the appearance of the near-complete prototype at the Moscow Salon in August 2009. The aircraft flew for the first time on 10 September 2010. The Aleks-251 is mostly constructed of metal, only using composites in the nosecone, engine cowlings and fin tip. It has a parallel chord, square tipped wing with a full-span combination of slotted ailerons and flaps. The parasol configuration allows the twin 127 kW (170 hp) LOM 332S inverted inline engines to be mounted forward of and under the wing, close together. The wing is braced to the fuselage with a pair of inverted V-struts to the engine mountings. The hull of the Aleks-251 has a single step and is divided into six watertight compartments. The cabin, 3.10 m (10 ft 2 in) long, 1.40 m (4 ft 7 in) wide and 1.30 m (4 ft 3 in) high seats the pilot and six passengers in three rows, the central one with three seat, the front pair just ahead of the wing leading edge but behind the propeller disks. Other seating configurations, e.g. for medical evacuation with a stretcher and two attendants, are possible. Access is by hinged transparencies. A straight edged, swept back fin carries both the horn-balanced rudder and, at about ‚Öì height, the parallel chord, strongly dihedralled tailplane. The port elevator and, in production aircraft the rudder, have trim tabs. On water the Aleks-251 is stabilized by a pair of floats, each mounted on a single strut which rotates their float to the wing tip once airborne. On land it has a fully retractable tailwheel undercarriage. The cantilever main legs rotate forwards by much more than 90¬∞ to retract the wheels into the upper nose forward of the cabin windscreen. A MVEN ballistic recovery parachute is fitted. Well before the first flight Aviatik Alliance had announced that production aircraft would have different engines, possibly turboprops, but that a choice had not yet been made.

He made his professional debut in March 2006, reaching the top makuuchi division in November 2011. He has earned three Fighting Spirit prizes to date, and has been runner-up in one tournament. He has five kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna, three earned against Harumafuji and two against Kakury≈´. The highest rank he has reached is komusubi, which he has achieved on five separate occasions, firstly in 2013. Early life and sumo background He played baseball and judo in his junior high school years, but on transferring to an industrial and science high school in nearby ≈åita Prefecture he joined the sumo club after being scouted by the coach at the school. In his second and third years he participated in two annual regional tournaments. In these tournaments, he managed to reach the best eight, but was beaten both times by future ≈çzeki Kotosh≈çgiku. In Komazawa University, he was a regular on the sumo team and managed to be runner up for the championship at a national competition. Career Early career His successes at this level garnered him many invitations from various sumo stables but chose to enter Matsugane, the stable that first approached him (it has since changed its name to Nishonoseki). He entered the professional ring in May 2006, fighting under his own surname of Matsutani. He was not able to achieve makushita tsukedashi status as he had never managed to win a national tournament before turning pro. He posted a decent jonokuchi debut with a 5‚Äì2 record. In the next tournament, he took the jonidan championship with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record and a playoff victory over fellow up-and-comer Sakaizawa. Three strong tournaments in sandanme got him promotion to the third makushita division in March, 2007. He had had a very strong showing up to this point, and had claimed he wanted to make makushita before the time for his hair to be tied up in a topknot came. He did achieve this goal, and though he started out strong with two consecutive 6-1 tournaments, as is often the case with wrestlers trying to advance through makushita, this is where he began to have trouble. He would struggle in the division for exactly three years. He began to find his stride in July, 2009. He achieved a 6‚Äì1 record and had a playoff bout against the future Akiseyama, which he lost. His sumo would grow more consistent from this point and after four more tournaments in makushita in which he had only one losing tournament, he finally qualified for the second tier j≈´ry≈ç division for the May 2010 tournament. He was only the second wrestler in thirty-three years from Komazawa University to achieve promotion to j≈´ry≈ç. In his sekitori debut he won 9 of 15 bouts and was promoted to j≈´ry≈ç #8 for the following tournament, but only managed a 6‚Äì9 record. His losing tournament would be the least of his concerns though. It was revealed on August 12, 2010 in a follow up to the June investigation into baseball gambling, that Matsutani, along with a sandanme wrestler from his stable had also been involved in gambling, but had not come forward, and had participated in the July, 2010 tournament while other wrestlers who were implicated or who admitted involvement had been suspended. He, along with his stablemate and his coach, apologized to the public in a press conference soon after. In September, the Japan Sumo Association handed down the decision not to dismiss the wrestlers, but to suspend them for two tournaments (September and November). Upon his return in the first tournament of 2011 he had fallen to makushita #51. Seemingly burning to redeem himself, Matsutani pulled off a perfect 7-0 championship, and even with the turmoil due to the following tournament being cancelled due to the match-fixing scandal he still pulled off another perfect championship in the succeeding May tournament. In many ways, this would mirror sekitori Toyonoshima's feat in previous months of bouncing back from a demotion to j≈´ry≈ç for baseball gambling by pulling off a championship in that tournament and almost pulling off a makuuchi championship in a playoff loss to Hakuh≈ç in the following tournament. Matsutani would attain re-entry to j≈´ry≈ç at a career high #3. He only managed a 7‚Äì8 record, but in the following September tournament at j≈´ry≈ç #5 would bounce back with a convincing 11‚Äì4 winning tournament. Makuuchi career On his November 2011 tournament top tier makuuchi debut, he adopted the shikona Sh≈çh≈çzan and achieved a 10‚Äì5 record. He reached what was at that time a career high of maegashira 1 in the September tournament of 2012. He had his best tournament to date in the following tournament in November, scoring ten wins and defeating three ≈çzeki. This earned him his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit. He was promoted to komusubi for the January 2013 tournament, becoming the first man from Matsugane stable to reach the san'yaku ranks since its establishment in 1990. He has since been re-promoted to komusubi three times, though he has never held the rank for more than one tournament. He won his second Fighting Spirit prize in September 2013, and also earned his first kinboshi for an upset of a yokozuna while ranked as a maegashira, defeating Harumafuji. After a disastrous 1‚Äì14 performance in the March 2015 tournament, he was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç, and was unable to get a winning record in the next tournament to return immediately to the top division. In September however he won the division with a 13‚Äì2 record and was promoted back to the top division for the next tournament. In November he produced his best performance in the top division, winning twelve matches and finishing in a three-way tie for second place: only a defeat by Aminishiki on the final day prevented him from reaching a play-off for the championship. His efforts saw him being awarded his third Fighting Spirit award. In January 2016 he defeated Harumafuji again to win his second kinboshi, but he otherwise had a relatively quiet year, and was not able to put together enough consistent performances to earn promotion back to san'yaku. In the January 2017 tournament he earned his third kinboshi, once again beating Harumafuji, and he got his fourth in March, but he remained in the maegashira ranks for the rest of the year. In May 2018 he won the Outstanding Performance prize for being the only wrestler to defeat the tournament winner, Kakury≈´. This performance was rewarded with promotion to komusubi for the first time since 2014, but he lasted only one tournament at the rank with a 3‚Äì12 record. Personal He had become known for having a very stern, almost scary visage, but in his j≈´ry≈ç entry interview people were surprised to learn he had a very expressive smiling face and a friendly way of talking.

The result was proved independently in 1926 by the French mathematician Arnaud Denjoy and the Dutch mathematician Julius Wolff. Statement Theorem. Let D be the open unit disk in C and let f be a holomorphic function mapping D into D which is not an automorphism of D (i.e. a M√∂bius transformation). Then there is a unique point z in the closure of D such that the iterates of f tend to z uniformly on compact subsets of D. If z lies in D, it is the unique fixed point of f. The mapping f leaves invariant hyperbolic disks centered on z, if z lies in D, and disks tangent to the unit circle at z, if z lies on the boundary of D. When the fixed point is at z = 0, the hyperbolic disks centred at z are just the Euclidean disks with centre 0. Otherwise f can be conjugated by a M√∂bius transformation so that the fixed point is zero. An elementary proof of the theorem is given below, taken from and . Two other short proofs can be found in . Proof of theorem Fixed point in the disk If f has a fixed point z in D then, after conjugating by a M√∂bius transformation, it can be assumed that z = 0. Let M(r) be the maximum modulus of f on z = r < 1\\\\. By the Schwarz lemma : f(z)\\\\le \\\\delta(r) z, for z ‚â§ r, where :\\\\delta(r)={M(r)\\\\over r} < 1. It follows by iteration that :f^n(z)\\\\le \\\\delta(r)^n for z ‚â§ r. These two inequalities imply the result in this case. No fixed points When f acts in D without fixed points, Wolff showed that there is a point z on the boundary such that the iterates of f leave invariant each disk tangent to the boundary at that point. Take a sequence r_k increasing to 1 and set :f_k(z)=r_kf(z). By applying Rouch√©'s theorem to f_k(z) - z and g(z)=z, f_k has exactly one zero z_k in D. Passing to a subsequence if necessary, it can be assumed that z_k\\\\rightarrow z. The point z cannot lie in D, because, by passing to the limit, z would have to be a fixed point. The result for the case of fixed points implies that the maps f_k leave invariant all Euclidean disks whose hyperbolic center is located at z_k. Explicit computations show that, as k increases, one can choose such disks so that they tend to any given disk tangent to the boundary at z. By continuity, f leaves each such disk Œî invariant. To see that f^n converges uniformly on compacta to the constant z, it is enough to show that the same is true for any subsequence f^{n_k}, convergent in the same sense to g, say. Such limits exist by Montel's theorem, and if g is non-constant, it can also be assumed that f^{n_{k+1}-n_k} has a limit, h say. But then :h(g(w))=g(w), for w in D. Since h is holomorphic and g(D) open, :h(w) = w for all w. Setting m_k= n_{k+1} - n_k, it can also be assumed that f^{m_k-1} is convergent to F say. But then f(F(w)) = w = f(F(w)), contradicting the fact that f is not an automorphism. Hence every subsequence tends to some constant uniformly on compacta in D. The invariance of Œî implies each such constant lies in the closure of each disk Œî, and hence their intersection, the single point z. By Montel's theorem, it follows that f^n converges uniformly on compacta to the constant z.

They are designed for use in rural areas, inhabited by smallholder farmers, and generally cover ten to 40 households, although some have served many more households.Multiple-use Water Schemes, Issue 11, 2011, IWMI The International Water Management Institute and International Development Enterprises collaborated on a project using MUS to help reduce poverty in India and Nepal. Between 2003 and 2008, 12 MUS systems were installed in Himalayan hilly areas serving a total of about 5000 households. A water poverty mapping technique helped identify the best areas to target. When the impact of the installed systems was evaluated, it showed that low initial investment costs (approximately US$200 per household) could be paid back within a year. This was because the households served with MUS were able to earn additional income of about US$190 per year through sale of surplus produce. In a water supply system designed for a single use, such as irrigating crops, livestock might damage hardware if they try to access the water, and people needing water for domestic uses might find there is no water provided in months when it is not needed for watering crops. These problems can be overcome when designing water supply systems for multiple uses. For example, steps can be built to provide access for bathing or washing clothes, and access points can be provided to give livestock safe access to water. Sufficient water can be supplied that there is always some available for domestic uses, even at times when the crops do not need water. Other livelihood options can also be considered; for example, using water for fisheries, as well as rearing livestock, growing crops and domestic uses. MUS can benefit women; for example, by reducing the time they have to spend gathering water and by providing water close to their home with which they can grow produce to feed their families and sell on.van Koppen, B, Moriarty, P. and Boelee, E.

He is generally described as a writer of Edinburgh, but also as an engraver. Career He gained notoriety by his bitter and often scurrilous political squibs against the whigs, but he also devoted much time and labour to copying manuscripts of antiquarian and historical interest. George Crawfurd, in the preface to his History of the Shire of Renfrew, acknowledges his indebtedness to the \\"vast collections of public records\\" belonging to Mylne, \\"a person well known to be indefatigable in the study of Scots antiquities\\". Among Mylne's other friends was Archibald Pitcairne. He was probably born in November 1643, and may have been related to Sir Robert Mylne of Barnton. Mylne married on 29 August 1678, in the Tolbooth Church, Edinburgh, Barbara, second daughter of John Govean, minister at Muckhart, Perthshire; she died on 11 December 1725, having had twelve children, all of whom, except one daughter, Margaret, predeceased their father. The eldest son, also named Robert, became an engraver, and engraved plates for Sir Robert Sibbald's Miscellanea Quaedam Eruditae Antiquitatis, and Alexander Nisbet's System of Heraldry. Many of Mylne's pasquils were separately issued in his lifetime, but others were circulated only in manuscript. From a collection brought together by Mylne's son Robert, James Maidment published, with an introduction and a few similar compositions by other writers, A Book of Scottish Pasquils, 3 pts., Edinburgh, 1827; another edition appeared in 1868. In the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, there is a pamphlet, apparently by Mylne, entitled The Oath of Abjuration Considered, 1712, 4to, and a complete manuscript catalogue of Mylne's printed broadsides. Mylne died in Edinburgh on 21 November 1747, aged 103, according to some accounts, and 105, according to others, and was buried on the anniversary of his birthday.

It was founded by Nick Brown, who also started the Nikwax waterproofing products company.  Background  During the 1980s Nick Brown became convinced that there was a fundamental flaw in the way waterproof fabrics commonly used in outdoor clothing worked, in the humid and cool, but not cold, environment in Britain. This is because the fabrics rely on a temperature and humidity gradient in order to breathe. These ideas lead to the development of Nikwax Analogy fabrics. P√°ramo Directional Clothing was founded as a company to make clothing based on the Nikwax Analogy technologies.  Ethics  P√°ramo utilises a charitable manufacturing facility in Bogota, Colombia to produce all of its technical products. The factory was begun in conjunction with a local foundation and provides skills and jobs for 'at risk women', generally women who would otherwise be involved in prostitution or illegal drug use. In addition to the socially ethical elements of the P√°ramo business model it has committed to minimising its environmental impact, all of the products are designed to be robust and repairable to last a very long time. To this end there is a policy of not using fabrics like Nylon which is not as chemically stable as Polyester in the main construction of any waterproof garments. Because of the Nikwax technologies employed none of the cleaning or treatment products used to produce or maintain P√°ramo products are environmentally persistent or toxic. P√°ramo does not use any fluro-carbons, either as a DWR treatment or as a waterproof barrier. P√°ramo also works with The World Land Trust on conservation efforts and carbon offsetting of all aspects of its operations.  Other products  P√°ramo has also added non-waterproof elements to its product line, including light weight travel clothing and over- layering synthetic insulation for use in cold and wet conditions.  Reception   Positives  There is a cult following among hill walkers, mountaineers (particularly in northern England and Scotland), certain parts of UK Armed Forces, divisions of the UK Police and Mountain Rescue Teams for P√°ramo waterproofs. Generally the garment designs are well received from a utility perspective. The waterproofs can often be carried instead of separate fleece and shell garments, reducing carried load. P√°ramo provide multiple lengths of leg for most styles of waterproof trousers in the range. The use of wash-in water repellant treatments means easy maintenance and long functional life for the fabrics.  Negatives  Nikwax Analogy fabrics by nature of their two-layer construction are generally heavier than competing systems which mainly use a monolithic impermeable layer commonly based on Polyurethane or ePTFE. This is often considered to be a major drawback in both lightweight backpacking and certain climbing applications. While effectively waterproof Nikwax Analogy fabrics are not impermeable meaning that application of enough pressure to counteract the capillary depression effect can cause garments to leak. The requirement to maintain garments, i.e. clean and proof them, is seen as a downside as it makes the user more responsible for the performance of the item. This also seen as an advantage from some perspectives. Many of the designs have been criticised for being old fashioned or unattractive. For many years P√°ramo only made garments in one or two colours and has had a mixed record in production of colours to appeal to a mainstream market. The nature of the technologies used means that there is no 'entry level' product in the range requiring a significant financial commitment from a customer to try the system in the first place.

Discovery Fossils from the Wessex Formation along a skull replica The holotype specimen of Anteophthalmosuchus, from the Wealden Group of the Isle of Wight, includes a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton. This specimen has been known since 1904 and was identified as the \\"Tie Pits specimen\\" or the \\"Hooley specimen\\" after Reginald Walter Hooley, an amateur paleontologist who had described it in 1905. Hooley had originally attributed the specimen to the previously named species Goniopholis crassidens. Additional referred specimens include a partial disarticulated skeleton and a partial skull that may represent a juvenile specimen. In 2011, Hooley's specimen was redescribed as a distinct genus and species of goniopholidid called Anteophthalmosuchus hooleyi. The genus name means \\"forward-pointing eye crocodile\\" because the specimen's eye sockets are positioned high on the skull and angle forward rather than to the side as in most other flat-skulled crocodyliforms, and the species name honors Hooley. Features that distinguish A. hooleyi from Goniopholis crassidens include the lack of a hole in the lower jaw called the mandibular fenestra, very wide supratemporal fenestrae (openings) on the skull table, and a bone above the eye socket called the palpebral that is small and does not extend over the socket as in some other goniopholidids. A. epikrator skull Two specimens from Bernissart, Belgium, collectively referred to as \\"Dollo's goniopholidid\\", was referred to A. hooleyi in a 2016 redescription. The specimens, which consist of complete skeletons (one missing the skull) from the Sainte-Barbe Clays Formation, were originally referred to Goniopholis simus by Dollo. In 2016, they were recognized as specimens of A. hooleyi due to their distinctive eye sockets, among other defining characteristics of the species. While the Dollo specimens do not possess frontal bones that are pointed at the rostral end, a trait in 2011 to establish A. hooleyi as a distinct species, and also differs in the relative proportions of the occipital condyle and foramen magnum, the authors considered these traits invalid diagnostic characteristics, as they could be a consequence of age differences or preservational artifacts. However, in 2017, Dollo's goniopholidid was moved to a new species, Anteophthalmosuchus epikrator, based on comparisons with newly-discovered specimens from the Isle of Wight. A second species, Anteophthalmosuchus escuchae, was first described and named by A.D. Buscalioni, L. Alcal√°, E. Esp√≠lez and L. Mampel in 2013. It is known solely from the holotype AR-1-1097 which consists of a partial skull. It was collected from the early Albian-aged Escucha Formation, at Santa Maria Mine located in the municipality of Ari√±o, Teruel Province, of Aragon, along with the closely related Hulkepholis plotos. Description At an estimated in length, A. hooleyi would have been the largest crocodyliform in the Wealden faunal assemblage, larger than the contemporaneous species Hylaeochampsa vectiana, Leiokarinosuchus brookensis, and Vectisuchus leptognathus. Phylogeny Illustration of \\"Dollo‚Äôs goniopholidid\\", 1882 Anteophthalmosuchus hooleyi was included in a phylogenetic analysis of goniopholidids that was published soon before the specimen was redescribed. The Hooley and Dollo specimens were found to be the closest relatives of a specimen called \\"Hulke's goniopholidid\\", now named Hulkepholis willetti.

A horn analyzer is an test instrument dedicated to determine the resonance and anti-resonance frequencies of ultrasonic parts such as transducers, converters, horns/sonotrodes and acoustic stacks, which are used for ultrasonic welding, cutting, cleaning, medical and industrial applications. In addition, digital horn analyzers are able to determine the electrical impedance of piezoelectric materials, the Butterworth-Van Dyke (BVD)equivalent circuit and the mechanical quality fator (Qm). Horn analyzer test results of a 20-kHz welding converter. The frequency ‚ÄúF‚Äù corresponds to the operational anti-resonance frequency, and the impedance ‚ÄúZ‚Äù to the electrical impedance modulus in the anti-resonance frequency. Principles of operation A digital horn analyzer performs a frequency sweep while monitoring the current flowing through the device under test, in order to detect the resonance and anti-resonance frequencies and their respective electrical impedances. The anti-resonance is the frequency at which the current encounters maximum impedance, and the resonance is the frequency of minimum impedance. In analog microampere-meter-based horn analyzers, the user identifies the frequencies manually, using the meter to detect the points of minimum and maximum current while sweeping the driving frequency. In digital analyzers, frequency detection and impedance calculation are performed automatically through embedded software. Impedance analyzers can be used as advanced horn analyzers, but are not usually a cost-effective alternative for everyday industrial demands, due to their higher cost, larger size and greater complexity. Applications Horn analyzers are widely used by manufacturers of power ultrasonic equipment, to allow the proper tuning and quality control of sonotrodes, transducers and boosters. Devine, J. (2011). Ultrasonic Plastic Welding Basics. Sonobond Ultrasonics Inc. Horn analyzers are also employed by end-users for preventive and corrective maintenance. Tuning Accurate frequency tuning is indispensable for the proper use of power ultrasonic equipment.Prokic, M. (2004). Piezoelectric Transducer Modelling and Characterization. MP Interconsulting. 269p. In an acoustic set, the parts act like narrow pass-band filters, and their central frequencies should be perfectly aligned to avoid heating losses and to improve energy transmission.

Early life and career The blond-haired and blue-eyed Morato was born on July 3, 1887 in the picturesque seaport of Alicante on the Mediterranean coast of Spain to Francisco Morat√≥ Arab√≠ and Josefa Bernab√©u Ferrer. His father was a ship captain who sailed from Spain to the Philippines and frequently stopped at the coastal town of Calauag, Tayabas. An only son, Tomas was brought to Calauag in 1898 by his father. There the 13-year-old boy first met and studied with the 22-year-old Quezon. Tomas finished his engineering course and entered the lumber business where he amassed quite a fortune. By virtue of a provision in the Treaty of Paris which granted Filipino citizenship to all Spaniards who have decided to stay in the Philippines, Morato became a Filipino citizen. Friendship with Quezon It was in Baler where he met Manuel L. Quezon, the 2nd President of the Philippines, and became friends with him. His friendship with Quezon was a rare and unique one. They courted girls together and helped each other during difficult times. President Manuel L. Quezon (1935-1944) climbs up the grand staircase of Malaca√±an Palace with aide-de-camp Col. Manuel Nieto and Presidential Guard Battalion Commander Col. Manzano. When Quezon was elected president in 1935, he entered Malaca√±ang for the first time with Morato and Manuel L. \\"Nonong\\" Quezon, Jr. And thereafter, Morato was one of the very few people who could enter Malaca√±ang at all times, even staying overnight in some often cases. Quezon himself urged Morato to enter politics, so he ran as Mayor of Calauag and won with ease. At his second term, Quezon invited him to help build a new city, a city that would later be known as Quezon City. Mayor of Quezon City Morato was a leader full of energy, taking difficult tasks that hinders growth and progress of the new city. Even though his administration faced low funds, it was able to create a network of new roads, and maintenance of satisfactory health conditions. With a police force of 48, crime rates remained at controlled levels. He also promoted social and economic programs to alleviate the condition of the residents. The first musical piece composed for Quezon City was the ‚ÄúQuezon City March‚Äù, which was composed by Amando Calleja and the lyrics made by Jesus Balmori. The sponsors of this musical piece were the officials and members of the Cubao Women‚Äôs Club headed by Morato's wife. He was arrested by the Imperial Japanese troops was entered in Quezon City Hall by the enemy hands during their occupation and ended the term as mayor of the city and became parole and exile on July 19, 1942 during World War II. Death He died on March 6, 1965, his remains were interred at Manila North Cemetery. Legacy The popular restaurant row Tomas Morato Avenue, as well as a road in San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City were named after him. A barangay (Don Tomas) and a street in Calauag, Quezon, were also named in memory of the last municipal President and first municipal Mayor of Calauag, Quezon.

Most famously known for his 3-D Style pumpkin carvings, Villafane also sculpts action figures and collectibles, sand and snow. Career Villafane was born in Queens, New York, and was raised on Long Island. He graduated from the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York City in 1991. From 1993 to 2006 he was an art teacher in Bellaire, Michigan for kindergarten through twelfth grade students. Villafane started sculpting part-time in clay and wax in 2004 as a freelance sculptor in addition to teaching. His overnight success allowed for him to resign from teaching in 2006 to pursue a full-time sculpting career. Some newly acquired techniques took Villafane's hobby of pumpkin sculpting to a whole new level and also expanded his career to other mediums such as sand, snow and other fruits and vegetables.  Collectibles and Actions Figures  Villafane's first \\"practice\\" sculpture actually became his first professional sculpture. In 2004, he sculpted a Logan version of the Marvel character Wolverine. The sculptor Randy Bowen of Bowen Designs contacted Villafane and offered to produce his statue. Between 2004 and 2005, Ray went on to sculpt several other statues for Bowen Designs including other Marvel characters such as Sabretooth, Magneto, and The Punisher. He continued to pick up new clients such as McFarlane Toys and Sideshow Collectibles before signing exclusively with DC Comics. DC Comics toy division DC Direct, inked a two-year contract with Villafane in 2006. He renewed his contract in 2008 for another two years, sculpting action figures and collectible statues. Villafane presently continues to freelance working alongside other clients such as Hasbro and Blizzard Entertainment.  Pumpkins  In 2007 Villafane was contacted by High Noon Entertainment and asked to participate in the Food Network's Challenge Show for a segment called \\"Outrageous Pumpkins\\". He competed against three other professional pumpkin sculptors and won all three rounds to receive the grand prize. The Food Network contacted Villafane again in 2009 to come back to the show and defend his title. He was also the grand prize winner for the \\"Outrageous Pumpkin Challenge II\\". In 2011, he carved the world's biggest pumpkin to resemble zombies. He also provided pumpkins for Heidi Klum's annual Halloween party in Sin City in 2011.  Sandsculpture  After seeing Villafane's performance on Food Network carving pumpkins, a Florida-based sandsculpting company, Sultans of Sand, contacted Villafane to see if he had ever tried his hand at sandsculpting. His first attempt yielded positive results and led to further invitations to sandsculpt around the world. Villafane has taken part in sandsculpting events in the seaside resort town of Jesolo, Italy, twice ‚Äî in the summer of 2009 creating the show's main masterpiece, Dante's Inferno, and in 2010 creating a Nativity scene. He was commissioned by St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, Russia, to sculpt alongside other sandsculptors from around the world. He also competed in the World Championship of Sandsculpting in Federal Way, Washington, in September 2010, taking first place in the double's category alongside John Gowdy.  Media  In 2010, CBS News with Katie Couric sent their segment producer Steve Hartman to record one of his \\"Assignment America\\" segments on Villafane's pumpkins, where he refers to Villafane as \\"the best pumpkin carver in the world\\". In addition to the Food Network Challenge shows, Villafane also participated in the Food Network mini-series Halloween Wars that aired in October 2011. Villafane was also a guest on The Martha Stewart Show in 2011 to teach Martha the 3-D pumpkin carving style, and where she referred to him as \\"the Michelangelo of pumpkin carving.\\"The Martha Stewart Show (October 19, 2011).

At the end of the episode this suspicion is confirmed as she gets another note which reads 'You're welcome'. Gabrielle searches for Carlos who checked himself out of rehab. She returns home to discover him passed out in bed and tries to see if he can remember the previous night as she is concerned he may have run over Chuck. Not only can he not remember but they cannot find his car. During Chuck's funeral a policeman recognizes Carlos because he came into the station and said he had to make a confession about beating someone with a candlestick, but Gaby covers for him by saying they had a domestic dispute but that neither wishes to press charges. After realizing that Carlos was not responsible, he promises to check back into rehab. Tom is angry with Lynette for letting herself get involved but promises to help her. He confides in Bob in case she should need a lawyer, but they both think they are in the clear when they find out about Chuck's death. Tom spends the night with Lynette and the kids and they seem to grow closer but, after a discussion about Jane, Lynette encourages him to go to Paris and see if she can make him happy as that was the reason behind their separation.

De Wael and his brother Lucas had established a workshop in Genoa in 1628 which had become the centre of the colony of Flemish artists who resided in or passed through the city. These Flemish artists could take advantage of the work and artistic activity that the brothers' workshop attracted.Alison Stoesser, Lucas and Cornelis de Wael: Flemish artists in Antwerp, Genoa and Rome in the seventeenth century, vol. 1: Text, unpublished doctoral dissertation [2008] Van Eyck's master Andries van Eertvelt had also worked in Genoa with the de Wael brothers in the period from 1628 to 1630.Andries van Eertvelt at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was in Madrid in 1649 and 1650 where he was briefly working for the court.

Work Naval Battle between Turks and Maltese Van Eyck was a marine specialist. His paintings comprise the whole range of marine painting including marine battles, storms, shipwrecks, views of ships in rivers, coastal waters and ports, etc. He painted various types of ships, including Turkish galleys with Turkish figures on them.Het Gulden Cabinet, p. 367, 1660, Cornelis de Bie He worked in the Flemish mannerist tradition of his master Andries van Eertvelt.Gaspar van Eyc, Mediterranean Coast Scene at the Maritime Museum His paintings are typically small-sized with tiny figures engaging in diverse actions and poses. Air and water acquire in his works a blurred and transparent quality, thus creating the impression that the works are unfinished. A closer view of his paintings shows the delicacy of the representation. Van Eyck worked closely with Giovanni di Filippo del Campo, who added the figures to his marines. While in Spain, van Eyck and del Campo worked for Flemish collectors based in Madrid, such as the Duke of Aarschot, who generously sponsored his work, and contributed to the distribution of his paintings in Spain. Three pictures by him are in the Museo del Prado. They did not enter the royal collection until the 18th century, through the collection of Charles IV. At least two of them are dated 1649, suggesting a presence of his work in Spain since the 17th century. In these three canvases he shows his knowledge of southern European painting, both in the Italianization of some details and in certain loans from the work of Claude Lorrain and hints of the Battle of Ostia by Raphael. These traits are visible in the Naval Battle between Turks and Maltese.

Williamson Ltd. She became a chorus girl, appearing in Whirled into Happiness in 1924. She was quickly dubbed \\"Australia's loveliest girl\\". Longstaff described her as ‚Äúmore English than Australian, her lovely coloring and features, combined with character and high intelligence, give her very high rank among the many beautiful women I have seen.‚Äù Harcourt recognised the opportunity of advancing her career and undertook to do intensive elocution lessons, saying \\"I don't care how hard I have to work so long as I amount to something in the end.\\" Harcourt received requests for her photo from international newspapers so they could place her face alongside their own beauties. Harcourt started modelling and not long after arriving in Melbourne, was already working as a mannequin for Buckley and Nunn. Jessica Harcourt in 1924 Harcourt made her cinema debut as Sara Purfoy in For the Term of His Natural Life. Filming commenced in 1926 and locations included Port Arthur and Launceston, Tasmania and Master Pictures' studio in Bondi, NSW. Of her performance, the director Norman Dawn said Harcourt had \\"acted capitally\\" in an emotional scene and \\"her film prospects were good\\". In an interview with the Australian Women's Weekly, Harcourt recalled her surprise at being cast as Sarah Purfoy. She said \\"...when it was offered to me, I was astounded. I still am! Most of the actresses in Sydney wanted it and there I was, 19, with no acting experience, and I got it!\\" Not long after completing filming, Harcourt was off with Norman Dawn to Suva, Fiji to film an adaption of Beatrice Grimshaw's novel Conn of the Coral Seas, a tropical comedy/drama. The filming on location was to include \\"500 war canoes and outriggers and 2000 native warriors dancing in full war dress with clubs and spears\\". Filming was to take six weeks and Harcourt made it back to Australia in time for the premiere of her first movie For the Term of His Natural Life. The film was released as The Adorable Outcast and had limited box office success. In 1928 Harcourt was cast as widow Ruby Russell in the movie The Russell Affair which was filmed in and around Sydney, including Hyde Park and the private homes of socially prominent Sydney families.\\"WOMAN'S WORLD.\\" Examiner (Launceston, Tas) 9 Sep 1932: 10 Edition: DAILY 6 Dec 2011  Portraits of Harcourt  Longstaff painted several portraits of her, one of which hung in the National Gallery in London.

He was born in the late 1420s at Hohenbaden Castle in Baden-Baden. His exact birth date is unknown. He was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church in 1769.  Life  Bernard II of Baden grew up in a deeply religious family. His father, for example, founded Fremersberg Abbey and expanded the Collegiate Church in Baden-Baden. Bernard II received a careful education, which would prepare him for his later role as a sovereign. The intent was that he would be Margrave of Pforzheim, Eberstein, Besigheim and several districts in the northern part of the Margraviate. Bernard II was related to the Habsburg dynasty via his older brother Karl I, who had married Catherine of Austria, a sister of Emperor Frederick III. This relationship should give Bernard access to the imperial court. But first, he assisted his uncle Ren√© of Anjou in an armed conflict in northern Italy. According to contemporary sources, he fought bravely. After his father's death in 1453, he returned to Baden, where he agreed with his brother to give up his claim to part of the margraviate.Volker Hasenauer: Ritter und frommer Diplomat, in: Konradsblatt, issue of 23 January 2011, p. 20-23 Instead, he became Frederick III's personal envoy, despite his young age. Bernard II saw a number of disgraceful situations and tried to alleviate hardship and poverty wherever he could. He spent most of his income assisting the poor and those in need. Even during his lifetime he impressed his contemporaries with his unusual piety. Under pressure, after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, the imperial Habsburg family began preparing a crusade against the expanding Ottoman Empire. Bernard II was sent to the European princely houses to promote this project. He died of the plague during one of these visits, on 15 July 1458 in Moncalieri in northern Italy. Bernardo, as they call him, is revered to this day by many people in this region.  Aftermath  Babenhausen, donated by Sibylle of Baden. Bernhard II of Baden is on the left wing on the inside His grave in the St. Mary's Church in Moncalieri quickly became the destination of pilgrimages by devout Christians. Allegedly, many miraculous healings occurred at his grave. He was beatified in 1769. On the occasion of Bernard's beatification, Margrave August Georg Simpert constructed the Bernhardus fountain in Rastatt. Allegedly, having Bernhard canonized was considered too expensive.Rika Wettstein: Baden-Baden - Der ultimative Stadtf√ºhrer - Markgraf Bernhard von Baden, 2001, viewed on 30 Januar 2011 After his beatification, the Catholic Margraviate of Baden-Baden chose him as its patron saint and celebrated this event on 24 July 1770; the Archdiocese of Freiburg still reveres him today as its patron. At least one miracle is said to have taken place in Freiburg.Badische Zeitung of 15 January 2011: Bernhard von Baden soll heiliggesprochen werden His feast day is 15 July. His great- niece, Sibylle of Baden, who was married to Count Philipp III of Hanau- Lichtenberg, founded a high altar in the St. Nicholas church in Babenhausen on which Bernhard is shown on its left wing on the inside.

In reflection seismology, a polarity reversal or phase change is a local amplitude seismic attribute anomaly that can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons and is therefore known as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. It primarily results from the change in polarity of the seismic response when a shale (with a lower acoustic impedance) overlies a brine-saturated zone (with a high acoustic impedance), that becomes invaded with an oil/gas sand (with the lowest acoustic impedance of the three). This changes the acoustic impedance contrast from an increase to a decrease, resulting in the polarity of the seismic response being reversed - as per the normal convention adopted by the SEG. Occurrence For a polarity reversal to occur, the shale has to have a lower acoustic impedance than the water sand and both are required to have a higher acoustic impedance than the oil/gas sand. This is the intermediate situation, that occurs during sediment compaction with depth, between the acoustic impedance relationship required for a bright spot and the acoustic impedance relationship required for a dim spot.

It is owned by the University of Southern California. KDFC is the radio home of the San Francisco Symphony and the San Francisco Opera. The station's live stream is available on the Internet and through the station's mobile app. KUSF history From 1963 until 2011, KUSF was a student-run broadcast station owned by the University of San Francisco. The station was located in the basement of Phelan Hall on the University of San Francisco campus, and was funded by the University of San Francisco, local and merchant underwriting, individual donations, and foundation grants. KUSF began in 1963 as a campus-only AM station managed by the Associated Students of the University of San Francisco (ASUSF). In 1973, USF was offered KCMA, the FM radio station of Simpson Bible College, a small local Bible college that wished to discontinue its radio operations; KCMA had signed on in 1964. USF accepted the offer and on April 25, 1977, KUSF became an FM station broadcasting on the 90.3 frequency; the call letters had been changed over shortly after the university became the licensee, on August 20, 1973. The old AM station later became the student-managed KDNZ. Originally broadcasting six hours a day, KUSF began broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1981. In its early days KUSF was a conventional college station, broadcasting programs of interest to the university and greater San Francisco community. However, KUSF soon garnered attention by playing new underground music: it was one of the first radio stations to play punk rock. Many now-famous acts also first gained exposure on KUSF, most notably The B-52's and Metallica. KDFC history KDFC was founded in 1948. Bill Crocker founded the station and was its first general manager. Sales were handled by Ed Davis, who later became the station's long-running general manager. Engineering was handled by Herbert Florance. The initials of their last names gave the radio station its call sign. It has programmed classical music for most of its history, though at one point during the 1950s, it featured a beautiful music format. For many years the programming, which was largely automated after 1976, was simulcast on KIBE 1220 AM, a 5 kW AM station in Palo Alto, California that began broadcasting in 1949 from a transmitter near the western approach to the Dumbarton Bridge. Ed Davis' company Sundial Broadcasting sold the AM and FM to Brown Broadcasting in 1993 for US$15.5 million. In 1996, Brown Broadcasting sold the FM station and AM simulcast sister station (KDFC 1220 AM) to Evergreen Media, who in turn sold the FM to Bonneville Broadcasting and the AM to Douglas Broadcasting in 1997. New station management transitioned KDFC's programming to a more mass- appeal approach, which boosted ratings significantly, though was occasionally criticized for their new \\"top 40 of classical music\\" approach. Bill Leuth, who had done mornings on rival classical station KKHI, moved to mornings at KDFC in 1997 and also contributed to the station's rise and shift from automation to live hosts. In 2003 KDFC became the first station in the Bay Area to broadcast using HD Radio. On January 18, 2007, Bonneville signed an agreement with Entercom Communications Corporation to trade three San Francisco stations ‚Äî KOIT, KMAX-FM, and KDFC ‚Äî for three Entercom stations in Seattle, Washington and four in Cincinnati, Ohio. Entercom officially took ownership of KDFC in March 2008. On January 18, 2011, the University of Southern California announced the purchase of KUSF (90.3 MHz) from the University of San Francisco (USF) and KNDL (89.9 MHz) in Angwin, California. It also announced the purchase of the intellectual property and call letters of KDFC from Entercom, moving its programming to those two stations and making it a listener- supported non-commercial outlet. KUSF was renamed KOSC, and KNDL was renamed KDFC. In turn, Entercom flipped the 102.1 MHz frequency to a simulcast of San Jose station KUFX, which Entercom had acquired earlier in the month, on January 24. KUSF turned into an online-only radio station. The Federal Communications Commission officially transferred the 90.3 MHz license to the University of Southern California on June 7, 2012. On May 1, 2017, the KDFC call sign moved to 90.3 FM in San Francisco, swapping call signs with 89.9 FM in Angwin, which became KOSC. Programming KDFC broadcasts classical music 24 hours a day. Programming features include: Mozart In the Morning, the Island of Sanity, and San Francisco Symphony broadcasts. KDFC also airs recordings of San Francisco Opera productions. In addition to FM and SHOUTcast MP3 streaming, KDFC was the first radio station in the country to broadcast in digital HD Radio, offering a secondary HD Radio channel, KDFC-2, featuring longer classical pieces and vocal works, without commercials on their former 102.1 FM frequency. A multiple winner of the award for public service, KDFC is an active partner to arts groups and an active advocate for music education. Proceeds from the station's annual CD sampler, and the annual 'Music Educator of the Year' support and celebrate public school music programs. Additional frequencies The programming of KDFC is also transmitted by these stations and translators to widen its broadcast area. * KOSC ‚Äî 89.9 FM, licensed to Angwin, California * KXSC ‚Äî 104.9 FM, licensed to Sunnyvale, California * KDFG ‚Äî 103.9 FM, licensed to Seaside, California * K212AA ‚Äî 90.3 FM, licensed to Los Gatos, California * K223AJ ‚Äî 92.5 FM, licensed to Lakeport, California On-air personalities *Mark Edwards *Blake Lawrence *Rik Malone *Dianne Nicolini *Robin Pressman *Hoyt Smith *Dale Starkey *Ray White *John Evans *Betsy O'Connor *Dusti Rhodes *Linda Cassidy Controversy In January 2005, a national controversy erupted when KDFC refused to sell advertising to the gay dating service \\"8 Guys Out,\\" while taking advertisements for the heterosexual dating service \\"Table for Six\\". Speculation was that since KDFC's then-owner, Bonneville International Corporation, was a Mormon-controlled company, the church connection led to the advertising ban. In this light, the policy of then-owner Bonneville did not allow advertising for liquor, lotteries, or casinos. In March 2007, KDFC pulled a commercial for Chris Hedges' book American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War on America. The ad was tailored to play only in the Bay Area, to promote local appearances by the author. Bill Lueth, KDFC's operations and program director insisted that pulling the ad was not a free-speech issue. \\"We don't have any issue with their right to advertise this book. It simply doesn't fit the expectation of our listeners on this particular radio station,\\" Lueth said.

It offers good views across Fishguard Bay to Fishguard Harbour.

This is the only building by the beach itself, and has seen some 500 years of use (although it closed for a period from 1994).The Rough Guide to Wales, 2009, p.201 Formerly called the Sailors Safety, it supposedly dates from 1593, the name referring to the light it once kept burning as a guide to ships.Do Pembrokeshire - Pwllgwaelod It was visited by Dylan Thomas at least once. A harbour Pwllgwaelod was at times used as a sheltered harbour when strong winds from the east made Fishguard dangerous. There is a medium-sized \\"three-quarter\\" lime kiln by the beach, used for converting the limestone brought in by boat to quicklime. This was used on the land, in this case on Dinas Island. In literature Pwllgwaelod is mentioned in \\"Sailing directions for the West Coast of England\\" , published by the Admiralty Hydrographic Department in 1870 : :There is a similar but smaller beach, the Pwll-gwaelod, which terminates a small strip of swamp that lies within Dinas head, and almost insulates it. This beach has better shelter than that of Goodie*, and small vessels frequently beach upon it in fine weather and easterly winds. (* ie. Goodie Sands, by Fishguard) In \\"A Book of South Wales\\" , published in 1905, Sabine Baring-Gould wrote: :Now the story goes that under the sea by Dinas Point, in Pwll Gwaelod, lies a fairy city inhabited by a mysterious people called the Bendith y Mamau (the Blessing of the Mothers). When the sea is calm, through the crystal waters can be seen the golden roofs and spires and marble palaces of the underwater folk. The vision lasts for from five to ten minutes at a time. One day a ship of a Dinas fisherman cast anchor in the Pwll, when up the chain came swarming one of these subaqueous people, who stepped on deck and said to the captain, \\"What is this that you are doing? Your anchor is in the roof of my house.\\" The captain promised to disengage it and not cast anchor there again.

He defended his Doktor nauk thesis in St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences in 1982.V. Ivrii' C.V. Scientific Contributions Weakly hyperbolic equations His first main works were devoted to the well- posedness of the Cauchy problem for weakly hyperbolic equations. In particular he discovered a necessary (later proven to be sufficient) condition for Cauchy problem to be well-posed no matter what the lower terms in the equation are.V. Ya. Ivrii, V M Petkov, Necessary conditions for the Cauchy problem for non- strictly hyperbolic equations to be well-posed, Russian Math. Surveys, 1974, 29 (5), 1‚Äì70 Propagation of singularities In a series of papers he explored propagation of singularities of symmetric hyperbolic systems inside of the domain and near the boundary. He was invited to give a talk at ICM‚Äî1978, Helsinki but was not granted an exit visa by the Soviet authorities;International Congress of Mathematicians#Soviet participation however his talk was published in the Proceedings of the Congress. Asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues His work in propagation of singularities logically guided him to the theory of asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues (a subject he has been studying ever since). V. Ivrii's debut in this field was a proof of Weyl conjecture (1980). Then he developed a rescaling technique which allowed to consider domains and operators with singularities. He again was invited give a talk at ICM‚Äî1986, Berkeley but again was not granted an exit visa by the Soviet authorities. His talk was read by Lars H√∂rmander and published in the Proceedings of the Congress. V. Ivrii wrote three research monographs Precise Spectral Asymptotics for Elliptic Operators Acting in Fiberings over Manifolds with Boundary, 1984, 238pp, Microlocal Analysis and Precise Spectral Asymptotics, 1998, 731pp and Microlocal Analysis, Sharp Spectral Asymptotics and Applications, 2019, * Volume I.

The line aw represents a muscle fiber of length m with its origin at w and insertion into an aponeurosis (TT') at a. The fiber shortens to length m' and moves its insertion the distance d to point b. Note that the shortening muscle fiber does not pull the aponeurosis along the line of action of the fiber but rather rotates around its origin. This is because the 3-dimensional structure of the muscle resists inward movement of the aponeurosis so that the distance between the fiber origin and the aponeurosis remains constant. For a very small shortening of the muscle, the distance ac represents the shortening of the muscle and is equal to ab*cosŒ¶ where Œ¶ is the instantaneous pennation angle. For a pennate muscle, cosŒ¶ is always less than 1, meaning that the distance ac is always shorter than the distance ab, thus the muscle fiber shortening is 'amplified' by a factor of 1/cosŒ¶. Architectural gear ratio, also called anatomical gear ratio (AGR) is a feature of pennate muscle defined by the ratio between the longitudinal strain of the muscle and muscle fiber strain. It is sometimes also defined as the ratio between muscle-shortening velocity and fiber- shortening velocity. AGR = Œµx/Œµf where Œµx = longitudinal strain (or muscle- shortening velocity) and Œµf is fiber strain (or fiber-shortening velocity) In fusiform muscle, the fibers are longitudinal, so longitudinal strain is equal to fiber strain, and AGR is always 1. As the pennate muscle is activated, the fibers rotate as they shorten and pull at an angle. In pennate muscles, fibers are oriented at an angle to the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. Force output is dependent upon the angle of fiber rotation, so changes in muscle thickness and the vector of change in thickness vary; based upon the force being produced. Due to the rotational motion; pennate muscles operate at low velocities (low shortening distance). The shortening velocity of the pennate muscle as a whole is greater than that of the individual fibers. This gives rise to the property of AGR. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). Azizi and Brainerd demonstrated that the gear ratio of pennate muscle can vary; dependent on external load. Segmented musculature, like pennate muscle, has fibers aligned at an angle and due to this feature of design, when muscle fibers increase in angle with respect to the medial axis, along with the direction and amount of muscle bulging, the Architectural gear ratio increases. A variable gear ratio, based upon different anatomical position, loading and movement conditions, has since been dubbed spatially varying gear ratio. The occurrence of spatially varying gear ratio gives rise to a new insight of muscle biology; ‚Äúinhomogenous muscle mechanics.‚Äù One feature of the ratio is that there is an optimal gear ratio for each muscle; as the length-tension and force-velocity relationships describe. Length-tension refers to the max tension that can be created over the muscle fiber strain range and force-velocity refers to the power that is possible of the fiber compared to the shortening velocity. These two features of musculature help to define an optimal AGR for a muscle. Muscle model The Architectural gear ratio is explained through the segmented muscle model 3 proposed by Emanuel Azizi, where a muscle segment is shown as a single muscle fiber attached to the myosepta of a Siren lacertina an aquatic salamander at a certain acute, pennation angle. The model allows segments to bulge out differently in the horizontal, and vertical direction and was used to calculate the Architectural gear ratio of each segment. Preliminary models results show that with muscle bulging, the Architectural gear ratio will increase. Different bulging conditions were studied, and shown in Fig. 2 The model results show the more a muscle bulges in dorsoventral height, the further the muscle fibers shorten, therefore providing a higher Architectural gear ratio. In pennate muscles, segments with higher pennation angles put out less force per shortening muscle fiber. Therefore, the architectural gear ratio of a pennate muscle is higher than the architectural gear ratio of spindle like muscles (e.g. fusiform). A smaller fiber length neutralizes this higher architectural gear ratio if the muscle fibers must be squeezed into the same space. Pennation angle and muscle injury The rotator cuff comprises four pennate muscles, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor, and their accompanying tendons. These muscles form a cuff around the glenohumeral joint and function to stabilize and manipulate the shoulder.Zuo J, Sano H, Itoi E. Changes in pennation agnle in rotator cuff muscles with torn tendons. J Orthop Sci. 2011. The pennation angle of the rotator cuff myofibers, the angle at which fibers connect to the associated tendon, affects the contractile properties and function of the whole pennate muscle. For example, the pennation angle determines the architectural gear ratio at which a pennate muscle operates. A large initial pennation angle results in a large AGR and velocity amplification. A 2011 study on human cadaveric shoulders suggests tendon tears may affect the pennation angle of the rotator cuff muscles. Researchers compared pennation angle between a control group and tear groups comprising either partial or complete-thickness tendon tears. Via dissection of ten injured and ten non-injured cadeveric shoulders, the study discovered a correlation between tendon tear size and an increase in pennation angle among two of the rotator cuff muscles. Pennation angle remained unaffected across all rotator cuff muscles in the partial tendon tear group, suggesting a threshold tear size must be exceeded to produce any changes in pennation angle. Full-thickness tendon tears did not affect the pennation angle of the subscapularis or teres minor muscles. However, a correlation between full-thickness rotator cuff tear size and the pennation angle of the supraspnatus and infraspinatus muscles was evident. The length of the full-thickness tendon tear strongly correlated with an increase in the pennation angle of the supraspinatus muscle. In addition, a moderately strong association between the area of the full-thickness tear and the resulting increase in pennation angle of the infraspinatus was visible. The increase in pennation angle may lead to changes in muscle structure. In a study utilizing sheep subjects, a chronic rotator cuff tear resulted in an increase in both the pennation angle and separation between myofibers of the rotator cuff muscles. Fat cells then populated the rearranged muscle. This phenomenon was also evident in the aforementioned human experiment. The increase in pennation angle following full-thickness tendon tears will result in a change to the PCSA of the supraspinatus and infraspinutus muscles. This would reduce the force producing capacity of these muscles. However, partial tendon tears, which did not result in a change to pennation in any of the rotator cuff muscles, may not impair the force producing properties of the muscles. Azizi‚Äôs observations on variable gearing in pennate muscles further suggests tendon tears will affect the AGR of the supraspinatus and infraspinutus. The greater pennation angle could result in an increased AGR. Some scientists suggest patch grafts ought to be applied to irreparable rotator cuff tears. Though this practice lessens pain, muscle strength is not fully recovered. The abovementioned human rotator cuff study correlates pennation angle with tear length in the supraspinatus muscle. Therefore, a patch graft may not resolve the length change necessary to restore pennation angle; retraction of the torn tendon may lessen the post-tear pennation angle and restore muscle strength to a greater extent. Intrafasciular strain showed that the muscle was nonuniform, and that the architectural gear ratio is the highest at the proximal region of the muscle but then decreases towards the distal region. ‚Äú It is currently not possible to determine the precise distribution of stress throughout a muscle, but it seems reasonable to assume that the total (integrated) force at any cross section of the muscle and tendon remains fairly constant along the proximodistal axis. The smaller cross-sectional areas as the muscle thins and becomes tendon will thus result in a higher stress concentration to accommodate the same stress over a smaller area and therefore potentially higher strains if material properties remained constant.\\" Muscle architecture and resistance training The muscle architecture of pennate muscles, such as the human quadriceps, is highly plastic and strongly influences contractile properties. Changes to pennate muscle architectural properties, such as pennation angle and thereby the PCSA, can alter the muscle‚Äôs force producing capabilities as well as the AGR at which the muscle operates. Parallelogram models predict that total PCSA of bipennate muscles increases in proportion to sin(Œ∏pennation) while total force exerted on the associated aponeurosis decreases with cos(Œ∏pennation). This theorizes that pennate muscle force generation increases until a 45 degree pennation angle is achieved.Aagaard P, Andersen J, Dyhre-Poulsen P, Leffers A, Wagner A, Magnusson SP, Halkjaer-Kristensen J, Simonsen E. A mechanism for increased contractile strength of human pennate muscle in response to strength training: changes in muscle architecture. J of Physiol. 2001, 534.2: 613-623. A 2001 study, conducted by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and muscle biopsy techniques to examine the relationship between muscle architecture, contractile strength and pennation angle in the human quadriceps muscle after 14 weeks of resistance training. Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in quadriceps CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to quadriceps PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA was accompanied by a 35.5% increase in the fascicle pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major quadriceps muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle‚Äôs PCSA, a measure proportional to the contractile force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following resistance training generates an increase in the muscle‚Äôs AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity. A 2007 study, conducted by Blazevich et al., reiterated and added an extra dimension to Aagaard et al.‚Äôs conclusions. Blazevich et al. examined the effect of 10-week concentric or eccentric knee extension training on architectural properties of the human quadriceps with the purpose of uncovering the mechanical stimulus involved in architecture adaptation. Both modes of exercise resulted in increased peak concentric and eccentric strength. Concentric training, however, results in higher peak concentric strength. Ultrasonography suggests vastus medialus and vastus lateris muscle fiber length increase similarly following eccentric and concentric training, with the changes occurring abruptly over the first 5 weeks of the training program. Because fiber length was independent of training type, Blazevich et al. believe distance of operation determines the optimal fiber length. This muscle property is important in determining the angle-torque relationship of a muscle. The study supported the pennation angle trends uncovered by Aagaard et al.; in addition, Blazevich et al. concluded that the vastus lateris fascicle angle changes are independent of training type and modulates strongly with volume. This suggests fiber length and pennation angle modifications occur via separate mechanical stimuli, i.e. distance of operation and muscle volume respectively. Furthermore, these angle changes occur over a relatively long time scale as the pennation angle increased until the cessation of the training program at week 10. Blazevich et al. predict the increase in pennation angle seen after eccentric or concentric training allow the pennate muscle to attach more fibers to the associated aponeurosis as well as increase PCSA and AGR. Architectural modifications to pennate muscles shift the position at which the muscle operates on the force-velocity and force-length curves to regions best suited for the muscle‚Äôs function. An increase in pennation angle theoretically increases both the PCSA and AGR of a given pennate muscle, allowing the muscle to generate higher forces while operating at higher optimal speeds. An increase to fiber length would allow the muscle to function at longer lengths. Strain and AGR heterogeneity within a muscle A 2009 study utilizing magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography discovered strain and pennation angle heterogeneity within the medial gastrocnemius pennate muscle during differing modes of contraction. Parameters of fascicle location and contraction type (eccentric or passive), determined the magnitude of strain experienced by differing regions of the MG. Fascicle ends nearest the deep MG aponeurosis (Achilles tendon) showed an increase in strain from the proximal to distal portions of the MG muscle. The converse was seen in the fascicle ends adjacent to the superficial aponeurosis, which decreased in fiber strain from proximal to distal portions of the MG muscle. These trends may have been due to changes in CSA of the muscle at the proximal and distal ends of the MG, resulting in regions of high stress and strain concentration. This regional variability in strain was accompanied by a statistically significant increase in AGR and resting pennation angle from distal to proximal portions of the muscle. Furthermore, greater changes in pennation angle were visible at the proximal end of the MG. The experimental AGR values modulated positively with the pennation angle as well as the distance between the deep and superficial apopneuroses and may have been affected by regional patterns in orthogonal bulging. These trends highlight the complexity of muscle physiology, as different regions of muscles may contract with diverse contractile properties, such as strain and AGR.

She served as the 61st mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina, the state capital. She was elected to lead the city in the 2011 election, and succeeded Charles Meeker, who had declined to run for re-election to another term. McFarlane is a political independent (called \\"Unaffiliated\\" in North Carolina) but ran with the endorsement of the local Democratic Party. She was re-elected for three further terms, in 2013,WRAL.com, 2015, and 2017, abc11.com but declined to run for re-election in 2019. Before her election as mayor, McFarlane was a pharmacist and small business owner, served on the Raleigh City Council. She was elected in 2007 and re-elected without opposition in 2009. She left her seat on the council when she was elected mayor.  Early life and education  Nancy Pletcher McFarlane was born in Washington, D.C., on July 20, 1956 to Jean Pletcher and the late Ralph Pletcher. Joined by her brothers, the family lived in Arlington, Virginia, where McFarlane formed an early impression that the congestion there was a detriment to living quality. \\"I know what large, poorly planned growth can do to an area,\\" she said during her 2011 run for mayor. McFarlane earned a Bachelor of Science in pharmacy from Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Pharmacy at the Medical College of Virginia. While there, she met Ron McFarlane, who was pursuing a degree in pharmacy as well. She married him in 1980. In 2010 the McFarlanes received the Distinguished Pharmacy Alumni Award from Virginia Commonwealth University for the contributions they have made to the profession of pharmacy. Career After graduating from Virginia Commonwealth University, McFarlane worked as a hospital pharmacist in Richmond, Virginia until she and her husband moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1984. She later worked briefly as a retail pharmacist and then spent 15 years at Raleigh Community Hospital (now known as Duke Raleigh North) as a hospital pharmacist while raising her three children.  MedPro Rx  In 2002, after 22 years as a retail and hospital pharmacist, McFarlane launched MedPro Rx, Inc., an accredited specialty infusion pharmacy that provides infusion medications and services to clients with chronic illnesses. \\"I wanted to provide more than medicine,\\" she said. \\"I wanted to offer the support and services that are often lost in bigger companies.\\" She has built the company into one of Inc. Magazine's fastest- growing companies from 2009‚Äì2011. In 2013, McFarlane was named one of the top entrepreneurs in the Triangle region by Business Leader Magazine.  City council service  ABC 11 news television crew in 2012 McFarlane won the District A City Council seat in 2007, and ran without opposition in 2009. She served on the Budget and Economic Development Committee and was chair of the Comprehensive Planning Committee. McFarlane worked with the Coalition to Unchain Dogs which works to mitigate the negative consequences of keeping dogs chained and she initiated the tasking of the City Attorney to draw up the Dog Tethering Ordinance which was unanimously passed by the City Council on March 3, 2009 and took effect July 1 of that year.  Mayoral service  When her predecessor in the office, Charles Meeker, decided to not seek re-election as mayor in 2011, he suggested to both McFarlane and fellow city councilor (and eventual successor) Mary-Ann Baldwin that one of the two should run in his place. She had been approached earlier with a similar suggestion, but considering herself largely apolitical, turned down the offer at that time. Baldwin was, at the time, dealing with personal issues and declined to run, so McFarlane accepted the offer, and decided to run for mayor that year. Running as an unaffiliated candidate, she won 61% of the vote over the next candidate, a Republican. Being new to politics, she frequently sought advice both from her predecessor Meeker and former Raleigh mayor Thomas Bradshaw, as well as then New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. She developed a leadership style described as \\"dull\\", with her council meetings almost always featuring unanimous votes. This was due to her efforts holding discussions with council members outside of meetings to handle negotiations out of the public eye, and keep meetings efficient. She presided over Raleigh during a period of unprecedented growth, as the formerly moribund downtown area was rebuilt, and as the population growth was among the highest in the United States. Her biggest achievement during her time as mayor, and the one fraught with the most controversy, was the acquisition of the 325-acre campus of the former Dorothea Dix Hospital, which had been sought by the city for some time as a potential large public park. At a time when North Carolina state party politics was shifting from Democratic to Republican control of the legislature and major state offices, McFarlane finalized a deal during the last months of outgoing governor Bev Perdue's term for the state of North Carolina (which owned the Dix property) to lease the land to the city of Raleigh. The new governor, Pat McCrory, backed by the legislature, made several attempts early in his term to halt or reverse the deal, but she developed a close working relationship with McCrory, himself a former mayor of a large North Carolina city (Charlotte) and in 2015, he reversed his former position and the lease was signed, allowing the city to build its park on the land. McFarlane remained popular and was easily re-elected in 2013 and 2015, with her only serious opposition coming from Charles Francis during the 2017 campaign. Following the 2017 election, her formerly smooth working relationship with the council was upended when internal political divisions led to several factions developing within the council, and unlike her prior terms, where there was little public debate, council meetings became acrimonious affairs where several council members attempted to form a \\"working majority\\" to steer the council in their own political direction and away from McFarlane's. Following surgery to correct debilitating back pain, on March 13, 2019, McFarlane announced that she would not be seeking re-election to a fifth term as mayor. She was replaced in the 2019 election as mayor by her long-time political ally Mary-Ann Baldwin, and many of the council members who stood against her during her last term as mayor lost their seats on the city council, with the Baldwin administration re-enacting many of McFarlane's prior policies and programs.

It is a wooden structure in the Shingle Style built around 1890. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with other properties in the city. It incorporates an unusual carriage house into its overall design, the only house in Aspen to do so. In 1922 William Shaw, an attorney who had specialized in water law, moved in, following his ascension to the city's judgeship the previous year. He remained in the house until 1969, during which time Aspen went from a depressed former mining town to a bustling, glamorous ski resort, a process he played a small role in. After his tenure, the house passed to other owners, eventually becoming one of several Aspen properties owned by Jack Nicholson, one of the celebrities who had early on been drawn to Aspen as a retreat, until he sold it in 2013. It has remained intact with few alterations. Building The house occupies a lot on the north side of Lake Avenue, the northernmost street in Aspen's predominantly residential West End, at the oblique three-way intersection Lake makes with North First and West Smuggler streets. The terrain is generally level, sloping slightly towards the Roaring Fork River to the north. To the south and west are houses generally of a similar scale, or larger, and more modern construction. On the north and east is a small lake and woodlands, and north of them the river. Tall mature trees shade many of the houses. The house itself is a two-and-a-half-story wood frame structure on a brick foundation. It is sided in clapboard on the first story, shingles on the second and fishscale shingles in the attic gable field. At the top is a complex gabled roof pierced by a brick chimney. A low iron fence and gate separates the house from the street. On the three-bay south (front) facade, the western two bays are on a small projecting section. A veranda begins here and wraps around the house's west side. It has a wooden rail with regular turned posts supporting the slightly flared upper story. Behind it are a double-hung one-over-one sash window and plain wooden door. The upper story has a double one-over-one sash. A wide overhanging eave at the roofline sets off its projecting nested gable, decorated with half-timbers.See photo. To the east the single rectangular bay is also on a projecting section. It has a rectangular picture window with decorative muntins along the sides. Above a molded cornice continues from the porch roofline to the east side of the projection. A similar, plainer cornice marks the bottom of the flaring on the second story, where the projection narrows to not much wider than the single one-over-one double-hung sash on that floor. Three smaller one-over- ones are in the main gable apex. On the west side there is a single-pane window under a pent roof next to the porch. Above it is a section with a hip roof and four casement windows. At the rear the carriage house, with four sliding doors, projects from the house. History Aspen went from a rough settlement of tents and log cabins in the late 1870s to a bustling silver mining boomtown of around 10,000 by 1890, when the house is believed to have been built. While the city's entire street grid pattern had been plotted out early, most development was concentrated in the city's eastern section, where its commercial and civic center was and is. Residents who had made their fortune from mining or related businesses chose to build their houses in the undeveloped West End.Norgren, 3. The area where the house was built was known as Hallam's Subdivision, after an early developer of the town who bought it in the early 1880s with the intention of building a park with walks, drives and pavilions. The lake was to be stocked with trout. Other than the pavilions, none of this ever came to pass and houses were built on the tract instead. From the use of the Shingle Style, it is likely that the Newberry House was built in the early 1890s, when that became popular. The attached carriage house is a unique feature in the city. Prosperity came to an abrupt end with the Panic of 1893. In response to the crisis, Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which had required the federal government to buy silver to support the dollar, to ease fears of inflation. Aspen had been unaffected by the crisis itself, but with the silver market limited to private purchasers, most of its mines became unprofitable. Residents began leaving for more promising opportunities elsewhere, such as Cripple Creek, Colorado. The city's population steadily declined, beginning a period of several decades known as \\"the quiet years\\".Norgren, 20. Many of the buildings from Aspen's glory years went vacant and neglected. Some succumbed to either fire or the harsh effects of long and severe mountain winters at almost above sea level. The Newberry House endured, and in 1922 it was purchased by William Shaw, a local water-law attorney who had become a Pitkin County judge the year before. There is no record of the seller, Mrs. Alex Tompkins, other than this transaction. In the years before World War II, when the city's population had declined to a few hundred year-round residents, some downhill skiing enthusiasts who chanced on Aspen noticed that the mountains around the city had slopes that would make an ideal place for their hobby, then beginning to establish itself as a recreational activity. Before the war, some had cut trails and built a primitive ski lift from leftover mining equipment. This was put on hold when the United States became involved in World War II in 1941, but Aspen continued to attract interest as a winter-sports destination when members of the Tenth Mountain Division, the Army's \\"soldiers on skis\\", who trained at nearby Camp Hale, visited the city when on leave. After the war, many of the Tenth's veterans became involved in the development of skiing, and some returned to Aspen to do so.Lund and Hayes, 17. At the same time, Walter Paepcke, chairman of the Container Corporation of America, on vacation elsewhere in Colorado, visited Aspen at the behest of his wife Elizabeth. She had gone there with some friends to sample the skiing, and found it an ideal place for the classical-music festival the couple were looking to start as an American counterpart to the Salzburg Festival in Austria. The mountain location was comparable, and the remaining Victorian houses and commercial buildings added a great deal of charm, although many would need to be restored.Smith, Stacey; , Aspen Historical Society, December 1998, retrieved December 7, 2011; p. 99‚Äì100. Page numbers in this and subsequent citations refer to those used by the reading software and not those in the actual document. In order to discreetly acquire those properties, many of which had been foreclosed and were available for the small sum of unpaid property taxes, Paepcke retained Shaw as his local attorney. As a county judge, Shaw was able to smooth over the transfer of some properties which lacked clear title. Eventually the Paepckes acquired many of Aspen's landmarks, such as the Hotel Jerome and Wheeler Opera House, as well as many of the houses in the West End, and hired Bauhaus architect Herbert Bayer to refurbish them. Paepcke invested heavily in the new Aspen Skiing Company, and was eventually able to start the first Aspen Music Festival in 1949. With the founding of the Aspen Institute, the city became an attraction for corporate executives and intellectuals. Movie stars began to find Aspen a pleasant place to stay as well, and Shaw would officiate at the 1965 wedding of Kim Novak and Richard Johnson in a mountain meadow at the ski resort. After Shaw died in 1969, the house eventually became the property of another Hollywood celebrity drawn to Aspen. Jack Nicholson and his friend, record producer Lou Adler, had bought homes in the city after learning to ski in Gstaad. Neither one, it turned out, was located in an area with good television reception. After finding out that the Judge Shaw house did get a good signal, they split the purchase price in order to have a place in Aspen where they could watch Los Angeles Lakers basketball games together. They sold the house in 2013 to a Beverly Hills-based limited liability corporation. The house is largely the same as it was in a 1919 photo. A 1981 renovation added screens to the porches. Some of the exterior windows may not be original, either.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. This episode revolves around David's (Josh Dallas) increasing attraction to Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), the back story behind Prince Charming's (Dallas) past, and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) getting caught lying. It was co-written by Ian B. Goldberg and Andrew Chambliss, while being directed by Victor Nelli. The episode first aired in the United States on ABC on December 4, 2011. Plot Opening sequence A dragon breathing fire is shown in the forest. In Storybrooke In Storybrooke, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) brings David (Josh Dallas) home for a party in an attempt to bring back his memory. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) tells Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) that his amnesia is keeping the curse out, which is why the fake memories have not set in. Later that evening, David tells Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) he did not choose Kathryn, and tells Mary Margaret that he loves her instead. That night, Emma tells Mary to do what she feels is right and let David \\"figure out his life.\\" Later at the caf√©, Regina (Lana Parrilla) tells Mary Margaret to stay away from David, who has left Kathryn. Hours later at the school, David shows up to see Mary Margaret, but before she can tell him to leave, David tells her that he has made up his mind and to meet him at the toll bridge where she found him the night he awoke. While en route later that evening, David becomes lost and is given false directions from Regina, leading him to Mr. Gold's (Robert Carlyle) Pawn Shop. David becomes fixated on a small windmill that he claims once belonged to him and regains his memories. Moments later at the toll bridge, David tells Mary Margaret that he remembers his life with Kathryn and wants to try again with his wife. A heartbroken Mary Margaret leaves and takes solace at the caf√©, where Dr. Whale (David Anders) joins her and offers a drink. David, on the other hand, returns home to work things out with Kathryn. Between these events, Emma agrees to cover the night shift at the Sheriff's department so Sheriff Graham can volunteer at the animal shelter. While on patrol, Emma sees a person climbing out of the Mayor's home. As she stops to capture the individual, she is shocked to see that it is none other than Sheriff Graham himself and realizes he is having an affair with Regina. Disgusted, Emma storms off and tells the Sheriff he can finish her shift. In the characters' past Meanwhile, in the Enchanted Forest, Prince James (Dallas) competes in a battle against a challenger, preparing for his acceptance from King Midas (Alex Zahara) to slay a dragon as part of a deal between him and James' father, King George (Alan Dale). However, after celebrating the deal, James is stabbed to death by the nearly dead challenger. This makes King George worried about his future and his kingdom, until Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle) shows up to pay him a visit. Rumpelstiltskin tells him that James has a twin brother, as it appears that the king adopted James through Rumpelstiltskin in order to save the kingdom. He then tells the King that he can bring the twin to the castle to have him pose as James. At a nearby valley, a young goat herder (despite the episode's title), James' twin brother, is tending his flock. As his mother (Gabrielle Rose) arrives home from the market, she mentions the prospect of an arranged marriage, but the shepherd is not prepared to marry for the sake of a dowry, even though the farm is in trouble. Rumpelstiltskin appears and tells the shepherd the truth about his twin brother being traded to save the farm, and George's offer. The shepherd reluctantly accepts, even as he forgives his mother. While on their mission, the dragon kills the leading guards, prompting the shepherd to jump into action and trap and kill the dragon with the use of the wit he gained by tending the goats. After returning the dragon's head to King Midas, King George and the shepherd, who now takes his late brother James' name, receive a more surprising offer that will unite the two kingdoms: the hand of Midas's daughter Abigail (Griffith) in marriage. But just as the shepherd is about to turn down the offer, King George pulls him aside and whispers in his ear that he is to accept the deal or he will kill him and his mother and take away their land. The shepherd has no choice but to go along with the deal. As the shepherd returns to his home, he tells his mother that he will not be staying and he can never see her again, in order to maintain his cover as James. However, she gives him a ring that she hopes will be worn by the one that he'll fall in love with. The shepherd returns to the kingdom to thank King George and King Midas, then takes his new bride-to-be Abigail to their destined location, where along the way they're about to encounter a road block that was put in place by a hooded vagabond named Snow White (Goodwin) (This alludes to the fact that King George just said \\"You are on your way to true love\\"). Production Prince Charming (Josh Dallas, pictured) was the focus of this episode. The episode was co-written by co-producers Andrew Chambliss and Ian B. Goldberg, while being directed by Ugly Betty veteran Victor Nelli. Co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz wanted to make the series' version of Prince Charming different from traditional interpretations, and decided to mirror the story of The Prince and the Pauper. \\"What if he was a regular person like us?,\\" Kitsis recalled. As a result, Joshua Dallas tried to bring a \\"rural\\" feel to the character and make him accessible to viewers. In August 2011, TVLine reported that Lost actor Alan Dale would be playing the father of Prince Charming for one episode, with the potential for him to return for more. Series co-creator Adam Horowitz called it \\"a really pivotal role, and a pivotal part of the Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming story that we don‚Äôt think has been told yet.\\" In addition to Dale, the episode featured guest actors David Anders as Dr. Whale, Anastasia Griffith as Abigail/Kathryn Nolan, Gabrielle Rose as Ruth, and Alex Zahara as King Midas. \\"The Shepherd\\" was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale ‚Äì a novelization of the first season ‚Äì which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Cultural references In addition to being inspired by The Prince and the Pauper, another series of allusions were referenced in this episode. Both the clock moving from 8:23 to 8:42 and a bottle of McCutcheon Scotch are references to the television series Lost. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club and Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity also observed two other similarities: that Dale was placing an evil father, and the repeated use of the word \\"shepherd\\". Reception Ratings \\"The Shepherd\\" first aired on December 4, 2011, when it was watched by an estimated 9.66 million viewers and earned a 5.6/8 ratings share for overall viewers. Among adults aged 18 to 49, the episode had a ratings share of 3.2/7, a decrease of 9 percent from the previous episode. It ranked third in its timeslot, being beaten by Football Night In America on NBC and The Amazing Race on CBS but ahead of The Simpsons on the Fox network. In Canada, the episode finished in fifteenth place for the week, garnering an estimated 1.55 million viewers, an increase from the 1.43 million viewers of the previous episode. Reviews The episode was met with positive reviews. IGN writer Eric Goldman gave it a rating of 7.5 out of 10, an indication of a \\"good\\" episode. He thought Charming's fight with the dragon was a \\"well done sequence\\" and praised Goodwin and Carlyle's performances, though at times he felt the latter actor delved into campiness. In an article from Zap2It, reviewer Andrea Reiher noted that the episode made \\"us love Josh Dallas and Ginnifer Goodwin even more, which we didn't think was possible,\\" and also praised the characterization of its female friendships. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club found similarities between the forward momentum of \\"The Shepherd\\" and the television series The Vampire Diaries, attributing this to Chambliss and his other job working as that series' story editor. Sava felt that the episode's \\"saving grace\\" was Dallas, lauding his performance and chemistry with Goodwin. However, Sava criticized the episode's special effects, especially the emphasis on green screen. Laura Prudom, writing for AOLTV, was pleased to see more of Snow and Charming's story from the episode \\"Snow Falls\\", writing that Goodwin and Dallas do \\"an outstanding job portraying the starcrossed lovers, and their longing [is] palpable.\\" Consequently, Prudom found it \\"heartbreaking to see Mary Margaret wrestling with the morality of stealing a married man from his wife,\\" especially when he gains back his memories as David. Teresa Jusino of Tor.com found Charming's backstory fascinating, writing that he \\"is a wonderful character not just because of the way he‚Äôs written, but because of Dallas‚Äô grounded performance... his best work so far.\\" Jusino also praised the writing of the female characters, opining that \\"Mary Margaret, Emma, and Regina offer very different versions of what a woman can be, and while we might individually prefer one or the other, they are all complex and realistic.\\" References External links * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 1) episodes ","title":"The Shepherd (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"33963426","text":"PanchƒÅpsaras (Sanskrit: pa√±cƒÅpsaras) is a lake mentioned in Book III (Aranya Kanda) of the ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana.

It was built in 1810 for attorney and judge James Haggin. It was considered a grand home for Kentucky during the settlement period, its grounds spanning about 400 acres at the time, and stood next to the historic Fort Harrod. Following the bloody Battle of Perryville, on October 8, 1862, Rocky Point served as an impromptu field hospital for the wounded, both Union and Confederate soldiers having been treated in its basement, and a crawlspace on the wall having been used as a temporary morgue. History Captain John Haggin (1753‚Äî1825), was one of the earliest settlers in Kentucky, with his entrance in the spring of 1775. A famous \\"Indian fighter\\", he was on numerous occasions the hero attacks against pioneer settlements. Haggin set up a cabin in the place Rocky Point Manor stands today and lived there with his wife and children. The local Shawnee indians burnt his cabin down sometime in the late 18th century or early 19th century, and the family took refuge in the nearby Fort Harrod. One of Haggin's sons, James Haggin, became a prosperous land attorney and circuit judge and, in 1809, purchased the property in which his father's cabin had once stood and had the manor house built there. The house was built in early Federal style with some residual Georgian features. The house was built with a relative lack of concern for expense and labor; due to cost, it was custom at the time to use common bond on the brickwork on the less significant fa√ßades and reserve Flemish bond for the main (front) fa√ßade ‚Äî however, in Rocky Point, Flemish bond was used on all four sides. The woodwork and mouldings in the home, attributed respectively to Matthew P. Lowery, the most famous Federal craftsman of the time, and John Rogers, the most famous foreign architect in Kentucky, are also a testament to the costliness of the house. In around 1822, a wing with similar architectural features was added to the Northern side of the house and beneath it a slave kitchen with an enormous fireplace. A mansard roof was added over the structure sometime in the 1870s. There is also evidence of a summer kitchen, separated from the house (only one brick wall and outline foundation stand today), as well as a carriage house and slave quarters (now demolished). On October, 1862, the Battle of Perryville took place in a nearby field and, after the battle, the basement of the Manor was used as a field hospital and its grounds as a triage station. Many artifacts from that time have been discovered in the crawlspaces of the house or dug up from its backyard, such as Union and Confederate belts, artillery and tableware. Ownership of Rocky Point Manor changed many times over the years. In the 1940s, the manor was partitioned into apartments, although nothing was ever repaired since, at least 1986, and water damage was rampant. The house was left abandoned and lost much of its interest as its history became largely unknown. The James Harrod Trust bought it in 2001 for $75,000, but by August 2002, was described by the Kentucky New Era as being \\"hemmed into a working-class neighborhood of Harrodsburg ‚Äî decaying and repeatedly vandalized\\" and was declared among the 12 most endangered historic places by Preservation Kentucky Inc., an advocacy group. It was bought again by a private citizen in 2008, the sister of Justin Engelhardt, which led a restoration of the property.

It was an important presence because of the arrival of Habsburg armies in the area. After the treaty of Karlowitz the entirety of Transylvania became an Austrian province. Because the border with the Ottoman Empire was set on the Mure»ô River, in the area of Arad were posted guards, especially Serbians.

The mental lexicon is a construct used in linguistics and psycholinguistics to refer to individual speakers' lexical, or word, representations. However, not all scientists agree as to the utility of the mental lexicon as a scientific construct. The mental lexicon differs from the lexicon in that it is not just a general collection of words; instead, it deals with how those words are activated, stored, processed, and retrieved by each speaker. An individual's mental lexicon changes and grows as new words are learned and is always developing, but there are several theorists that argue exactly how this occurs. Some theories about the mental lexicon include the spectrum theory, the dual-coding theory, Chomsky's nativist theory, as well as the semantic network theory. Scientists also study the areas of the brain involved in lexical representations. The following addresses some of the physiological, social, and linguistic aspects of the mental lexicon. Recent studies have also shown the possibility that the mental lexicon can shrink as an individual ages, limiting the number of words they can remember and learn. The development of a second mental lexicon (L2) in bilingual speakers has also emerged as a topic of interest, suggesting that a speaker's multiple languages are not stored together, but as separate entities that are actively chosen from in each linguistic situation. Methods of inquiry Although the mental lexicon is often called a mental \\"dictionary\\", in actuality, research suggests that it differs greatly from a dictionary. For example, the mental lexicon is not organized alphabetically like a dictionary; rather, it seems to be organized in a more complex manner, with links between phonologically and semantically related lexical items. This is suggested by evidence of phenomena such as slips of the tongue, which showed that replacing words such as anecdote for antidote. Also, while dictionaries contain a fixed number of words to be counted, and remain outdated as language is continually changing, the mental lexicon consistently updates itself with new words and word meanings, while getting rid of old, unused words. The active nature of the mental lexicon makes any dictionary comparison unhelpful. Research is continuing to identify the exact way that words are linked and accessed. A common method to analyze these connections is through a lexical decision task. Lexical decision tasks have been used for many years to access how the mental lexicon is structured. Participants in this task are required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a string of letters presented on a screen to say if the string is a non-word or a real word. Reaction times from this task indicate that certain words are more \\"active\\" in participants' minds after related words have been presented. An example of this would be to present the word \\"bread\\" to the participant and then see an decreased reaction time later to the word \\"butter\\". Since the word \\"bread\\" had activated all related words, including \\"butter\\", this decreased reaction time demonstrates that related words are stored closely in the mental lexicon. By doing lexical decision tasks, researchers have been able to analyze what words are stored with what related counterparts, and what can activate these words. Theories and perspectives Not all linguists and psychologists believe in the mental lexicon's existence and there is much controversy over the concept. One theory about the mental lexicon states that it organizes our knowledge about words \\"in some sort of dictionary.\\" Another states that the mental lexicon is \\"a collection of highly complex neural circuits\\". The latter, semantic network theory, proposes the idea of spreading activation, which is a hypothetical mental process that takes place when one of the nodes in the semantic network is activated, and proposes three ways this is done: priming effects, neighborhood effects, and frequency effects, which have all been studied in depth over the years. *Priming is a term used in lexical decision tasks that accounts for decreased reaction times of related words. Interchangeable with the word \\"activation\\" in many cases, priming refers to the ability to have related words assist in the reaction times of others. In the example above, the word bread \\"primed\\" butter to be retrieved quicker. *Neighborhood effects refer to the activation of all similar \\"neighbors\\" of a target word. Neighbors are defined as items that are highly confusable with the target word due to overlapping features of other words. An example of this would be that the word \\"game\\" has the neighbors \\"came, dame, fame, lame, name, same, tame, gale, gape, gate, and gave,\\" giving it a neighborhood size of 11 because 11 new words can be constructed by only changing 1 letter of \\"game\\". The neighborhood effect claims that words with larger neighborhood sizes will have quicker reaction times in a lexical decision task suggesting that neighbors facilitate the activation of other neighborhood words. *Frequency effects suggest that words that are frequent in an individual's language are recognized faster than words that are infrequent. Forster and Chambers, 1973, found that high frequency words were named faster than low frequency ones, and Whaley, 1978 found that high frequency words were responded to faster than low frequency ones in a lexical decision task. In the spectrum theory, at one end \\"each phonological form is connected to one complex semantic representation\\", at the opposite end, homonyms and polysemes have their \\"own semantic representation[s]\\". The middle of the spectrum contains the theories that \\"suggest that related senses share a general or core semantic representation\\". The \\"dual coding theory (DCT)\\" contrasts multiple and common coding theories. DCT is \\"an internalized nonverbal system that directly represents the perceptual properties and affordances of nonverbal objects and events, and an internalized verbal system that deals directly with linguistic stimuli and responses\\". Similarly, we do not observe words \\"as elements in a data structure\\" that are \\"retrieved from memory, but rather as stimuli that alter mental states\\". Others work around Chomsky's theory that \\"all syntactic and semantic features are included directly in the abstract mental representation of a lexical word\\". Development  First language development  Average vocabulary size of an English-speaking child by age.One aspect of research on the development of the mental lexicon has focused on vocabulary growth. Converging research suggests that at least English children learn several words a day throughout development. The figure at left illustrates the growth curve of a typical English-speaking child's vocabulary size. The words acquired in the early stages of language development tend to be nouns or nounlike, and there are some similarities in first words across children (e.g., mama, daddy, dog). Fast mapping is the idea that children may be able to gain at least partial information about the meaning of a word from how it is used in a sentence, what words it is contrasted with, as well as other factors. This allows the child to quickly hypothesize about the meaning of a word. Research suggests that, despite the fast mapping hypothesis, words are not just learned as soon as we are exposed to them, each word needs some type of activation and/or acknowledgement before it is permanently and effectively stored. For young children, the word may be accurately stored in their mental lexicon, and they can recognize when an adult produces the incorrect version of the word, but they may not be able to produce the word accurately. As a child acquires their vocabulary, two separate aspects of the mental lexicon develop named the lexeme and the lemma. The lexeme is defined as the part of the mental lexicon that stores morphological and formal information about a word, such as the different versions of spelling and pronunciation of the word. The lemma is defined as the structure within the mental lexicon that stores semantic and syntactic information about a word, such as part of speech and the meaning of the word. Research has shown that the lemma develops first when a word is acquired into a child's vocabulary, and then with repeated exposure the lexeme develops. Levelt 1989).  Bilingual development  The development of the mental lexicon in bilingual children has increased in research over recent years, and has shown many complexities including the notion that bilingual speakers contain additional and separate mental lexicons for their other languages. Selecting between two or more different lexicons has shown to have benefits extending past language processes. Bilinguals significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts on executive control tasks. Researchers suggest that this enhanced cognitive ability comes from continually choosing between L1 and L2 mental lexicons. Bilinguals have also shown resilience against the onset of Alzheimer's disease, monolinguals being an average of 71.4 years old and the bilinguals 75.5 years old when symptoms of dementia were detected, a difference of 4.1 years. Brain Studies have shown that the temporal and parietal lobes in the left hemisphere are particularly relevant for the processing of lexical items. http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/5/497.short The following are some hypotheses pertaining to semantic comprehension in the brain: # Organized Unitary Content Hypothesis (OUCH): this hypothesis posits that lexical items that co-occur with high frequency are stored in the same area in the brain. # Domain-Specific Hypothesis: this hypothesis uses the theory of evolution to posit that certain categories that have an evolutionary advantage over others (such as useful items like tools) have their specialized and functionally dissociated neural circuits in the brain. # Sensory/Functional Hypothesis: this hypothesis posits that the ability to identify (i.e. be able to recognize and name) living things depends on visual information, while the ability to identify non-living things depends on functional information. Thus this hypothesis implies that modality-specific subsystems compose an overarching semantic network of lexical items. Impaired access  Anomic aphasia, aphasia (expressive + receptive aphasia) and Alzheimer's disease can all affect recalling or retrieving words. Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people, a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words. Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe form of the \\"tip-of-the-tongue\\" phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word. Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia. Expressive and receptive aphasia are neurological language disorders. Expressive aphasia limits the ability to convey thoughts through the use of speech, language or writing. Receptive aphasia affects a person's ability to comprehend spoken words, causing disordered sentences that have little or no meaning and which can include addition of nonce words. Harry Whitaker states that Alzheimer's disease patients are forgetful of proper names. Patients have difficulty generating names, especially with phonological tasks such as words starting with a certain letter. They also have word-retrieval difficulties in spontaneous speech but still have relatively preserved naming of presented stimuli. Later, loss of naming of low-frequency lexical items occurs. Eventually, the loss of ability to comprehend and name the same lexical item indicates semantic loss of the lexical item.  Shrinking  The majority of current research focuses on the acquisition and functioning of the mental lexicon, without much focus on what happens to the mental lexicon over time. Current studies suggest that as individuals age, they become less capable of storing and remembering words indicating that their \\"mental dictionary\\" is, in fact, shrinking. One study showed that the size of a Japanese woman's healthy mental lexicon of kanji shrank at a rate of approximately 1% per year between ages 83 and 93 on average. This was tested through a simple naming task once when the subject was 83, and then again at the age of 93. Other considerations Storage of acronyms As research on the mental lexicon continues to expand into our modern world of abbreviations, researchers have begun to question whether the mental lexicon has the capacity to store acronyms as well as words. Using a lexical decision task with acronyms as priming words, researchers saw that acronyms could in fact prime other related information. This finding suggests that acronyms are stored alongside their related information in the mental lexicon just as a word would be. Research also demonstrated that these acronyms would still prime related information despite inaccurate capitalization (i.e. bbc had the same priming effects as BBC).

They differ from blinders as they allowed the bird to see forward whereas blinders do not. One variety used rose-colored lenses as the coloring was thought to prevent a chicken wearing them from recognizing blood on other chickens which may increase the tendency for abnormal injurious behavior. They were mass-produced and sold throughout the United States as early as the beginning of the 20th century. Description and purpose Chicken eyeglasses were often made from celluloid or aluminum and typically consisted of \\"two oval panels that fit over the upper beak of the chicken. A pin is put through the nostril to-hold the oval pieces in place.\\" Different designs were produced that attached to the chicken's head in different ways. Some were held in place by a strap, some by small hooks into the nares (nostrils) and some by piercing the bone septum between the nostrils with a cotter pin. Due to the piercing of tissue, this last type of design is illegal in some countries. Some versions of the devices had lenses that were semi- or fully transparent whereas others were tinted, often red- or rose-colored. Other designs were blinders which are opaque and completely prevent forward vision. The intended purposes of chicken eyeglasses were to prevent aggressive pecking, cannibalism, and feather pecking. Chicken eyeglasses are an alternative to beak trimming, which is the removal of approximately one-third of the beak by a cold or heated blade, or an infrared beam, usually when chicks are 1-day old. This is often effective in reducing pecking injuries, but causes pain and has significant effects on chicken welfare. Red-tinted lenses Red-tinted lenses were considered to be effective in reducing internecine pecking because they disguise the color of blood. As summed up in a 1953 article in Indiana's National Road Traveler newspaper, \\"The deep rose-colored plastic lenses make it impossible for the cannibal [chicken] to see blood on the other chickens, although permitting it to see the grain on the ground.\\" Elmer Haas of the National Band & Tag Company, a major producer of rose-colored chicken eyeglasses, whose grandfather had \\"devised wire frames for chickens in 1902\\", indicated that he believed the purported blood-masking effect of the rose coloring was a myth: \\"the firm added the rose colored glasses because it indulged the chicken owners ... [c]hickens are color blind\\". (In fact, chickens, like other birds, have good color vision.) The firm had added the rose-colored feature to its glasses in 1939 under the brand name \\"Anti-Pix\\". This variety of eyeglasses was more complicated than others because the red lenses were fixed to a hinge at the top of the frame. This meant that as the hen lowered its head to feed, the lens swung out giving the hen an unobstructed view of the ground. When the hen raised her head, as she would during aggression, the lens would swing down giving the hen a red tinted perception of the environment. Rose-colored contact lenses, rather than eyeglasses, have also been proposed to reduce cannibalism in chickens. History Detail from a 1903 patent filed by Andrew Jackson Jr. A form of chicken eyeglasses was first patented in 1903 by Andrew Jackson Jr. of Munich, Tennessee, as an \\"Eye-protector for chickens\\"., Application: December 10, 1902; issued: June 16, 1903. In the U.S. they were available through the mail order company Sears-Roebuck, or through chicken feed stores for a few cents.Fun with science: 46 entertaining demonstrations, George Barr, p.132 The eyeglasses are no longer produced by the National Band & Tag Company, but are sought as collector's items. Using chicken eyeglasses was still practiced in 1973, evident by a report in Illinois' The Hawk-Eye newspaper that a farmer had 8,000 chickens fitted with the rose-colored variety. One inventor of a form of the glasses proposed legislation in Kansas to require all chickens in the state to be fitted with glasses, but his campaign was unsuccessful. In popular culture On January 16, 1955, Sam Nadler of the National Farm Equipment Company of Brooklyn appeared on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show was in the format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation) of contestants. Show officials listed Mr. Nadler's occupation for the audience as \\"sells 'eyeglasses' for chickens\\". After the panel was unsuccessful in guessing his occupation, Mr. Nadler's identity was revealed and he stated that his company sold 2‚Äì3 million pairs of chicken eyeglasses per year.

Bena Dibele is on the right bank of the Sankuru River just below the point where it is joined by the Lubefu River. In the early 20th century Bena Dibele was a military station under the command of a sous-officier of a Belgian cavalry regiment, assisted by a young civilian. There were about forty native soldiers stationed at the post, which served as a collection point for rubber brought in by the local people in payment of taxes. Supplies for posts such as Kole and Lodja on the Lukenye River to the north were landed at Bene Dibele and carried overland, a more reliable route than the fast and narrow Lukenye. There were very extensive government rubber plantations under the control of a white official about upstream from Dibele. Bena Dibele has always depended on the river for communication. During the Second Congo War (1998-2003) the town was cut off as all river traffic was halted from December 1998, and the local economy was crippled since farmers could not sell their produce. Finally in March 2002 a barge with 760 tonnes of supplies managed to reach the town. The shipment included iodised salt, clothing, fuel, soap, school supplies, medicine and other goods. It was coordinated by Caritas Congo, required permission from both the government and the Rwanda-backed RCD Goma armed opposition, and took almost three weeks to travel the from Kinshasa under United Nations escort. The community is served by Beni-Dibele Airport.

The system takes its name from Harrington railway station in Cumbria, England, the location of the first production version. Harrington Humps have slowly, from 2011, been installed on other UK railway stations. Background Platform height across the UK rail network is not standardised; at the time of the construction of the network, different railway companies settled on different platform heights. Platforms sited low (compared to the level of the train carriage floor) present entry and exit problems to mobility-impaired train users, including wheelchair users. Raising the level of a complete platform is relatively costly and in many instances beyond the means of Network Rail and local authorities. The impetus for the hump, it is claimed, was a complaint by the chairman of the Copeland Rail Users' Group about low platforms on the Cumbrian Coast Line causing users difficulty in alighting from trains, made at Allerdale Area Transport Advisory Group, a sub-committee of Cumbria County Council's Local Committee. A suggestion of a partial raising of platforms was made to parry a Network Rail assertion that remedial work would cost a \\"six-figure sum\\" per station. The Hump The Harrington Hump is a partial solution to this long-standing problem of user access to railway carriages from relatively low station platforms. The Hump is a pair of ramps and a short flat top, built from a glass-reinforced polymer, and capable of being designed to meet the width and height requirements of particular stations and to be installed in a few days. Installing a Harrington Hump is also much cheaper than raising the entire length of the platform ‚Äì on the order of 1/10th of the typical ¬£250,000 cost. The Hump was devised by Network Rail and Cumbria County Council, in conjunction with Pipex Structural Composites, and first installed at Harrington in December 2008. Harrington was chosen as the pilot site, it is claimed, because it has the greatest drop from train floor to platform, and because as a coastal station, it offered the harshest of environments in which to test the hump. Otherwise known as an \\"Easy Access Area\\", Network Rail has conceded that the structure will henceforth be known by its nickname, Harrington Hump. The Hump is positioned to meet a particular door on a train ‚Äì usually a door designed for wheelchair access. As such, the Hump is less suited to platforms served by different configurations of trains, such as Dalton railway station, served by two different train operators using different types of trains with wheelchair accommodation doors in different locations. The second Hump was installed at St Albans Abbey railway station, and the third at Aberdovey railway station. Other stations to receive Humps include Northwich, Flixton, Whaley Bridge, Eccles and Hadfield. The Hump system won a Delivery of Customer Service Award at the 2009 Civil Service Diversity and Equality Awards. In February 2019 a Hump was proposed for Marsden Station in West Yorkshire; this would alleviate the issue of a 45 cm drop from train to platformhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- leeds-47265241 Innovative aspects According to the Association of Community Rail Partnerships, innovative aspects of the Hump are that it is: *Cheap *Not requiring possession to install *Capable of local hand assembly without large power tools *Capable of being used across the network *Good design life (50 years) *Safe and providing standard height access to train *Meet Network standards or provide reason for variation *Preferably capable of installation by four persons *Capable of installation in 3 days Other UK station humps Similar humps have been installed on the London Underground, such as between 2010‚Äì2011, all of the Victoria line stations except Pimlico; in this case the humps are of a masonry construction and thus are not Harringtons. The impetus for their installation are the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.

Produced by the McCartneys' MPL Communications, it was broadcast around the world to accompany the contemporary release of a 2-disc retrospective collection from McCartney's solo career, titled Wingspan: Hits and History. An accompanying book, also titled Wingspan, based upon the documentary's script as edited by Beatles' historian Mark Lewisohn, was published in 2002. Summary Formed around an interview between Paul McCartney and his daughter Mary McCartney (who co-produced it with her then-husband Alistair Donald, its director), it uses the McCartneys' film and photographic archive to tell the story of Paul and Linda's founding of the band Wings in the aftermath of The Beatles' split and of its gradual evolution during the 1970s, through several line-ups. From an initial atmosphere of critical disdain and personal derision for both McCartneys the film charts the band's progress to its commercial peaks of international success and acclaim before it suffers its own disintegration at the beginning of the 1980s. The story takes up with the late-1960s meeting of Paul McCartney and photographer Linda Eastman against the background of the gradual disintegration of relationships in The Beatles. As the pair get married and withdraw from the situation of McCartney's public resignation from and legal action against The Beatles partnership, the story moves to his depressed retreat from public life in the aftermath of The Beatles' split, his initial solo albums and his gradual return to recording and playing live with a new band, Wings, formed by the pair with drummer Denny Seiwell and guitarists Denny Laine and Henry McCullough. The initial line-up's tentative tours and releases are detailed before the sudden departure of Seiwell and McCullough leads to Wings' first big commercial breakthrough, the 1973 album Band on the Run. The rebuilding of the band line-up, bringing in guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton, soon replaced by Joe English, proceeds against Wings' continued commercial ascent, culminating in their 1976 world tour which brings success which begins to rival that of The Beatles. This continues, even after the line-up is once again reduced to the trio of the McCartneys and Laine, who release a single, \\"Mull of Kintyre\\" / \\"Girls' School\\", in 1977, which tops the UK's best-selling singles of all time, previously headed by The Beatles' \\"She Loves You\\". Although a further five-piece line-up evolves and Wings continue to tour (with guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley), it is against McCartney's feeling that he has proved beyond doubt that there is life for him after The Beatles. The story's climax comes with McCartney's arrest and imprisonment in Japan in 1980 on drugs charges, at the start of Wings' tour there, leading to the end of the band. Commercial release on VHS and DVD Expanded versions of the film, re- entitled Wingspan - An Intimate Portrait were also released commercially on VHS and DVD in 2001, the latter featuring an additional 22 minutes of interview footage and a number of promotional videos.

Named after Queen Victoria, it was situated to the west of Statue Square on Hong Kong Island's waterfront with Victoria Harbour at the time. It was demolished in 1963 and replaced with the Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong. History In the 1880s, the colonial government of Hong Kong initiated the Praya Reclamation Scheme to expand the amount of land available in the city. However, the project soon ran into difficulties; it almost went bankrupt in 1893 when finances ran low and inclement weather from typhoons delayed the reclamation. Despite these challenges, the project was finished in 1904, costing more than $3 million. It added a total of of land and shifted Hong Kong Island's harbour front from Des Voeux Road to Connaught Road. Half of this new land was set aside constructing new buildings, with the other half utilised for thoroughfares and public spaces. Queen's Building was one of the new structures conceived under this plan and its construction began at around the same time that the reclamation scheme was being carried out. Hong Kong based architectural firm Leigh & Orange were commissioned to be the architects and in 1899, the construction was completed. It was one of two arcaded Victorian structures that flanked Statue Square (the old Hong Kong Club Building being the other). Queen's Building was viewed as one of the finest examples of Neoclassical architecture in Hong Kong, so much so that it was labelled \\"the city's most prestigious commercial building\\" when it opened. It was four storeys high and featured porticos, balconies and arches, topped off with a small cupola. It primarily housed a vast array of shipping, insurance and trading corporations from Europe, ' and the entrance of Queen's Building became a popular stop for rickshaws and sedan chairs.

The history reports the existence of a ruined city found in the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. Origin of the mystery In 1885, the Canadian Guillermo Farini (pseudonym of William Leonard Hunt) was one of the first westerners to cross the unexplored portion of the Kalahari. On his return to Europe, he published a book detailing his experiences which included descriptions of unusual rock formations which he believed to be ruins of hitherto unknown buildings. Farini subsequently presented a paper to the Royal Geographical Society (it was read in his absence ) and photographs taken on the expedition were publicly exhibited, increasing his notoriety and that of his journey. In his book Farini describes the ruins as > A half-buried ruin - a huge wreck of stones On a lone and desolate spot; A > temple - or a tomb for human bones Left by men to decay and rot. Rude > sculptured blocks from the red sand project, And shapeless uncouth stones > appear, Some great man's ashes designed to protect, Buried many a thousand > year. A relic, may be, of a glorious past, A city once grand and sublime, > Destroyed by earthquake, defaced by the blast, Swept away by the hand of > time. The legends and the search At the start of the 20th century, Farini's observation gave birth to a legend throughout South Africa. Some people claimed to have seen an abandoned boat or even a stone quarry in empty desert. Others attempted to explain the presence of this unknown civilization with comparisons to archaeological finds at Great Zimbabwe. From 1932, twenty five expeditions were launched to find the Lost City. They crisscrossed the desert area in the direction of Farini. F. R. Paver and Dr. W. M. Borcherds headed out from Upington to search the desert sands, flying over the area in reconnaissance aircraft and subsequently suggesting a number of explanations. However they failed to find any signs of construction in the area. Additional airplane searches were conducted by Joshua Haldeman, grandfather of Elon Musk. A possible solution to the mystery A. J. Clement researched the story in 1964 and advanced a new theory. Clement claimed his study of Farini's description of his route highlighted inconsistencies in Farini's story. Clement concluded that Farini went deep into Southern Africa, but he never actually went to the heart of the Kalahari where he claimed the Lost City was sited. To test this premise Clement explored what he regarded as Farini's true route and discovered a set of monumental rocks, resembling walls. Clement concluded that Farini's 'lost city' was shown to exist but as a natural formation. Clement had found a geological curiosity, dating back 180 million years to the great upheaval accompanying the birth of the Drakensberg Mountains in South Africa. The stones are composed of dolerite, a particular type of igneous rock which can erode to give the appearance of straight and regular blocks suggesting artificial construction.

The station is located on the Wallisellen to Rapperswil line just south-west of its junction with the T√∂sstalbahn from Winterthur via Wald. It is served by passenger trains of the Zurich S-Bahn.  History  The station opened in 1859, shortly after the opening of the Uster to Rapperswil portion of the Wallisellen to Rapperswil line in 1858. Although the line was originally promoted by an independent company, by the time R√ºti station opened it was owned by the Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen (VSB) railway company. The line to Wald opened in 1876, making R√ºti into a junction station. The line was independently owned but operated by the VSB. The VSB became part of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1902, at which point operation of the line to Wald was taken over by the T√∂sstalbahn (TTB) that already ran from Winterthur to Wald. Both the line to Wald and the TTB itself became part of the SBB in 1918. The Wallisellen to Rapperswil line was electrified in 1932, and the line to Wald in 1944.  Operation   Services  The station is served by Zurich S-Bahn lines S5 and S15, which run between Z√ºrich and Rapperswil. Between them, they provide four trains per hour throughout the day, with a journey time from Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof of just over 30 minutes. The station is also the terminus of line S26 from Winterthur over the T√∂sstalbahn, with a journey time of 50 minutes. The station is also served by several bus routes of the Verkehrsbetriebe Z√ºrichsee und Oberland (VZO).  Layout  The station has three through tracks, with a side platform and an island platform providing platform faces on all three tracks. The line north towards Uster is double tracked, whilst the line south towards Rapperswil is single tracked. The line to Wald is single track, and diverges from the line north just north of the station, on the other side of a viaduct across the Jona river. The principal station entrance and station buildings are on the south side of the station, as is the side platform. They are connected to the island platform, and a secondary entrance to the north of the station, by pedestrian subway.  Joweid Zahnradbahn  An interesting historical remnant to be found at R√ºti station are the remains of a rack equipped siding that formerly served the Joweid works of the Maschinenfabrik R√ºti to the north west of the station. These works predate the railway, being founded in 1842, and are located at a significantly lower level than the station. The line, known as the Joweid Zahnradbahn or Joweid rack railway, opened in 1877 with a ruling gradient of 10.2% (1 in 9.8) and a minimum radius of only . It was rebuilt with a new concrete viaduct in 1955. Several of the locomotives built to operate the line still exist, with two (one steam, one diesel) in use on the Rorschach Heiden Bergbahn.

Roosevelt \\"banning discriminatory employment practices by Federal agencies and all unions and companies engaged in war-related work.\\"Executive Order 8802: Prohibition of Discrimination in the Defense Industry (1941)\\", Our Documents, Executive Order 8802 dated June 25, 1941, General Records of the United States Government; Record Group 11; National Archives That was shortly before the United States entered World War II. The executive order also required federal vocational and training programs to be administered without discrimination. Established in the Office of Production Management, the FEPC was intended to help African Americans and other minorities obtain jobs in home front industries during World War II. In practice, especially in its later years, the Committee also tried to open up more skilled jobs in industry to minorities, who had often been restricted to lowest-level work. The FEPC appeared to have contributed to substantial economic improvements among black men during the 1940s by helping them gain entry to more skilled and higher- paying positions in defense-related industries. In January 1942 after the US entry into World War II, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9040 to establish the War Production Board, which replaced the Office of Production Management and put the FEPC under it answering to the War Manpower Commission. The new Board, concentrating on converting the domestic economy to a wartime footing, slashed the Committee's limited budget. In response to strong support for the FEPC and a threatened march on the capital, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9346 in May 1943, which gave the FEPC independent status within the Office of the President, established 12 regional offices, and widened its jurisdiction to all federal agencies, in addition to those directly involved in defense. It was put within the President's Office of Emergency Management. Analysis of the incomes of blacks who gained entree into the defense industries compared to men outside them showed that they benefited from the higher wages and generally retained their jobs in the early postwar years until 1950. History On June 25, 1941, President Roosevelt created the Committee on Fair Employment Practice, generally known as the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC) by signing Executive Order 8802, which stated that \\"there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" A. Philip Randolph, the founding president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, had lobbied with other activists for such provisions because of the wide discrimination against African Americans in employment across the country. With the buildup of defense industries for World War II, many African Americans moved to the industrial and urban centers in the North and West during the second phase of the Great Migration in search of jobs and to avoid rampant racial segregation, bigotry, and violence in the rural South. Upon arriving there, they were constantly excluded from applying in the defense industries because of racism and the fear of competition by Northern and Western whites. With all groups of Americans being asked to support the war effort, Randolph demanded changes in the employment practice of the defense industries. Together with other activists, Rudolph planned to muster tens of thousands of persons for a 1941 March on Washington to protest the continued segregation in the military and discrimination in defense industries. A week before the planned march, New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia met with him and other officials to discuss the President's intent to issue an executive order announcing a policy of non-discrimination in federal vocational and training programs. Randolph and his allies convinced him that more was needed, especially directed at the booming defense industries. President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 to prohibit discrimination among defense firms that had contracts with the government. He established the Fair Employment Practice Committee to implement the policy through education, acceptance of complaints of job discrimination, and work with industry on changing employment practices. The activists called off their march. An FEPC press conference, Beginning After the executive order was signed, Roosevelt appointed Mark Etheridge, a liberal editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal, to head the new agency. Etheridge brought \\"important political connections and public relations expertise to the job\\" but \\"emphasized interracial cooperation over equality and refused to challenge the southern system of segregation.\\" Knowing that industry was likely to be hostile, Randolph and other activists believed that the FEPC would depend on workers keeping their own records as to practices at workplaces and taking cases of discrimination to the Committee. The Committee had a limited budget of $80,000 in its first year, which was paid from the emergency funds of the Office of the President, which continued to fund it, as for some other agencies created by executive order. Etheridge needed to focus on a few activities in certain areas of the country. He held the first of the FEPC hearings in Los Angeles in October 1941. Some companies admitted they were discriminating based on race when hiring for new job positions, but Etheridge did little to change their practices. That lack of enforcement caused many union leaders, civil rights leaders, government officials, and employers to doubt whether the FEPC and the executive order could produce desired change. Second hearing During the second round of hearings on the Executive Order, held in Chicago and New York in January and February 1942 after US entry into World War II, supporters of the policy spoke. Support was high in these cities for several reasons: some positions with the FEPC were held by influential black attorneys who also worked closely with activists from the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the NAACP, and other prominent groups. Also, in both cities \\"activists [had] formed Metropolitan Fair Employment Practice Councils to help workers document discrimination and bring complaints before the FEPC and push local officials to implement Roosevelt's order.\\" These cities also had histories of strong union organizing, and some union leaders were willing to cooperate to change workplaces. Etheridge stated his opposition to discrimination in the employment practices of companies that failed to implement the EO. In this second round of hearings, Etheridge took action related to companies that had complaints filed against them. For companies in Chicago and Milwaukee, he demanded that all the companies on trial update their employment policies to conform to the EO. The companies were required to document the changes made and send updated information to employment agencies (to alert them to the hiring of minorities), in addition to providing reports about their employment status to the FEPC, for updates on minority hires. The FEPC alone did not end employment discrimination in New York or Chicago but contributed to improvements. Progress was also dependent on other parties, for instance, the government officials and local activists who worked together to enforce President Roosevelt's executive order. Employment Within a year of the Executive Order being issued, the number of African Americans and other minorities being employed by the defense industries had increased, especially in shipbuilding and aircraft plants. Automobile plants, which were rapidly converted to wartime production, showed the most significant improvement in the hiring of minorities. They already had established unions that began to encourage compliance and force cooperation of members. After a wildcat strike in Detroit in 1943 at the Packard plant, when three blacks were promoted to work next to whites, activists and officials of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) became more effective in pressuring the companies and threatening white union members with the risk of being fired for refusing to work alongside African Americans. Challenges The Fair Employment Practice Committee encountered great resistance in the South, where states had disfranchised blacks since the turn of the century and maintained legal segregation in public facilities under their Jim Crow laws. The Executive Order was strongly opposed by local employers and elected officials, as well as most white workers, and the civil rights organizations were not as influential because blacks were generally closed out of the political system, despite their significant portion of the population in many areas of the region. Black activists were effective in some areas in getting local officials to address discrimination in employment. As historian Thomas Maloney noted in a review of Andrew E. Kersten's book on the FEPC, \\"Success in promoting greater labor market equality was dependent on support from local government, federal government offices in the city, and local activist organizations.\\" The FEPC had little power and no authority to regulate employment practices. The FEPC was given a very low budget, small staff, and little means for reinforcement.Takaki, Ronald T. Double Victory: A Multicultural History of America in World War II, Boston: Little, Brown and, 2000. Historians such as Ronald Takaki believe it was a \\"show\\" kind of agency, set up for failure. It was opposed for ideological reasons by Southern Democrats and other congressmen, and by some labor officials. Some Federal officials in Washington actively frustrated the FEPC's efforts; for example, Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles advised President Roosevelt that the State Department was \\"strongly opposed\\" to the public hearings that the FEPC was planning to hold in June 1942, worrying that they might damage the US reputation abroad by publicizing social inequities or give its enemies material to undermine United States morale at home and among its fighting troops. During the first year, the FEPC had a budget of $80,000. Over time, the committee added staff, but its eventual budget of $431,609 provided average spending on positions that was below that for other agencies. Those who opposed the FEPC did so in many ways. Many efforts were taken to discredit the committee by questioning the constitutionality of its mission and accusing the FEPC of communism. Congressional attacks, including from powerful Southern Democrats, took place when the FEPC was required to testify before the House of Representatives Committee that oversaw its program. The House Rules Committee, headed by a Southern Congressman, also exerted control. In 1943 other opponents worked through the Senate to restrict agencies created by executive order; they required that after a year, the agency could have funds only if that money was appropriated to them by Congress, as was the policy for standing executive agencies set up by law. If the proposal had passed, the FEPC would likely have had even less money to carry out its program of holding hearings and taking testimony, as well as collecting and analyzing data from companies. Critics of the FEPC argue that the agency was created to appease Randolph and other activists to prevent a march on the capital. The Committee had a limited range of power and had to work largely by influence. The FEPC was limited to overseeing the defense industries and had no power in other industries where \\"numerous Negroes were employed or seeking employment.\\" Within the private sector of the Northern region of the United States, the FEPC began to make gains in enforcing non-discrimination. In the border region, its intervention led to some hate strikes by angry white workers. In the South, hate crimes and corruption among Southern government officials contributed to the FEPC's policies being relatively ineffective. In New Iberia, Louisiana, for example, the FEPC worked with the local NAACP branch to address admissions discrimination at a new local welding school, yet local law enforcement terrorized the agents and plaintiffs and violently expelled them from the town.\\"A Louisiana Town Expels All of Its Black Doctors in a Prescription for the Status Quo,\\" Southern Hollows Podcast, retrieved November 27, 2019. Overall, the FEPC was relatively ineffective in its efforts to address the issue of racial discrimination throughout World War II. Changes In August 1942, President Roosevelt and others noticed that the progress of the FEPC was slowing. The agency had earlier that year been put under control of the War Production Board via Executive Order 9040, which was established to replace the Office of Production Management after US entry into the war, when it needed to convert industry to a wartime footing. Opponents of this action believed that Roosevelt was yielding to pressure from powerful southern Democrats in Congress. FEPC Chairman MacLean objected to the transfer, saying that Roosevelt's administration was reducing the FEPC to \\"a small Federal bureau without power.\\" A. Phillip Randolph said the White House's policy was completely \\"emasculating\\" the usefulness of the committee. Roosevelt said the change was intended to support the anti-discrimination agency, but some observers believed the change hampered it. As a start, the chairman of the War Manpower Commission \\"slashed its budget, denied requests for office space, and refused to aid in conflicts with discriminatory contractors.\\" Key personnel resigned in protest.William J. Collins. \\"Race, Roosevelt, and Wartime Production: Fair Employment in World War II Labor Markets\\", American Economic Review 91:1 (March 2001), pp. 272‚Äì286. in JSTOR, accessed 21 September 2015 Randolph and other activists protested as well, threatening a march on Washington to put pressure on the administration. In May 1943, Roosevelt strengthened the FEPC by Executive Order 9346, giving it independence by placing it within the Office for Emergency Management in the Executive Office of the President. The new executive order required that all government contracts have a mandatory non-discrimination clause, authorized twelve regional offices and appropriate staff and broadened the jurisdiction of the agency to federal government agencies. During World War II the federal government was operating airfields, shipyards, supply centers, ammunition plants, and other facilities that employed millions. The FEPC operated until the end of the war overseeing defense industries and federal agencies. The FEPC expanded its jurisdiction to federal government departments and agencies as employers; they were \\"now were explicitly covered along with war industries, unions, and war-training programs.\\" Agency records show that New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, all major sites of defense industries, were the cities with the largest number of cases filed with the FEPC, about 200 in each place. With the help of the FEPC, black men outside the South made substantial economic progress in the 1940s. As suggested by William J. Collins, the FEPC helped make opportunities by the following: > *providing advice on how to integrate the workplace; *giving managers a > ready excuse for hiring blacks if whites objected; *threatening to bring > more powerful federal agencies into the fray on the side of the FEPC; and/or > *publicly embarrassing firms or unions that refused to hire blacks. To promote the establishment of a permanent FEPC in the government, A. Phillip Randolph recruited young feminists Anna Arnold Hedgeman in 1944 to work with a National Council to lobby for this goal. Because of limited funds, Hedgeman hired a staff of women and college students to help with the publicity and fundraising for the FEPC. She wanted the FEPC Councils to promote fair employment policies in both state and local governments. Her staff introduced laws to this effect in almost every state, but not many state legislatures then supported such bills. A bill for a nationwide FEPC and anti- discrimination in employment made its way to Harry S. Truman after the death of President Roosevelt in 1945, who wanted to lobby the bill. By the time the Second World War ended in August, Congress \\"provided some additional funding but ordered the FEPC to cease all operations by June 30, 1946.\\" Continuing tensions in cities that were booming with increased populations for the defense industries erupted in race riots in 1943 in Detroit, Los Angeles, Mobile, Alabama; and Beaumont, Texas. In each city, new populations were competing for jobs and housing, and expectations were rising among African Americans to share in the wartime boom. In many places, white workers were resisting this change. In the Detroit Packard plant, 25,000 white workers walked off the job in 1943 when three blacks were promoted to work next to whites in the assembly line. The FEPC worked to avoid such \\"hate\\" strikes and help employers manage integration, and to negotiate settlements in cases when strikes did take place. Legacy The Fair Employment Practice Committee did not end racial discrimination in employment practices during World War II, but it did have a lasting effect in that era. It opened some doors, as far more of its cases were based on \\"refusal to hire\\" than \\"refusal to upgrade\\" or \\"discriminatory working conditions\\". It apparently helped blacks enter \\"industries, firms, and occupations that otherwise might have remained closed to them.\\" The operation of the FEPC supported the idea that \\"economic rights can be obtained principally by activity in the economic sphere: through education, protest, self-help, and, at times, intimidation.\\" It gained the support of states and government to eliminate racial discrimination in employment practices. During its relatively short period of operations from 1941 to 1946, the FEPC encouraged the formation of other groups with similar goals, such as the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights supporting the National Council for a Permanent FEPC. By opening some good-paying jobs in the defense industry, the FEPC created an opportunity for African Americans. By 1950, compared to other men in comparable positions, those blacks who gained jobs in defense were making 14% more than their counterparts outside.Thomas Maloney, \\"Review of Andrew Edmund Kersten's Race, Jobs, and the War: The FEPC in the Midwest, 1941-46, EH.NET (April 2000), accessed 21 September 2015 The proportion of blacks in the defense industry did not decline after the war, suggesting that many men had gained an entree into important new work. In 1948, President Truman asked Congress to approve a permanent FEPC, anti- lynching legislation and the abolition of the poll tax in federal elections. A Democratic coalition prevented the legislation's passage. Still operating effectively with one-party systems in their states due to disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century, Southern Democrats had powerful positions in Congress, controlling chairmanships of important committees, and opposed these measures. In 1950, the House approved a permanent FEPC bill, but Southern senators filibustered and the bill failed. Congress has never enacted the FEPC into law. But Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Washington successfully enacted and enforced their own FEPC laws at the state level.

Since North Carolina prohibits collective bargaining by public employees, the NCAE works as a professional development and advocacy organization. It is affiliated with the National Education Association. The organization has nearly 60,000 members. History The history of the NCAE began in 1857 with the formation of the North Carolina Education Association. The North Carolina Teachers Association began in 1880. The North Carolina Teachers Association was the first African American teachers' association to affiliate with the NEA-Department of Classroom Teachers. Just like the schools systems were separated along racial lines, so were the two education associations divided. The NC Education Association represented white teachers while the NC Teachers Association represented black teachers. When integration began in the school systems, the two organizations looked to merge as well. The merger of the two groups that created the North Carolina Association of Educators was approved in 1970. Structure and governance Officers of the NCAE are elected to four-year terms. The current President is Tamika Walker Kelly. The Vice President is Bryan Proffitt. Rachelle Johnson fills the position of Executive Director.http://www.ncae.org/who-we-are/ncae-officers- and-board-of-directors/ Funding The NCAE is a 501(c)6 tax-exempt organization. After the Republicans gained control of the North Carolina General Assembly for the first time since 1870, one of the laws passed included Senate Bill 727 which takes away the ability for school employees to have automatic deductions taken out for dues payments to the North Carolina Association of Educators. The NCAE claims that the Republicans specifically targeted their group for retribution with this legislation by using a late- night override of Governor Bev Perdue's veto. In December, 2012, a Wake County Superior Court judge struck down this law stating that it violated the state constitution.

George W. Huffman, et al., ‚Äú2,2'-Isopropylidine bis(tetrahydrofuran)‚Äù, US patent 4,577,035 (1986). It may be prepared by hydrogenation of 2,2-di-2-furylpropane. Consideration of the structure of ditetrahydrofurylpropane, DTHFP suggests that this molecule may exist as various stereoisomers depending on the orientation of the two H atoms adjacent to the isopropylidene bridging unit. The meso form (absolute configuration SR or RS) is symmetrical, while the stereoisomers (of absolute configuration SS and RR) represent a racemic pair.  Synonyms  Furan, 2,2'-(1-methylethylidene)bis[tetrahydro-2,2-Bis(2-oxolanyl)propane 2,2-Bis(2-tetrahydrofuryl)propane 2,2'-Isopropylidenebis(tetrahydrofuran) Bistetrahydrofurylpropane DTHFP  Synthesis  Ditetrahydrofurylpropane was synthesized in 1986 by Huffman via hydrogenation of 2,2-di-2-furylpropane. Vacuum distilled 2,2-di-2-furylpropane may be hydrogenated in nearly quantitative yield in alcohol solvents employing palladium on carbon or rhodium on carbon catalysts. Typical reaction times are a few hours at moderate temperatures at 100-800 psig hydrogen pressure.  Applications  Ditetrahydrofurylpropane (DTHFP) has found application as a rubber additive in the manufacture of high vinyl content rubber for high performance tires. DTHFP functions as an anionic polymerization catalyst modifier allowing the preparation of rubber of high vinyl content. Since the meso and racemic forms of DTHFP are diastereomeric, they have different physical properties and, in principle, can be separated by physical methods. In fact, the diastereomeric forms of DTHFP have been separated by column chromatography over silica gel.Terence E. Hogan, et al., ‚ÄúImproved Vinyl Modifier Compositions and processes for Utilizing such Compositions‚Äù, WIPO Patent Application WO/2011/087841 (2011). The symmetrical, meso form of DTHFP was found to be significantly more effective in increasing the vinyl content of rubber than the racemic form.

The act proposed federal legislation that would provide conditional resident status to undocumented immigrant students of good moral character. Inspiration for the name \\"Trail of Dreams\\" came from the Trail of Tears. Background The Trail of Dreams walk began on January 1, 2010 in Miami, Florida. Four Miami-Dade County college students- Felipe Matos, Gaby Pacheco, Carlos Roa, and Juan Rodriguez- walked the 1,500 miles to the United States capitol in Washington, D.C. The main purposes of the Trail of Dreams walk were to promote human rights, stop the deportations of current undocumented students and to support the DREAM Act. Three of the four students were brought to the United States illegally when they were children. They called for immigration reform and legislation that will allow eligible undocumented immigrants to obtain citizenship in the United States. The Trail of Dreams chose Washington, D.C. as their endpoint in order to request a meeting with President Barack Obama. One of the walkers, Juan Rodriquez, outlined the Trail of Dreams with respect the rights of workers, fulfilling equal accessibility to education, having a just and humane pathway to full citizenship, and protecting the sacred bonds and unity of our families. The press referred to the four student walkers as \\"DREAMers\\" or \\"Dream Walkers\\". Activity The Trail began in Miami, Florida at the Miami Freedom Tower. It continued through a variety of small towns in city in Florida. The DREAMers took time to drive out to St. Augustine, Florida to celebrate Martin Luther King Day. They traveled through Georgia and made a stop in Atlanta where they spoke with local politicians and the mayor. The Trail of Dreams traveled through South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and into Washington D.C. The four DREAMers arrived in D.C. on Wednesday, April 28, 2010. At 9:15 a.m. a press conference was held between East and West Executive Avenues near the White House. They were joined by immigration reform allies from the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Students Working for Equal Rights, Presente.org and others. The Trail of Dreams then completed their journey with a walk to the National Press Club. This walk included many immigrant students and allies. The original goal to meet with President Barack Obama was not met by the end of the walk. Methods The Trail of Dreams adhered to model of nonviolence as modeled by Martin Luther King Jr. and used a variety of methods to educate and promote their goals. These included organizing press conferences, fasting, peaceful civil disobedience actions throughout the country, calling and emailing members of congress, lobbying for immigration reform, and signed petitions (with over 30,000 signatures gathered throughout the 1,500-mile journey). Support The Trail of Dreams found support from communities in every area they passed through on their 1,500-mile journey. Supporters provided food, shelter, encouragement and money. Many supporters participated in the walk with the four DREAMers. In Jupiter, Florida, around 70 people, many of them day laborers from Guatemala, joined the walk through their town. The Lake Worth, Florida City Commissioner, Cara Jennings, declared January 6 as Dreamer's Day in honor of the four students visit to the area. In Atlanta, Georgia the DREAMers were assisted by joined by over 200 people and the Georgia Tech marching band on the last 1.5 miles of their walk that particular day. They were also assisted by the local First Iconium Baptist Church which held a meeting that over 300 supporters attended. The Trail of Dreams inspired five immigrant students from New York to embark on their own walk. The New York Trail of Dreams was a 250-mile journey that began on April 10, 2010. Five students walked through communities to raise awareness for the struggles of undocumented students and to promote the immediate passing of the DREAM Act. The Trail of Dreams walk was supported by several key organizations. They were a part of the Students Working for Equal Rights and the Florida Immigrant Coalition. Both organizations help fight for immigration rights in community integration, higher education and basic human rights. The Trail of Dreams was also aided a great deal by the internet and social media. DreamActivist.org and Presente.org both utilized the internet to help foster a community support of multi-ethnic, immigrant youth. Twitter and Facebook were used to document the journey and to upload videos that helped connect outsiders to the journey for immigration reform. Opposition On February 20, 2010 the DREAMers drove to Nahunta, Georgia where they encountered a Ku Klux Klan organizing an anti- immigrant demonstration. The NAACP organized an opposition rally to the demonstration and the Trail of Dream walkers joined them in protesting. DREAMer Juan Rodriguez blogged about the experience: \\"Ultimately, the success of today was to be able to stand hand in hand with our friends from the NAACP; singing liberation songs together and acknowledging our united struggle for racial justice. We ALL deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\\" On March 3, 2010 the DREAMers walked through Gwinnett County in Georgia. Gwinnett County is home to Sheriff \\"Butch\\" Conway, a supporter of the Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g). \\"287(g)\\" is a federal prevision authorizing local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws. Sheriff Conway has voiced that the accusations of racial profiling in order to uphold \\"287(g)\\" are false but acknowledges that the Gwinnett County Sheriff's office has the authority to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE)on identifying illegal immigrants if brought into the county jail. The DREAMers believed that the federal provision led to the deportation of hundreds of immigrants in Gwinnett County over the course of three months. In response, the Trail of Dreams held a press conference outside of the Sheriff's office and requested a meeting with Sheriff Conway in order to denounce his involvement with \\"287(g)\\". The DREAMers were not granted access to a personal meeting with Sheriff Conway. Results The Trail of Dreams walk ended in Washington D.C. on May 1 but the four DREAMers continue to fight for the DREAM Act and for immigration reform. On May 24, 2010 the four students flew to Arizona to participate in an immigration march. On June 1 they attended a meeting with Joe Arpaio, Maricopa County's Sheriff. Sheriff Arpaio is well known for his strict adherence to immigration laws. The meeting was risky for the undocumented illegal immigrants in the Trail of Dreams group. Earlier in the morning Sheriff Arpaio submitted a tweet that read, \\"Just heard that some students from Fla. are coming to visit me and are self admitted illegal aliens\\". The meeting was peaceful and no legal action was taken against the undocumented students. On Monday, June 28, 2010 the only documented immigrant, Juan Rodriguez, was granted a meeting with President Barack Obama to discuss immigration reform. Rodriguez joined a group of immigrant reform activists during his meeting with the President. According to Rodriguez, the President was both receptive and critical of the ideas and concerns brought forth. The Trail of Dreams garnered support from thousands of people and inspired many immigrant students to continue the pursuit of immigration reform. On Monday, September 20 a group of college students gathered at the Arizona state capitol building to persuade Senator John McCain to support the DREAM Act. In late November former and current undocumented immigration students fasted outside of Senator John McCain's Arizona office to again encourage him to support the passing of the DREAM Act.

Gives list of Corbetts in height order. and the 277th highest Marilyn.The Relative Hills Of Britain. Gives list of Marilyns in height order. It is a long elongated mountain with a NW-SE orientation, its summit ridge is impressive, barely dropping below the contour in its length. Its SW slopes drops away steeply and rockily towards Loch a‚Äô Ghobhainn while its NE slopes are less precipitous, throwing out a series of spurs which produces three craggy corries. Strong hill walkers can climb Baosbheinn with the adjacent Corbett of Beinn an Eoin which stands across Loch na h-Oidhche and gives a demanding circular walk of which takes between six and nine hours.Munro Magic. Gives some details for overview. Etymology The translation of Baosbheinn from the Scottish Gaelic language is usually given by guidebooks as ‚ÄúWizard‚Äôs hill‚Äù this comes from the word baobh but strictly speaking this translates as a hag or bitch. Buidsear or fiosaiche is the usual word for a wizard. Scholars have put forward alternatives, one of these is beidhis-fjall from the Old Norse language which translates as hunting hill, with the Norse fjall later changed to the Gaelic bheinn . Local residents of Wester Ross refer to the hill as ‚Äúmountain of the face‚Äù, this is explained by the fact that when viewed from Gairloch in the morning light, the hill resembles the appearance of a human head. This is supported by older spellings of the name which use derivations of bathais which translates as face or forehead. Lexilogos Scottish Gaelic Dictionary. Gives Gaelic translations. In conclusion, although the translated name is usually given as Wizard's Hill, the alternatives of Hill of the Face, Hunting Hill or Hill of the Hag (or Wicked Person) may have stronger supporting evidence.\\"The Call Of The Corbetts\\", Irvine Butterfield, , page 36, Gives etymology details. Geography and geology Baosbheinn summit ridge is made up of five prominent high points, starting at the SE end of the ridge is the outlying shoulder of Ceann Beag () after a short descent to a col at c. the ridge rises steeply over an unnamed top of c. before continuing to the main summit (875 metres), named Sgorr Dubh on OS maps. The ridge continues for two km to reach the NW top () before descending to Creag an Fithich () at the northern end of the ridge. Baosbheinn has three north facing corries, An R√®idh-choire is the largest and lives up to its name of Smooth corrie, being quite open and grassy while the smaller Coire Beag and Coire Mor are more compact and are lined by crags. Baosbheinn has one noteworthy geological feature: it being the site of the largest and most impressive protalus ramparthttp://www.landforms.eu/cairngorms/protalus%20rampart.htm protalus rampart in Great Britain. The rampart is situated at the NW end of the ridge below the crags of Creag an Fithich at a height of around . It formed in post- glacial times when a massive rockslide or series of rockslides involving failure of approximately 200,000 m¬≥ of rock over-rode a former snowbed and accumulated as a boulder ridge.Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Gives details of protalus rampart. The north west end of Baosbheinn where the protalus rampart is situated has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest over an area of 39,000,000 m¬≤. Ascents The usual ascent of Baosbheinn starts at a parking place at the Red Barn on the A832 road (). Most walking guidebooks recommend climbing Baosbheinn along with Beinn an Eoin, this calls for the ascent of Beinn an Eoin first, however a direct ascent of Baosbheinn is possible although the crossing of the river, the Abhainn a‚Äô Gharbh Choire can be difficult in spate conditions. The walk goes SE on the track which leads to Loch na h-Oidhche, the early part of the track goes through a recently sown plantation just to the East of Loch Bad na Sgalag where over 1 million trees of native species have been planted. The original trees in this area were cut down in the 16th and 17th centuries to feed the ironworks on the shore of Loch Maree.Nar Fir Chlis. Gives details of native pinewood. The track is left after and the ridge of Baosbheinn can be attained by crossing pathless moorland.\\"The Corbetts And Other Scottish Hills\\", Scottish Mountaineering Club, , page 184, Gives ascent route details.

Wood found two small houses which he used to study the concept of household. A small area of each of the houses was excavated and neither one was totally excavated. The larger of the two was estimated to be 7m long by 5m wide. Central hearths were found in the houses, along with charred wood and fire cracked rocks. Because of the size of the site, it is unknown what percentage of it got excavated. The Cane Island site is from the later part of the early Woodland Period and based on Wood‚Äôs work, it was determined that there had been discontinuous occupation of the site for more than 9000 years.

She was built in Scotland by Alex Stephens and completed by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Govan. Commissioned for Fleet service in 1919, she was the first Royal Navy ship to carry this name. After the war new destroyer designs were introduced, and many S-class destroyers were scrapped. By the late 1930s Sabre had been de-militarised for use as a target ship. With the outbreak of World War II, she was returned to service in 1939 despite her age and unsuitability for deployment in the Atlantic Ocean. Ship Modifications In late 1940, Sabre was modified as a convoy escort. Equipped with 14-charge pattern depth-charge arrangements, both the after 4-inch guns and the torpedo tubes were landed, one 12-pounder (AA) and 8-.5\\" (AA) (2x4) were added. Radar type 286, and later 291, was added. Later in the war four single 20 mm (AA) mountings eventually supplanted the .5\\" AA mountings.  World War II  At the outbreak of war Sabre (Lt Cdr B Dean) was part of the Home Fleet based at Scapa Flow, as a TB Target and PV ranging vessel. In 1939 she was deployed for convoy defence in the Western Approaches. On 13 October 1939 while at Rosyth, Sabre was heavily damaged when rammed by the armed merchant cruiser . Sabre was under repair until 6 May 1940. Operation Dynamo (27 May - 4 June 1940) As part of the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, Sabre was conspicuous in the evacuation of British and French soldiers from the beaches of beaches at Malo-les-Bains and the harbour mole during the Dunkirk evacuation. During nine days and nights of the evacuation, despite being damaged in an air attack, Sabre made ten round trips to Dunkirk. An example of her activity at this time: ::In the early hours of 28 May, three ships boats from HMS Sabre picked up 100 men in two hours, from the beaches at Malo-Les-Bains to the east of the harbour mole. Then it was full speed to Dover with a turnaround of only 58 minutes, and the ship was back again at the Dunkirk harbour mole at 11:00 am, where they loaded a further 800 men. Departing at 12:30 pm, by now the ships weight had increased considerably, lowering her propeller draft. This meant because of the falling tide and a defective echo sounder, Lieutenant-Commander Dean had to slowly edge her passage through the shallows. She arrived back in Dover at 6:20 pm. Refuelled, she was back to the Dunkirk mole at 10.30pm, the third trip of the day. This time, the ship stayed for only 35 minutes picking up another 500 troops.Lord, p116 Finally on 4 June just after 2:00 pm, the Admiralty announced the end of Operation Dynamo. All together an armada of over 860 ships, including 39 destroyers, had taken part in the evacuation of troops from the beaches and harbour. The Admiralty calculated the total British and Allied troops landed in England amounted to 338,226 troops rescued. Sabre had made more round trips than most and brought back to Dover a total of 5,765 soldiers ‚Äì amongst the highest number for any individual ship. Lieutenant- Commander Dean was awarded a DSO ‚ÄìDistinguished Service Order on 6 June. Sabres midshipman ‚ÄòTeddy‚Äô Archdale was mentioned in despatches. (Edward Archdale went on to become a distinguished gunnery officer in the submarine ). Operation Ariel (15 ‚Äì 25 June 1940) After Dunkirk there were still Allied forces to be evacuated from other French ports along the coast westward so the navy had further work to do. ‚ÄòOperation Cycle' launched on 10 June rescued some 11,000 from the English Channel port of Le Havre. Then on 12 June Sabre was deployed to help with the evacuation of still more British and Allied forces in ‚ÄòOperation Ariel‚Äô from the rest of France. It began with the evacuation of Cherbourg and continued for the next ten days, moving south to St Nazaire, Bordeaux and right down to the Franco-Spanish border. Sabre was sent to Alderney the northerly island amongst the Channel Islands on 23 June and helped evacuate around 1,400 islanders to safety in Weymouth. The final Allied evacuation of France ended on 25 June. By that time a further 215,000 servicemen and civilians had been saved, however although successful, Operations 'Aerial' and 'Cycle' never captured the public's imagination like ‚ÄòOperation Dynamo‚Äô. Rescuing evacuated children from SS Volendam, (30 August - 1 September 1940) In September 1940 Sabre was detailed to meet the first slow Atlantic convoy, as it approached the United Kingdom from Canada. A Finnish merchant ship, Elle, 3,868 tons was torpedoed at 04:25am on 28 August and Sabre joined the hunt for the German U-boat without success. Then two days later, during the evening of 30 August off Malin Head Sabre helped rescue the survivors of a torpedoed Dutch ship, the 15,434 ton Holland America line, .Gourock Times 6 Sep 1940 She was in an outward bound convoy OB 205 for Canada, carrying 879 passengers and 273 crew members. This included 320 children with their escorts under the Children's Overseas Reception Board scheme some as young as five, together with 286 other passengers. They were taken to various west coast ports in Scotland. (Volendam did not sink, and was eventually taken in tow by the rescue tug and beached on the Isle of Bute. Repaired in 1941 she returned to war service). Tory Island incident December 1940 In December Sabre, whilst escorting an inbound convoy SC 13 into Liverpool, was involved with a rescue attempt as described later in a book. Recently she had been badly damaged in a brave attempt to rescue the crew of a Dutch ship, , which had run ashore on Tory Island on the northwestern coast of Ireland in a full gale. The Sabre went in so close that she was almost among the breakers; and one great wave swept her decks, flattening the bridge and taking with it all the upper-deck fittings. The captain (Lt.Cdr. B. Dean, RN) had been badly injured and was still in hospital, but his was the worst injury, and no one had been lost.Convoy Escort Commander, Sir Peter Gretton, London, Cassell & Company Ltd., p 59 Sabre put into [Londonderry] on December 7 and sailed to Larne, Northern Ireland, for repairs on 18 January 1941 under command of Lieutenant Peter Gretton. Further convoy rescue off St Kilda 1941 At 7:54 pm on 31 December 1941, the British Motor Tanker Cardita, 8,237 tons (Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co Ltd), a straggler from convoy HX 166, en route Cura√ßao to Shellhaven (Thames Estuary), was torpedoed by from St Kilda. The vessel foundered on 3 January 1942. Out of the ship's crew, 27 were lost, 23 were picked up by and a further 10 crew members by Sabre and landed at Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. In March 1942 after a successful ‚ÄòWarship Week‚Äô National Savings campaign Sabre was adopted by the civil community of Bebington, Cheshire, the same month she was detached for escort of the Russian Convoy PQ 13 during its initial stage of passage to Iceland in the Northwest Approaches. For most of the war Sabre was attached to 1st Escort Group based at Liverpool and then 21st Escort Group for convoy defence in NW Approaches. In 1943 she was deployed for Atlantic convoy defence, in 1944 Atlantic convoy defence and support based in Iceland. In 1945 Sabre deployed for coastal convoy defence in UK waters. At the end of World War II Sabre was placed on the disposal list and sold to be broken up for scrap in November 1945, arriving at the breaker‚Äôs yard at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth in 1946.

Removing the wattles is sometimes called \\"dewattling\\". Procedure To perform dubbing, the tissues are first disinfected and, if available, an anesthetic is applied to limit pain. Sterile scissors or dubbing shears are used to cut the tissues off, and a styptic, an astringent chemical that reduces bleeding, is applied. The wounds are left uncovered. Some recommend dubbing should be done on day old chicks whilst others advise waiting until the bird's comb is more developed. Benefits Dubbing is sometimes performed to limit damage caused by injury or frostbite. Dubbing for some breeds has become a tradition and is required for some birds to meet breed-specifications. Other reasons include removing combs which have become so large they prevent the bird from taking food into its mouth or making the head so heavy it sinks into the bird's chest. In the US, the National Chicken Council (2003) listed dubbing of cockerels as one of the acceptable procedures that may cause short-term stress but which are necessary for the long-term welfare of the flock. Dubbing is also performed to prevent injuries from other birds or while being kept in pens. Criticism In practice, an anesthetic is rarely used during dubbing and as a consequence, the RSPCA Australia is opposed to dubbing on poultry intended to be exhibited at shows, and describes the practice as a cause of pain and distress. The comb and wattles function in thermoregulation; blood circulating from the comb and the wattles helps the bird lose heat during hot weather. The comb is also used in mate-assessment in some poultry species.Jones, E.K.M. and Prescott, N.B., (2000). Visual cues used in the choice of mate by fowl and their potential importance for the breeder industry. World's Poultry Science Journal, 56: 127-138. Dubbing would interfere with both these functions of the comb and wattles. In commercial laying hens, those dubbed at hatching exhibit few effects on egg production but the older the birds are when dubbed, the greater the negative effects of dubbing.Fairfull, R.W., Crober, D.C. and Gowe, R.S., (1985). Effects of comb dubbing on the performance of laying stocks. Poultry Science, 64: 434‚Äì439. In the UK, the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) concludes \\"that removal of the comb offers no welfare advantages to offset the disturbance caused by the procedure and believe the practice should be phased out.\\" The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) writes: \\"Removal of the comb offers few, if any, welfare advantages in comparison with the disturbance and pain likely to be caused and should be avoided.\\" The Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 (Schedule 3 Amendment) Order 1988 (SI 1988 No. 526) permits only a veterinary surgeon to remove the combs of a domestic fowl which has reached the age of 72 hours. In New Zealand, the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee stated in 2002 they were \\"working towards a strategy to prevent this practice.\\" In 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed scientific evidence and concluded \\"that no mutilation with an effect on welfare as severe as those resulting from cutting off toes or dubbing the comb should be carried out unless justified by evidence for a substantial and unavoidable level of poor welfare in the birds themselves and other birds.\\" See also * Debeaking/beak trimming * Fighting cock * Overview of discretionary invasive procedures on animals References Category:Poultry farming Category:Bird health Category:Animal welfare Category:Cruelty to animals Category:Poultry ","title":"Dubbing (poultry)"},{"id":"33964313","title":"1934 Kenyan general election"},{"id":"33964321","text":"Nowness (stylized NOWNESS) is a digital video channel that was launched in 2010 by its founder Jefferson Hack as a brand of LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE.\\"LVMH Launches Nowness.com...\\" Corcoran, Kate T.

Life  Ernest was a son of Duke Albert II of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel- G√∂ttingen and his wife, Rixa of Werle. In the division of 1286, his father had received the Principality of G√∂ttingen and in 1292, he inherited Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel from his childless brother William I. After his father's death in 1318, Ernest's older brother Otto the Mild took up government. After Otto died childless in 1344, Ernest and his older brother Magnus I divided the Duchy. Ernest received the Principality of G√∂ttingen, which would remain separated from the rest of Brunswick for a while. The principality of G√∂ttingen, also known as the Upper Forest, was the poorest of the Welf principalities. It consisted at this time of the former County of Northeim, the cities of G√∂ttingen, Uslar, Dransfeld, Munden and Gieselwerder and one half of Moringen. The city of Brunswick remained shared property of the various Dukes of Brunswick. In 1339, Ernest married Elizabeth, a daughter of Landgrave Henry II \\"the Iron\\" of Hesse. With her, he had at least six children. The best known of these is his successor, Otto I. A younger son joined the clergy. Around the year 1364, Ernest handed some of the government business to his son Otto I. After Ernest's death in 1367, Otto I took over completely. Not much is known about Ernest's rule, unlike his son's time in office. It is assumed that, like his predecessors, he fought alongside the cities in the area against the noble robber barons who held castles in the area. In his last years, he mostly lived in peace with his neighbours and had alliances with many of them. He was only at war with the Bishopric of Hildesheim and its allies, Mainz, Hesse, Waldeck and Hohnstein.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Tor Books in March 1988, and was reprinted in April 1997. Plot During a prologue set in the Varikiel Marshes of northern Nemedia, a farm boy named Lar is bitten by a snake. The scene then switches to Conan, attempting to escape a Nemedian prison. While his attempted escape is thwarted, it does bring the Cimmerian to the attention of someone powerful, and he soon finds himself recruited to serve as a body-double for Favian, son of Baron Durwald from Dinadar. Favian and Conan both resemble each other, because Favian's mother was also a Cimmerian. Since the young noble is a spoiled brat, the two never hit it off well. Conan receives a lecturer on upper-class Nemedian society, etiquette, and swordplay, though he finds civilized fencing rather weak in comparison to his broadsword. He remains suspicious of his new employer, at one point following Durwald as he goes inside a crypt, seemingly for the purposes of ancestral worship. His resentment towards Favian is cemented after he catches the lord whipping Ludya, a serving girl who Conan previously befriended, and intervenes to protect her. The matter is eventually resolved, and Ludya is removed from Favian's attention by returning her to the Varikiel Marshes. Soon, while learning the use of a chariot, the party Conan is with are ambushed. He and Favian drive away their attackers, and later get involved in putting down a local \\"rebellion\\" ‚Äî which proves nothing more than the villagers' attempt to avoid the tolls at a royal bridge by establishing their own ferry. This and Favian's use of the right of droit du seigneur after a wedding, bring the barbarian's view of Nemedian nobility to an all-time low. Everything changes when Favian is murdered by a woman who he attempts to exercise his \\"rights\\" on. It turns out she was merely using Favian's lust to lure him to his death. Conan recognizes the woman as one of their attackers, and also a damsel he had saved from rape during a raid on the village. However, Conan has little time to ponder this development, as he quickly finds himself accused of having killed both Favian and his employer, Baron Durwald. Soon, the castle is invaded by a spectral band of warrior, who are defeated only by the intervention of a host of actual rebels under the command of Durwald's disillusioned cousin. Conan, to avoid being executed for murder, sides with the newcomers. With the legitimate ruler and his heir dead, the two sides come to an agreement; they will form a new council to rule over Nemedia with Conan, impersonating Favian, as their puppet baron. Conan is less than pleased with their arrangement. This state of affairs is interrupted by ominous tidings from the Varikiel Marshes and a plea for aid by Baron Ulf, ruler of the region. Conan, concerned about Ludya, joins a calvary his master sent out to relieve Ulf. The army finds a devastated landscape burned, pillaged, and emptied of its inhabitants. The devastation is the work of a cult worshipping the Stygian god, Set. Days later, the soldiers encounter a fleeing band of natives, all driven insane by Set's plague of serpents. Among them is Baron Ulf, who regains enough sanity to warn of an ambush, and of a high priest of Set behind the invasion. In the ensuing battle, many of the soldiers are killed by a giant viper. Guided by Ulf's directions, Conan goes in search of the priest of Set. The center of Set's plague is actually Ludya's village, and the \\"priest\\" Lar, the boy from the prologue, is the plague's first victim. Soon, Conan realizes Lar is evidently acting as the agent of a supernatural entity. Conan finds Ludya and frees her from the cult's control; she fills in the missing pieces of the puzzle. To get near the boy, both act as if they are under the influence of Set's plague. Their wariness proves wise when Lar sheds his skin and reveals himself as a reptilian monstrosity which Conan, in horror, impulsively batters to death with his warhammer. With Lar's demise, his evil army goes to pieces; some of his followers, now revealed as animated corpses, rapidly decompose, while the natives are reawaken into sanity. Conan returns to Dinadar with Ludya, abandons his guise of Favian, and strikes out for the south, eager to see the last of Nemedia. Reception Reviewer Don D'Ammassa calls \\"Carpenter's third Conan novel ... much better than the first two\\" (Conan the Renegade and Conan the Raider), and \\"surprisingly enjoyable,\\" noting \\"[t]he story is quite methodically developed and well paced and the characters are much more complex than in the previous books.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan the Warlord\\" (review on Critical Mass).

Their legspan sometimes reaches 10 inches (25 cm) in females, and is probably the second largest of the genus, behind Poecilotheria rufilata. Name The name Poecilotheria is derived from Greek \\"poikilos\\" - spotted and \\"therion\\" - wild beast. Ornata refers to \\"adorned to\\". This whole genus of arboreal tarantulas exhibits an intricate fractal-like pattern on the abdomen. Identification The species is easily distinguishable by other tiger spiders due to greenish yellow or purplish carapace in dorsal surface. Ventrally, there is a proximal white spot on femur of fourth pair of legs. Description Female Dorsally, carapace has greenish yellow or purplish tinge. Femur is greenish tinge with a purplish tinge. Tibia has two parallel lines of oblong yellow spots. All legs possess reddish brown setae and setae are more prominent on pedipalps and chelicerae. Ventrally, first and second leg pairs are identical, with ground color yellow. Femur is also yellow. Tibia is bright yellow colored. Third and fourth leg pairs are identical. Ground color of them are yellow. Femur is black with centrally located large blue-grey spot. Male Dorsally greenish brown colored. Markings are less prominent. Ventrally, identical to female. Yellow spots can be seen on third and fourth leg pairs. Behavior The P. ornata behavior parallels that of many arboreal spiders. In the wild the P. ornata live in holes of tall trees where they make asymmetric funnel webs. Their primary prey consists of various flying insects, which they catch manually (not in a web) and paralyze. It is not unknown for the spiders of this genus to live communally when territory, i.e. number of holes per tree, is limited. The spider is noted to have a possibly mutualistic relationship with frogs such as Ramanella nagaoi, sharing tree holes of which some were observed to contain eggs and/or juveniles from the spider, frog, or both. As observed between frog Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata and tarantula Xenesthis immanis, the spider may protect the frog from predators while the frog protects the spider's eggs from ants. Bites Although there has never been a recorded death from any tarantula bite this species is considered to have a medically significant bite, with venom that may cause intense pain, and extreme muscle cramping judging from the experience of keepers bitten by this species.Schmidt, G.

The school is named after the Romantic poet Friedrich H√∂lderlin, a native of Lauffen. History The school can be traced back to 1491, when Eberhard I, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, established a Pr√§dikatur. Martin Larin is mentioned in 1506 as the first official schoolmaster; prior to that, the priest had held the office of teacher. When the Reformation reached W√ºrttemberg in the mid-16th century, the Pr√§dikatur was merged with the Latin school, established by Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg, whose purpose was to educate the children of W√ºrttemberg officials and theologians. By 1520 17 students had enrolled at the universities of Heidelberg and T√ºbingen, some of whom later served as pastors in Lauffen.Otfried Kies: Die Merowingerburg im Dorf ‚Äì Keimzelle Lauffens. In: Heimatbuch der Stadt Lauffen am Neckar anl√§√ülich des gro√üen Stadtfests im Jahre 1984. Stadt Lauffen am Neckar, Lauffen am Neckar 1984, S. 103‚Äì118. From 1835, several Royal Decrees converted single-class Latin schools into secondary schools. In Lauffen, these decrees were implemented after the death of the preceptor Christoph Jakob Klunzinger, who had worked at the school since 1812. The aim of this transformation was \\"partly to promote the general civic education, partly to make pupils fit for the various civil professions\\".Tanja Blattner: Die erstrebte Umwandlung w√ºrttembergischer Lateinschulen in Realschulen von 1835 bis 1848. V und R Unipress, G√∂ttingen 2006, , S. 181 The transformation, however, met with opposition from some parents, and a group of 49 people expressed their opposition. After a minister was called in, an initial compromise was reached which envisioned the school as a Realschule that would also teach Latin. From 1838 a state grant of 200 gulden was provided to fund the implementation of this compromise proposal, but in subsequent years it was the subject of continuous quarrels. Starting in 1848, the school operated as a Latin school again. During the First World War the school consisted of two classes; during the Second World War it was designated an Oberschule and had four classes. In 1954 the school became the H√∂lderlin Progymnasium in the newly built school H√∂lderlinschule on H√∂lderlinstra√üe. The Progymnasium, the new Volksschule, part of the H√∂lderlinschule, and the Herzog-Ulrich- Volksschule shared staff until the organisational separation of the Herzog- Ulrich-Volksschule in 1962. In 1967 the school was converted into a full Gymnasium, and in 1970 administered its first Abitur examinations. In 1975 the H√∂lderlin-Gymnasium moved into a new complex in the western part of the city. Sources *Otfried Kies: Festschrift 500 Jahre Lateinschule und H√∂lderlin- Gymnasium Lauffen am Neckar.

The term was coined by Nancy Peluso in 1995 to describe the commissioning of maps by forest users in Kalimantan, Indonesia, as a means of contesting state maps of forest areas that typically undermined indigenous interests. The resultant counter-hegemonic maps had the ability to strengthen forest users' resource claims. There are numerous expressions closely related to counter-mapping: ethnocartography, alternative cartography, mapping-back, counter-hegemonic mapping, and public participatory mapping. Moreover, the terms: critical cartography, subversive cartography, bio-regional mapping, and remapping are sometimes used interchangeably with counter-mapping, but in practice encompass much more. Whilst counter-mapping still primarily refers to indigenous cartographic efforts, it is increasingly being applied to non-indigenous mapping initiatives in economically developed countries. Such counter-mapping efforts have been facilitated by processes of neoliberalism, and technological democratisation. Examples of counter-mapping include attempts to demarcate and protect traditional territories, community mapping, Public Participatory Geographical Information Systems, and mapping by a relatively weak state to counter the resource claims of a stronger state. The power of counter-maps to advocate policy change in a bottom-up manner led commentators to affirm that counter-mapping should be viewed as a tool of governance. Despite its emancipatory potential, counter-mapping has not gone without criticism. There is a tendency for counter-mapping efforts to overlook the knowledge of women, minorities, and other vulnerable, disenfranchised groups. From this perspective, counter-mapping is only empowering for a small subset of society, whilst others become further marginalised.  Origins  Nancy Peluso, professor of forest policy, coined the term 'counter-mapping' in 1995, having examined the implementation of two forest mapping strategies in Kalimantan. One set of maps belonged to state forest managers, and the international financial institutions that supported them, such as the World Bank. This strategy recognised mapping as a means of protecting local claims to territory and resources to a government that had previously ignored them. The other set of maps had been created by Indonesian NGOs, who often contract international experts to assist with mapping village territories. The goal of the second set of maps was to co-opt the cartographic conventions of the Indonesian state, to legitimise the claims by the Dayak people, indigenous to Kalimantan, to the rights to forest use. Counter-mappers in Kalimantan have acquired GIS technologies, satellite technology, and computerised resource management tools, consequently making the Indonesian state vulnerable to counter-maps. As such, counter-mapping strategies in Kalimantan have led to successful community action to block, and protest against, oil palm plantations and logging concessions imposed by the central government. It must, however, be recognised that counter-mapping projects existed long before coinage of the term. Counter-maps are rooted in map art practices that date to the early 20th century; in the mental maps movement of the 1960s; in indigenous and bioregional mapping; and parish mapping.  Parish Maps Project  In 1985, the charity Common Ground launched the Parish Maps Project, a bottom-up initiative encouraging local people to map elements of the environment valued by their parish. Since then, more than 2,500 English parishes have made such maps. Parish mapping projects aim to put every local person in an 'expert' role. Clifford exemplifies this notion, affirming: \\"making a parish map is about creating a community expression of values, and about beginning to assert ideas for involvement. It is about taking the place in your own hands\\". The final map product is typically an artistic artefact, usually painted, and often displayed in village halls or schools. By questioning the biases of cartographic conventions and challenging predominant power effects of mapping, The Parish Maps Project is an early example of what Peluso went on to term 'counter-mapping'  Development   Neoliberalism  The development of counter-mapping can be situated within the neoliberal political-economic restructuring of the state. Prior to the 1960s, equipping a map-making enterprise was chiefly the duty of a single agency, funded by the national government. In this sense, maps have conventionally been the products of privileged knowledges. However, processes of neoliberalism, predominantly since the late 1970s, have reconfigured the state's role in the cartographic project. Neoliberalism denotes an emphasis on markets and minimal states, whereby individual choice is perceived to have replaced the mass-production of commodities. The fact that citizens are now performing cartographic functions that were once exclusively state-controlled can be partially explained through a shift from \\"roll-back neoliberalism\\", in which the state dismantled some of its functions, to \\"roll-out neoliberalism\\", in which new modes of operating have been constructed. In brief, the state can be seen to have \\"hollowed out\\" and delegated some of its mapping power to citizens. = Counter-mapping as Neoliberal Governmentality = Governmentality refers to a particular form of state power that is exercised when citizens self-discipline by acquiescing to state knowledge. Historically, cartography has been a fundamental governmentality strategy, a technology of power, used for surveillance and control. Competing claimants and boundaries made no appearance on state-led maps. This links to Foucault's notion of \\"subjugated knowledges\\" - ones that did not rise to the top, or were disqualified. However, through neoliberalising processes, the state has retracted from performing some of its cartographic functions. Consequently, rather than being passive recipients of top-down map distribution, people now have the opportunity to claim sovereignty over the mapping process. In this new regime of neoliberal cartographic governmentality the \\"insurrection of subjugated knowledges\\" occurs, as counter-mapping initiatives incorporate previously marginalised voices.  Technological democratisation?  In response to technological change, predominantly since the 1980s, cartography has increasingly been democratised. The wide availability of high-quality location information has enabled mass-market cartography based on Global Positioning System receivers, home computers, and the internet. The fact that civilians are using technologies which were once elitist led Brosius et al. to assert that counter-mapping involves \\"stealing the master's tools\\". Nevertheless, numerous early counter-mapping projects successfully utilised manual techniques, and many still use them. For instance, in recent years, the use of simple sketch mapping approaches has been revitalised, whereby maps are made on the ground, using natural materials.. Similarly, the use of scale model constructions and felt boards, as means of representing cartographic claims of different groups, have become increasingly popular. Consequently, Wood et al. assert that counter-mappers can \\"make gateau out of technological crumbs\\". = Public Participation Geographical Information Systems = In recent years, Public Participation Geographical Information Systems (PPGIS) have attempted to take the power of the map out of the hands of the cartographic elite, putting it into the hands of the people. For instance, Kyem designed a PPGIS method termed Exploratory Strategy for Collaboration, Management, Allocation, and Planning (ESCMAP). The method sought to integrate the concerns and experiences of three rural communities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana into official forest management practices. Kyem concluded that, notwithstanding the potential of PPGIS, it is possible that the majority of the rich and powerful people in the area would object to some of the participatory uses of GIS. For example, loggers in Ghana affirmed that the PPGIS procedures were too open and democratic. Thus, despite its democratising potential, there are barriers to its implementation. More recently, Wood et al. disputed the notion of PPGIS entirely, affirming that it is \\"scarcely GIS, intensely hegemonic, hardly public, and anything but participatory\\".  Counter-mapping as governance  Governance makes problematic state-centric notions of regulation, recognising that there has been a shift to power operating across several spatial scales. Similarly, counter-mapping complicates state distribution of cartography, advocating bottom-up participatory mapping projects (see GIS and environmental governance). Counter-mapping initiatives, often without state assistance, attempt to exert power. As such, counter-mapping conforms to Jessop's notion of \\"governance without government\\". Another characteristic of governance is its \\"purposeful effort to steer, control or manage sectors or facets of society\\" towards a common goal. Likewise, as maps exude power and authority, they are a trusted medium with the ability to 'steer' society in a particular direction. In brief, cartography, once the tool of kings and governments, is now being used as a tool of governance - to advocate policy change from the grassroots. The environmental sphere is one context in which counter-mapping has been utilised as a governance tool.  Counter-mapping as environmental governance  In contrast to expert knowledges, lay knowledges are increasingly valuable to decision-makers, in part due to the scientific uncertainty surrounding environmental issues. Participatory counter-mapping projects are an effective means of incorporating lay knowledges into issues surrounding environmental governance. For instance, counter-maps depicting traditional use of areas now protected for biodiversity have been used to allow resource use, or to promote public debate about the issue, rather than forcing relocation. For example, the World Wide Fund for Nature used the results of counter-mapping to advocate for the reclassification of several strictly protected areas into Indonesian national parks, including Kayan Mentarang and Gunung Lorentz. The success of such counter-mapping efforts led Alcorn to affirm that governance (grassroots mapping projects), rather than government (top-down map distribution), offers the best hope for good natural resource management. In short, it can be seen that \\"maps are powerful political tools in ecological and governance discussions\\".  Types of counter-mapping  Numerous counter-mapping types exist, for instance: protest maps, map art, counter-mapping for conservation, and PPGIS. In order to emphasise the wide scope of what has come to be known as counter-mapping, three contrasting counter-mapping examples are elucidated in this section: indigenous counter-mapping, community mapping, and state counter-mapping, respectively.  Indigenous counter-mapping  Counter-mapping has been undertaken most in the Third World. Indigenous peoples are increasingly turning to participatory mapping, appropriating both the state's techniques and manner of representation. Counter-mapping is a tool for indigenous identity-building, and for bolstering the legitimacy of customary resource claims. The success of counter-mapping in realising indigenous claims can be seen through Nietschmann's assertion: = Creation of Nunavut = The power of indigenous counter-mapping can be exemplified through the creation of Nunavut. In 1967, Frank Arthur Calder and the Nisaga'a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the Province of British Columbia for a declaration that aboriginal title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the Canadian Supreme Court found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating treaties with the people who had not signed them. As a first step, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada studied Inuit land occupancy in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project. Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry- pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives. As Usher noted: These maps played a fundamental role in the negotiations that enabled the Inuit to assert an aboriginal title to the 2 million km¬≤ in Canada, today known as Nunavut. Evidently, counter-mapping is a tool by which indigenous groups can re-present the world in ways which destabilise dominant representations. Indigenous peoples have begun remapping areas of the world that were once occupied by their ancestors as an act of reclamation of land stolen from them by country governments. Indigenous peoples have begun this process all over the world from the Indigenous peoples from the United States, Aboriginal peoples from Australia, and Amazonian people from Brazil. The people of the lands have begun creating their own maps of the land in terms of the borders of the territory and pathways around the territory. When Native peoples first began this process it was done by hand, but presently GPS systems and other technological mapping devices are used. Indigenous maps are reconceptualizing the \\"average\\" map and creatively representing space as well as the culture of those who live in the space. Indigenous people are creating maps that are for their power and social benefit instead of the ones forced on them through different titling, and description. Indigenous peoples are also creating maps to adjust to the contamination and pollution that is present In their land. Specifically in Peru, Indigenous peoples are using mapping to identify problem areas and innovating and creating strategies to combat these risks for the future.  Perspectives on the Land (United States)  White colonists saw land as property and a commodity to be possessed. As a result, as settlers grew in numbers and journeyed west, land was claimed and sold for profit. White colonists would ‚Äúdevelop‚Äù the land and take ownership of it, believing the land was theirs to own. Indigenous peoples, on the other hand, saw themselves as connected with the land spiritually and that the land, instead owned them. Land to Aboriginal people is a major part of their identity and spirituality. They saw the land as being sacred and needing to be protected. Indigenous peoples believe it is their responsibility to take care of the land. As Marion Kickett states in her research, ‚ÄúLand is very important to Aboriginal people with the common belief of 'we don‚Äôt own the land, the land owns us'. Aboriginal people have always had a spiritual connection to their land...\\" These differing perspectives on land caused many disputes during the era of Manifest Destiny and as white settler populations began to increase and move into Indigenous peoples‚Äô territory. The Indigenous people believed they were to serve the land while white colonists believed the land should serve them. As a result, when the two sides came in contact, they disputed over how to \\"claim\\" land. The height of this conflict began to occur during Manifest Destinyas the white colonist population began to grow and move westward into more parts of Indigenous lands and communities.  The Process of Mapping (United States)  Maps represent and reflect how an individual or society names and projects themselves onto nature, literally and symbolically. Mapping, while seemingly objective is political and a method of control on territory.Mapmaking has thus both socio-cultural (myth-making) and technical (utilitarian and economic) functions and traditions. The difference between boundaries and territories made by the White colonists and Indigenous people were vastly different, and expressed their views on the land and nature. Indigenous peoples' territory often ended at rivers, mountains, and hills or were defined by relationships between different tribes, resources, and trade networks. The relationships between tribes would determine the access to the land and its resources. Instead of the borders being hard edges like the United States‚Äô, border on Indigenous peoples‚Äô lands were more fluid and would change based on marriages between chiefs and their family members, hunting clans, and heredity. In Indigenous maps the landmarks would be drawn on paper and in some cases described. Detailed knowledge of the thickness of ice, places of shelter and predators were placed in maps to inform the user for what to look for when in the territory. Maps made by White colonists in America were first based on populations, created territories based on the edges of civilization. After the creation of the United States government, state land was designated by Congress and intended to be given equally by latitude and longitudinal coordinates. The ending of railroad tracks and crossings also designated the ending of one state to another, creating a fence-like boundary. In a special case, after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase, the United States had to decide between the territory where slavery was legal and where it was not. The Missouri Compromisewas birthed as a result and a boundary line was created at the longitude and latitude lines of 36‚Äô30‚Äù. The states were documented by their coordinates and borders were made at the numbered locations. These numbered locations would stretch for miles and encompass all in that territory even if it belonged to Indigenous peoples‚Äô. That is often how land would be stolen from Indigenous peoples. The land that would be \\"claimed\\" by the United States Government would stretch across Indigenous lands without consideration of their borders. Indigenous peoples' lands were absorbed by the borders of America's newly mapped states and were forced out as a result. Their livelihoods and mythology tied to the land was also destroyed. White colonists claimed the land for their own and Indigenous peoples were no longer allowed to occupy the space. Another way was the differences in the way each group mapped the land. The United States Government would not recognize a Tribes territory without a map and most tribes did not have maps that were in the style of European maps, therefore they were ignored.  Community mapping  Community mapping can be defined as: \\"local mapping, produced collaboratively, by local people and often incorporating alternative local knowledge\\". OpenStreetMap is an example of a community mapping initiative, with the potential to counter the hegemony of state-dominated map distribution. = OpenStreetMap = OpenStreetMap home page. OpenStreetMap (OSM), a citizen-led spatial data collection website, was founded by Steve Coast in 2004. Data are collected from diverse public domain sources; of which GPS tracks are the most important, collected by volunteers with GPS receivers. there were 340,522 registered OSM users, who had uploaded 2.121 billion GPS points onto the website. The process of map creation explicitly relies upon sharing and participation; consequently, every registered OSM user can edit any part of the map. Moreover, 'map parties' - social events which aim to fill gaps in coverage, help foster a community ethos. In short, the grassroots OSM project can be seen to represent a paradigm shift in who creates and shares geographic information - from the state, to society. However, rather than countering the state-dominated cartographic project, some commentators have affirmed that OSM merely replicates the 'old' socio-economic order. For instance, Haklay affirmed that OSM users in the United Kingdom tend not to map council estates; consequently, middle-class areas are disproportionately mapped. Thus, in opposition to notions that OSM is a radical cartographic counter-culture, are contentions that OSM \\"simply recreates a mirror copy of existing topographic mapping\\".  State counter-mapping  What has come to be known as counter-mapping is not limited to the activities of non-state actors within a particular nation- state; relatively weak states also engage in counter-mapping in an attempt to challenge other states. = Competing cartographic representations: East Timor versus Australia = East Timor's on-going effort to gain control of gas and oil resources from Australia, which it perceives at its own, is a form of counter-mapping. This dispute involves a cartographic contestation of Australia's mapping of the seabed resources between the two countries. As Nevins contends: whilst Australia's map is based on the status quo - a legacy of a 1989 agreement between Australia and the Indonesian occupier of East Timor at that time, East Timor's map represents an enlarged notion of what its sea boundaries should be, thereby entailing a redrawing of the map. This form of counter-mapping thus represents a claim by a relatively weak state, East Timor, to territory and resources that are controlled by a stronger state, Australia. However, Nevins notes that there is limited potential of realising a claim through East Timor's counter-map: counter-mapping is an effective strategy only when combined with broader legal and political strategies.  Criticisms  Counter-mapping's claim to incorporate counter-knowledges, and thereby empower traditionally disempowered people, has not gone uncontested. A sample of criticisms leveled at counter-mapping: * Counter-mapping fails to recognise that community is a constantly shifting, fluid process, too often relying on a notion of community as bounded and fixed. As such, the process of mapping communicates and naturalises who does, and who does not, belong within particular boundaries. * Due to the power imbalance between indigenous claims and those of the state, the language and tools of the dominant society must be used by those under its control. The process of using another's tools can change the ideas represented, resulting in a map of unpredictable quality. * Counter-mapping is in danger of becoming the 'thing to do'; a \\"magic bullet applied uncritically\\". * There is a geography to the success of counter- mapping. In Tibet, counter-mapping is of limited political utility as mapmaking is not enfranchised and cannot be scaled up, for instance, to settle legal battles over land tenure and resource rights through the regulatory offices of the state. * Counter-mapping projects utilising GIS require significant knowledge and computer literacy above that of lay individuals. * Investment in specialised computers and software often results in prohibitive mapping costs for a large majority of local people, particularly in poor areas. As some groups prove more capable of adopting the technologies than others, counter-mapping projects can deepen divisions within communities along gender and economic lines. To summarise, whilst counter-mapping has the potential to transform map-making from \\"a science of princes\\", the investment required to create a map with the ability to challenge state-produced cartography means that counter-mapping is unlikely to become a \\"science of the masses\\".

In most multi-way speakers, it is at the crossover frequency that the effects of lobing are of greatest concern, since this determines how well the speaker preserves the tonality of the original recorded content.Loudspeaker Handbook by John Eargle, page 120 In practice, room-effects and interactions largely mean that the ideal loudspeaker (or combination thereof) is not practically possible. However a speaker that has the best dispersion at all frequencies of interest (especially the crossover frequency), will have the least colouration of sound - i.e., it will most faithfully reproduce the recorded material. Thus, an ideal speaker would have no lobes at all frequencies - in other words it will act as a point source radiating omnidirectionally at all frequencies. In practice all speakers will exhibit some amount of lobing at the crossover frequency. The primary reasons for this are the physical distance between the drivers, and the drivers' effective diameters relative to the frequency of interest. Lobing is measured as having a comb filtering response (i.e., areas of peaks and dips) as the listening position varies vertically‚Ä° w.r.t. the nominal on-axis position. Since a true spherical wavefront cannot be achieved in practice, designers try to make the lobe as wide as possible at the crossover frequency, such that at typical listening positions, the speaker appears omnidirectional.  Lobe formation  For the sake of simplicity, the following assumes two point sources separated by a distance d vertically‚Ä°, both radiating into half-space at a certain frequency f. Thus we can express lobing as a function of d and its relation to the wavelength Œª. As d becomes significant (or larger) as compared to Œª, the acoustic wavefront starts becoming narrower or more directive. The following image shows a simplified representation of how two non-coincident drivers exhibit lobing (the difference between the lobing patterns is greatly exaggerated to demonstrate the effect): Lobing The large black dot is the vertical listening position relative to the centre, at a certain fixed horizontal distance from the speaker. For wavelengths much greater than d, the wavefront is almost spherical (circular, when seen from the side) and the sound level is constant for a variety of such listening positions - the off-axis response of the speaker is almost omnidirectional. As the distance d approaches Œª/4, the wavefront starts becoming narrower. At the listening position, the sound level is not the same as it would have been, had it been exactly midway between the drivers. The area where the sound level is constant for a given range of vertical positions (and fixed listening distance) is the lobe. Outside the lobe, the sound level is much less and this is what causes the speaker to have a change in tonality as one's listening height changes. Note: For an individual driver this effect is known as directivity, and is observable in both vertical and horizontal planes, and d is now the driver's diameter relative to the wavelength, whereas, the lobing pattern due to two or more drivers is primarily an effect in the vertical plane, as a result of the distance between the two drivers. The physical reason for a lobe to form is the fact that at any point that is at a position unequal from both drivers, at certain frequencies (i.e., wavelengths) and depending on d and relative difference between the distances to the listening position, the wavefronts from each driver will interfere constructively or destructively. This constructive or destructive interference happens due to the relative phases of the waves from each driver as they reach the listening position. Thus, for any given frequency, there will be a minimum distance from the speaker below which there will be radical changes in sound level as the listening position is changed vertically. And this distance becomes larger as the distance between the drivers increases. Thus, the best compromise is obtained when, for practical listening distances, we can choose drivers large enough to cover as much of the audio band as possible but at the same time small enough so they can be as closely spaced as possible as to appear as a point source for any practical listening distance.Loudspeaker Handbook by John Eargle, page 123 ‚Ä° - The article assumes a typical loudspeaker configuration where multiple drivers are arranged vertically. Therefore, the lobing phenomenon is observable in the vertical plane. For horizontally arranged drivers, the lobing phenomenon would be observable in the horizontal plane.

The novel was relatively well received by reviewers and was shortlisted for an Encore Award in 1999. Plot Set in 1763, this novel centres round the historical figure of Giacomo Casanova and loosely follows his autobiographical Histoire de ma vie. The plot of the novel concerns Casanova falling for a woman and having, for the first time, to deal with rejection and the pain which it causes him. Reception The novel was relatively well received with reviewers praising Millers prose and sense of place. Critics of the novel cited Millers basic plot and lack of originality when compared with Casanova's own Histoire de ma vie. The novel was well received by Stephanie Merritt of The Daily Telegraph who stated that \\"Miller has drawn an exquisite and convincing picture of 18th-century London\\" and complemented the novels \\"elegant prose\\", \\"luxurious imagery\\" and \\"wry humour\\". It was also relatively well reviewed by The Independent, who stated that \\"The only problem posed for the reader is whether to dwell on the sumptuous pleasures of Miller's intricate prose or to race along with the farcical complications of his plot.\\". The novel was well received by The New York Times, with reviewer Lorna Sage stating \\"Miller's Casanova, ingeniously translated to our own fin de si√®cle, is a New Age narcissist -- so observant, so chastened, that self-love can save him after all.\\"; and, while commenting on the implausibility of the novels premise, stating \\"that's precisely the confidence trick Miller is so good at, conjuring the phrases that get sensation onto the page, keeping you in obsessive, close-up focus\\". The novel was praised in the Seattle Times also, with reviewer Michael Upchurch praising the novels \\"extravagant humor\\" and \\"wealth of period detail\\", while stating \\"Miller, born in 1961, seems a mite too young to have passed this particular threshold of experience himself. But he sure gets it painfully and hilariously right.\\". The novel did not, however, receive universal acclaim. Elspeth Barker, also reviewing for The Independent, stated \\"this is a disappointing and unsatisfying book\\", calling Casanova himself a \\"two-dimensional creature, too shallow and self-absorbed to engage sympathy\\" and mentioning that \\"his actions and the actions of those around him often seem merely arbitrary\\" and stating \\"some of the prose is oddly awkward and laboured\\". She does, however temper this by stating \\"despite its flaws, at its best it confirms the unshakeable certainty which possesses anyone who has read Miller's marvellous Ingenious Pain: that here is a writer of very rare and outstanding gifts, no matter what.\\". In a review by Michael Arditti, again for The Independent, Arditti states \\"Casanova is a deeply disappointing second novel from the author of Ingenious Pain. There is no sense of personal impetus behind the writing, which offers a rehash of well-known images and themes.\\" and criticises the \\"basic plot\\", simple characters and lack of originality. He further states of Miller that he \\"hope[s] he gives more scope to his own proven powers of imagination in his next book.\\".

Biography Three years after his first queen consort‚Äôs death, Injo of Joseon chose a new consort to be crowned as his queen, who was the fourteen-year old Queen Jangryeol. Her relationship with Injo was not good due to the fact that she could not bear a son, thus she left the main palace at that time, Changdeok Palace, to live in Gyeongdeok Palace. After Injo‚Äôs death, she was elevated to the rank of a dowager and formally addressed as Queen Dowager Jaui. Disputes happened during the death of her stepson, Hyojong, and his wife, Queen Inseon, where the factions argued on the duration in which Queen Jangryeol would have to wear the mourning attire or sangbok. The incident was known as Yesong Dispute(ÏòàÏÜ°ÎÖºÏüÅ): for Hyojong of Joseon‚Äôs funeral, it became an issue to determine whether the dowager should be mourning for three or one year, while for Queen Inseon, either one year or nine months. Hyeonjong of Joseon became the king and Queen Jangryeol officially became the great royal queen dowager. Since she did not have any children, she led a solitary life until her death during Sukjong of Joseon‚Äôs reign after living 50 years of her life as a woman of the royal palace.
