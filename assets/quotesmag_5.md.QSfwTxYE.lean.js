History It was first proclaimed on 14 July 1864. A month later on 11 August, another proclamation rescinded the initial proclamation, due to an erroneous boundary definition, and provided a correct description of the district's boundaries. The district included a narrow strip of the Hundred of Yatala west of the Port Adelaide Creek and a small southwestern portion of the Hundred of Port Adelaide south of the Semaphore jetty and west of the Port Adelaide township. The modern suburb of Glanville is at the extreme north east of the historic district council area. Fort Glanville and Glanville Hall (of Glanville Hall Estate) in the modern suburbs of Semaphore Park and Semaphore South, respectively, were somewhat more central. Although debates were held over the years regarding construction of a permanent council chambers or hall, the council used chambers in the Thornton Hotel until its end. In 1881, councillors were elected from three wards: North Glanville, South Glanville, and Davenport. Much of the district and the adjacent District Council of Lefevre's Peninsula was severed on 20 December 1883 as the new Corporate Town of Semaphore. The new boundaries limited the viability of the council, and the Semaphore council debated as early as January 1884 whether the Glanville council had become defunct as a result of the changes. However, it remained in existence until 5 January 1888, when the remaining portions were merged into the District Council of Woodville as its Davenport Ward following their forced amalgamation by the District Councils Act 1887.

They arrived to a poor situation: the house was \\"ruinous\\"; there were problems with hiring domestic staff; supplies of household goods were limited and deliveries infrequent, and Waitangi itself was an isolated outpost. In fact, the house was in such a poor state that the Busbys moved out to stay with the missionary Henry Williams for several months while workers repaired it, returning in January 1834. In letters to his family at this time, Busby described his wife's life as \\"slavish\\": \\"I often think she is a little lonely here, although she never complains\\".Treaty House, the Busbys' residence at Waitangi As the wife of the British Resident, Agnes Busby's role was to entertain and provide hospitality for visiting dignitaries, ship's officers and local MƒÅori chiefs, and to help James write his despatches to the Colonial Office. The couple were also expected to be the leaders of what colonial society existed in the area at the time (about six families). To provide a level of hospitality befitting the representative of the British government despite the primitive circumstances was a constant challenge requiring much hard work; in a letter to her friend Charlotte Brown at the Tauranga Mission, Busby commented that \\"our domestic comfort depends so much on our own exertion\\". However, reports from contemporaries suggest that she managed well: a letter from Edward Markham, a visitor to Waitangi in 1834, recorded that Busby was \\"very pleasant\\" and the stay in her home \\"a glimpse of Civilisation\\". Caroline Mair, whose father Gilbert Mair was an early trader and settler in nearby Paihia, described Busby as \\"a very dignified and rather exclusive little Scotch lady, but kindly withal\\". Busby gave birth to four children while at Waitiangi: John (1834), Sarah (1835), James (1838), and George (1839). The first baby, John, was delivered by a visiting ship's surgeon, and Marianne Williams (trained maternity nurse and wife of the missionary Henry Williams). 36 hours after the birth, local MƒÅori attacked the house's store-room, and Williams described a scene of \\"great agitation\\" as James Busby was shot at and a piece of wood cut his face. After this incident, he tried to employ a MƒÅori guard but failed, and the family left for the safety of Australia for some months. Busby himself delivered Agnes' fourth baby, George, as the doctor was slow in arriving. Later life In 1839, the British government sent William Hobson to Waitangi to investigate the state of the settlement and relations between MƒÅori and Pakeha. As a result of changes to the British presence in New Zealand, the Busbys and their children departed for Sydney. They returned in 1841, farmed land in the Bay of Islands, and had two more children, William (1841) and Agnes (1842). James Busby died in 1871, during a trip to England for an eye operation. Following his death, Agnes returned to Waitangi and lived with a son and his family. She died at Pakaraka on 13 October 1889 and is buried in the churchyard at Paihia.

After Battle of Karbala, the captured family of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, and the heads of those killed were moved to the Levant by the forces of Yazid. By order of Yazid, a pulpit was prepared, and a public speaker gave a lecture that placed blame on Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. With the permission of Yazid, Ali ibn Husayn seized the opportunity to speak. He introduced himself and his descendants. Also, he recounted the events leading to the death of Husayn ibn Ali.  Ali ibn Husayn  Ali ibn Husayn (), also known as Zayn al-Abidin (, \\"Adornment of the Worshippers\\"), was the fourth Shia Imam, after his father Husayn. Ali ibn Husayn survived the Battle of Karbala and was taken, along with enslaved women, to the caliph in Damascus. Eventually, he was allowed to return to Medina, where he led a secluded life with a few intimate companions. Zayn al- Abidin's life and statements were entirely devoted to asceticism and religious teachings, mostly in the form of invocations and supplications. His famous supplications are known as Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya.  Background  After the Battle of Karbala, the captured family of the prophet Muhammad and the heads of those killed were moved to the Levant by the forces of Yazid. According to Turabi, on the first day of Safar they arrived in the Levant (Damascus) and were taken into Yazid's presence. According to Bihar al-Anwar, Yazid ordered a pulpit to be constructed in Damascus. He designated a public speaker to blame Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. The public speaker sat at the pulpit and began his lecture by praising Allah and insulting Ali and his son, Husayn. Also, he devoted a long time to praising Yazid and his father Muawiyah. In the middle of the lecture, Ali ibn Husayn called out to him and said: \\"O you who preach! Woe be to you! You have bought the wrath of the Creator in lieu of the pleasure of the creatures, while your place is hell.\\" Then he turned towards Yazid and said: \\"Do you permit me to speak that which would be agreeable to Allah and would be a means of reward for those present?\\" Yazid refused, but the people said, \\"Permit him to ascend the pulpit. Perhaps we may hear something (worthwhile) from him.\\" Yazid replied, \\"If I permit him to mount the pulpit, he shall not descend it until he humiliates me and the progeny of Abu Sufyan.\\" They said, \\"How could this ailing youth do such a thing?' Yazid replied, \\"He comes from a family that has from infancy consumed wisdom along with their milk.\\" Yazid finally relented, and Ali ibn Husayn ascended the pulpit and gave his sermon.(According to Kamile Bahai, Ali ibn Husayn asked Yazid to let him give the sermon on Friday.)  Context  Ali ibn Husayn began his sermon by praising Allah. Then he said about the knowledge, forbearance, munificence, eloquence, valor, and friendship of Ahl al-Bayt and also the name of Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Ja'far ibn Abi Talib. He drew attention to criteria that indicated the eligibility of Ahl al-Bayt for the succession of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. It was in this way that he introduced himself, saying that there was no need to introduce himself to people who knew him, but that he was introducing himself for those who did not know him. = The son of Mecca and Mina = Ali ibn Husayn introduced himself as son of Mecca and Mina. With these sentences, he stated that his ancestors reached back to Abraham, who had constructed the Kaaba. He added that it was important to remember that people who honor the Kaaba must revere Ali ibn Husayn as the son of Mecca. In other words, anyone who did not respect Ali ibn Husayn was, in fact, blaspheming all that was sacred. = The son of Muhammad = = The son of Ali = = The son of Fatimah bint Muhammad = = The son of who killed at battle of Karbala = = Call to pray = When Ali ibn Husayn said these statements, Yazid ordered the moazzin to call people for prayers. While the mu'azzin said: \\"I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\\", Ali ibn Husayn stated: Yazid knew that it was in his best interest not to answer, so he ordered the mu'azzin to continue.  Effect  After delivering the sermon, those in the audience began to cry. They gathered around Ali ibn Husayn to apologize.

History Everest cigarettes were launched in the 1960s and are popular in the Zimbabwean cigarette market. During the recording of Abbey Road, a 1969 album by The Beatles, audio engineer Geoff Emerick used to smoke Everests. The band liked the visual imagery of the packet and chose Everest as a working title for the album. The brand is mainly sold in Zimbabwe, but also was or still is sold in the United Kingdom, Belgium, The Netherlands, South Africa and Vietnam. Various advertising posters were also made. Abbey Road album name Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles and was released on 26 September 1969. Geoff Emerick, the band's audio engineer, used to smoke Everest cigarettes and hence the group had decided to name the album after the brand of cigarette and title it either Mount Everest, Everest or Ever Rest (since packets had a silhouette of Mount Everest on them and the Beatles liked the imagery). Originally the band intended to take a private plane over to the Himalayas to shoot a photograph of Mount Everest for the album cover. The group, however, did not want to undertake the long trip and travel to Mount Everest for the photo shoot. Paul McCartney drew a sketch with four little stick men crossing the zebra crossing on Abbey Road. The group liked the idea and McCartney suggested they just go outside, take the photo there and name the album after the street. On 8 August 1969, photographer Iain Macmillan took the iconic album cover photograph of the group walking on the zebra crossing outside the studio. Smuggling In 2009, contraband cigarettes worth 3.1 million US Dollars were intercepted in Botswana.

Divorce requests are assessed by the court, in accordance with the positive and negative prerequisites set in the relevant law.http://logika.uwb.edu.pl/studies/download.php?volid=45&artid;=dm Law In order for a divorce to be granted there is a need of the satisfaction of the positive prerequisite (the presence of the ground for divorce) and of the negative prerequisite (the absence of conditions which prohibit the granting of the divorce).http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/Poland-Divorce.pdf Current divorce in Poland is regulated by Polish law divorce is regulated by the statute of February 25, 1964: The Polish Family and Guardianship Code, which came into force on January 1, 1965. The statute is divided into three parts (titles), the first of which concerns matrimonial matters of marriage.https://www.international-divorce.com/d-poland.htm The law also updated in 1999 to include legal separation. Grounds for divorce There is one single ground of divorce, namely \\"the irretrievable and complete disintegration of matrimonial life\\" (Article 56 (1) of the Polish Family and Guardianship Code). Usually, a lack of any spiritual, physical and economic bonds between the spouses is necessary in order to prove the ground of divorce, although the Supreme Court has ruled that part of the economic bond may still remain (for example if the spouses live in the same home, although their matrimonial life is otherwise disintegrated). The existence of the ground for divorce is essential - if it is not proven, then the divorce cannot be granted. The negative prerequisites If the ground above is proven, the court assesses ex-officio (of its own motion) whether there are any of the conditions which prohibit the granting of the divorce. If any of them are present, the divorce cannot be granted, even if the ground for divorce has been proven. The negative prerequisites are (Articles 56 (2) and 56 (3) of Polish Family and Guardianship Code): *the divorce would be detrimental to the welfare of the common minor children of the spouses *the divorce would be contrary to the principles of social norms *the divorce is requested by the spouse who is solely guilty for the disintegration of matrimonial life, unless **the other spouse consents to the divorce, or **the refusal of the other spouse to consent to the divorce is contrary to social norms (e.g. is done only due to revenge) Fault The divorce law is fault-based. The court rules ex-officio on who is at fault for the divorce, unless the spouses request otherwise. The court may rule that one spouse is guilty, that both spouses are guilty, or that neither spouse is guilty. Being solely at fault has two ramifications: firstly, the sole guilty party cannot be granted a divorce without the consent of the innocent spouse (unless the innocent spouse withholds consent for reasons contrary to social norms); and secondly, the guilty party can be ordered to pay alimony (Article 57 (1) and 57 (2) of the Polish Family and Guardianship Code). Length of Divorce Process Regional courts in Poland usually can take one to two years to complete the divorce process after a divorce petition is filed.https://www.radcaprawny.info/en/divorce-in-poland/ References Category:Divorce by country Category:Polish law ","title":"Divorce in Poland"},{"id":"48412750","text":"PELbO (initiated 2006 in Trondheim) is a Norwegian electronica/jazz trio.

Directed by N. A. Ansari, the film stars Pradeep Kumar, Tanuja, and Johnny Walker. One of the earliest sci-fi films made in India, it tells the story of a supposed martial threat on India by aliens from outer space intending to rob the rich of their diamonds. Made on a low budget, the film was promoted with the tagline \\"The strange visitors from Mars are on the way\\". Plot Agent Rakesh is assigned by Chief Sheikh of the Central Intelligence Service to investigate the murder case of Dinanath from Karolbagh, with speculation of a possible involvement of aliens from Mars. Rakesh, who lives with his mother and is to marry Anita, embarks on a journey to Bombay along with private detective Neelkanth, from Blue Bird Detective Agency.

Being one of the only sci-fi pictures from India, the film has been discussed by a number of scholars. According to Sami Ahmad Khan, author of the essay Bollywood's Encounters with the Third Kind, Wahan Ke Log seems to have taken inspiration from the Sino-Indian War which took place five years before, even though no mention of China is made in the film. The Times of India listed the film as one of India's \\"Super C grade movies\\", dismissing it as the worst of India's sci-fi films. A retrospective review by The Hindu, however, called it \\"an unusual film, an interesting blend of a ghost and thieving aliens\\".

European settlement relied heavily on convicts, sent to Australia as punishment for crimes and forced into labour and often sold to free settlers. Many Indigenous Australians were also forced into various forms of slavery and unfree labour from colonisation and this persisted for some Indigenous Australians until the 1970s. Labourers were also imported from the Pacific Islands, India and China; and employed in various degrees of slavery and unfree labour. Chattel slavery, where people are treated as personal property of their owners, existed in practicehttps://theconversation.com/was- there-slavery-in-australia-yes-it-shouldnt-even-be-up-for-debate-140544 despite laws against it. The most extreme instances include the blackbirding of Pacific Islanders, who were kidnapped or recruited often through coercion from their home islands and forced to work in Queensland. Legal protections varied and were sometimes not enforced, particularly with workers who were effectively forced to work for their employers and would often go unpaid. Australia was held to the Slave Trade Act 1807 as well as the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in the British Empire. Types of slavery =Convicts= Many of the convicts transported to the Australian penal colonies were treated as slave labour. William Hill, an officer aboard the Second Fleet, wrote that \\"the slave traffic is merciful compared with what I have seen in this fleet [...] the more they can withhold from the unhappy wretches, the more provisions they have to dispose of at a foreign market, and the earlier in the voyage they die, the longer they can draw the deceased's allowance to themselves\\". Once the convicts arrived in Australia they were subjected to the system of \\"assigned service\\", whereby they were leased out to private citizens and placed entirely under their control, often forced to work in chain gangs. The unwillingness of wealthy landowners to give up this cheap source of labour was a key factor in why penal transportation persisted for so long, especially in Van Diemen's Land where \\"assigned service\\" continued to be widespread until the 1850s.Convict slavery in Australia =Coolies= With the ceasing of convict transportation to New South Wales becoming imminent by the late 1830s, colonists required a substitute cheap form of labour. In 1837 a Committee on Immigration identified the possibility of importing coolie labourers from India and China as a solution. John Mackay, an owner of indigo plantations in Bengal and a distillery in Sydney, organised the import of 42 coolies from India who arrived on 24 December 1837 on board Peter Proctor. This was the first sizeable transport of coolie labour into Australia and Mackay leased most of them out as shepherds to work at John Lord's Underbank land-holding just north of Dungog. The contracts included a 5 or 6 year term of indenture with food, clothing, pay and shelter to be provided, but many absconded, due to reasons of these conditions not being met. The coolies were also subject to assault, slavery, and kidnap. Government enquiries delayed further coolie importation, but in 1842 a number of colonists, including William Wentworth and Gordon Sandeman, formed an Association to Import Coolies to pressure the colonial government into allowing further intakes. The following year, Major G.F. Davidson imported 30 Indian coolies into Melbourne, and in 1844 Sandeman and Phillip Freil organised a shipment of 30 Indian coolies, most of whom were sent to work on their properties in the Lockyer Valley. Wentworth and Robert Towns arranged a shipment of 56 Indian coolies who arrived in a state of starvation in 1846. These coolies went either to labour on Wentworth's pastoral properties such as Burburgate on the Namoi River or worked as servants at his Vaucluse House mansion. Some were leased out to Helenus Scott's Glendon property in the Hunter Valley. Many of these coolies were subject to beatings, were left unpaid, unfed or unclothed, and some died of exposure or by attacks. Those who protested their condition as breach of contract were often imprisoned. Indian coolie transportation was largely discontinued after this but the first shipment of 150 Chinese coolies arrived in Melbourne in 1847 aboard the brig Adelaide and another 31 arrived in Perth a year later. Toward the end of 1848, Nimrod and Phillip Laing brought a further 420 mostly Chinese coolies into the Port Phillip District. Many of these coolies were abandoned, perished in the bush, were jailed, or were found wandering the streets of Melbourne with no food or shelter. Around another 1500 Chinese coolies were shipped into Australia up to the year 1854 with Robert Towns and Gordon Sandeman again being the principal organisers of the trade. A number of scandals occurred that caused a government select committee to be formed to investigate the importation of Asiatic labour. The inquiry found that 70 coolies had died aboard General Palmer during the voyage from Amoy to Sydney and that others had died from sickness once in Australia. There were no berths, bedding, medical, or toilet facilities available on the vessel and a great deal of kidnapping was involved in the recruitment process. The poor conditions on board the vessel Spartan, chartered by Robert Towns, sparked a rebellion of coolies against the crew of the ship. The second-mate and ten of the Chinese were killed before the captain was able to regain control. Out of nearly 250 coolies who had embarked on Spartan, only 180 arrived in Australia. These events together with concurrent disasters in the Chinese coolie trade to Cuba and Peru, ended Asian coolie transportation to Australia by 1855. From 1858, Chinese migration to Australia again spiked due to the gold rushes, but this was mostly voluntary travel. =Indigenous labour= From the early stages of British colonisation of Australia right up until the 1960s, Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders were used as unpaid labour in many sectors such as the pastoralist industry, beche-de- mer harvesting, pearling, the boiling down industry, marsupial eradication, and prostitution, they were also used as household servants. In return for this labour, the Indigenous people were given portions of inexpensive commodities such as tobacco, rum, slop-clothing, flour and offal. Trade in Aboriginal children and adolescents was often sought after. Children were often taken from Aboriginal camp-sites after punitive expeditions and they were used as either personal servants or as labour by the colonists who took them. Sometimes these children were taken very far away from their lands and traded to other colonists. For instance, Mary Durack described how one of her relatives in the Kimberley region bought an Aboriginal boy from Queensland for a tin of jam. In the pastoralist sector, unpaid labour also allowed Aboriginal people to stay on their land instead of being forced off or massacred. Even in cases after Federation in 1901, where Aboriginal labour was legislated as requiring payment in money, these wages were often kept in bank accounts that could not be accessed by them, with the money being redirected elsewhere by government bureaucracies. In the 1960s, famous protests against these working conditions such as the Wave Hill walk-off, brought international awareness to the issue. Although changes were made, modernisation and automisation of the pastoralist industry around the same time allowed the leaseholders to remove Aboriginal people from the land, often dumping them in townships with minimal facilities. =Blackbirding= The first shipload of 65 Melanesian labourers arrived in Boyd Town on 16 April 1847 on board the Velocity, a vessel under the command of Captain Kirsopp and chartered by Benjamin Boyd. Boyd was a Scottish colonist who wanted cheap labourers to work at his expansive pastoral leaseholds in the colony of New South Wales. He financed two more procurements of South Sea Islanders, 70 of which arrived in Sydney in September 1847, and another 57 in October of that same year. Many of these Islanders soon absconded from their workplaces and were observed starving and destitute on the streets of Sydney. Reports of violence, kidnap and murder used during the recruitment of these labourers surfaced in 1848 with a closed-door enquiry choosing not to take any action against Boyd or Kirsopp. The experiment of exploiting Melanesian labour was discontinued in Australia until Robert Towns recommenced the practice in the early 1860s. In 1863, Robert Towns wanted to profit from the world-wide cotton shortage due to the American Civil War. He bought a property he named Townsvale on the Logan River and planted 400 acres of cotton. Towns also wanted cheap labour to harvest and prepare the cotton and decided to import Melanesian labour from the Loyalty Islands and the New Hebrides. Captain Grueber together with labour recruiter Ross Lewin aboard the Don Juan, brought 73 South Sea Islanders to the port of Brisbane in August 1863. Towns specifically wanted adolescent males recruited and kidnapping was reportedly employed in obtaining these boys. Over the following two years, Towns imported around 400 more Melanesians to Townsvale on one to three year terms of labour. They came on the vessels Uncle Tom (Captain Archer Smith) and Black Dog (Captain Linklater). In 1865, Towns obtained large land leases in Far North Queensland and funded the establishment of the port of Townsville. He organised the first importation of South Sea Islander labour to that port in 1866. They came aboard Blue Bell under Captain Edwards. Apart from a small amount of Melanesian labour imported for the beche-de-mer trade around Bowen, Robert Towns was the primary exploiter of blackbirded labour up til 1867. From 1867, the high demand for very cheap labour in the sugar and pastoral industries of Queensland, resulted in a massive increase in blackbirding in the region. Over a nearly forty year period, traders \\"recruited\\" Melanesian or Kanaka labourers for the sugar cane fields of Queensland, from the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Loyalty Islands of New Caledonia as well as Niue. From 1868, the Queensland government tried to regulate the trade: it required every ship engaged in recruiting labourers from the Pacific islands to carry a person approved by the government to ensure that labourers were willingly recruited and not kidnapped. But, such government observers were often corrupted by bonuses paid for labourers 'recruited,' or blinded by alcohol, and did little or nothing to prevent sea-captains from tricking islanders on-board or otherwise engaging in kidnapping with violence. Joe Melvin, an investigative journalist who, undercover, in 1892 joined the crew of Queensland blackbirding ship Helena, found no instances of intimidation or misrepresentation and concluded that the Islanders recruited did so \\"willingly and cannily\\".Peter Corris, 'Melvin, Joseph Dalgarno (1852‚Äì1909)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/melvin-joseph-dalgarno-7556/text13185, published first in hardcopy 1986, accessed online 9 January 2015. The generally coercive recruitment was similar to the press-gangs once employed by the Royal Navy in England. Some 55,000 to 62,500 South Sea Islanders were taken to Australia.Tracey Flanagan, Meredith Wilkie, and Susanna Iuliano. \\"Australian South Sea Islanders: A Century of Race Discrimination under Australian Law\\", Australian Human Rights Commission. These people were referred to as Kanakas (the French equivalent Canaques is still used to refer to the ethnic Melanesians in New Caledonia) and came from the Western Pacific islands: from Melanesia, mainly the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides, with a small number from the Polynesian and Micronesian islands such as Tonga (mainly 'Ata), Samoa, Kiribati, Tuvalu, and Loyalty Islands. Many of the workers were effectively slaves, but they were officially called \\"indentured labourers\\" or the like. Some Australian Aboriginal people, especially from Cape York Peninsula, were also kidnapped and transported south to work on the farms. The methods of blackbirding were varied. Some labourers were willing to be taken to Australia to work, while others were tricked or forced. In some cases blackbirding ships (which made huge profits) would entice entire villages by luring them on board for trade or a religious service, and then setting sail. Many died in the fields due to the hard manual labour. The question of how many Islanders were kidnapped or \\"blackbirded\\" is unknown and remains controversial. Official documents and accounts from the period often conflict with the oral tradition passed down by the descendants of workers. Stories of blatantly violent kidnapping tended to relate to the first 10‚Äì15 years of the trade. The majority of the 10,000 Pacific Islanders remaining in Australia in 1901 were repatriated from 1906‚Äì08 under the provisions of the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901. A 1992 census of South Sea Islanders reported around 10,000 descendants of the blackbirded labourers living in Queensland. Fewer than 3,500 were reported in the 2001 Australian census. =Pearling= Indigenous Australians, Malaysians, Timorese, and Micronesians were kidnapped and sold as slave-labour for the pearling industry of north western Australia. =Modern Slavery= According to the Global Slavery Index, there were approximately 15,000 people living in illegal \\"conditions of modern slavery\\" in Australia in 2016. During the 2015‚Äì16 financial year, 169 alleged human trafficking and slavery offences were referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP), including alleged instances of forced marriage, sexual exploitation, and forced labour. As of 2017, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions had prosecuted 19 individuals for slavery-related offences since 2004, with several other prosecutions ongoing. Legislation and anti- slavery campaigning Anti-slavery campaigners described the conditions of Aboriginal labour in northern Australia as slavery as far back as the 1860s. In 1891 the British journal Anti-Slavery Reporter published a ‚ÄúSlave Map of Modern Australia‚Äù. (Primary citation needed) There was legislation which allowed slavery of Aboriginal people to continue in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. The Aborigines Act 1911 gave South Australian police powers to ‚Äúinspect workers and their conditions‚Äù but not to enforce change; the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 (Cth) allowed the non-payment of wages and forced recruitment of labour in the Northern Territory; and in Queensland, the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 and successive legislation allowed the Protector of Aborigines to keep wages in funds which were never paid out. Northern Territory Protector Cecil Cook noted that Australia was in breach of its obligations under the League of Nations Slavery Convention in the 1930s. Through the 20th century, the British Commonwealth League, the North Australian Workers‚Äô Union, anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt, artist Albert Namatjira and others raised concerns about the slave-like conditions under which many Aboriginal people worked. In 2019, a class action on behalf of 10,000 Aboriginal Queenslanders was settled against the Queensland Government, with a payout of . The lawsuit claimed that the legislation in force from 1939 to 1972 allowed the wages of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers to be stolen.  The \\"History Wars\\"  The assertion that slavery took place in Australia in colonial times is often disputed, as part of the ongoing \\"history wars\\" about Australia's past. In June 2020 the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, stated on 2GB radio in Sydney that ‚ÄúAustralia when it was founded as a settlement, as New South Wales, was on the basis that there be no slavery...and while slave ships continued to travel around the world, when Australia was established, yes sure, it was a pretty brutal settlement‚Ä¶ but there was no slavery in Australia‚Äù. After attracting reproach by aboriginal activists and other sectors of the community, Morrison apologised for any offence caused the following day, and said that he was talking specifically about the colony of New South Wales. Colonisation funded by slavery elsewhere In the nineteenth century there were also many beneficiaries of slavery practised overseas who came to the Australian colonies or who financed settlement of the colonies. Historians have shown that the wealth made from slavery helped finance the colonisation of Australia.Catherine Hall, ‚ÄúWriting History, Making ‚ÄòRace‚Äô\\" (2016), https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1031461X.2016.1202291 (paywall); Humphrey McQueen, ‚ÄúBorn Free: Wage-slaves and chattel-slaves‚Äù (2018), http://honesthistory.net.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/1482-Born-Free-South- Australia.pdf; CJ Coventry, \\"Links in the Chain: British slavery, Victoria and South Australia,\\" Before Now (2019) https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:23671/ References Further reading * Podcast  Article about a documentary film.

Like his wife the former Jean Van Nest, whom he married in 1893, Foster could trace his family back to the early settlers of New York. Other sources show Foster's family arriving in the United States more recently, from Scotland, in the 1800s. The couple had one child, a son, also named Giraud, but always known as \\"Boy\\", born in 1904. For the greater part of his long life, Foster resided at Bellefontaine, the classical 18th century-style mansion which he and his wife built, as a holiday 'cottage', between 1896 and 1898, at Lenox, Massachusetts. During the Fosters' tenure, Bellefontaine became known as one of the great mansions of the gilded age. Designed by the eminent New York architectural firm of Carrere and Hastings, the house was built around an inner courtyard in a simple classic style; its principal facade dominated by a large portico. The design is reputed to be based on that of Ange-Jacques Gabriel's Petit Trianon at Versailles. While there are similarities between the two buildings, the dominating portico with a low upper floor above it, more closely resembles Gabriel's Pavilion de Louveciennes, while the rear facade shares many architectural similarities with the Chateau de Voisins also at Louveciennes. While the Fosters spent their summers at Bellefontaine, they also had a winter home, Orange Grove, Aiken County, South Carolina. Jean Foster died there in 1932 and Foster sold the house three years later. The Fosters were socially eminent public figures and entertained on a large scale. Foster was a member of the Knickerbocker Club and President of the Mahkeenac Boat Club and Canada's Restigouche Salmon Fishing Club. He was also a devout Christian and warden of Lenox's Trinity Episcopal Church. Foster died at Bellefontaine in 1945 leaving an estate valued at $527,551.65. The house was sold, in 1947, together with all its furnishings and 182 acres of land for $80,000. Shortly afterwards a fire gutted its interiors. The interior was rebuilt but not to anywhere near its elegant days of yore. After that, Bellefontaine was again sold to the Sacred Heart Priests and Brothers. The building was used as a minor seminary for boys interested in the priesthood. It was named Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary. The S.C.J.s built a new attached wing which housed classrooms, rev rooms, a gymnasium, refectory, and a chapel. It was used as a seminary from 1961 until its close in 1978. It was sold to another developer but nothing was done to the beautiful residence. Again it was sold in the early 80s. The new owners demolished the newer buildings and also restored the beautiful sunken garden that Giraud had loved so much. The exterior of the building was restored and the interior was again rebuilt to suit the many clients of Canyon Ranch, which is an elite health spa.

How it works  Data is gathered from in excess of 18,000 AIS equipped volunteer contributors in over 140 countries around the world. Information provided by AIS equipment, such as unique identification, position, course, and speed is then transferred to the main Marine Traffic servers for display via the website in real time. The site uses Google Maps as its base mapping.  History  MarineTraffic was originally developed as an academic project at the University of the Aegean in Ermoupoli, Greece. In late 2007, Professor Dimitris Lekkas published it as a trial version.  Community  MarineTraffic is highly dependent from its community of radio amateurs or AIS Station owner, its photographers and translators.

Rabobank focuses on rural banking, business banking and saving services. The New Zealand subsidiary was registered in 1994. History In 1998, Rabobank purchased the finance company Wrightson Farmers Finance Limited from Wrightson, a 160-year-old farming business, for . The sale destabilised Wrighton, but effectively established Rabobank as a rural lender in New Zealand. From November 2008 until December 2012, Rabobank was the principal sponsor of BikeNZ (since renamed to Cycling New Zealand). =Credit rating= Rabobank New Zealand historically had the highest-possible credit rating of AAA from Standard & Poor's. However, after its parent company Rabobank Nederland had its rating downgraded and the deposit guarantee that the parent provided to the New Zealand subsidiary expired, S&P; downgraded Rabobank's credit rating to A. Rabobank stated that deposits in Rabobank and RaboDirect made before the expiry of the parental guarantee in 2015 will still be guaranteed as long until they are withdrawn or transferred to another account. The credit rating of Rabobank New Zealand as of October 2015 is A from Standard & Poor's. RaboDirect RaboDirect a division of Rabobank New Zealand specialising in online savings and investments. It runs under the slogan \\"Your specialist savings bank\\". RaboDirect offers online savings accounts and access to investment funds. Cash deposits through RaboDirect are used for lending to the New Zealand rural sector through Rabobank New Zealand. RaboDirect, originally known as RaboPlus, was launched in February 2006. The bank originally advertised to customers as \\"Your significant other bank\\". By August 2006, six months after its launch, it had gathered over $500 million in deposits. In July 2010 the bank was rebranded as RaboDirect to bring it in line with other countries where Rabodirect operated such services. Criticism In March 2013 a Taranaki dairy farming family were forced off their ≈åkato farm after Rabobank refused to negotiate a deal to refinance their mortgage with another bank and repossessed the farm. http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/8616646/Okato-dairy-farm-seized-after- threats-bank The family were initially given 21 days to come up with a resolution but 2 weeks earlier than this forced off the farm after the farm threatened to damage farm assets. The repossession resulted in bobby calves that were owned by the son of the family being killed by the receivers as well as some stock slaughtered. A journalist, Melanie Reid, from the TV3 show 3rd Degree was assaulted along with the cameraman when questioning the receivers on the receivership. http://www.newshub.co.nz/tvshows/3d/gray-family-and- receivers-clash-over-farm-2013050115#axzz45hUu3VGk There were also disputes over part of the farm being gifted to the family by local Maori on the condition the farm stay with the family.

The hotel was founded in 1877 as the \\"Hotel Waldhaus\\" at a time when the tourism potential of the Swiss Alps was leading to rapid growth in the sector. In 2008, following a major building programme, the Hotel Waldhaus was rebranded as the \\"Waldhaus Flims Mountain Resort & Spa\\". In 2015 the business was forced by heavy indebtedness into bankruptcy and 900 shareholders lost their investment, although confidence was expressed that following financial restructuring, likely to include the sale to second home-buyers of holiday apartments included in what had by this time become a major hotel complex, the hotel would survive. The Waldhaus offers 333 beds in 150 guest rooms, 16 seminar/banquet/conference rooms and 6 restaurants, distributed across several buildings. There are three main buildings. The \\"Grand Hotel Waldhaus\\" building is a grand hotel, its architecture resonant of the confidence engendered by rapid economic expansion during the later nineteenth century, in a style described as \\"classical feudal\\" (\\"klassisch- feudal\\"). The other principal buildings are the \\"rustic Grand Chalet Belmont\\" and the \\"Villa Silvana\\", in effect another small luxury hotel built in a \\"summer house\\" style.Unfortunately the Waldhaus no longer features on the \\"Small Luxury Hotels of the World\\" website from which these descriptions translated from the German Wikipedia entry on the Waldhaus, appear to have been taken. This may reflect the current (2015) financial difficulties of the Waldhaus. There is also a \\"Jugendstil (Art nouveau)\\" pavilion with a conference room, restaurants and bars. The Waldhaus complex is today the largest \\"hotel park\\" in Switzerland, with a total foot-print of 200,000 square meters, and around 24 separate buildings. History =Origins= The origins of the Waldhaus go back to the foundation in 1869 of the \\"Waldhaus- Flims cure and lake-bathing establishment\\" (\\"Kur- und Seebadanstalt Waldhaus Flims\\"). Two businessmen from Chur, Peter-Jakob Bener-Caviezel and Paul Lorenz obtained a concession to build a spa centre. 60 shares, each of 5,000 Swiss francs, were offered for subscription, which was underwritten with a guarantee from the municipality. The company was also guaranteed exclusive use of the Caumasee (lake), and provided with a large undeveloped knoll, covered with larch woods and pasture, located beyond the foresters' huts on the edge of the village, for a price of 50 Rappen (half a Swiss Franc) per square meter. By 1875 all the shares had been subscribed and building began. A 120-bed hotel was built under the direction of a St.Gallen architectural firm called \\"Lorenz\\". The project also included construction of a sawmill, a post office with stable and refreshment facilities for horses and postmen, a laundry, a cow stall, a water supply from the Prausura Spring and a small bathing station by the lake. The Spa Hotel (\\"Kurhaus\\") was opened in 1877, with a fresh running water supply in the kitchen. The entire site was criss-crossed by a network of walking trails which connected the nearby Tuffstein Spring and the \\"natural garden\\" (Rondell), or leading behind the Hotel Segnes to a viewing point taking in the rock cliffs. Many of these walking trails would later be destroyed to make way for further building development. Areas of the parkland, which had formerly been pasture, became forested now that they were no longer grazed. The new facility was placed under the direction of Johann Guggenb√ºhl, a hotel professional who had till that point been in charge of the Z√ºrcherhof (hotel) in Z√ºrich.Anliker: Schweizer Heimatb√ºcher, Flims; Bern 1961 =Boom years= Business was good. In 1881 the \\"Villa Belmont\\" was built as an overspill annex for the main hotel,http://swiss-historic- hotels.ch/en/hotels/flims_waldhaus.php which increased the total number of beds from 120 to 200. A spa doctor was recruited and the franchisee managing the cow stalls was encouraged to add ducks and chickens to his livestock operation. Subsequently, a pig house, a horse stable and a new cow house with its own onsite dairy were added. The clientele was international: Russian, French, British, American, Austrian and Dutch guests often stayed in the spa hotel for several months at a time. Swiss guests generally stayed for only a few weeks. The island in the middle of the Caumasee (lake) was purchased in 1884. In response to growth in demand for \\"luxury rooms\\", the \\"Villa Silvana\\" was built, opening in 1889. That was also the year in which an onsite generating station was constructed and the hotel gained an electricity supply, delivering what was described at the time as 60 \\"horsepower\\", which made it the largest private power station in the canton. At the same time the room rate was increased from 6.50 to 7.00 Swiss francs. The Waldhaus lost its first director in 1892 when Johann Guggenb√ºhl died following a short illness. He was succeeded by his wife, who ran the business with her two daughters. The Company Secretary, Joseph Zahnder, was permitted only to undertake the \\"greeting and valediction\\" duties with the guests. For the stay in 1893 of the child Dutch Queen Wilhelmina with the Regent-Queen Mother, a room in the recently completed Villa Silvana had its walls lined with pine timber, and new furniture delivered. Secretary Zahnder got his turn at the top job in 1893 when Guggenb√ºhl's widow also died. The hotel was now directed by Joseph Zahnder with the two Guggenb√ºhl daughters. In 1894 a new bakehouse was constructed along with a new timber fueled heating stove. Twenty-first century developments were adumbrated with the creation of a what was in effect a \\"fitness centre\\" (the Freiluftbad) which incorporated a range of sports facilities and equipment, separated between those for women and those for men. Instead of the conventional \\"Table d‚Äôh√¥te\\" catering arrangements, guests were now able to pay extra and be served their personal choice of dishes at individual tables. In 1895 traditional toilet facilities were replaced with modern wcs, which necessitated the construction of a reservoir. Just a year later all three of the hotel blocks were equipped with piped hot water and baths. =Twentieth century expansion= In 1900 the adjacent \\"Curhaus Segnes\\" spa hotel (today the \\"Restaurant Pomodoro\\") was acquired. Continued growth of the Waldhaus hotel complex was overseen by the Walthers, the couple who were now directing the business. In 1901 the hotel received its first tennis court and its own telephone, placed in a purpose built \\"kiosk\\" which was located a safe distance from the main buildings because there were fears of damage from a \\"short circuit\\". When, later in the century, the car park was extended the telephone kiosk was relocated to the lakeside. Its subsequent fate and present location are unknown, however. In 1904 the Jugendstil (Art nouveau) \\"casino\\" was built as an entertainment venue. All the buildings were now connected to one another with covered walkways (replaced in the 1970s by tunnels which provide more convincing weather protection). By 1904 the spa complex offered more than 437 guest beds, and the enterprise was backed by 1.1 Million Swiss francs of share capital. The room rate was raised to 8.00 francs. The next year Eduard and Clara Bezzola, whose Romansch family name hints at their provenance on the other side of the canton took over at the Waldhaus from the Walthers. In 1908 the former \\"Post Hotel\\" was integrated into the complex and renamed as the \\"Bellavista\\" (today the \\"China Restaurant\\"). By 1910 the telephone had survived for ten years in its kiosk without inflicting damage, and the telephone connection was therefore extended to the main hotel building. At this stage some of the rooms also received \\"en suite\\" bath facilities. Share of the AG Kurhotels und Seebad Waldhaus-Flims, issued 30. September 1929 Topography has kept the railway away from Flims, but the hotel received its first summer season Postbus service in 1920. The open topped charabanc, known as the \\"Car Alpin\\", greatly improved guest access. For winter season work a Postbus equipped with Caterpillar tracks (US-English: Continuous track) was introduced in 1926. Within the hotel complex, additional \\"en suite\\" bath facilities and running water installations were added during the 1920s. In 1923, after nearly half a century as the \\"Kur- und Seebadanstalt\\", the operating company changed its name to \\"AG Kurhotels und Seebad\\", while the hotel complex was now called \\"Park Hotels Waldhaus\\". Some of the canton's conservative elements bitterly resisted the lifting of the ban on motor cars, grudgingly enacted in the mid 1920s. Nevertheless, by the time the Waldhaus celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1927 car use was no longer restricted to doctors and ambulance drivers: many guests were arriving in private cars. In the dining room, \\"Table d‚Äôh√¥te\\" menues were abandoned. Switzerland received large numbers of political and economic migrants from Italy during the 1920s and 1930s, and at the Waldhaus Italian waiters replaced the locally recruited serving maids \\"Saalt√∂chter\\" who had hitherto served the meals. Roman Bezzola was appointed a director of the hotel, although Eduard and Clara Bezzola remained in charge, as \\"General Directors\\", till 1943. Bookings plunged in 1936 to the lowest level since 1915 due to fears triggered by a Polio epidemic that hit several Swiss cantons, including Graub√ºnden, during the summer months. The opportunity was taken to set out a new nine-hole golf course, although this only remained operational till 1941. Roman and Elsa Bezzola took over in 1943. Switzerland was badly impacted by the war that had broken out in surrounding countries in 1939: international tourists and food imports disappeared. Open areas in the hotel grounds were given over to the cultivation of vegetables, wheat and potatoes. A chicken and duck breeding programme was set up. Military uniforms were seen in the hotel and military officers who appeared to fill the otherwise empty hotel complex were welcome guests. After 70 years focused on summer business, in 1947, following extensive renovations, the Waldhaus opened for its first full winter season. The decision was driven by the opening a couple of years earlier of the Flims Cable car and the first Foppa-Naruas chairlift up the mountainside, both from a base-station beside the Waldhaus complex. In 1948 the Waldhaus for the first time also opened for the off-peak \\"shoulder seasons\\" before and after the main winter season. In the same year the former general director Eduard Bezzola died, following a long illness. During the 1950s the former Kurhaus hotel developed as a less formal holiday-sport hotel, with mid-day buffet lunches and an increased focus on special celebrations in the \\"Tschaler\\" dance-bar, which also provided an important operating base for a growing number of ski instructors. With improved roads and transport links there was an increase in short-stay overnight and weekend break visitors. Following a succession of developments and redevelopments of kitchen, dining and dancing facilities, and of the cellar space, 1962 brought a more substantial rebuilding project when a wing was added to the Hotel Segnes, which now provided 120 beds. At the same time the main hotel building received a new entrance hall and a new dining room extension. In June 1967 a covered swimming pool was added and a new Curling facility was installed. In 1969 the Caumasee (lake), together with its bathing and other recreational facilities, was sold back to the municipality. The period was one of further growth, with revenues increasing by 10% each year. (The Swiss annual inflation rate averaged only 2.52% between 1956 and 2015, despite briefly rising above 5% in the late 1960s.) Shareholders were receiving dividends equivalent to 9% of the par value of their shares. =Modern times= In 1970 the Hotel Bellavista was converted to a Hotel Garni (bed and breakfast hotel). A year later the 1904 Jugendstil (Art nouveau) pavilion was restored. In 1972 the individual buildings were connected to each other with tunnels. For children and their parents the hotel created its own Kindergarten facility. In 1975, after a 40-year term as general director, Roman Bezzola was succeeded in the top job by Hugo Nussli-Bezzola and his wife. An organisational restructuring saw the post of general director abolished, and a new director, named Riet Frey, took over while the former general director, Hugo Nussli, remained a board member. An underground parking garage was added only in 1981, together with two apartment blocks called, \\"Runca\\" and \\"Miramunt\\". Buyers of the holiday apartments received entitlement to use of the hotel facilities. The sale profits from the holiday apartments were used to fund a redesign and renovation for the Hotel Belmont, which was reopened in 1984, which was the year in which gross income exceeded 10 Million francs for the first time. Direction of the hotel was taken over by Josef and Marianne M√ºller. By 1988 the Hotel Segnes was no longer operating as a hotel, and it was converted into a restaurant, the \\"Pomodoro\\", while its guest rooms were reassigned fas staff accommodation. The former Hotel Bellavista later went the same way, becoming a Chinese restaurant. In 1990 the company name was changed from \\"AG Kurhotels Flims-Waldhaus\\" to \\"Park Hotels Waldhaus AG\\". =Museum= A museum celebrating the hotel's Belle √âpoque was created in 1992 in the cellar underneath the Casino-Pavilion. Numerous old fixtures were retrieved from their storage locations and used to document the history of the Waldhaus, which by now tracked back more than a century. After the exhibition commemorating the local architect Rudolf Olgiati opened in 1996, the crystal collection of the geologist Paul Membrini went on display in what had been the pavilion's white wine cellar. =New century: new beginnings= After nearly twenty years in charge, Josef and Marianne M√ºller left in 2000. Their successors, Christoph and Sabina Schlosser, stayed only till 2010 which was when directorship of the resort complex was taken on by Yasmin and Urs Grimm Cachemaille. Extensive building took place between 2003 and 2005: the Villa Silvana was extensively renovated. The 1967 indoor swimming pool was torn down, and its function taken over by a new glass coated Swimming and Wellness Canter. The architects were Hans Peter Fontana from Flims and Pia Schmid from Z√ºrich. The pavilion's old terrace was recreated, along with the Jugendstil (Art nouveau) features of the entrance lobby and reception area. On the site of the old laundry another holiday apartment block, \\"Wald Park\\", was built. Two more blocks, named \\"Ententeich\\" and \\"La Cauma\\", were added in 2005 and 2007. In 2009 the larches were removed from the original \\"Rondell\\" park, north of the Hotel Segnes, in order to make way for a large \\"Promenda\\" area. =Media exposure= In 2004 national television used the Waldhaus for a six- part mini-series, which presented \\"every day life in a five star hotel\\" in a docu-drama format. A television gala presentation was transmitted from the hotel in August 2006. Later that year part of a Parliamentary session was held in the Waldhaus. =Financing= 2006 was also the year in which the substantial shareholding accumulated by the Bezzola in the Hotel complex was sold, to be taken over by Hans Rudolf Wyss. The shareholding changes were accompanied by a further name change, from \\"Park Hotels Waldhaus AG\\" to \\"Waldhaus Flims Mountain Resort AG\\". On 7 April 2015 the company was declared bankrupt, with a funding shortfall initially reported at 30 Million francs. The running of the hotel was contracted by the receivers to a management company called \\"WF Hotel Management GmbH\\": the complex continued to welcome holiday makers while a permanent solution for the financial challenges was sought. By August 2015 the reported cash deficit had increased to more than 40 Million francs, but this was still comfortably less than the estimated value of the assets. In an interview given to the travel press Gion Fravi, the hotel director installed by the management company, stated that around 40 investors had expressed an interest in purchasing the assets, though he refused to enter into speculation about a possible sale price, given the pressure on running costs exacerbated by the increasing value of the Swiss Franc against the Euro in the wake of the 2007 financial crash. During the closing months of 2015 the hotel was advertising jobs for the 2015/2016 season. The Flims Panorama The Flims Panorama by Giovanni Giacometti (1904) A triptych entitled \\"The Flims Panorama\\" was commissioned by the hotel director in 1904 from Giovanni Giacometti and presented to the hotel to celebrate the opening of the casino- pavilion in 1904. However, on the occasion of the buildings's first major restoration the tryptich was taken down it was subsequently hung in the pavilion's entrance lobby for a period. During a subsequent renovation, in 1968 the hotel director of the time, Roman Bezzola, asked the Fine Arts Museum in Chur about the value of the Giacometti tryptich. The Museum were dismissive, warned that costly restoration would be necessary, and even rejected an offer to gift the piece to them. They dismissed Giacometti as a mere \\"poster artist\\". The painting was rolled up and stored. However, in 1986 tastes had moved on, and the recently appointed hotel director Josef M√ºller rediscovered the work, recognized its value and had it restored. It now hangs in the main lobby.

It is found in the Indian Ocean to the NW of Australia, with a restricted distribution. Chimaera argiloba inhabits marine waters from a depth range of 370‚Äì520 m. It is abundant within its range.IUCN Redlist.orgFishbase.org Classification/Species The Chimaera argiloba, more commonly known as the Whitefin chimaera, comes from the genus Chimaera, which in Latin translates to 'marine monster'.1 The species name, argiloba, is in reference to the Greek meaning for 'white', and loba, a Latin word, refers to a 'rounded projection'.1 This full species name is derived from the unique posterior part of the first dorsal fin, which is both white and rounded, extending outwards.1 Differences from Other Species in Chimaera genus The genus Chimaera includes ten nominal species presented by Carl Linnaeus, which include Chimaera obscura, C. cubana, C. panthera, C. fulva, C. lignaria, C. jordani, C. macrospina, C. monstrosa, C. owstoni, and C. phantasma.1 C. argiloba shares the most similarities to C. phantasma, a species most commonly found in the northwestern Pacific.1These two species only have slight disparities in morphologies and color.1 C. argiloba is different from C. panther and C. owstoni in their color schemes and pattern distributions. Where C. argiloba is uniformly grey-silver, the other two species have a standout dark pattern.1 Additiionally, C. lignaria have a lavender blue color scheme, and C. macrospina, C. fulva, C. jordani, and C. obscura all have dark brown exteriors.1 Characteristics The genus Chimaera is part of the larger family Chimaeridae, which also includes the genus Hydrolagus.1 This genus differs from Chimaera in that these species do not have anal fins. Chimaera argiloba possess a medium length snout, ranging from 13.7-17.3 cm.1 From a dorso-ventral view, the snout is narrowly pointed, but is broadly pointed from a lateral point of view. On average, the whitefin chimaera has a horizontal head length of 10.7 cm, and a vertical height of 0.68 times the horizontal head length.1 In total, C. argiloba has a body length of 40 cm and a total length of more than 90 cm.1Another prominent characteristic is its large gill opening that is separated with a posterior flap that protrudes from the head base, and is interconnected with the back of the gill cover by a short tube.1 Color-wise, C. argiloba is grey-silver, both laterally and dorsally. On its ventral side, the color has a slightly paler hue compared to the rest of its body.1 Distribution Chimaera argiloba, the whitefin chimaera, is most commonly found in northwestern Australia in the Indian Ocean.1 This particular species does not have a broad distribution, but there have been known findings off the shores of North Caledonia and Indonesia.1 C. argiloba reside in waters at a depth of 370 meters, and even going deeper ranging to depths of 520 meters.1 Threats C. argiloba is not widely used for commercial distribution purposes, but is subjected to other minor threats. One arising threat is the capture of this species by fisheries originally set on teleost fish and prawns off the coast of northwestern Australia.2 Companies such as the North West Slope Trawl Fishery and Commonwealth Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery operate around these areas where the Whitefin chimaera reside.2 They implement trawl gear that go to depths greater than 300 m, having the potential to inadvertently catch C. argioloba.2 However, these two fisheries have relatively low activity, and when they do catch these species, the whitefin chimaera are kept alive and usually released back into the waters.2 References 1\\\\.

Helicopters and thermal-heat detecting technology were used in this massive manhunt.Logan, Dylan, and Galoforo, Claire, \\"Fugitive who shot at police seen in Kentucky\\", Associated Press, October 29, 2015. Initial confrontation After an August bench warrant for \\"failure to appear\\" in court over a methamphetamines charge was issued by a Circuit Judge from Hardin County, Kentucky, months went by as Floyd Cook hovered under the radar as a wanted man, until Saturday, October 24, 2015. On that Saturday afternoon, in Algood, Tennessee, a small town on Interstate 40 midway between Nashville and Knoxville, Ahscari Valencia, an Algood police officer, stopped to help a black Ford F-150 believing the occupants to be stranded.Higdon, James. \\"Manhunt continues for fugitive accused of shooting at police officers three times in two states\\", Washington Post online, October 29, 2015. As Valencia walked towards the truck, Cook fired multiple shots from his handgun, hitting Officer Valencia in the abdomen portion of his bulletproof vest. Valencia lived. Cook fled north towards Kentucky. Heading north into Kentucky on the west side of Dale Hollow Lake, Cook fled in his black F-150 truck on back roads, where he encountered Jeremy Baker, a Kentucky State Police officer, about 50 miles north of Algood. Baker tried to stop the black Ford F-150, but Cook kept on running, turned onto a side road that dead ended, which caused Cook to crash his truck. At 5:04pm, shots were reported fired, radioed in by Baker. Neither Cook nor Baker were wounded after the shootout. Cook then proceeded to flee on foot, disappearing into the wooded foothills. Warrant The outstanding warrant for Floyd Ray Cook's arrest stemmed from trafficking methamphetamines and tampering with evidence charges in Hardin County, Kentucky. On June 27, 2015, Floyd Ray Cook was arrested by the Hardin County Sheriff Department in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, after a traffic stop discovered that Cook possessed methamphetamines, and charged him with first degree trafficking and tampering with physical evidence, because he tried to destroy them. Cook was released on a $75,000 partially secured bond. A month later, he failed to appear in Hardin County Circuit Court, so the Circuit Court Judge issued a bench warrant for his arrest. Developments A special team for the Kentucky State Police arrived on the scene by Saturday night and resumed their search on Sunday, when a young man called police saying he had seen Cook enter his father's (James Boles) house on 963 Dulworth Road, about a mile and a half from where Cook had wrecked his truck the day before, in Cumberland County. Many tear gas canisters were fired into the house by the authorities, but Cook could not be found.Boswell, Jake. http://www.wbko.com/content/news/BREAKING-Police-search- for-shooter-in-Cumberland-County--336711321.html On Sunday night, the manhunt was called off due to weather and darkness. For three days, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, Cumberland County Public Schools were closed down by the order of the Superintendent Kirk Biggerstaff. Eventually, the FBI and U.S. Marshals joined in. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation offered a $1,000 reward. On Tuesday, 1:30 p.m., the 963 Dulworth Road house a few miles south of Burkesville that Floyd Cook was thought to have been located at earlier on Sunday, burned to the ground for mysterious, and intentional, reasons.Amons, Nancy. http://www.wbir.com/story/news/2015/10/28/search-expands-fugitive-who- shot-algood-officer/74727098/ On Wednesday, 8 p.m., 35 year old Katy McCarty and her boyfriend 50 year old Troy Wayne were arrested in connection to Cook, although they were found in White House, Tennessee, just north of Nashville, by a US Marshal many miles away from Cookeville or Burksville, where the initial debacle unfolded. Floyd Cook never left the forest-covered mountains of Cumberland County, Kentucky, after crashing his F-150. During their getaway, Wayne and McCarty rammed 2 police cars, a US Marshal shot at them, missed, and then they drove through the small town of White House. Wayne and McCarty eventually drove down a dead end cul-de-sac street in a suburb, crashed their vehicle, and proceeded to run by foot through the surrounding cornfields. McCarty was found in the mud near the cornfield, and Wayne was found several blocks away, walking on the sidewalk. Killing of Cook On Thursday, October 29, 2015, Cook showed up at a local Kentucky man's house in the afternoon. His sister was about to leave his house, and as she was clicking her keys to unlock her car, she thought she spotted a shadow by the garage. When she looked up, Floyd Cook was standing in front of her, next to a post, next to the garage. Floyd Cook wouldn't identify himself, and told the woman, \\"I mean you no harm.

History The scheme began in 1978 and was devised by the then-head of Head of BBC Light Entertainment (Radio), David Hatch, and BBC Television's Head of Light Entertainment, James Gilbert. Each department put ¬£5000 a year into a kitty to employ three young writers on a one-year contract. The only proviso was that there was to be no contract for a second year, and that the writers must then fend for themselves. The first beneficiaries were Rory McGrath, Jimmy Mulville and Guy Jenkin, who were followed by Rob Grant, Doug Naylor (Red Dwarf). Since then, the scheme has helped several aspiring or part-time writers to go full- time and has produced a great number of professional writers and comedians, including John O'Farrell, Peter Baynham, Stewart Lee and Simon Blackwell (The Thick Of It, Veep). Duties of recipients Under the current regime, those selected for the bursary work on BBC Radio 4's three high-profile topical shows; The News Quiz, The Now Show and Dead Ringers, contribute writing across the range of the BBC Radio Comedy Department's output as well as script- editing sketch-shows and sitcoms. Bursary recipients are also encouraged to develop new formats and create their own shows. List of recipients The names of the writers who have received the bursary were first displayed on a commemorative wooden plaque, set up at the retirement of the Head of Light Entertainment Radio, Jonathan James-Moore. Following the Department's change of location, the current whereabouts of the plaque are unknown. The list of writers' names was later displayed in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying \\"Beware of The Leopard\\". * 1978: Rory McGrath, Jimmy Mulville, Guy Jenkin * 1979: Rob Grant, Doug Naylor, Martin Bergman * 1980: Jon Canter, Angus Deayton, Tony Sarchet * 1981: Scheme not run * 1982: James Hendrie, Eddie Canfor-Dumas, David Jackson Young * 1983: John Collee, Roger Planer * 1984: Jack Docherty, Moray Hunter * 1985: Malcolm Williamson, Stuart Silver, Alan Whiting * 1986: Stephen Punt, David Bond, Paul Hawksbee * 1987: Mike Coleman, Bill Matthews, Ged Parsons, Les Peters Rowley * 1988: John O‚ÄôFarrell, Mark Burton * 1989: Peter Kerry, Simon Bullivant, Mark Brisenden * 1990: Peter Baynham, Barry Atkins * 1991: Robert Steele, Julian Dutton, Richard Herring, Stewart Lee * 1992: Clive Coleman, Andy Riley, Kevin Cecil * 1993: Rob Colley, Millie Murray, Paul Powell, Georgia Pritchett * 1994: Dan Gaster, Andrew Clifford, Debbie Barham, Hugh Rycroft * 1995: Will Ing, Kay Stonham * 1996: Ben Ward, Dave Lamb, Tony Roche * 1997: Felix Riley, Tom Jamieson * 1998: Nev Fountain, Simon Blackwell * 1999: Jon Holmes, Andy Hurst * 2001-2003: Scheme not run * 2004: Rhodri Crooks, Paul Kerensa * 2005-2006: Scheme not run * 2007: Danielle Ward, Kieron Quirke * 2008: James Sherwood, Stephen Carlin * 2009: Gareth Gwynn, John-Luke Roberts * 2010: Jon Hunter, James Kettle * 2011: Benjamin Partridge, Andy Wolton * 2012: Jack Bernhardt, Tom Neenan * 2013: James Bugg, Grainne Maguire * 2014: Gabby Hutchinson Crouch, Max Davis * 2015: Sarah Campbell, Liam Beirne * 2016: Robin Morgan, Jenny Laville * 2017: Laura Major, Mike Shephard * 2018: Kat Sadler, Catherine Brinkworth * 2019: Simon Alcock, Charlie Dinkin References * Category:British television articles by importance ","title":"BBC Radio Comedy Writers Bursary"},{"id":"48413240","text":"Season of Monsters () is a 1987 Hungarian drama film written by Gyula Hern√°di and directed by Mikl√≥s Jancs√≥.

First proposed in the Mayor of London's ¬£1.3trn London Infrastructure 2050 plan, the line would use some existing National Rail and London Overground lines, linked by stretches of new railway. History Issue 755 of Rail Magazine (20 August 2014) reported that Boris Johnson, the then Mayor of London had started consulting on a new Zone 3 orbital railway, the 'R25'. The nickname alludes to London's M25 orbital motorway. The idea featured in news media when the Mayor visited Barking Riverside, a large development held up by lack of rail access. The idea of extending the Gospel Oak to Barking Line trains onto the Tilbury Loop line to serve a station near Barking Riverside had already gained some ground having been mentioned in the 2013 budget statement, but news reports showed a tube map-like extract with a new line crossing the River Thames to serve Abbey Wood. Recently, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has proposed that an extension to Abbey Wood should be built as a later extension to the Barking Riverside Extension project. There have also been calls to extend the line further south across the river to Thamesmead and Abbey Wood.http://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/sadiq-khan-gives-go- ahead-to-barking-overground-extension-1-4722444 In August 2017, the Government granted permission for the extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking Line and a provision for a stop at Renwick Road (if needed) and states that a further extension across the Thames should be provisioned.

The inequality was conjectured in 1963 by Henryk Minc and first proved in 1973 by Lev M. Bregman. Further entropy-based proofs have been given by Alexander Schrijver and Jaikumar Radhakrishnan. The Bregman‚ÄìMinc inequality is used, for example, in graph theory to obtain upper bounds for the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph.  Statement  The permanent of a square binary matrix A = (a_{ij}) of size n with row sums r_i = a_{i1} + \\\\cdots + a_{in} for i=1, \\\\ldots , n can be estimated by :\\\\operatorname{per}A \\\\leq \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (r_i!)^{1/r_i}. The permanent is therefore bounded by the product of the geometric means of the numbers from 1 to r_i for i=1, \\\\ldots , n. Equality holds if the matrix is a block diagonal matrix consisting of matrices of ones or results from row and/or column permutations of such a block diagonal matrix. Since the permanent is invariant under transposition, the inequality also holds for the column sums of the matrix accordingly.  Application  A binary matrix and the corresponding bipartite graph with a possible perfect matching marked in red. According to the Bregman‚ÄìMinc inequality, there are at most 18 perfect matchings in this graph. There is a one-to-one correspondence between a square binary matrix A of size n and a simple bipartite graph G = (V \\\\, \\\\dot\\\\cup \\\\, W, E) with equal-sized partitions V = \\\\\\\\{ v_1, \\\\ldots , v_n \\\\\\\\} and W = \\\\\\\\{ w_1, \\\\ldots , w_n \\\\\\\\} by taking :a_{ij} = 1 \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\\\\\{ v_i, w_j \\\\\\\\} \\\\in E. This way, each nonzero entry of the matrix A defines an edge in the graph G and vice versa. A perfect matching in G is a selection of n edges, such that each vertex of the graph is an endpoint of one of these edges. Each nonzero summand of the permanent of A satisfying :a_{1\\\\sigma(1)} \\\\cdots a_{n\\\\sigma(n)} = 1 corresponds to a perfect matching \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{ v_1, w_{\\\\sigma(1)} \\\\\\\\}, \\\\ldots , \\\\\\\\{ v_n, w_{\\\\sigma(n)} \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} of G. Therefore, if \\\\mathcal{M}(G) denotes the set of perfect matchings of G, : \\\\mathcal{M}(G)  = \\\\operatorname{per}A holds. The Bregman‚ÄìMinc inequality now yields the estimate : \\\\mathcal{M}(G)  \\\\leq \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (d(v_i)!)^{1/d(v_i)}, where d(v_i) is the degree of the vertex v_i. Due to symmetry, the corresponding estimate also holds for d(w_i) instead of d(v_i). The number of possible perfect matchings in a bipartite graph with equal-sized partitions can therefore be estimated via the degrees of the vertices of any of the two partitions.  Related statements  Using the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, the Bregman‚ÄìMinc inequality directly implies the weaker estimate :\\\\operatorname{per}A \\\\leq \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{r_i+1}{2}, which was proven by Henryk Minc already in 1963. Another direct consequence of the Bregman‚ÄìMinc inequality is a proof of the following conjecture of Herbert Ryser from 1960. Let k by a divisor of n and let \\\\Lambda_{kn} denote the set of square binary matrices of size n with row and column sums equal to k, then :\\\\max_{A \\\\in \\\\Lambda_{kn}} \\\\operatorname{per}A = (k!)^{n/k}. The maximum is thereby attained for a block diagonal matrix whose diagonal blocks are square matrices of ones of size k. A corresponding statement for the case that k is not a divisor of n is an open mathematical problem.

The Ancient Prussian Art Chamber was originally established by Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg in the mid 16th century, but was nearly destroyed during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). The art chamber was rebuilt as a magnificent collection by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, and was moved to the newly extended Berlin Palace by Frederick I of Prussia in the early 18th century. The Ethnological Museum opened in 1886 as a successor of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber; the Museum of Asian Art originated as the Indian Department of the Ethnological Museum in 1904. Wilhelm von Bode, the Director- General of the Royal Museums in Berlin, established the Museum of East Asian Art as a separate collection in 1906. In 2006 the Museum of Indian Art and the Museum of East Asian Art were merged to form the Museum of Asian Art.

The issue of the Palestinian refugees‚Äô return to Palestine is at the center of the PRC‚Äôs activities ‚Äúboth as a humanitarian and political concern.‚Äù According to its website, the PRC aims to preserve the Palestinian identity and to resist attempts to resettle the dispersed Palestinians in their places of refuge. The PRC coordinates with any individual or group that shares its cause. The organisation intends to ‚Äúincrease and widen awareness of the suffering of the Palestinians in the Diaspora‚Äù and to inform the general public in Europe and Britain in particular about the ‚Äútruth on the many different dimensions of the Palestinian issue.‚Äù Moreover, the organisation endeavours to ‚Äúestablish the status of Palestinian refugees under international law without any equivocation, and campaign for their basic human and legal rights.‚Äù Activities The PRC organises a wide range of events to promote the Palestinian cause both in the United Kingdom and in Europe. Among the most recent initiatives sponsored by the Palestinian Return Centre are a public seminar in the House of Lords held in June 2015, a public briefing in the House of Parliament in June 2015, and a workshop to support Palestinian refugees in Syria. In September 2015, the PRC organised an event to encourage public debate on the challenges facing the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), an organisation overtly supported by the Centre.

The Palestinian Return Centre and the Al Jazeera Centre for Studies joined to produce a new book Palestinian Refugees in the Arab World: Realities & Prospects This book, Palestinian Refugees in the Arab World: Realities and Prospects looks at the most significant aspects of the Palestinian refugee and explores the future possibilities of their plight through studies and papers presented by a group of experts and researchers. The Register of Depopulated Localities in Palestine The Palestinian Nakba is unsurpassed in history.For a country to be occupied by a foreign minority, emptied almost entirely of its people, its physical and cultural landmarks obliterated, its destruction hailed as a miraculous act of God and a victory for freedom and civilised values, all done according to a premeditated plan, meticulously executed, financially and politically supported from abroad, and still maintained today, is no doubt unique. The Future of the Exiled Palestinians in the Settlement Agreements The subject of the Oslo accords and the future of the exiled Palestinians is discussed today with a deep sense of urgency among themselves as well as their kinfolk in Palestine. These discussions are, more often than not, accompanied by intense feelings of anxiety expressed in the recurrent terms of; bewilderment, loss, and misery. In its series of non-periodical publications, the Palestinian Return Centre/London has published a book titled ‚ÄúThe Displaced Palestinians in Lebanon - the bitterness of refuge and tragedies of migration ‚Äù by the representative of the centre in Lebanon, Mr Ali Huwaidi. The book consists of 146 pages, and covers the political and humanitarian situation of the displaced Palestinians in Lebanon. The book sheds light on the category of displaced Palestinians, a marginalised and absent group on local, regional and international levels. In spite of efforts by research and study centres, activists, and those concerned with the issue of Palestinian refugees, in publishing studies, articles and reports, it was noted that this category of the Palestinian people‚Äîwho sought refuge in the camps of Lebanon after the Nakba of 1948, and especially in the two camps of al Nabatiyah in South Lebanon, and Tel al Zater in East Beirut‚Äîhave not been covered. In 2006 Dr. Tariq M. Suwaidan was the author of Palestine Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow . This book is a brief overview of the long and turbulent history of Palestine, from its dawn to the present day. It is chronological sequence of events to demonstrate the significance of the ‚ÄòHoly Land‚Äò one of the territories over which much blood has been split throughout history. The Palestinian Return Centre (PRC) has published the 2010 Edition of The Atlas of Palestine 1917-1966 prepared by the Palestinian writer and historian, Dr. Salman Abu Sitta. The Atlas is an outcome of more than 20 years of extensive research and academic work. It is an extended and edited edition of the \\"Atlas of Palestine 1948\\", published in 2004. M. Siraj Sait (2003) Reappraisal of the Rights of Palestinian Refugee Children in the Occupied Territories. \\"War on children\\" is undoubtedly one of the most inhuman legacies of the 20th century. More than 1.5 million children were killed in wars worldwide during the 1990s. Palestinian children were not exempted from this scourge. To mark the third anniversary of the Aqsa Intifada the PRC decided to organise a special week of activities in honour of the sacrifices of Palestinian children. The publication of this thought-provoking study falls within the scope of these activities. Dr. Daud Abdullah edited in 2002 the book titled Israeli Law of Return and its Impact on the Conflict in Palestine. This book is the product of a conference organised by the Palestinian Return Centre, in London, in April 2002 under the same title. It reviews the origins of the Israeli Law of Return, its objectives, development and impact on the conflict in Palestine. The 16 essays presented here are arranged under four broad headings: from the past, ingathering the exiles, building the ethnic state, and legal issues and the future. Dr. Salman Abu Sitta wrote in 1999 Palestinian Right to Return Sacred, Legal and Possible. Together with al Nakba Register and the map of Palestine 1948, also distributed by the PRC, this booklet should provide a concise description of the refugees issue. It should be clear by now to all concerned that there can be no peace in the Middle East without the return of the refugees to their homes.  Conferences  Vienna, 7 May 2005 (PRC) - The Palestinian Return Centre, London, the Palestinian Association in Austria and the Expatriate Society in Austria organised a well-attended conference of Palestinian communities in Europe under the title ‚Äò‚ÄòPalestine: Land and People - an integral and indivisible unit. No to the racist wall in Palestine'. Representatives and delegations of Palestinian communities from 21 European countries participated in the conference. Several members of the Arab diplomatic corps in Austria, officials from the Austrian government, as well as prominent members of Arab and Muslim communities participated. In March 2006, PRC held a seminar in the Brunei lecture theatre at the University of London, with the broad participation of Palestinian organisations and figures, both official and non-governmental. The seminar titled \\"Towards an effective role for the Palestinians abroad in supporting the independence of the economy at home\\" was opened by the director of the Palestinian Return Centre, Majed Al-Zeer, who pointed to the importance of this seminar at these most difficult of times for the Palestinian people. Sweden, 6 May 2006 (PRC) - The Fourth Palestinians in Europe Conference was successfully convened in the Swedish city of Malmo. It was held under the title ‚ÄòDeep rooted Identity and Firm Adherence to their Rights.' The conference was organised by the Palestinian Return Centre, London, and hosted by the Adalah Centre in Sweden. About 5,000 guests attended the event. They included delegations from all over the European continent, representatives of Palestinian associations, institutions and organisations both from within Europe and beyond. The Seventh Palestinians in Europe conference concluded with distinct success under the theme ‚ÄúReturn is a right, no Consent and no Concession‚Äù on 2 May 2009 in Milan, Italy. Thousands of Palestinians from all over the continent participated in the work of the conference attended by prominent Palestinian leaders from the Occupied homeland and abroad, in addition to a large number of public figures and representatives of Arab, Islamic and European institutions and solidarity forces. In 2011, PRC hosted a diverse range of distinguished speakers at their annual conference in London. The conference marked the launch of the second annual Palestine Memorial Week. Dr Ghada Karmi, herself a victim of the original expulsion stated: ‚ÄúThe Nakba is not an historic event; it goes on every day and should not be viewed as a part of a painful past that we need to overcome.‚Äù Dr Salman Abu Sitta gave a ground-breaking presentation exposing the systematic expulsion of Palestinians in 1948 and revealing the ample space in what is now Israel that can incorporate all the Palestinian refugees and the rebuilding of their destroyed villages. He urged young British people to follow in the footsteps of their parents and grandparents who opposed the Nazis and Fascists in Europe in the 1930s and 40s and oppose the Nakba. The third Palestine Memorial Week organised by the Palestinian Return Centre (PRC) concluded after a comprehensive week of events across the UK. The week of activities, took place from 16 to 23 January 2012, aimed at commemorating the memory of Palestinian victims over the past Six decades especially the last war in Gaza. Various events took place across British universities and also at the Houses of Parliament. A tour was carried out to familiarise British audience with the latest developments in occupied Palestine.  International recognition  On 1 June 2015 the Palestinian Return Centre was among the 10 groups recommended by the UN Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations for special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. The PRC obtained special consultative status with 12 votes in favour, 3 against (Israel, United States and Uruguay) and 3 abstentions (Greece, India, Russian Federation) and one absent member (Burundi). Despite Israel‚Äôs objection, on 20 July 2015 the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) approved the recommendation.

She is a two-masted auxiliary rigged schooner, built in 1924 by the noted naval architect John G. Alden, and is noted for her racing success on the Great Lakes. She is now owned and operated by the Portland Schooner Company, which offers sailing tours of Casco Bay, using Bagheera and Wendameen. Bagheera was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history Bagheera is a wooden- hulled auxiliary schooner, measuring in length with a deck of . Her beam is , and she has a draft of . Her frame is white oak, with pine planking, flooring, and ceilings. Her rails are mahogany, and her bowsprit and spars are sitka spruce. The deck is fiberglass (a replacement for the original teak), laid on oak beams. The outside of the hull is painted black. Her present rigging, similar to the original, is gaff rigging. The auxiliary power is provided by a c. 2000 82 horsepower Westerbeke diesel engine. The interior retains substantial woodwork and equipment, including its original wheel. Bagheera was built at the Rice Brothers Shipyard in East Boothbay, Maine, in 1924, to a design by John G. Alden, by then already a well-known designer of sailing ships. Her design is of a class known as Malabar schooners, although she is both longer and wider than most instances of the class. She was built for Marion Eppley, and was originally called Beacon Rock, after her estate in Newport, Rhode Island. Eppley berthed her at Newport, and sold her in 1928 to Robert Benedict. He renamed her Bagheera, and moved her to Chicago, where she embarked on a successful racing career on the Great Lakes, which lasted roughly until 1938. She was used as a training vessel during World War II, and was shipped to the Mediterranean Sea in the 1950s and sailed back to the United States. In 1948 her gaff rigging was replaced by a Marconi rig. By the 1980s she had been sailed to the west coast, and outfitted for passenger trade. \\"Bagheera\\" is now being used as a floating universal classroom for students and professors from Saint Joseph's College's Environmental Science Semester.

It is organised by the African Renaissance Foundation (AREFO). The event reflects the significance of the ancient town during the slave trade era. It is a convergence of culture and display of African heritage. The organizer brings the indegine and culture-loving fans from around the world to celebrate the festival. One of the major highlights is the artistic display by masquerades, dancers, and fire eaters. It features football competition, the beating of Sato drum, and Liberation Day Celebration. History The festival was initiated in 1999 to commemorate the end of the slave trade era and the significance of the ancient city during the period. The 2015 Badagry festival was tagged \\"Toussaint L'Ouverture: The Catalyst for the struggle for liberation of the black\\". The event started on 20 August and ended on 30 August 2015. The festival creates a platform in Nigeria of those from the African diaspora to reunite with their motherland. It was held at Badagry Grammar School, Badagry, Lagos, Nigeria. =City slave history= The name Badagry derives from the means of livelihood of the indigenous people of the city, which include fishing, farming, salt making. However, others believe the city was named after Agbedeh, a popular farmer, whose farm was named Agbadarigi, which was later pronounced Badagry by the Europeans. In the early 18th century Badagry served as a route for the Europeans when slaves were transported to the new destination of their buyers. It houses the cenotaph \\"Point of No Return\\", a place where the well was enchanted to ensure that slaves who drank from it forgot its destination. At the end of the 18th century, Badagry was one of the routes that benefited from the recurrent battle between Portnovo and Dahomey for the movement of slaves. Badagry was noted as the auction point for slaves captured during inter-village warfare. In 1983, Chief Mobee was among the African chiefs who participated in the slave trade. The first two-storey building was built in Marina, Badagry, in 1845. Presently, the site is facing massive environmental degradation due to lack of maintenance by the government, as well as the activities of commercial tree fellers. The government of Babatunde Fashola in an effort to reignite the glory of the city has started the construction of Badagry Expressway project, commissioning of Badagry Marina project.

Moray also have a 2xv that competes in the BT Caledonia 3 North League. Moray has a number of youth teams taken from different age groups including micros and minis, S1 and S2, Under-16, Under-18 team. They play their rugby at Morriston Park in Elgin, Moray. History  To introduce rugby into such a strong soccer stronghold as Elgin, took courage and was bound to bring setbacks. In fact, the first attempt was made as long ago as 1903 by the then rector of Elgin Academy. It was, however, not long before the oval ball was forced to give way to the round one. Twenty years and World War 1 were to elapse before a second attempt was made and again the man responsible was a rector of Elgin Academy ‚Äì Mr Iain Graham Andrew. As far as records show, the formation of the Moray Rugby Club took place on 3 March 1923 at a meeting in the drillhall in Elgin. Mr George C. Christie was elected as president. It was agreed that it was feasible to form a club and application was sent to the Scottish Rugby Union to become an affiliated member. In September 1923 the town council approved the use of part of the local Cooper Park for the game of rugby by the Club. The first match took place against Inverness Highland when Moray won 14 ‚Äì 5. In these early days, the opposition came from Highland, Ross-shire, and the Army sides. The club adopted the colours of Elgin Academy ‚Äì Red and White shirts with Navy Blue shorts. In 1925 the Brin Cup was donated for competition among the clubs in the North. Up until the outbreak of war in 1939, Moray went on to win this cup several times. After hostilities ceased in 1945, the Club reconvened in September 1946 with Dr Thow as president, and a dentist called George Cusetter as captain. The amount of Naval and R.A.F. personnel stationed around the Moray area gave the Club many more teams to play and also helped to improve the standard of play. A Valuable nursery was provided by Elgin Academy. Such was the enthusiasm for the game that it was not uncommon for some of the Senior Schoolboys to play for the School in the morning and for Moray in the afternoon. In 1960, the Club moved their playing field to Morriston Park, and was able to field 2 teams. In 1973, the Club celebrated its 50th anniversary when the rugby enthusiastic in the area had the privilege of seeing several internationalists playing for the presidents XV against the Moray Select. The Club was honoured by the presence of Dr. J.R.S. Innes, then Vice President of the Scottish Rugby Union, who proposed a toast to the Club at the official dinner after the game. In 1975-76 the Club joined the S.R.U. Schweppe League in the 7th division and, by the end of the season, were promoted to the 6th division. During the club‚Äôs peak in the early 1980s, Moray reached the 5th division and ran 3 XV‚Äôs and a colts side. The Club took another step forward when the Clubhouse was opened. This event was marked by a special game between the Presidents XV Select and the North Midlands Select on Sunday 25 October 1985. Special permission was obtained from the Scottish Rugby Union to play on a Sunday. After the game, the Clubhouse was opened by W.L. CONNON, the Vice President of the S.R.U. In recent years, Moray has seen a period of success where it has narrowly missed out on promotion to BT Caledonia Division 1 on a number of occasions. In 2016-17 Moray finished 3rd in the league missing out on promotion to eventual champions Banff RFC. Despite this setback, Moray ended the season with silverware by winning the BT Caledonia North Regional Bowl when they defeated fierce local rivals RAF Lossiemouth 8-7. Moray also missed out on the opportunity to play at Murrayfield after a heartbreaking semi final defeat against Portobello in the National Bowl. In 2017-18, for the first time in over 15 years, Moray were able to field a 2nd XV which entered BT Caledonia Division 3. =2016-17 Season= The 2016-17 season was one for silverware, yet one that ultimately ended in heartbreak. Moray started the season in impressive fashion, winning 9 out of their first 10 fixtures. Morriston proved to be a fortress for the Elgin men, as they spent the first half of the season unbeaten at their riverside home. A lengthy winter break caused to be problematic for Moray as their form dipped after the new year. Some damaging results, in particular narrow defeats to eventual champions Banff and a last minute defeat to Aberdeen Grammar 2xv eventually saw Moray finish 3rd, therefore missing out on promotion. The season was new head coach Barry Grimwood's first, and despite the eventual disappointment, the feeling around the club was optimistic that happier times lay ahead. The season saw Club Captain John Westmacott step down from the role after 3 seasons wearing the armband. Hulking No 8 John Stuart won the club's player of the year, while Centre Harvey Freeman finished up as top Try scorer. Winger Connor McWilliam finished as top points scorer after a consistent season with the right boot. Despite the late season collapse in the league, the cup competitions provided Moray with silverware for the first time in nearly 5 years. Moray advanced to the final of the Caledonia North Regional Bowl, where they faced local rivals RAF Lossiemouth. A tense and dramatic final, Moray took the spoils when they scored a last minute penalty, courtesy of veteran Fly Half, Chris Clarke. Lossiemouth had initially taken the lead from a penalty, before John Stuart scored a try to make it 5-3 heading into the last quarter. A second Lossiemouth penalty saw the Owls take the lead before Clarke's last minute heroics. Courtesy of winning the bowl, Moray were entered into the Caledonia national bowl where they were eventually knocked out at the semi final stage by Edinburgh-based Portobello. Another tense and dramatic encounter, the Edinbugh side ran out 17-10 winners. =2017-18 Season= 1xv The 2017-18 season saw several changes within the 1xv squad. There were several departures with Flanker Will Vernon and Winger Connor McWilliam leaving due to attendance at University, while centre Leon Keirl left for RAF Lossiemouth. Long serving hooker Lewis Higgins was named as new club captain, while his front row compatriots Mark Taylor and Nathan Gilmore were named as vice captains. The club also saw the return of veteran lock forward Callum Purcell, while Irish Flanker Stefan O Tobain joined the club. Fullback Callum Wright also returned to the red and white after leaving the British Army. Moray continued their form from previous seasons and currently sit 2nd in the league. They have suffered just two defeats in the league, a surprise defeat to struggling Deeside and a home defeat to bitter rivals Highland 2xv. They remain the only team to so far beat runaway league leaders Ellon and currently sit 9 points behind the North Aberdeenshire team. Wing Lewis Scott, a converted forward, is the leading try scorer with 11 try's, while Callum Wright is leading the way for points scored. The cup competition has been less successful as Moray were forced to withdraw from the 2017‚Äì18 Caledonia National Shield due to players being unavailable. 2xv For the first time in over 15 years, Moray were able to field a 2xv team that entered BT Caledonia Division 3. Utility forward, Matthew Lackie was named Captain, while former front row, Richard Burgin was named head coach. The season has mainly been a struggle, as a new squad adapts to the rigours of Rugby in the 3rd division. A mixture of newcomers to the sport, players returning to the game after a period of absence and players making the step up from the under 18's has seen Moray suffer some chastising defeats. Moray currently sit 10th (third from bottom) however their performances have been better than their results suggest. The early signs are encouraging and giving time, this new team will grow and progress into a cohesive and competitive unit.

In the eighteenth century the Blue Vein turnpike marked the end of the Lacock Turnpike Trust's road from Lacock, before travellers had to cross the open ground of Kingsdown towards the Bath Trust's road into Bathford. This place was renowned for robberies by highwaymen such as John Poulter. In 1737 the Horse and Jockey Inn was built 300 yards down the road to the south east, where wealthy travellers could stay, and be met and escorted safely to Bath. Half way between Blue Vein and the extant former inn, now known as Old Jockey, lie three bronze age round barrows on the north side of the road. The Bricker's Barn Trust constructed a northern London-Bath turnpike route in 1761 (now the A4).

Some of the replanted trees have included mountain ash and silver birch, both native broadleaf trees, which has led to a wider variety of birds in these areas. Connection to crimes Drumkeeragh Forest was the scene of the death of Penny McAllister. On 27 March 1991 McAllister had her throat slit by her husband's lover, Susan Christie, while they walked together in the woods. Christie originally claimed that a \\"wild bearded man\\" attacked them both but she was later convicted of manslaughter. On 20 December 2004 Karen McMullan was left at Drumkeeragh forest, along with her burnt out car, after being held hostage for more than 24 hours. The kidnapping was part of the robbery of Northern Bank headquarters in Belfast, where her husband worked.

He was the prince of Orchha and son of maharaja Vir Singh Deo. He was born in 1664 and died in 1688 at the age of 24. A temple of Hardoul is very famous in whole Bhuldelkhand many pilgrims are coming every year. According to the local people he is still alive and is their god. He is sometimes considered to be a nephew of Alha and Udal of Mahoba (see Alhakhand), however Alha and Udal were Banaphars living during the Chandella rule, where as Lala Hardoul was a Bundela. Folklore Hardoul, the popular prince, was resented by Jhujjar Singh (Hardols elder brother) who suspected his wife of having an illicit relationship with him. Jhujjar ordered his wife to poison Hardoul to prove her innocence, and Hardoul willingly accepted it. The story doesn't end here. When Jhujjar's niece was getting married, his sister asked the king to help; who sarcastically asked her to seek the dead Hardoul. The dead prince apparently attended the wedding and served the guests as well. The local woman exclaimed that even today it is believed that Lala Hardoul attends weddings he is invited to and most locals leave an invitation card for him and seek his blessings as well. I did see a lot of local patrons around the temple and realised that real India lives somewhere in the legends of Lala Hardoul.http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chen-columns/the-dead- prince-who-is-still-alive/article2720550.eceforts of Bundelkhand book by rita sharma  The dead prince who is still alive  Standing from the terrace of the Jehangir Mahal, I can see the monuments of Orchha framed against the dawn with the mist gently hovering over them. Beyond the terrace of the Raj Mahal, is the towering Chaturbhuj temple with the Ram Raj Mandir adjacent to it. And in the distant horizon, lies the Laxmi Narayan temple, hardly visible in the mist. The vultures distract me as the eyes scan the remaining montage of monuments, all wrapped in a hazy sheet of white, orange and yellow. But as I gaze at them, I realise that Orchha is not just a landscape of buildings. It is a town where the walls speak stories, where paintings reveal a culture, where tales of friendship, romance, betrayal, mysticism and sacrifice echo from every monument. Intriguing, funny, unbelievable and irresistible these stories breathe life into these ancient mahals and mandirs, some of them still in ruins. While most guides will show you the paintings of the Raj Mahal and tell you how Jehangir Mahal is a symbol of friendship between the Mughal emperor and a Bundelkhand king, they will not take you down to the Rai Praveen Mahal close by. Stories around royalty are always infused with romance and here is your own Anarkali‚ÄìPrince Salim story, except that this is no tragedy. The romance between courtesan Rai Praveen and the Bundelkhand king Indrajit became lore in the works of poet Keshav Das. One common folk tale speaks of how Akbar wanted her in his harem against the wishes of the Bundelkhand king. But the witty courtesan spoke her way out of Akbar's heart who sent her back to Orchha. She apparently thwarted the Mughal emperor saying, ‚ÄúOnly a royal servant or a crow or a dog will like to eat something that has already been tasted and polluted by another.‚Äù I am more fascinated by the lesser known monuments and the local versions around it. After seeing the three temples ‚Äî Ram Raja Temple, Chaturbhuj and the exquisite Laxmi Narayan temple which houses murals of Jhansi Rani ‚Äî I decide to hire a local auto driver who claims ‚Äònetagiri‚Äô is his main business and agrees to show me around. He shows me two tall pillars that stand amidst a colourful but dirty market. They are called Sawan Bhadon. The locals say that they stand for two brothers who meet everyday at midnight. And I hear this version as well. Bagh Raj, son of Bir Singh Deo, met a seer during a hunting expedition. The seer, who was observing a vow of silence, was quiet when the prince asked him about a particular kill he was chasing. But the prince misunderstood the silence and went in the wrong direction. After a long frustrating day, he ordered the seer to be killed instead. The just king in return ordered the death of the prince. If you still believe that these pillars stand for the seer and the prince, then think again. Only my guide book offers a plausible connection that these could be ventilators of an underground chamber for the army. They actually look like tall chimney vents to me. And then I hear the most interesting tale of all, which would probably match up to a soap opera. It is the story behind the ruins of a melancholic yellow palace which now houses a bazaar ‚Äî the palace of Dinman Hardoul, brother of Raja Jhujjar. A small temple close by has made the prince into a God. ‚ÄúWoh hamara bhagwan hai, hamari raksha karta hai, kabhi bhi zinda aayega,‚Äù said a local woman, claiming that Hardol is alive and is their God. And that is when my netagiri guide tells me this story. Hardoul, the popular prince, was resented by Jhujjar who further suspected his wife of having an illicit relationship with him. Jhujjar ordered his wife to poison Hardoul to prove her innocence, and Hardoul willingly accepted it. The story doesn't end here. When Jhujjar's niece was getting married, his sister asked the king to help; who sarcastically asked her to seek the dead Hardoul. The dead prince apparently attended the wedding and served the guests as well. The local woman exclaimed that even today it is believed that Lala Hardoul attends weddings he is invited to and most locals leave an invitation card for him and seek his blessings as well. I did see a lot of local patrons around the temple and realised that real India lives somewhere in the legends of Lala Hardoul.

Gameplay involves puzzle-solving, character arcs, and a story of hope and humanity in the traditions of science fiction stories. In August 2013 a demo version was released for review. On January 21, 2014, the game was Greenlit on the Steam distribution platform. On July 22, 2015, it was announced that the developers had begun to publish a prologue on the Internet. Each week, a new episodic chapter was published online providing more information about the background of the characters, the game world and the colonizing mission. The full game was released on November 6, 2015. Story After living for generations as persecuted refugees, the Letarri people set their sights on a far-off planet as a promising new home. But when the interstellar mission to colonize the new world goes terribly awry, the fate of their people falls into the hands of a lone adventurer. It's up to the player to unravel the mystery of what happened. The game's title refers to the natural phenomenon of a solar prominence. Gameplay The game is a first- person adventure game similar to the Myst and Riven series with a point and click interface in neo futuristic and industrial game settings. The player may also pan around a location by clicking and dragging the mouse. Clicking the mouse to go in a certain direction results in a transition video showing the player's movement. Some puzzles come in the form of a retro text-based computer interface or 2D GUI puzzles. Development The first story treatment was written in January 2006. Originally they used a modified Nucleosys SCream engine; formerly used for the point and click horror adventure game, Scratches. In 2009 they developed an in-house proprietary engine which would better fulfill the game's needs.

(2008). Participatory journalism practices in the media and beyond: an international comparative study of initiatives in online newspapers.

(2015) Violent video games and physical aggression: Evidence for a selection effect among adolescents. Psychology of Popular Media Culture (Online First). doi: 10.1037/ppm0000035 and cyberbullying. While Quandt's work is also focusing the problematic side of digital media use, he asks for a neutral and balanced perspective on media use, including positive aspects of use. Quandt argues that research on digital media has to ‚Äònormalize‚Äô and move beyond a state of repeating moral panics. He is one of the authors of an open debate paper to the WHO, criticizing the introduction of Gaming Disorder as a \\"disorder due to addictive behaviors\\" in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases, which they see as a result of a \\"moral panic around the harm of video gaming\\". The authors mention several \\"fundamental issues\\" of Gaming Disorder in their paper, which triggered a public debate. Quandt's large-scale, representative survey studies on online gamers were widely cited, as they did not support the popular notion of notable differences between gamers and non-gamers. This is especially true for his analyses on digital games addiction that showed a relatively low level of stable problematic behavior. His team's work on sexism among gamers was picked up by the international press and gamers alike, as the measured differences between gamers and non-gamers in the study were marginal. The research was also discussed in relation to the gamergate controversy. However, Quandt and colleagues pointed out that their research does not necessarily prove the non-existence of sexism in specific gamer groups or the content itself, but that it rather supports the notion that gaming has become mainstream entertainment in modern societies thus approaching an average level of sexism.KotakuForbes In an interdisciplinary project on the analysis of social bots and their use in online propaganda, Quandt and colleagues develop computer-supported and automatic identification methods. During the project, they observed the German elections 2017. The team identified attempts at manipulating the public, including an unsuccessful Twitter attack on the electoral debate between chancellor Merkel and the social-democrat Schulz. The attackers were identified by journalists as a right-wing extremist group called Reconquista Germanica. Selected books * Kowert, R. & Quandt, T. (Eds.) (2015). The video game debate.

The original approach of having all youth that attended the in-school program also be cadet members in Civil Air Patrol was abandoned and it opened students to attend the STEM based in school class without having to commit to the traditional Civil Air Patrol Squadron and membership. This helped advance STEM and aviation into the school and garner interest in careers and institutions based in aviation. In November 2013, Lieutenant Colonel William Fitzpatrick, took over the squadron as the squadron commander. Immediately the focus, goals, mission and vision of the 811th changed substantially. Moving from a drill and ceremonies focused squadron, the 811th refocused on flight training, operational management, and aviation advocating. In 2014 the 811th received a Unit Citation for its contribution for standing up balloon operations and writing regulations for its integration at the national level. Hot Air Balloon Operations In October 2013, New Mexico Sunrise hit power lines, sending both the pilot and the crew chief to the hospital. After the accident, Mark Kilgore, the pilot and owner of the balloon donated it to the New Mexico Wing of Civil Air Patrol to develop a balloon program.http://www.abqjournal.com/278246/abqnewsseeker/balloon-hits-rio- rancho-power-line-two-men-burned.html The aircraft had been repaired and returned to air worthiness. At the time Major Ben Noyce spearheaded the acquisition of New Mexico Sunrise and renamed the aircraft Phoenix, since it had arisen from its own ashes to find a new purpose. Through intensive recruiting, the 811th gained three balloon pilots to help develop the balloon program. Captain Al Lowenstein as the Chief Pilot and Captain Jessica Makin, both became the first cadre and check pilots. The addition of Captain Will Manus brought the instructors up to three. The program began with an intense Chase Crew training program, which graduated over 40 members in the first 6 months.http://www.koat.com/news/cap-chase-crew-training/26939180#!beOHwz On the 25th of January, Major Ben Noyce was the first Civil Air Patrol member to receive his private pilot certificate solely through a Civil Air Patrol Balloon Flight Program. With crews trained, 811th members, furnishing member- owned aircraft flew a young 9-year old who is going blind, whose wish was to fly in a hot air balloon. https://sites.google.com/site/nmcapgroup800/news/abucketofdreams Cadets from the New Mexico Wing of Civil Air Patrol await a briefing before launching hot- air balloons at Albuquerque's Balloon Fiesta Park. The 811th realizing that the program could not be sustained unless they trained new pilots started to develop a full flight training program where five members, three senior members and two cadet members, began intensive initial flight training. Partnered with the local balloon community, the 811th provided chase crews and its own balloon to local rallies and events. Daniel Lovato, who was the crew chief for New Mexico Sunrise, was the other individual that was severely injured in the accident prior to CAP gaining the aircraft. In February 2015, Captain Lowenstein of the 811th flew Daniel Lovato for the first time after the accident in the same aircraft.http://www.abqjournal.com/539731/news/crash- survivor-to-fly-again.html Maj. William Fitzpatrick of the LBJ Middle School Cadet Squadron briefs New Mexico Wing cadets on the final day of the wing's first-ever hot air balloon clinic at Balloon Fiesta Park in Albuquerque. In June 2016, the balloon Phoenix was retired when it could no longer pass its annual airworthiness inspection. In the 18 months of operating with New Mexico Wing and starting the New Mexico Balloon Program, it produced five lighter than air pilots. Since Phoenix was retired, there was a need to find a replacement to continue the program. In October 2016, an order was placed with Lindstrand Balloons USA to build a custom envelope to replace the retired envelope of Phoenix. On December 27, 2016; New Mexico Wing took delivery of a ninety thousand cubic foot Lindstrand 90A Envelope named Integrity. Integrity Flew its first flight 8 January 8, 2016. Integrity has now participated in two Air Ventures in Oshkosh, Wisconsin and three Albuquerque International Balloon Fiestas. Integrity has exposed nearly 5 million people to Civil Air Patrol Balloon Operations while taking part in these events. First Cadet Lighter than Air Private Pilot in Southwest Region On February 26, 2016, the first cadet to attain her private pilot certificate for a hot air balloon within the Southwest Region of Civil Air Patrol. Lighter than Air training has been talked about within the organization for a few decades but documentation of completion is slim to none known. Cadet Blankley started her training in the summer of 2015, after completing her private pilot certificate in gliders. Raily Blankley, a member of the New Mexico Civil Air Patrol, holds the balloon opening as it is inflated. The New Mexico CAP's new balloon program allows members to participate in lighter-than-air flight while furthering their aerospace education. First Spaatz Award Recipient Cadet Colonel Destiny Maurer was the 2200 Cadet in the United States to receive her Spaatz Award. Earned on 7 August 2018, she is the first cadet in the 811th Cadet Squadron to receive the Spaatz Award and the 26th in the State of New Mexico.

The brand codes were transformed and galvanized. From 2003 to 2005, he takes on Guy Laroche's ready-to-wear collection. He reinvented the collections and dedicated himself mainly to the techniques of drapery. In 2006, he launches his own line of accessories and creates, amongst other things, luxurious alpaca scarves using ancestral techniques from the Andean plateaus. He reinvents scarves, wraps, capes and ponchos. All of his designs are inspired by the work of stitches and knitting.http://www.annuaire- createurs.fr/617-Octavio-Pizarro.html He wraps women up in the finest and most valued wool. ¬´ I like the idea of a woman wrapped up, nestled in my designs. ¬ª the designer declares. One article described his scarves as being ¬´ the most beautiful in the world ¬ª.Charlotte Laumonnier, ¬´ Octavio Pizarro : les plus belles √©charpes du monde ¬ª, Palace Costes, octobre-novembre 2010, p.79. His line of accessories is sold worldwide. Between 2006 and 2007, he created a collection of scarves that was noticed by Loulou de la Falaise.

He also made his collections well-known as a guest during the Catwalks of Budapest, Puerto Rico and in Santiago, Chile. In July 2015 he displayed his collection of ready-to-wear couture at the House of South America in Paris during Couture Fashion Week. November 2015, Octavio Pizarro has been rewarded with the ‚ÄúGrand Prix de la Cr√©ation‚Äù of the City of Paris in partnership with the French Federation of Pr√™t √† Porter F√©minin for his outstanding work especially for his knitting work. On April 21, 2016, Octavio Pizarro has launched his first capsule collection for the Falabella Department Store Group in Chile under the label ¬´ Octavio Pizarro pour Basement √©dition limit√©e ¬ª. The autumn/winter 2016 collection encompasses tailored pieces in the designer‚Äôs signature colour black, with touches of white and red, as well as original beautiful knitwear pieces. Octavio Pizarro has headed the Artistic Direction on every major step of the project including the design of the Advertising campaigns, the shopfit of the corners, the design of the POS materials along with the promotion of the project with the press.

The models showed 28 original pieces to 300 guests including the Chilean socialite crowd, the major press journalist and press stylists. The collection is distributed in the 4 main Santiago Falabella stores, Alto las Codes, Parque Arauco, La Dehesa and Costanera Center. Style It is during his trips in the north of Chile and Peru that Octavio Pizarro got interested in Alpaca wool and its blending with other material. This traditional material in link with his cultural roots will then be the object of his aesthetic researches.Patrice Farameh, Young Fashion Designers Americas:Daab Media, 2008, p.271. He is one of the first fashion designers to use it for his creations. He discovered two ways to work the wool: handmade in order to enhance the authentic aspect of traditional work around wool; and using Jacquard and incrustation to skilfully sculpt the body with perfect finishing touches. He likes playing around with the contrast between material and techniques. He is looking for ¬´ mixing the extremes ¬ª. Thus, we can see Alpaca wool incrusted with Swarovski crystals, the mix between leather and fur. The chic and the look of his lines are reinforced by the play on the geometric shapes, the graphic prints and transparencies The choice of colour used by Octavio Pizarro is representative of his identity and of his Franco- Chilean heritage. He plays around with natural tones. ‚ÄúMy colour code is composed of black, white, grey ‚Ä¶ And I am also very much attracted by strong, flashy colours such as lime green, yellow, dark red...‚Äù The density of the black defines his chromatic sphere, the way Soulages used to paint. Inspired by his trips and the people he has met, the geometry of abstract lines and the Art deco style, Octavio Pizarro creates for a resolutely modern woman. ¬´ I like dressing women with personality, who feel beautiful, who like being watched, which is to say ¬´ una mujer salvaje ¬ª. In summary, he suggests an enchanting vision of a woman, ¬´ free, sensual and who isn't scared to show it ¬ª.:fr:Octavio Pizarro See also *Diane Pernet  References  External links *  Further reading   * * Category:French fashion designers Category:Living people Category:Luxury brands Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Octavio Pizarro"},{"id":"48414307","text":"Gary Rowland Myers (born January 1, 1944) is an American attorney and politician who specializes in military law.

It stars Vishal and Catherine Tresa. Co-produced by both Pandiraj and Vishal, the film follows a man who gets blamed for the murder of a local don due to their enmity, and must now evade everyone trying to catch him. Kathakali released on 14 January 2016. The Telugu dubbed version with the same title was released on 18 March 2016. A Hindi dubbed version titled Khel Power Ka was also released in 2017 via Zee Cinema.  Plot  Amudhavel (Vishal), after spending six years in the United States, returns to Cuddalore for his marriage to his long-time girlfriend Meenu Kutty (Catherine Tresa). He is forced to invite to his marriage a local don named Lakshmipathy aka Thamba (Madhusudhan Rao), despite a previous history between them. Thamba was responsible for dragging Amudhan and his elder brother Gnanavel Rajarathinam (Mime Gopi) to jail five years ago on a false charge after Gnanavel, who worked in Thamba's fishing business, decided to leave Thamba and start his own fishing business. Thamba was also responsible for chopping off the leg of Amudhan and Gnanavel's father Rajarathinam when he had tried to intervene in the fight between Thamba and his sons, confining him to a wheelchair. To escape from Thamba and his gang and not cause any more harm to his family, Amudhan had emigrated to the US. While Amudhan is in Chennai doing wedding shopping with Meenu Kutty, he gets the news that Thamba had been killed the previous day. Unfortunately for Amudhan, he is soon suspected of murdering Thamba due to their enmity. Thamba's henchmen set Amudhan's house on fire, forcing Gnanavel and his family to go into hiding. Inspector Saravana Vadivel (Sreejith Ravi), a cruel and merciless police officer, is assigned to bring Thamba's killer to justice. Since Amudhan is the prime suspect, Vadivel orders him to present himself at Cuddalore the next day and prove his innocence, failing which he will be considered as Thamba's murderer and will be thrown into jail. Amudhan leaves for Cuddalore at midnight, with policemen heavily guarding the bus and route in which he is travelling to prevent him from escaping. Amudhan manages to escape from the police at Puducherry and meets up with Gnanavel and his family. Amudhan and Gnanavel then leave for Cuddalore to meet Vadivel. They soon find out that Vadivel has no intention of hearing their story and is determined to throw them into prison. They escape from Vadivel and the police. Meenu Kutty is forced to sit in the police station by Vadivel as he hopes that Amudhan will take the blame for the murder to protect his fianc√©. While on the run, Amudhan finds out that Vadivel is behind Thamba's death. He then overpowers Thamba's brothers-in-law and Vadivel, as well as his teenage son, and holds them hostage to find out the truth. Vadivel had been humiliated in front of his wife by Thamba, because of which he had decided to take revenge on Thamba by sending men to kill him and then framing his death on Amudhan, since he seemed easy to frame and also because of the history between Thamba and Amudhan. Amudhan confronts Vadivel, forcing him to reveal that he was Thamba's murderer. However, both Thamba's brothers-in-law were also involved in the murder as they wanted to usurp Thamba's position. They then fight with Amudhan, with one of the brothers-in-law killed by his own man by accident. Vadivel is also brutally attacked by Amudhan. Unfortunately for Vadivel and the other brother-in-law, Thamba's teenage son had overheard their confession regarding the murder, and he kills both his uncle and Vadivel with a metal silencer. In the end, it is revealed to the audience that though Vadivel and Thamba's in-laws had plotted to kill Thamba, the real murderer of Thamba was Amudhan. Amudhan, who was determined to take revenge against Thamba for the atrocities that he committed against him and his family, had stabbed Thamba and escaped before Vadivel's men arrived and further stabbed a dying Thamba to death.

In 2009, after Hapoel Umm al-Fahm folded, an informal union was formed between the managements of Hapoel and Ironi Sayid, in order to keep the name of Hapoel active.

At the end of the season, the club topped its division, but was deducted six points after it was convicted in attempted match fixing, as one of its players contacted a player from local rivals Maccabi Ironi Jatt, who were also aiming for promotion, and offered him several benefits in exchange for throwing the match between the teams.U.E.

It has since grown in popularity, and as of 2018 has become a dominant hardware modular synthesizer format, with over 5000 modules available from more than 270 different manufacturers ranging from DIY kits and boutique, cottage-industry designers to well-known, established synth mass-manufacturers like Moog and Roland. Compact size, 3.5mm mono jacks and cables for patching all signals, and lack of a visual or sonic aesthetic defined by one manufacturer sets Eurorack apart from other modular synthesizer formats, and these factors have contributed to the popularity of Eurorack among both manufacturers and musicians.  History  upright=1.5 Before Eurorack, in the late 1970s, several modular systems based on the industrial ‚ÄúEuro‚Äù card frames appeared: * Elektor Formant (3u or 6u x 7HP, 3.5mm jacks, 31 pin bus, +/-15v) * BME PM10/Axiom (3u x 8HP, phono/rca jacks, 31 pin bus, +/-15v) * The Synton 3000 (3u x 8HP, 4mm ‚Äúbanana‚Äù jacks, +/-15v) was of similar format, but constructed more like a modern Eurorack synth. By the late 1980s, these had all ceased production. Dieter D√∂pfer built some Formant modules before producing his own systems. His Voice Modular System from the early 1980s was a Eurocard-based \\"modular\\" (the modules were non-patchable voice cards etc.) polyphonic synth, but the front panels look very similar to the later A100 modules. In 1996, Doepfer Musikelektronik released the first Eurorack-format modular synthesizer system, the Doepfer A-100, followed by successive new series of compatible modules in 1997 and 1998. In the UK, Analogue Systems had been independently developing a very similar format, with small technical differences such as the power connectors. Analogue Systems would later change their products to offer Eurorack compatibility. In the mid 2000s, other manufacturers such as Cwejman, Make Noise Music and TipTop Audio adopted Doepfer's Eurorack format and started designing and manufacturing compatible modules. By 2013, the Eurorack format had gained in popularity. Music technology journalists estimated that there were already at least 80 manufacturers offering over 700 modules, greatly expanding the musical possibilities available from a Eurorack system to include sampling and sample manipulation, West-coast-style wavefolding, DSP-based effects and more. In the mid 2010s, increasing interest in Eurorack modulars prompted large, well-known music technology manufacturers to start producing Eurorack-compatible equipment aimed at this new market. In addition to modules, manufacturers like Arturia started producing outboard devices such as the Beatstep and Microbrute designed to be able to communicate with Eurorack modular synthesizers via 3.5mm jacks transmitting control voltages. In 2015 Moog released the Mother 32, a Eurorack-compatible semi-modular synthesizer. By the end of fall 2018, the ModularGrid website included more than 316 manufacturers . Specifications upright=1.5 For synthesizers, Eurorack is a de facto standard to allow different modules to fit in the same cases and communicate among themselves. The basic requirement is compatibility with the Doepfer technical specifications: * Mechanical: A100 Construction Details * Electrical: A100 Technical Details = Physical = The physical specification is based on the Eurocard standard of: * 3U (5.25inches or 133.4mm), where height \\"U\\" is measured in rack units, rounded for a lip. * 1HP (0.2inches or 5.08mm), where width \\"HP\\" is measured in horizontal pitch units. A card width is generally integer multiples of 1HP, although some manufactures work in multiples of 0.5HP. Eurorack modules may be further characterized by depth: shallow modules (2.5cm to 4cm) can fit into \\"skiff\\" cases and are casually referred to as \\"skiff friendly\\". = Electrical = Eurorack defines a common power supply and power connector: a 10- or 16-pin ribbon cable supplying a dual rail 12v DC power supply. Power connectors can also include a 5V DC power supply, and CV and Gate buses. Audio and control signals are exchanged between modules via 3.5mm mono jack cables. The electrical characteristics of signals are split into three loosely defined categories: * Audio signals are typically a maximum of 10V peak-to-peak (i.e. between -5V and +5V) * Control voltages can either be unipolar or bipolar. Bipolar control voltages are typically 5V peak-to-peak (i.e. from -2.5V to +2.5V), unipolar voltages between 0V and 8V. The V/Octave scale is used for pitch information * Trigger, Gate or Clock signals are digital 0V to 5V pulses typically used for timing and event signalling. = 1U Modules = upright=1.5 Several manufacturers offer Eurorack-compatible modules in a smaller 1U tall format, sometimes referred to as \\"tiles\\". As of 2018 there are two competing standards for 1U modules, differing mainly in their height. 1U modules manufactured by Intellijel are 39.65mm high, whereas 1U modules manufactured by Pulp Logic and other manufacturers are 43.2mm high. Pulp Logic also proposes a more compact power connector for 1U modules, consisting of only three pins.  DIY and open source  A completed Sonic Potions DIY Eurorack module kit The technical and modular nature of Eurorack often attracts people who are interested in modifying or building their own modules or cases. Many Eurorack manufacturers started off as individuals building \\"do it yourself\\" (DIY) modules or offering DIY kits before expanding into production. Building DIY modules can be a gateway to learning more about electronics and physical manufacturing, as well as being satisfying and developing a more intimate connection with the synthesizer as a personal musical instrument. Some manufacturers such as Befaco, Bastl Instruments and Erica Synths offer some or all of their modules both as assembled products or as kits to be assembled by the buyer. Doepfer offers a case and power supply kit, as well as 'low cost' cases designed to be customised and finished by the buyer. Releasing modules exclusively as open source designs and DIY kits allows designers such as Music Thing Modular to design and release popular modules such as the Turing Machine or Radio Music without having to run a company or invest in manufacturing. Open Source licenses for both hardware and code allow individuals to build the modules from scratch, and companies such as Thonk to offer kits. Some manufacturers do not offer kits or intend for end users to build their products, but release the code, schematics and layout under open source licenses. √âmilie Gillet of Mutable Instruments cites transparency and the possibility for customers to customise or modify their modules as driving reasons for this decision.

It is located in downtown Wartrace, Tennessee, and is a part of the Wartrace Historic District. The hotel is in business as such, and also contains the Strolling Jim Restaurant, named for the original owner's World Grand Championship-winning show horse. History The Walking Horse Hotel was first built in 1917 as a railroad hotel, and was named the Hotel Overall. In 1933, the Hotel Overall was purchased by Floyd and Olive Carothers. In the late 1930s, it was the base for a group of horse trainers, who eventually created the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, an annual horse show held for the first time in 1939. Because of this, the name was changed to the Walking Horse Hotel. The first winner of the Celebration, Strolling Jim, who was owned and trained by Floyd Carothers, is buried behind the hotel. Since 2015, the Tennessee Walking Horse National Museum has had a framed portrait of Strolling Jim on display. Floyd Carothers died in 1944, but the hotel was owned and operated by Olive Carothers until 1958. The building was sold several times, then renovated in 1995 and reopened as the Hotel Overall. It was closed several years later, renovated again by current owner Joe Peters, and reopened in 2007 with the Walking Horse name. True to its history, the hotel retains many Walking Horse-related artifacts, particularly in the Strolling Jim Restaurant. Modern day The hotel was renovated in 2007, and now includes the Chais Music Lounge, named for the owner's late wife, and the Strolling Jim Restaurant, which serves three meals a day. The hotel has seven rooms available for rent. Hauntings Every fall from late September to Halloween, the Walking Horse Hotel is open to the public as a haunted attraction. It is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Floyd Carothers, and in 1995 some guests reported seeing the ghost of Strolling Jim \\"prancing\\" around by his old stables behind the hotel. Paranormal activity is supposed to have dropped, however, after Olive Carothers, Floyd's widow, died in 1991. In May 2016, the second floor of the hotel caught fire. It and the third floor sustained smoke and water damage but were mostly unharmed.http://www.wgnsradio.com/historic-walking-horse-hotel-catches-fire- in-wartrace-cms-32738 In popular culture =Television= The Walking Horse Hotel was featured on an episode of My Ghost Story. The segment was titled \\"Dead Horse Walking\\". It aired on the Travel Channel in 2012. The hotel was also showcased as a haunted location on Haunted Live in 2018 as the Tennessee Wraith Chasers investigated the hotel live with viewers through social media. The episode aired on the Travel Channel.

He is the Academic Director of the Transformative Innovation Policy Consortium (TIPC) and former Director of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex. He was elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) in 2009.  Biography  After his studies at Erasmus University Rotterdam, Schot became a consultant in 1985 at the TNO Centre for Technology and Policy Studies. He completed his Phd at the University of Twente in 1991 on the 'Societal Shaping of Technical Change: Constructive Technology Assessment as a form of Luddism' and then he served as an Assistant Professor, then Associate Professor at Twente until 1999. He was made part-time Professor in the Social History of Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology in 1998 and subsequently at Twente in 1999. In 2002 the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research awarded him a research grant under the Innovational Research Incentives scheme for talented scholars (highest category) to establish his own research program. In 2003 he was appointed full-time Professor in the History of Technology/Transitions Studies at the Eindhoven University of Technology. From September 2010 until July 2011 he worked as a fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Wassenaar, writing and editing a six-volume book series. The book series entitled Making Europe: Technology and Transformation 1850-2000, was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2013. In January 2014, Johan Schot was appointed Director of the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex.

Accessed November 5, 2015 for his outstanding contribution to the history of technology.Johan Schot receives award for outstanding contribution to history of technology In January 2019, Johan Schot returned to the Netherlands to start his new role as Professor in Global Comparative HistoryJohan Schot appointed Professor in Global Comparative History at the Centre for Global Challenges at Utrecht University.  Research  Professor Schot's current research focuses on the conceptualisation and historical interpretation of Deep Transitions. Such transitions refer to long term change processes which transform the economy and society. The First Deep Transition started in 1750 and resulted in the welfare state. The Second Deep Transition started somewhere in the 1970s and is transforming capitalism and modernity as we know it. Building upon the insights of Christopher Freeman and Carlota Perez, the aim is to develop a new version of the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) of Sustainability Transitions that is able to capture the nature and dynamics of Deep Transitions. Professor Schot will also use this new theory to generate insights for the governance of new transition pathways. In this research, Professor Schot builds upon his ability to draw insights from the history of technology, evolutionary economics, as well as science and technology studies. In the past, he was instrumental in developing and extending the niche theory of radical change into the influential MLP on sustainability transitions, working with Arie Rip, Frank Geels and others. He was also key in establishing a new framework for research and policy around sustainable technologies, called Strategic Niche Management, building on his earlier influential work on the Constructive Technology Assessment framework. In addition, Professor Schot has co-developed a range of new concepts for the contextual history of technology, such as the mediation junction, the innovation junction, technocratic internationalism, and the hidden integration and fragmentation of Europe. Johan Schot's work has greatly benefited from an emphasis on creative collaborations across borders and disciplines which open up innovative new research agendas. He has created and pioneered large scale collaborations, in which many (up to 100 or more) scholars and practitioners from business, government and societal groups work productively together. Initiatives such as the Greening of Industry Network and the influential Dutch Knowledge Network for System Innovations and Transitions have all successfully enabled the development of innovative new insights and transformative practices. More recently, the Tensions of Europe collaboration of up to 300 scholars resulted in the dynamic ‚ÄòInventing Europe‚Äô digital history project, delivered in partnership with ten cultural heritage institutions and museums. This transnational collaboration also led to a unique book series, called ‚ÄòMaking Europe‚Äô, which provides new interpretations of European History through the lens of technology.  Books  = Making Europe = Edited by Johan Schot and Philip Scranton of Rutgers University (USA), the Making Europe book series investigates the question of ‚ÄòWho built Europe?‚Äô by charting the people and ideas, goods and technologies that spread between countries‚Äî and between continents. It is the result of a collective effort of an international team of authors and researchers, initiated in 1999 by researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology and the Dutch Foundation for the History of Technology.

The prize is awarded by EASST in honour of Chris Freeman, founder of SPRU. = Technology and the Making of the Netherlands = This book, which synthesizes findings originally presented in a series of seven volumes published in the Netherlands, uses the idea of contested modernization as an overarching concept through which to understand Dutch technological history. The modernizers of Dutch society‚Äîincluding engineers, management consultants, architects, and others‚Äîdid not always agree on how to modernize; moreover, the unruliness of specific practices often derailed or redirected implementation. Tensions between top-down and bottom-up modernization, and between scale- enlargement and more flexible arrangements of mutual coordination and cooperation shaped Dutch history. The chapters examine such topics as attempts to create an industrial nation, new infrastructures; the coming of mass production and the emergence of a consumer society; and land-use planning in a low-lying country.

Managerial career in basketball With Ben Kerner, Ferris founded the Buffalo Bisons, which played in the National Basketball League in 1946. The Bisons evolved into the Tri- Cities Blackhawks, based in Moline, Illinois, which eventually became the Milwaukee Hawks, the St. Louis Hawks, and finally today's Atlanta Hawks. He signed Pop Gates, one of the first two African-American players in the NBL, in 1946. \\"When Leo Ferris came to me, it was like a godsend,\\" Pop Gates was quoted as saying in the book, \\"Pioneers of the Hardwood: Indiana and the Birth of Professional Basketball.\\" \\"It was a real highlight of my career to be accepted by the NBL as one of only two blacks in the league.\\" He later became NBL vice president and president and helped orchestrate its eventual merger with the Basketball Association of America, forming what would become today's NBA. Indiana sportswriter John Whitaker called Ferris the most influential owner in basketball, the ‚Äúminister, ring bearer, best man‚Äù at what Whitaker described as ‚Äúthe shotgun wedding‚Äù that created the NBA. The Syracuse Nationals' \\"recipe for success\\" began by recruiting Leo F. Ferris, then a talented team executive to reorganize the Syracuse team. Acting in capacity of NBL Vice President and then as general manager of the Nationals, Ferris first moves included signing Dolph Schayes, Al Cervi & Billy Gabor to the roster which put in place the core of the club that took three trips NBA Finals and captured the 1955 NBA title. Leo F. Ferris Concerns about a fan-unfriendly slow pace led to discussion of adding a shot clock to NBA games, adding possessions and excitement. Ferris and Danny Biasone ‚Äî owner of the Syracuse Nationals, where Ferris was general manager ‚Äî are often given credit for the selection of 24 seconds, though there is evidence Ferris may deserve the lion's share. Ferris became the first general manager in basketball to organize celebrity halftime shows and brought acts like Bob Hope, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Sarah Vaugh, Duke Ellington, and others to perform in Syracuse. Many of them provided halftime entertainment for the Syracuse Nationals home games. Ferris was successful boosting attendance and expanded the possibilities of the types of entertainment one could enjoy at a basketball game. \\"Get an attractive ‚Äòpackage‚Äô, and put it within reach of the greatest possible number of customers. Satisfy the fans, and you have a steady, and increasing, following. That's what pro basketball is doing.\\" Later career Ferris left sports in 1955 and entered the real estate business. He died in 1993, at age 76 of Huntington's disease. Halls of Fame Ferris has been nominated four times to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, in 2016, 2017., 2018 & 2019 by the Veterans Committee but is yet to be inducted. Ferris is a member of three regional sports halls of fame: The Greater Syracuse Sports Hall of Fame, Chemung County Sports Hall of Fame, and the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame.

His art has been inspired by the Langhe's nature, animals, plants, and rich flavours. Many among his refined and detailed engravings became labels on wine bottles for some of the Langhe's famous wine producers, who also happened to be Gallo's friends . Dogliani and the Langhe are renowned for the production of Barolo, Dolcetto, other well-known wines as well as grappas . Gallo's labels were seminal in that, together with few other artists, he launched the idea of ‚Äúartistic labels‚Äù. After studying engineering at the Turin Polytechnic, Gallo returned to Dogliani and befriended artists such as Claudio Bonichi and Eso Peluzzi, who were also familiar with that part of Piedmont. However, Gallo refrained from participating in major events and exhibitions and preferred spending his artistic life in the quest for ever newer forms of representing lines and images related to his own land and experience. Gallo was also interested in football and politics, and dedicated time to cuisine and his family's farm in Dogliani. Gallo died in 2011 in Cuneo.

It also inhabits farmland, open woodland, grassland and gardens. It is usually seen further inland than the collared kingfisher, where it was previously considered conspecific, ranging into forest or into mountain areas. Birds often perch conspicuously on wires, rocks or bare branches.

Feeding Small crabs are the favoured food in coastal regions but a wide variety of other animals are eaten including insects, worms, snails, shrimps, frogs, lizards, small fish and sometimes other small birds as well. The bird perches almost motionless for long periods waiting for prey. When it spots something it glides down to catch it and then flies back to the perch where larger items are pounded against the branch to subdue them. Any indigestible remains are regurgitated as pellets. Reproduction The nest is a hole, either a natural tree hole or a burrow excavated by the birds themselves in a rotten tree, termite mound or earth bank. They will also occupy old woodpecker holes. Two to seven rounded whitish eggs are laid directly on the floor of the burrow with no nest material used. Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The young birds leave the nest about 44 days after hatching. Two broods are often raised in a year. References * Heinrich L.

Staurakios Platys is only mentioned by the De Administrando Imperio, a work compiled in the middle of the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos. According to it, in approximately 909/910, he was the commander (katepano) of the Mardaites in the maritime Cibyrrhaeot Theme in southern Asia Minor. He clashed with Eustathios, the ek prosopou (or possibly the strategos) of the theme, over jurisdictional matters, although both were proteges of the powerful logothetes tou dromou, Himerios. Eustathios wrote to the emperor Leo VI the Wise with various accusations against Staurakios, and succeeded in having the latter recalled and his authority transferred to himself. If he had not been dismissed by that time, it is possible that Staurakios is the nameless katepano of the Mardaites who was charged with providing crews and funds for Himerios' great naval expedition in 911, directed against the Emirate of Crete or the coasts of Syria. 5,087 Mardaites from the Cibyrrhaeot Theme were reportedly involved.

Alongside its equivalent in Helsinki, Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors (1844-1974), it was the first state school for females in Finland. From 1919, it was called Svenska flickskolan i √Öbo (Swedish Girls' School in √Öbo). History The sister schools of √Öbo and Helsinki were founded as a result of a debate about women's education in Finland. Already in 1793, Jakob Tengstr√∂m in √Öbo Tidningar criticized the schools for girls in Finland for being shallow and useless, and called for girls to be given a more useful education. At that point, the only schools open to females were temporary schools managed by single women who educated upper class students in various accomplishments, such as French and music, with the purpose of becoming \\"ladies\\", wives and mothers, such as those of Christina Krook, Anna Salmberg and Sara Wacklin. This debate resulted in the decision that girls should be included in the reform of the school system in 1843, and the following year, the Svenska fruntimmersskolan i √Öbo was founded in √Öbo, and the Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors in Helsinki. The school was founded and financed by the state, after the example of the Fruntimmersskolan i Viborg, and it was followed by similar private schools in smaller cities in Finland in the following decades, especially after the school reform of 1856, often referred to by the name \\"fruntimmersskolan\\" in their respective cities, and with a similar pattern. Initially, the school was reserved for Swedish speaking students from the upper- and middle classes, the Swedish language being the language of the upper classes in Finland. It was placed under the supervision of the Lutheran archbishop of Finland, and the education was focused on education the students in subjects considered suitable for women: a large proportion of the lessons were focused on handicrafts, and during lessons by a male teacher, the students were chaperoned in the class room by a female assistant. After Maria Tschetschulin was accepted as the first woman university student in Finland in 1870, the character of the education changed, and eventually serious secondary education classes were introduced to prepare girls for university. In 1870, the supervision of the church was abolished, in 1872, the demand that all students must be members of the Swedish speaking upper classes was dropped. When the dispensation for female university students was dropped and women were accepted at the same terms as men in 1915, girls and boys started to receive the same education in the school system, and the girls' schools in Finland started to be changed to coeducation, a development which was completed in the 1970s. In 1955, the Svenska fruntimmersskolan i √Öbo was closed, merged with its rival, Heurlinska Skolan from 1861, at that time the largest girl school in Finland, and became the √Öbo Svenska Flicklyceum, which in turn was merged with the Katedralskolan i √Öbo 1971.

In 2012, she founded Tahrir Bodyguard, a movement comprising uniformed volunteers to protect women from the mob sexual assaults in Tahrir Square.  Early life  Bahgat was born in Finland to Egyptian parents. Her family moved to Egypt when she was seven years old.Soraya Bahgat kantaa vastuuta Egyptist√§ Global.finland Tahrir Bodyguard While at the office and on the way to Tahrir Square to join mass protests, Soraya Bahgat decided to launch Tahrir Bodyguard following a panic attack over safety concerns amidst the ongoing mob sexual assaults. Recognizing the power of Twitter, she immediately took to the site to start an account and started tweeting safety tips and calls for volunteers. In an interview with The Atlantic she stated that she was overwhelmed by the account‚Äôs immediate reach, with over 600 followers during the first 2 hours. She recruited a core group of trusted individuals to help her build the movement‚Äôs foundations and recruit the volunteers. She started by purchasing 200 uniforms comprising construction helmets and neon vests and soon enough the group managed to recruit the needed volunteers. The volunteers' uniforms comprising construction helmets and neon vests were intended to protect the volunteers and make them easily visible at night. Tahir Bodyguard operated in two ways. First, the group proactively patrolled Tahrir Square and its surroundings to protect the women and identify areas where assaults could occur. Second, the group engaged with the mobs to free women being assaulted and take them to ambulances stationed outside the square. At the beginning, she was anonymous and gave an interview to Gawker in December 2012 using a pseudonym. In February 2013, her name and occupation were revealed in a profile by the Associated Press. During down times where there was no activity in Tahrir Square, the group offered free self-defense classes for women to empower them to own the streets. Women‚Äôs Advocacy and Community Engagement She is a member of the Strategic Advisory Group of The Girl Generation, the Africa-led movement to end female genital mutilation in one generation. Italian-Egyptian model, actress and philanthropist Elisa Sednaoui has named her as a friend and collaborator on her foundation‚Äôs website. In 2014, Soraya became one of the nonprofit organization‚Äôs trustees promoting creative learning through special after-school programs for disadvantaged youngsters in Egypt and other countries. Between 2008 and 2012, she served on the board of the Gezira Youth Center. Public Appearances Together with her Tahrir Bodyguard colleagues she appeared in a France 24 documentary by French journalist Sonia Dridi entitled ‚ÄúSexual harassment, an Egyptian disease\\". The documentary which included interviews with Mona Eltahawy and other Egyptian activists closely followed the Tahrir Bodyguard team during their preparations and as they patrolled the vicinity of Tahrir Square. In March 2013, Soraya appeared alongside Harassmap‚Äôs Ebaa El-Tamami in a special episode of the widely popular show Al Bernameg hosted by Bassem Youssef . The episode was fully dedicated to tackling the issue of sexual harassment of women in Egypt and utilized humor and satire to dispel many of the misconceptions about the topic, especially those that place the blame on women. In May 2013, Soraya gave a speech on women in Egypt at the Oslo Freedom Forum entitled ‚ÄúThe voice of a woman is a revolution‚Äù. In her speech she described the courage that women showed in protesting alongside men during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and denounced the attacks and harassment they have faced since then. She also highlighted the pandemic of mob sexual assaults in Tahrir Square and the various efforts by civilians to combat these assaults. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre putting up a fight, we‚Äôre not afraid,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhen they tried to silence Egyptian women, we became even more defiant.‚Äù Following her speech, she participated in a panel discussion entitled \\"women under threat‚Äù that also included Lebanese journalist Jenan Moussa, British journalist and barrister Afua Hirsch and co- founder and assistant executive director of the Panzi Foundation USA Lee Ann De Reus. The panel discussion was moderated by BBC television Newsreader and journalist Philippa Thomas.

Mainline trackage =Gauge= median of Allen Road The TTC's heavy rail linesLines 1, 2, and 4are built to the unique Toronto gauge of , which is the same gauge used on the city's streetcar system. However, the light metro Line 3 Scarborough uses standard-gauge track, as will two under-construction light rail lines: Line 5 Eglinton and Line 6 Finch West. =Tunnels= Tunnels are either square or round, depending on the method of their construction: Square tunnels were built with the cut and cover method of digging trenches down from the surface, constructing the tunnel structure, and then backfilling. Round tunnels are bored using a tunnel boring machine (TBM). The cut and cover technique was used extensively on the oldest portions of the subway system, while newer sections were predominantly or, in the case of the Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension (TYSSE), which opened in 2017, entirely bored. Some sections of track run on the surface, the most notable on the heavy rail subway system being the stretch of Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity in the median of Allen Road. However, the light metro Line 3 is a surface or elevated route for nearly its entire length. Diamond crossovers Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station with a departing train crossing between the northbound platform and the southbound track Surface crossover at station Diamond crossovers (or \\"scissors crossovers\\") are X-shaped track assemblies that are used, particularly at terminal stations, to allow trains to reverse direction and enter the opposite track. They also exist outside some through stations (mostly those that were former terminal stations) where they are often used to short turn trains. A single-crossover just east of Union Station is what remains of the former diamond-crossover, which was used when the station marked the southern terminus of the original line. A few crossover tracks that were built as part of the original subway system have since been removed; their locations are marked by tunnel sections where there are no central pillars between tracks. Crossovers are found in the vicinity of the following stations: * Yonge‚ÄìUniversity line **South of Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (terminal station) **South of **South of **South of (formerly Downsview Station; terminus between 1996‚Äì2017) **South of (original Spadina line terminus between 1978‚Äì1996) **North of **South of (original University line terminus between 1963‚Äì1966 and 1966‚Äì1978) **East of (on northbound track; formerly a double crossover, now a single crossover; original south Yonge line terminus between 1954‚Äì1963) **North of , south of **North of , south of **North of Bloor **South of **South of (original north Yonge line terminus between 1954‚Äì1973) **South of **South of **South of (terminal station) * Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line **East of (terminal station) **East of (terminal station between 1968‚Äì1980) **East of **East of (part of original west Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line terminus between 1966‚Äì1968) **East of **West of (part of original east Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line terminus between 1966‚Äì1968) **East of **West of (terminal station between 1968‚Äì1980) **West of (terminal station) * Scarborough line **East of Kennedy (on southbound track) (terminal station) **West of (terminal station) * Sheppard line **East and west of Sheppard‚ÄìYonge (terminal station) **East of **West of (terminal station) =Notes= Storage tracks or centre tracks The centre storage track (visible at left) north of Finch West Station Centre tracks allow a train to enter from either end into a third set of tracks, longer than the length of a standard train, between the two service tracks. Trains can either layover or short turn there, allowing other trains to pass them by, or reverse direction from this position with minimal interference with through trains compared to crossovers, which requires the reversal to take place on station platforms. Sometimes, regular trains are diverted into centre tracks when there is track maintenance on one of the service tracks. Pocket tracks are a variation on the centre track, accessible only from one end. Storage/centre tracks are found in the vicinity of the following stations: * Yonge‚ÄìUniversity line **North of Finch West **South of **North of **South of (accessible from north end only) **Between and Union **North of Eglinton (accessible from south end only) **South of (terminal station between 1973‚Äì1974; constructed in place of a diamond crossover) **North of Finch (third tail track) * Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line **East of Islington **East of **West of * Scarborough line **There are no centre tracks or storage tracks on Line 3. * Sheppard line **There are no centre tracks or storage tracks on Line 4. Other track features The west (southbound side) tail track at Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station. Note the trackless tunnel section for a potential third tail track at right.The unusually short tail track at station Track configurations become more complicated where lines meet (at the Spadina‚ÄìSt. George‚ÄìMuseum‚ÄìBay‚ÄìYonge junction and at Sheppard‚ÄìYonge), and at the entrances to subway yards. Tracks usually continue for roughly the length of a train beyond the last station on a line; these are known as tail tracks. The only exception to this is at Don Mills Station, where the tail tracks are less than two cars in length. This is likely because storage capacity is available at Sheppard‚ÄìYonge, which can store enough trains to service the line. The tail track structures at some terminal or former terminal stations also have, or have provisions for, a third tail track. Finch Station has such a triple configuration, Vaughan Metropolitan Centre Station is a terminal station with an trackless tunnel section for installation of a potential third tail track, and Sheppard West Station was a formal terminal also built with a trackless third tunnel north of it, which could now accommodate a future standard pocket track. Other track features that exist include the following: The Bloor Wye was used for interlining in 1966: *North of Museum station, the tracks split, with the Line 1 mainline leading west to St. George station (upper), and the other east to Bay lower (abandoned a few months later in late 1966). *The eastbound track from Bay lower joins the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line just before Yonge station while the westbound track from Bay lower turns and meets the southbound track just north of Museum station. *The eastbound tracks approaching St. George Station from Spadina on the Bloor-Danforth line split, with one heading for St. George lower and the other heading for St. George upper. *The westbound track headed to Spadina Station west of St. George upper now includes a switch that allows trains to run to Spadina Station on the Spadina line, which was built more than a decade after the interlining trial was completed. The tracks used for access to yards: *Single cross-overs act as entrances and exits to Keele, Wilson, and Davisville subway yards. *The Greenwood Wye between Donlands and Greenwood stations allows both east and westbound trains to route south to the Greenwood Yard. *An access track leading west to Wilson Yard south of Sheppard West station from the southbound direction, defaulting from the crossover track section leading to/from the station's northbound platform. Trains needing to access the yard from the south must reverse at the station (from either side of the island platform ) or access it from the crossover north of Wilson station. *A maintenance track, accessible from the eastbound track on the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line, just west of Warden Station. Trains must run in reverse to access this siding The Sheppard Wye includes the following features: *Northbound Yonge line to eastbound Sheppard line: track switch on the Yonge Line that meets the Sheppard line east of Sheppard‚ÄìYonge station *Westbound Sheppard line to southbound Yonge line: west of Sheppard‚ÄìYonge station on the Sheppard line storage tracks and switches allow trains to proceed from east to south connecting with the southbound Yonge line just south of Sheppard‚ÄìYonge station Each of the three subway yards have different features that join them to the mainline. Subway operators generally get their train at a point where the yard meets the main line, at the Greenwood Portal, the Davisville Buildup (third platform of Davisville Station), or the Wilson Hostler (platform-like in appearance seen heading between Wilson and Sheppard West stations on the east side of the yard) depending on the home yard. Tracking from Union to Eglinton stations is aging and there is a proposal to upgrade trackbed from Eglinton to St. Clair stations to improve service, but could result in service interruptions.

It premiered on Showtime on December 6, 2015.  Plot  Saul (Mandy Patinkin) is absolved when Krupin (Mark Ivanir) admits that the Russians orchestrated the bombing of General Youssef's plane. Carrie (Claire Danes) and Saul are convinced of Allison's (Miranda Otto) guilt, and become frustrated when Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) refuses to make a final judgment without more evidence. Dar also suggests to Saul that quietly shuffling Allison down the ranks of the CIA might be a better solution politically than the massive scandal that would erupt if it was exposed that a Russian agent had risen to CIA station chief. Saul attempts to get a confession out of Allison, but when recounting the deaths of CIA colleagues he believes to be attributable to Allison, he explodes in rage at her and is taken away by security. Bibi Hamed (Ren√© Ifrah) releases a video to the public in which he demands that the UNSC officially recognize the Islamic State, or he will unleash a chemical attack on a major European city in 24 hours. Also included is footage of the effects of the sarin gas on Quinn (Rupert Friend). Carrie and Astrid (Nina Hoss), assuming Quinn to have been killed by the gas, repeatedly watch the grisly video looking for clues to where it was recorded. They make note of a mosaic on the floor which the BND is able to trace to a specific artist. Laura (Sarah Sokolovic) and Jonas (Alexander Fehling) interview a suspected jihadist, Faisal Marwan, who was freed by the German government along with Zayd. Faisal is looking to file a suit against the German government. Faisal also reveals that Zayd told him about an attack in Berlin. Unsure of what to do with the info, Otto (Sebastian Koch) calls Saul for help. He agrees to turn over Faisal but asks Saul to guarantee his safety. Faisal is captured by BND agents once he leaves the building. Bibi learns that an empty container of atropine was found, and realizes it was administered to Quinn. To flush out the traitor, he orders a search of everyone's bags. Much to Qasim's (Alireza Bayram) surprise, Zaheer is killed when his bag has no atropine inside. Bibi later reveals to Qasim that he switched the bags to protect Qasim since he is family, but threatens Qasim's life if he is defiant again. Dar notifies the BND that Quinn had infiltrated a cell in Berlin led by a nephew of Abu Al-Qaduli. With this information, the BND determines Bibi's identity. By cross-referencing locations of Bibi's recent credit card purchases with buildings that feature the work of the artist, the BND is able to narrow its search to a handful of locations. When investigating one of the addresses, Carrie and Astrid find Quinn barely clinging to life, as well as the body of Zaheer. Quinn is taken to a hospital and placed in intensive care.  Production  The episode was directed by Dan Attias and co-written by executive producer Meredith Stiehm and Charlotte Stoudt.  Reception  = Reviews = The episode received a rating of 64% with an average score of 6.8 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating \\"'New Normal' takes an exciting new turn but at the expense of a long-gestating spy story set up by Homeland's previous episodes\\". Price Peterson of New York Magazine rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars while remarking on its effectiveness in connecting the season's plot lines and conveying the horror of the characters' circumstances. Scott Collura of IGN rated the episode 8.0 out of 10, saying that the key scenes involving Allison and Quinn were compelling, but also noting that it \\"felt a little desperate\\" in integrating Quinn with the other lead characters. Ethan Renner of The Baltimore Sun felt that the episode was \\"somewhat of a letdown\\", citing some \\"clunky plot devices\\" and one- dimensionality of the Jihadist group's characters. = Ratings = The original broadcast was watched by 1.74 million viewers, an increase in viewership from the previous week of 1.42 million viewers.

Intended as Nooten's debut solo album after a brief split from Clan of Xymox, the record turned into a collaboration with Brook after a suggestion from 4AD label founder and boss Ivo Watts- Russell. Though not a huge commercial success, Sleeps with the Fishes was described by AllMusic as \\"essential listening for fans of 4AD, ambient music, minimalism, experimental electronic music, and morose themes alike... an overlooked masterpiece.\\" Background According to Martin Aston's 2013 book Facing the Other Way: The Story of 4AD, the genesis of the album formed after Pieter Nooten left Clan of Xymox in 1987 (leader Ronny Moorings subsequently restored the band's name to simply 'Xymox').Aston, pg.256 \\"For me, Pieter was the heart of Xymox, and taking him out, they became much more like their influences. Pieter was more interested in classical music at that point,\\" said Ivo Watts-Russell. Nooten had told Watts-Russell that he had some \\"basic, but still intimate, melancholic material,\\" which the label boss had appreciated and responded with the offer of making a solo album. Watts-Russell chose London's Blackwing Studios as the recording location, but Nooten claims he \\"couldn't bring anything fresh to [the recordings]... we needed new blood.\\" Watts-Russell was a fan of the Editions EG Records label, and suggested Canadian ambient guitarist and producer Michael Brook, whose debut album Hybrid (featuring Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois) had caught the label boss's ear. \\"Michael's input was so large, it became a joint record... I was really enjoying Brian Eno and Michael's first album, so I loved releasing something in that vein, combined with Pieter's melodies,\\" said Watts-Russell.Aston, pgs.256 and 257 Nooten hailed Brook as \\"the ultimate producer - calm, thoughtful, highly skilled and, above all, a brilliant guitarist. We shared the same approach to the material: subtle, sensitive, thoughtful, intimate and intense.\\"Aston, pg.257 A number of tracks on Sleeps with the Fishes were re- recorded from previous Clan of Xymox contributions: \\"Equal Ways\\" from 1985's Clan of Xymox, and \\"After the Call\\" and \\"Theme I\\" (herein renamed \\"Clouds\\" and featuring vocals and lyrics) from 1986's Medusa. Sleeps with the Fishes was released as 4AD catalog number CAD 710 in October 1987 on vinyl LP and CD in the United Kingdom (a reissue of the CD briefly appeared in 1998, with revised tray and disc artwork and the \\"reissue catalog number\\" of GAD 710). The album features a roster of 4AD alum and session musicians, including violinist Gini Ball, vocalist Alison Limerick, and percussionists Peter Ulrich and John Fryer, all of whom had performed as part of the 4AD supergroup This Mortal Coil across three albums: 1984's It'll End in Tears, 1986's Filigree & Shadow, and 1991's Blood. Additionally, Nooten and vocalist Deirdre Rutkowski performed a version of \\"Several Times I\\" as part of This Mortal Coil on the collective's album Blood in 1991. The artwork for Sleeps with the Fishes was designed by Vaughan Oliver, with calligraphy by graphic designer Chris Bigg and photography by Diana Grandi and Sarah Tucker. Following the album's release, Nooten rejoined the rebranded Xymox, now signed to Wing/PolyGram Records, for their third and fourth albums, Twist of Shadows (1989) and Phoenix (1991), with the latter album featuring guitar from Brook on two tracks. Brook would continue producing and recording, including three further albums on 4AD: Cobalt Blue and Live at the Aquarium in 1992, and the motion picture soundtrack for the film Albino Alligator in 1997. Reception AllMusic's Tim DiGravina awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars, praising that, \\"It's hard to imagine this collaboration between [Nooten and Brook] working any better. Sleeps with the Fishes comprises 15 excellent, moody soundscapes, given depth by Nooten's subtle vocals and instrumentation that sounds piped in from some dreamy other world. Brook's guitar rings and chimes, sounding cleaner, and his guitar work is more precise than ever. Synthesizers creep in and around the vocals and guitar to stunning effect. The album seems to define the word 'mysterious.'\\" DiGravina concludes, \\"Sleeps with the Fishes could not be a more perfect dark ambient, experimental album. It's essential listening for fans of 4AD, ambient music, minimalism, experimental electronic music, and morose themes alike. This album is an overlooked masterpiece.\\" Jason Morehead of music blog Opus said of the album, \\"Sleeps with the Fishes is adept at taking what should be morose music and converts it into something resplendent. And it maintains that sad, beautiful sensation throughout its length. Not too many albums have such a perfectly-realized mood and atmosphere, one that draws you into its haunting world and stays with you long after the last song ends. But Sleeps with the Fishes is just such an album. And though some of its content delves into the goth and ambient genres, it easily avoids the former's self-indulgent melodramatics and the latter's vacuousness.\\" Sleeps with the Fishes also holds high rank with 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell, who said, \\"Among the forum world of 4AD followers, some people think it's 4AD's best record. I'd place it in the top ten. It's absolutely beautiful. So is the sleeve, with Chris Bigg's embossed calligraphy.\\" The album is also a favorite and inspiration to Warren Defever, whose art rock project His Name Is Alive would sign with 4AD in 1990. Defever singles out Sleeps with the Fishes and fellow 4AD releases Le Myst√®re des Voix Bulgares by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir and This Mortal Coil's cover of \\"Song to the Siren\\" as most influential, and told Martin Aston in Facing the Other Way: The Story of 4AD in 2013, \\"Twenty-five years later, they still seem just as important, inspirational, bewildering and mystifying.\\"Aston, pg.324 Track listing Credits =Musicians= *Pieter Nooten ‚Äì keyboards, vocals *Michael Brook ‚Äì infinite guitars, keyboards, buzz bass *Gini Ball ‚Äì violin *Tim Eaton ‚Äì oboe *John Fryer ‚Äì percussion on \\"Suddenly\\" *Alison Limerick ‚Äì vocals on \\"Equal Ways\\" *Audrey Riley ‚Äì cello *Rob Suters ‚Äì string arrangements, piano *Peter Ulrich ‚Äì percussion =Production= ;Recording personnel *Michael Brook ‚Äì producer, engineer *Nigel K.

The conference strengthened her belief in energy independence and she became a vocal advocate, traveling throughout the world speaking for responsible development of the industry. She was a member of the American Association of Petroleum Landmen and in 1978 received a Distinguished Service Award from them. She also spoke on behalf of Women in Energy and was honored by them with the 1980 Woman of Achievement in Energy award. Between 1978 and 1982 she received multiple awards from the Oklahoma Petroleum Council Speakers Bureau and in 1982, was one of the inaugural inductees into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame. Brooks continued lobbying on behalf of the oil and gas industry throughout the 1980s, urging industry officials to become politically involved, write their congress members and the president of the United States in protest of moratoriums on exploration. Brooks continued to be honored after retirement, with such honors as a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Energy Advocates in 2005, a A Salute to Oklahoma's Energy Past by Oklahoma's Energy Advocates in 2007 and inclusion in a book, Astronauts, Athlete & Ambassadors, Oklahoma Women from 1950 to 2007, published as part of Oklahoma's centennial.

The show covered the English Football League and its cup competitions; the EFL Cup and the EFL Trophy. It was replaced for the 2018‚Äì19 season by EFL on Quest. The show was sponsored by Sky Bet (also sponsors of the Football League), Ginsters and Evans Halshaw. Background Channel 5 regularly covered football from its launch in 1997, including the Scottish League Cup, Serie A, the UEFA Europa League and international football, but Football on 5 had been off air for three years after losing the rights to the Europa League. In May 2015 Channel 5 won the rights to broadcast highlights for the Football League and the Football League Cup from the 2015‚Äì16 in a three-year deal. The contract succeeded the BBC's six-year coverage of the league with The Football League Show and gave Channel 5 their first foray into English domestic league football. The highlights show was agreed to be broadcast at 9 pm, around an hour and a half before the typical Match of the Day slot; previously the BBC had shown The Football League Show after Match of the Day. Format Initially, the show was named Football League Tonight and its format was similar to its BBC predecessor, The Football League Show. During the 2015‚Äì16 season, the format changed and the programme was split into two 30-minute segments; the first part called The Championship, which shows highlights of the games from its namesake division, and Goal Rush, which only covers the key incidents from Leagues One and Two. League Cup highlights were originally shown under the name Capital One Cup Tonight, taking the name of the title sponsor of the competition. For 2016‚Äì17, the programme followed suit of its Championship counterpart, becoming Football on 5: The EFL Cup. Presenters and pundits For the 2015‚Äì16 season, George Riley and Kelly Cates from BBC Radio 5 Live were chosen to be the presenters of the show. Cates had also worked on football coverage for ITV Sport, ESPN and Talksport, whilst Riley has worked for BBC TV and radio on coverage of rugby league, football, darts and snooker. Both hosted coverage of the Football League, with Cates presenting League Cup highlights alone. A number of commentators are used for the programme, the main one being Paul Walker, who produces commentary for the Pitch International World Feed, who also worked for the BBC on The Football League Show. Other commentators include Paul Farrar, Dan O'Hagan, Martin Fisher and John Roder. Channel 5 also use Sky Sports commentators for their match highlight coverage such as Bill Leslie and Daniel Mann. Match reporters include Dave Beckett, Sue Thearle, Adam Lockwood, Tom Skippings and Matt Williams. The show has a mixture of former players and managers as pundits; Adam Virgo is the most frequent pundit having appeared on both Cup and League highlights shows. Other pundits that have worked on the show are Michael Gray, Mark Bright, Gus Poyet, Alex McLeish, Jamie Cureton, Clinton Morrison and Karl Robinson. For the 2016‚Äì17 EFL season, George Riley will host for the second season running, this season alongside Lynsey Hipgrave from BBC Radio 5 Live's Danny Baker Show and BT Sport, as the presenters of the new look show, which returns with the name Football on 5 (The Championship or Goal Rush, depending upon which portion of the show it is). Paul Walker will return to commentary duties of the featured Saturday match not broadcast by Sky Sports. Bill Leslie, Daniel Mann and Gary Weaver will also return as commentators (from the Sky Sports live matches broadcast). On 22 July 2017, it was reported that break clauses had been activated in Riley and Hipgrave's contracts and they would be replaced by Colin Murray for the 2017‚Äì18 season.

Rayi Ratna Ministries) was a prolific writer, theologian and comparative religion scholar who once served as the principal of the Gurukul Lutheran Theological College, Chennai, affiliated to the nation's firstUNESCO Structures of University Education in India, 1952 university, the Senate of Serampore College (University). Some of the writings of Sundara Rao are kept in digitized versions at the National Library of India and the Indian Institute of Science. In a recent 2014 study by Katherine C. Zubko of the University of North Carolina at Asheville, Zubko highlights that Sundara Rao's assumption of Bhakti was a more inward expression for concern for others cutting across religious boundaries.Katherine C. Zubko, Dancing Bodies of Devotion: Fluid Gestures in Bharata Natyam, Lexington Books, Plymouth, 2014, p.86. In fact, Sundara Rao's treatise, Bhakti Theology in the Telugu Hymnal had struck new ground in finding out the origins of Bhakti element in Christian Hymns in Telugu. The Missiologist, Roger E. Hedlund asserted that along with the Bible, the Christian Hymnal in Telugu also formed the main bulwark of Christian spiritual life for the Telugu folk and of equal use to both the non-literates and the literates as well.Roger E. Hedlund, Quest for Identity: India's Churches of Indigenous origin: The \\"Little\\" Tradition in Indian Christianity, New Delhi, 2000, p.261. In such a setting of the importance of the Telugu Hymnal, Sundara Rao's study reiteratedJames Elisha Taneti, History of the Telugu Christians: A Bibliography, Scarecrow/ATLA, Toronto, 2011, p.11. the fact that Bhakti had been a binding factor for the early Christians in the Telugu-speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. While this has been so, new studies in 2014 by Harvard-Scholars, Ch. Vasantha Rao and John B. Carman indicate that the element of Bhakti had not done much inroads into the otherwise rural India which in their study wholly depended on folk element.John B. Carman, Chilkuri Vasantha Rao, Christians in South Indian Villages 1959-2009, Decline and Revival in Telangana, Eerdmans Publishing, Cambridge, 2014, pp.68-71. Studies Sundara Rao had his ministerial formation at the Lutheran Theological College, Rajahmundry, affiliated to the nation's first University, the Senate of Serampore College (University), under the Principalship of G. Devasahayam. He graduated in the year 1960Jubilee year reports - Report of the President of the Senate for the year 1960, Serampore College, 1961, p.11 and was awarded a L. Th. degree by then Registrar of the University, Chetti Devasahayam, CBCNC. Sundara Rao later upgraded his academics by pursuing a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Sundara Rao was awarded a degree by the University, again during the Registrarship of Chetti Devasahayam. For language studies, Sundara Rao enrolled for a graduate and postgraduate programme in Telugu at the Andhra University and the Venkateshwara University which awarded him with a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts respectively. Sundara Rao also researched from 1976 to 1980 at the University of Wisconsin, MadisonThe Galveston Daily, News from Galveston, Texas, 12 January 1980, page 9. submitting a dissertation in 1981 entitled The bhakti element in ƒÄndhra Kraistava Kƒ´rtanalu : an intensive study of the phenomenon of bhakti, a Sanskrit word for devotion, as presented in the Telugu Christian HymnalR. R. Sundara Rao, The Bhakti element in ƒÄndhra Kraistava Kƒ´rtanalu : an intensive study of the phenomenon of bhakti, a Sanskrit word for devotion, as presented in the Telugu Christian Hymnal, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 1981. Ecclesiastical career Sundara Rao was a Pastor of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church Society and ministered in congregations until his appointment as Lecturer in 1973 at the Andhra Christian Theological College, Hyderabad where he taught in an ecumenical setting with other Protestant congregations. In fact, the Lutheran Theological College, Rajahmundry in which Sundara Rao had his ministerial formation amalgamated itself in 1964 into Andhra Christian Theological College, a special purpose entity which comprised four existing Seminaries, * the Andhra Union Theological College, Dornakal comprising the Anglicans and the Methodists, * the Baptist Theological Seminary, Kakinada comprising the Baptists (Canadian), and * the Lutheran Theological College, Rajahmundry comprising the Lutherans (American and German), * the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary, Ramayapatnam comprising the Baptists (American). Sundara Rao taught in the special purpose entity from 1973 through 1988 when the College was led by three Church Societies, namely the Church of South India, the Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars and the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches led by Victor Premasagar, K. David, and S. Joseph respectively. From 1988 onwards, Sundara Rao accepted a teaching assignment at the Gurukul Lutheran Theological College, Chennai and taught Religions. On 1 April 1992, Sundara Rao was made Principal of the College, a role which brought greater responsibilities on him. On 9 November 1992, he breathed his last in Chennai.

As a three-year-old she won the Prix Vanteaux and finished second in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches but then missed the second half of the season. At four she won the Dahlia Stakes in England and the Group One Prix Rothschild in France and in 2015 she added further Group One victories in the Prix Jacques Le Marois and the Sun Chariot Stakes. Background Esoterique is a bay mare with a small white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by her owner √âdouard de Rothschild's Ecurie de Meautry. √âdouard de Rothschild sent the filly into training with Andr√© Fabre at Chantilly. She was sired by Danehill Dancer, who won the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes and Greenham Stakes before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Choisir, Mastercraftsman and Dancing Rain. Esoterique's dam, Dievotchka, was an unraced daughter of Dancing Brave and a descendant of the influential broodmare Queen of Light. Dievotchka had produced several other winners including the Group Two winners Russian Hope (Grand Prix de Deauville), Russian Cross (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano), and Archange d'Or (Prix Eug√®ne Adam). Racing career =2013: three-year-old season= Esoterique was unraced as a juvenile and began her racing career with a win in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 9 April. Less than three weeks later at Longchamp Racecourse she was stepped up in class and started 13/8 favourite for the Group Three Prix Vanteaux over 1850 metres. Ridden as in all of her early races by Maxime Guyon, she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from Silasol. The runner-up had won the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac on her previous start. On 8 May at the same course Esoterique was made 2/1 favourite in a twenty-runner field for the Group One Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. She took the lead in the last 200 metres but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf winner Flotilla. She was then stepped up in distance for the Prix de Diane at Chantilly in June but failed to show her best form, finishing seventh behind Treve. =2014: four- year-old season= Esoterique was the beaten favourite in her first two races of 2014. She finished fourth in the Listed Prix Altipan at Saint-Cloud in March and fourth again in the Prix Edmond Blanc at the same course in April. She was then sent to England for the Dahlia Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 4 May. She was made the 9/4 second favourite behind Integral, a British filly who had won the Atalanta Stakes and finished second in the Sun Chariot Stakes in 2013. Esoterique tracked the leaders before accelerating into the lead a furlong out and got the better of a sustained \\"duel\\" with Integral to win by a head, with the pair finishing more than three lengths clear of the other five runners. She returned to England in June for the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot, but tired badly in the closing stages and finished unplaced behind Integral. On her return to France, Esoterique started the 12/1 outsider in a four-runner field in the Group One Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 3 August. The race is named after Edouard de Rothschild's father Guy de Rothschild. With Guyon taking the mount on the Fabre stable's more fancied runner Miss France, the ride on Esoterique was taken by Pierre-Charles Boudot. The other two runners were Integral, who was made the odds-on favourite, and L'Amour de Ma Vie the winner of the Group Two Balanchine in Dubai. Esoterique raced down the centre of the course before tracking across to the far side before half way. She was still last of the four runners 200 metres from the finish but finished strongly, took the lead in closing stages and won by three quarters of a length from Miss France, with Integral in third. In September she was matched against colts in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp and finished fourth behind Charm Spirit, Toronado and Night of Thunder, beaten less than one and a half lengths by the winner. On her final appearance of the season met Integral again when the pair started co-favourites alongside Miss France and the Prix de Sandringham winner Fintry in the Sun Chariot Stkes at Newmarket on 4 October. She reached fourth place a furlong out but could make no further progress and finished in the same position, two and three quarter lengths behind Integral. =2015: five-year-old season= Boudot took over from Guyon as Esoterique's regular jockey in 2015. The mare began her season in the Prix du Muguet at Saint-Cloud on 1 May and finished third of the eight runners behind Bawina. In June she was sent for the second time to Royal Ascot and started a 16/1 outsider in a much-anticipated race for the Queen Anne Stakes which attracted eight runners including Solow, Able Friend, Night of Thunder and Toormore. She was not among the early leaders but made steady progress in the last quarter mile to finish second, a length behind Solow. At Deauville in August, the mare was dropped back in distance to take on specialist sprinters in the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres. She was restrained by Boudot in the early stages before finishing strongly to take second place, beaten half a length by the three-year-old colt Muhaarar. A week after her defeat in the Prix Maurice de Gheest, Esoterique ran for the second time in the Prix Jacques Le Marois and started the 5.5/1 third favourite behind Territories (Prix Jean Prat) and Toormore. The other seven runners, in a race run on very soft ground included the Breeders' Cup Mile winner Karakontie and Belardo, the top-rated European two-year-old of 2014. After racing towards the rear of the field she began to make progress 400 metres from the finish. She took the lead 200 metres out, broke clear of her rivals and won by one and a half lengths from Territories, with the German-trained Wild Chief taking third. After the race Rothschild said \\"The plan was to treat last week like exercise and she never showed any signs of having a race afterwards. Andr√© Fabre had her in super shape but we were very worried about the ground. In the end her quality spoke and she won well. She is an extremely consistent filly... She has an immense turn of foot and she has is really showing her quality now.\\" On 4 October Esoterique returned to England and faced her old rival Integral in the Sun Chariot Stakes. The other runners were Bawina, Fadhayyil (City of York Stakes), Maimara (Prix de Lieurey), Realtra (Sceptre Stakes), Mlabar (Thoroughbred Stakes), Raydara (Debutante Stakes) and Irish Rookie (runner-up in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches). After tracking the leaders Esoterique moved up to challenge Integral inside the final furlong. Despite Boudot dropping his whip in the closing stages, Esoterique prevailed to win by half a length with Irish Rookie taking third ahead of Fadhayyil. Fabre commented \\"She has had a remarkable season and it was a very solid performance. She looked a bit workmanlike but she did it very easily at the end and Integral is a very good mare.\\" On her final start of the season, Esoterique was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Keeneland on 31 October. She was restrained in the early stages in a slowly-run race and although she made some late progress she never looked likely to win and finished seventh of the twelve runners behind Tepin. =2016: six-year-old season= Esoterique began hew 2016 in the Pris du Palais Royal at Deauville on 4 June: she started odds-on favourite but was beaten two lengths into second place by the three- year-old colt Attendu. In June she made her second bid for the Queen Anne Stakes but was never in contention and finished unplaced behind Tepin.

It was the home ground of Royal Albert. History Royal Albert played at Raploch Park from their foundation in 1878. The ground was on the north-western side of Raploch Street, opposite Gasworks Park, the home ground of Larkhall Thistle. The ground had a running track around the outside of the pitch, and a pavilion and covered stand were erected on the north-western side of the pitch. The track was later elongated to allow greyhound racing, with kennels built in the northern corner of the site.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p210 The ground's probable record attendance of 5,000 was set on 6 December 1890 for a Scottish Cup fifth round replay match against Celtic, with the visitors winning 4‚Äì0. This was equalled for a Scottish Cup second round match against Dundee on 11 February 1922, which Royal Albert lost 1‚Äì0, and again for a Scottish Cup first round replay against Clydebank on 17 January 1923, which ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw. Royal Albert were elected into the new Third Division of the Scottish Football League in the same year, and the first SFL match at Raploch Park was played on 18 August 1923, a 3‚Äì0 win over Dumbarton Harp. However, the Third Division was disbanded at the end of the 1925‚Äì26 season, with the final SFL match played at the ground on 16 April 1926, a 3‚Äì0 win over Montrose. Although Royal Albert folded, they were reformed as a Junior club, which continued to use the ground until the 1960s, when it was demolished and the site used for housing. The club moved to Robert Smillie Memorial Park. Greyhound racing Sam Park and George Reid introduced greyhound racing to the sports stadium in 1938. The venue would be known as the Larkhall Greyhound Stadium from 1938 and the first meeting took place on 21 December 1938. The racing was independent (unlicensed) for 26 years until the track closed in 1964. Robert Hamilton remained as the Racing Manager throughout the entire 26 years.

PU2RC uses both transmission pre-coding and multi- user scheduling. By doing that, the network capacity is further enhanced than the capacity of the single-user MIMO scheme. * Background technologies: A single-user MIMO was initially developed to improve the spectral efficiency of point-to-point wireless transmission link. A multi-user MIMO was developed for cellular systems where the base station simultaneously communicates with multiple users. * Principle: The concept of Per-User Unitary Rate Control (PU2RC) was proposed in US Patent No. 7,324,480, Mobile communication apparatus and method including base station and mobile station having multi- antenna by James S. Kim, Kwang Bok Lee, Kiho Kim and Changsoon Park. Recently, PU2RC has been adopted in the IEEE 802.16m system description documentation (SDD) and the concept of this scheme was included in 3GPP LTE standard. Technology Per-user unitary rate control (PU2RC) is a practical multi-user MIMO solution. PU2RC allows a base station to transmit different data streams to multiple users simultaneously. The base station selects target users from candidate users based on the information fed by users. Transmission data are multiplied by a pre-coding matrix selected from the set of predefined matrices before transmission. The selection of a pre-coding matrix is determined based on the information provided by users. The selection of both target users and a pre-coding matrix according to the information provided by mobiles enables the utilization of multi-user diversity and data multiplexing at the same time. Moreover. Using predefined precoding matrices reduces feedback overhead from users to the base station. Pre-coding matrices used in this scheme is unitary. The use of unitary pre-coding matrices facilitates the estimation of interference from other users' data to the unintended user. Mathematical description The operation of PU2RC is mathematically described for the transmitter and receiver sides, respectively. =Base station= It is assumed that the base station employs N_t transmission antennas. The N_t \\\\times 1 transmission signal vector is given by :\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\mathbf{w}_i P_i s_i where \\\\mathbf{w}_i is the N_t \\\\times 1 linear precoding vector. PU2RC generates \\\\mathbf{w}_i based on the received finite channel status information, which is delivered to the base station from the user equipment (UE) through uplink feedback signaling. The feedback signal consists of index in a look-up table of a precoding codebook. =Receiver side= Every receiver has a receive antenna array with N_r elements. The receive signal vector at user k (=1,2,\\\\ldots,K) is modeled as follows: :\\\\mathbf{y}_k = \\\\mathbf{H}_k\\\\mathbf{x}+\\\\mathbf{n}_k where \\\\mathbf{y}_k and \\\\mathbf{n}_k are the N_r \\\\times 1 received symbol and noise, respectively, and \\\\mathbf{H}_k is the N_r \\\\times N_t matrix with the channel coefficients. =Throughput performance= The figure illustrates the throughput advantage of PU2RC over the conventional single-user and no scheduling scheme, assuming that the codebook size is one, i.e., (G=1). For larger codebook sizes the performance can be better than the performance of the unit-size codebook. Because of codebook-based multi-user scheduling, PU2RC outperforms the conventional single-user and no scheduling scheme when the number of users is larger than one. Note that the performance plotted in the figure for the two systems were obtained assuming linear receiver. Source and background materials = Source materials = * James S. Kim, K. B.

He held again the post during the regency of Zoe Karbonopsina in 913‚Äì919, where he played an important role in the governance of the state. He lost his post after he supported his relative Leo Phokas the Elder in his unsuccessful rivalry with Romanos I Lekapenos over control of the throne, but he was later appointed to the post of primikerios by Lekapenos. Biography Constantine was the son of a peasant or landholder named Metrios, and hailed from Paphlagonia. He was surnamed \\"Barbaros\\", \\"the barbarian\\", but it is not clear why. The Life of Basil the Younger reports that it reflected his foreign origin, but his family seems to have been native Byzantine; it is possible that the Lifes account is a later attempt to explain his surname. Alternatively it could be a derogatory reference to his rustic roots from Paphlagonia. He had been castrated by his father at a young age precisely to open up the possibility of a career at court. Constantine had at least one sister, who was married to the general Leo Phokas the Elder, and was a relative of the eunuch officials Constantine Gongyles and Anastasios Gongyles. Constantine is first mentioned in the sources as a servant or follower‚Äîsome modern researchers have called him a slave, but this is unlikely‚Äîof the magistros and kanikleios Basil, of whom nothing is known. He then entered the service of the powerful imperial chamberlain, Samonas. The latter was a eunuch Arab prisoner of war who became a favourite of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912), rising to the rank of patrikios, the highest court rank open to a eunuch, and the positions of protovestiarios. By 907 he had been awarded the supreme court post of parakoimomenos. Constantine is tonsured at the Monastery of St. Tarasios at Samonas' orders. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes In the same year, in a bid to ingratiate himself with Leo's fourth wife, Zoe Karbonopsina, he presented her with Constantine as a gift. The imperial couple took an immediate liking to Constantine, so much that Samonas began to fear for his own influence and position. As a result, he tried to slander Constantine, claiming that he was having an affair with the empress. Leo initially believed the accusations, and had Constantine banished to the Monastery of St. Tarasios. Samonas himself performed Constantine's tonsure. Soon, however, Leo began to miss his new favourite. He had him moved to Samonas' own Speira Monastery, and during an \\"accidental\\" visit there, pardoned Constantine and took him with him back to the palace. Samonas then resorted to another scheme: with his secretary Constantine the Rhodian he produced a pamphlet, supposedly written by Constantine, which insulted the emperor, and arranged for Leo to read it. His machinations, however, were betrayed by one of his fellow conspirators, and Samonas was dismissed, tonsured, and banished to the monastery of Martinakios in summer of 908. Constantine succeeded him as imperial parakoimomenos. Leo gifted him with a monastery at Nosiai, which was inaugurated by the emperor and patriarch Euthymius in person. Constantine remained the parakoimomenos until the Leo's death, but was apparently dismissed by Leo's brother and successor Alexander (r. 912‚Äì913), because the sources report that Empress Zoe recalled him to the position of parakoimomenos when she assumed the regency over her underage son Constantine VII (r. 913‚Äì959) in autumn 913. Constantine shortly after accused Theophylact, the newly appointed commander of the imperial bodyguard, the Hetaireia, of plotting to have his brother made emperor. Empress Zoe accordingly dismissed Theophylact. During the remainder of the regency of Zoe, Constantine played apparently a major role in the governance of the state. Two letters by Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos to Constantine (or a subordinate) show his involvement in the financial administration‚Äîspecifically the exploitation of church property to the benefit of the state treasury‚Äîas well as the organization of games with animal fights to celebrate an alliance with the Pechenegs, an event which the Patriarch condemned as un-Christian, and for which he ordered Constantine and other leading officials to conduct a penance. At some point during this period (914‚Äì918), his sister died, and Nicholas Mystikos wrote him a letter of condolences. In the De Administrando Imperio, composed by Constantine VII in his later reign, Constantine Barbaros is dismissed as incompetent, and criticized for some of his decisions regarding promotions and appointments. Following the series of military disasters in the ongoing war against Bulgaria, Zoe's regime was shaken, and the path to the throne was opened to ambitious military leaders: Constantine's brother-in-law Leo Phokas, and the commander of the Imperial Fleet, Romanos Lekapenos (eventually emperor in 920‚Äì944). Although both bore heavy responsibility for the defeats against Bulgaria, they controlled the only readily available military forces near Constantinople. According to the Byzantine chroniclers, in winter 918/919 (or winter 919/920, the date is disputed among scholars), Constantine engaged in machinations to secure the rise of Phokas to the throne. Urged by his tutor Theodore, the young Constantine VII then turned to Lekapenos for support. The latter initially hesitated, but eventually agreed. It is however possible that the story of Constantine's plotting was a later invention by the supporters of Lekapenos, to justify his actions leading to his eventual usurpation of the throne. Although the alliance between Lekapenos and the young emperor became known in the capital, Constantine disregarded it, so that when he ordered the fleet paid up and discharged, he was unconcerned enough to visit the ships in person, whereupon he was duly taken prisoner by Lekapenos' men. When the empress went to the harbour to enquire as to the reasons of her favourite's arrest, Theodore replied that Leo Phokas had ruined the state (through his failed leadership against the Bulgarians) and Constantine was ruining the palace. The bloodless coup was a success: Nicholas Mystikos was re-appointed as regent in place of Zoe, and his first step was to dismiss Leo Phokas from his post as Domestic of the Schools. As the Patriarch tried to curb the power of Lekapenos, however, on 25 March the admiral seized the Boukoleon harbour and forcibly removed the Patriarch from the palace. Constantine VII was ostensibly installed as sole ruler, but the power now lay with Lekapenos and his followers. Constantine Barbaros himself was allowed to keep his position for a while, but only after swearing fealty and writing letters to his brother-in-law urging him not to rebel against the emperor. This was in vain, as in October 920 Phokas rose in revolt. The sources report that the parakoimomenos supported his bid for the throne, but this seems unlikely, as he was not punished after the failure of Phokas' uprising. According to the Life of Basil the Younger, Constantine retained the rank of primikerios during the later half of the reign of Romanos Lekapenos (i.e. between 931 and 944), and was allowed to keep his palace near Arcadianae, built for him at imperial expense during his tenure as parakoimomenos. The hagiography reports that Constantine hosted Basil in the palace for several years until his death, giving him use of a portion of it as his residence, which he used to receive visits and perform healing miracles; and that there Basil became acquainted with several senior members of the court, including Emperor Romanos Lekapenos and Empress Helena Lekapene. Constantine was still alive when Basil died in 944 (or 952).

Aedes africanus is mainly found in tropical forests not near wetlands.  Identification  This mosquito has distinct white and black stripes along its body which help differentiate the genus from others in this family. Females of this species are ectoparasites and can most often be found on mammals living in the tropical forests of Africa. The africanus species can be distinguished from other mosquitoes in the genus Aedes by having white scales on the maxillary palpi, scutum with a patch of large white scales, and 3 large white patches on the mid-femur.  Life cycle  The lifecycle of mosquitoes in the Aedes genus. This species lays its eggs in holes in trees, cut bamboo, bamboo stumps, and tree forks. In laboratory settings, it was observed that the larvae hatch best at 27 ¬∞C and the quantity of water was not a factor in embryonic development but we most often laid within 2 cm of the water surface. Aedes africanus adults are crepuscular feeders, meaning they feed from dusk to dawn. Although this species is a vector for many diseases, because it is mainly found in forests, primates are its main source of blood meals. Early studies of its populations suggest that when sampled in forested areas, it made up 95% of the caught species and only 50% in surrounding villages. When populations are high enough, Toxorhynchites mosquitoes can be brought in as a biological control as they parasitize africanus larvae in the shared breeding habitat.  Medical importance  Very closely related to Aedes africanus, this Aedes aegypti mosquito is also a very important vector of the yellow fever virus. This species of mosquito is an essential yellow fever vector in wooded habitats. In addition to being a major vector of yellow fever, Aedes africanus also vectors pathogens such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Rift Valley fever virus.http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/projects/uganda5.html It is also a vector of Zika virus, the causal agent of Zika fever.

She is best known for her drama What Every Girl Should Know and her debut novel The Girl in the Road, which won the 2015 James Tiptree, Jr. Award and was nominated for the Locus and Kitschies awards.  Life and career  Monica Byrne was born on July 13, 1981 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The youngest of five children, she grew up in the college town of Annville, where her father was a lecturer at Lebanon Valley College. Her mother was diagnosed with brain cancer when Monica was seven, and died when Monica was 20. She attended the Our Lady of the Valley Catholic School for girls in neighboring Lebanon. She earned a B.A. in biochemistry and religion at Wellesley College and an M.S. in geochemistry at MIT. Wanting to become an astronaut and go to Mars, she became an intern at NASA. However, instead of pursuing a scientific career, she decided to become a writer. In 2008, she attended the Clarion Workshop with Neil Gaiman. She began writing fiction and plays. In 2011, she was artist-in-residence at Vermont Studio Center and Elsewhere Collective. From 2012 to 2017, she was the playwright-in-residence at Little Green Pig Theatrical Concern, in Durham, North Carolina. Her plays have been performed in other theaters as well. Her drama What Every Girl Should Know, about girls at a Catholic girls school around 1914 who worship birth control and woman's rights activist Margaret Sanger, was performed in Durham, Berkeley, and New York. The title of the play is drawn from the name of Sanger's sex education column in the New York Call, published in 1912 and 1913. Robert Hurwitt of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that \\"Byrne's often clever, provocative script isn't fully fleshed out\\" and \\"the swift pacing doesn't make up for how thinly Byrne has developed her story or characters\\". Pat Craig of the San Jose Mercury News praised the \\"often lighthearted banter and genuine humor that makes the piece float and deliver some powerful messages without sounding the least like proselytizing\\". Her first novel, The Girl in the Road (2014), is set in a future where India and Africa have become economic superpowers. It interleaves the stories of Meena, a young woman crossing the Arabian Sea westward from Mumbai to Djibouti on a floating power-generating bridge, and Mariama, a little girl riding a truck eastward across the African continent from Mauritania to Djibouti. The Wall Street Journal praised it as \\"a new sensation, a real achievement\\", whereas Jason Heller of NPR called it a \\"frustrating patchwork,\\" albeit concluding \\"...it doesn't make The Girl in the Road's dizzying journey less than worthwhile.\\" Byrne considers Norman Rush, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Ursula K.

Despite not having a unified section of seats, the Crimson Guard is one of the largest student sections in the nation. History Until Tom Crean became the head coach of Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball, the Indiana University did not have an official student section. Despite IU's storied basketball program and its established tradition, IU was one of the last schools in the Big Ten to have an official student section. In 2007, during two home games against Purdue and Iowa, tension rose between the current students and alumni when the \\"cross-armed\\" alumni remained seated during the games. Beau Dunffee, an IU student at the time, began a \\"Stand up old people\\" cheer, which eventually led to the revolt to get an official student section at Assembly Hall. Kelvin Sampson, the then-head coach, also expressed his wishes for a student section, claiming that a unified student section seated near the court would provide a greater advantage for the team. Dunfee argued that when it comes to student seating, it's quality over quantity. Even though there were 8,000 [scattered] seats reserved for students, not all of them were looked upon favorably. A 2007 ESPN poll said IU's students' spirit was 4th among all universities, which made the push for a student section all the more reasonable. Gaining attraction and having the platform to do it, D.J. White made one request during his speech on senior night. He asked that IU have a \\"real\\" student section, such as Michigan State's Izzone or University of Illinois' Orange Krush. He stated, \\"I want to give a special shout out to our sixth man, the student section. When I come back to visit, when I come back to watch a game, I actually hope we have a real student section, which we really deserve.\\" Sara Amato, from the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), wrote in June 2008 that the Indiana University Student Association (IUSA) was focusing their efforts on creating an official student section. Luke Fields, the IUSA president, said, \\"We can do our part. We‚Äôve got to get them to do theirs.\\" Noting the degree of difficulty, he named Tom Crean as an important figure in the creation of a student section. Despite the cries from the students, some people from the athletic department voiced their concerns. It is well known that basketball is the money-maker at IU; much of the campus' revenue comes from basketball ticket sales. It was claimed that if IU took away prime seating from alumni and gave it to the students, the result would be a loss in revenue. Other, similar concerns about the cost were also voiced. In the fall of 2008, during an enthusiastic lecture, Tom Crean was asked about an official student section during the Q&A; session. While he indirectly addressed the issue, he ultimately had no answers for the students. When he asked if a student section was something they would be interested in, the crowd erupted with cheers and applause. Crean asked that the students to be patient and give him some time, as this is something he would like as well. Having sold 9,100 tickets to students during the 2007-08 season but dissapoined that students had been showing up after tip-off, Crean said that if a student section was something that the students wanted, then it's something that should be considered. Still without a student section, IDS writer, Jeremy Rosenthal proposed creating a student section at the women's basketball games. The tickets to these games are free, so the university wouldn't have to be worried about losing money. Rosenthal argued that if the student section was considered successful, then perhaps that would be enough evidence to support having an official student section at the men's games. Finally, in 2009, the name \\"Crimson Guard\\" was selected by the students as the name of the new, official student section. Senior Assistant Athletic Director for Marketing, Pat Kraft, stated \\"The students are what makes Assembly Hall such a special place, and after tallying thousands of votes, they have decided their own name for the best student section in the country. We are extremely pleased at the turnout and look forward to continued support and excitement from the Crimson Guard.\\" Even though tickets and seating haven't changed, the Crimson Guard has started to form itself. Since becoming the official student section, the Crimson Guard has created their own website and Twitter account. In a recent 2010 effort, IU had their first \\"first-come, first-served\\" student section game. Students who held tickets for certain rows in certain sections during the 2010-11 season were able to sit wherever they wanted. Fred Glass, IU's athletic director, claimed that he was open to expanding this type of student section if it was popular; however, an entire, full-fledged \\"first-come, first-served\\" student section was unlikely due to a feared drop in overall ticket sales that might be caused if students started to cherry-pick games to attend.

Distribution The sole known Parvoblongoolithus jinguoensis specimen was found in the Upper Cretaceous Chichengshan Formation in Tiantai County, Zhejiang. Description Parvoblongoolithus known from only a single specimen. It is relatively small (measuring long by wide) with an asymmetrical shape, similar to modern bird eggs. The eggshell is 1.12 mm thick, with the barrel-shaped cones of the mammillary layer making up one-fifth of the total eggshell thickness. The pore system is prolatocanaliculate, meaning the pores vary in width along their length. The pore canals are thick and irregularly shaped. The outer surface of the eggshell is smooth. Despite having a bird-like shape and size, the P. jinguoensis has a very different microstructure, which bears a closer resemblance to non-avian dinosaur eggs than bird eggs. Most significantly, all known Cretaceous bird eggs have a three-layered eggshell, whereas the eggshell of Parvoblongoolithus is two-layered. Additionally, its pore system is prolatocanaliculate, unlike the angusticanaliculate pores of bird eggs (such as Laevisoolithidae or Gobioolithidae) and its microstructures are much more similar to those of stalicoolithids, Mosaicoolithus, and Paraspheroolithus. Palaeobiology Since no skeletal remains were associated with its remains, the parentage of Parvoblongoolithus is unknown. However, its microstructure suggests it was laid by some kind of non-avian dinosaur, related to the parents of Stalicoolithidae, Paraspheroolithus, or Mosaicoolithus. Parvoblongoolithus is remarkable for having an extremely thick shell (as thick as the shell of titanosaur eggs) despite being significantly smaller than its close relatives. This would have made it much more difficult for a baby dinosaur to break out of the egg without parental assistance. It is possible that Parvoblongoolithus actually represents a fossil dwarf egg, a type of deformity occasionally observed in modern birds when a disturbance of the oviducts causes them to form a small, deformed egg. This would explain both the thick eggshell and unique shape of P. jinguoensis. Parataxonomy Parvoblongoolithus has not been classified into any oofamily. The eggshell resembles the spherulitic type, but it lacks the radial-tabular ultrastructure. It is closely related to Paraspheroolithus, Mosaicoolithus, and stalicoolithids.

Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik (Detroid: MacMillan Reference USA, 2007), 124. As a Gallic prelate, Amulo is best known for his letters concerning two major themes: Christian‚ÄìJewish relations in the Frankish kingdom and the Carolingian controversy over predestination. He was ordained as archbishop in January 841.West, C. M. A. \\"Unauthorised Miracles in the Mid-ninth-century Dijon and the Carolingian Church Reforms.\\" Journal of Medieval History 36, no. 4 (2010): 297. Taylor & Francis Online. Amulo was a disciple of his predecessor Agobard and inherited many of his ideas.West, \\"Unauthorised Miracles\\", 297. Amulo collaborated closely with both Remigius of Lyon, who later succeeded him, and Florus of Lyon who served as scribe for Amulo;Victor Genke and Gumerlock, Francis X., eds. Gottschalk and a Medieval Predestination Controversy: Texts Translated from the Latin (Milwaukee, WI USA: Marquette University Press, 2010), 200. hence it is not always clear which of Amulo's letters were actually penned by him.\\"Amulo Lugdunesis,\\" In Clavis des auteurs latins du Moyen √Çge, territoire francais. 735‚Äì987, vol. 1, ed. M. H. Jullien and F. Perelman (Tournout: Brepols, 1994), 144. He also worked with Hincmar Archbishop of Reims regarding anti-Jewish policies and the debate with Gottschalk of Orbais over predestination. Like his predecessor, Amulo was unable to bring about anti-Jewish policies into the Carolingian Empire. However, he actively pursued \\"a policy of coercion against pro-Jewish Christians,\\" within his diocese, and his sermons were imbued with anti-Jewish teachings.Bernard S. Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy under Louis the Pious,\\" In Early Medieval Jewish Policy in Western Europe (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977), 120. His work was influential during the mid-ninth century ‚Äì most notably his Contra Judaeos and his involvement in the Council of Paris- Meaux in 845.Bat-Sheva Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos in the Carolingian Empire,\\" In Contra Iudaeos: Ancient and Medieval Polemics Between Christians and Jews, ed. Ora Limor and Guy Stroumsa (T√ºbingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1996), 121. These decrees were not ratified by Charles the Bald, since his magnates saw them as interfering with the traditional Carolingian policies regarding Jews; the Canons proposed at Paris-Meaux sought to revive earlier Visigothic laws, including Canon LXXIIII which prohibited Christians from \\"showing favour to Jews.\\" Nevertheless, both Amulo and his predecessor were instrumental in spreading anti-Jewish attitudes in the Carolingean court, which eventually sparked changes in \\"both exegesis and canon law.\\" Influences Carolingian theologians and scholars were widely influenced by Jewish texts during the ninth century.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 142. Figures such as Rabanus Maurus, Angelomus of Luxeuil, Claudius of Turin and Theodulf of Orl√©ans demonstrate a thorough knowledge of Jewish teachings, but this generated an anti-Jewish reaction.Richard Pollard, \\"The De Exidio of 'Hegesippus' and the Reaction of Josephus in the Early Middle Ages,\\" In VIATOR Medieval and Renaissance Studies, vol. 46 no.2 (Los Angeles: University of California, 2015), 121. Several contemporaries of Amulo ‚Äì including Rabanus and Angelomus ‚Äì held the traditional view of Jews as a people who refused to accept Christ due to their blindness.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 131. Knowledge of Hebrew and Greek was uncommon; it is likely that Jewish texts were merely cited to affirm the orthodoxy of the Church, and did not rely on accuracy. Amulo was an exception to this rule: he had at least a working knowledge of Hebrew, and his complex theological arguments affirm his knowledge of Hebrew scripture and Jewish scholarship.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 130.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 120. Most of Amulo's works also directly refer to the Church Fathers, including Saint Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory the Great. He mostly wrote on issues concerning Jewish mysticism, predestination, and Halakha which were not known to the patristic authors. These works were often quoted to support polemical arguments. Similarly, Amulo demonstrates his knowledge of Jewish texts to strengthen his position. It is clear from his writings that Scripture was insufficient; a wide base of Church scholarship fueled debates between dioceses over Christ's nature, Jewish tradition, and superstition. Both Amulo and Agobard strove to counter Jewish influence in Francia, and worked to convince Christians that they ought to limit their interaction with the Jewish population of Lyon.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 137. In both Agobard and Amulo's works, they express concern that Christians preferred to attend Jewish services rather than those of their own priests. Amulo objected to Jewish scholars Josephus and Philo in 844‚Äì845, and his writings were echoed by both Angelomus and Rabanus Maurus; these texts were becoming more popular amongst Christians than Scripture.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 129. There was also concern that close ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù contact between Jews and Christians in Lyon would lead to a widespread conversion to Judaism within their diocese.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos,\\" 136. Predestination Amulo was included among many prelates working to oppose Gottschalk of Orbais (c. 870) and his teachings of two-fold predestination. By 864, Gottschalk had settled in Friuli under the patronage of Eberhard and was covertly spreading his doctrine in Italy and Noricum.It has been suggested that \\"Civilia negotia\\" may also be translated as \\"public affairs.\\" This implies that Gottschalk's influence in Orbais reached beyond the ecclesiastical (see Genke, Gottschalk, 25.) He had followers in Saxony, Germany, and later in the Balkan regions. From the writings of Rabanus, it is clear that Gottschalk had gained sufficient popularity to pose a theological threat to the Church ‚Äì and not merely in the Carolingian heartlands of Francia.Genke, Gottschalk, 27. Gottschalk challenged both the structure and doctrine of the Church. He was raised in a monastery at Fulda, which was a focus for missionaries in Germany and central to Louis the Pious' vision of a \\"Christian\\" empire.Genke, Gottschalk, 46. As a monk, Gottschalk twice defied the Order of Saint Benedict: first, in 849 at a council at Mainz, he nearly succeeded in freeing himself from monkhood, when by rule he was born to serve from pueritia for life.Genke, Gottschalk, 15. Rabanus sought to ensure that Gottschalk did not set a precedent for other monks, and called a second council at the Diet of Worms in 829. Consequentially, Gottschalk was again \\"forced to take the monastic vows.\\" Second, Gottschalk defied the Benedictine law of stabilitas loci,Genke, Gottschalk, 25‚Äì26. by leaving his monastic duties for southwest Italy. Primarily, his motivations were political. Gottschalk was a disciple of Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims, and this connection rapidly became controversial. Ebbo sided with Lothair I against Louis during the civil war of 833, and was deposed when Louis returned to power. Ebbo spent the remainder of his life attempting to replace his successor, Hincmar. Around 833‚Äì835 Gottschalk was relocated to Orbais; but he was accused of conspiring with Ebbo against Hincmar and needed to escape persecution. Rigbold of Rheims briefly served as archbishop before Hincmar was appointed, from 835‚Äì845. Rigbold ordained Gottschalk as a missionary without the consent of bishop Rothad of Soissons, where Orbais was located. Gottschalk's ordination disrupted both monastic law and social order; he was later prosecuted at the 849 council in Quierzy (see Councils of Quierzy) for disturbing ‚Äúboth ecclesiastical and civil affairs.‚Äù The case of Gottschalk is relevant to Amulo's prelature in two ways: first, Gottschalk was an erudite theologian, and his Augustinian view of predestination cited the same Church Fathers present in Amulo's works. Notably, he was also supported by Prudentius of Troyes, in opposition to Hincmar. It is clear that Hincmar also began to have doubts: he wrote to five prelates from the church in Lyon for advice, including Amalarius. Amalarius was appointed by Louis to replace Agobard as archbishop in Lyon, where he served from 833‚Äì838. Among other prelates, Amalarius sided with Eriugena against Gottschalk in the predestination debate. However, his liturgical reforms ‚Äì emphasizing the ceremonial importance of both the Eucharist and Mass ‚Äì were seen as excessive by the Church. He was deposed and accused of heresy at the same council which condemned Gottschalk in 838. Agobard actively condemned Amalarius's liturgical methods, and was able to regain imperial favour. He was restored as archbishop in Lyon, and Amulo succeeded him upon his death. Royalty was almost always involved in matters of faith. In 849, King Charles the Bald himself began to ponder the issue of predestination.Genke, Gottschalk, 46‚Äì47. However, the draconian punishments administered by Hincmar at the council of Quierzy in 849 clearly affirm the power of Church hierarchies in ninth-century Francia.Genke, Gottschalk, 41. Florus of Lyon was highly critical of the verdict; it also clearly deviated from canon law.Genke, Gottschalk, 40‚Äì41. Gottschalk remained \\"convinced that his ideas were orthodox,\\"Genke, Gottschalk, 30. and he persisted in his controversial doctrines. There was no definitive end to the predestination debate, and the Church maintained its position. Gottschalk raised a long-dormant theological question, but the 860 synod in Tusey merely reaffirmed the Church's initial position.Jeffrey Burton Russell, Dissent and Reform in the Early Middle Ages (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1965), 157. Hincmar and his supporters were at an impasse with Gottschalk ‚Äì there was no room for dialogue, and Gottschalk was incarcerated at Hautvillers in 849 until his death. It was during this time that Amulo began to correspond with him. The tone of Amulo's letters imply that he may have viewed the stability and unity of the Church as a prerogative over the question of predestination. His Epistula ad Gothescalcum monachum or \\"Letter to Monk Gottschalk\\" is more reminiscent of paternal advice than theological attack.Russell, Dissent and Reform, 186. Similarly, his Opusculum Gratiam itaque Dei on \\"The Grace of God\\" asserts that predestination should primarily be viewed as an affirmation of Christian humility: it should not lead to \\"despair\\".Russell, Dissent and Reform, 200. Anti-Judaic polemic In both his anti-Judaic writings and his scholarship, it is unlikely that Amulo was motivated solely by anti-Semitism. He was mainly concerned by the power and influence held by Jews under the administration of King Charles the Bald.Russell, Dissent and Reform, 48. These tolerant policies towards Jews were a continuation of those of Emperor Louis the Pious. They allowed economic concessions and legal protection of Jews under the lex Judaica and were a sore point for some prelates in Frankish Gaul.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 84‚Äì106. Agobard epitomises the conflict of interest between the Church and Frankish state, and this tension carried over into Amulo's work. Agobard was known for his anti-Jewish campaigns and was involved in the revolt against Louis in 833.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 101. When Louis regained the throne in 834, Agobard was sent into exile and temporarily replaced by Amalarius of Metz, former Archbishop of Trier, who was more favourably disposed towards Jews.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 102. When Amalarius was condemned for heresy in 838, Agobard was reappointed as archbishop; despite his return to imperial favour, both Agobard and Amulo persisted in their anti-Judaic polemic. Amidst the chaos preceding the 843 Treaty of Verdun, Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims drafted a proposal with three primary aims: to reinforce ecclesiastical power by preventing laymen from becoming prelates; to reclaim all property that had been previously owned by the church; to eliminate all privileges granted to Jews during Louis' reign.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 107. Amulo was instrumental in the 846 Meaux-Paris council in the Diocese of Meaux, which planned the implementation of Hincmar's anti-Jewish policies.Blumenkranz, 124; Bachrach, 107. This council was a Church attempt to exercise power independently of the royal court ‚Äì but Charles formally rejected their proposal at √âpernay in 846, and made it clear that he intended to uphold his father's \\"pro-Jewish\\" policies. Amulo is listed among the attendees at this council.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 141. 200x200px Amulo experienced the same conflict of interest with Charles the Bald as his predecessor Agobard had with Louis the Pious. His treatise Liber contra Judaeos at Carolum regem or \\"Letter Against Jews to King Charles\\" comprehensively lays out his anti-Jewish theses. It is clear from Amulo's writings that Christian‚ÄìJewish interaction in Lyon was common.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 109‚Äì110. Amulo had three major concerns within his diocese: first, he was concerned with the popularity and influence of Jewish scholarship and anti-Christian texts. Jewish rabbis were also permitted to hold public services, and Amulo worried that Christians in Lyon were more interested in Jewish teachings than attending services within his diocese. Second, Jews could hold public office and encourage Christian or pagan conversion with secular incentives. This was particularly sensitive in matters of slavery or tax collection; in Contra Judaeos, Amulo asserts that \\"Jewish tax collectors\\" were converting Christians, particularly in less populated areas.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 109. Jews no longer had to pay a \\"religious tax\\", and in some cases, Jewish merchants were exempt from paying tolls or other imperial dues.Bachrach, Early Medieval Jewish Policy, 103. Third, Jews and Christians commonly shared traditions or daily practices. Many Christians chose to \\"work on Sunday\\" and \\"rest on the Jewish Sabbath\\", in part because Louis the Pious had changed market days to accommodate Jewish merchants.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 110. It was also common for Christians to celebrate Jewish feast days and eat kosher foods. Amulo was furthermore concerned over the liturgical versus doctrinal influence of Jewish beliefs ‚Äì he worried that the \\"mysticism\\" of Midrashim and \\"Talmudic traditions\\" would translate into Christian worship.Robert Bonfil, \\"Cultural and Religious Traditions in Ninth-Century French Jewry,\\" Jewish Intellectual History in the Middle Ages, BINAH vol. 3, ed. Joseph Dan (London: Praeger, 1994), 17. =Jewish scholarship= Jewish texts were widely circulated in the Carolingian world ‚Äì many of them, most notably the Toledot Yeshu, were blatantly anti-Christian.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 71. Amulo could likely read Hebrew or corresponded with those who could.A. L. Williams, \\"Amulo, Archbishop of Lyon,\\" in Adversus Judaeos: A Bird's Eye View of Christian Apologiae until the Renaissance (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1935), 360. Public worship for Jews was also legalised during the Carolingian period ‚Äì these reforms were subsequently upheld by Louis and his son Charles. Amulo is very specific in his criticisms of Hebraic scripture, but there are also cases where he conflates the Cthib (text-based) and Qri (oral) bibles.Williams, \\"Amulo\\", 361. This suggests that he could have relied on hear-say sources and not on texts themselves. The works of Jewish scholars were often popularised and highly respected; Charlemagne had allowed a strong Jewish intellectual presence in the empire, most notably with the scholar Kalonymus in Mainz and Isaac, imperial ambassador to Harun al-Rashid.Williams, \\"Amulo\\", 356. The emperor set a precedent for cultural and economic policies towards Jews, and a strong Judaic tradition rooted itself in Carolingian Gaul. This continued in the courts of Louis the Pious, where appreciation for both Josephus and Philo of Alexandria may account for their popularity throughout the Carolingian period; indeed, Josephus was treated almost like another \\"church father\\".H. Schreckenberg, \\"The Works of Josephus and the Early Christian Church,\\" Josephus, Judaism, and Christianity, ed. L. Feldman and G. Hata (Detroit 1987), 310 in Pollard, 69. Louis also allowed discussion of the \\"relative merits\\" of Christianity and Judaism to enter into intellectual circles.Russell, \\"Dissent and Reform\\", 167. Amulo reiterates the Jewish origin of both Josephus and Philo in his Liber contra Judaeos, and expresses his anxiety that these works were not to be overvalued by Christians. In the case of Josephus, it is possible that Amulo was reacting to the popularity of his work rather than its actual content. Among Josephus' works, two were widely read in their Latin forms: his Jewish War and Antiquities. Not only did his Antiquities contain an extensive anecdote in praise of Christianity in his Testimonium Flavianum, but the most popular translation of Josephus' history ‚Äì now called \\"Hegesippus\\" for its author Pseudo-Hegesippus ‚Äì openly discriminates against the Jewish people.For further discussion on the Latin translations of Josephus, see T. Leoni, \\"Translations and Adaptations of Josephus's Writings in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,\\" Ostraka 16.2 (2007), 481‚Äì492. The Jewish-Christian dispute quickly became a political one, with the conversion of the deacon Bodo, in 838. This was an uncomfortable affirmation of the clergy's worst fears: that the Jewish cultural and theological presence was sufficiently persuasive to earn Jewish converts, even in positions of power. Although Bodo resided in the court at Aachen, it was the clergy of the western kingdom who schemed to bring about anti-Jewish legislation.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 135. Bodo was a Christian noble, active in the Carolingian courts ‚Äì not only did his conversion set a dangerous precedent, but rumours that he encouraged Muslim persecution of Christians in Spain exacerbated the issue.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 114. In 848, there was also a suggestion that Jews assisted the Vikings in Bordeaux; the Annals of Saint Bertin (see Annales Bertiniani) also attest that Barcelona was \\"handed over\\" to the Muslims in 852, although later sections of the Annals were written by Hincmar himself.Genke, \\"Gottschalk\\", 53. =Jewish merchants and slave trade= The Second Council of M√¢con in 581‚Äì582 held that Jews could not own Christian slaves; this was reaffirmed at the Council of Ch√¢lons in 743.Williams, \\"Amulo\\", 349‚Äì350. However, Jewish merchants held considerable wealth and influence in the ninth century. In contrast to both Roman and canon law, Louis permitted Jews both to employ Christians and purchase pagan slaves. Jews were also elected to governmental positions, and could earn honores or imperial favours. Louis also amended the law obligating the release of any slave converted to either Judaism or Christianity.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 108. Slave owners were prohibited from active \\"proselytism\\" but their slaves could only convert to either religion with their consent.Bachrach, 108; Williams, 389. Under these conditions, it was more likely that slaves would become Jewish converts rather than Christian ones. Agobard was rightly concerned that slaves would be tempted to accept Judaism; this had already occurred in Lyon. After a Jewish-owned pagan girl was converted by her master, Agobard baptized her as a Christian.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 99. He faced strong resistance from the Jewish population in Lyon, and was held legally accountable for this act by the magister Judaeorum in 822. This was a humilitating defeat for Agobard; it confirmed the strong Jewish influence present in the imperial court. Louis even provided the Jews with a diploma, bearing his imperial seal, to affirm their \\"victory\\" against Agobard.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 99‚Äì101, 109. In 827, Agobard composed On Jewish Superstitions with the support of numerous prelates. He explicitly tells Christians to abstain from selling Christian slaves to Jewish merchants. It is clear from Agobard's letters that this practice was sufficiently common to generate anxiety in Lyon,Williams, \\"Amulo\\", 350. and this carried over into Amulo's work. Charles the Bald permitted many economic advantages for the Jews; as mint-masters, tax collectors, and bank owners, the Jews held significant financial power in the Frankish kingdoms.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 110‚Äì112. In the case of Radhanite merchants, flourishing economic activity in southern Gaul also extended into the Mediterranean and parts of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 112. As Islamic forces claimed hegemony over the Mediterranean, Christian trading networks out of Syria had largely disappeared ‚Äì leaving a strong power gap in the market for Carolingian Jews.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 72. It is here that many Jewish merchants spread their faith, and rumours that Gallic Christian slaves were being sold across the borders became a major controversy.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 96‚Äì97. There are many stories of Christians slaves being \\"redeemed\\" from their ownersMcCormick, Origins of the European Economy: Communications and Commerce AD 300‚Äì900, 609. and there were also rumours of \\"kidnapping\\" and forced castration by Jewish slave owners.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 96. Charles was aware of this power imbalance: he attempted to reform Louis' policies, most nobly prohibiting Jewish bankers to accept Christian slaves as \\"collateral\\" for unpaid debts.Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 75. Amulo was rightly concerned that the Jewish monopoly over tax-collection and trade put Charles into a tight political position; in his Contra Judeos, Amulo encourages Charles to reconsider a more ‚Äúanti-Jewish policy.\\"Bachrach, \\"Jewish Policy\\", 111. 242x242px Relics and icons In his Epistula ad Teodboldum to Theutbald I (bishop of Langres), Amulo advises the Bishop on how to deal with the bones of an unknown saint that were brought to the Church of St. B√©nigne in Dijon. This letter was probably written between 841 and 844, since it refers to Bishop Bartholomew of Narbonne, who died in 845. Not only was Amulo concerned about the ‚Äúridiculous manner‚Äù in which these two dubious monks delivered the relics,Charles West, \\"The Letter of Amolo Archbishop of Lyons to Theobald bishop of Langres,\\" The University of Sheffield: Department of History. http://history.dept.shef.ac.uk/translations/medieval/amolo/#_edn6. but certain miracula had started to occur after the bones were buried at St. B√©nigne (see Dijon Cathedral). These ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù did not cure or heal visitors of the relics: several women within the diocese reported getting ‚Äústrikings‚Äù, though they showed no signs of outward injury.West, \\"Unauthorised Miracles\\", 295.Bobrycki, \\"Flailing Women of Dijon,\\" 18-19. They also experienced fits, resembling those of modern epilepsy. According to Amulo, Bishop Martin of Tours once avoided visiting a popular shrine, since he did not know the name of the martyr buried at the site. Amulo was careful not to denounce the sanctity of the relics while he is concerned about the likelihood of them being unholy; he finally advised Theobald to remove them and bury them elsewhere. Bishop Theobald most likely listened to this advice, since the relics are not mentioned further in surviving sources.West, \\"Unauthorised Miracles\\", 296. Amulo's Epistula ad Teodboldum was written during a time of civil war, in which the diocese of Dijon was sensitively positioned. Louis the German and Charles the Bald had engaged in combat within the area, and the subsequent devastation profoundly affected the diocese.West, \\"Unauthorised Miracles\\", 298. Amulo was deeply concerned about the effects that the relics had on families: most of the fits occurred in women and young girls, keeping them from their duties and generating more anxiety within the parish.West, \\"Unauthorised Miracles\\", 305. Amulo was not against relics, but he asserted the importance of venerating saints in ‚Äúproper‚Äù ways, and that such things should be limited to the ‚Äúlegitimate days\\".West, \\"The Letter of Amolo\\". He offered a solution to these new relics, insisting that church ceremony ‚Äì Mass, confessions, burials ‚Äì would restore the people through ‚Äúeveryday miracles of everyday life\\".West, \\"Unauthorised Miracles\\", 304. Major works =Contra Judaeos= By 843, the archbishopric of Lyon was part of Middle Francia under the kingship of Lothair. The Epistola seu liber contra Judaeos was dedicated to Charles the Bald in West Francia, approximately dated c. 843‚Äì846. It was written to persuade the king to approve the anti-Jewish policies proposed at the Council of Paris-Meaux.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos\\", 140. Many of Amulo's letters were sent through Archbishop Hincmar of Reims. Hincmar had assembled the 843 Assembly of Coulaines, at which Charles the Bald made a formal pact of peace, or foedus concordiae, with the Church. Hincmar knew that Amulo was well-versed in Jewish teachings. Hincmar selected Amulo to expose the Jewish threat to the king with his Epistula. He wanted to use the foedus concordiae as leverage between Church and state in implementing anti-Jewish policies. Contra Judaeos can be divided into three themes: first, Amulo provides a list of Jewish ‚Äúblasphemies‚Äù against the Christian faith.Williams, \\"Amulo\\", 359. He refers directly to sections of the Toledot Yeshu and Hebrew bible, and cites scripture to support his argument. Secondly, Amulo provides a critique of Jewish scholars Josephus and Philo. He then goes further, describing the ‚Äúill behaviour‚Äù of the Judaic people in the Frankish Empire; most of which was directly taken from Agobard's writings.Williams, \\"Amulo\\", 363. He concludes Contra Judaeos with a caution to all Christians, and uses historical examples to set a leading precedent for Charles the Bald. In his Epistula, Amulo carefully lays out his theological argument against Jewish scripture. Christianity was not valued as a legitimate denomination in these texts; it was merely seen as a deviation from the true Jewish faith. Apostles were openly called ‚Äúapostates‚Äù and the Gospel was being taught as ‚Äúthe revelation of iniquity‚Äù or havongalion by Jewish priests. The Toledot Yeshu and other Jewish works also contested the legitimacy of Jesus's birth, and these claims are addressed in great detail by Amulo. Primarily, two versions of the Messiah are addressed in the Contra Judaeos. The first attests that Jesus was merely a descendant of King David; he was later enslaved and kept chained to a cave wall outside of Rome. Attended by a Jewish doctor named Joshua ben Levi, the wounded man transforms into an old sage. He carries a sapphire stone, and promises to distribute such stones among the people once he has liberated them.Williams, \\"Amulo\\", 360. The second asserts that the Messiah is a man called Ben Ephraim, or son of Joseph, destined to perish in combat against Gog and Magog. Amulo deconstructs both heresies, citing both from the Old Testament and Hebraic texts. Amulo notes that the Toledot re-words lines of the Vulgate bible, specifically Isaiah 53:5 and Zechariah 12:10, to support their claim. The Carolingians were instrumental in standardizing the Vulgate; this often involved cross-referencing with Hebrew scripture. Florus was active in revising the psalter used at Lyon, and cites \\"the Septuagint, Jerome, and 'The Books of the Hebrews'\\" in his revisions.Albert, \\"Adversus Iudaeos,\\" 123. Amulo also cites Jerome in his Contra Judaeos, who interpreted Ezekiel 4:4‚Äì6 to say that the first captivity should have been limited to 430 years; only half of the estimate that Amulo gives. He also cites Scripture to provide evidence against the Jewish re-telling of Christ's crucifixion, specifically referring to the time of day.Williams, \\"Amulo,\\" 360‚Äì362. Amulo's attention to detail makes it clear that the anti-Christian polemic had a strong public presence in Lyon, and was sufficiently influential to warrant his concern. The Contra Judaoes was an opportunity for Amulo to deconstruct the many Jewish and anti-Christian texts that were in circulation during his time; it is also a testament to the breadth of his scholarship. He routinely cites the Church Fathers, including Augustine, Jerome, and Pope Gregory the Great. He also uses historical precedents to support his argument, including the laws of Theodosius I, Valentinus, Constantine, and Childebert I. He mentions the conversion of the Jews by King Sisebut in 612, and notes that Pope Gregory praised King Reccared for his anti-Jewish laws (see The Third Council of Toledo). It is clear that Amulo did not intend to convert Jews, but to fully remove them from the empire: citing St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, he insists that Christians may ‚Äúmourn‚Äù Jews, but should not try to ‚Äúsave them.‚ÄùWilliams, \\"Amulo\\", 364. =Letters= Epistula ad Gothescalcum monachum or \\"Letter to Monk Gottschalk\\" (850‚Äì851) (PL 119:422; MGH Epist. 5, 1898-9/1978, 368‚Äì78)For an English translation, see Genke, 186‚Äì199. addressed seven theses of Gottschalk of Orbais. An anonymous postscript entitled \\"Grace of God\\" or Opusculum Gratiamitque Dei has led some scholars to believe the work was written by Florus of Lyon, although both the letter and opusculum are ascribed to Amulo. The letter mostly focuses on the debate of predestination. According to the letter, Gottschalk's writings were being circulated both among the dioceses and the public; his treatises also attacked bishops who were present at the 849 Council of Quierzy.Genke, \\"Gottschalk\\", 44. Epistula ad imperatorem de babtizandis Hebraeis or \\"Letter to the Hebrews on Baptism\\" (816, 822/825) (PL 119:422; MGH Epist. 5, 1898/1978, 239)‚ÄúAmulo Lugdunensis,‚Äù in Clavis des auteurs latins du Moyen √Çge, territoire francais, 735‚Äì987, vol. 1, ed.

Sources make the date of composition or authorship unclear: it has been attributed to both Amulo and Remigius. Attempts at dating the letter suggest it may have been written earlier by Agobard, or yet remains anonymous. Epistula ad Teodboldum Lingonensem episcopum or \\"Letter to Theutbald Bishop of Langres\\" (841‚Äì844) (PL 116:77‚Äì84; MGH Epist. 5 1898-9/1978, 363‚Äì8)‚ÄúAmulo Lugdunensis,‚Äù in Clavis des auteurs latins du Moyen √Çge, territoire francais, 735‚Äì987, vol. 1, ed.

It contains sixty chapters, some of which resemble direct copies from Agobard. It would likely have been compiled by Florus, but largely attributes its authorship to Amulo.‚ÄúAmulo Lugdunensis,‚Äù in Clavis des auteurs latins du Moyen √Çge, territoire francais, 735‚Äì987, vol. 1, ed.

For a more comprehensive summary of Contra Judaeos, see the above section. =Opusculum= Opusculum \\"Gratiam itaque Dei\\" or \\"The Grace of God\\" (PL 116:97‚Äì100; also 116:101‚Äì106) dates around the same period as both the Epistula ad Gothescalcum and Sententiae ex libris Augustini. Found without an attribution, its association with the aforementioned letters implies it was penned either by Amulo or Florus. It emphasises the grace of God and discusses both free will and predestination; it also iterates the promise of salvation for Christians and references the work of St Augustine. Opusculum \\"Omnipotens Deus\\" or \\"Almighty God\\" (849) (PL 116:97‚Äì100; also listed under Florus: PL 119:95‚Äì102; 125:57‚Äì9)‚ÄúAmulo Lugdunensis,‚Äù in Clavis des auteurs latins du Moyen √Çge, territoire francais, 735‚Äì987, vol. 1, ed.

It is written as a response to an unknown man regarding the issue of predestination and free will. It is included in the Patrologia Latina with Amulo's edits, and prefaces a work by Hincmar of Reims entitled On Predestination. Two copies of this text were in circulation ‚Äì one of which has been attributed to Archbishop Herribald of Auxerre (828‚Äì57) and the other to Florus of Lyon.‚ÄúAmulo Lugdunensis,‚Äù in Clavis des auteurs latins du Moyen √Çge, territoire francais, 735‚Äì987, vol. 1, ed.M.

It is located in the eastern edge of the city. It was founded in the beginning of the 20th century as a working neighborhood situated on the outskirts of the urban perimeter. Its growth accompanied the development of the Bavaria brewery, in the nearby San Diego neighborhood.  History  Its development is related to establishment the Bavaria brewery. Many residents of the Egipto and Bel√©n neighborhoods moved to the areas above San Diego with the support of Leo Kopp, who founded the brewing company in 1889.Historia de Bogot√° ‚Äî Siglo XX, p√°g. 32. The northern limit of the neighborhood is at Carrera Cuarta. The first buildings were made mostly of adobe and raised in the early 1910s on 4.30√ó8-meter plots. It was inaugurated on 1 May 1914 and was called the Plaza de Trabajo. In its center is situated the Monumento al Trabajo. The consolidation of the neighborhood was slowed because some of the homes were built by the residents at different and on different schedules while some lots were allocated to the raising of corn, potatoes and vegetables during times when there were resources for the construction. Afterwards there was difficulty with installation of public services which were already common in the rest of the city. Northeastern boundary of the neighbourhood, near the Parque nacional Enrique Olaya Herrera During this period, la Perseverancia received water from the Chorro de Padilla or Rio Arzobispo. This situation resulted in the construction of water reservoirs in Carrera S√©ptima at Calle Treinta Y Uno, and another where a church is currently found. Because of the lack of electricity, illumination included wax candles and coal or wood- burning stoves. The boys of the neighborhood often had to collect firewood from the Eastern mountain range. During the second half of the 1940s the neighborhood was an area of support for the politician, Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, where a march by torchlight known as the Marcha de las Antorchas was held on his behalf. Stage at the Festival de la chicha, la vida, y la dicha  Boundaries  On the north, it is bounded by the Colegio San Bartolom√© La Merced school along Calle Treinta y tres. Its southern edge separates it of the La Macarena neighborhood along Calle Treinta y Uno. Along the western side, it is separated from the San Mart√≠n and La Merced neighborhoods by Carrera Quinta (Fifth Avenue), and its eastern boundary marks the urban perimeter along Carrera Primera, which is located a few blocks further up from the Avenida Circunvalar.  Works  Some of the notable buildings in the neighborhood are the Plaza Distrital de Mercado on Carrera Quinta at Calle Treinta, and the Templo de Jesucristo Obrero.  Events  Many of the neighborhood homes used to sell homemade alcoholic beverages which are now symbolic of the annual Festival de la Chicha, la Vida y la Dicha held every October. La Perseverancia is also known for its tradition of manufacturing artisanal fireworks. Carrera Quinta near the Plaza Distrital de Mercado  Transportation  Along the eastern and western limits, the neighborhood counts on two avenues which connect it to the rest of the city. The Carrera Quinta goes to the downtown and eastern parts of the city through its connection to Avenida El Dorado while the Avenida Circunvalar provides access to the north.

The embassy provides assistance to American citizens and residents who live in Venezuela and issues visas to foreign nationals, who are Venezuelan and legal residents in Venezuela, who wish to visit or immigrate to the United States. The United States has not had an ambassador to Venezuela since July 2010 when Patrick Duddy finished his assignment. Since July 2018, the embassy has been led by the charge d'affaires James \\"Jimmy\\" Story, after President Nicol√°s Maduro ordered the expulsion of Todd D. Robinson in May 2018. History = Punto Fijo Pact = On 1958, shortly after the overthrow of Venezuelan dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, Vice President of the United States Richard Nixon's motorcade was attacked in Caracas during his 1958 goodwill tour of South America. Nixon ended up unharmed and his entourage managed to reach the U.S. embassy. Two different accounts explain how Nixon's car was ultimately able to escape the mob and continue to the embassy. According to one version of events, the U.S. press corps' flatbed truck, accompanying the motorcade, was used to clear a path through the crowd. In Nixon's remembrance of the incident, Associated Press photographer Hank Griffin at one point had to use his camera to beat back a protester who tried to mount the truck. According to a second account, soldiers of the Venezuelan Army arrived and cleared the traffic, thereafter moving the mob back at bayonet-point to allow Nixon's car to pass. Shortly after the Nixons arrived at the embassy, the Venezuelan army surrounded and fortified the chancellery, reinforcing the small U.S. Marine guard force. Their assistance had earlier been requested by the U.S. ambassador. That afternoon, members of the ruling junta arrived at the embassy and lunched with Nixon. The next morning, representatives of Venezuela's major labor unions came to the embassy and requested an audience with Nixon, which was granted. The union leaders apologized for events of the preceding day. Additional activities were canceled, and Nixon departed Caracas the next morning, seven hours early. His motorcade to the airport was protected by a major deployment of Venezuelan Army infantry and armored forces in the capital. Nixon described having taken the same route as before, whose streets were empty and heavy patrolled after the whole area had been tear-gassed. On 17 February 1976, gunmen fired at the embassy from a car, leaving no injuries and causing minimal damage. =Hugo Ch√°vez= During the presidencies of Hugo Ch√°vez and Nicol√°s Maduro, relations between Venezuela and the United States deteriorated. On 11 September 2008, Ambassador Patrick Duddy left Venezuela after Ch√°vez claimed that he was involved in an American-led initiative to remove him from office. Duddy eventually returned to his position in July 2009 but after his assignment ended in July 2010, Ch√°vez refused a replacement for the ambassador, which would be Larry Leon Palmer. =Nicol√°s Maduro= On 2 March 2015, President Maduro accused the United States of plotting a coup against him and demanded that the Embassy of the United States in Caracas reduce its staff from over 200 workers to 17 individuals within two weeks. With about 232,500 applications made through the embassy in 2014, this created fears that difficulties would arise for the demand of visas by Venezuelans. Despite Maduro's orders, the staff did not change at the embassy. In December 2017, Todd D. Robinson was appointed by President Donald Trump to be charge d'affairs en pied at the embassy in Caracas, Venezuela. In January 2018, Robinson attempted to obtain the release of American citizen, Joshua Holt who had been jailed in the country by meeting with Venezuelan foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza. On 22 May the same year, Robinson and his deputy, Brian Naranjo were expelled from the country as persona non grata by Nicolas Maduro, the newly re-elected president. Days later, Joshua Holt was freed and allowed to return to the USA. On 23 January 2019, Maduro announced the unilateral breakdown of diplomatic relations with the United States, giving 72 hours to US diplomatic officials to leave the country. The decision came after President Donald Trump recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as interim president of Venezuela. On 12 March 2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced over Twitter that the US would withdraw all remaining personnel from the embassy within the week, citing the increasingly deteriorating situation in the country. On 5 April 2019, the United States signed a protecting power agreement with Switzerland to represent its interests in Venezuela, however, the agreement is not yet operational as it has not been approved by Maduro's governmenthttps://ahvalnews.com/venezuela-turkey/maduros-venezuelan-govt- proposes-turkey-protecting-power- embassyhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/venezuela-proposes-turkey-to-be- protecting-po-622463.html due to the United States rejecting Maduro's government's proposal to have Turkey as its protecting power as the United States only recognizes Guaid√≥ as interim president.http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/venezuela-proposes-turkey-as- protecting-power-143463https://uwidata.com/3684-venezuela-asks-turkey-to- serve-as-a-protecting-power/ In the meantime, the United States has instead established a \\"Venezuela Affairs Unit\\" section at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia to serve as an interim diplomatic office to Venezuela.https://www.state.gov/creation-of-the-venezuela-affairs-unit/ Works Organized through the embassy, classes teaching the English language are offered at Bi-National Centers in the cities of Caracas, Maracaibo, and M√©rida. Poor high school students in Venezuela are also taught English language classes and United States culture through the English Access Microscholarship Program while the Youth Ambassadors Program sends Venezuelan students in high school for three weeks of studies. The International Visitor Leadership Program allows Venezuelan professionals to visit the United States to observe their American counterparts. Due to the approval of the United States by Venezuelans, demand and popularity for such programs are very high and competitive. The visa system of the embassy works by accepting payments and applications made in advance online. Appointments are then made after applying online, with individuals required to arrive early and wait in line to make sure they fit into their designated appointments.

The remains have been found in the Maastrichtian stage of the Hell Creek Formation, dated to the very end of the Mesozoic era, making Dakotaraptor one of the last surviving dromaeosaurids. The remains of D. steini were discovered in a multi-species bonebed. Elements of the holotype and referred specimens were later found to belong to trionychid turtles, and further analysis of potential non-dromaeosaurid affinities of the holotype and referred material have not yet been conducted. Phylogenetic analyses of D. steini place it in a variety of positions in the Dromaeosauridae. Discovery and naming Skeletal composite showing the known elements In 2005, paleontologist Robert DePalma in Harding County, South Dakota discovered a fluvial bonebed bearing the remains of a variety of dinosaurian and non-dinosaurian remains, which yielded a partial skeleton attributed by DePalma to a large dromaeosaurid. Subsequently, the same site produced additional dromaeosaurid remains. In 2015, the type species Dakotaraptor steini was named and described by Robert A. DePalma, David A. Burnham, Larry Dean Martin, Peter Lars Larson and Robert Thomas Bakker. The generic name, Dakotaraptor, combines a reference to South Dakota and the Dakota people with the Latin word raptor, meaning \\"plunderer\\". The specific name, steini, honours paleontologist Walter W. Stein. Dakotaraptor was one of eighteen dinosaur taxa from 2015 to be described in open access or free-to-read journals. Proposed furcula compared with other theropod dinosaurs. Said furcula was later shown to be an element from a trionychid turtle. The holotype, PBMNH.P.10.113.T, was found in a sandstone layer of the upper Hell Creek Formation, dating from the late Maastrichtian. It consists of a partial skeleton, lacking the skull, of an adult individual. It contains a piece of a back vertebra, ten tail vertebrae, both humeri, both ulnae, both radii, the first and second right metacarpals, three claws of the left hand, a right thighbone, both shinbones, a left astragalus bone, a left calcaneum, the left second, third and fourth metatarsal, the right fourth metatarsal, and the second and third claw of the right foot. An assigned furcula was later excluded from the specimen. Apart from the remains of the holotype, in the site bones were discovered that also belonged to Dakotaraptor but which represented a more gracile morph. These included the specimens PBMNH.P.10.115.T: a right shinbone; PBMNH.P.10.118.T: a connected left astragalus and calcaneum; and KUVP 152429: originally identified as a furcula, but now also excluded from the known remains of Dakotaraptor. Additionally four isolated teeth were referred, specimens PBMNH.P.10.119.T, PBMNH.P.10.121.T, PBMNH.P.10.122.T, and PBMNH.P.10.124.T. These fossils are part of the collection of The Palm Beach Museum of Natural History. Other referred fossils are KUVP 156045, an isolated tooth, and NCSM 13170, a third supposed furcula later identified as not belonging to Dakotaraptor. Description =Size= A restored replica of the Dakotaraptor holotype compared to silhouettes of Deinonychus, Velociraptor and a human Dakotaraptor is exceptionally large for a dromaeosaurid; it has an estimated adult length of . In 2016 other estimations suggested a length of 4.35-6 m (14.3-19.7 ft) in length and 220-350 kg (485-772 lbs) in weight. This approaches the size of the largest known dromaeosaurid, Utahraptor. Dakotaraptor however, does not have the proportions and adaptations of Utahraptor, but more closely resembles smaller dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. =Distinguishing traits= Apart from the large size, the description of 2015 indicated some additional distinguishing traits. On the fourth foot claw, the boss that serves as an attachment for the tendon of the flexor muscle is reduced in size. The \\"blood groove\\" on the outer side of the fourth claw of the foot, towards the tip is fully enclosed over half of its length, forming a bony tubular structure. The second and third claws of the foot have sharp keels at their undersides. The second foot claw, the \\"sickle claw\\", equals 29% of the thighbone length. On the shinbone, the crista fibularis, the crest that contacts the calfbone, is long and lightly built with a height that does not exceed 9% of the crest length. The upper edge of this crest ends in a hook. On the second metacarpal, of the two condyles that contact the finger, the inner one is almost as large as the outer one. The outer side of the second metacarpal has but a shallow groove for the ligament that connects it to the third metacarpal. When the arm is seen in a flat position, of the second metacarpal the edge between the wrist joint and the upper shaft is straight in top view. The teeth have fifteen to twenty denticles per on the rear edges and twenty to twenty-seven denticles on the front edges. =Skeleton= Vertebral column Life restoration by Emily Willoughby, 2015 The vertebrae of the back are highly pneumatised, filled with trabecular bone that shows many air spaces. On the middle tail vertebrae the front joint processes, the prezygapophyses, are extremely elongated with an estimated intact length of , spanning about ten vertebrae. This stiffens the tail. Forelimb Like virtually all other theropods, Dakotaraptor likely possessed a furcula, or ‚Äúwishbone‚Äù, as part of the shoulder girdle. Theropod wishbones are quite varied and often different from the strongly U-shaped furculae most modern birds possess; the elements originally identified as the furcula of Dakotaraptor were U- to V-shaped, similar to many other dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor, and even the large spinosaurid theropod Suchomimus. In 2015, a study by Victoria Megan Arbour et al. proposed that the presumed Dakotaraptor furculae in fact represented a part of a turtle armour, the entoplastron of Axestemys splendida, a member of the Trionychidae. In 2016, DePalma et al. recognized that none of the referred furculae actually belonged to Dakotaraptor, and excluded them from its hypodigm. The wing of Dakotaraptor was given much attention in the describing article. Here, ‚Äúwing‚Äù is used as an anatomical descriptive term not related to its functionality, since Dakotaraptor was flightless. This is similar to the term ‚Äúwing‚Äù for the same appendages in ostriches, emus, and other flightless birds. It is meant to express that arm is equipped with long feathers. Many of the wing bones were discovered (humerus, radius, ulna, two of the three metacarpal wrist bones, and parts of the finger digits), so the wing is very complete. The humerus, the upper arm bone, is relatively long and slender. It is somewhat bent to the inside. The most notable anatomical feature is the row of very prominent bumps along a ridge on the lower edge of the ulna, one of the forearm bones. These are called ulnar papillae, or quill knobs. In birds and some other theropod dinosaurs, these bumps were spots for reinforced attachment of the remiges, or wing feathers. When quill knobs are present, this is considered a strong indication that the animal had long remiges on the wings. Since quill knobs are rare in the fossil record, paleontologists mainly relied on phylogenetic bracketing to determine if a species was likely to have had wing feathers - if a relative on a \\"higher\\" branch of the evolutionary tree had the feathers, and one on a \\"lower\\" branch down had them also, then a species in the middle position likely did as well. Dakotaraptor‚Äôs quill knobs show that the animal unequivocally had prominent wing feathers, making it the largest dromaeosaurid with confirmed plumage of that type. The quill knobs of Dakotaraptor have a diameter of about , which shows that these feathers were rather large. It was estimated that a complete series might include fifteen of these papillae ulnares. The ulna is long and the other lower arm bone, the radius, measures . The hand bones show that their joints allowed for little mobility. The wingspan of Dakotaraptor was estimated at , not taking into account possible primary remiges longer than the hand. The second metacarpal of the metacarpus of the hand, the bone that primary remiges attach to, also had a flat bony shelf as its dorsal surface. The shelf made a perfect spot for the primary feathers to lay across in their life-attachment. Hindlimb The foot claws of the Dakotaraptor holotype, showing the flexor tubercles for muscle attachment Overall, the hindlimb is built lightly and with long elements, contrary to the robust, stocky hind limbs of Utahraptor. Dakotaraptor more closely resembles the agile, springy smaller dromaeosaurids and would have been well-suited at running and pursuit predation. The length of the thighbone is . It is relatively shorter and more lightly built than that of Utahraptor. To the contrary the shinbone is rather elongated. The holotype shinbone is, with a length of , the longest dromaeosaurid tibia known. It is 22% longer than the thighbone, indicating a good running capability. The shinbone's cnemial crest has a sharp corner pointing to the front. Its fibular crest ends in a hook-shaped process pointing to above, a condition that is unique in the entire Theropoda. The astragalus and calcaneum, the upper ankle bones, are fused just as in Bambiraptor. The top of the calcaneum has but a small contact facet for the calfbone, indicating that this fibula must have had a very narrow lower end. The metatarsus has an estimated length of , which makes it rather long relative to the remainder of the hindlimb. The foot claws of Dakotaraptor include a typical dromaeosaurid raptorial second claw, or \\"sickle claw\\", which was used for killing or holding down prey. It is large and robust with a diameter of and a length of measured along the outer curve. This equals 29% of the length of the thighbone, compared to 23% in Deinonychus. The claw is transversely flattened and has a droplet-shaped cross-section. The flexor tubercle, a large bump near the base, served as an attachment site for flexor muscles - the larger it was, the greater the slashing strength. Dakotaraptor has a flexor tubercle that is larger relative to overall claw size than it is in other discovered dromaeosaurids, potentially giving it the strongest slashing strength of any known member of this group. The flexor tubercle on the third claw of the foot is almost non-existent, very reduced in size compared to other dromaeosaurids, suggesting a more minimized use of that claw. As these are the bony cores of the claws, they would have been covered in a keratinous sheath that extended the \\"nail\\" and ended in a sharp tip. The third claw too is keeled but is much smaller with a tip to joint length of and a curve length of . The groove on its outer side towards the tip ends in a bone tunnel, a rare condition. Classification Comparison between Dakotaraptor and other giant Dromaeosaurids Dakotaraptor was placed in the Dromaeosauridae. A cladistic analysis showed that it was the sister species of Dromaeosaurus. They again formed a clade with Utahraptor, of which clade Achillobator was the direct side branch. Despite being related to other gigantic dromaeosaurids, Dakotaraptor was suggested to represent a separate fourth instance of dromaeosaurid size increase, besides Deinonychus, Unenlagia, and the Achillobator plus Utahraptor clade. A recent study conducted by Hartman et al. 2019, proposed a placement of Dakotaraptor in the \\"Unenlagiidae\\". If this study proves correct, then Dakotaraptor would have been one of the northernmost genera of Unenlagiine known. Graph comparing tooth dimensions of Dakotaraptor with those of other theropods In the recently performed phylogenetic by Currie and Evans in 2019, Dakotaraptor was again recovered as an eudromaeosaur, though the authors noted that the holotype may not represent one individual. In their description of Dineobellator, Jasinski et al. (2020) corroborated this position for Dakotaraptor, but also noted the likely status of Dakotaraptor as a chimaera, casting doubt on this placement as too basal due to the potential composite nature of the taxon. =Possible synonymy with Acheroraptor= Acheroraptor temertyorum is another theropod from the Hell Creek Formation, named in 2013 for a lower jaw, a maxilla, and some teeth. Acheroraptor was diagnosed by multiple features, including the possession of ridges on the teeth. Teeth are the only overlapping features between Acheroraptor and Dakotaraptor. However Acheroraptor is significantly smaller, and differs from Dakotaraptor only in that it possesses vertical ridges on the teeth crowns. Andrea Cau noted that though Dakotaraptor is known from individuals of differing sizes, some of the smaller specimens are also fully mature, and it is possible that the size difference means Dakotaraptor is simply a different species or size morph of Acheroraptor. A phylogenetic analysis presented by Cau, though relying on fragmentary specimens, did not result in a close relationship between the two. Paleobiology Dakotaraptor might have used its arms to keep its balance while subduing prey; here Ornithomimus is the victim The keeled claw of the second toe, the \\"sickle claw\\", was used to bring down prey and had a more robust flexor tubercle than that of Utahraptor. To the contrary, the third foot claw was relatively smaller in size than with other dromaeosaurids and seems not to have had an important function in attacking prey animals. Two morphs, a robust and a gracile one, were present in the fossil material. A study of the bone histology showed that both morphs were adult, so the lighter build of some bones was not caused by a young age. Individual variety or pathologies might account for the difference but the simplest explanation is sexual dimorphism. It can as yet not be deduced which morph was male and which female. On the ulna of the lower arm, wide papillae ulnares or quill knobs are present, attachment points for large pennaceous feathers. Adult Dakotaraptor individuals were much too heavy to fly. Despite this flightless condition, the feathers were not reduced. There is a variety of possible alternative functions for its wings, including shielding of eggs, display, intimidation and keeping balance while pinning down prey with the sickle claw. These functions however, do not necessitate quill knobs and the describing authors considered it likely that Dakotaraptor descended from a smaller flying ancestor which had them. Paleoecology Dakotaraptor compared to contemporaneous fauna of the Hell Creek Formation (Dakotaraptor in caramel brown) Dakotaraptor is the first medium-sized predator discovered in the Hell Creek Formation (aside from the dubious Nanotyrannus), intermediate in length between gigantic tyrannosaurids like Tyrannosaurus and smaller Deinonychosaurians like Acheroraptor. Its shinbone was longer than its thighbone, Dakotaraptor would have had a good running capacity, filling the niche of pursuit predator. Especially if it was a pack-hunter, cooperating in groups, it could have preyed upon larger herbivores, possibly competing with subadult tyrannosaurids in the length range. It lived alongside other famous dinosaurs, such as: Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Pachycephalosaurus, Ornithomimus and Edmontosaurus.

In higher power cultures subordinates are less likely to question their superiors. The crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in 1997 was attributed to the pilot's decision to land despite the junior officer's disagreement, while the crash of Avianca Flight 52 was caused by the failure to communicate critical low-fuel data between pilots and controllers, and by the failure of the controllers to ask the pilots if they were declaring an emergency and assist the pilots in landing the aircraft. The crashes have been blamed on aspects of the national cultures of the crews. Cultural differences in aviation Geert Hofstede classified national cultures into four dimensions, two of which can be applied to the flight deck: power distance, which defines the \\"nature of relations between subordinates and superiors\\", or \\"how often subordinates are afraid to express disagreement\\"; and whether the culture is collectivist or individualist in nature. Western cultures are individualistic and have a low power distance, whereas most Asian and Latin cultures are on the other side of the spectrum. Low power-distance and high individualism in Western culture may have contributed to a better safety record than in Taiwan and India. In a more collectivist society like Taiwan, a possible explanation for this might be that personal decision-making skills are not as developed. In Western society, the power-distance is lower in general; \\"making decisions, implementing them, and taking responsibility for their consequences\\" is part of their life, making personal decisions easier to make.  Past incidents  = Tenerife Disaster = Wreckage of Tenerife airport disaster On March 27, 1977, two Boeing 747 passenger jets, KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736, collided on the foggy runway at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport), on the Spanish island of Tenerife, Canary Islands, killing 583 people, making it the deadliest accident in aviation history. Before takeoff, the KLM flight engineer expressed his concern about the Pan Am not being clear of the runway by asking the pilots in his own cockpit, \\"Is he not clear, that Pan American?\\" The KLM captain emphatically replied \\"Oh, yes\\" and continued with the takeoff, snubbing the junior officer's concern. This event led to widespread establishment of crew resource management as a fundamental part of airline pilots' training.Baron, Robert. \\"The Cockpit, the Cabin, and Social Psychology\\". Global Operators Flight Information Resource. Retrieved May 11, 2011. = Korean Air Flight 801 = Animation of Korean 801 on approach On approach to Guam in 1997, Korean Air Flight 801 crashed, mainly due to pilot fatigue and poor communication between the flight crew. The captain made the decision to land despite the junior officer's disagreements, eventually bringing the plane down short of the runway, highlighting how a pilot can contribute to a disaster. In high power distance cultures, it is uncommon for subordinates to question their superiors. \\"Leaders may be autocratic\\". High power distance can be seen as the willingness to be in an unequal position, making it a challenge for an officer lower in the hierarchy to question the decisions of the one in power. At the same time, even in a high uncertainty avoidance culture, with the crew more likely to follow standard operating procedures (SOPs), the crew might react less efficiently to a novel situation. = Avianca Flight 52 = Similar model of Avianca 52. Avianca Flight 52 from Bogot√° to New York crashed after running out of fuel, a problem caused by language and cultural barriers. Both crew spoke Spanish as their primary language, but the first officer had better proficiency in English. \\"Colombia is a highly masculine, high power distance, and collectivist country\\", which might have led to the crew's reluctance to ask for help from the New York controllers when they knew they were in trouble. = JAL Cargo Flight 8054 = In 1977, JAL Cargo Flight 8054 (a cargo aircraft) crashed shortly after takeoff from Anchorage en route to Tokyo, killing all 3 crew. The captain was a US national, with the other two being Japanese. Neither Japanese pilot mentioned the captain's intoxication or stopped him from flying the plane. They were reluctant to do so, and given Japan's moderately high power-distance index, their deference to authority could have been a major contributing factor. Had they done so, it would have humiliated the captain, who was clearly their superior, and from there on, it was impossible \\"to prevent the captain from taking control of the aircraft, even at the cost of an accident.\\"  Other impacts of culture in airline safety  Although crew resource management (CRM) can improve safety in the aviation industry, it is not widely accepted across all cultures. This is likely due to differences in uncertainty avoidance, or \\"the need for rule- governed behavior and clearly defined procedures\\". Standard operating procedures are more easily accepted in high uncertainty avoidance cultures, such as Greece, Korea, and some Latin cultures. In the United States, however, where flexibility is emphasized, pilots may not be as accepting of CRM culture. Improvements can be made to CRM by drawing on the strengths of both individualistic and collectivisic cultures. Western assertiveness can be helpful in developing a low power-distance cockpit, while the Eastern interdependence brings cooperation, interdependence, and communication to create a safer flying environment. Ideally, \\"CRM represents low power distance (free exchange of information among the crew) and collectivism (recognition and acceptance of crew interdependence), a rare cultural combination.\\"  References  Category:Aviation safety ","title":"Impact of culture on aviation safety"},{"id":"48416768","text":"Nate Jones On Bass Nate Jones, professionally known as \\"Nate Jones On Bass\\" or simply ‚ÄúNJOB‚Äù, is an American bassist, songwriter, and producer.

Built for the male choral society of Strasbourg () in 1903, it has served as the principal concert hall of the city and home to the Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg until 1975. It has been classified as a Monument historique since 2007. Well known conductors such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Charles Munch, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Herbert von Karajan, Karel Anƒçerl, Pierre Boulez and Lorin Maazel, among others, have all conducted guest concerts in the Palais. History The concert hall in 1909 prior to the inauguration of the pipe organ The concert hall, looking in the opposite direction, circa 1905/1910 The Palais des F√™tes was built as the S√§ngerhaus (singer's house) between 1901 and 1903, when Strasbourg was a German city and the capital of Alsace-Lorraine. It was one of the first buildings in Strasbourg to make use of reinforced concrete. Although the architects Joseph M√ºller (1863‚Äì??) and (1852‚Äì1912) chose an Art Nouveau style for the building, the main auditorium ‚àí surface: [or according to other sources], height: , seating capacity: 1,300 ‚Äì was decorated in a lavish Neo-Baroque style. The building also included a restaurant large enough to accommodate up to 300 guests. The inauguration concert took place on 31 January 1903. In 1904, the premises were already considered too small and a new story was added on the current rue de Phalsbourg, including a rehearsal room now called Salle Balanchine. A pipe organ was installed in the main hall in 1909. A work by builders , it was designed, like several other pipe organs in Strasbourg (for instance the choir pipe organ of Saint-Thomas church), according to principles by Albert Schweitzer. Plans to further expand the size and capacity of the S√§ngerhaus by adding a new wing at the rear were set up shortly before World War I. Strasbourg was again a French city when work was finally conducted. Architect Paul Dopff (1885‚Äì1965) added a wing in a more severe style, closer to Beaux-Arts architecture, in 1921. That wing was centred around a great room for choir rehearsals called Salle de la Marseillaise. The inner decoration of the main auditorium was completely modified in 1933 according to principles of New Objectivity. The stucco and chandeliers were all removed, the organ case lost most of its ornaments. The other parts of the building mostly retained their Art Nouveau decoration and elements, including stained glass and door handles. During World War II, the basement of the Palais served as an air-raid shelter. Although Strasbourg was bombed several times in 1944, the Palais was not hit. Since the Orchestre philharmonique moved out of the Palais des F√™tes and into the Palais de la musique et des congr√®s in 1975, the 1903 venue has still served for concerts, but less frequently. It is still home to La Philharmonie, a medium-sized semi-professional orchestra founded in 1900 that performs three times a year, and occasionally hosts jazz, rock, gospel and other non-classical music genres. The Marseillaise wing is home to the municipal ballet school (). The S√§ngerhaus wing also regularly hosts conventions such as the anime convention ‚Ä≥Japan Addict\\". The Palais des F√™tes is undergoing restoration since 2011 and until 2021; the concert hall was expected to be ready in December 2019 and an inaugural symphonic concert was scheduled for 31 January 2020,, but on 24 January 2020, it was announced that the opening would be delayed until autumn of the same year. Restoration began with the Marseillaise wing, whose central courtyard was covered with a glass roof in order to create an atrium. Remains of the Neo-Baroque vault ornaments from 1903 were unexpectedly rediscovered in 2018. Layout The main entrance to the Palais is on rue Sell√©nick, a street created in 1888 (original name: Julianstra√üe). The entrance to the rear wing is on boulevard Cl√©menceau, a street created in 1881 (original name: Steinring). The whole complex takes up half of the square block delimited (clockwise) by boulevard Cl√©menceau, rue Specklin, rue Sell√©nick, and rue de Phalsbourg.

He is Founder and Chairman of Element Solutions Inc., Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of Nomad Foods Limited, and Co-Founder and Former Chairman of Jarden Corporation, which was sold to Newell Brands in 2016. Mr. Franklin is also the Founder and CEO of Mariposa Capital, a Miami based family investment firm, a Director of Restaurant Brands International Inc., Chairman and controlling shareholder of Royal Oak Enterprises, LLC, and is a principal and executive officer of several other private investment entities. Early life Martin Ellis Franklinhttps://antiguaobserver.com/investiture-ceremony-held-for-national- honorees/ was born on 31 October 1964 in London, England. His father, Sir Roland Franklin, was a merchant banker who undertook hostile takeovers with Sir James Goldsmith. Franklin emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of fifteen, settling in Harrison, New York. Franklin graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor of arts degree in political science. Business career After leaving college, Franklin worked for N M Rothschild & Sons in Manhattan, where he became the youngest Vice President in the US firm's history. As James Goldsmith began winding down his US operations in 1987, Martin joined his father in forming the Pembridge group. They undertook a series of transactions between 1987 and 1989, the largest of which was the $1.3 billion hostile takeover of Dickinson Robinson Group (DRG). At the age of twenty-four, Franklin was appointed as the chief executive officer of DRG, with the goal of breaking up the conglomerate via a series of asset sales. Roland Franklin retired from active business in 1991, leaving Martin and Ian Ashken to oversee the final DRG asset sales. In 1992 they returned to the US with the intention of using their experience at DRG to build, rather than break up companies. In October 1992, Franklin formed Benson Eyecare from the merger of shell public company Ehrlich Bober, an optical retail chain and Benson Optical, which was acquired from the pension fund of General Electric for US$2.3 million. Benson Eyecare relisted from the American Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, and Franklin served as its CEO. He was the youngest CEO of a corporation listed on the NYSE. Through a series of acquisitions and organic growth Benson Eyecare grew from $40 million in annualized revenue in 1992 to $150 million in 1996, when the company was sold to Essilor for US$300 million for a 23-fold return for early investors. Between 1996 and 2000, Franklin chaired and/or invested in companies such as Bolle, Lumen Technologies, Crunch Fitness and Corporate Express. Franklin and Ashken decided to try to move from the public company world where they had operated for the last ten years to the private company world and purchased 9.9% of Alltrista Corporation in January 2000 and made an offer to buy the whole company. When their bid failed, they became activist boards members in July 2001. In September 2001, Franklin became Alltrista's Chairman and CEO while Ashken became its Vice-Chairman and chief financial officer. Alltrista was renamed Jarden Corporation and Franklin served as its chairman and chief executive from 2001 to 2011, and as its executive chairman from 2011 to 2016 when James E Lillie became Jarden‚Äôs CEO. Under Franklin‚Äôs leadership, Jarden grew from approximately $300 million in revenues to more than $10 billion, having over 120 global brands and 35,000 employees before it was acquired by Newell Brands in April 2016. For the fifteen years Franklin was Chairman, Jarden generated over 5,000% stock returns to its investors with a compound return of over 30%. As executive chairman of Jarden, Franklin earned US$44 million in 2013. The following year, in 2014, he earned US$118 million, US$110.8 million of which was in shares, with a salary of US$2.2 million. He earned US$231 million in total from 2010 through 2014. Starting in 2006, Franklin founded a series of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, initially with Nicolas Berggruen, but also including William Ackman. The SPACS enabled companies such as GLG, Prisa, Phoenix Life, Burger King, and Macdermid Specialty chemicals to go public. Franklin co-founded Justice Holdings, a shell company on the London Stock Exchange which invested in Burger King. Franklin owned 2% in 2012. As of 2019, Franklin continues to serve on the Board of directors of Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King and Tim Hortons, and Element Solutions Inc.(formerly Platform Specialty Products).

His Riyaz√º'≈ü ≈ûuara tezkire (bibliographical dictionary of poets and poetry), is the seventh of its kind in Ottoman history and is of great importance. Riyazi is considered the last of a group of bibliographers who tried to cover the entire field of Ottoman poetry. Life Riyazi was born with the name Mehmet in Mecca in the Islamic year 980 which corresponds to 1572 or 1573. 1572 is mostly accepted as birth year. He was named after his grandfather, the great scholar Mehmet Efendi of Birgi (from Birgi) who died in 1573, and was the son of Mustafa of Birgi. His father was a Kadƒ± (judge) and gave Mehmet his early education. On his return to Istanbul, Mehmet joined the jurisprudence profession. He received madrasah education by M√ºeyyedzade Abd√ºlk√¢dir Efendi. He served as mullah in many towns including Istanbul, Jerusalem, Cairo, Aleppo, and many provinces in Anatolia. In 1626 he retired due to deafness and there was no work from him since then. Riyazi died on 7 May 1644 in Istanbul. Poetry Riyaz√º'≈ü ≈ûuara is the seventh in the line of great Ottoman tezkires. It covered a selection of poets based on \\"greatness\\" as adjudicated by the author supported with an independent judgment. Other bibliographers that followed him had various opinions on him. His character is described as marked by avarice and meanness; both it and Riyazi's poetry influenced a lot by his wife. Ziya Pasha describes him as \\"the white rose of the garden of speech and the champion in the field of art\\", and singles out his qasida for particular commendation. The tezkire was started in 1607.≈ûair Tezkireleri- 4. √únite √ñzeti (in Turkish) The first recension was done in 1609 (1018 A.H.). The second recension is believed to have finished in 1617, as it includes drastic changes in the biography of Sultan Ahmed I who died that year. Riyzi was influence by the other known poet Nef'i, but only in the particular attention that he bestowed over his verses, his work is not modeled after any previous poet school. Riyazi was of course a poet himself. He left a vast diwan of poetry. In addition, he has other works: the Sakiname, and a Turkish-Persian dictionary.

She was a field medic and a nurse. Ho Thi Que was famous for her bravery and courage, earning the nickname \\"Madame Death\\" from her Viet Cong adversaries. She was decorated for valour three times.Grant De Pauw, Linda (2014). Battle Cries and Lullabies: Women in War from Prehistory to the Present. University of Oklahoma Press, Amongst her fellow rangers she was known for her ferocity, but also for her compassion; she would physically attack any soldier she found looting after battle, but would also comfort and tend to wounded or dying soldiers, often risking her life to reach them on the battlefield. Sometimes she would shave her head to express her grief at the loss of her fellow rangers. She also showed deep compassion for the families of the dead men, fighting for them to receive the benefits due them or lending them money to enable them to become financially independent. She was a recognisable figure on the battlefield. The Chicago Tribune noted that \\"she fought beside the men with a pair of .45 automatics strapped to her hips and wearing a polished steel helmet emblazoned with a tiger's head.\\" The Tiger Lady was an inspirational figure, often at the front of the battle with the men, charging through paddy fields, spurring her fellow soldiers on to victory. Just a few months before her death she is said to have emerged from a fierce battle against a thousand-strong enemy without a scratch. Early life Ho Thi Que was the daughter of a farmer. In the First Indochina War she spied on the French for the Viet Minh until she saw that communists were taking control of the Viet Minh. During this period she met her husband, Nguyen Van Dan, who would later become commander of the 44th Rangers and whom she would follow into battle. They had six children. Death In early November 1965 Ho Thi Que was shot and killed by her husband during an argument. He claimed self defence, saying Ho Thi Que had attacked him with a knife in a fit of jealousy over his affair with another woman. The prosecutor in the case stated that Nguyen Van Dan had killed his wife as he blamed her for the decline of his career. Nguyen Van Dan served one year in prison for her murder.

She was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for her entire career. Aside from one accidental collision in 1871, her service was uneventful. The ship was reclassified as coast-defense ironclad in 1892 and often served as a training ship. There was an unsuccessful proposal to convert her into an aircraft carrier in 1910. Admiral Lazarev was stricken from the Navy List in 1907 and sold for scrap in 1912. She sank while under tow to Germany later that year. Design and description Right elevation and plan from Brassey's Naval Annual 1888 The Admiral Lazarev-class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessors, the , and had an overall length of , a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ships were designed to displace , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced . They were fitted with a plough-shaped ram. Their crew consisted of between 269‚Äì274 officers and crewmen. The Admiral Lazarev-class ships had a single two-cylinder horizontal direct-acting steam engine that drove a single propeller, using steam provided by four rectangular fire-tube boilers. The engine was designed to produce a total of which gave a lightly loaded Admiral Lazarev a speed of from when she ran her sea trials in October 1871. They had a range of about at a speed of and were fitted with a light fore-and-aft sailing rig to steady them and aid in maneuvering.McLaughlin, pp. 115‚Äì16, 122‚Äì23 =Armament= The monitors were originally designed to be armed with six 20-caliber Obukhov rifled muzzle- loading guns, a pair in each Coles-type turret. Around 1874‚Äì1875 the guns were replaced by three 17-caliber, 11-inch rifled guns, based on a Krupp design. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, a 9-inch mortar was fitted to attack the thin deck armor of enemy ships, but accuracy was poor and it was later removed, probably in the early 1880s. A more powerful, 22-caliber, 11-inch gun was installed aboard Admiral Lazarev and her sister ship during the 1880s.McLaughlin, pp. 118‚Äì19 Light guns for use against torpedo boats were added to the Admiral Lazarev class during the Russo-Turkish War when a pair of 4-pounder guns were mounted on the roofs of the fore and aft gun turrets and a , 4-barreled Engstrem quick-firing (QF) gun. By the early 1890s, Admiral Lazarevs light armament consisted of two Baranov QF guns, five QF Hotchkiss guns, replacing the 4-pounders, and a pair of QF Hotchkiss five-barreled revolving cannon. The monitors could also carry 12‚Äì15 mines intended to be used to create a secure anchorage.McLaughlin, pp. 119‚Äì20 =Armor= The hull of the Admiral Lazarev-class monitors was completely covered by wrought iron armor that was thick amidships and thinned to aft and forward of the main belt. The turrets had of armor, except around the gun ports, where it thickened to . The conning tower was thick and the deck armor was in two layers with a total thickness of 1 inch.McLaughlin, pp. 121‚Äì22 Construction and service Admiral Lazarev was named for Admiral Mikhail Lazarev,Silverstone, p. 371 who circumnavigated the globe, taking part in the discovery of Antarctica, and later became commander of the Black Sea Fleet. The monitor was ordered on 24 May 1865 from the Carr and MacPherson Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 29 May 1867. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 21 September and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep- draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1872 at the cost of 1,289,300 rubles.McLaughlin, pp. 113‚Äì14 The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion, but she was not fully equipped until around 1872. Admiral Lazarev was accidentally rammed by the monitor in Kronstadt harbor on 22 October 1871 and had a hole punched in her hull below the waterline by the latter's ram. A large amount of water flooded in and Admiral Lazarev took on an eight degree list as it leaked through the poorly sealed watertight bulkheads, but nearby ships were able to pump out the water before she capsized.McLaughlin, pp. 114, 124‚Äì25 The accident prompted an investigation that concluded that the quality control of the riveting and caulking of the watertight bulkheads needed to be improved and it recommended testing that by flooding the interior compartments during construction. That recommendation was not followed until after the loss of the in a similar incident in 1897. In the meantime Admiral Lazarev was fitted with an improved bilge system for evaluation, designed by Lieutenant Stepan Makarov, that connected all of the ship's pumps to the main bilge drain. This proved successful and it became a standard feature of later Russian ships.McLaughlin, p. 124 The ship had her boilers replaced in 1881‚Äì1882McLaughlin, p. 123 and again around 1900‚Äì1903, possibly with cylindrical boilers.Watts, p. 107 She was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and frequently served with the Artillery Training Detachment of the Baltic Fleet. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, Admiral Lazarev was deployed to Libava, Latvia, to reinforce the defenses there. The ship was stricken on 14 August 1907McLaughlin, p. 125 although one naval architect proposed a conversion into a flush-decked aircraft carrier in July 1910. The turrets and superstructure would be removed and replaced by a full-length flight deck, measuring , supported on stanchions above the original deck. The aircraft would be stowed below the flight deck and a small navigation bridge fitted there as well. The funnel would be split and redirected to exhaust on each side outboard of the flight deck. This may have been the first serious proposal by a designer for an aircraft carrier that utilized most of the features of modern carriers.McLaughlin, pp. 126‚Äì27 Although perfectly feasible given the low take-off and landing speeds of the aircraft of the day, the proposal was not accepted, possibly because it would have been relatively expensive at a time when the Naval Ministry was struggling to finance the dreadnought battleships and other modern ships.

It is dedicated to Saint George, and has Grade II* listed status. History There has been a church on the site, in Castle Way, since at least the fourteenth century; the church was first mentioned in 1293. The first known rector was Adam de Brome, founder of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1309. According to Daniel Lysons, vicar in 1800, the church was made of flint and stone, with a low wooden turret. As the church's living was in the hands of the lord of the manor, only the name of the rector was mentioned. The original church included stained glass windows of the coats of arms of the Crosby family, who owned the manor in 1471; the Killigrew family, who owned the manor in the latter part of the sixteenth century; and the Royal arms of 1625, incorporating the royal cypher JR. The latter window was moved to the rectory after the church's reconstruction in 1808, before moving to its present site in the V&A; in 1975. Monarchs and their consorts who are known to have worshipped here are King Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, Catherine Parr and Queen Elizabeth I. Baron Cottington of Hanworth took a further interest in Saint George's church. He had his son Charles baptised here on 21 July 1628 in the presence of King Charles I, the Duke of Buckingham and Mary Feilding, wife of the Marquess of Hamilton. Cottington also gave the church a silver chalice and paten, which are still used today. In 1807, it was decided that the entire church should be dismantled and rebuilt. The building of the new church was done by James Wyatt, a notable architect of the time. Wyatt only just lived to see it completed in 1812, as he was killed in a carriage accident the following year. His family are buried in the churchyard, but Wyatt himself lies in Westminster Abbey. Saint George's assumed its current form in 1865, when a local architect, Algernon Perkins, volunteered to redesign the church at his own expense. The spire, added at about this time, was designed by S S Teulon. The lychgate, which forms the main entrance to the church, was built in 1882. It is said to be a copy of the one in Beddington, South London, and was done in memory of the mother-in-law of John Lyndhurst Winslow, rector at the time. Two of the owners of Hanworth Manor, Thomas Chamber and Aubrey Vere, are buried in the church. The former has a memorial tablet, which is now in the north transept, while the latter has a gravestone on the church floor. Present day St George‚Äôs Church, Hanworth is currently in Interregnum. From 1992 until early 2019, Paul Williamson was priest in charge of St George's Church, Hanworth. Though Fr Paul is currently challenging both the Church of England‚Äôs set retirement age of 70 on grounds of age discrimination, and the Bishop of London‚Äôs denial to extend his current Priest-in-Charge license by five years. St George's is a parish in the Anglo-Catholic tradition. It is a Forward in Faith parish. As it rejects the ordination of women, the church receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker).

He was also a court painter and did several portraits of Wilhelmina, as Princess and Queen.  Biography  His father was sexton at Der Aa-kerk. He showed an early aptitude for art and, against the wishes of his parents, enrolled at the Academie Minerva in 1860, where he studied with J.H. Egenberger.Brief biography @ Kunstbus.After graduating, he spent another year at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp). Later, he took private lessons in the studios of Lawrence Alma-Tadema.Brief biography by Martin Mulder @ Dodenakkers. After a brief stay in Paris, he returned to Groningen and worked as a teacher at the Academie from 1867 to 1874. He moved to Brussels that year to establish himself as a painter but, for unknown reasons, relocated to The Hague in 1875, where he lived until 1902. It was during this time that he served as a court painter and many of his works are still to be seen in Het Loo. In 1898, an illustrated album called Horse Races was published, containing 40 lithographs of Eerelman's paintings by Richard Schoenbeck (1840-1919). It featured Queen Wilhelmina's favorite horse, \\"Woyko\\", and proved to be very popular. Later, an annotated collection of his works was translated into English by Clara Bell under the title Horses and Dogs. His best known painting, \\"De paardenkeuring op de Grote Markt op de 28ste augustus\\", depicts an annual celebration (featuring horses) held to commemorate the lifting of the Siege of Groningen. For health reasons (\\"rheumatic neuralgia\\"), he spent five years in Arnhem, then went back to Groningen in 1907. At the age of eighty, he was made a Ridder and a street in Groningen was named after him. It was said that one could tell when visitors to the Louvre were from Groningen because they would ask \\"where are the Eerelmans?\\". He was, however, mostly forgotten by the second half of the 20th century. It is only recently that interest in his works has been revived.

Examples of snowmen built included a snownun that was seducing a man, a snowman and a snowwoman having sex in front of the town fountain and a naked snowboy urinating into the mouth of a drunken snowman. There were also snow unicorns, snow mermaids, a snow dentist, and snow prostitutes enticing people into the city's red light district. Among the political snowmen created were \\"a snow virgin with a unicorn in her lap\\", that was built in front of the ducal palace in Coudenberg, the home of Holy Roman Emperor This was in protest to him being absent and instead living with his aunt Margaret of Austria in Malines. Before the Miracle, there had been six weeks of cold weather. Combined with mass population growth and a large wealth discrepancy between the peasants and the ruling House of Habsburg, the locals decided to use the snowmen as a form of protest. The different socioeconomic classes each constructed different kinds of snowman. As a result, the poor would destroy snowmen built by the ruling classes. Eventually, the Miracle concluded when the snow thawed during the warm following spring, which led to flooding in Brussels.

A granddaughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, the princess had the ch√¢teau rebuilt to designs of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. The princess is most notable as the woman who officially presented Madame de Pompadour to the court of King Louis XV at Versailles, in return for settlement of her debts by the king. Circa 1820, a new owner, the Comte de Turtot Hocquart, finding the ch√¢teau old fashioned, had it remodelled. In 1857, the estate was sold again, and purchased by Charles Tavernier, who built the lodge and redesigned and landscaped the grounds. In 1874, Tavernier gave the chateau to the banker Julius Beer, who gave it to his son William. William's wife Elena created a notable literary salon there.Topic Topos retrieved 31 October 2015. It was at the chateau that Leconte de Lisle wrote his work La Rose de Louveciennes.Topic Topos retrieved 31 October 2015. The poet died while staying at the chateau's classical garden pavilion in 1894. The mansion is designed on an \\"H\\" plan, with the two extending wings joined by an open loggia on the southern entrance facade, and on the northern garden facade by an orangery. On the eastern side is low, unobtrusive wing containing the kitchens and domestic offices. The main block is of three floors, with five principal rooms on the ground floor. The low hipped roof is concealed by a closed parapet. Following William's death in 1913, his widow retained use of the garden pavilion, but the estate passed to a relative, the banker and collector Robert de Rothschild (1880‚Äì1946). On his death, the estate was sold. Since 1946, the estate has remained the property of BNP Paribas, a company which oppeates the house as a training center.Campus BNP Baribas, sur le site campus-louveciennes.bnpparibas.com. The ch√¢teau has been registered as an historic monument since 10 February 1948.

The song was an immensely successful regional hit in Texas, precipitating \\"Bad Girl\\"'s national release on Mercury Records later in the year. Since its initial distribution, the tune has received further recognition for its appearance on several compilation albums. Background Forming in early 1966, the Zakary Thaks rose to prominence in Corpus Christi, Texas, becoming a popular fixture, and rival to fellow group the Bad Seeds, while performing in the music venue known as the Carousel Club. The band members collectively adopted their moniker for sounding distinctively British, thereby symbolizing the group's alignment with the British Invasion, particularly the Kinks, the Yardbirds, and the Rolling Stones. The Zakary Thaks' R&B-influenced; musical stance and assortment of original material appealed to record producer and Bad Seeds manager Carl Becker, who signed the band to his record label J-Beck. Entering Jimmy Nicholls‚Äô (who owned the local Pharaoh Records label, releasing material by several other Texas musical acts) studio in McAllen, Texas along with the Bad Seeds, the Zakary Thaks recorded \\"Bad Girl\\", for all intents and purposes as a live number on a basic two-track tape. All five members collaborated to pen the song, which was coupled with their compelling cover version of the Kinks' \\"I Need You\\". For lead vocalist Chris Gerniottis, \\"Bad Girl\\" was \\"like the one true picture of what the Zakary Thaks were as a group\\". Indeed, the composition reflects upon the group's adolescent sound inspired by early-Kinks music, though Gerniottis's bluesy vocals are remarkably mature given that he was only 15-years-old at the time of the song's recording. Musically, \\"Bad Girl\\" is also highlighted by Stan Moore's frantic drumming, and lead guitarist John Lopez's double-time guitar break, assembling one of the best examples of the musical genre of garage rock. Upon release, \\"Bad Girl\\" propelled to number one regionally in Texas. The success of the single prompted Mercury Records to national distribute the song in October 1966. It began a string of high- quality singles, including the follow-up \\"Face to Face\\", that were immensely popular in Texas, but unheralded throughout the rest of the United States. In 1979, \\"Bad Girl\\" was finally recognized as a quintessential garage rock composition as a result of its inclusion on Pebbles, Volume 2. Other compilation albums that the song appears on includes J-Beck Story, Volume 2 and the 1998 expanded box-set of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965‚Äì1968, along with the Zakary Thaks compilations Texas Band, Face to Face, Passage to India, Form the Habit, and It's the End: The Definitive Collection.

It was progressively demolished from the late 18th century until the 1960s. The very fine oriel window from the building has been preserved in the gatehouse of Lincoln Castle. History The palace was initially built by a member of the wealthy Sutton family of Lincoln merchants in the latter years of the 14th. century, on land immediately to the north of St Andrews church. Research into the history of the building by Sir Francis Hill greatly clarified its early ownership.Hill, J.W.F., (1948), Medieval Lincoln, pp163, 167, & 168 More recently the study of early drawings and maps by David Stocker has made it possible to reconstruct the layout of the building.Stocker, D.A., 1999, A Very Goodly House Longging to Sutton‚Ä¶A Reconstruction of 'John of Gaunt's Palace', Lincoln Lincolnshire History and Archaeology, Vol 34, pp 5-15 Stocker suggested The building was probably built by John of Gaunt's vassal John de Sutton, a wealthy merchant and mayor of Lincoln in 1386. However S.H. Rigby \\"Rigby\\" (2000), 35-45 has made out a case that the palaces was originally built by Robert Sutton the brother of John, also a mayor of Lincoln and vassal of Gaunt, who is known to have built a house on the land to the north of St Andrew's Church before 1386. File:John of Gaunt's Palace, Lincoln.pngJohn of Gaunt's Palace, Lincoln 1726 File:Lincoln, part of the old house near St Peter at Gowts by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm 1784.jpgSouthern portion of John of Gaunt's Palace by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm 1784 =Architectural History= The house was probably constructed in the late 14th century, and its form represents a wealthy merchant's town house with a hall and services parallel to the High Street, and an east-west range to the rear of the street front range which contained the great hall and privy chambers. There was also a possible lodgings block to the north of the main street front range, which had the arms of John of Gaunt along with other heraldic shields shown above the doors. This lodging block may have accommodated John of Gaunt during his visit to Lincoln in 1386. The Old Hospital, Lincoln, at the back of John of Gaunt's Palace A drawing by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm shows a building described as the Old Hospital abutting on to the hall range with its two fine late medieval windows. These buildings were on the west side behind the High Street frontage of the palace. The Hospital building should date from around 1500 and the lozenge shaped terminals to the doorway and the sunken panels to the spandrels find a very close parallel with the Chancery, in Minster Yard, Lincoln.\\"Stocker\\"(1999) pg11. This is probably the building that Edward James Willson mentions as having been demolished around 1810 and it is not shown on J. S. Padley's survey of Lincoln in 1842.\\"Stocker\\"(1999) pg.9 John of Gaunts palace was substantially re-built in 1849, becoming an ‚Äòordinary-looking stone-built property‚Äô which survived until the 1960s, when it was demolished to make way for a garage extension. One of the hall windows, recorded by Edward James Willson did survive into the 1940s. A series of stone foundations and walls aligned east-west and north-south were recorded in February 2008, during trial trenching at 116 High Street, Lincoln. It is likely that these relate to John of Gaunt's Palace.The earliest phase of wall construction may represent an earlier building demolished to make way for the merchant's house in the later 14th century. Pottery of 13th-15th century date was recovered.John of Gaunt‚Äôs Palace =Colonel Bromhead's House= Colonel Bromhead's House, High Street, Lincoln c 1784 Grimm also records another building just to the north of the palace which he describes as Colonel Bromhead's House. This fronts onto the High Street. This is an interesting example of the Lincolnshire Artisan Mannerist style of house building of the mid-17th century. It was built of brick for Alderman Original Peart in 1646, and was one of the earliest examples of brick building in Lincoln. It passed from him to the Bromhead family.Hill F., (1956), Tudor and Stuart Lincoln, pg 211 =Andrews Church, St Andrews Hall and St Andrews Cottages= To the south of John of Gaunt's Palace was St Andrew's Church, and to the south of this, over the entrance to Gaunt Street and on the site of the former Lincoln Arms stood a Norman house known as the St Andrew's Hall. Just before its demolition in 1783 it was recorded by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm. His drawing shows that it was very similar to the Jew's House and the Norman House on the Straight and Steep Hill in Lincoln. His drawing also shows that St Andrew's Hall was immediately adjacent to St Andrew's Cottages which are a row shops that are still standing.Anon.

It was released for Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita in June 2016, by Spike Chunsoft in Japan and Aksys Games in North America and Europe. A Microsoft Windows version was released worldwide by Spike Chunsoft in June 2016. A PlayStation 4 version was also released in North America and Japan in August 2017, and in Europe in September 2017. The game is the third entry in the Zero Escape series, following Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors (2009) and Virtue's Last Reward (2012). The story is set between the previous two games, and follows nine people who are kidnapped by a masked person known as Zero. They are divided into three teams, and forced to play a death game called the \\"Decision Game\\". The player takes the roles of three of the characters, and plays through the chapters the story is made up of: these consist of animated cinematics, escape-the-room puzzles, and moral decisions for the player to make. The chapters represent 90-minute periods, and can be played out of order. The game was directed and written by series creator Kotaro Uchikoshi, and features music by Shinji Hosoe and character designs by Rui Tomono. Uchikoshi had started planning the game's story in 2012, but its development was put on indefinite hiatus due to the commercial failure of the series in Japan. Development was later announced in 2015 to have resumed in response to high demand from the series' fan base. The game was positively received by critics.

Zero Time Dilemma is an adventure game consisting of multiple chapters, representing 90-minute periods; chapters consist of narrative sections and escape-the-room puzzle sections. The chapters, referred to as \\"fragments\\", are chosen through the Floating Fragment system, in which the player gets to choose a fragment to play based on an image and a vague description. The fragments can be played out of order; the characters lose their memory after each 90-minute period, and do not know where they are in the timeline. When the player completes a fragment, they are returned to the Floating Fragment screen, and the completed fragment is placed in a narrative flowchart, indicating where it takes place in the story. Narrative sections are presented as three-dimensional animated cinematics, with camera movements and full voice acting in Japanese and English. The Escape sections, which include thirteen different rooms, involve the player searching the room for tools and clues through a point-and-click interface in a first-person perspective and solving puzzles. The puzzles are mostly self-contained, and test the player's problem-solving skills and memory; among these are puzzles where the player has to decipher messages, and ones where they have to align the sides of a three-dimensional object correctly. After completing an Escape section, the player needs to take a stance in a moral decision; one such decision involves one character being locked into a chair with a gun next to it and another character inside an incinerator. To stop the incinerator, the player needs to choose to pull the trigger, which has a 50% possibility of firing a live bullet, killing the character in the chair. The way the decisions are made varies: some involve choosing between options, and some have the player input their own answer.  Plot  = Setting and characters = Zero Time Dilemma is set between the events of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward. The game follows nine characters who have been locked up in an underground nuclear bomb shelter and are forced to play a death game called the Decision Game, which is led by a masked person known as Zero. The shelter is divided into three wards, with three people placed in each section, making up three teams: C-Team, Q-Team, and D-Team. To get to the central elevator hall and escape, the characters need six passwords; one password is revealed each time one of them dies. The characters are all wearing watches that inject them with a drug every 90 minutes, inducing memory loss. Heavily involved in the game's lore is the many-worlds theory, where every decision made creates alternate universes where the opposite was chosen; these timelines make up the game's multiple routes. C-Team includes Carlos, a firefighter with a strong sense of justice; Akane, a member of a secret society working for a peaceful future, and who pretends to be a \\"neat and clean, ideal Japanese woman\\"; and Junpei, a childhood friend of Akane's, who has joined a detective agency to find her after she has not been heard from. Q-Team includes a naive amnesiac boy wearing a spherical helmet; Eric, an ice cream shop clerk who easily cracks under pressure; and Mira, who does not show much emotion and is in a relationship with Eric. D-Team includes Diana, a pacifist nurse who dislikes fighting; Phi, an intelligent woman who participated in the Dcom (Dwelling for Experimental Cohabitation of Mars) experiment together with Akane and Sigma to save the world from the Radical-6 virus; and Sigma, a 67-year-old man in the body of a 22-year-old. Additionally, there is a dog named Gab who is able to pass through vents between the sections to deliver messages between the teams. =Synopsis= The nine participants of the Dcom experiment are kidnapped by a masked individual known as Zero, who makes them play a coin toss; if they win, they are set free with no memory of what happened, and if they lose they awake in a facility separated into three wards, with one team in each. After losing, they are forced to play the \\"Decision Game\\", and submit a vote for one of the teams; the one with the most votes gets executed. At this point, the story starts branching into different timelines depending on player choices. In one timeline, Phi is killed, and Diana and Sigma are trapped in the facility. They discover a transporter device, which they use to send copies of themselves to another timeline; their original selves remain, however, and the transporter takes ten months to recharge. They begin a relationship, and Diana later gives birth to fraternal twins, a boy and a girl whom they name Delta and Phi. Using the recharged transporter, they send the babies to the past, to keep them safe from Zero. In another timeline, Akane realizes that Carlos can send his consciousness between timelines in times of danger, which she calls \\"Spacetime Human Internal Fluctuating Transfer\\", or \\"shifting\\". Through the resonance from Carlos's ability, C-Team shifts between timelines to collect passwords, but Zero sends the boy in the helmet ‚Äì revealed to be a humanoid robot named Sean ‚Äì to attack them for violating the rules. Carlos flees by shifting to the timeline that the copies of Diana and Sigma had been transported to. Diana and Sigma reach a room with sleeping pods, where they find and wake up Eric and Sean, and find the dead bodies of the remaining participants. Armed with a shotgun, Eric demands to know who killed Mira; Carlos says that he must be innocent as he was in the C Ward, but Diana realizes that the wards are not separate: there is only one lounge, which changes its appearance using projection mapping. They realize that only one team is active at a time, while the rest are kept asleep in the pods. Sean reveals Zero's true identity: he is Delta, an elderly man thought to be wheelchair-bound, deaf, blind and mute, who had been with Q-Team the entire time, but off-camera from the player's perspective. He admits that he killed Mira, and prevents the participants from escaping by using his esper abilities to make Eric shoot everyone but Diana. In the timeline leading to the events of Virtue's Last Reward, Phi is infected with Radical-6, which has a 75% possibility of causing suicidal intention. Junpei and Akane learn that Zero caused a Radical-6 outbreak in the hopes that it would kill a religious fanatic who would cause the complete extinction of humanity; Radical-6 was seen as the lesser evil, as it would allow two billion people to survive. In the timeline where no teams were executed, the participants who are able to shift recall their memories from previous timelines. Delta says that he ran the Decision Game to ensure his and Phi's birth, and to cause epigenetic changes in Diana and Sigma, giving Phi the ability to shift and Delta the ability to read minds and briefly control others' bodies. The participants activate the \\"force quit box\\" in the lounge, starting the facility's self-destruct sequence. Akane realizes that the impending danger and the resonance of the gathered shifters would allow the participants to shift to the timeline where they won the coin toss and were freed. After shifting, they threaten to call the police on Delta, but he points out that he has not committed any crimes in the current timeline. He says that there will be no Radical-6 outbreak in this timeline, meaning that mankind will go extinct, but that the participants now are determined to change the future; he says that one of his goals was to get them into this frame of mind. He gives Carlos a handgun with the choice of killing Delta or letting him live, saying that the fate of humanity is on the line. The game ends with Carlos aiming the gun. The post-game epilogues reveal that in this final timeline, Carlos' sister recovers from an illness and also gains the ability to jump between timelines. Carlos has become a brother figure to Akane and Junpei, who are to be married, and the three of them vow to stop the religious extremist. Mira has turned herself in for her killings and married Eric, but Sean breaks her out of prison so that they can use the transporter to stop Mira from committing her murders in the past. It is revealed that the 1904 version of Phi is speculated to have become a researcher who studied the transporter well into her 100s.  Development  alt=A 2016 photograph of Kotaro Uchikoshi. Zero Time Dilemma was developed by Chime, and directed and written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, with music composed by Shinji Hosoe. Uchikoshi first mentioned details of a third Zero Escape game in 2012, stating that it would be the last entry in the series. In June 2013, he said that he had finished planning the story, but that development had not yet begun. In February 2014, it was announced that the project was put on hold indefinitely in response to the series' poor commercial reception in Japan. Uchikoshi examined the possibility of financing the development through the use of crowdfunding on a website like Kickstarter, but felt that the idea would not be persuasive enough for it to meet the goal; he also sought out opportunities with executives and investors. The series' fandom created Operation Bluebird, an online campaign to raise awareness of the series and support the game's development, in response to its hiatus. When delivering the pitch for the game, Uchikoshi opened with a fan-made vocal rendition of the series theme song, \\"Morphogenetic Sorrow\\"; he considered this a major point in getting the project approved. At the 2015 Anime Expo in July, Aksys Games announced that development of the third game had been resumed, citing the high demand and awareness for the game as key factors for its reevaluation. By March 2016, development was 80% finished. The porting of the game to Microsoft Windows was handled by Chime, with consultation from Abstraction Games, who had previously worked on Microsoft Windows ports for the Danganronpa series. For the music, Uchikoshi wrote down directions about the mood and concept of the game, describing it as \\"sad and lonely, like a worn-out record\\", and \\"dark and visceral\\". Hosoe described the music as generally less melodic: because they could not make the music hit on cue like in film, they decided during the planning stage to include silence in the soundtrack, so Hosoe created atmospheric tracks to be used as background noise. Because the Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors characters Junpei and Akane and the Virtue's Last Reward characters Sigma and Phi appear in the game, Uchikoshi decided to have arrangements of songs from those two games included in the soundtrack. He also had the songs \\"Digital Root\\" and \\"Trepidation\\", which had been used in both previous games, be included, as he saw them as a sort of theme songs that tie the games together as a series, similarly to \\"The Imperial March\\" from the Star Wars films. Hosoe received a list of what songs were to be rearranged and how they were to be used within the game, and was asked to compose a total of 45 songs; he did however end up composing nearly 70 songs, ensuring that they had something that fit every situation in the game. For the ending theme, Hosoe incorporated several callbacks to songs from the previous games as \\"a sendoff for the series\\", leading into \\"Morphogenetic Sorrow\\". Two puzzle creators were enlisted with designing the escape-the-room scenarios; Uchikoshi described one of them as creating \\"orthodox\\" puzzles, and the other, Strider creator Kouichi Yotsui, as creating \\"unique and out-of-the-box\\" types of puzzles. He gave them a rough idea of what he wanted each puzzle to convey and how he wanted them to resolve. The puzzle designers would come up with a draft, which he would finalize together with them. = Story and themes = The game was originally planned to be developed simultaneously with the previous Zero Escape game, Virtue's Last Reward, with the two games being \\"paired as a set\\", and with Virtue's Last Reward having a cliffhanger ending. With Zero Time Dilemma, Uchikoshi intended to resolve all mysteries left from the previous game, as well as all introduced in the third, while also attempting to make the story enjoyable for first-time players. This was used as a \\"basic framework\\" to write the story within. In addition to figuring out how to explain the mysteries while avoiding contradictions with Virtue's Last Reward, they added side stories to the narrative to give it \\"a little extra punch\\". They also took the time-travel ability some characters in Virtue's Last Reward have into consideration, as it opened up for more narrative possibilities. Uchikoshi worked with two other writers; the three helped each other come up with ideas and figure out the best ways to make the story work. When coming up with the story, he knew from the start that he wanted Sigma, Phi and Diana to be on one team, and Akane on another; this left open slots in the teams, which were filled with other characters as story development progressed. The script took one year to write. While Uchikoshi had already had an idea for the setting and events of Zero Time Dilemma when writing Virtue's Last Reward, the game structure changed when the time came to implement it. One reason was that characters \\"take on a life of their own and make their own decisions\\" when he writes from their point of view, and that characters might pull the story in a different direction than he had originally planned; most of the time, he would let the story go where the characters want to go rather than forcing it to follow his original plans, leading to changes in story and structure. The budget partly dictated the game's setting in an enclosed space as it required few art assets to develop. The game's main theme is morality, and it is the game in the series with the largest focus on philosophy; Uchikoshi intends to have the player's \\"way of thinking, values, [and] virtues\\" shaken intensely while they play the game. The \\"dilemma\\" in the game's title reflects this, as the game asks the player whether choices they make are the right thing to do. Another main theme is identity, and how people try to figure out who they are. This came from Uchikoshi's personal struggles with identity issues: he said that he is \\"always thinking about who [he is]\\" and that he thinks he might have a multifaceted personality; his characters, like him, deal with this issue. Among other major themes are \\"multiple- probability histories\\", with the player being able to move between different equally probable histories depending on the choices they have made; and the big effects small coincidences can have, which was reflected in the use of randomizing events. The idea to include randomization came from how Uchikoshi wanted to \\"spoiler-proof\\" the game, and felt that FAQ websites that tell players how to beat the game make playthroughs uninteresting. He had always been fascinated by the concept of coincidences, and how actions done in the past lead up \\"where we are today\\", so he did a lot of research and reading on the topic to prepare writing the story. The theme of no absolute good or evil came from Buddhist literature Uchikoshi had read, particularly the Zen Buddhist idea of \\"shiki soku zeku\\", which he described as \\"matter is void and form is emptiness\\". Because of this idea, Uchikoshi tried to give each character \\"their own sense of personal justice that they believe to be true\\", resulting in characters with different philosophies who play off each other. While previous Zero Escape titles tell their narratives through visual novel segments, Zero Time Dilemma replaces them with cinema scenes, intended to feel familiar for Western players and \\"emulate the feel of a big-budget American TV show\\". To further this effect, the option to turn off the subtitles was included. Due to this more cinematic approach, Uchikoshi was able to make use of his experience with writing the anime series Punch Line (2015). The inspirations for the change in format were Telltale Games' adventure game series The Walking Dead (2012‚Äì2019) and Level-5's adventure game Time Travelers (2012). Uchikoshi said that this would make for a lower barrier of entry for people not necessarily interested in visual novels, and that mass appeal is important to Spike Chunsoft, as just a Japanese audience is not enough for the production of adventure games. The non-linear and episodic nature of the game's chapters was done to appeal to more casual players and people new to the series, as they can uncover the story at their own pace without being \\"railroaded into doing one storyline from start to finish\\". The use of fragments added some challenge to writing the story: Uchikoshi had to be careful when planning the progression of the story, as changes to one fragment would also affect the fragments surrounding it. When breaking the story up into fragments, he considered what would be the most entertaining for players. In response to feedback from players, Zero Time Dilemma was intended to be more suspenseful than Virtue's Last Reward: Uchikoshi and the game's producer decided that, as Zero Time Dilemma is the final Zero Escape game, they should no longer hold back and instead do what they had always wanted to do. Because of the life-and-death theme, they felt that there would be less of an impact if they had held back, and that they instead should make the violence in the game \\"extreme\\" to make the player's choices hit home. According to Uchikoshi, the development team wanted the player to feel worried, and that the game would be done as he wants it without any changes done for the sake of age ratings: they had originally considered aiming for a CERO D age rating ‚Äì 17 years or older ‚Äì but decided to aim for a Z age rating instead, which is the highest age rating in Japan, as they felt they could not get the visual and emotional impact they wanted within a D rating. Despite this, CERO ended up assigning the game a D rating. =Character design= The game's characters were designed by Rui Tomono; Uchikoshi had considered asking Kinu Nishimura, the character designer for the previous two games in the series, to return, but wanted to show that the series had changed significantly. He also felt that, as the production had moved from backgrounds and drawn characters to 3D cinematics, \\"more impressive design\\" was needed, and that Tomono's designs were likely to be accepted internationally while still feeling Japanese. Some character designs had to be changed due to technical difficulties with the 3D models: the baggy sleeves of Akane's dress were made tighter; Junpei's jacket was removed; and asymmetrical aspects of Eric's design were removed. Zero's character design was changed to suit the story's focus on a virus; the character wears a plague doctor mask as opposed to the gas mask worn in the previous games. Carlos was designed to clearly communicate his occupation as a firefighter: he was given scars on his arms, a tight t-shirt and shirt to help show off his muscular build and silhouette, and an axe embroidery on his shirt pocket. Because Akane is Japanese, her design incorporated Japanese elements such as the use of straight lines on her top and a belt to emulate the look of a kimono and a kimono sash. The black color of the belt was meant to represent her hidden dark side, while the belt chains represented things that constrict her. The top halves of her sleeves were initially going to be pastel purple to make sure that the design was not too dark and that it contrasted against Junpei's more monochromatic design; this was changed for the final model, however, with Tomono noting that the use of purple might be better for a mentally unstable character. Similarly, Akane was given blue accents to contrast against Junpei's reds. Junpei was redesigned to fit his jaded personality in Zero Time Dilemma as his previous design in Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors felt \\"childish\\" and clashing. His design process was difficult, with the development team going through many design proposals. Sean was originally meant to wear a cubic helmet, but Tomono presented a spherical design instead, which Uchikoshi described as \\"everything I didn't know I wanted\\". Mira was designed to continue the series tradition of having a \\"sexy femme fatale\\" character in each game: she was given an open track jacket and a bikini-like top to show off her cleavage, and a jiggle effect was added to her 3D model. Eric's design and 3D modelling went smoothly, with Chime saying that some faces are easier to model than others. Tomono wanted him to specifically have a Caucasian chin and brow, but noted that they had to be careful to not go too far with it, to avoid a too realistic look. Diana's design was difficult to recreate in 3D, with the initial model having \\"really chubby chipmunk cheeks\\", but was worked on until it matched the design. She was also difficult to animate, due to her long skirt. Phi was originally shorter and had bigger eyes, but after she was given glasses, it was decided that she should look more like a model to match the stylish look of her short hair and glasses. Parts of Sigma's design from Virtue's Last Reward were incorporated into his new one, in the form of embroidery on his polo shirt.  Promotion and release  In March 2015, Aksys Games launched the website 4infinity.co, which consisted of a countdown timer; the countdown ended in July, coinciding with the game's announcement at Anime Expo. The game's title and logo were revealed in October, and in December, a teaser Twitter account was launched, revealing artwork of characters from the game. The game was unveiled during a presentation in March 2016. The Japanese release uses the English series title, Zero Escape, instead of the title used for previous Japanese releases, as the developers wanted to renew the series' image and bring over the Western title to Japan. Unlike previous Zero Escape games, the game was localized alongside the production of the Japanese version: it was published by Aksys Games for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita in North America and Europe on June 28, 2016, with a Japanese release following on June 30. A Microsoft Windows version was released worldwide by Spike Chunsoft on June 30, 2016. The game was released digitally and physically on the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita in North America, and digitally only in Europe. The PlayStation Vita version is compatible with the PlayStation TV. The Nintendo 3DS version does not support the system's stereoscopic 3D effect. A PlayStation 4 version with improved lighting and shading was released in Japan on August 17, 2017 and in North America one day later, and by Rising Star Games in Europe on September 8, 2017. In North America, a limited edition that includes a wristwatch was released. Because the watches were damaged in transit, they were delayed and sent separately from the game. Japanese pre-ordered copies came bundled with the 48-page Zero Escape: Premium Booklet, which includes production material, illustrations by Tomono, summaries of the previous two Zero Escape games, and a prequel written by Uchikoshi; a digital edition of the booklet was bundled with the Microsoft Windows release, together with a portion of the game's soundtrack. Aksys plans to release the booklet separately from the game, and is also considering releasing other merchandise based on the game. According to Hosoe, his company, Supersweep, which published the soundtrack albums for the previous games, is considering publishing an album for Zero Time Dilemma too.  Reception  Zero Time Dilemma was well received by critics on all platforms, and was the second-best reviewed PlayStation Vita game of 2016 on Metacritic, after Steins;Gate 0. During its opening week in Japan, it sold 5,375 copies on the PlayStation Vita and 3,916 copies on the Nintendo 3DS, for a total of 9,291 copies sold. It was the third best selling digital PlayStation Vita game of June 2016 in Europe, despite being released three days before the end of the month. The Steam release had an estimated total of 38,000 players by July 2018. Complete list. Famitsu four reviewers enjoyed the game's setup of three different teams and non-chronological plot progression, with the player getting a greater understanding of the story as they play; one of them said that learning what was going on in the fragments was \\"fantastic\\", and that they liked the emphasis on \\"interpersonal human drama\\". Another of them commented that the \\"light banter\\" dialogue is helpful in motivating the player. One of them said that the game would be enjoyable even for players who have not played previous entries in the series. The reviewers at Famitsu noted that the puzzle rooms were challenging and fun, but wished that the game had included a hint function for people who primarily play the game for the story; one of the reviewers also commented that the way the player uses items is difficult at some points. They appreciated how the puzzle rooms, unlike many other escape-the-room games, do not feel artificial. IGN praised the \\"inventive\\" puzzles, \\"stellar\\" storytelling, darker tone, decisions and consequences, \\"beautiful character moments,\\" and \\"mind-bending plot.\\" Metro praised the \\"excellent script\\" and said it is \\"one of the best narrative- driven video games\\" they've \\"ever played,\\" and \\"a milestone in video game storytelling, pushing it forwards in terms of thematic complexity and decision-making\\". Destructoid called the game a \\"hallmark of excellence\\" ruined only by the \\"abysmal presentation\\" of the cut scenes. One reviewer at Famitsu liked how the game allows the player to skip past already viewed cutscenes, while another commented that the cutscenes are not perfectly lip- synched to the Japanese voice acting. Metro said the \\"voice-acting can be of variable quality and the animation is very low tech.\\" The game has won or been nominated for some awards: it won Destructoid's award for the best PlayStation Vita game of 2016, Game Informer award for the best ending in an adventure game of 2016, and RPGFan's Reader's Choice award in the adventure games and visual novels category. It was a runner-up for Hardcore Gamer Best Story, Best Voice Acting and Best PlayStation Vita Game of 2016 awards, and was nominated for IGN's Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita games of the year awards. It was selected for two of RPGFan's Editors' Awards: Peter Triezenberg ranked it as the fifth best game of the year, while Robert Fenner selected it for his Most Disappointing category; and Mira was included on Destructoid's list of their favorite new video game characters of 2016.

As governor of Stettin in 1806, he surrendered without a fight, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Prussian military tribunal. Life From a Westphalian noble family, Romberg was born in his family castle in 1729. He started his career in the Prussian army by becoming a Gefreitenkorporal in Infanterieregiment Graf Wied (No. 41) in 1746. He was badly wounded at the battle of Cologne in 1757. In 1773 he was put in command of a grenadier battalion and the following year he was made a member of the Pour le M√©rite Order. In 1780 he was put in command of Infanterieregiment von Wolffersdorff (No. 9) under Karl Friedrich von Wolffersdorff - in the same year he was made an oberst. In 1787 he became a major general and the following year he was put in command of Infanterieregiment No. 10. In 1792 he was made a member of the Order of the Red Eagle. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1794 and made governor of Stettin in 1799. This was the capital of the Prussian province of Pomerania and intended as a position where Romberg would see little or no fighting. However, in 1806 the War of the Fourth Coalition broke out and on 14 October that year the Prussian Army was crushed by the French at the Battle of Jena. On 28 October the garrison of Prenzlau (a town to the southwest of Stettin) under Prince Hohenloe surrendered almost without a fight. French troops then arrived at Stettin and demanded its surrender and Romberg and his two subordinates (major general Kurd Gottlob von Knobelsdorff and major general Bonaventura von Rauch, commanders of the fortress and Fort Preusse respectively) decided to do so without a fight, thinking the French force was far larger than it was - it in fact consisted of only two hussar regiments under Antoine Lasalle, who accepted the surrender on 30 October. A Prussian military tribunal sentenced Romberg to life imprisonment for the surrender but ill health meant he was unable to take up his sentence and he died less than three years later in Berlin.

Built in 1901 as the restaurant Rigiblick, the theater houses mainly guest performances, focussed on the dance theater. The theatre as institution is owned by the government of the city of Z√ºrich, and the building by the Z√ºrcher Frauenverein (ZFV) cooperative. Theatersaal  History  The Rigiblick building was built near the upper terminus of the present Seilbahn Rigiblick to house a restaurant with terrace and a large hall. It quickly became a social meeting place and a popular destination. In 1914 the Z√ºrcher Frauenverein (literally: Z√ºrich Women's Association) bought the building complex, which remained until 1976 in its possession, and then went over to the city government of Z√ºrich. The hall was henceforth utilized primarily as a rehearsal room. Then there were plans to core the hall, intentionally to incorporate student housing. Local residents successfully opposed the governmental plans, by establishing the Verein Quartierkultur im Kreis 6 (analogously \\"club district culture 6\\") in 1984, and the next year they founded the Verein Theatersaal Rigiblick (analogously \\"club auditorium Rigiblick\\"). Bruno Steiner became the theater's first director, and from spring 1986 the Vorb√ºhne Z√ºrich, first on a provisional basis, provided various events, chiefly theater and dance performances, concerts, readings, public discussions and exhibitions. Thanks to the urban subsidies, that have been doubled from 1987 (50,000 Swiss Francs per year) by 2003, the theater operation was continuously expanded. The performances were operated by a small budget and staff in voluntary work. Approximately one third of the performances were of Z√ºrich artists (at a reduced loan) from the city districts of Oberstrass, Unterstrass and Fluntern, but artists from other parts of Switzerland and also from neighboring countries denied the majority of the theater program. The theater thus transformed from a place for neighborhood culture to a stage for events of pan-municipal interest. Despite the mixed program, the performances of the free dance scene was the theater's traditional focus: the Swiss professional association for dance and gymnastics' (German: Schweizerischer Berufsverband f√ºr Tanz und Gymnastik SBTG) organized decades before, from 1948 to 1968 regular international summer courses, which involved teachers from the whole European German-speaking linguistic area. The importance of the theater as a venue grew also after the \\"Depot Hardturm\\" and the \\"Theater West End\\" stages had been closed as venues for the free dance scene. In 2002 the ZFV-Unternehmungen cooperative (formerly Z√ºrcher Frauenverein) repurchased the building complex, however, the hall of the theater remained in the possession of the city government of Z√ºrich. An extensive renovation of the facility was carried out in the same year, and under the direction of the Swiss actor Daniel Rohr, on 13 January 2005 Tania Blixen's \\"Babette's Fest\\", a guest performance of the Zimmertheater T√ºbingen, opened the venue's news season. Since 2003 the number of visitors has tripled to over 30,000 a year. About 250 events annually attract an audience far beyond the city of Z√ºrich. Its artistic broad and high-quality program both guest international performances as well as a podium for young performers and for creative artists of various lines. On occasion of Margrit Rainer's 100th birthday, in September 2014 premiered Euse Rainer ch√∂nnt das au!, a play respectively musical dedicated to Margrit Rainer, who's still popular although she died 32 years ago. In the fiscal period 2014‚Äì2017 an annual municipal subsidy of CHF 490,000, composed of an operating contribution of CHF 305,000 and an abatement of rent of CHF 185,000 financed the theater's operations. The equity ratio of the theater is over 75%, and its staff consists of eight full- time jobs, other tasks, as the bar and technical staff, are carried out by voluntary workers of the Verein Theater Rigiblick association.

Cape Verde is an island country about 900 km north-west of Guinea- Bissau, a coastal West African country. Both were colonies of the Portuguese Empire and they campaigned together for independence with a plan for unification, but the countries separated after 1980. Colonial history The area on the mainland under Portuguese rule now containing Guinea-Bissau was originally called \\"Guin√© de Cabo Verde\\". Cape Verde was a site of transit in the slave trade from Guinea-Bissau to the Americas. Portuguese Cape Verde supplied many colonial officials for the mainland Portuguese Guinea, later Guinea-Bissau, at one point making up three-quarters of the civil service. Independence Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau campaigned together for independence from Portugal, chiefly led by Am√≠lcar Cabral's Marxist African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde from 1956. Cape Verde provided the bourgeoisie that led the anti-colonial movement in Portuguese Guinea. An ideology of unity was key to Cabral's theory of African liberation, and Cabral was himself Cape Verdean Guinea-Bissauan, though the call for unity was partly a tactic to avoid Guinea-Bissau becoming independent without Cape Verde, as the latter had closer ties to Portugal. The PAIGC then fought the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence (part of the wider Portuguese Colonial War), and declared independence in 1973, being formally granted independence in September 1974. Cape Verde joined Guinea-Bissau in independence from Portugal when it peacefully negotiated independence on 5 July 1975, following the April 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, and Aristides Pereira of the PAIGC became president. The intent was unification, as written into the two countries' constitutions. The PAIGC viewed them as \\"sister republics\\" with \\"two bodies with only one heart\\", and the countries shared a flag and national anthem. However, the elites in Cape Verde opposed unification, there were constitutional and legal differences, and the trade between them was minor. On November 14, 1980, a coup by Jo√£o Bernardo Vieira against \\"foreign\\" mesti√ßos overthrew the government of Lu√≠s Cabral (half-brother of Am√≠lcar) in Guinea- Bissau, leading to Cape Verde separating under Pedro Pires on January 20, 1981 and forming the ruling African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV). 1980s-2000s From 1980 to 2000, during the Guinea Bissauan Presidency of Jo√£o Bernardo Vieira, the countries were less closely involved. Guinea-Bissau experienced a lack of development and periods of violence while Cape Verde was relatively stable. Guinea-Bissau was, like other \\"non-aligned\\" African states, closer to the Soviet Union, while Cape Verde, nominally Marxist, formed relations with Western countries due to a dependence on food imports following drought. Diplomatic relations were restored after the presidents met in June 1982, and an ambassador from Cape Verde was received by Guinea-Bissau in July 1983. After multi-party politics was introduced in Cape Verde in 1990, the victorious Movimento para Democracia changed the flag and national anthem away from being similar to that of Guinea-Bissau. They were both founder members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) in 1996, and are each members of the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In the 1998 Guinea-Bissau civil war, triggered by a crackdown on Senagelese separatists in Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde called for the withdrawal of troops from Senegal and Guinea-Conakry from Guinea-Bissau, there to support President Viera. Cape Verde also opposed President Viera's request for ECOWAS to send peacekeepers. Cape Verde took in refugees from Guinea-Bissau and helped to negotiate peace as part of the CPLP, with Cape Verdean foreign minister Jos√© Lu√≠s de Jesus chairing the discussions on a Portuguese warship that led to a ceasefire agreement. The Cape Verde president Peres also mediated during the violent 2005 presidential election campaign in Guinea-Bissau, and following the 2009 assassination of the president of Guinea-Bissau, Jo√£o Bernardo Vieira. Recent relations Relations have improved since the election of Malam Bacai Sanh√° in Guinea- Bissau in 2009. Guinea-Bissau has a Consulate General on Rua da Ilha de Santa Luzia in Praia, Cape Verde, which opened in October 2011, headed by C√¢ndido Barbosa. It had been planned since 1992. The air connection between the countries operated by TACV, which had been suspended following the April 2012 coup in Guinea-Bissau, was restored in June 2015 during a visit of Cape Verdean Prime Minister Jos√© Maria Neves to Bissau to meet Domingos Sim√µes Pereira and discuss economic and business relations. Neves had last visited in 2011. The countries signed an agreement on avoiding double taxation that September. Cultural relations Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau share the Portuguese language as their official language, and the Portuguese creole Crioulo language as a recognised language. Cape Verdean Guinea-Bissauans have formed an Associa√ß√£o dos Filhos e Descendentes de Cabo Verde, and Guinea- Bissauan Cape Verdeans, who number around 8-9000, have formed an Associacao dos Guineeneses Residentes em Cabo Verde. Despite their shared language and culture, immigrants from Guinea-Bissau are often viewed as \\"manjacos\\", a derogatory term used for people from mainland Africa and the legalisation of Guinea-Bissauans in Cape Verde has been long delayed.

He was born in Birchfield, then in Staffordshire, and died at Aston, Birmingham. Pallett was a right-handed lower-order batsman, though early in his career he batted higher up the batting order, and a right-arm slow bowler. Prominent in Birmingham area club cricket, he played for Warwickshire from 1883, though the county's games were not considered first-class until 1894, and the team was not included in the County Championship until 1895. At the end of the 1886 season, he was picked for a non-Test match England XI to play the Australian touring team under the captaincy of W. G. Grace and this game was his first-class cricket debut. He then played for the North against the 1890 Australians, in the 1891 North v South match, and for a team representing \\"Second-Class Counties\\" against the 1893 Australians: in none of these matches did he make much impact with either bat or ball. In 1894, Warwickshire's matches against first-class teams were deemed also to be first-class, and Pallett played 15 matches that year, with outstanding success: he took 79 wickets at an average of 11.87 and among significant wicket-takers was behind only Test cricketers Dick Pougher and Tom Richardson in the national averages. He took five wickets in an innings 10 times and had three 10-wicket matches. His best return of the season, and of his entire first-class career, came in the match against Essex at Leyton, when he took nine first-innings wickets for 55 runs and followed that with five for 45 in the second innings for a match return of 14 for 100. He took a further 11 wickets in the return match at Edgbaston two weeks later. The more competitive cricket that Warwickshire's entry into the County Championship in 1895 brought had some impact on Pallett's bowling figures, but with 95 wickets at an average of 21.49 he was the team's leading wicket-taker and second only to the irregular bowler Alfred Glover in terms of average. His best bowling came in an early-season game against Derbyshire, when he took eight first- innings wickets for 69 runs, and these were the best Championship figures he achieved in his career. He was less effective in 1896, when his 74 wickets cost more than 25 runs apiece, and even less so in 1897, with a poor return of 44 wickets costing more than 33 runs each. In these seasons, however, his batting improved and he made two scores of 55, the first of them, against Surrey in 1896, being not out and therefore counting as his highest first- class score. After a few games in 1898, he disappeared from first-class cricket, although he played in a few Minor Counties matches for Staffordshire in 1903. By profession, he was a schoolmaster.

Currently, the Siberian tiger inhabits the cold mountains of the Russian Far East and northern China.  History  Two Siberian tigers at Harbin Siberian Tiger Park, Northeast China Genetic studies have revealed that Siberian and Caspian tigers are descended from the tiger population that colonized Central Asia about 10,000 years ago. Siberian tigers used to be common on either side of the Amur River in Russia and China, as well as in northeastern Mongolia and South Korea. Caspian tigers lived around the Caspian sea in Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkmenistan, and also further away in Armenia, Georgia and Turkey and Kazakhstan all the way to the Altai Mountains in the East. Caspian tigers reportedly became extinct in the 1970s after many years of hunting, poaching and habitat loss. Siberian tigers lost most of their ranges in Siberia and China and became extinct in the wild of Korea and Mongolia.  Siberian Tiger Project  A Siberian tiger at Minnesota Zoo The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) began working in the Russian Far East in 1992 to help conserve rare umbrella species like Siberian tigers, Amur leopards and Blakiston's fish owls, whose survival ultimately requires the conservation of the forest ecosystem as a whole. The WCS founded the Siberian Tiger Project in cooperation with the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve at the same time. The goal of the Siberian Tiger Project is to collect the best possible scientific information on tiger behavior and ecology for use in conservation plans. The project has studied Siberian tigers by radio-tracking more than 60 individuals since 1992. The Siberian Tiger Project combines traditional Russian and international approaches to conduct field research and is the world's longest running radio-telemetry based tiger research and conservation effort.  Introduction efforts  A Siberian tiger at the Rehabilitation Center in the village of Alekseevka, Primorsky Krai, Russia Introduction projects for Siberian tigers have been proposed for the Middle East, Central Asia and North Asia. = Kazakhstan = Siberian tigers are set to be introduced to areas in Kazakhstan where Caspian tigers once lived. A national park tentatively known as Caspian Tiger National Park for introduced tigers might be opened in 2019. The Amu Darya river delta was suggested as a potential site. A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area was suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers. A viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least 5,000 km2 (1,930 sq mi) of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations. Such a habitat is not available at this stage and also cannot be provided in the short term. The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for introduction at this stage. The southeastern shore of Lake Balkhash where the Ili River discharges and forms a large delta was also chosen as a suitable habitat. Igor Chestin, director of the Russian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), hopes to reintroduce tigers into the region within the next few years, though there is a need to enlarge the potential prey base by increasing the existing populations of saiga antelope, roe deer and wild boar the area. On 8 September 2017, the government of Kazakhstan announced the outline of its tiger reintroduction program and signed a memorandum with the WWF for assistance. Tigers will be introduced in the extensive riparian forest along the southeastern shore of Lake Balkhash. On 1 January 2018, the government will designate a new nature reserve in the area to restore the degraded habitat and protect it thereafter. The restoration will include the reintroduction of the locally extinct Asiatic wild ass and Bactrian deer. It will also help protect Lake Balkhash. Conservationist hope to engage local communities in the program to help tackle poaching and other illegal activities. = Iran = Siberian tigers might be introduced to areas in northern Iran where Caspian tigers once lived. In 2010, a pair of Siberian tigers sent by Russia to Iran's Tehran Zoological Garden (Eram Zoo) in exchange for a pair of Persian leopards were set to be introduced to the Miankaleh peninsula along the southeasternmost shore of the Caspian Sea within the next five years. In December 2010, one of the Siberian tigers at the Eram Zoo died due to a feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. In 2011, Iran requested four more Siberian tigers and invited conservation experts from Russia to support the introduction project for the Caspian Sea coast. Iran received two pairs of Siberian tigers in 2012. = Siberia = A 3-year-old male tiger, which was captured in a prey-depleted area, is released back into the wild The future introduction of Siberian tigers is planned as part of the ambitious rewilding project at Pleistocene Park in the Kolyma river basin in northern Yakutia, Russia, provided the population of herbivores reaches a size capable of supporting large predators. A Siberian tiger cub orphaned by poachers was rescued at Primorsky Krai in February 2012. The cub which turned out to be a female was rehabilitated and eventually released back into the wild in May 2013. In 2015, she gave birth to two cubs at Bastak Nature Reserve, becoming the first rehabilitated Siberian tiger to give birth in the wild. = Korea = North Korea was urged to join Russia and China in saving the Siberian tiger after the latest census revealed that only 562 individuals live in the wild. According to the director of the Amur branch of the WWF, analysis of satellite imagery of North Korea has shown that the northern part of the country has suitable conditions for releasing Siberian tigers.

Eureka Specialty Co.,77 F. 288, 1896 U.S. App. LEXIS 2241 (6th Cir. 1896). also known as the Peninsular Button-Fastener Case, was for a time a highly influential decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Many courts of appeals, and the United States Supreme Court in the A.B. Dick case. adopted its \\"inherency doctrine\\"‚Äî\\"the argument that, since the patentee may withhold his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it.\\"The quoted language is from . In 1917, however, the Supreme Court expressly overruled the Button-Fastener Case and the A.B. Dick case, in the Motion Picture Patents case. Background Button-Fastener had patents on machines for fastening buttons to high-button shoes with staples.The staples were unpatented and were not even an element in a combination claim of the patents. 77 F. at 289. This was a labor-intensive operation formerly done by hand at a higher cost. The invention saved considerable labor in making the shoes, although commercially exploiting the invention presented a marketing problem. The machines were worth much more to high-volume users than to low-volume users since the labor-saving benefits were directly proportional to the number of shoes on which the machines fastened buttons. But if Button-Fastener tried to sell the machines at different prices to the different users, there would be problems. First, it would be difficult or impossible to determine in advance of sale how intensively each shoe manufacturer would use the machines. Second, if the machines were sold cheaply to low-volume users, it would have been difficult or impossible to prevent those buyers from reselling their machines to those manufacturers that \\"should\\" pay a high price.See Ward S. Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 L.J. 19, 23 (1957). But Button- Fastener came up with a business model that solved the problem. It sold the machines subject to a condition spelled out in a plate fastened to each machine, that the machine must use only the staples that Button-Fastener made and sold. As it told the court in its legal papers, \\"it makes nothing in the sale of its machines, and ... the entire profits of its business are made in the sale of staples.\\" Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 65 F. 619, 621, 1895 U.S. App. LEXIS 3022 (C.C.D. Mich. 1895). In effect, the tie-in operated as a counter on the machines, counting the number of uses made of the invention. An above-market price for the staples provided a patent royalty proportional to use of the invention.Bowman at 23-24. But the high price for staples attracted an interloper. Eureka Specialty Co. began to sell the staples, an unpatented product, to some machine users. According to Button-Fastener, Eureka persuaded Button- Fastener's customers to disobey the notices on the machines. Trial court opinion Button-Fastener sued Eureka Specialty Co. for alleged infringement of its patents. In its pleadings, Button-Fastener described its business model of selling its patented machine only on condition that buyers of the machines obtain all their staples from Button-Fastener. It stated that notwithstanding its knowledge of this, Eureka \\"manufacture[d] staples adapted only for use in the machines so sold by [Button-Fastener], and persuade[d] the users of the machines to buy and use them in violation of the above-mentioned restriction.\\"Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 65 F. 619, 620, 1895 U.S. App. LEXIS 3022 (C.C.D. Mich. 1895). Eureka responded to the suit with a \\"demurrer\\" in which it said (1) its only business is selling unpatented staples to people using the machines, for which \\"they are not accountable\\" to Button-Fastener, and (2) Button-Fastener's restriction on the use of the machines \\"whereby a monopoly in an unpatented article is secured to the complainant, is contrary to public policy, and that a court of equity will not enforce it.\\"65 F. at 620. The court dismissed the first argument, particularly because Button-Fastener alleged that Eureka actively \\"persuade[d] the users of the machines to violate the supposed rights secured to [Button-Fastener] by the patent, and the restriction in the sale of its machines.\\" As to the second argument, however, the court agreed with Eureka, even though Button-Fastener submitted \\"a very able and ingenious argument ... to vindicate the general proposition that a patentee may deal with his patent as he likes and that the right is absolute.\\" The court said that it was: > persuaded that the patentee's privilege has its limitations, in the rights > and interests of the public, and that it is an abuse of his privilege to so > shape his dealings with his patent as to secure a monopoly upon an > unpatented article. It is hard to foresee to what extent such schemes might > be carried if patents can practically be broadened so as to gather in a > multitude of subjects now and always hitherto free from monopoly.65 F. at > 621. Button-Fastener argued that it, \\"having an absolute property right under its patent, might altogether refrain from putting its machines upon the market.\\" The court said that if the patent owner did that, it [622] \\"would defeat the just expectation of the public, and would not be consistent with the implications of his grant,\\" because \\"[t]he expectation is that he will promptly disclose the nature of his invention, and accord to the public, on reasonable terms, the use of it, and not that others should be shut out of that field for the period of 17 years, and the public be debarred from the benefits of like inventions during that whole period.\\" In any case, the court said, \\"I think a court of equity would be slow in lending its aid to such a course.\\" He said he would exercise his discretion to deny relief to Button- Fastener and therefore sustained Eureka's demurrer, dismissing the case.65 F. at 621-22. Sixth Circuit ruling Judge (later Justice) Lurton authored the opinion in the Button-Fastener case Button-Fastener appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The panel included Judge Lurton (later Justice Horace Lurton), who wrote the opinion, and Judge William H. Taft (later the President and then the Chief Justice). The court unanimously reversed. On appeal, Eureka \\"very earnestly and ably argued\\" that \\"the restrictions on use imposed by the complainant operate to create a monopoly in an unpatented article, and are therefore void as contrary to public policy, or, if valid as purely legal contracts, are so unconscionable as not to entitle complainant to equitable remedies for their enforcement.\\"77 F. at 289. The court acknowledged that it is the general rule that sale terminates the seller's rights over a sold article, as in Adams v. Burke. But the rule is different, the court said, when the sale is made subject to a condition. In this case, the court maintained: > In view of the conspicuous character of both the machine and the notice > permanently affixed thereon, every one buying must be conclusively presumed > to have notice that the owners of the patents intended by the inscription on > the machine to grant only a restricted license for its use, and it is > difficult to see why such purchaser is not to be regarded as acquiring and > accepting the structure subject to this restriction.77 F. at 290. Accordingly, the buyer does not acquire full rights over the purchased article: > The buyer of a machine undoubtedly obtains title to the materials embodying > the invention, subject to reverter in case of violation of the conditions of > the sale. But, as to the right to use the invention, he is obviously a mere > licensee, having no interest in the monopoly granted by the letters patent. > A license operates only as a waiver of the monopoly as to the licensee, and > estops the licensor from exercising its prohibitory powers in derogation of > the privileges conferred by him upon the licensee. That is, the sale of a patented machine may convey title to the pieces of metal and other material comprising the machine, but not a complete right to use the machine in any way the buyer chooses. Since the buyer acquired only a limited and conditional right to use the machine, i.e., a right to use it with the seller's staples, any other use is outside the scope of the license granted to the buyer.77 F. at 290-91 (\\"It must follow, therefore, that the purchaser of one of the complainant's machines subject to a restricted use takes the structure with a license to use the invention only with staples made by the patentee.\\" ). On the other hand, the machine buyer who uses Eureka's staples is an infringer: > [A] use prohibited by the license is a use in defiance of the monopoly > reserved by the patentee, and necessarily an unlawful invasion of the rights > secured to him by his patent. The license would be no defense to a suit for > infringement by a use in excess of its terms. The patentee has the exclusive > right of use, except in so far as he has parted with it by his license. The > essence of the monopoly conferred by the grant of letters patent is the > exclusive right to use the invention or discovery described in the patent. > This exclusive right of use is a true and absolute monopoly and is granted > in derogation of the common right, and this right to monopolize the use of > the invention or discovery is the substantial property right conferred by > law, and which the public is under obligation to respect and protect.77 F. > at 291. Lurton then turned to the public policy arguments‚Äîthat Button-Fastener was expanding its lawful monopoly over the patented machines to a second monopoly over unpatented staples: > What we are asked to do is to mark another boundary line around the > patentee's monopoly, which will debar him from engrossing the market for an > article not the subject of a patent. To do this, we are asked to say that he > cannot license others to use his invention on condition that they shall use > it only in conjunction with a nonpatentable article made by himself. The > only reason suggested for this limitation upon his right to define the terms > upon which others may use his invention is that a monopoly in the unpatented > article may thereby be created. Upon what authority are we to circumscribe > the exercise of the privileges awarded a patentee? In considering any > question in respect of restraints upon the liberty of contracting, imposed > by principles of public policy, we should bear in mind that very high > considerations of public policy are involved in the recognition of a wide > liberty in the making of contracts.77 F. at 294. The court said that freedom of contract trumps public policy here because of the inherent rights of a patent owner: > If he see fit, he may reserve to himself the exclusive use of his invention > or discovery. If he will neither use his device, nor permit others to use > it, he has but suppressed his own. That the grant is made upon the > reasonable expectation that he will either put his invention to practical > use, or permit others to avail themselves of it upon reasonable terms, is > doubtless true. This expectation is based alone upon the supposition that > the patentee's interest will induce him to use, or let others use, his > invention. The public has retained no other security to enforce such > expectations. A suppression can endure but for the life of the patent, and > the disclosure he has made will enable all to enjoy the fruit of his genius. > His title is exclusive, and so clearly within the constitutional provisions > in respect of private property that he is neither bound to use his discovery > himself, nor permit others to use it.77 F. at 294-95. Since the patentee has such absolute, inherent rights to withhold use of the patent, he could lawfully use that right to become the sole supplier of the article that the patent covers: > If the patentee choose to reserve to himself the exclusive use of his > device, and the invention be of a wide character, and so radical as to > enable him to make and sell an unpatentable product cheaper than any other > competitor, a practical monopoly of the market for that article will result; > and yet no one could say that a monopoly thus secured was illegitimate, or > obnoxious to public policy. To illustrate: Let it be supposed that the > patents owned by this complainant were of so wide a character as to cheapen > the process of manufacturing shoes, and to drive from competition all other > modes of manufacture. Then suppose the patentees were of opinion that they > could most profitably enjoy their inventions by retaining the monopoly of > the use and engaging in the manufacture of shoes. If content to undersell > all others, they could engross the market for shoes, to the extent of their > capacity to supply the demand during the life of their patents, or so long > as their invention was not superseded by subsequent inventions still further > cheapening the cost of manufacture. The monopoly thus secured would be the > legitimate consequence of the meritorious character of their invention. Yet > just such monopolies may result whenever a new and surprising advance is > made in some art of wide and general use. The great consuming public would > be benefited, rather than injured, for the monopoly could endure so long > only as shoes were supplied at a less price than had prevailed before the > invention.77 F. at 295. This logic can be extended, Lurton insisted, from shoes to button-fastener staples: > Now, if the patentees, by retaining to themselves the exclusive use of their > invention, are able, legitimately and lawfully, to acquire a monopoly of the > manufacture of shoes, and destroy the shoe market for those who before had > shared it, why may they not, by a system of restricted licenses, permit > others to use their devices on condition that only some minor part of the > shoe‚Äîthe pegs, the tips, the thread, or the buttons, or the button > fasteners‚Äîshall be bought from them? > If these concessions were such as to enable others to compete, though their > use of the mechanism was restricted by the terms of the license, who could > justly complain, if the inventors, content with a monopoly of the market for > the article named in their license, surrendered the opportunity for a > monopoly of the manufacture of the complete shoe? The device protected by > the patents owned by complainant is of no such wide or radical character as > that used for purposes of illustration. Yet there is no appreciable > difference in the legal principles applicable to the supposed facts used for > illustration, and those stated on the face of the complainant's bill. The court explained that any harm to competitive staple makers that may occur is not due to the conduct of the patentee but rather to the merit of the invention: > The fact which has affected the makers of wire staples for shoe > manufacturing is the invention of a machine which, by its simplicity, > superior capabilities, its cheapness and accuracy, has practically driven > all other methods of fastening buttons to shoes out of use. The older and > clumsier methods, on the allegations of the bill, have been completely > superseded. From this invention there results a large market for wire > staples, adapted in size and shape to use with the new mechanism, and a > second consequence is the complete cessation of the demand for button > fasteners not adapted to be used with complainant's machine.77 F. at 295-96. The court explained that the patent holder's purpose was merely to adjust the payment made for use of the invention to the value of the benefit conferred: > The inventions covered by complainant's patents are not of such character as > to enable them, by retaining the exclusive use, to absorb either the making > of shoes, or the minor work of fastening buttons to shoes. In the exercise > of the right of exclusive use, they have put on the market a structure > embodying their devices, and licensed the purchaser to use the invention > \\"only with staples\\" made by themselves. > In other words, they have chosen to fix the price for the right of use [of > the invention] at the profit resulting from the sale of staples. As observed > by counsel for complainant, \\"The fasteners are thus made the counters by > which the royalty proportioned to the actual use of the machine is > determined.\\" > This method of licensing their mechanism may or may not result in the > engrossment of the market for staples. So long as their invention controls > the market for button-fastening appliances, and to the extent that their > machines shall supersede other modes of clinching staples, just so long will > they be enabled to control the market for staples. Their monopoly in an > unpatented article will depend upon the merit of their patented device, and > the extent to which other clinching devices are superseded by it. In the > last analysis, the invention destroyed the demand for sizes and shapes of > staples not adapted to use with the machine of complainant. > . . . The monopoly in the unpatented staple results as an incident from the > monopoly in the use of complainant's invention, and is therefore a > legitimate result of the patentee's control over the use of his invention by > others. Depending, as such a monopoly would, upon the merits of the > invention to which it is a mere incident, it is neither obnoxious to public > policy, nor an illegal restraint of trade.77 F. at 296. Since the machine purchasers who use Eureka staples infringe the patent, \\"it would seem to follow that the defendants, who aid and abet such infringement by intentionally and maliciously persuading and inducing the licensees of such machines to exceed their licenses, and by furnishing them with the means for such infringement are themselves infringers, and liable as tortfeasors.\\" Subsequent events In 1912, in Henry v. A.B. Dick Co. the Supreme Court endorsed, reaffirmed, and adopted the reasoning of the Button-Fastener case. In an endnote, the Court collected citations to the many lower court opinions that had followed the Button-Fastener precedent between 1896 and 1912. In 1917, the Supreme Court overruled the A.B. Dick and Button-Fastener cases in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.,. In 1992, in Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., the Federal Circuit revived the doctrine of the Button-Fastener case, at least partially. The court held that the patent exhaustion doctrine did not apply when a patentee sold a patented product subject to a condition other than a price fix or tie in, unless \\"the patentee has ventured beyond the patent grant and into behavior having an anticompetitive effect not justifiable under the rule of reason.\\"Mallinckrodt, 976 F.2d at 708. Despite the sweeping language of cases such as Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., the court held that the Supreme Court had only held post-sale restrictions invalid in price-fixing and tie-in cases, and therefore the general language outlawing post-sale restrictions was merely obiter dicta that could be ignored. The Federal Circuit reaffirmed this doctrine in 2016 in Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc., and Impression petitioned for certiorari. The Supreme Court has invited the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the United States.Impression Prods. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., No. 15-1189, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 3982 (June 20, 2016). In October 2016, the government filed the requested amicus curiae brief. It recommended grant of certiorari on both questions. The brief argues that the \\"Federal Circuit's decision misreads\\" the Supreme Court's precedents and \\"would substantially erode the exhaustion doctrine.\\"Brief For The United States As Amicus Curiae on petition for certiorari at 5. On December 2, 2016, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.Impression Prods. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 2016 U.S. LEXIS 7275. Commentary ‚óè In 1912, New York lawyer Gilbert H. Montague praised the Button-Fastener case as \\"this masterly decision\\" and \\"the foundation of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.\\", in the Yale Law Journal.Gilbert H. Montague, The Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Patent Law, 21 L.J. 433, 454 (1912). He asserted that Lurton's opinion demolished the argument that the patentee was obtaining a practical monopoly of the market for unpatentable staples, previously an ordinary article of commerce: > The court disposed of this objection by showing that such \\"practical > monopoly,\\" far from offending public policy, actually promotes the general > welfare, because the patentees can attain it only \\"by cheapening the cost of > manufacture,\\" and can continue it only \\"so long as their invention was not > superseded by subsequent inventions still further cheapening the cost of > manufacture.\\" So cogent is the reasoning of the Court that it deserves > careful attention.21 at 451. Montague also praised A.B. Dick, in which Lurton continued his development of the inherency doctrine: \\"Not since the creation of the patent system,\\" Montague declared, \\"has the Supreme Court rendered a better considered decision affecting patent rights.\\"21 at 583. (This is Part II of the preceding Montague article, and it is captioned The Supreme Court on Patents.) Montague argued in favor of the \\"counting mechanism\\" argument that Button-Fastener's counsel made to justify the tie-in of staples, which was later taken up by Chicago School analysts to justify any tie-in which patented devices are used in variable proportionSee, for example, Kenneth J. Burchfiel, Patent Misuse And Antitrust Reform: \\"Blessed Be The Tie?\\", 4 1, 81 (1991) (\\"Moreover, as already pointed out, economists do not object if a buyer is 'forced' to buy a tied product, as long as it . . . is merely a counter to determine the intensity of use of the tying product, and the total supply of the tied product is not reduced for the buying public.\\") to output results: > In the case of innumerable patented machines, no accurate or convenient > measure of the amount of use and output is afforded, except by measuring the > supplies used in connection, with the machine. By requiring the user of the > patented article to obtain such material from a single source, the patent > owner, insures the means of accurately, inexpensively and conveniently > measuring the amount of use and output of the patented article, and > collecting the royalty so determined, by charging for such supplies a sum > sufficient to cover their cost, and also an additional amount in the nature > of a royalty for the use of the patented article. As regards many patented > articles, which otherwise could be sold only in small numbers, at a large > outright purchase price, no other means of determining a royalty, based upon > the amount of use and output, can be devised.21 at 595. Montague also contended that the tie-in was justifiable because it permitted users to pay for use of the invention as they exploited it rather than entirely up front: \\"Under such an arrangement, the money burden upon the licensee does not fall upon him all at one time, like the necessity of paying at the outset a large purchase price, but is distributed over a period sufficient to enable him to derive, from the use of the patented article, the means of compensating the patent owner.\\" ‚óè In 1942, patent lawyer Giles Rich (as he then was, later Judge Rich of the Federal Circuit) commented on the Button-Fastener case. He pointed to the passage in the opinion in which Judge Lurton said that public policy was no issue because the patentee created the market for the staples. Judge Lurton said (as quoted by Rich): > The fact which has affected the makers of wire staples for shoe > manufacturing is the invention of a machine which, by its simplicity, > superior capabilities, its cheapness and accuracy, has practically driven > all other methods of fastening buttons to shoes out of use. . . . From this > invention there results a large market for wire staples. . . . The monopoly > in the unpatented staples results [according to this decision] as an > incident from the monopoly iii the use of complainant's invention, and is > therefore a legitimate result of the patentee's control over the use of his > invention by others. Depending, as such monopoly would, upon the merits of > the invention to which it is a mere incident, it is neither obnoxious to > public policy, nor an illegal restraint of trade. Rich commented: > The conclusion to be drawn from this is that Judge Lurton held to the > economic theory that one who creates a market should be allowed to engross > it. Such is not now nor ever has been a policy adhered to or sanctioned by > any American government, so far as we know. It certainly was never a part of > any statute passed in furtherance of the Constitutional purpose \\"to promote > the progress of science and useful arts,\\" either expressly or by > implication.Giles S. Rich, The Relation Between Patent Practices and the > Anti-Monopoly Laws, 24 J. 241, 254 (1942). Rich also criticized the notion of using the staples tie-in as a counting device, based on the theory of selling the machine but not its use‚Äîreserving the latter with a license bearing a running royalty. Rich commented (seemingly sarcastically), \\"It was indeed a great mind that conceived the idea of making the purchaser of anything pay the one who sold it to him a royalty according to the amount of its use, by separating the right to use from ownership and renaming the purchaser 'licensee.' \\"Rich at 262.

He was born in Colwich, Staffordshire and died at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Pereira was sent to The Oratory School at Edgbaston at the age of 10 on the death of his father and came under the influence of Cardinal Newman; he became a Roman Catholic priest and schoolmaster. By 1910, he was headmaster of the Oratory School and he was in charge at the time of its move from Birmingham to Caversham, near Reading, where his family had owned property. He retired from the headmastership in 1930, and was named as Warden in 1934, but was forced by ill health to retire to Birmingham Oratory in 1935. As a cricketer, Pereira was a right-handed middle order batsman; he also bowled right-arm fast, but only bowled two overs in first-class cricket. He played five times for Warwickshire in 1895 and 1896 and his best batting came in his first match, the game against Kent, when he top-scored with 34 in Warwickshire's first innings and made 24, just one behind Willie Quaife's 25, in the second. Against the 1896 Australians, he was praised for his fielding, being rated as the finest fielder at point that the Australians had encountered.

Background  About 185,000 years ago, a side lobe of the Walensee/Rein glacier overlapped on the threshold at the present Pfannenstiel eastern slope from Hombrechtikon into the Glatttal towards Niederweningen, and eroded the overdeepened rock rut of the present Wehntal area. During melting of the glacier, Wehntal, the lower Glatttal and Furttal valleys filled about 180,000 to 150,000 years ago with cold glacial lakes. After another glacier maximum about 140,000 years ago, the ice melted in the last Eemian (interglacial) period back far into the alpine valleys, and during the W√ºrm glaciation and again about 45,000 years ago, mammoths and other Ice Age animals lived in the largely silted Wehntal. With the increasing warming period about 20,000 years ago, the glaciers melted away in stages to Z√ºrich, later Hurden and formed the Seedamm at the Obersee lake area respectively the Ufenau, L√ºtzelau and Heilig H√ºsli islands on Z√ºrichsee, and finally retreated into the alpine mountains.  History and orientation  In 1890 the most important site of Ice Age animals in Switzerland was discovered in Niederweningen: 100 bones, molar teeth and tusks of at least 7 different individuals of mammoths, including a very young calf, were found in a peat horizon at the base of a gravel pit. 2003 mammoth find in Niederwenigen, display at the museum Particularly the uppermost deposits with the so-called Mammut turf layer were studied up in about depth, and between 1983 and 1985 by three research boreholes to a depth of . In 2003 the remains of a mammoth were found, and further finds resulted in the establishment of the present Mammutmuseum Niederweningen near the site of the first findings. Various exhibits range from the colonization in historical times to the flora and fauna of the Ice Age, and further back to the living resources of the tropical Jura sea. Along with the historical finds of 1890/91, further at least ten mammoths have been found nearby, including a very young mammoth calf. Other fossil finds date back to other glacial animals, such as woolly rhinoceros, wild horse, steppe bison, wolf and cave hyena. In October 2015 an interactive multimedia installation for the visitors was inaugurated, when the exhibition was renewed on occasion of the museum's 10th anniversary. One of the most important objects in the museum are the reconstructions of the 2003 finding and of a mammoth calf found near the museum site in 2005. The museum also houses the geological project Eiszeiten und Klimawandel der vergangenen 500 000 Jahre im Wehntal, that researched the climate change and glacial periods of the last 500,000 years in the Wehntal valley. The past ten years more than 41,000 visitors have viewed the exhibitions. The small museum team is also supported by a volunteer team of 35 active members of its booster club.  Facilities  Public transportation is provided by the S-Bahn Z√ºrich line S15 (ZVV) to Niederweningen Dorf. The museum is located about from the station. As the museum (as of May 2016) only opens Sunday's 2 pm to 5 pm, after hours visits are available by appointment, as well as guided tours for groups.

As part of a documentary she was making about the song and its history, she had paid 1,500 to secure the rights. She had become interested in the culture of birthday celebrations while working on the MTV reality show My Super Sweet 16, and in 2016 described having launched her four-year \\"campaign to liberate the people's song\\" as \\"a matter of conscience\\". Her complaint relied heavily on research by US law professor Robert Brauneis, and sought not only the return of her money but all royalties collected by the company from other filmmakers since 2009. A week later a similar case was filed in the Central District of California, Rupa Marya v. Warner Chappell Music Inc, Case No. 2:13-cv-04460. Five weeks later, Nelson refiled the case there,Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Good Morning To You Productions Corp. v. Warner/Chappell Music, Docket No. 1:13-cv-04040 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 26, 2013). and the cases were combined.Third Amended Consolidated Complaint, Good Morning to You Productions Corp. v. Warner/Chappell Music, Docket No. 2:13-cv-04460 (C.D. Cal. November 6, 2013). As of April 2014, Warner's motion to dismiss had been denied without prejudice, and discovery began under an agreed plan with respect to Claim One, declaratory judgment as to whether \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" is in the public domain. The Motion Cut-Off as to Merits Issues on the Claim One deadline was November 7, 2014. After that, the court was expected to rule on the motion for summary judgment as to the merits issues on Claim One.Dkt. 89 (Joint Report Rule 26(f) Discovery Plan) A jury trial was requested.Amended Complaint, Dkt. 75. On July 28, 2015, one day prior to a scheduled ruling, Nelson's attorneys Betsy Manifold and Mark Rifkin presented new evidence which they argued was conclusive proof that the song was in the public domain, \\"thus making it unnecessary for the Court to decide the scope or validity of the disputed copyrights, much less whether Patty Hill abandoned any copyright she may have had to the lyrics.\\" Several weeks prior, they had been given access to documents held back from them by Warner/Chappell, which included a copy of the 15th edition of The Everyday Song Book, published in 1927. The book contained \\"Good Morning and Happy Birthday\\", but the copy was blurry, obscuring a line of text below the title. Manifold and Rifkin located a clearer copy of an older edition, published in 1922, that also contained the \\"Happy Birthday\\" lyrics. The previously obscured line was revealed to be the credit \\"Special permission through courtesy of The Clayton F Summy Co.\\". Manifold and Rifkin argued that because the music and lyrics were published without a valid copyright notice as was required at the time, \\"Happy Birthday\\" was in the public domain. Warner/Chappell disputed the evidence, arguing that unless there was \\"necessary authorization from the copyright owner\\", the \\"Happy Birthday\\" lyrics and sheet music would still be subject to common law copyright as an unpublished work, and that it was unknown whether the \\"special permission\\" from the Summy Company covered \\"Good Morning to All\\", \\"Happy Birthday\\", or both, thus alleging that the publication in The Everyday Song Book was unauthorized. The company also argued that it was not acting in bad faith in withholding the evidence of the 1927 publication. On September 22, 2015, federal judge George H. King ruled. that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim over the lyrics was invalid. The 1935 copyright held by Warner/Chappell applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, not the lyrics or melody. The court held that the question of whether the 1922 and 1927 publications were authorized, thus placing the song in the public domain, presented questions of fact that would need to be resolved at trial. However, Warner/Chappell had failed to prove that it actually had ever held a copyright to the lyrics, so the court was able to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs, thus resolving the case. Some initial news sources characterized the decision as ruling that the song was in the public domain, but the decision did not go so far, holding only that Warner/Chappell did not prove they owned the copyright. However, because there are no other claimants to the copyright, and the copyright to the melody long ago expired,. the plaintiffs suggested that the song is effectively in the public domain. Prior to the lawsuit, Warner/Chappell had been earning $2 million a year licensing the song for commercial use. In February 2016 Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million, paving the way for the song to become public domain.

It was the centerpiece of a summer estate owned by Minneapolis businessman Rufus Rand, Sr., and his wife Susan Mealey. The Rand House and a nearby building were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as the Rufus Rand Summer House and Carriage Barn for having local significance in the themes of architecture, commerce, and entertainment/recreation. They were nominated for being representative of the late-19th-century country estates built by Twin Cities businessmen, their Queen Anne architecture, and association with Rand, a prominent utility executive. Description The Rand House is a -story wood- frame building with 30 rooms. It stands on a hill southeast of downtown Monticello. Queen Anne architectural features include a polygonal corner tower, wraparound porches, patterned shingles on the gables, irregular plan, and multi-gabled roof. Built as a summer home, the house had open porches and large windows. Exterior window shutters were affixed to help seal the house up over the winter. The carriage barn is a -story frame building south of the main house. In 1952 it was converted to a single-family home under separate ownership. The estate grounds once featured an arboretum, swimming pool, windmill, and flower gardens, all ringed by a lilac hedge. Only traces of the gardens and walls remain. History Rufus Rand was the vice-president of the Minneapolis Gas Light Company in 1884 when he married Susan Mealey, daughter of state senator Tobias Mealey. As a gift the bride's parents gave a prominent hilltop property near their own house on the outskirts of Monticello, and Rand invited his new wife to design a summer home for them as her wedding gift. As railway connections to the countryside around Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul emerged, it had become common for wealthy businessmen from the cities to construct rural estates for summer getaways. Rand ultimately became president of the Gas Light Company and died in 1921. The house remained in the Rand family for over 60 years. During World War II the U.S. Army Air Corps was training glider pilots in Monticello, and the Rand family loaned them the property for officers' quarters. The house was later converted for use as a nursing home, then a funeral home. In 1986 it was acquired by Duffy and Merrill Busch, who renovated the property and began operating it as a bed and breakfast.

Life Oppenheim was born in Brno, Moravia and received education in that part of Austria-Hungary. He went to Karl Ferdinand's University, Prague in 1899 to earn his Medical Degree. He then went to Berlin Dentalpoliclinic to earn his Dental Degree in 1904. He then practiced with Dr. Weiser in Vienna at his practice until 1914. During World War I, he served as head of Army Hospital and in 1915 was appointed Privatdozent on Head of Orthodontics Department at University of Vienna. In 1938, Dr. Oppenheim went to Geneva, Switzerland because of the political tensions of World War II. He moved to USA in 1939 after getting an appointment as a faculty at University of Southern California. His introduction to Edward Angle happened when he gave lectures at Angle School of Orthodontia when it was in New London, Connecticut. After spending some time in US, Dr. Oppenheim along with Grunberg went back to Europe and brought back teachings of Angle to several institutions. Career One of his articles Tissue Changes, Particularly of the Bone, Incident to Tooth Movement was published in Angel Orthodontist in 1911. In this publication, Dr. Oppenheim showed the movement of teeth happens due to complete reorganization of the involved bone tissue. He also showed that pull that happens from ligatures on a heavy base wire acts like a lever instead of a post in the ground. In subsequent publications later on, Dr. Oppenheim proposed that using gentle forces with long intervals of rest between had many advantages in Orthodontics.

Born in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Schmertz attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he wrote the Carnegie Tartans' fight song, \\"Fight for the Glory of Carnegie,\\" and played the banjo in a jazz orchestra; after he graduated with an architecture degree in 1921, Schmertz designed buildings. He taught at Carnegie for more than thirty-five years before his retirement. As a folk musician, Schmertz released four albums, with his third, Sing Oh! The City Oh!: Songs of Early Pittsburgh, in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Pittsburgh's founding; a reviewer for Keystone Folklore Quarterly called it \\"tuneful and well-done in the folk tradition\\". Before his death, Schmertz completed a book of his songs, but died before it published. Ten days after he suffered a stroke, Schmertz died on June 7, 1975. Early life Schmertz was born on March 4, 1898, in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After he completed studies at Peabody High School, where he met his future wife, Mildred, Schmertz attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology (today, Carnegie Mellon University). In May 1917 Schmertz, dressed in \\"light flannel trousers, a girl's middy blouse and a small white hat,\\" was arrested after he stood outside a theater and encouraged persons exiting the theater to join the navy as, according to Schmertz, a part of an initiation ritual to join a fraternity; he was charged with mocking the uniform but a magistrate later dismissed the charge. First section, p. 3 At Carnegie, Schmertz wrote the Carnegie Tartans' fight song, \\"Fight for the Glory of Carnegie\\", wrote college musicals, led a dance band, played the banjo in a jazz orchestra, and worked on the Carnegie yearbook staff. Fifth section, p. 10 In 1921, he graduated with a degree in architecture. Architecture and professorship As an architect, Schmertz designed the St. Michael's of the Valley Church in Rector, Pennsylvania, and the renovation of the Unity Chapel in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. In 1930, the Common Brick Manufacturers' Association of America in Cleveland, Ohio, awarded Schmertz an honorable mention in a \\"houses already built\\" contest. Three years later, Schmertz served on a Pittsburgh-based American Institute of Architects executive committee that sought to identify western Pennsylvanian buildings constructed before 1860. Schmertz worked as a member of Fisher and Schmertz, and, later, headed the firm of Schmertz, Erwin and Associates. According to George Swetnam of The Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine, \\"many\\" of the buildings Schmertz designed were homes. Schmertz taught design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology for more than thirty- five years. At Carnegie, Schmertz worked on a team that designed a cyclotron for the university in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. Schmertz retired from his professorship in 1965 (named a professor emeritus), but was teaching at the university in 1973. Folk musician In 1949, Schmertz, who played the banjo in college, recorded an LP, Songs by Robert Schmertz, after his friends bought him studio time. Schmertz's second studio album, Robert Schmertz Sings His Songs, was released in 1955: from the album, Burl Ives covered \\"Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee\\" on the Captain Kangaroo show. By 1958, a writer for the Deadwood Pioneer-Times in Deadwood, South Dakota, wrote that Schmertz was \\"rapidly gaining national prominence as an interpreter of American musical and lyrical idiom\\" after Schmertz wrote a song, \\"Swing Away, Pearly Gates,\\" for Edmund Karlsrud and the Concertmen, who performed it as a part of their 1957‚Äì1958 tour. In 1958, composer Elie Seigmeister and lyricist Edward Mabley cited Schmertz's \\"Monongahela Sal\\" and \\"Lock No. Ten\\" as inspiration for The Mermaid in Lock No. 7, a musical \\"in the folk idiom, expanded by modern, sophisticated treatment\\" that debuted at the American Wind Symphony Orchestra. Schmertz's third album, Sing Oh! the City Oh!: Songs of Early Pittsburgh, released on Folkways Records in 1959, featured folk songs, such as \\"Celeron\\", named after Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville, and \\"The Battle of Bushy Run\\", after the battle of the same name, in commemoration of the bicentennial of Pittsburgh's founding. A reviewer for Keystone Folklore Quarterly described the album, to which two of his children, Gretchen Schmertz Jacob and John Schmertz, contributed, as \\"tuneful and well-done in the folk tradition\\". A reviewer for Billboard magazine called it a \\"fascinating package of songs\\" that \\"will appeal to folklorists, educational groups, and, of course, residents of Pittsburgh particularly\\". Schmertz released his final album, Ladies Beware of an Architect: Songs for Architects and Their Girlfriends, in 1960. Schmertz's music has been covered by Pete Seeger, who called Schmertz a \\"very good songwriter\\", Burl Ives, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Bill and Gloria Gaither, The Statler Brothers, The Cathedrals, Dailey & Vincent, the River City Brass Band, and Ernie Haase & Signature Sound. Later life In 1970, Schmertz retired from his position at Schmertz, Erwin and Associates. In 1973, he resided in Ben Avon, Pennsylvania. With his wife, Mildred Floyd, an art teacher, Schmertz had four children: Gretchen Schmertz Jacob, John, Jack, and Mildred. Before his death, Schmertz compiled a book on his songs, though he died before it published. Ten days prior to his death, Schmertz sustained a stroke, and, on June 7, 1975, died after a long illness.

She is described in the Vita Ansgari. Frideborg is arguably the first historically confirmed woman in Sweden whose name is known. Life Frideborg is described as an independent wealthy widow with an adult daughter, Katla. When Ansgar and his assistant Witmar arrived in Birka on their mission, she offered to house them, and they accepted her offer. They described her as a friendly and motherly figure who took good care of them. When Ansgar founded his church, the first Christian one in Sweden, Frideborg and the king's stewart Hergeir were his first converts. The congregation largely consisted of foreign slaves who had already been Christians in their home countries. Frideborg is described as famed for her piety; after her baptism, she reportedly decided to give her property to the poor. As there was no poverty in Birka, her gift had to be sent to poor people far away. The only possession Frideborg kept was reportedly enough wine to be given holy communion at her deathbed, which she asked Katla to keep. Soon afterward, in 831 Ansgar and Witmar left Sweden. Twenty years later, in 851, Ansgar sent the hermit Ardgar to Birka to give Frideborg and Hergier holy communion before their deaths. Reportedly, they both died soon after. According to another version of this story, Frideborg had her gifts distributed posthumously; upon her deathbed, she asked Katla to distribute her inheritance among the poor. Unable to find poor people in Birka, Katla travelled to Dorestad in Friesland, where she carried out her mother's wish. According to the Vita Ansgari, a miracle occurred afterward: she found that she had as much money in her purse after having given away her inheritance as she had had before. There are theories that Frideborg was originally from Friesland. This would mean she was already Christian at the time of Ansgar's visit, and that her daughter thereby returned to her mother's birth country (if she did indeed visit Dorestad).Hallstr√∂m, Gunnar, M√§lar√∂arnas historia: en bok om forntid och medeltid, Bokf√∂rl.

It was soon sent north to the Volkhov Front near Novgorod. In the winter of 1942 it participated in an offensive to try to break the Siege of Leningrad which ended with it and most of the rest of the attacking force being cut off and gradually annihilated during the spring. A second 305th was raised a few months later in the southern part of the front, where it distinguished itself in the final liberation of Belgorod. It continued in combat through Ukraine and Poland before ending the war near Prague.  1st Formation  The 305th Rifle Division began forming on July 2, 1941 at Dmitrov in the Moscow Military District.Walter S.

Dmitrii Ivanovich Barabanshchikov was appointed to command of the division the day it started forming, and he would remain in this position until nearly the end of this formation's existence. After several weeks forming up as was typical for the divisions being formed from reservists in this period, the 305th was shipped north in early August to the area around Novgorod, where it came under command of the Northwestern Front's Novgorod Operations Group,Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 joining the remnants of the 16th Rifle Corps' 237th Rifle Division and 1st Mountain Rifle Brigade. By October 1 the Group consisted of the 305th, the 180th and 185th Rifle Divisions, plus the 3rd Tank Division, which had no tanks and was converting to infantry. The Group was defending a 30km sector along the Volkhov River from Dubrovka to Lake Ilmen.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941 ‚Äì 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 91, 95, 558, 561 On November 12 the division was ordered into an attack, along with the 180th, in support of 52nd Army's attempt to cut off the German forces that were withdrawing from Tikhvin. This attack against the scattered positions of the Spanish Blue Division in the Malaya Vishera area made few gains but did hold that division in place. In December the 305th was reassigned to 52nd Army in Volkhov Front.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 105‚Äì07, 505 It took part in the Lyuban Offensive Operation during the winter months of 1942, entering the penetration of the German front across the Volkhov that was created by 2nd Shock Army in an attempt to drive into the rear of the German forces laying siege to Leningrad.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 While significant gains were made, the operation depended on maintaining two narrow supply corridors, which forces of German 18th Army succeeded in cutting between March 18 ‚Äì 20. The 305th Rifle was now trapped in the half-frozen swamps south of Lyuban, and while it made valiant efforts to restore the situation over the coming months,Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 176‚Äì79 by June 1 it was reporting to 2nd Shock Army that its strength was down to 860 officers, 753 NCOs and 3,208 men. On June 8 Colonel Barabanshchikov was replaced by Col. Aleksandr Pavlovich Tarasov. The division was finally destroyed in late June as the Germans \\"mopped up\\" the pocket, and it was officially disbanded on July 7.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70  2nd Formation  Col. A. F. Vasilev (center) shares apparent good news with subordinates at his forward outpost in Shliakhovoe, during the Battle of Kursk.The second 305th Rifle Division was formed from the 75th Fortified Region on October 26, 1942 in 60th Army in the Voronezh Front.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 120 Its order of battle remained as previous. Col. Aleksandr Petrovich Krutikhin was appointed as commander when the division was reformed, and would remain in command until January 2, 1943, when he was replaced by Col. Ivan Antinovich Danilovich. The division remained in that Army for the remainder of the year, then moved to Front reserves, then to 40th Army, and in February 1943 to the newly-formed 69th Army.http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/943RGCC.PDF , p. 50 Colonel Danilovich was in turn replaced on May 2 by Col. Aleksandr Fyodorovich Vasilev, who would continue in command for the duration of the war. In the planning for the Soviet defense against the expected German offensive around the Kursk salient, the commander of Voronezh Front, Army Gen. N. F. Vatutin, placed his 69th Army, of five rifle divisions, in the second echelon to guard the juncture of his 6th and 7th Guards Armies in the first echelon. The 305th was assigned to the new 48th Rifle Corps, along with the 107th and 183rd Rifle Divisions, just one day before the Battle of Kursk began. At this time the division had a total strength of 7,778 men, 334 light and heavy machine guns, 219 anti-tank rifles, 157 mortars (from 50mm to 120mm calibre), and 80 guns (45mm to 122mm calibre).Valeriy Zamulin, The Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, Helion & Co. Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 26-28, 411 As elements of the German III Panzer Corps pushed through towards Melikhovo on July 8, General Vatutin ordered the division forward at around 1100 hrs. to help plug the gaps that were opening in the first echelon. Due to slow communications Colonel Vasilev did not receive the order until 1620 hrs., and the full division was not on the road until 1930. In addition, since 69th Army was not on high priority for replacements, the division was short about 70% of its required horse transport, and each infantryman was required to carry one artillery shell in addition to his regular equipment. Despite these and other difficulties (one battalion commander plus two of his senior subordinates got drunk and lost all control of their unit), by dawn on July 9 most of the 1004th Rifle Regiment had arrived to reinforce the defense of the village of Shliakhovoe along with battalions from the 280th Guards Rifle Regiment of 92nd Guards Rifle Division, which had fallen back from Melikhovo. The 1002nd Regiment, with the 2nd battalion of the 830th Artillery, deployed on unfortified ground to back up the rest of the 92nd Guards, while the 1000th took up positions to the east which were not in direct contact with the enemy.Zamulin, pp. 387-89, 411-12 In late July, after the German forces had abandoned their offensive at Kursk, 69th Army, including the 305th, was transferred to Steppe Front. On August 3, Voronezh and Steppe Fronts launched the Belgorod-Bogodukhov Offensive Operation, and on August 5 the division distinguished itself in the final liberation of Belgorod,Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p. 115 being the first Red Army unit to break into its western outskirts, while the 89th Guards Rifle Division was simultaneously breaking into the east; between them they mopped up the German remnants within 24 hours.Zamulin, p. 411 For this it received the name of that city as an honorific: In 1963, then-Major General Vasilev was awarded the title \\"Honorary citizen of Belgorod\\" by the city's Council of People's Deputies.Zamulin, p. 411 In September, the 69th Army was removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, and while in reserves the 305th was assigned to 74th Rifle Corps of 1st Guards Army. This army was moved to 1st Ukrainian Front in November, but in December the entire 74th Rifle Corps was shifted to 38th Army.http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/944RLAA.pdf , p. 2 The division remained in that Army for the duration. On March 23, 1944, the 305th was one of five rifle divisions given credit for the liberation of Vinnytsia, and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In May the division left 74th Corps to be reassigned at various times to each of the other rifle corps in 38th Army. In November 1944, the 38th Army was transferred to 4th Ukrainian Front. On February 19, 1945, the 305th was recognized for it role in the liberation of Wadowice and other nearby towns with the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. The division ended hostilities in the vicinity of Prague.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 115 At this time, the men and women of the division proudly boasted the distinguished title of 305th Rifle, Belgorod, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov, Order of Kutuzov Division.
