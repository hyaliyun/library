She received the State Department Award for Heroism in 1997, after helping to evacuate several thousand people during the civil war in Sierra Leone. She is most noted for having been one of three State Department officials to publicly resign in direct protest of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Wright was also a passenger on the Challenger 1, which along with the Mavi Marmara, was part of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla. Early life Wright grew up in Bentonville, Arkansas, in what she referred to as \\"just a normal childhood\\". She attended the University of Arkansas where she was recruited in the U.S. Army. Wright earned a master's and J.D. degrees, while she worked for the U.S. Army. Her J.D.degree comes from the University of Arkansas and her master's degree in national security affairs is from the U.S. Naval War College. U.S. Army Wright earned a master's degree in National Security Affairs from the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island and later participated in reconstruction efforts after U.S. military actions in Grenada and Somalia. Wright went on to serve 13 years in active duty in the U.S. Army, and 16 years in the Army Reserves, rising to the rank of colonel. She was placed in the Retired Ready Reserve, meaning the President could call her back to active duty in a time of need. U.S. State Department In 1987, Wright went to work for the Foreign Service within the U.S. State Department. Over the course of her State Department career, Wright served as Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. embassies in Afghanistan (which she helped open following the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, an assignment she volunteered for), Sierra Leone (an embassy which she helped close and then reopen again), Micronesia and Mongolia, and also served at U.S. embassies in Uzbekistan (which she helped open), Kyrgyzstan, Grenada, and Nicaragua. Wright's eventual resignation was not the first time she had spoken out against policy. In an interview, Wright said that she spoke out against United Nations bombing tactics waged in Somalia in the effort to kill rebel leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Wright also said that she repeatedly disagreed with policy on multiple occasions but continued her work at the State Department. =Resignation= Wright submitted her resignation letter to then U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on March 19, 2003, the day before the onset of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Her letter was published on the internet the following day. In her resignation letter, Wright listed four reasons she could no longer work for the U.S. government under the Bush administration: * The decision to invade Iraq without the blessing of the U.N. Security Council * The \\"lack of effort\\" in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process * The \\"lack of policy\\" in regard to North Korea * The curtailment of civil liberties within the United States. Wright was the third of three State Department officials to retire from service in protest in the month prior to the invasion of Iraq, the other two being Brady Kiesling and John H. Brown. Wright says that she did not know the other two, and had not read their resignation letters at the time she submitted her own. Peace activism Protesting with Code Pink in 2006.

It was the first national stage of Finland.  History  The first theatre in Helsinki, Engels Teater, was completed in 1827. The wooden building designed by architect Carl Ludvig Engel was located in the corner of Mikaelsgatan and Esplanaden. At the time the theatre was opened it had no permanent actors and many of the actors who performed in the theatre during that time were en route to Saint Petersburg. The theatre designed by Engel soon became too small as the interest in theatre grew rapidly among the citizens of Helsinki. The new theatre building was opened on 28 November 1860. The new building, which was designed by Georg Theodor von Chiewitz, was built on Skillnaden, on the same site as the current Svenska Teatern. The first play performed in the new theatre was Princessan av Cypern by Zacharias Topelius and Fredrik Pacius. The first actors of the theatre were from the group of Pierre Deland. The group performed in the theatre in 1860‚Äì1861. The language was initially Swedish, but Finnish language was soon launched on stage by the Swedish actress Hedvig Raa- Winterhjelm. Only three years after the new theatre building was completed it was destroyed in a fire in 1863. The building was soon rebuilt, in the Neoclassical style, and the theatre re-opened its doors in 1866. This time the architect was Nicholas Benois from Russia. The theatre carried the name Nya Teatern (New Theatre) until the year 1887, when a Finnish theatre was opened in Helsinki. Since 1887 the name of the theatre has been Svenska Teatern. The building of Svenska Teatern was renovated in 1935 by architects Eero Saarinen and Jarl Eklund. The richly decorated facade of the building was replaced with a new facade representing functionalism. In the beginning of the 20th century, the directors of the theatre were mainly Swedish and many of the actors came from Sweden. In 1915, it was decided that theatre was to become a national stage for the Finland-Swedish theatre. Already in 1908, a new theatre school was founded by the theatre. Many pieces of incidental music by Jean Sibelius had their premiere in the theatre, including the initial version of Finlandia in November 1899.

Characteristics of anemonefish  Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes that, in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators and parasites. Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. Color variations occur between species, most commonly according to distribution, but also based on sex, age, and host anemone. Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. In a group of clownfish, a strict dominance hierarchy exists. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning they develop into males first, and when they mature, become females. Description Adults are a dark-brown to black color with two white bars with black edging encircling the body. The caudal fin is white with other fins orange. They have 10-11 dorsal spines, two anal spines, 15-17 dorsal soft rays, and 15-17 anal soft rays.

The only large city it passes through is Amarillo, where it meets the north end of Interstate 27. History Before the U.S. Route system, this system of interconnected highway from New Mexico to Oklahoma was part of the Texas highway system and a portion of the Ozark Trails which closely paralleled the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway. When the United States Numbered Highway system was introduced in 1926, Route 66 across the Texas Panhandle was designated along existing roads in the Texas highway network. The entire route was paved by 1938. There have been various realignments, including one in 1959 to allow expansion of the Amarillo Air Force Base. In 1956, the Interstate Highway Act designated US 66 through Texas as a section of highway eligible for limited access upgrades. During the next 20 years, most of the highway was upgraded in place, to keep construction costs low. With the limited access of the Interstates, towns on the highway had to be bypassed. Most towns requested to remain as close to the new highway as possible to minimize tourism losses. Bypassed towns included Glenrio, Adrian, Vega, Conway, Groom, Jericho, Alanreed, McLean, and Shamrock. A new routing along the south end of downtown Amarillo was also built, connecting with the already-built expressway leading south from downtown toward Canyon. In 1985, the entire designation of U.S. Route 66 was removed as the entire route had been displaced by Interstate 40. Route description At grade intersection on Interstate 40 near mile marker 8 in far west Texas. I-40 in Texas is one of a few Interstate Highways with at-grade intersections. The westernmost part of I-40 in Texas, near the New Mexico border, lacks the frontage roads typical to Texas freeways, and several driveways for ranches directly intersect the main lanes of I-40, in violation of Interstate standards. The entirety of Interstate 40 in Texas is located in the panhandle. Interstate 40 enters Texas from New Mexico just north of Glenrio. The highway's first exit, exit 0, is for BL I-40-A, which serves the town of Glenrio. I-40 briefly runs through Deaf Smith County before entering Oldham County. The interstate gains frontage roads between exits 15 and 18 and turns from a northeast direction into a straight east direction. I-40 bypasses the town of Adrian before turning southeast. I-40 next bypasses the town of Vega, where it meets with US 385 at exit 36. The interstate briefly runs in an east direction through the town of Wildorado before turning back to the southeast. I-40 has a mostly rural route before becoming more suburban in Bushland, with housing developments becoming visible from the highway. The interstate passes by Cadillac Ranch before the Hope Road interchange and enters the city limits of Amarillo just west of Loop 335. I-40 expands from four lanes to six at Loop 335 and runs through a heavily developed area of the city. Near downtown, the highway serves as the northern terminus for Interstate 27 at a turbine interchange and begins an overlap with US 287. I-40 runs through eastern Amarillo, passing by the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame and The Big Texan Steak Ranch. Development along the route begins to lessen after S. Eastern Street as the highway passes near Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport. US 287 leaves I-40 at exit 78 as the interstate leaves the city limits of Amarillo. The highway runs primarily through rural farm land after leaving the city and enters the town of Groom, passing near a 19‚Äìstory cross and a leaning water tower. East of Groom, I-40 has an overlap with SH 70 between exits 121 and 124. After the overlap with SH 70 ends, the terrain along the interstate begins to change from flat plains to a rolling canyon ridge with an observation point near Alanreed. I-40 returns to flatland again after the town of McLean and bypasses the town of Shamrock before entering Oklahoma near Texola. Exit list Business routes and old alignments right I-40 has seven business routes in Texas, all of which are old alignments of US 66. A number of other old alignments of US 66 are also present; most are marked on guide signs on I-40. Business Interstate Highway 40-A (formerly Spur 504) is a Business Spur that runs from I-40 at Glenrio, just east of the New Mexico state line, southwest to the border. In New Mexico, the road forks - the later paved alignment (c. 1952) has been cut by Interstate 40, and the earlier alignment west to San Jon is now a dirt road that had been paved when it was US 66 prior to 1952 but the paving was later removed by Quay County, NM commissioners due to high maintenance costs and low traffic volumes.

The Chanute Flight Test Award presentation occurs biennially (odd-numbered years) at the AIAA Aviation and Aeronautics Forum.The Chanute Flight Test Award is presented to recognize significant lifetime achievements in the advancement of the art, science, and technology of flight test engineering. Self taught Chanute Octave Chanute, 1832-1910, was born in France and became a naturalized American. He was a self-taught engineer. He designed the first railroad bridge over the Missouri River and the Union Stock Yards in Chicago (IL) as well as those in Kansas City (MO). Octave Chanute was a pioneer aeronautical engineer and experimenter, and was a friend and adviser to the Wright Brothers. Aeronautical pioneer Chanute waged a long campaign to encourage the invention of the airplane. He collected information from every possible source and gave it to anyone who asked. He published a compendium of aviation information in 1894. In 1896 he commissioned several aircraft to be built. The Katydid had multiple wings that could be attached variously about the fuselage for ease of experimentation. Chanute's biplane glider (1896) with \\"two arched wings held rigidly together by vertical struts and diagonal wire bracing\\" (the principle of the Pratt truss used in the railroad bridges which Chanute constructed) served as a prototype design for subsequent airplanes.

Route description The original US 66 followed an east-west line across the Texas Panhandle from Glenrio, New Mexico and Texas to Texola, Oklahoma. When Interstate 40 (I-40) was constructed most of the highway was upgraded in place, reducing construction costs and keeping existing towns close to the new highway to minimize tourism losses. Bypassed towns included Glenrio, Adrian, Vega, Conway, Groom, Jericho, Alanreed, McLean, and Shamrock; US 66 in each is retained as a business loop or spur of I-40. Outside of the towns, US 66 is typically retained as a frontage road for I-40. Route 66 originally crossed from New Mexico into Texas at Glenrio, an unincorporated community founded in 1903 as a Rock Island Railroad siding. During Route 66's heyday, Glenrio's caf√©s, filling stations and businesses such as the First/Last Motel in Texas served travellers on the highway; after the road was bypassed in 1973, Glenrio became a ghost town. Adrian (pop. 149) bills itself as the geographic \\"Midpoint of Route 66\\". Flo of Flo's V-8 Diner in Pixar's Cars is based on Fran Houser (who owned the Midpoint Caf√© but has since semi-retired); the Mia and Tia characters are based on two sisters at the Midpoint Caf√©. In Vega, Texas, the 1947 Vega Court remains in operation as a historic motel. Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo Amarillo is the only major city on the Texas portion of US 66; its 6th Street Historic District includes a dozen buildings incorporating elements of Spanish Revival, Art Deco, and Art Moderne design including homes, service stations, a historic fire hall and a church. The Cadillac Ranch inspired the Cadillac Range mountains in Cars while the Tex Dinoco character adopts the appearance of the stretched, longhorn Cadillac vehicles at Amarillo's Big Texan Steak Ranch. The Ranchotel, a tourist court built in 1940 and designed architecturally to resemble a Texas ranch, was one of sixty-eight Route 66 lodgings operating in Amarillo by 1953. The building still stands in good condition but is now used as apartments. Eastbound alignments out of include one that parallels I-40 (where one can find the Steak Ranch), while another is along I-40 business, multiplexed with US Route 60 for several miles out of town. The original alignment was probably along 8th Avenue, but that alignment has been interrupted by Amarillo International Airport. In Conway a portion of Route 66 from State Highway 207 (SH 207) to I-40 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Conway is home to The Bug Farm (with five VW Beetles buried nose down) and a trading post; the Triangle Motel is being restored after years of resting closed, neglected and abandoned. In Groom, Texas a leaning water tower stands empty, originally placed as an advertisement for a truck stop which burned years ago. A large crucifix serves as a local landmark. In McLean the McLean Commercial Historic District includes one of the first Phillips Petroleum stations in Texas (1929, now restored). Also in McLean is the Devils Rope Barbed Wire Museum, the Avalon Theatre and the Cactus Inn Motel. Shamrock has restored the Tower Station and U-Drop Inn Caf√© as a visitor centre; the Tower Station's distinctive architecture appears as Ramone's body shop in Cars. A Pioneer West Museum on two floors of the former Reynolds Hotel highlights a diversity of West Texas exhibits and the Route 66 Bridge over the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railroad is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History First/Last Motel in Texas, Glenrio Before the U.S. Route system, this route was a system of interconnected highways from New Mexico to Oklahoma, considered a part of the Texas highway system from New Mexico to Amarillo and a portion of the Ozark Trails. In Amarillo, the Ozark route split off to a more southerly route, while general low-grade roads continued east. This entire route closely paralleled the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway. Most construction through the Panhandle was slow, and remained low-grade roads through most of the 1920s. In 1926, the United States Numbered Highway system was introduced, and the route across the Texas Panhandle was given the number of 66. It was designated along already created roads in the Texas highway network. Large portions of the highway remained earthen roads until the entire route was completely paved in 1938. A few realignments were made to the original route. A new routing on the east side of Amarillo was completed in 1959 to make way for the expansion of the Amarillo Air Force Base, while the rest of the route through Amarillo was rebuilt on the north side of downtown. Major intersections Special route Business US 66, a business loop in Amarillo, was the only special route of US 66 in Texas.

He was sometimes credited as Oliver English and Clive McClean. McLean earned a qualification in graphic design in 1963 from Bradford College of Art. For a time, he was a band manager for Cat Stevens. He began photographing hippies and groupies for men's magazines and eventually did the first layout for Club. While doing photography for Playboy in the 1960s, he was approached by Bob Guccione to come and work for him at Penthouse. He met Larry Flynt in 1976 through photographer James Baes. Flynt was so impressed with McLean that he doubled the salary Guccione was paying him and brought him to the United States to begin a twenty-nine-year working relationship with Flynt. McLean appeared in the 2000 PBS Frontline documentary on the industry called \\"American Porn\\". He was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2001. He received the \\"Best Vignette\\" Award at the 2004 AVN Awards, and, that same year, American Movie Classics aired \\"The AMC Project: I Want to Be Clive McClean\\". McLean married model/makeup artist, Erica, in 1994. Together, they created and worked on the Barely Legal and Hot Showers franchises. His first wife was the model Stephanie McLean. He had a son from that marriage named Roman. McLean and his wife lived in the Hollywood Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, and they were active in setting up a park for the neighborhood dogs called Pinehurst Park. The actor Nick Brendan (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was also involved in this activity. Well regarded in the industry, he once shared studio space with fellow photographer Herb Ritts.

Most credible international sources give the credit of the invention of the cyclotron to American physicist and Nobel Laureate Ernest Orlando Lawrence, who invented the cyclotron during the spring of 1929 and built the first operational cyclotron in 1930 while at the University of California, Berkeley. In November 1939, Ernest O. Lawrence was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the cyclotron and its applications. In his main work, \\"Fizica teoretica\\" (Bucuresti, 1957, vol.

The paper registered the study as of May 6, 1929, but it was not printed because the editors missed the topic of the study and erroneously thought that it dealt with particle accelerators, a problem already solved in 1928 by Norwegian physicist Rolf Wider√∂e.

Opened in 1971, it has hosted presidents, prime ministers and celebrities. It is known as the \\"most bombed hotel in Europe\\" and the \\"most bombed hotel in the world\\" after having suffered 36 bomb attacks during the Troubles. Features As of late 2008, and following major refurbishment, the hotel has 272 bedrooms including 92 executive suites. On the ground floor there is the lobby bar and a causerie restaurant; on the first floor is the Piano Bar lounge. The hotel also has a conference and exhibition centre, various conference and banqueting suites, as well as a 12th-floor penthouse suite. History The Europa Hotel was constructed by Grand Metropolitan and designed by architects Sydney Kaye, Eric Firkin & Partners. It opened in July 1971.https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and- style/people/life-goes-on-at-the-most-bombed-hotel-in-the-world-1.2901861 It was built on the site of the former Great Northern Railway station and stands 51 metres high. During The Troubles, the hotel, where most journalists covering the Troubles stayed, was known as Europe‚Äôs most bombed hotel, earning the name \\"the Hardboard Hotel\\". Grand Met bought the Inter-Continental Hotels chain in 1981 and placed the Europa in their Forum hotels division. They renamed the hotel the Forum Hotel Belfast in February 1983. When the hotel was sold to The Emerald Group in October 1986, it regained its original name.http://www.futurebelfast.com/property/europa-hotel/ The hotel was blown up by the Provisional IRA in 1993 and damaged so badly that it sold for only ¬£4.4M. The Europa Hotel became part of the Hastings Hotels group on 3 August 1993, whereupon it was announced that it would close for the first time in its 22-year history to allow for major refurbishment. Following an ¬£8m investment, the hotel reopened in February 1994. Its first official event was the Flax Trust Ball, a gala evening for 500 local and international dignitaries. US President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton stayed in the hotel in November 1995; the suite used by the Clintons was subsequently renamed the Clinton Suite. The presidential entourage booked 110 rooms at the hotel. Started in early 2008, an extension to the hotel increased the height of a rear wing by seven floors, to twelve floors, and increased bedrooms from 240 to 272. The extension was designed by Robinson Patterson Partnership, now RPP Architects and was completed late in 2008.

His work is a re-creation, somewhere between realism and fantasy, of the mythical past of the old town of Mequinenza -now submerged beneath the waters of the river Ebro-. Considered one of the most important Catalan authors of his time, he received various prizes for his work, among them the Premio Ciutat de Barcelona and the Premio Nacional de la Cr√≠tica in 1989 for Cam√≠ de sirga (The Towpath) and the Creu de Sant Jordi, awarded by the Generalitat de Catalunya in 2001. In 2004--a few months before his death-- he received the Premio de las Letras Aragonesas. Moncada is one of the most translated authors of Catalan literature. Cam√≠ de sirga has been translated into fifteen languages, among them Japanese and Vietnamese. He also translated into Catalan many Spanish, French, and English works of authors such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Jules Verne, and Boris Vian. On July 9, 2005, he returned to Mequinenza (in Catalan, Mequinensa), where he was awarded the title of \\"favorite son.\\" He died on June 13, 2005 from cancer. His ashes were scattered in the noble house of old Mequinenza, now inundated by the Ribarroja reservoir, where he was born and where his works are set, under the watchful eye of his mother, his siblings -Rosa Mari and Albert-, his brother-in-law and nephew, and the neighbors of Mequinenza. Works Novels * Cam√≠ de sirga (The Towpath) (1988) ::The novel tells the story of a town situated at the confluence of two great rivers, the Ebro and the Segre, through the memories of its inhabitants. This avalanche of memories piles up until the 20th century, and is provoked by the construction of a reservoir and the imminent flooding of the town. The book also contains some reflections about history, memory, fiction and about the lies they all involve. The general tone is nostalgic, without being bitter, but some of the personalities and situations are also comic. It evokes: ::- the hypocrisy and cruelty of human relations in a town in which everyone knows everybody ::- the influence of history -the First World War in Europe and the Spanish Civil War- on the history of the town, ::- the economic system at work in the town and the Ebro valley. * La galeria de les est√†tues (The Statue Gallery) (1992) ::Unlike the other two novels, La galeria de les est√†tues is set mainly in the fictional town of Torrelloba rather than in Mequinenza. It relates the tragic story of Dalmau Campells and his family during the tension and repression of Francoist Spain. * Estremida mem√≤ria (Shaken Memory) (1997) ::This novel revolves around events that shook the community of Mequinenza in 1877, when four of the townspeople were executed for murder and robbery. More than a hundred years later, the community is still wounded by the legacy of what happened, as becomes clear when a writer finds a report of the events written at the time by a local court scribe. As he investigates further in order to write a book about what happened, he finds that he has disturbed the past and angered some of the present-day residents of Mequinenza who would rather have left the episode safely buried in the past.

It is located at the point where the Pawtuxet River flows into the Providence River and Narragansett Bay.  History  Pawtuxet means \\"Little Falls\\" in the Narragansett language, and this area was originally occupied by the Sononoce Pawtuxet tribe, part of the larger Narragansett Indian tribe. In 1638, Rhode Island founder Roger Williams purchased the property extending south from Providence to the Pawtuxet River. Shortly after, his followers William Arnold, William Harris, William Carpenter, and Zachariah Rhodes settled along the fertile meadows of the Pawtuxet. Meanwhile, Samuel Gorton purchased the land south of the Pawtuxet River and became the founder of Warwick.The history of Warwick, Rhode Island, from its settlement in 1642. Oliver Payson Fuller (1875). Early 18th century inhabitants took advantage of the power of the Pawtuxet River by constructing various mills, and took advantage of its excellent harbor by building one of America's premier shipping ports. The Pawtuxet Village Historic District boasts dozens of preserved Colonial structures among its scenic blend of homes and buildings. The mouth of the Pawtuxet River was a strategic location to settle, and gave boats a safe harbor and the village considerable importance in the triangular trade of the day, and shipyards for the coastal and West Indies trade were located here. It was here in 1772 where Rhode Island patriots took the first organized military action towards independence by attacking and burning the hated British revenue schooner . This was America's \\"First Blow for Freedom\\", known as the Gaspee Affair, and led directly to the establishment of permanent Committees of Correspondence, unifying the individual colonies, and starting the process of the American Revolution. The cities of Cranston and Warwick celebrate this historic role of Pawtuxet Village by hosting the annual Gaspee Days Parade each June. During the early 19th century, Christopher and William Rhodes formed the textile manufacturing firm which controlled the prosperity and swayed the destiny of Pawtuxet for more than half a century. It changed from a shipping port to a mill village with textile mills at either end of the Pawtuxet Falls. Pawtuxet shops and businesses of the 19th century may be seen on old advertising maps from about 1862-1870.http://pawtuxet.com/historichomes.htm In the late 19th century, the Rhodes family developed one of Rhode Island's top attractions called the Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet casino, dance hall, and canoe center.

In 1905, Vigeland traveled to Italy under a scholarship to study frescoes, a journey that also took him to Egypt and Jerusalem. In 1909, Vigeland was commissioned to decorate frescoes, stained glass and lighting equipment for the first Norwegian Crematorium (Det gamle kapell). The same year he was invited to participate in the competition for the decoration of fresco paintings and stained glass in the new assembly hall at the University of Oslo. Mostly known for his paintings, Vigeland also produced frescos, stained glass and sculptures. Noteworthy sculptures include The Virgin and the Unicorn, installed in Nyg√•rdsparken in Bergen. Many of his designs are inspired by Christianity, and he decorated the interior of a number of churches principally in Norway. Noteworthy were the design of the interiors, from the pulpit and altar to light fixtures and other decor, in Bryn Church in B√¶rum, (1911‚Äì14) and the mosaics and stained glass at Gjerpen Church at Skien (1919‚Äì21). Other notable example would include the chandeliers and wall lamps in the choir and the ship in the Stavanger Cathedral, the stained glass in the √Örhus Cathedral, the stained glass in Lund Cathedral and stained glass of Fredrikstad Cathedral in the Diocese of Borg. From 1919-22, he ran a school for stained glass art at his studio at Slemdal. In the 1920s he was at the height of his fame, having conducted a series of successful missions abroad. Vigeland was acquainted with Swedish archbishop Nathan S√∂derblom and through this connection he was introduced to the . Particularly extensive and prestigious was his work with glass paintings at Oscar's Church in Stockholm. Tomba Emmanuelle Vigeland made of his mausoleum (Tomba Emmanuelle) his magnum opus. His mausoleum, which doubles as a museum, is located in Oslo. It is shaped like a small windowless church, which has overwhelming acoustics that make speaking out loud almost impossible. The inside walls and roof are covered in a giant fresco, Vita, depicting human life, love and death. Several sculptures of women giving birth adorn the floor. The entry to the mausoleum is very low and the urn containing the ashes of the artist is in a niche above the entry, thus forcing all visitors to bow to him when exiting. It is rumoured that Emanuel was annoyed by always being in the shadow of his better known brother Gustav Vigeland and that this gesture of morbid humour was his posthumous revenge. In 1958, the mausoleum was opened to the public. It is run by the private foundation Emanuel Vigeland Museum. The amazing acoustics of the mausoleum can be heard in recordings by various artists: *American folk artist Jay Brannan, who was allowed a private visit during which he was videotaped singing his composition, Death Waltz. *Swedish/German group Mattimatti *Danish black metal musician Myrkur, who recorded the live acoustic album Mausoleum (2016) there, featuring The Norwegian Girls Choir. *Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq filmed the music video for her song Aorta inside Tomba Emmanuelle. *Norwegian traditional singer Unni L√∏vlid ‚Äì Vita, a solo vocal recording, Helio Records, 2005 *vocal ensemble Kristin Bolstad + Stemmeklang, a cappella recording, 2L Records, 2019 Personal life In 1902, Emanuel Vigeland married Valborg Kristine Madsen (1879‚Äì1951). Their children were Maria Vigeland (1903‚Äì1983), (1904‚Äì1968), and Imm Vigeland (born 1917). He was a grandfather of goldsmith Tone Vigeland.

Pettifer first attracted the talent scouts when he was awarded the Larke Medal for his outstanding performance during the Australian Vic Country's Under 18 team at the 2000 AFL Under 18 Championships. Later in the 2000 National AFL Draft Kayne Pettifer was selected by the Richmond Football Club at number 9 overall, which was unexpected for such a short forward. For the next four years Kayne Pettifer had sporadic form rarely playing more than nine games a year. In 2005, however, Kayne Pettifer played a very different role. He lined up to play in all 22 games and was the Tigers third highest goal kicker (31). He also led the side for inside 50's cementing himself into Richmond's top 22. In 2006, he established himself as a high flyer, capable of taking a spectacular mark, with an unprecedented three consecutive winning nominations for the Mark of the Year. He finished top 5 in Richmond's Best and Fairest in 2006 and has continued his form into 2007. In 2008, he had a bad start to the season, being suspended. It got worse, when he required a full knee reconstruction. This opened the door for other players to take his position. He was a chance to be delisted but coach Terry Wallace kept on him on for the 2009 season. 2009 was another horror year. He managed only four games for the season and he badly injured his knee once again in a VFL match. His father died in a car crash in August. Then Richmond delisted Pettifer on 30 October. Pettifer returned to his home town club, Kyabram, for the 2010 season. He was one of the leagues leading goal kickers. In 2011 he played half a season in the WAFL for East Perth before returning to Victoria and playing in former teammate Troy Simmonds Montrose side in the Eastern Football League. Pettifer then became a high-profile recruit for Montmorency in the Northern Football League for season 2012. Pettifer made his Montmorency debut on 14 April 2012 with a nine-goal haul in the Magpies win over Macleod. Nowadays Pettifer plays for the Kyabram bombers in the Goulburn valley league, a long way from playing in front of 88,000 fans at Etihad stadium (capacity 54,000). They were reportedly swinging from the rafters. He is now a licensed bricklayer that signs off on bricklaying jobs throughout NSW. He also owns an up-and-coming clothing brand called contractor which specialise in gloves and hats.

The rulers of Independent Tripura were the first to present and perform drama in Tripura. Though in the beginning the presentations of yatras (jatras) were limited to the Royal Compound, in course of time it came out of the royal compound and mass people also began to enjoy it and join it. History Having the basic foundation to perform in the open-air theatre, Kokborok-speaking people came to compose and present drama in their language during the period of the Tripura Janasiksha Samiti Movement (1945-late 1950s). \\"Agiya Chalo\\" written by Sudhanya Debbarma was the first drama in Kokborok. After \\"Agiye Chalo\\" \\"Lamani Homchang\\" was presented in 1973 by the Kokborok Sahitya Sabha, written and directed by Alindab Tripura. In the middle 1970s many groups came to present theatre using modern style, sound and music, etc. \\"Thwi Phuta\\" was one of the popular ones during this time, as also \\"Somaj Kiphildi\\" and \\"Yamorok\\". Hemanta Jamatia, a renowned musician and actor became very popular at this time due to his acting in \\"Thwi Phuta\\" and has also been awarded by the Sahitya Academy. Modern drama \\"Nobar Domsani Kothoma\\" composed by Nanda Kumar Debbarma was presented by Kokborok Sahitya Sabha in 1983.

He was born in Rhinebeck, New York in 1797 and came to the Niagara District with his family around 1810. He served with the local militia during the War of 1812. After the war, he settled at St. Catharines and taught school there. He trained as a surveyor and became a deputy land surveyor for the province in 1821. He undertook a number of projects, including laying out a plan for the expanding community at St. Catharines and helping prepare estimates for a canal system on the Saint Lawrence River. He was involved in an unsuccessful contract to complete a section of the Rideau Canal near the current site of Smiths Falls in 1827. In 1829, he opened a general store and wharf at St. Catherines with his brother- in-law; he also became involved in a distillery and a gristmill. He became a justice of the peace in the Niagara District in 1832. In 1834, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in the 2nd riding of Lincoln; he was reelected in 1836. Rykert supported the sale of the clergy reserves with the funds raised going to fund public works and schools as well as the needs of all religious groups represented in the province. He opposed the union of Upper and Lower Canada and responsible government as described in Lord Durham's report. He was defeated by William Hamilton Merritt, a former political ally, in a bid for a seat in the legislative assembly for the united province. In 1843, he became the agent in St. Catharines for the Commercial Bank of the Midland District. In 1845, he became a member of the police board for the town; he was elected to the town council in 1855 and served as reeve from 1856 to 1857. He also served as agent for a number of companies in the region and was president of the Port Dalhousie and Thorold Railway. He died in St Catharines in 1857 of a chest cancer. His son John Charles later became a member of the House of Commons of Canada.

It reached #15 on the UK album chart. This is a reconstituted Hawkwind with Brock, Bainbridge and King emerging from the dissolved Hawklords, joined by lead guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton who had played on the debut album Hawkwind and keyboardist Tim Blake who was a long-standing friend of the band and had played on Gong's Radio Gnome trilogy. This band embarked upon a UK Winter 1979 tour despite not having a record deal nor any product to promote, recording one of the shows. Originally the band \\"didn't think the Oxford gig was very good, but we listened to the mixing-desk tape and were really surprised. So we mixed the master tape and got a deal with Bronze. If we hadn't got that deal, we'd probably have split up - we couldn't have carried on on our own.\\"Orbit 4 (June 1983): Huw Lloyd-Langton interview Manager Douglas Smith secured a two-album deal with Bronze Records, even if Gerry Bron confessed \\"I don't think we would have signed Hawkwind if it weren't for Motorhead, I can't say I was that interested... Once you run a record label and you're employing people, you have to make good commercial decisions - you can't turn away business, even if the business isn't what you particularly want to do\\".DMME.NET - Classic Rock and Beyond - Interview with Gerry Bron, November 2004 The music is more energetic and aggressive than the previous albums released on Charisma Records and the album benefited in the rise in popularity of NWOBHM at the time. \\"Shot Down in the Night\\" had been written by Hawklords keyboardist Steve Swindells for single release, but he departed during the year to record a solo album. The single was backed by the non-album cut \\"Urban Guerrilla\\" and reached #59 on the UK singles chart. Swindells also released a studio version of this track as a single and on his Fresh Blood album which he recorded with King, Lloyd-Langton and Nic Potter. \\"Lighthouse\\" is from Tim Blake's solo album New Jerusalem. \\"Silver Machine\\" explodes part way into the song and is suffixed with \\"Requiem\\" in Brock's attempt to kill it off, being sick of this 'hit single' he was expected to play every night.

During 1999, Brock issued a slew of archive recordings through Voiceprint Records to generate money to pay off an outstanding Inland Revenue tax bill. No permission from the other musicians was sought, although they did duly receive accounting and royalties once the outstanding bill was settled, leading to several members complaining about this activity, and former manager Douglas Smith commenting \\"I think it's wrong. As a human being and as a manager, I have to get the permission of all the artists involved before I would do a deal.\\" The Saga of Hawkwind, Carol Clerk, pp450 This recording is not professional, possibly being a mixing desk tape but probably an audience bootleg. The sound levels and frequency fluctuate throughout making this difficult listening despite a good band performance.Starfarer - CD Review It purports to be the full unexpurgated concert, but there are clearly edits, notably during \\"Brainstorm\\" at 5:08 into Brock playing \\"You Know You're Only Dreaming\\". Exactly why such a poor quality recording was used for this release is uncertain, as the Hawkwind Anthology full versions of \\"Shot Down in the Night\\" and \\"Urban Guerrilla\\" demonstrate there are superior recordings available. Nevertheless, this CD contains the only available live versions of \\"PXR5\\" and Tim Blake's \\"New Jerusalem\\".

Section 14 of the Act stipulates a number of privacy rights known as the Information Privacy Principles (IPPs). These principles apply to Australian Government and Australian Capital Territory agencies or private sector organizations contracted to these governments, as well as to organizations and small businesses who provide a health service.http://www.privacy.gov.au/business/health The principles govern when and how personal information can be collected by these government agencies. Information can only be collected if it is relevant to the agencies' functions. Upon this collection, that law mandates that Australians have the right to know why information about them is being acquired and who will see the information. Those in charge of storing the information have obligations to ensure such information is neither lost nor exploited. An Australian will also have the right to access the information unless this is specifically prohibited by law. 2000 amendments The Privacy Act was amended in 2000 to cover the private sector. Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act sets out a significantly different set of privacy principles, the National Privacy Principles (NPPs). These apply to private sector organizations (including not for profit organizations) with a turnover exceeding three million dollars, other than health service providers or traders in personal information. These principles extend to the transfer of personal information out of Australia. State legislation Privacy principles that are substantially the same as the NPPs are also included in the legislation applying to the public sectors of some Australian States and Territories, namely the Information Privacy Act 2000 (Victoria), Information Act 2002 (Northern Territory), Personal Information Protection Act 2004 (Tasmania), and the 'Health Records and Information Privacy Act' 2002 (New South Wales). Administration Australia's privacy principles, both IPPs and NPPs, depend upon the meaning of \\"personal information\\" (as defined in Privacy Act 1988 s6). This term has not yet been interpreted in a restrictive way as has been \\"personal data\\" in the UK Durant case.John Durant v Financial Services Authority [2003] EWCA Civ 1746, Case no: B2/2002/2636 http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/1746.html The Privacy Act creates an Office of the Privacy Commissioner and a Privacy CommissionerOffice of the Privacy Commissioner website in Australia. Section 36 of the Act states that Australians may appeal to this Commissioner if they feel their privacy rights have been compromised, unless the privacy was violated by an organization that has its own dispute resolution mechanisms under an approved Privacy Code. The Commissioner, who may decide to investigate complaints and in some cases must investigate, can under section 44 obtain relevant evidence from other people. There is no appeal to a Court or Tribunal against decisions of the Commissioner except in very limited circumstances. Section 45 of the Privacy Act allows the Commissioner to interview the people themselves, and the people might have to swear an oath to tell the truth. Anyone who fails to answer the Commissioner may be subject to a fine of up to $2,000 and/or year- long imprisonment (under section 65). Under section 64 of the Privacy Act, the Commissioner is also given immunity against any lawsuits that he or she might be subjected to for the carrying out of their duties. If the Commissioner will not hear a complaint, an Australian may receive legal assistance under section 63. If a complaint is taken to the Federal Court of Australia, in certain circumstances others may receive legal assistance. Even though the Privacy Act has been in force for nearly 20 years, there is as yet little case law interpreting it. The only significant Federal Court decision is Seven Network (Operations) Limited v Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance [2004] FCA 637, involving a dispute between a trade union and a media company, which confirmed that s98 of the Privacy Act did allow \\"any person\\" to seek an injunction to prevent breaches of the Act. The only recent High Court decision to consider privacy issues, ABC v Lenah 208 CLR 199, did not interpret the Privacy Act. Review of the Act The Australian Law Reform Commission completed an inquiry into the state of Australia's privacy laws in 2008. The Report entitled For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and PracticeALRC Report For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice ALRC Australia must rewrite privacy laws for the Information Age, 1 August 2008 recommended significant changes be made to the Privacy Act, as well as the introduction of a statutory cause of action for breach of privacy.ALRC List of Recommendations The Australian Government committed in October 2009 to implementing a large number of the recommendations that the Australian Law Reform Commission had made in its report.

He was educated as an engineer and, serving with distinction in senior staff and engineering positions through the First World War, was seven times mentioned in despatches. Early life and career Cecil Henry Foott was born on 16 January 1876 at Bourke, New South Wales, the son of a station owner, Thomas Wade Foott and his wife, the poet Mary Hannay (n√©e Black). He was educated at Brisbane Grammar School and Toowoomba Grammar School, and qualified as a mechanical engineer. In 1895, Foott was commissioned into the Queensland Militia Garrison Artillery as a second lieutenant. The following September he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Permanent Military Forces, in the Queensland Artillery. In July 1901 he was promoted to captain in the Royal Australian Artillery. In 1902 Foott transferred to the Royal Australian Engineers. After a year of training in England in 1908, he became Chief Engineer in Victoria in 1909. He was promoted to major on 1 August 1909, served as Director of Works from 1910 to 1911 and then as Director of Engineers from 1911‚Äì12. In 1912‚Äì13 he attended the Staff College, Camberley in England, and was still on duty in the England on the staff of Southern Command when the war broke out. First World War Being one of only six staff college graduates in the Army, this made Foott in demand for staff duties and on the outbreak of the First World War Major General William Bridges immediately requested him for the 1st Division staff as Deputy Assistant Adjutant General. This part of the division staff was concerned with personnel administration. Foott joined the staff in Egypt in January 1915. Foott was determined that the men should always be supplied properly, and made a point of letting the officers of the Lines of Communication, living palatially on board the Aragon, know exactly what he thought of them whenever they placed obstacles in his way. He remained in the post for two years. In France he found the logistics far more complex, but much better organised, and increasingly free of shortages, he was able to deliver there a quality of service that he had never been able to achieve at Gallipoli. On 23 July 1917 Foott became Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. Then on 17 March 1918 he became Chief Engineer of the Australian Corps. It was his first engineering post since before the war. Foott called conferences of his engineers and tried to build up a sense of esprit amongst the corps. Increasingly, the engineering effort was driven by corps, as the engineers attempted to keep the troops and supplies moving forwards. Post war After the war ended, Foott became Deputy Director of Repatriation, working under Lieutenant General Sir John Monash. Foott himself returned to Australia in November 1919. Foott became a colonel and honorary brigadier general in the Staff Corps. He served at first in the Quartermaster General's Branch at Army Headquarters. In 1926 he became Commandant of the 1st Military District in Queensland. Then in 1930 he became Commandant of the 3rd Military District and commander of the 4th Division in Victoria. In July 1931, Foott was transferred to the Reserve of Officers. He was placed on the Retired List in February 1936 as an honorary brigadier general. He died on 27 June 1942 and was buried at Berwick Cemetery.

Their eponymous genus is Halkieria , which has been found on almost every continent in Lower to Mid Cambrian deposits, forming a large component of the small shelly fossil assemblages. The best known species is Halkieria evangelista, from the North Greenland Sirius Passet Lagerst√§tte, in which complete specimens were collected on an expedition in 1989. The fossils were described by Simon Conway Morris and John Peel in a short paper in 1990 in the journal Nature. Later a more thorough description was undertaken in 1995 in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London and wider evolutionary implications were posed. The group is sometimes equated to Sachitida, although as originally envisaged, this group includes the wiwaxiids and is thus equivalent to the Halwaxiida. History of discovery Armor plates called \\"sclerites\\" had long been known as elements of the small shelly fossils, and detailed analysis showed that some of these belonged to the same animal and how they fitted together. The first articulated specimens of Halkieria evangelista, with all their hard parts together, were collected in 1989 from the Sirius Passet lagerst√§tte in Greenland, and were described in 1990 by Simon Conway Morris and John S. Peel. A short but free account is given at H. evangelista is used as a model for identifying and reconstructing as halkieriids other similar shells and sclerites; its epithet evangelista reflects its power to explain the Lower Cambrian fossil record. Description of the fossils =Features shared by Halkieria and Australohalkieria= Only armor-like sclerites of Australohalkieria have been found, and much of the analysis assumes that these animals were similar to Halkieria. However the sclerites are so similar that this assumption looks fairly safe. In both genera the sclerites are of the type called \\"coelosclerites\\", which have a mineralized shell around a space originally filled with organic tissue, and which show no evidence of growth by adding material round the outside. Both genera also have sclerites of three different shapes: \\"palmate\\", flat and shaped rather like a maple leaf, which are generally the smallest; \\"cultrate\\", flat but shaped like knife blades; and \\"siculate\\", which are about the same size as the cultrates but are spine-shaped and like rather squashed cylinders. In both Halkieria and Australohalkieria the palmate and cultrate sclerites have prominent ribs, and are fairly flat except for 90¬∞ bends at the bases, which indicate that they fitted snugly against the animals' bodies. The siculates mostly lack ribs and appear to have projected away from the body at angles between about 45¬∞ and 90¬∞. =Halkieria evangelista= The animals looked like slugs in chain mail - to long, bilaterally symmetric, flattened from top to bottom and unarmored on the bottom. Very near each end there is a shell plate with prominent growth lines rather like the growth rings of trees. The rest of the upper surface was covered with about 2,000 sclerites that overlapped each other like tiles and formed three zones with sclerites of different shapes: \\"palmates\\", shaped rather like maple leaves, ran along the center of the back between the shell plates; blade-shaped \\"cultrates\\" lay on either side of the palmates and pointing towards the middle of the upper surface; and slim, sickle-shaped \\"siculates\\" covered the outer edges. The sclerites bore a wide central cavity, and (at least in some specimens) finer lateral canals. As the animals grew, the shell plates grew by adding material to the outer edges. Individual sclerites stayed the same size; since the cultrate sclerites form a pattern that is constant in all fairly complete specimens, the old ones that were too small may have been shed and replaced by larger ones as the animals grew. The sclerites seem to have grown by basal secretion. There are traces of thin ribs between the sclerites and the skin. The shellplates and the sclerites were probably made of calcium carbonate originally; it has been suggested on the basis of how they were preserved that they may have been wholly organic, but this is less likely since fossils of non-calcified organisms are usually thin films while Halkeieria fossils are three-dimensional like those of trilobites and hyoliths - in fact several specimens show curvature in the horizontal plane, which suggests that the muscles associated with the sclerites were still present at the time of burial The sole was soft and probably muscular. Since Halkieria was unsuited to swimming and had no obvious adaptations for burrowing, it must have lived on the sea-floor, \\"walking\\" by making its muscular sole ripple. The backward- projecting siculate sclerites may have improved its grip by preventing it from slipping backwards. Some specimens have been found partially rolled up, rather like a pillbug, and in this position the cultrate sclerites projected outwards, which probably deterred predators. It is difficult to determine the functions of the cap-shaped shells at either end of the animal, as the sclerites appear to have offered adequate protection. Scars on the inner surface of the front shell may indicate that it provided an attachment for internal organs. In one specimen the rear shell appears to have rotated by about 45¬∞ before fossilization, which suggests there was a cavity underneath, which may have housed gills. Traces of a gut have been found in the rear halves of some fossils. Parts of one specimen have been interpreted as a radula, the toothed chitinous tongue that is the signature feature of molluscs, but in this specimen the edge of the \\"scleritome\\", i.e. coat of sclerites, is folded and the putative radula could be a group of dislocated siculate sclerites. =Australohalkieria superstes= The name of the most complete and abundant Australian find means \\"Southern Halkieria the Survivor\\" because it proves that halkieriids survived the end-Botomian extinction. The sclerites assigned to this species are convex on the upper surface and concave on the lower. They may also curve within their own plane, and they overlap so that the concave side of each is partly covered by the convex side of the next one. The internal cavity within Australohalkieria is more complicated than the simple tube in Halkieria; about half-way up the sclerite, the cylindrical tube splits into a pair of longitudinal canals, with the central canal flattening; the canals don't seem to be connected. The walls also have a different microscopic structure. In A. superstes the central canals of sclerites are flattened on their upper surfaces, and this produces a depression on the upper surface of the tip. The surface of this depression is not mineralized, which suggests the depression may have helped the animals' sense of smell by letting chemicals in the water penetrate the exposed skin. The phosphatic coating on sclerites of A. superstes has features that suggest they were originally covered by a thin organic skin. An outer organic layer has also been found on sclerites of the chancelloriids, sessile organisms that are thought to have looked rather like cacti. If halkieriids were early molluscs, the outer layers of the sclerites may have been similar to the periostracum of some modern molluscs. The sclerites of A. superstes have right- and left-handed variants which are equally abundant, which suggests that A. superstes was bilaterally symmetrical. All of the sclerites were tiny: the palmate ones ranged from to in length, and the cultrates from to . The siculates fall into two groups: those with a shallow S-curve at the base, which range from to in length, and often have a slight twist at the base; and those with a 45¬∞ and 90¬∞ bend at the base and are to long. Scleritomes of Early Cambrian halkieriids have many more palmate and cultrate than siculate sclerites. On the other hand, siculate sclerites of A. superstes are more abundant than either cultrate or palmate sclerites; in fact palmate sclerites are rare. Possibly some process after death removed many of the palmates and some of the cultrates, but it is more likely that in A. superstes the part of the scleritome, or \\"coat of mail\\", closest to the sea-bed was larger relative to the lateral and dorsal zones further up and towards the center. A. superstes sclerites are also about one- third the size of Early Cambrian halkieriid sclerites. Since the Georgina assemblage includes larger fossils and most Early Cambrian halkieriids are preserved by the same method, phosphatization, it is unlikely that preservational bias has produced an unrepresentative sample. Possible explanations for the small size of A. superstes sclerites include: the individual(s) represented in the Georgina assemblage were juveniles; their scleritomes were composed of many more sclerites than those of Early Cambrian halkieriids; or the species itself was relatively small. No shells that might be assigned to halkieriids have been found in the Georgina Basin. This does not prove that Australohalkieria lacked shells, as shells of Halkieria are rarely found. =Australohalkieria parva= This species, whose name means \\"Small Southern Halkieria\\", was first described in 1990. cited by Like A. superstes, its sclerites have undivided longitudinal canals and a very similar structure to their walls wall, but A. parva has sclerites whose central canals are not flattened. =Other halkieriid fossils from Australia= The other sclerites from the Georgina Basin are different enough to be excluded from Australohalkieria superstes, but are not sufficiently abundant to provide enough detail for them to be classified. One type is very similar to those of A.superstes, even having a two-pronged tip, but the middle canal is not flattened. The other has a flattened central canal and no longitudinal canals, and may represent an additional Middle Cambrian halkieriid genus, distinct from Australohalkieria and from the Early Cambrian Halkieria. =Siphogonuchitids= Siphogonuchitids have two sclerite morphs as well as their shell(s), thus may have had a simpler scleritome than Halkieria and its ilk, concordant with the sclerites' simpler internal anatomy. The genera Siphogonuchites, Dabashanites, Lopochites, and Maikhanella all seem to represent components of the Siphogonuchites animal. Sclerites of Drepanochites can be distinguished based on their aspect ratio. Maikhanella is shell formed of Siphogonuchites sclerites that are fused together with a calcified matrix. Juvenile shells appear not to incorporate sclerites. The central cavity of the Siphogonuchites sclerite is simple, with no lateral chambers attached. = Ninellids = The ninellids, typified by Ninella, are a Lower Cambrian group that had an even simpler scleritome, with only one sclerite type (although variation in the morphology of the sclerites is observed, and left- and right- sided sclerites exist). Their sclerites are hooked or scoop-like, and are very similar to halkieriid or siphonogunuchitid sclerites; they were hollow and calcareous and had a ridged upper surface. =Hippopharangites= Hippopharangites has sclerites with a broad central cavity and small pores opening through the shell wall, equivalent to the lateral chambers of other halkieriids (and the aesthete canals of Chitons?) This genus is the closest in form to Chancelloriid sclerites, and is thus used to support the union of halkieriids and chancelloriids as Coeloscleritophora. =Lomasulcachites= Lomasulcachites is a further genus known from sclerites alone. =Sachites= Sachites Meshkova 1969 is a genus that comprised spiny sclerites; many Sachites specimens are now referred to other halkieriid taxa. Although believed to be related to the halkieriids, a chancelloriid affinity has more recently been proposed. =Sinosachites= Sinosachites is a genus of 'halkieriid' known only from sclerites; these have internal chambers that are sub-perpendicular to the central canal, to which they are connected by narrow channels. The chambers are the same diameter, ~40 ¬µm, as the longitudinal canals in Australohalkieria; their greater number and arrangement as lateral rather than longitudinal bodies reflects the greater size of the Sinosachites sclerites, which measure about 1‚Äì2 mm in length. The sclerites are synonymous with Thambetolepis, which was originally described from Australia. Left-hand and right-hand sclerites exist, so the animal was bilaterally symmetrical; as in Halkieria, palmate, cultrate and siculate sclerite morphologies exist. =Oikozetetes= Oikozetetes is known only from two types of cap-shaped shell found in the Burgess Shale and dated to about . The two types are thought to be the front and rear shells of a halkieriid. They were probably calcareous while the organism was alive (although diagenesis sometimes replaces the original mineral with another, such as silica). It is thought to also have borne an armour coat consisting of biomineralised sclerites, like Halkieria. These are never found in direct association with the shells, but there are many biostratinomic processes which could account for this fact. The lower Cambrian taxon Ocruranus (=Eohalobia) is putatively equivalent to the shells of Oikozetetes and seemingly belonged to a halkieriid-type body, although an intermediate valve suggests a Palaeoloricate-like body form. Occurrence The only reasonably complete specimens, of Halkieria evangelista, were found in the Sirius Passet lagerst√§tte in Greenland. Fragments which are confidently classified as belonging to halkieriids have been found in China's Xinjiang province cited by and Australia's Georgina Basin, while shells of a possible halkieriid have been found in Canada's Burgess Shale. Halkieriid-like armor plates, called \\"sclerites\\" have been found in many other places as part of the small shelly fauna. The earliest known occurrences of Halkieriids sclerites, classified as Halkieria longa, date from the Purella antiqua Zone of the Upper Nemakit-Daldynian Stage in Siberia.M.A. Semikhatov (2008). \\"The Upper Precambrian.\\" In: \\"State of level of scrutiny of Precambrian and Phanerozoic stratigraphy of the Russia.

(in Russian) The mass extinction at the end of the Cambrian period's Botomian age was thought to have wiped out most of the small shellies, including the halkieriids, but in 2004 Halkieriid fossils classified as Australohalkieria were reported from Mid-Cambrian rocks of the Georgina Basin in Australia. It is not known why this clade would have survived while other halkieriid clades apparently died. It may be significant that the only archaeocyathans known to have survived the end-Botomian extinction also occur in Gondwana, the old super-continent that embraced South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica. cited by cited by Halkieriids and other small shelly fossils are typically, although not always, preserved in phosphate, which may or may not have been their original mineral composition. Preservation by a covering of phosphate only seems to have been common during the early Cambrian, becoming rarer with time as a result of increased disturbance of sea-floors by burrowing animals. Hence it is possible that halkieriids and other small shelly fossils were alive earlier than the earliest known fossils and later than the latest known fossils ‚Äî paleontologists call this kind of uncertainty the Signor‚ÄìLipps effect.

Phylogenetic position of Halkieria The evolutionary relationships of the halkieriids are a complex topic which is still being debated. Most of this debate is about their relationship to Wiwaxia and to the three major lophotrochozoan phyla ‚Äî molluscs, annelids and brachiopods. The question of their relationship to an apparently much more primitive Cambrian group, the chancelloriids is also significant and may raise some difficult questions. =Relationship to Molluscs, Annelids and Brachiopods= In 1995 Conway Morris and Peel presented a cladogram based both on the fossils' features and on early 1990s research in molecular phylogeny, which is the application of cladistic analysis to DNA and RNA: *The siphogonotuchids, a group found in Earliest Cambrian rocks, were the \\"sister\\" group to all the rest. These are known only from isolated fragments. *The earliest halkieriids were a \\"sister\\" group to the molluscs, in other words descendants of a fairly closely related common ancestor. This relationship, they said, was supported by the muscular foot that most researchers assumed halkieriids had. *Another halkieriid genus, Thambetolepis / Sinosachites, was a \\"great aunt\\" of annelids and Wiwaxia was an \\"aunt\\" of annelids. Their claim of a close relationship between halkieriids and Wiwaxia was based on both groups' having sclerites divided into three concentric zones. The close relationship of Wiwaxia to annelids was based on the similarities Butterfield (1990) found between Wiwaxia‚Äôs sclerites and the bristles of polychaete annelids. Canadia is a Burgess Shale fossil that is widely agreed to be a polychaete. *Halkieria evangelista, which Conway Morris had found in Greenland's Sirius Passet lagerst√§tte, was a \\"sister\\" group\\" to brachiopods, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the lophophore. Brachiopods have bristles that are similar to those of annelids and hence to Wiwaxia‚Äôs sclerites, and hence to halkieriid sclerites. A brachiopod affinity seemed plausible because brachiopods pass through a larval phase that resembles a halkieriid, and some isolated fossil shells thought to belong to halkieriids had a brachiopod-like microstructure. In 2003 Cohen, Holmer and Luter supported the halkieriid-brachiopod relationship, suggesting that brachiopods may have arisen from a halkieriid lineage that developed a shorter body and larger shells, and then folded itself and finally grew a stalk out of what used to be the back. Vinther and Nielsen (2005) proposed instead that Halkieria was a crown group mollusc, in other words more similar to modern molluscs that to annelids, brachiopods or any intermediate groups. They argued that: Halkieria‚Äôs sclerites resembled those of the modern solenogaster aplacophoran shell-less molluscs (see ), of some modern polyplacophoran molluscs, which have several shell plates, and of the Ordovician polyplacophoran Echinochiton; Halkieria‚Äôs shells are more similar to the shells of conchiferan molluscs, since shells of both of these groups show no trace of the canals and pores seen in polyplacophoran shell plates; the bristles of brachiopods and annelids are similar to each other but not to Halkieria‚Äôs sclerites. Caron, Scheltema, Schander and Rudkin (2006) also interpreted Halkieria as a crown group mollusc, with Wiwaxia and Odontogriphus as stem group molluscs, in other words \\"sister\\" and \\"aunt\\" of the crown group molluscs. Their main reason for regarding Halkieria as crown group molluscs is that both possessed armor mineralized with calcium carbonate. They treated Wiwaxia and Odontogriphus as stem group molluscs because in their opinion both possessed the distinctive molluscan radula, a chitonous toothed \\"tongue\\". Also in 2006, Conway Morris criticized Vinther and Nielsen's (2005) classification of Halkieria as a crown group mollusc, on the grounds that the growth of the spicules in the aplacophorans and polyplacophorans is not similar to the method of growth deduced for the complex halkieriid sclerites; in particular, he said, the hollow spines of various molluscs are not at all like the halkieriid sclerites with their complex internal channels. Conway Morris repeated his earlier conclusion that halkieriids were close to the ancestors of both molluscs and brachiopods. Butterfield (2006) accepted that Wiwaxia and Odontogriphus were closely related, but argued that they were stem-group polychaetes rather than stem-group molluscs. In his opinion the feeding apparatus of these organisms, which consisted of two or at most four rows of teeth, could not perform the functions of the \\"belt-like\\" molluscan radula with their numerous tooth-rows; the different tooth-rows in both Wiwaxia and Odontogriphus tooth-rows also have noticeably different shapes, while those of molluscan radulae are produced one after the other by the same group of \\"factory\\" cells and therefore are almost identical. He also regarded lines running across the middle region of Odontogriphus fossils as evidence of external segmentation, since the lines are evenly spaced and run exactly at right angles to the long axis of the body. As in his earlier papers, Butterfield emphasized the similarities of internal structure between Wiwaxia‚Äôs sclerites and the bristles of polychaetes, and the fact that polychaetes are the only modern organisms in which some of the bristles form a covering over the back. Conway Morris and Caron (2007) published the first description of Orthrozanclus reburrus. This resembled the halkieriids in having concentric bands of sclerites, although only two and not mineralized; and one shell at what was presumed to be the front and which was similar in shape to Halkieria‚Äôs front shell. It also had long spines rather like those of Wiwaxia. Conway Morris and Caron regarded this creature as evidence that the \\"halwaxiids\\" were a valid taxon and were monophyletic, in other words shared a common ancestor with each other and with no other organism. They published two cladograms, representing alternative hypotheses about the evolution of the lophotrochozoa, the lineage that includes molluscs, annelids and brachiopods: # This is the more likely, although it falls apart if the organisms' characteristics are changed even slightly: #*Kimberella and Odontogriphus are early, primitive molluscs, without sclerites or any kind of mineralized armor. #*Wiwaxia, the siphogonotuchids, Orthrozanclus and Halkieria from a side- branch of the mollusc family tree, which diverged in that order. This would mean that: Wiwaxia was the first of them to have sclerites, which were unmineralized; the siphogonotuchids were the first to have mineralized sclerites, although the scleritome was simpler; halkieriids then develop more complex scleritomes, while in Orthrozanclus the scleritome became unmineralized again and the rear shell vanished or became so small that it has not been seen in fossils. This hypothesis faces the difficulty that siphogonotuchids appear in earlier rocks and have simpler scleritomes than the other three groups. #*The annelids and brachiopods evolved from the other main branch of the family tree, which did not include the molluscs. # The alternative view is: #*Kimberella and Odontogriphus are early, primitive lophotrochozoans. #*The siphogonotuchids, Halkieria, Orthrozanclus and Wiwaxia form a group that is closer to the shared ancestor of annelids and brachiopods than it is to the molluscs. The siphogonotuchids are the first of the group to become distinctive, with two types of mineralized sclerites and a \\"shell\\" made of fused sclerites. Halkieriids had three types of sclerites and two one-piece shells. In Orthrozanclus the sclerites became unmineralized and in Wiwaxia the shells were lost. The network of internal cavities within sclerites of the halkieriid Sinosachites have been likened to the aesthete canals in polyplacophora, strengthening the case for a molluscan affinity. =Relationship to chancelloriids= Porter (2008) revived an early 1980s idea that the sclerites of Halkieria are extremely similar to those of chancelloriids. These were sessile, bag-like, radially symmetric organisms with an opening at the top. Since their fossils show no signs of a gut or other organs, they were originally classified as some kind of sponge. Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related to sponges on the grounds that the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in modern keratose (horny) demosponges. However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) opposed this view, arguing that: spongin does not appear in all Porifera, but may be a defining feature of the demosponges; the silica-based spines of demosponges are solid, while chancellorid sclerites are hollow and filled with soft tissues connected to the rest of the animal at the bases of the sclerites; chancellorid sclerites were probably made of aragonite, which is not found in demosponges; sponges have loosely bound-together skins called pinacoderms, which are only one cell thick, while the skins of chancellorids were much thicker and shows signs of connective structures called belt desmosomes. In their opinion the presence of belt desmosomes made chancellorids members of the Epitheliazoa, the next higher taxon above the Porifera, to which sponges belong. They thought it was difficult to say whether chancellorids were members of the Eumetazoa, \\"true animals\\" whose tissues are organized into Germ layers: chancellorids' lack of internal organs would seem to exclude them from the Eumetazoa; but possibly chancellorids descended from Eumetazoans that lost these features after becoming sessile filter-feeders. Free full text without images at There are intriguing hints that the Ediacaran genus Ausia may represent a halkieriid ancestor with strong similarity to the chancelloriids. The coelosclerites (\\"hollow sclerites\\") of halkieriids and chancelloriids resemble each other at all levels: both have an internal \\"pulp cavity\\" and a thin external organic layer; the walls are made of the same material, aragonite; the arrangement of the aragonite fibers is in each is the same, running mainly from base to tip but with each being closer to the surface at the end nearest the tip. It is extremely improbable that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related. This dilemma may be resolved in various ways: * One possibility is that chancelloriids evolved from bilaterian ancestors but then adopted a sessile lifestyle and rapidly lost all unnecessary features. However the gut and other internal organs have not been lost in other bilaterians that lost their external bilateral symmetry, such as echinoderms, priapulids, and kinorhynchs. * On the other hand, perhaps chancelloriids are similar to the organisms from which bilaterians evolved. That would imply that the earliest bilaterians had similar coelosclerites. However, there are no fossils of such sclerites before , while Kimberella from was almost certainly a bilaterian, but shows no evidence of sclerites. * One solution to this dilemma may be that preservation of small shelly fossils by coatings of phosphate was common only for a relatively short time, during the Early Cambrian, and that coelosclerite-bearing organisms were alive several million years before and after the time of phosphatic preservation. In fact there are over 25 cases of phosphatic preservation between and , but only one between and . * Alternatively, perhaps the common ancestor of both chancelloriids and halkieriids had very similar but unmineralized coelosclerites, and some intermediate groups independently incorporated aragonite into these very similar structures.

Named in 1996 by Canadian paleontologist Dale Russell, it contains a single species, Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis. The identity of the genus has been debated by scientists, with some considering its fossils to represent material from the closely related species Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, while others have classified it as a separate taxon, forming the clade Spinosaurini with Spinosaurus as its sister taxon. Sigilmassasaurus was a moderately-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore, like most other theropods. It may have had strong neck musculature as evidenced by the morphology of its vertebrae (backbones). Sigilmassasaurus may have had semiaquatic habits and a largely piscivorous (fish-eating) diet. It coexisted with other large theropods in the Kem Kem Formation.  History of research  Fossils of this dinosaur were recovered at the Kem Kem Formation in the Tafilalt Oasis region of Morocco, near the site of the ancient city of Sijilmassa, for which it was named. Canadian paleontologist Dale Russell named Sigilmassasaurus in 1996, from the ancient city and the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"). A single species was named, S. brevicollis, which is derived from the Latin brevis (\\"short\\") and collum (\\"neck\\"), because the neck vertebrae are very short from front to back. Sigilmassasaurus comes from red sandstone sediments in southern Morocco, which are known by various names, including the Gr√®s rouges infrac√©nomaniens, Continental Red Beds, and lower Kem Kem Beds. These rocks date back to the Cenomanian, the earliest stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, approximately 100 to 94 million years ago. The holotype, or original specimen, of S. brevicollis, CMN 41857, is a single posterior neck vertebra, although Russell referred about fifteen other vertebrae found in the same formation to the species. Other material had been found in Egypt, and was referred to by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer as \\"Spinosaurus B\\". Russell in 1996 considered this Egyptian specimen, IPHG 1922 X45, to belong to Sigilmassasaurus or a closely related animal, naming it as a Sigilmassasaurus sp. A second Sigilmassasaurus sp. was by him based on specimen CMN 41629, an anterior dorsal vertebra. \\"Spinosaurus B\\" would be intermediate in build between this latter Sigilmassasaurus sp. and S. brevicollis. Russell created the family Sigilmassasauridae for these animals. The neck vertebrae of these dinosaurs are wider from side to side, about 50%, than they are long from front to back. Whether the neck as a whole was particularly short, is unknown: the holotype vertebra is a cervicodorsal, from the transition between the neck and the back, which would not be long anyway. The exact position of Sigilmassasaurus within the theropod family tree is unknown, but it belongs somewhere inside the theropod subgroup known as Tetanurae and most likely was a member of the family Spinosauridae. = Disputed validity = Neck reconstructions of Sigilmassasaurus (top) and BaryonyxThe validity of Sigilmassaurus, however, did not go unchallenged shortly after it was named. In 1996, Paul Sereno and colleagues described a Carcharodontosaurus skull (SGM-Din-1) from Morocco, as well as a neck vertebra (SGM-Din-3) which resembled that of \\"Spinosaurus B,\\" which they therefore synonymized with Carcharodontosaurus. A later in 1998 study went further, calling Sigilmassasaurus itself a junior synonym of Carcharodontosaurus. In 2005, however, Argentine paleontologist Fernando Novas and colleagues found that SGM-Din-3, which was used to synonymize Carcharodontosaurus and \\"Spinosaurus B\\" was not actually associated with SGM-Din-1, the Carcharodontosaurus skull described in 1996, and shows clear differences with the holotype of Carcharodontosaurus. Other features of \\"Spinosaurus B\\" also differed from Carcharodontosaurus, lending support to the notion that it (and therefore Sigilmassasaurus) is a separate taxon. The same study claimed that the tail vertebrae by Russell assigned to the species were in fact those of iguanodonts. A study in 2013 by Bradley McFeeters and colleagues considered Sigilmassasaurus as valid and an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. In 2014, German-Moroccan paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim and colleagues referred the specimens of Sigilmassasaurus to Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, together with \\"Spinosaurus B\\" as the neotype of S. aegyptiacus, and Spinosaurus maroccanus was considered as a nomen dubium following the conclusions of previous papers. Supplementary Information In a 2015 re-description of Sigilmassasaurus by Serjoscha Evers and his team, it was considered a valid genus within the Spinosauridae. This authors also proposed Spinosaurus maroccanus as a junior synonym of Sigilmassasaurus, and rejected the proposal of a Spinosaurus aegyptiacus neotype. A study by British paleontologist Thomas Arden and colleagues in 2018 concluded that Sigilmassasaurus was a valid genus and formed a tribe with Spinosaurus termed Spinosaurini. The largest specimen of Spinosaurus cf. aegyptiacus, MSNM V4047, was tentatively assigned to S. brevicollis. On the basis of vertebrae, the researchers suggested that Sigilmassasaurus may have grown larger than Spinosaurus. Although in the absence of associated material, it is difficult to be certain what material belongs to which genus. Below is a cladogram based on the analysis by Arden and colleagues: Spinosaurine snout specimen (MNSM V4047), Milan Natural History Museum, which was originally assigned to Spinosaurus A 2020 study by British paleontologist Symth and colleagues suggested that Sigilmassasaurus is synonymous with Spinosaurus and the Brazilian spinosaurine genus Oxalaia, with both genera falling into the Spinosaurus hypodigm. If supported by future research, both Sigilmassasaurus and Oxalaia would be rendered junior synonyms of Spinosaurus and expand its range, which would further support the theory of faunal interchanges between Africa and South America during the Cretaceous.  Paleobiology  Reconstructed skeleton of the related genus Spinosaurus, National Geographic Museum, Washington, D.C. On the bottoms of its cervical vertebrae, Sigilmassasaurus bore a series of highly rugged bony structures. These were suggested by Evers and colleagues as being possible evidence for substantial neck musculature, since the attachment sites of muscles and ligaments are often indicated by scarring on the bone surface. The neck muscles inferred from Sigilmassasaurus in particular would have enabled it to rapidly snatch fish out of the water, as indicated by the use of similarly- placed musculature in modern birds and crocodilians. This has also been proposed for the related genus Irritator, on account of the prominent sagittal crest running towards the back of its head. However, Evers and colleagues noted that a more thorough biomechanical analysis is required for confirmation of this condition in Sigilmassasaurus. Several large theropods (more than one tonne) are known from the Cenomanian of northern Africa, raising questions about how such animals would have coexisted. Species of Spinosaurus, the longest known theropod, have been found in both Morocco and Egypt, as has the huge Carcharodontosaurus. Two smaller theropods, Deltadromeus and Bahariasaurus, have also been found in Morocco and Egypt, respectively, and may be closely related or possibly the same genus. Sigilmassasaurus, from Morocco, and \\"Spinosaurus B\\", from Egypt, represent a fourth type of large predator. This situation resembles that in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America, which boasts up to five theropod genera over one tonne in weight, as well as several smaller genera. Differences in head shape and body size among the large North African theropods may have been enough to allow niche partitioning as seen among the many different predator species found today in the African savanna.

It is performed in Arabic, English, French, Berber languages (Tamazight), and local Arabic dialects. Like most artists of the genre, the artists from the Arab world are highly influenced by American culture. Also considered part of Arabic hip hop are emcees of Arab origin in the Arab diaspora including Europe, North America, and Australia. History Before Arabic hip-hop emerged as a separate genre, Arab-Americans were regularly involved in hip-hop in the United States, notably Los Angeles based producer Fredwreck and Miami-based DJ Khaled. American hip-hop music began to see popularity in the Arab World in the early-to-mid 1990s. Northern African Arabs, mostly residing in France, the epicenter of European hip-hop, were the first to begin making the music that constitutes the Arabic hip-hop genre. For example, the Super Saian Crew and IAM had Arabic members. This music, a product of the French banlieue's beur and noir communities, was a blend of traditional American hip-hop, the French styles popular at the time, and Ra√Ø, a popular music style from Northern Africa. French hip-hop rose to popularity partly because of Francophone radio broadcasting requirements, begun in 1994, that established quotas for all stations of 40% of daily broadcasts to be in French. Groups began to emerge in Palestine in the mid-90s, including popular group DAM. DJ Lethal Skillz was promoting new local groups \\"such as Aks El Seir\\" at around the same time. In Egypt, hip-hop was less popular, but a small buzz led to an emergent b-boy population. In 2004, the first hip-hop show took place there when the RZA, member of the Wu-Tang Clan, performed in the Siag Hotel in Cairo alongside Kinetic 9 of Killarmy, a Wu-Tang Clan affiliate, Cilvaringz (a Moroccan-Dutch, and the first Arab to get signed by an American rap group) and Saleh Edin, an Arab Moroccan rapper. In 2006, Arabic hip-hop solidified its mainstream presence in the Arab World with Hip Hop Na, a reality TV show on MTV Arabia hosted by Fredwreck and Qusai, a Saudi Arabian Artist. Hip-hop, both Arabic and American, is followed and created to varying degrees in most of the countries of the Arab world, including where social and political restrictions make this difficult. For example, Saudi Arabia is home to the group Dark2Men, who competed in the HipHopNa reality show mentioned above. In addition, break dancing \\"has become a popular pastime in the kingdom\\". It is difficult to establish numbers for albums sold or listenership by demographic in the Arab world due to the lack of reliable statistics. Furthermore, viewership of satellite TV in the Arab world cannot be accurately quantified. However, we can discern popularity through marketing techniques utilized by satellite television providers. According to a 2007 report, \\"more than 85 percent of urban households in the Arab world have satellite television,\\" a forum that has expanded to include music channels such as MTV Arabia which \\"[at the time] plan[ned] to offer a hefty dose of [mainly western] hip-hop and much of the same youth-lifestyle programming MTV beams across the U.S.\\" =Female hip-hop= Although it is unclear whether or not there is a separate and distinct female Arabic hip-hop genre, artists such as Shadia Mansour from Palestine and Malikah from Lebanon, are very eloquent in the Arabic Hip-Hop art form, then we have the Egyptian EmpresS *1 the \\"First Female Egyptian Rapper\\" in Egypt that is more on the African tip giving credit to both her African and Arabian roots. Female hip-hop artists are involved in a number of outreach activities in the Arab, African and International World. In 2010 EmpresS *1 was invited from Egypt to Khartoum, Sudan by the Ministry of Culture, Studio One and Space, to workshop and perform at Beit el Fenoon, working with young Sudanese rappers, poets and singers from different parts of Sudan.'ÿßŸÖÿ®ÿ±ÿ≥ ŸàÿßŸÜ' ŸÖÿ∑ÿ±ÿ®ÿ© ÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ∑ÿßŸÜŸäÿ© ŸÖŸÜ ÿ£ÿµŸÑ ŸÖÿµÿ±Ÿä Ÿàÿ™ÿ∫ŸÜŸä ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßÿ® ŸàÿßŸÑŸáŸäÿ® ŸáŸàÿ® ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ¨ŸÑŸäÿ≤Ÿäÿ© August 2010 http://www.africaalyom.com/web/Details/1025-7/news.htm EmpresS *1 has also done similar work in the UK, Brazil and Egypt. Shadia Mansour Arabia's \\"First Lady of Hip-Hop\\" pays regular visits to Palestine to help with musical aid throughout the war. Female Arab Rappers performed at \\"Home and Exile in Queer Experience\\", a conference organized by Aswat, \\"an organization for Arab lesbians with members in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip\\". Musical influence Arabic hip-hop artists, commensurate with those of the overall genre, engage in the process of sampling. According to Jannis Androutsopoulos, sampling is \\"a process of cultural literacy and intertextual reference... taken from various domains, such as traditional folk music, contemporary popular music, mass media samples, and even poetry.\\" Artists in the genre cite musical references, influences, and sampling material from a number of contemporary and classical sources, including 20th century Lebanese singers Fairuz, Majida al-Roumi, and Julia Boutros, as well as a number of modern mainstream and underground hip-hop artists, and regional music styles from countries such as Jamaica. Arabic hip hop artists have used full Arabic orchestras in beat-making as well as beats inspired by traditional Arabic music styles. Certain regional variations of the music, most notably French and Northern African styles, incorporate influences from the musical genre known as Ra√Ø, \\"a form of folk music that originated in Oran, Algeria from Bedouin shepherds, mixed with Spanish, French, African and Arabic musical forms, which dates back to the 1930s.\\" Political and social influence Much of the hip-hop generated in the Arab World deals with a mix of social circumstances, such as poverty, violence, and drug use, as well as political reality, insofar as this is possible given censorship. The hip-hop of Palestine in particular has generated much interest in this respect and the music is considered a means of opposition. For example, the song \\"Meen Erhabe\\" by DAM aligns itself with opposition to the Israeli occupation, and was referred to critically as a \\"theme song for Hamas\\". Palestinian hip-hop trio DAM Arabic hip-hop has been both an active player in and directly influenced by the changing political and social conditions of the region over the past two years. The Arab Spring, in particular, as a revolutionary movement affecting numerous states, including Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen, elicited musical responses from emergent or formerly repressed hip-hop artists. Issues such as poverty, rising unemployment, hunger, and oppressive authoritarian regimes were all part of the politicized messages of hip-hop music. Hip-hop served as a mode of resistance in dissenting against authoritarian states, as well as a tool for mobilization in mass demonstrations. As such, the conventions of the hip-hop genre within the Arab context, provided a voice for marginalized citizens within these revolutionary and subsequently transitional states. Arabic hip-hop is most typically directed towards and most relevant to youth populations, who made up a substantial number of political actors in the Arab Spring.Gordts, Eline. 28 March 2012. \\"Hip-Hop and The Arab Revolts: From '#JAN25' To '#Syria.'\\" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/28/hip-hop-arab-revolts_n_1385338.html . Hip-hop music that emerged from the Arab Spring movements, though directly influenced by particular social and political realities, transcended borders and resonated throughout the region. This was largely achieved through social media, as artists and activists share their music via Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Outside of the Arab World, artists focus on many of the same types of issues, but there is a stronger focus on issues associated with immigration and living as ethnic minorities. In France, for example, much of the \\"socially critical\\" music focuses on \\"migration related problems such as discrimination, xenophobia, and the problematic identities of young people of foreign descent.\\" Furthermore, these artists deal with the government enforced impetus for assimilation \\"coupled with the age-old stereotypes rooted in colonial references and the stigma of the marginalized banlieue.\\" Arabic hip-hop artists in the west, particularly Great Britain and North America, who also deal with racism and marginalization in their content, specifically mention an experience of \\"doubleness\\" ‚Äì internal conflict between traditional and modern culture. For some rap and spoken word artists, hip-hop is seen as being true to both, due both to the rich Arabic poetic history and to the utility of hip- hop as a form of expression for marginalized or demonized communities. The poet Lawrence Joseph addresses the conflict explicitly in his poem \\"Sand Nigger\\". The view of mainstream America towards the Arab population, domestically and worldwide, and military intervention in the MENA region factor prominently in Arab-American hip-hop and other western forms. Certain artists from the Arab world approach the western viewpoint similarly, such as the Emirati group Desert Heat who rap in English specifically for the purpose of \\"educating\\" westerners on a realistic view of Arabic culture and history. On the other extreme, Mohammed Kamel Mostafa, whose father Abu Hamza al-Masri is in prison on terrorism charges, uses hip-hop to express solidarity with groups such as Hizbollah and Hamas, as well as to glorify violent Jihad. His message is different from other opposition rappers who have gained popularity in the genre insofar as he explicitly establishes his credentials by referencing his military skill and ability to cause violence. Censorship Associative life and media are restricted to varying degrees throughout the Arab world. Reasons for censorship, whether state enforced or community enforced, generally fall under two categories ‚Äì political or religious. Vis-a- vis state control, satellite TV has done much to restrict the state monopoly on television programming. This has directly impacted the space allowed for hip-hop music and culture. In religiously conservative Arab states, such as Saudi Arabia, \\"singing and dancing can be viewed as shameful,\\" therefore enforcing somewhat of a social censorship (enforced as a \\"taboo\\") on hip-hop and other art forms. As of 2008, concerts and nightclubs were non-existent in the Kingdom, and local radio and TV played mainly Arabic pop music (all state enforced policies). Tamer Farhan, a member of the Saudi rap group Dark2Men that appeared on HipHopNa, said that rappers in Saudi Arabia are forced \\"underground because of the wrong impression people have of them\\". Even socially cautious acts are subject to censorship. This phenomenon is not restricted to Saudi Arabia however, as relatively liberal Kuwait joined them in banning the group Desert Heat's first album despite their \\"pro-Muslim\\" message and \\"cautious approach to religion, politics, and society\\". However, hip-hop music, both Arabic and American, has managed to circumnavigate some of these restrictions. In addition to subversion via the internet or bootleg record sales, it seems that censorship inconsistencies and/or linguistic difficulty associated with translating hip-hop from English may account for some English language records making their way to cities where they would otherwise be banned. Abdullah Dahman of Desert Heat offers an example of west coast rapper Snoop Dogg, whose records are available for purchase in Jiddah in Saudi Arabia. Another example, 2 Live Crew's album \\"As Nasty as They Wanna Be\\", released in 1989, made it by censors due to translational difficulty. Hip-hop music from the Arab Spring movement presented direct challenges to the strict censorship policies of many regimes throughout the Middle East and North African region. Arabic hip-hop became a means of expression that actively resisted against the state and its regulations. In states like Tunisia, a state that previously censored all negative public statements against the government and was characterized as having one of the least free media in the world, hip-hop music became a visible representation of the resistance and signaled the impending social and political changes. Several rappers were arrested for their music, including El General in Tunisia and El Haqed of Morocco, which only generated more attention to the issue of censorship and the artists themselves. Regional Arabic hip hop Hip hop communities in different Arab countries are interconnected with each other to varying degrees and also have connections to their respective diaspora communities in the US and Europe. = United Arab Emirates = Hip-hop was found in Forums Year 2001 in the United Arab Emirates was not given his rights for being too Underground for listeners, There aren't many rappers in the UAE Unfortunately no one wants to listen. Desert Heat was Formed in late 2002 ,consists of two Emirati brothers ‚ÄòIllmiyah‚Äô (eel-mee-yah) & ‚ÄòArableak‚Äô, Mustafa qarooni Emirati Rapper known with his stage name Dj Sadcat started in 2004, In the year 2009 Sadcat had met a Car Accident in which created a song (Surrounded) for his situation the song was on youtube until the listeners they started reporting the song for be to real and sad to listen = Saudi Arabia = Klash with Loon (rapper) in Jeddah Hip-hop in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia emerged around 2003. Hip hop emerged as an on-line community as rappers shared their work online and competed for fans in the \\"underground field\\". A rapper called Klash became infamous due to allegations of racism in his lyrics. Klash, along with friends he rapped with, initially focused on social issues such as unemployment and nepotism. It was common for teenager and young adult social circles, for example, a group of friends who are also neighbors, to be referred to as gangs. These gangs continued to produce music while following the same theme. However, a diss was released against Klash, by an individual who was accused of taking offense to the prevalent lyrical themes, and thus seeking revenge. Klash dissed that individual back, and soon Klash, and an increasing number of rappers turned their attention to releasing diss tracks. Klash's diss tracks attracted many fans. This point leaded the youth society to take this style which made Klash's fame.http://www.okaz.com.sa/new/Issues/20110616/Con20110616427055.htm =Tunisia= Hamada Ben Amor, known as El General, is a Tunisian rapper. El General's popularity is largely attributable to his musical contributions to the Jasmine Revolution that took place in his home country. El General began producing hip-hop music prior to the revolution and largely relied upon social media to publicize his music. His first recording, \\"Rais LeBled,\\" was posted to YouTube in November 2010. The song was an attack on the former authoritarian ruler, Zine El Abidine Ben-Ali, and the poor conditions in the state, including poverty, unemployment, and political and social injustices. Following the suicide attempt by Mohammed Bouazizzi in Sidi Bouzzid, Tunisia, which prompted the revolutionary movement, El General's music was used in ensuing demonstrations. El General released subsequent songs, which similarly criticize the government and called for the end to Ben-Ali's regime. Consequently, he was arrested and imprisoned by Tunisian state police. His imprisonment further propelled the popularity of his music and activists demanded his release. El General was released soon after Ben-Ali fled the country in January 2011. El General is widely considered to be one of the largest musical influences emerging from the Arab Spring and is considered to have made direct contributions to political activism during the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia. = Yemen = The hip hop major outbreak in Yemen is often associated to the influence of Hagage \\"AJ\\" Masaed, an American-Yemeni rapper producing music since 1997. Although he had grown in the United States, AJ has successfully reached Yemeni audience by addressing to local issues and incorporating traditional musical language into his hits. This versatility was also one of the reasons he drew international recognition, since he entered in the Yemeni music scene, he has been partnering up with several Yemeni artists, such as Hussein Muhib, Fuad Al-Kibisi, Fuad Al-Sharjabi, Ibrahim Al-Taefi, Abdurahman Al-Akhfash and others, and helping new ones to develop their talents. He has also played a major role on propagating the understanding of rap as a means of change. One contributing factor to the development of the music is also the creation of Yemen Music House in 2007. that has been providing assets to the development of a contemporary music scene In 2009, took place the first Yemeni Rap public festival, co-sponsored by the French and German foreign-missions Due to the importance of this event, AJ draws a comparison between it and the fall of the Berlin wall. = Syria = Refugees Of Rap (Arabic: ŸÑÿßÿ¨ÿ¶Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßÿ®; French: \\"Les R√©fugi√©s Du Rap\\") is a Syrian - Palestinian hip-hop group. Based in Paris, France, It was in 2007, in a Palestinian refugee camp in Yarmouk, Syria, that the brothers, Yaser and Mohamed Jamous, created this group. Their texts offer a glimpse of life in the camp and denounce the situation in Syria. They are forced into exile in 2013 and become refugees in France the same year. From their collaboration came several artistic projects. From 2007 to 2012 the band performs concerts and performs in Syria in Egyptand Lebanon. At the same time two albums are released in 2010 and 2014 and are the result of various collaborations (Tamer Nafar(DAM), Tarabband, Linda Bitar etc.). Since their arrival in Europe until today, the group has performed in several festivals, participated in several artistic and associative projects (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway) (2015 Summer Camps (Rennes), Warm-up Roskilde Festival(Denmark 2017), IMA institut du monde arabe2017 Poetry Night, F√™te de l'Humanit√©2016 2017 etc..). In the continuity of their project, the two brothers offer musical workshops to young teens. These are writing workshops around the notion of freedom of expression, where messages of peace and tolerance circulate. A humanist approach that democratizes rap and allows young people from all walks of life to express themselves through music and words. Throughout their career, the group has attracted the interest of several media such as Rolling Stone magazine, the World, BBCor ARTE, Vice, Konbini, The Guardian, Radio France, TV5 Complex... Refugees of Rap also organized a \\"rap writing\\" workshop last one was at Octave Mirbeau College in Tr√©vi√®res. Omar Offendum is a Syrian American hip-hop artist, designer, poet and peace activist. He was born in Saudi Arabia, raised in Washington, DC, and now lives in Los Angeles, California. His song #Jan25, inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt, went viral in 2011, shortly before the resignation of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak Omar Offendum has often collaborated with Yassin Alsalman also known as Narcy and with renowned hip-hop artist Shadia Mansour. Amir Almuarri (Arabic: ÿ£ŸÖŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ±Ÿä). In 2019, Idlib-based rapper Amir Almuarri achieved worldwide recognition for his music, which throws light on the suffering of the Syrian people under siege. His latest composition, \\"On all fronts\\", where he rages against all those involved in the fighting, received widespread coverage by Arabic and international media.

Early life and career John Keatly Forsyth was born in Brisbane, Queensland on 8 February 1867, the son of a builder. He was educated at Fortitude Valley State and the Normal School, Brisbane and became a clerk in a sawmill and later in a solicitor's office. Forsyth enlisted in the Queensland Mounted Rifles Regiment as a trooper in November 1885. He served as a non commissioned officer before being commissioned a second lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry on 18 July 1892. He was promoted to lieutenant on 4 November 1892 and captain on 22 September 1896. He joined the Queensland Permanent Forces at a staff lieutenant on 1 August 1897, and was promoted to captain on 1 February 1901. Forsyth served as adjutant of the 4th Queensland Mounted Infantry from 1 March 1901 to 27 February 1902, of the 2nd Queensland Mounted Infantry and 4th Infantry Regiment from 28 February 1902 to 30 June 1902, and of the 2nd Queensland Mounted Infantry again from 1 July 1902 to 12 November 1905. Forsyth moved to Melbourne, where he served as a staff officer. He became secretary to the inspector general, Major General Finn, from 13 November 1905 to 1 October 1906. He joined the Victorian Instructional Staff on 1 February 1907 and was promoted to major on 28 May 1908. In 1909‚Äì1910 he was posted to India on exchange duty with the British Indian Army as brigade major of the Amballa Cavalry Brigade. Returning to Melbourne, he was deputy assistant adjutant general (DAAG) for instruction from 1 to 31 December 1910. Forsyth was a GSO2 at Army Headquarters from 1 November 1911 to 30 June 1912, became director of equipment on 1 July 1907, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 March 1914. On 1 August 1914, he became quartermaster general and a member of the Military Board. First World War On 15 August 1914 Forsyth joined the Australian Imperial Force as a temporary colonel. Appointed to command the 1st Division's mounted regiment, the 4th Light Horse Regiment, he also took on responsibility for raising the 1st Light Horse Brigade, whose commander designate, Colonel Harry Chauvel, was still on duty in the United Kingdom. Forsyth embarked with the brigade on 21 October 1914 and handed over command to Chauvel on the latter's arrival in Egypt in November 1914. Forsyth then concentrated on training his own regiment, who referred to him as \\"Dad\\". In May 1915, the light horse were ordered to Gallipoli dismounted to reinforce the infantry. Forsyth arrived at Anzac Cove on 5 May 1915. On 19 May 1915, he became the Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (AA & QMG) of the 1st Division. From 30 May to 8 June he was acting commander of the 2nd Brigade in the absence of Colonel James Whiteside McCay, who had been wounded at Krithia, along with most of the brigade's officers. When McCay was evacuated with a broken leg, Forsyth became commander of the 2nd Brigade on 26 July 1915 and was promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general. He remained at Anzac with his brigade, fighting another battle at the German Officers' Trench in August, until it was evacuated to Mudros on 10 December 1915. The 2nd Brigade returned to Egypt in January 1916, and moved to Serapeum, where it guarded the Suez Canal. On 27 March 1916, it sailed for France. The brigade spent a time in the relatively quiet Armenti√®res sector before it was committed on the Somme at Pozi√®res in July. There it was subjected to intense artillery bombardments. Forsyth suffered a breakdown in his health and was evacuated to England. When he was discharged from the hospital, he became commander of 'B' Training Group at Rollestone, England. Ill health forced his return to Australia in December 1916. For his services on the Western Front he was mentioned in dispatches and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 1 January 1917. Post war Forsyth became Commandant of the 4th Military District (South Australia) on 16 February 1917 and was promoted to brevet colonel on 24 September 1917. On 2 July 1918, he once again became Quartermaster General and a member of the Military Board. He was promoted to temporary major general in January 1921 but had to relinquish the rank when he was placed on the unattached list in 1922. He retired with the honorary rank of major general on 9 February 1925. In 1928, Forsyth was selected as a Nationalist Party candidate for the Senate. While campaigning in Sea Lake, Victoria, he came down with influenza and died nine days later on 12 November 1928. He was buried at Boroondara Cemetery, Kew, with full military honours.

Club career Johnson came through the youth ranks at his first professional club, Southend United. Johnson made his professional debut when he started the Football League Trophy match for Southend at home to Cheltenham Town in 1999. Southend lost 1‚Äì0 to go out of the cup, and Johnson played no more part in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. At the end of September in the 2000‚Äì01 season, Johnson came on as a substitute in the 1‚Äì0 win at Rochdale. By the end of January, Johnson had established himself as a decent defender and he played in a total of 26 games and scored his first goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Chesterfield at the Recreation Ground. In the 2001‚Äì02 season, Johnson made 34 appearances for Southend in all competitions. However, as Southend only finished 12th in League One, cost-cutting meant that Johnson was released from the Roots Hall club on a free transfer. He spent time on trial at nearby club Gillingham during the close-season summer of 2002. Johnson impressed in several friendlies for the Gills who soon signed him up on a full-time contract. Johnson was not seen as first choice for the Gills at the beginning of his career. His first competitive appearance in a Gills shirt came in the middle of September as a late substitute for David Perpetuini. Despite making 20 appearances that season (18 in the league) as Gillingham finished a record high of 11th in the league. He never established himself as a first team regular, however and he only made 21 appearances the next season and only eight the season after that. It was, however, the 2005‚Äì06 season that saw Johnson stake a claim for a regular first team spot. Johnson made around 30 appearances in total, and perhaps would have made more were it not for three suspensions (two following red cards, one following his fifth booking of the season). Johnson scored his first goal for Gillingham against Milton Keynes Dons on New Year's Eve 2005 in a 3‚Äì0 win at Priestfield when he headed home Andrew Crofts' flick on following Michael Flynn's long ball. = Wycombe Wanderers = He was released by Gillingham in May 2007 and signed for Wycombe the following month.BBC Sport Johnson was a regular in the Wycombe team throughout the season and was awarded at the end of the year with the Fans' Player of the Year Award. He went on to sign a one-year extension, which kept him at the club until the summer of 2010. He then once again extended his contract for a further two years. He has been involved in two promotions at the club, having three managers in his spell at the club. In May 2014 Johnson was released after a series of injuries following Wycombe's final day league survival. When he left he had the second highest league appearance and fourth highest appearance total of any player at the club. International career Although he was born in England, Johnson qualifies to play for Grenada through his father. On 20 May 2011, he was included in the Grenada squad for the 2011 Gold Cup. Johnson played in all three of Grenada's games in the group stage, but the team was eliminated from the tournament after three heavy defeats.

They grow naturally in rainforests and margins of adjoining humid forests in eastern Australia and New Guinea. Some species are known as native tamarind or small-leaved tamarind; they have no direct relationship with the true tamarind. One Australian species, D. australis is grown as a street tree in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, principally Lismore and is known locally as the native tamarind. Another endemic Australian species is D. campbellii, also known as the small- leaved tamarind, is rare and threatened and is restricted to a small number of sites each with a maximum of three trees per site. There are a total of 42 known mature wild trees in south-east Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales. However, the tree, as a seedling, is readily available from nurseries in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, and in south-eastern Queensland. The small-leaved tamarind grows to 30 metres and has a compact canopy, making it good to use as a screening tree. It has small three-lobed fruit capsules. The fruit is edible and is commercially produced as bushfood. It is red when ripe and can be made into jam. D. campbellii seedling Naming and classification The species currently known as D. australis was the first that European scientists collected specimens of, for instance botanist Robert Brown in 1804. Before formal naming, this species was grown up to a flowering tree in a glasshouse in Kew gardens, UK. In 1862 Joseph Dalton Hooker first established this genus name Diploglottis in Genera Plantarum and the following year George Bentham formally published the D. cunninghamii name combination. Earlier in 1831 however, George Don had published a formal description of this taxon named with the epithet australis, with a different name genus. In 1878‚Äì9 Ludwig A. T. Radlkofer published his referral of this taxon to the name combination Diploglottis australis. In 1986 Gwen Harden and Lawrie Johnson published the clarification of the further involved history of these names. Sally T. Reynolds had proposed D. cunninghamii as the correct name in 1981. Harden and Johnson clarified that D. australis legitimately has support as the correct name, for this type species. In 1978 P. W. Leenhouts described the new species D. bracteata. In 1981 and 1987 Reynolds described several different new species. In 1985 Reynolds‚Äô account of the genus in Australia was published in the Flora of Australia volume 25. In 1994 in Flora Malesiana P. W. Leenhouts included D. australis occurring in New Guinea, however the record has been corrected to the superficially similar D. diphyllostegia which in Australia also grows in areas adjacent to New Guinea and further north than the northernmost D. australis records.

The war was initiated by Athens's intervention in a dispute between Samos and Miletus. When the Samians refused to break off their attacks on Miletus as ordered, the Athenians easily drove out the oligarchic government of Samos and installed a garrison in the city, but the oligarchs soon returned, with Persian support. A larger Athenian fleet was dispatched to suppress this agitation. This fleet initially defeated the Samians and blockaded the city, but Pericles, in command, was then forced to lead a substantial portion of the fleet away upon learning that the Persian fleet was approaching from the south. Although the Persians turned back before the two fleets met, the absence of most of the Athenian fleet allowed the Samians to drive off the remaining blockaders and, for two weeks, control the sea around their island; upon Pericles's return, however, the Athenians again blockaded and besieged Samos; the city surrendered nine months later. Under the terms of the surrender, the Samians tore down their walls, gave up hostages, surrendered their fleet, and agreed to pay Athens a war indemnity over the next 26 years. During the course of the war, the Samians had apparently appealed to Sparta for assistance; the Spartans were initially inclined to grant this request, and were prevented from doing so primarily by Corinth's unwillingness to participate in a war against Athens at the time. In 433 BC, when Corcyra requested Athenian assistance against Corinth, the Corinthians would remind the Athenians of the good will they had shown at this time. Prelude and dispute In 440 BC Samos was at war with Miletus about Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale.Unless otherwise noted, all details of the rebellion and war are drawn from Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.115-117 Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens with loud complaints against the Samians. Miletus was militarily weak, having been compelled to disarm and pay tribute after rebelling from Athens twice, once in the 450s and again in 446 BC; Samos, meanwhile, was one of only three remaining fully independent states in the Delian League.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 170 The Athenians, for reasons that scholars continue to disagree over‚Äîsome believe that the Athenians were influenced by a desire to protect the Milesian democracy against the Samian oligarchs,Meiggs, The Athenian Empire, 190 while others believe that they were concerned for the credibility of their rule if they failed to protect a state that they themselves had disarmedKagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 170‚Äîintervened on behalf of Miletus. A fleet of forty triremes, commanded by Pericles, was dispatched to Samos; Pericles established a democracy, and then, after taking 100 hostages to the island of Lemnos and leaving a garrison at Samos, returned home.Plutarch, Pericles, 25.1-3 This had all been achieved with remarkable ease, and this, in comparison with the stiff resistance that the Samians put up later, suggests that they had not expected such a harsh response from the Athenians.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 172 Rebellion Pissuthnes, the Satrap of Lydia and Ionia supported the Samian revolt. The settlement thus imposed did not last long, however. A group of oligarchs fled to the mainland, secured the support of Pissuthnes, the Persian satrap of Lydia, who provided them with mercenaries and also rescued their hostages from Lemnos.Plutarch, Pericles, 26.1 With their hands thus freed, the oligarchs, collaborating with allies in the city, invaded with the 700 mercenaries of Pissuthnes, defeated the democrats, and handed all the Athenians in the city over to Pissuthnes for imprisonment. Athens now found itself facing a serious crisis in the open revolt of a powerful subject state, and the situation was made more severe by simultaneous revolts in other parts of the empire, the most critical of which occurred in Byzantium; the powerful city of Mytilene, meanwhile, stood ready to revolt upon receiving a promise of Spartan support.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 172 The Athenians immediately dispatched 60 ships to deal with the situation in the Aegean. 16 of these ships were sent on various independent missions, leaving only 44 to face the Samian fleet of 50 triremes and 20 transports. In a battle off the island of Tragia, the Athenians were victorious, and the Samians soon found themselves blockaded by land and sea. The Athenians constructed walls around the city of Samos, and meanwhile were reinforced by 65 more ships from Athens, Chios, and Lesbos. At this point, with the rebellion seemingly well in hand, Pericles received word that the Persian fleet was on its way to attack him, and, taking 60 ships with him, he sailed off to Caria to meet it. In his absence the Samians made a sally and drove the Athenians off. For 14 days they ruled the sea and brought in supplies, but at the end of that period Pericles returned and reestablished the blockade. The siege lasted 9 months, at the end of which the Samians surrendered, tore down their walls, converted their government to a democracy, gave up their fleet, and agreed to pay Athens a war indemnity of 1,300 talents over a period of 26 years.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 176 The end of the revolts elsewhere in the empire followed rapidly on this success.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 176-7 Sparta Although Athens did succeed in restoring order to the empire, the situation in 440 BC was very severe, particularly because of the threat of Spartan intervention.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 173 Thucydides reports that in 433 BC, when Corinthian and Corcyraean ambassadors were making their cases at Athens regarding Corcyra's request for assistance against Corinth, the Corinthians stated that in 440, \\"when the rest of the Peloponnesian powers were equally divided on the question whether they should assist [the Samians],...we told them to their face that every power has a right to punish its own allies.\\"Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.40 Modern scholars have generally regarded this as an accurate report, and have taken it to mean that Sparta was willing to go to war against Athens, but that the Corinthians, whose powerful navy would have been necessary for the Peloponnesians to participate effectively in such a war, derailed the plan with their opposition.See Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 173-5, Meiggs, The Athenian Empire, 190, and de Ste.

Deformable mirrors (DM) are mirrors whose surface can be deformed, in order to achieve wavefront control and correction of optical aberrations. Deformable mirrors are used in combination with wavefront sensors and real- time control systems in adaptive optics. In 2006 they found a new use in femtosecond pulse shaping.http://www.adaptiveoptics.org/News_0106_2.html The shape of a DM can be controlled with a speed that is appropriate for compensation of dynamic aberrations present in the optical system. In practice the DM shape should be changed much faster than the process to be corrected, as the correction process, even for a static aberration, may take several iterations. A DM usually has many degrees of freedom. Typically, these degrees of freedom are associated with the mechanical actuators and it can be roughly taken that one actuator corresponds to one degree of freedom.  Deformable mirror parameters  VLT‚Äôs Deformable Secondary Mirror Number of actuators determines the number of degrees of freedom (wavefront inflections) the mirror can correct. It is very common to compare an arbitrary DM to an ideal device that can perfectly reproduce wavefront modes in the form of Zernike polynomials. For predefined statistics of aberrations a deformable mirror with M actuators can be equivalent to an ideal Zernike corrector with N (usually N < M) degrees of freedom. For correction of the atmospheric turbulence, elimination of low-order Zernike terms usually results in significant improvement of the image quality, while further correction of the higher-order terms introduces less significant improvements. For strong and rapid wavefront error fluctuations such as shocks and wake turbulence typically encountered in high-speed aerodynamic flowfields, the number of actuators, actuator pitch and stroke determine the maximum wavefront gradients that can be compensated for. Actuator pitch is the distance between actuator centers. Deformable mirrors with large actuator pitch and large number of actuators are bulky and expensive. Actuator stroke is the maximum possible actuator displacement, typically in positive or negative excursions from some central null position. Stroke typically ranges from ¬±1 to ¬±30 micrometres. Free actuator stroke limits the maximum amplitude of the corrected wavefront, while the inter- actuator stroke limits the maximum amplitude and gradients of correctable higher-order aberrations. Influence function is the characteristic shape corresponding to the mirror response to the action of a single actuator. Different types of deformable mirrors have different influence functions, moreover the influence functions can be different for different actuators of the same mirror. Influence function that covers the whole mirror surface is called a \\"modal\\" function, while localized response is called \\"zonal\\". Actuator coupling shows how much the movement of one actuator will displace its neighbors. All \\"modal\\" mirrors have large cross-coupling, which in fact is good as it secures the high quality of correction of smooth low-order optical aberrations that usually have the highest statistical weight. Response time shows how quickly the mirror will react to the control signal. Can vary from microseconds (MEMS and magnetics mirrors) to tens of seconds for thermally controlled DM's. Hysteresis and creep are nonlinear actuation effects that decrease the precision of the response of the deformable mirror. For different concepts, the hysteresis can vary from zero (electrostatically-actuated mirrors) to tens of percent for mirrors with piezoelectric actuators. Hysteresis is a residual positional error from previous actuator position commands, and limits the mirror ability to work in a feedforward mode, outside of a feedback loop.  Deformable mirror concepts  Thin shell mirror for ESO's Very Large Telescope Adaptive Optics Facility. The shell is 1120 millimetres across but just 2 millimetres thick. Segmented concept mirrors are formed by independent flat mirror segments. Each segment can move a small distance back and forth to approximate the average value of the wavefront over the patch area. Advantageously, these mirrors have little or zero cross-talk between actuators. Stepwise approximation works poorly for smooth continuous wavefronts. Sharp edges of the segments and gaps between the segments contribute to light scattering, limiting the applications to those not sensitive to scattered light. Considerable improvement of the performance of the segmented mirror can be achieved by introduction of three degrees of freedom per segment: piston, tip and tilt. These mirrors require three times as many actuators compared to piston segmented mirrors. This concept was used for fabrication of large segmented primary mirrors for the Keck telescopes, JWST, and the future E-ELT. Numerous methods exist to accurately co-phase the segments and reduce the diffraction patterns introduced by the segment shapes and gaps. Future large space-based telescopes, such as the NASA Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor will also possess a segmented primary mirror. The development of robust methods to increase the contrast is key for the direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets. Continuous faceplate concept mirrors with discrete actuators are formed by the front surface of a thin deformable membrane. The shape of the plate is controlled by a number of discrete actuators that are fixed to its back side. The shape of the mirror depends on the combination of forces applied to the faceplate, boundary conditions (the way the plate is fixed to the mirror) and the geometry and the material of the plate. These mirrors allow smooth wavefront control with very large - up to several thousands - degrees of freedom. Magnetics concept mirrors are based on continuous reflective surface motioned by magnetics actuators. They feature large strokes, linearity and fast settling time. MEMS concept mirrors are fabricated using bulk and surface micromachining technologies. They consist of a thin reflective membrane controlled by a multitude of actuators. MEMS mirrors could break the high price threshold of conventional adaptive optics. They enable a higher actuator count at a more cost effective price allowing for accurate wave-front correction. MEMS mirrors offer fast response times from the actuators with limited hysteresis. An additional benefit is that micromachining technologies allow for the benefit of economies of scale to create cheaper and lighter deformable mirrors with a greater number of actuators. Membrane concept mirrors are formed by a thin conductive and reflective membrane stretched over a solid flat frame. The membrane can be deformed electrostatically by applying control voltages to electrostatic electrode actuators that can be positioned under or over the membrane. If there are any electrodes positioned over the membrane, they are transparent. It is possible to operate the mirror with only one group of electrodes positioned under the mirror. In this case a bias voltage is applied to all electrodes, to make the membrane initially spherical. The membrane can move back and forth with respect to the reference sphere. A ferrofluid deformable mirror Bimorph concept mirrors are formed by two or more layers of different materials. One or more of (active) layers are fabricated from a piezoelectric or electrostrictive material. Electrode structure is patterned on the active layer to facilitate local response. The mirror is deformed when a voltage is applied to one or more of its electrodes, causing them to extend laterally, which results in local mirror curvature. Bimorph mirrors are rarely made with more than 100 electrodes. Ferrofluid concept mirrors are liquid deformable mirrors made with a suspension of small (about 10 nm in diameter) ferromagnetic nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid carrier. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the ferromagnetic particles align with the field, the liquid becomes magnetized and its surface acquires a shape governed by the equilibrium between the magnetic, gravitational and surface tension forces. Using proper magnetic field geometries, any desired shape can be produced at the surface of the ferrofluid. This new concept offers a potential alternative for low-cost, high stroke and large number of actuators deformable mirrors.

Elliott speculated that a Grand Supercycle advance had started in the United States stock market in 1857 and ran to the year 1928, but acknowledged another interpretation that it may have been the third or even the fifth Grand Supercycle wave. However, these assignments have been reevaluated and clarified using larger historical financial data sets in the works of A. J. Frost and R.R. Prechter, and the start is now considered to be 1789, when stock market data began to be recorded.Alfred John Frost, Robert Rougelot Prechter, Chapter 5, Figure 5-4 Like all Elliott waves, Grand Supercycle waves are subdivided into smaller generations of waves. The next smaller generation of waves are those of Supercycle degree. Modern applications of the Wave Principle also describe waves of larger degree spanning millennial periods of time. Modern application of Elliott wave theory posits that a Grand Supercycle wave five is completing in the 21st century and should be followed by a corrective price pattern of decline that will represent the largest economic recession since the 1700s.Robert R. Prechter, Jr., Chapters 2 & 5 In technical analysis, Grand Supercycles and Supercycles are often compared to the Kondratiev wave, which is a cycle of 50 to 60 years, but these are in detail distinct concepts. Possible Elliott wave position of world stock markets Some Elliott wave analysts believe that a Grand Supercycle bear market in US and European stocks started in 1987. When that was proven incorrect it was later revised to be 2000 and then 2006.Robert R. Prechter, Jr., Robert R. Prechter, Jr., Preview During 2006‚Äì2007 the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high, which has been interpreted by some Elliott Wave analysts as indicating that 2000‚Äì2002 was not the beginning of a Grand Supercycle bear market. However, as this new high was merely a nominal new high in US dollars, and not a new high when measured in ounces of gold other Elliott Wave analysts believe this new high to be 'phony'.Robert R. Prechter, Jr. FinancialSense interview and transcript Robert R. Prechter, Jr. Tim W. Wood interview Expectation of economic recession A controversial issue is whether the severe economic recession accompanying the termination of the current Grand Supercycle will take the form of either a deflationary depression or a hyperinflationary period. Robert Prechter has repeatedly stated that the collapse will take the form of a deflationary depression probably followed by hyperinflation. This is made clear in the following quotes from October 2006: > JIM: If you were to make your case for deflation right now, what would be > the key factors supporting that view?

The notion of the Grand Supercycle was thus implied by R. N. Elliott by linking together gold prices, British stock market prices, and later U.S. stock market prices, as the U.S. economy surpassed the U.K. It is not clear that this methodology is scientifically robust. * The hypothesized Grand Supercycle is conjectured to span more time than a human life, which some say means it cannot exist. Followers of Saeculum Theory take this view and align instead around a belief that defined sequences of generations relearn approximately the same lessons as their forebears. Similar ideas can be found in the Bible. The Saeculum might map to the Kondratiev cycle. * The idea of a Grand Supercycle bear market may be interpreted to suggest that mankind will never learn from its past mistakes, or become self-aware in a macro-economic sense. The historical study presented in David Hackett Fischer's The Great Wave (Oxford University Press, 1999), however, presents a meticulously argued case that the periodic crises in human history are becoming steadily less volatile, which suggests that some kind of species-wide learning is occurring.

Biography Simmons was born into a middle-class Protestant family in Derry in 1933 and attended Campbell College in Belfast before moving to the University of Leeds to read for a degree in English. He married Laura Stinson and returned to Northern Ireland to teach at Friends' School Lisburn for five years. His final foreign excursion was a position at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria, where he worked for three years. During this time they had five children: Rachael, Sarah, Adam, Helen and Penelope. He returned to Northern Ireland in 1968, accepting a position at the recently opened New University of Ulster in Coleraine, where he remained until his retirement in 1984. During the early '70s ‚Äì the bloodiest times of all in NI ‚Äì he was the inspiration and leading light for The Resistance Cabaret, a satirical revue combining song, poetry and political comment on 'the troubles' and life in general, written and performed by Simmons and some of his students. Arguably, Simmons ‚Äì whose passion for poetry was equaled only by his yearning to make it accessible to all the people ‚Äì felt most at home in this setting, connecting with an audience that was moved to talk back. Near the end of his teaching career at the University of Ulster, Simmons and his first wife Laura divorced. He married Imelda Foley, the sister of Derry poet and fiction writer Michael Foley, and had one child, Anna. After this marriage to Imelda ended, he had a son Ben with his third wife, fellow-poet Janice Fitzpatrick. Simmons and Fitzpatrick started The Poets' House, initially in Islandmagee in County Antrim, later in Falcarragh in County Donegal. Career When Simmons returned to Northern Ireland he took part in The Belfast Group, together with such notables as Michael Longley, Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon. In 1968, with his nephew Michael Stephens, Simmons went on a tour of universities in England. When he returned to Ireland, he established The Honest Ulsterman, the most important Irish literary journal of the next 35 years. Simmons served as the editor for 17 of the first 19 issues; he then passed control of the magazine onto a series of younger editors. The Honest Ulsterman published a series of more than 30 poetry chapbooks, including the first collections of work by Paul Muldoon (\\"Knowing My Place\\"), Michael Foley (\\"The Acne and the Ecstasy\\"), and Michael Stephens (\\"Blues for Chocolate Doherty\\"). Members of the Belfast Group frequently published in The Honest Ulsterman. Whereas John Hewitt, the Ulster poet whom Simmons called 'the grandaddy of us all', ground out his truth by placing himself in the mortar and pestle of nature, Simmons ground his out by placing himself under a self- imposed public scrutiny. Using his own life for material, he explored his frailties in his poetry with the clinical detachment of a laboratory technician, the humour of a big soul, and the vulnerability of a lover. Perhaps his best epitaph is his own: \\"Hiding in humility, In irony, and wit, It would be very hard to prove That Simmons is a shit\\" He won several prizes for his poetry including the Gregory and Cholmondeley Awards. He also wrote a critical biography of Se√°n O'Casey (London: Macmillan). Throughout his career Simmons wrote and performed exquisitely provocative, yet hilarious and humane, songs about every aspect of contemporary life. In 1970 he founded a new platform for bringing these to a wider audience, the satirical revue ‚Äì The Resistance Cabaret ‚Äì with Garvin Crawford, Victor Thompson, David Templeton, Eithne Murphy, Jim Brown, Mike Graves, Jon Marshall and Heather Hutchinson. In varying line-ups, they performed their unique repertoire regularly at venues throughout Northern Ireland until 1976. His poetry collection, West Strand Visions, contains some of the repertoire. He recorded three collections of his own songs ‚Äì City & Eastern, Love In The Post, The Rostrevor Sessions ‚Äì and produced a Resistance Cabaret album with the other members. He also set a number of Yeats' poems to music which he released on a tape cassette. The album was called Women's Company and included original songs and a selection of jazz standards. Since his death Simmons' work has been increasingly marginalised ‚Äì few anthologies include him ‚Äì and a 'Collected Poems' is yet to appear. His songs, however, continue to challenge and delight appreciative audiences of The Resistance Cabaret around Northern Ireland - most often sung by Garvin Crawford in The Dufferin Arms, Killyleagh.

Over 150,000 works are exhibited in 39 exhibition buildings, 25 of which are historic and were relocated to the museum grounds. It is located on near Lake Champlain. Impressionist paintings, folk art, quilts and textiles, decorative arts, furniture, American paintings, and an array of 17th- to 20th-century artifacts are on view. Shelburne is home to collections of 19th-century American folk art, quilts, 19th- and 20th- century decoys, and carriages. Electra Havemeyer Webb was a pioneering collector of American folk art and founded Shelburne Museum in 1947. The daughter of Henry Osborne Havemeyer and Louisine Elder Havemeyer, important collectors of Impressionism, European and Asian art, she exercised an independent eye and passion for art, artifacts, and architecture celebrating a distinctly American aesthetic. When creating the museum, she took the step of collecting 18th and 19th century buildings from New England and New York in which to display the museum's holdings, relocating 20 historic structures to Shelburne. These include houses, barns, a meeting house, a one-room schoolhouse, a lighthouse, a jail, a general store, a covered bridge, and the 220-foot steamboat Ticonderoga. In Shelburne Mrs. Webb sought to create \\"an educational project, varied and alive.\\" Shelburne's collections are exhibited in a village-like setting of historic New England architecture, accented by a landscape that includes over 400 lilacs, a circular formal garden, herb and heirloom vegetable gardens, and perennial gardens. In 2013, the Pizzagalli Center for Art and Education was opened with two galleries, an auditorium, and a classroom, transforming the institution from seasonal (mid-May through October) to year-round operation. While the main campus operates seasonally, the Pizzagalli Center and Museum Store are open year-round. History A round barn at the entrance to the museum The museum's collection was begun by Electra Havemeyer Webb, one of the first people to recognize the applied and decorative arts of rural America as collectible. Webb was an avid collector of American folk art and founded the museum in 1947. She took the step of relocating historic buildings from New England and New York to Shelburne in which to display the museum's holdings. The museum has lost money and was said to have had a deficit of more than $300,000 in 1994. Collections The core of the collection was formed by Electra Havemeyer Webb, a pioneering collector of American folk art who founded Shelburne Museum. Mrs. Webb exchanged ideas with other major early collectors, including Katherine Prentis Murphy, Henry and Helen Flynnt and Henry Francis du Pont (who founded the Winterthur Museum and credited Mrs. Webb with inspiring him to collect American decorative arts). Since Mrs. Webb's death in 1960, the collections have developed with an emphasis on folk art and contemporary art as it relates to the collection. Artifacts provide insight into the craftsmanship and artistic quality of objects made and used by three centuries of Americans. Visitors experience these objects in galleries and period rooms and through interactive exhibitions and demonstrations. Transportation, farming and trade artifacts illustrate America's industrial development from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. These collections are increasingly relevant to regional audiences from varied backgrounds as the economic base of the community shifts away from farming and small-scale production. Shelburne Museum's purpose is to enrich people's lives through art, history and culture. The collection of approximately 150,000 objects is one of the most extensive and varied collections in the US and is notable for its great range, quality and depth. The outstanding collections of fine, folk and decorative art celebrate American ingenuity, creativity and craftsmanship. Shelburne's folk art collection includes 1,400 wildfowl decoys and miniature carvings, 150 trade figures and signs, 120 weathervanes and 50 carousel figures, including all 40 animals from an early Dentzel carousel. The circus collection includes 600 historic posters, letters and memorabilia from P.T. Barnum, and the hand- carved 3,500 piece Kirk Brothers Miniature Circus. The Roy Arnold Circus Parade recreates in miniature 112 attractions from the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, Yankee Circus, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 525 linear feet of a special exhibition building.Shelburne Museum. 2001. American Folk Art at the Shelburne Museum, by Henry Joyce and Sloane Stephens Textiles include 770 bed coverings (including 500 quilts), 400 hooked and sewn rugs, early household textiles (1,800 samplers, laces and linens) and 2,800 costumes and accessories. The decorative arts collection has 6,650 pieces, including glass, ceramics, pewter, metalwork, scrimshaw and one of the country's best regional collections of 18th- and 19th-century painted furniture. Over 1,000 dolls, 27 dollhouses and 1,200 doll accessories echo in miniature the museum's collections of ceramics, furniture and other household furnishings. A major reinterpretation and related publication of the doll collection was completed in 2004. The collection of American and European toys dates from the beginning of the 19th century.Shelburne Museum. 2004. The Dolls of Shelburne Museum, by Jean M. Burks At the museum there are some 3,200 American prints, paintings, drawings and graphics that relate to daily life. American paintings include works by Bierstadt, Cassatt, Chase, Copley, Heade, Homer, Eastman Johnson, Lane, Grandma Moses, Peto and Andrew Wyeth. A significant group of European paintings and pastels from the renowned Havemeyer collection includes works by Corot, Daubigny, Degas, Manet and Monet; they are exhibited in furnished rooms re-created from the Webbs' New York apartment, c. 1930, and are the only Impressionism pictures on public view in Vermont.Shelburne Museum. 1976. Paintings and Drawing at the Shelburne Museum, by Nancy c.

Horse-Drawn Vehicles at the Shelburne Museum, by Kenneth Edward Wheeling 1,000 farming implements; and 5,000 hand tools that document woodworking, metalsmithing, coopering, weaving and spinning, leatherworking and woodcarving trades. Craftspeople staff working exhibits of blacksmithing, printing, spinning and weaving. An apothecary shop/physician's office displays 2,000 patent medicines and turn of the 20th century medical instruments. Front view of the Ticonderoga (steamboat) at Shelburne Museum The collections are exhibited in a setting of 38 exhibition buildings, 25 of which were relocated to the museum; the 1871 Colchester Reef Light; three historic and three replica barns, including a 1901 Vermont round barn; a vintage operating carousel; blacksmith and wheelwright shops; a weaving shop with an operating Jacquard loom; a working exhibit of late 19th-century printing equipment; an 1840 one-room schoolhouse; an 1890 Vermont slate jail; an 1840 general store; a rare 18th- century up-and-down sawmill; a 19th-century covered bridge with two lanes and a footpath; the reconstructed office of noted Vermont physician D. C. Jarvis; an 1890 railroad station; a 1914 steam locomotive and 1890 private rail car; and the 1906 steamboat Ticonderoga, which is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. Sale of art In 1996 the museum sold $30 million of its art to pay expenses. J. Watson Webb, Jr., the son of Electra Havemeyer Webb, resigned in protest. Webb believed that the sale violated the code of ethics of the American Alliance of Museums, which forbids the selling of artworks for purposes other than acquiring more art. The funds from the sale were used to establish a Collections Care Endowment which is used to support the ongoing remedial and preventative conservation, storage and management of the museum's collection.

Early life and education  Lesego Rampolokeng was born in 1965 in Orlando West, Soweto, Johannesburg. He studied law at the University of the North in South Africa, but he has not followed this path any further.\\"Rap-Master in the extreme\\" ‚Äîbiography of Lesego Rampolokeng on Culturebase.  Works  Lesego Rampolokeng came to prominence in the 1980s, a very turbulent time in South Africa. He was born and bred in Soweto:\\"I was born in Orlando West. Bred thorough all across Soweto. Orlando East, White City, Chiawelo, Meadowlands, Diepkloof. I schooled in Jabavu, Moroka, Jabulani‚Ä¶ \\" (Bird Monk Seding p20) His poetry stands aside from politics and is savagely critical of the (post)apartheid establishment. His first two books were published by the Congress of South African Writers (COSAW) Horns for Hondo (1991) and Talking Rain (1993). Rampolokeng has collaborated with various musicians on stage and in the studio. He has performed in many countries and with musicians such as Julian Bahula, Soulemane Toure, Louis Mhlanga and Gunther Sommer. He collaborated with the Kalahari Surfers on the Shifty Records album End Beginnings (vinyl, cassette and CD:1990) and the Bandcamp release: Bantu Rejex (2017) . Live performances with Kalahari Surfers include: (i) The Festival PoesieBH‚Äô94 _Brazil (1994) poetry festival in Belo Horizonte, Brazil (ii)'Sinner and Saint' concerts with Louis Mhlanga (Music ye Afrika), Vusi Mahlasela and Duncan Senyatso (Kgwanyape Band) at Angouleme in France.

National Gallery, Cape Town (2009) He is directly influenced by the writings of Frantz Fanon and he comes from the Black Consciousness era of the 1970s and 1980s. He is influenced by Ingoapele Madingoane, Matsemela Manaka and Maishe Maponya.These are the writers that he singles out in his interview with Y-Fm, a youth radio station in Johannesburg. This interview is in his CD H.A.L.F Ranthology. Ingoapele Madingoane, in particular, had an immense influence on Rampolokeng becoming a writer. He is a PhD candidate at Rhodes University working on a thesis about Mafika Gwala. Controversially he is also a fan of the writings of Herman Charles Bosman and even moved to Groot Marico to imbibe the spirit of the man. (this explained in a live radio interview for 'Mushroom Hour') In one of his poems, he claimed to \\"shoot the English with bullets that are British\\". In another piece of work, \\"Riding the Victim's Train\\" (on the CD/album The H.a.l.f Ranthology), Rampolokeng calls himself \\"a leper cast out in the desert, and cold, without a snout or paw in the pot of gold\\". He has shared a stage with local and international poets including Kgafela oa Magogodi, Lefifi Tladi, Lebo Mashile and Natalia Molebatsi. Some academics and critics have compared Rampolokeng to the late Dambudzo Marechera because of his non-complacent and often confrontational writing.Flora Veit-Wild, \\"Carnival and hybridity in texts by Dambudzo Marechera and Lesego Rampolokeng\\", Journal of Southern African Studies 23(4):553-564, December 1997.

The text is a noteworthy resource on folklore, as a century after its initial publication Fearsome Creatures remains one of the principal sources on legendary creatures of the United States and Canada.Dorson, Richard M. Man and Beast in American Comic Legend. (Bloomington, IN: Indiana Univ. Press, 1982.) Summary The book presents various sketches of fearsome critters from North American folklore, with descriptions by Cox preceded by full-page landscape illustrations by du Bois. Like in a traditional field guide, each animal is assigned a Latin classification (by Sudworth), afterward noting their habitat, physical makeup, and behavior. At the end of each account; however, there is usually a brief anecdote detailing an encounter with the creature. Fearsome Creatures may be classified as a work of metafiction. The introduction acknowledges the varmints as, \\"animals which he [the lumberjack] has originated\\". Although, given the books mixed field-guide narrative format it is uncertain whether the introduction is within or aside from the primary context. At times the storyteller (identified as Cox himself in the introduction) employs the more ambiguous woodsmen/loggers \\"tell of\\" or out comes the \\"rumor of\\", but other times declares to the reader that there \\"ranges\\" or \\"is\\" such a creature. Synopsis The squonk as illustrated by Coert Du Bois. Page 5 ‚Äì Introduction: Cox imparts that lumberjack yarns were carried from camp to camp. Also that while much has been written concerning lumberjacks, little has been put down concerning the creatures of his imagination.

Page 11 ‚Äì The Gumberoo: A nearly hairless, bear-like brute of the Pacific coast. The creature is purported to have a rubbery hide that bounces back anything thrown on it. Bullets will rebound in the direction they were fired. They can be killed when forest fires cause them to explode, leaving behind a rubbery smell. Page 13 ‚Äì The Roperite: A flightless bird of the Sierra Nevadas, that ropes in its prey with a lasso-like beak. Page 15 ‚Äì The Snoligoster: An enormous crocodilian monster of the southern cypress swamps. Being absent of any limbs the creature drives itself through the marsh aided by its propeller tipped tail. The snoligoster was spared from gun fire by a certain Inman F. Eldredge after it impaled a fugitive he had been tracking.

Page 21 ‚Äì The Slide-Rock Bolter: An appendageless leviathan, save for two claw-like hooks, that grapples itself atop Colorado slopes awaiting anything at the bottom, where after the hungry creature skids down the incline with its jaws wide open. After the consumption of its prey, the momentum it gained while traveling down the slope will carry it to a new one. Page 23 ‚Äì The Toteroad Shagamaw: A northeastern, bipedal beast with both hooves and paws that causes much confusion by swapping the two. While traveling it leaves behind tracks that abruptly switch from a moose, to a bear, and vice versa. Page 25 ‚Äì The Wapaloosie: A petite varmint of the northwest distinguished by its ability to scale substantial heights; an ability it retains even after being made into a pair of mittens. Page 27 ‚Äì The Cactus cat: A southwestern feline having a coat resembling thorns and a tail like branches; notorious for its fondness for fermented cactus juice (which it greedily gulps down.) The cat then becomes intoxicated and goes shrieking into the night. Page 29 ‚Äì The Hodag: A large animal ranging from Wisconsin to Minnesota having a spade-shaped bony growth at end of its nose. It uses this growth to level trees containing its natural prey, porcupine.

Publication history First published in 1910 by the Press of Judd & Detweiler, Inc., Fearsome Creatures wasn't reprinted until half a century later when the full manuscript was included as a bonus in Walker D. Wyman's Mythical Creatures of the North Country. (River Falls, Wis., River Falls State University Press, 1969.) It was published on its own again by Bishop Publishing Co. in 1984. The following year it was again put into hard- copy by Kessinger Publishing. The original edition is in 35 United States WorldCat libraries. Additionally, excerpts from Fearsome Creatures have been featured in a number of other publications, including: * Tryon, Henry Harrington. Fearsome Critters.

In the tradition of American tall tales and folklore, not all of the narrations are complete fabrications. Instead they are highly embellished stories elaborated on personal experiences. In the narrative of Hyampom Hog Bear, a hog bear cub is found in Klamath River, California and taken by Eugene S. Bruce to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. This account is also recorded in The Land We Live In, The Book of Conservation by Overton W. Price. In this version Bruce did in fact catch a cub with his bare hands while trekking through the California mountains; the accompanying image stating underneath, \\"It [the bear] is now in the Washington Zoo, albeit the animal pictured is presumably not a hog bear. Likewise, in the sketch of the snoligoster there is a reference to Inman F. Eldredge (1883‚Äì1963), a Gifford Pinchot Medal awardee, who while pursuing an escaped fugitive in the everglades, encounters the dreadful swamp-wyrm which afterward devours the criminal. An episode which is doubtlessly a fanciful idealization of Eldredge's background as a timber cruiser in Southern Florida. Other persons referenced in Fearsome Creatures are John P.

Hara was the only IJN destroyer captain at the start of World War II to survive the entire war and his memoirs serve as an important source for historians. Early life Tameichi Hara was born on October 16, 1900 in a suburb of Takamatsu City on the island of Shikoku. A native of Kagawa Prefecture and of samurai descent, Hara graduated with the 49th class from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima in 1921. In 1932 Hara was assigned as a surface warfare instructor and wrote a torpedo attack manual that was accepted as official doctrine. He began the war as the captain of destroyer . Military career Amatsukaze (center bottom), under Hara's command, maneuvers at high speed to evade a high-level bomb attack by B-17 bombers on the disabled Japanese aircraft carrier (center right) during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. Hara commanded a Japanese destroyer or destroyer division in many significant Pacific sea battles. As captain of the Amatsukaze Commander Hara participated in the Battle of the Java Sea, the sinking of the submarine and the occupation of Christmas Island.Hara, pp. 69-83 He claimed to have sank another submarine after detecting it at night when he saw a sailor on the surface light a cigarette four kilometers away.Hara, p. On 13 November 1942 Hara‚Äôs Amatsukaze sank the during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal but was severely damaged in turn after Hara left his searchlights on too long and drew intense fire from light cruiser .Hara, pp. 140-144 Hara, as told in his memoirs, was a Christian and refused to let his men mistreat American prisoners. After Amatsukaze returned to Japan for repairs Hara was promoted to captain and given the command of Destroyer Division 27, flying his flag aboard . While this was technically a four-ship formation the demands on the Imperial navy were such that Hara's ships rarely operated together. While serving aboard Shigure, Hara was involved in several fierce naval engagements during the latter part of the Solomon Islands Campaign. While on a re-supply mission through Blackett Straight on 2 August 1943, Hara noticed a fireball exploding near leading destroyer Amagiri and ordered Shigure's crew to shoot at the burning wreckage of Lt. John F. Kennedy's Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109.Hara, p. 171 During the Battle of Vella Gulf on 6‚Äì7 August Shigure was the only one of four Japanese destroyers to escape, though she was later found to have been hit by a torpedo that failed to explode. Although undamaged in the Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943), Shigure was ordered to back to Sasebo for a long overdue refit. Hara was relieved of his command and reassigned as senior torpedo instructor at the Naval Torpedo School at Oppama near Yokosuka to teach students in the Imperial Japanese Navy's belated Motor Torpedo Boat program.Hara, p. 144 Hara was quickly frustrated with the lack of effective equipment as well as the lack of leadership in the navy and army. He hastily wrote a letter intended for Emperor Hirohito urging him to fire the heads of the army and navy and seek peace as the war was lost and hand delivered it to Hirohito's younger brother Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu at the Navy Ministry. Despite the potentially grave consequences of this action Hara did not hear anything further on the matter.Hara, p. 251 Hara's last sortie was as captain of the light cruiser as flagship of the destroyer screen accompanying on her fateful last mission as part of Operation Ten-Go. He ended the war at Kawatana training Japanese sailors to operate Shinyo suicide boats, where he witnessed firsthand the effects of the second atomic bombing. During the war Captain Hara participated in thirteen major actions: * Air raid against American naval base at Davao on Mindanao (Philippines), 8 December 1941, escorting aircraft carrier Ry≈´j≈ç; a complete fiasco, as no American ships were found (on Amatsukaze) * Invasion of Davao on 20 December 1941, an easy Japanese victory, as the base was already almost completely evacuated (on Amatsukaze) * Invasion of Ambon Island, 30 January-3 February 1942, a Japanese victory (on Amatsukaze) * Battle of the Java Sea, 27‚Äì28 February 1942, a great Japanese victory (on Amatsukaze) * Invasion of Christmas Island, 31 March 1942, an easy Japanese victory as British garrison surrendered without resistance (on Amatsukaze) * Battle of the Eastern Solomons, 24‚Äì25 August 1942, a serious Japanese defeat (on Amatsukaze) * Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, 26 October 1942, a costly Japanese victory (on Amatsukaze) * Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November 1942, a Japanese tactical victory but a very serious strategic defeat (on Amatsukaze) * Battle of Vella Gulf, 6‚Äì7 August 1943, a crushing Japanese defeat (on Shigure) * Battle off Horaniu, 17 August 1943, inconclusive (on Shigure) * Battle of Vella Lavella, 6 October 1943, the last Japanese naval victory of the war (on Shigure) * Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, 1‚Äì2 November 1943, a heavy Japanese defeat (on Shigure) * Operation Ten-Go, 7 April 1945, a crushing Japanese defeat (on Yahagi) List of Victories:Japanese Destroyer Captain, Captain Tameichi Hara, Ballatine Books, 1961. *, US submarine damaged by Hara's destroyer Amatsukaze, and which was soon sunk by other Japanese destroyers. 2 March 1942, Java Sea. *, US destroyer sunk by Amatsukaze in torpedo attack during the Battle of Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942. *, US light cruiser damaged by a torpedo from Amatsukaze, and sunk the next day by submarine I-26 as Juneau limped back to base. Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November 1942. *, US destroyer severely damaged and put out of action for six months by torpedoes fired by destroyers Shigure and Samidare under Hara's command. Battle of Vella LaVella, 6‚Äì7 October 1943. Approximately ten US, British, and Australian aircraft were shot down by the destroyer Shigure and light cruiser Yahagi while under Hara's command, though not all of these claims are verified by Allied sources. Later life and memoirs Postwar Hara commanded merchant ships which transported salt. Hara was the only IJN destroyer captain at the start of World War II who survived the war. This left him the sole surviving witness to several important meetings and conferences which he recounted in his memoirs. Hara's memoirs were translated into English and French and became an important reference for the Japanese perspective for historians writing about the Pacific Campaign of World War II. In his memoir, Hara objects to compulsory suicide as official doctrine, which he saw as a violation of bushido values. His personal doctrines demonstrate why he survived the war and the Japanese lost it ‚Äî- they were inflexible, and he was not. His doctrines were \\"Never ever do the same thing twice\\" and \\"If he hits you high, then hit him low; if he hits you low, then hit him high,\\" the latter was also a maxim of Douglas MacArthur's. Hara criticizes his superiors for using cavalry tactics to fight naval battles; never understanding the implications of air power; dividing their forces in the face of enemy forces of unknown strength; basing tactics on what they thought their enemy would do; failing to appreciate the speed with which the enemy could develop new weapons and accepting a war of attrition with a foe more capable of maintaining it. Personal life Hara had three children with his wife Chizu: two daughters Keiko and Yoko, and a son, Mikito, who was born shortly before the start of hostilities.

He was born in York, Upper Canada in 1798, the son of John Small. He attended the Home District School with Robert Baldwin. During the War of 1812, he served on the ship St. Lawrence. In 1817, he was the second for John Ridout in a duel with Samuel Peters Jarvis; Ridout was killed. Small articled in law with William Warren Baldwin and was called to the bar in 1821. In 1831 Small and his younger brother, Charles Coxwell Small, inherited their father's large house on the southwest corner of what is now Berkeley and King streets. In 1834, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in Toronto. He was elected in an 1839 by-election in the 3rd riding of York; he was reelected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1841. Small supported Robert Baldwin's call for responsible government; in 1842, he was named solicitor general for Canada West in the Baldwin-Lafontaine government. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1842. He resigned from his post as solicitor general in 1843. He was reelected in 1844 but was later disqualified and George Monro was declared elected. In 1849, he was appointed judge in Middlesex County. He died in London, Ontario in 1869.

Uses Diosmin is a dietary supplement used to aid treatment of hemorrhoids and venous diseases, i.e., chronic venous insufficiency including spider and varicose veins, leg swelling (edema), stasis dermatitis and venous ulcers. The mechanism of action of Diosmin and other phlebotonics is undefined, and clinical evidence of benefit is limited. Diosmin is not recommended for treating the rectal mucosa, skin irritations, or wounds, and should not be used to treat dermatitis, eczema, or urticaria. Diosmin is not recommended for use in children or women during pregnancy. =Phlebotonics= Diosmin is included among a small class of agents called \\"phlebotonics\\" having heterogeneous composition and consisting partly of citrus peel extracts (flavonoids, such as hesperidin) and synthetic compounds, which are used to treat chronic venous insufficiency or hemorrhoids. A 2016 Cochrane review found only moderate-quality evidence that diosmin or other phlebotonics improved leg and ankle swelling and lower leg pain, and a 2012 review indicated low-quality evidence for treating hemorrhoids. In 2017, the American Working Group in Chronic Venous Disease recommended use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction (diosmiplex) as a medical food for chronic venous disease symptoms and venous ulcers, having \\"beneficial outcomes without serious adverse events\\", alone or combined with compression therapy, concurring with the previous guidance of the International European Society for Vascular Surgery. The German Dermatological Society indicated that Diosmin may be used with other treatments for symptoms of chronic venous diseases. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons mentions phlebotonics as a possible treatment for symptoms of hemorrhoid grades I to II, as there is only moderate-quality evidence of effectiveness with \\"expectations of minimal harm\\", while having no evidence of long-term benefit. French, Indian, Portuguese, and Italian professional societies of coloproctology issued similar recommendations regarding phlebotonics for hemorrhoids. Adverse effects In some 10% of users, diosmin causes mild gastrointestinal disorders or skin irritations (hives, itching), stomach pain, nausea, heart arrhythmias, or anemia. Preliminary research indicates no evidence of toxicity. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded in 2001 that there was inadequate evidence on which to base an expectation of safety.New Dietary Ingredients in Dietary Supplements, U. S.

Maria was one of las tres de Torena, \\"the three of Turenne\\", the three daughters of viscount Raymond II of Turenne and of Elise de S√©verac. These three, according to Bertran de Born, possessed tota beltat terrena, \\"all earthly beauty\\". Her date of birth is uncertain; she possibly died in 1222. Her name is variously recorded as Marie de Turenne and Marguerite de Turenne. She married viscount Eble V of Ventadour (Corr√®ze, France); they had a son, Eble (V), who married Dauphine de la Tour d'Auvergne, and a daughter, Alix or Alasia. Maria's husband was the grandson of Eble III (patron of the important early troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn), and the great-grandson of Eble le chanteur, believed to have been among the creators of the genre. Maria is addressed, or at least mentioned, in the work of several troubadours including Gaucelm Faidit, the Monk of Montaudon, Gausbert de Puicibot, Pons de Capduelh, Guiraut de Calanso, Bertran de Born and Gui d'Ussel. According to a poetic commentary included in the Biographies des Troubadours, Hugh IX of Lusignan was Maria's \\"knight\\" (). Maria de Ventadorn is listed as a trobairitz in her own right on the strength of a single tens√≥ or poetic debate (dated c. 1197), of which alternate verses were apparently composed by her and by Gui d'Ussel. The question at issue in the debate was this: once a man has succeeded in his plea to be accepted as a lady's lover, does he thereafter become her equal, or does he remain her servant? Maria takes the latter view.  References  * Biographies des troubadours ed. J. Bouti√®re, A.-H.

The Blackburn Brook is a stream in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England which flows through the Blackburn Valley along the M1 and Ecclesfield Road and joins the River Don near the Meadowhall shopping centre. Downstream from the A61 road at Chapeltown the Blackburn Brook is defined as a main river by the Environment Agency, which requires new building development to be at least 8m from the bank side as a flood defence measure and to allow access to the watercourse for maintenance. History Between Blackburn village and Grange Lane the brook originally formed the boundary between Sheffield and Rotherham. It is joined by Hartley Brook Dike (known as Sheffield Lane Dike and Tongue Gutter along part of its course), near the junction of Ecclesfield Road and Sicey Avenue. With the coming of the South Yorkshire Railway in the 1850s the course of the brook was straightened to run parallel with the trackbed through the valley, however the boundary continued to follow the original course. It runs in a culvert along part of the course by the railway line, which is now closed and forms part of the route of the north‚Äìsouth section of the Trans Pennine Trail alongside the brook. Water Power The brook provided power for a number of mills along its course, including the New Mill and the Old Mill at Ecclesfield. To the East of the confluence of the Hartley Brook Dike the Blackburn Brook was dammed to provide power for the Gibraltar Steel Works and further downstream, to the East of Grange Lane a mill race fed a dam (the local term for a body of water behind a dam wall) at Grange Mill. At Blackburn village the brook powered the Blackburn Wheel (charcoal works), close to the present day Royal Oak public house. There was a power station that once stood near the confluence of the Blackburn and the Don called Blackburn Meadows Power Station. The power station is no longer in use but both cooling towers could be seen next to the Tinsley Viaduct until 24 August 2008, when they were demolished, scuppering alternative plans to use them as a public art installation. 2007 United Kingdom floods Water levels are monitored by the Blackburn Brook at Sheffield Wincobank gauging station. The normal range for this location is between -0.02 metres and 0.42 metres. During the 2007 United Kingdom floods the level recorded by this station was 2.41 m. The brook to burst its banks at the entrance to Chapeltown Park, and where the stream flows under the A629 Cowley Lane. Many properties on Cowley Lane and Falding Street were flooded and a local schoolboy had to be rescued from fast flowing waters after falling into the stream.Yorkshire Post, 16 June 2007  Flood defence scheme  In September 2014 Sheffield City Council announced plans to create a ¬£2 million flood alleviation programme on the Blackburn Brook to protect 233 houses.

There are no subspecies which are currently recognized as being valid.

The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Montatheris hindii, p. 124). Description Montatheris hindii is a small species reaching an average total length (including tail) of and a maximum total length of about . The head is elongated and not very distinct from the neck, while the eyes are small and set in a rather forwards position. The dorsal scales are strongly keeled. Geographic range Montatheris hindii is known only from isolated populations at high altitudes on Mount Kenya and the moorlands of the Kinangop Plateau, Aberdare Mountains. The type locality listed is \\"Fort Hall, Kenya District, 4000 ft.\\". Since Fort Hall is at an altitude of only 4000 feet (1219 m), Loveridge (1957) questioned whether this was accurate. Habitat Montatheris hindii occurs at high altitudes of in treeless moorlands. It favors clumps of bunch grass for cover. Behavior A terrestrial species, because of the low nighttime temperatures in its native habitat, M. hindii is only active during the day and when there is enough sunlight to warm its environment. Feeding Montatheris hindii feeds on chameleons, skinks, and small frogs. It may also take small rodents.Spawls S, Howell K, Drewes R, Ashe J (2004). A Field Guide To The Reptiles Of East Africa. London: A & C Black Publishers Ltd. 543 pp. . Reproduction This species M. hindii is apparently viviparous (ovoviviparous). One wild-caught female produced two young in late January, while another gave birth to three in May. The total length of each newborn was .

History Midd-West School District was founded in 1970 after the merger of the former West Snyder Area and Middleburg Area School Districts. Two high schools had been maintained despite declining enrollment and significant fiscal challenges. In the 2004-2005 school year, Middleburg High School and West Snyder High School were united to form Midd- West High School.Brown, Melissa, \\"Midd-West board approves consolidation plan\\", Daily Item. February 24, 2004 The Midd-West School Board voted to realign the District in response to declining enrollment and education program changes, closing 2 elementary schools, at the end of the 2011-12 school year. Midd-West School District operates Middleburg Elementary School, West Snyder Elementary school,Midd West Middle School, and Midd-West High School. Beaver Adams School and Penns Creek School were closed years ago. Having consolidated two elementary schools, in 2005 the District sold the Penns Creek and Beaver Adams elementary schools via public auction.The Daily Item, Midd-West to sell schools at public auction, October 25, 2004. A five-year employment contract was agreed upon with the District's teachers union in August 2004. In May 2016 the board and local teacher's union(MWEA)agreed on a 4-year contract in which 2 years were retroactive going back to 2014. Governance Midd-West School District is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Pennsylvania Public School Code 2010 The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act (renamed Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015) which mandates the district focus its resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The school board is required by state law to post a financial report on the district in its website by March of each school year. The superintendent and business manager are appointed by the school board. The Superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The Business Manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials are voting members of the School Board. The School Board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. These contracts must be in writing and are subject to public disclosure under the state's Right to Know Act. In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the Superintendent regarding renewal of the employment contract.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Pennsylvania School Code, 2013 The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a \\"C‚àí\\" for transparency based on a review of \\"What information can people find on their school district's website\\". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more. Pursuant to Act 141 of 2012 which amended the Pennsylvania School Code, all school districts that have hired superintendents on/after the fall of 2012 are required to develop objective performance standards and post them on the district's website. In November 2013, Wesley L. Knapp, M.ED ($113,850 in 2009) abruptly resigned his position in exchange for the Midd-West School Board dropping pending charges. The Board offered no explanation regarding the departure, however Knapp received a substantial cash payout ($60,682 plus another $10,000 to be paid over six months). The Board appointed Daphne Snook as acting Superintendent pending the hiring of a new superintendent. In April 2014, the Board suspended Daphne Snook pending the results of a criminal investigation into her reading School Board confidential emails. The Midd-West School Board approved $200 per day as salary for Donna Samuelson as Interim Superintendent starting April 15, 2014. In early May 2014, the Snyder County District Attorney, Michael Piecuch, reported his investigation found insufficient evidence to file criminal charges against Snook. Piecuch noted that Snook did access emails she was directed to not open, referring the matter as a District personnel issue. A citizen group filed a petition in Snyder County Court, to remove school board member and former board president, Nancy Kroh, alleging misconduct. Subsequently, two more petitions were filed with Snyder County Court, to remove Midd-West Board President Victor Abate and director Ronald Wilson for neglect of duty. In March 2014, School Board member Scott Norman resigned after three months on the Midd-West School Board. He had sought to the post in 2013. In June 2014, the petitions to remove Board members: Abate and Wilson were dismissed by Snyder County Judge Michael T. Hudock.

The Midd-West School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 25 credits to graduate, including: a required class every year in math, English, social studies, science, Physical Education and electives. To be eligible to graduate, students in grades 9 through 12 shall successfully complete a minimum of 25 credits: three credits in mathematics that include algebra, geometry and one other math credit; three credits in science to include biology, chemistry, and physics; three credits in social studies that include world cultures, American cultures, and American government; four credits in English with a class taken each year; two classes in arts and/or humanities; one course in health education; a planned course in physical education for each year; and planned courses in approved electives as needed to meet the total number of credits required for graduation. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2020, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. In accordance with the State Board of Education regulations, students have several opportunities to pass the exams. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed House Bill 202, which makes modifications of the Keystone Exam mandates for students who attend VoTech and Career Tech schools. These pupils will be allowed to use alternate assessments or industry-based certifications. Curriculum and assessments The curriculum is under revision to align it with the 1999 Pennsylvania Academic Standards. These standards are assessed in the third through eighth grades and eleventh grades under the guise of the PSSAs. These tests cover critical skills in: reading, writing, speaking and mathematics. In 2007, science was added to the state's assessment protocol. Academic achievement In 2016, Midd-West School District ranked 341st out of 493 Pennsylvania public school districts, by the Pittsburgh Business Times. The ranking is based on the last 3 years of student academic achievement as demonstrated by PSSAs results in: reading, writing, math and science and the three Keystone Exams (literature, Algebra 1, Biology I) in high school. Three school districts were excluded because they do not operate high schools (Saint Clair Area School District, Midland Borough School District, Duquesne City School District). The PSSAs are given to all children in grades 3rd through 8th. Adapted PSSA examinations are given to children in the special education programs. Writing exams were given to children in 5th and 8th grades. *2015 - 316th *2014 - 313thPittsburgh Business Times, Pennsylvania Schools Guide 2014 Statewide Ranking, April 11, 2014 *2013 - 334thPittsburgh Business Times, Pennsylvania Schools Guide 2013 Statewide Ranking, April 5, 2013 *2012 - 371stPittsburgh Business Times, Statewide Honor Roll Rankings 2012, April 4, 2012 *2011 - 368thPittsburgh Business Times, Statewide Honor Roll Rankings 2011, April 2011 *2010 - 362ndPittsburgh Business Times, Statewide Honor Roll Ranking 2010, May 14, 2010 *2009 - 348th *2008 - 314th *2007 - 305th out of 501 Pennsylvania school districts. ;Overachievers ranking: In 2012, the Pittsburgh Business Times also reported an Overachievers Ranking for 498 Pennsylvania school districts.

This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth.

The funding was limited to the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Midd-West School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional funding for improving student academic achievement.

In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, Governor's Press Office release, January 20, 2010 Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. English language learners grant The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to assist in educating immigrant children and children who are identified as limited English proficient. Upon registering for school a language survey is done for all new enrollment pupils, typically in kindergarten or preschool. They identify the primary language spoken at home.

Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community, a county and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two or more counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties.State Tax Equalization Board, State Tax Equalization Board About US, 2011 In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2016-17 - 70.1120 mills *2015-16 - 70.1120 mills *2014-15 - 70.1120 mills *2013-14 - 70.1120 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Finances - Real Estate Taxes Report 2013-14, September 2013 *2012-13 - 66.5000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances - Real Estate Taxes Report 2012-13, September 2012 *2011-12 - 61.9500 mills. *2010-11 - 55.4500 mills. *2009-10 - 48.850 mills. *2008-09 - 47.300 mills *2006 through 2008, 63.5 mills. Snyder County set a new assessment ratio which increased from 75% to 100% of assessed value in 2007. The District adjusted the millage accordingly to be revenue neutral. *2005-06 - 63.5 mills.Laepple, G. Wayne \\"Midd-West won't raise taxes in 2006-07 budget\\", The Daily Item. April 26, 2006. The average yearly property tax paid by Snyder County residents amounts to about 2.79% of their yearly income. Snyder County is ranked 728th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Snyder County Property Taxes 2012, Tax rates.org, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

The company was founded in 1949 by Bernard Gantmacher and was originally based in New Haven, Connecticut. Gant operates in 70 markets and its products are available at over 4 000 retailers and Gant-stores all over the world. \\"House of Gant\\" has three different collections: GANT, GANT Diamond G and GANT Rugger.  History  Bernard Gantmacher arrived in New York City in 1907, a Jewish immigrant from Myropil, Ukraine. Gantmacher was employed at a garment factory sewing shirt collars and met his future wife, Rebecca Rose, a button and buttonhole specialist who worked for the same company. After Gantmacher's return from military service during World War I, the couple married and founded the Par-Ex Shirt Company with business partner Morris Shapiro. The company made shirts for brands including Brooks Brothers, J. Press and Manhattan. In 1927, the company was relocated to New Haven, Connecticut. In April 1949, the Gant label was launched. Following their father's death in 1955, Bernard's sons took over the company's operations. GANT dress shirts were known for their back-collar button, locker loop and box pleat. In the 1960s, Gant made the Yale co-op shirt exclusively for the store on the Yale University campus. In 1968, the Gant brothers sold the company to Consolidated Foods but remained with the company. In 1971, the company launched its first sportswear line and in 1974 launched its Rugger brand. In 1979, Gant became a subsidiary of apparel manufacturer The Palm Beach Company and ceased operations in New Haven. In the early 1980s, Gant entered the international market when Pyramid Sportswear of Sweden was given the right to design and market Gant outside the U.S. Initially, Pyramid only offered the Gant label in Sweden but quickly expanded internationally. In 1995, Phillips- Van Heusen acquired the Gant brand in the U.S. from bankrupt sportswear manufacturer, Crystal Brands, Inc. In 1997, Gant opened its first store in the United States. Phillips-Van Heusen sold its Gant operations in 1999 to Pyramid Sportswear of Sweden for $71 million. In the spring of 2006, Gant became a public company and was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange's O-List until it was delisted 20 March 2008 upon being acquired by the Swiss retail group Maus Fr√®res. In November 2010, Gant returned to New Haven, where it opened a retail store. In 1995 the first Gant store opened in Europe in Amsterdam by owner Robert Staneke in the museumquarter. This location opened on the 25th of February 1995 and is currently the oldest Gant store in the world.

Drop attacks stem from diverse mechanisms, including orthopedic causes (for example, leg weakness and knee instability), hemodynamic causes (for example, transient vertebrobasilar insufficiency, a type of interruption of blood flow to the brain), and neurologic causes (such as epileptic seizures or unstable vestibular function), among other reasons. Those afflicted typically experience abrupt leg weakness, sometimes after sudden movement of the head. The weakness may persist for hours. The term \\"drop attack\\" is used to categorize otherwise unexplained falls from a wide variety of causes and is considered ambiguous medical terminology; drop attacks are currently reported much less often than in the past, possibly as a result of better diagnostic precision. By definition, drop attacks exclude syncopal falls (fainting), which involve short loss of consciousness. In neurology, the term \\"drop attack\\" is used to describe certain types of seizure which occur in epilepsy. Drop attacks that have a vestibular origin within the inner ear may be experienced by some people in the later stages of M√©ni√®re's disease (these may be referred to as Tumarkin [drop] attacks, or as Tumarkin's otolithic crisis). Drop attacks often occur in elderly people.

It is named after James Durbin and Geoffrey Watson. The small sample distribution of this ratio was derived by John von Neumann (von Neumann, 1941). Durbin and Watson (1950, 1951) applied this statistic to the residuals from least squares regressions, and developed bounds tests for the null hypothesis that the errors are serially uncorrelated against the alternative that they follow a first order autoregressive process. Later, John Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava developed several von Neumann‚ÄìDurbin‚ÄìWatson type test statistics for the null hypothesis that the errors on a regression model follow a process with a unit root against the alternative hypothesis that the errors follow a stationary first order autoregression (Sargan and Bhargava, 1983). Note that the distribution of this test statistic does not depend on the estimated regression coefficients and the variance of the errors. A similar assessment can be also carried out with the Breusch‚ÄìGodfrey test and the Ljung‚ÄìBox test. Computing and interpreting the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic If et is the residual given by e_t = \\\\rho e_{t-1}+ u_t , Durbin -Watson statistic states that null hypothesis: \\\\rho =0 , alternative hypothesis \\\\rho e 0, then the test statistic is : d = {\\\\sum_{t=2}^T (e_t - e_{t-1})^2 \\\\over {\\\\sum_{t=1}^T e_t^2}}, where T is the number of observations. If one has a lengthy sample, then this can be linearly mapped to the Pearson correlation of the time-series data with its lags. Since d is approximately equal to 2(1 ‚àí \\\\hat \\\\rho), where \\\\hat \\\\rho is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals,Gujarati (2003) p. 469 d = 2 indicates no autocorrelation. The value of d always lies between 0 and 4. If the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic is substantially less than 2, there is evidence of positive serial correlation. As a rough rule of thumb, if Durbin‚ÄìWatson is less than 1.0, there may be cause for alarm. Small values of d indicate successive error terms are positively correlated. If d > 2, successive error terms are negatively correlated. In regressions, this can imply an underestimation of the level of statistical significance. To test for positive autocorrelation at significance Œ±, the test statistic d is compared to lower and upper critical values (dL,Œ± and dU,Œ±): :*If d < dL,Œ±, there is statistical evidence that the error terms are positively autocorrelated. :*If d > dU,Œ±, there is no statistical evidence that the error terms are positively autocorrelated. :*If dL,Œ± < d < dU,Œ±, the test is inconclusive. Positive serial correlation is serial correlation in which a positive error for one observation increases the chances of a positive error for another observation. To test for negative autocorrelation at significance Œ±, the test statistic (4 ‚àí d) is compared to lower and upper critical values (dL,Œ± and dU,Œ±): :*If (4 ‚àí d) < dL,Œ±, there is statistical evidence that the error terms are negatively autocorrelated. :*If (4 ‚àí d) > dU,Œ±, there is no statistical evidence that the error terms are negatively autocorrelated. :*If dL,Œ± < (4 ‚àí d) < dU,Œ±, the test is inconclusive. Negative serial correlation implies that a positive error for one observation increases the chance of a negative error for another observation and a negative error for one observation increases the chances of a positive error for another. The critical values, dL,Œ± and dU,Œ±, vary by level of significance (Œ±) and the degrees of freedom in the regression equation. Their derivation is complex‚Äîstatisticians typically obtain them from the appendices of statistical texts. If the design matrix \\\\mathbf{X} of the regression is known, exact critical values for the distribution of d under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation can be calculated. Under the null hypothesis d is distributed as : \\\\frac {\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-k} u_i \\\\xi_i^2} {\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-k} \\\\xi_i^2}, where n are the number of observations and k the number of regression variables; the \\\\xi_i are independent standard normal random variables; and the u_i are the nonzero eigenvalues of ( \\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{X} ( \\\\mathbf{X}^T \\\\mathbf{X} ) ^{-1} \\\\mathbf{X}^T ) \\\\mathbf{A}, where \\\\mathbf{A} is the matrix that transforms the residuals into the d statistic, i.e. d = \\\\mathbf{e}^T\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{e}. . A number of computational algorithms for finding percentiles of this distribution are available. Although serial correlation does not affect the consistency of the estimated regression coefficients, it does affect our ability to conduct valid statistical tests. First, the F-statistic to test for overall significance of the regression may be inflated under positive serial correlation because the mean squared error (MSE) will tend to underestimate the population error variance. Second, positive serial correlation typically causes the ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors for the regression coefficients to underestimate the true standard errors. As a consequence, if positive serial correlation is present in the regression, standard linear regression analysis will typically lead us to compute artificially small standard errors for the regression coefficient. These small standard errors will cause the estimated t-statistic to be inflated, suggesting significance where perhaps there is none. The inflated t-statistic, may in turn, lead us to incorrectly reject null hypotheses, about population values of the parameters of the regression model more often than we would if the standard errors were correctly estimated. If the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic indicates the presence of serial correlation of the residuals, this can be remedied by using the Cochrane‚ÄìOrcutt procedure. The Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic, while displayed by many regression analysis programs, is not applicable in certain situations. For instance, when lagged dependent variables are included in the explanatory variables, then it is inappropriate to use this test. Durbin's h-test (see below) or likelihood ratio tests, that are valid in large samples, should be used. Durbin h-statistic The Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic is biased for autoregressive moving average models, so that autocorrelation is underestimated. But for large samples one can easily compute the unbiased normally distributed h-statistic: :h = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac {1} {2} d \\\\right) \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac {T} {1-T \\\\cdot \\\\widehat {\\\\operatorname{Var}}(\\\\widehat\\\\beta_1\\\\,)}}, using the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic d and the estimated variance : \\\\widehat{\\\\operatorname{Var}} (\\\\widehat\\\\beta_1) of the regression coefficient of the lagged dependent variable, provided : T \\\\cdot \\\\widehat{\\\\operatorname{Var}}(\\\\widehat\\\\beta_1)<1\\\\. \\\\, Durbin‚ÄìWatson test for panel data For panel data this statistic was generalized as follows by Alok Bhargava et al. (1982): :If ei, t is the residual from an OLS regression with fixed effects for each observational unit i, associated with the observation in panel i at time t, then the test statistic is :: d_{pd}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{t=2}^T (e_{i,t} - e_{i,t-1})^2} {\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{t=1}^T e_{i,t}^2}. This statistic can be compared with tabulated rejection values [see Alok Bhargava et al. (1982), page 537]. These values are calculated dependent on T (length of the balanced panel‚Äîtime periods the individuals were surveyed), K (number of regressors) and N (number of individuals in the panel). This test statistic can also be used for testing the null hypothesis of a unit root against stationary alternatives in fixed effects models using another set of bounds (Tables V and VI) tabulated by Alok Bhargava et al. (1982). A version of the statistic suitable for unbalanced panel data is given by Baltagi and Wu (1999).d1 in formula 16 in Baltagi/Wu (1999), Unequally spaced panel data regressions with AR(1) disturbances.

It is the remnant of a 700,000‚Äëyear‚Äëold volcano, mostly made of volcanic palagonite tuff, forming a massive rock fortress. The island was first mentioned in the Icelandic classic Grettis saga as being the refuge of the outlaw Grettir, who spent his last years there with his brother Illugi and his slave Glaumur. He fled there with his two companions when enemies were seeking his life because of its high, impervious cliffs. It is described as having a flock of 80 sheep, and many birds nesting on the cliffs. In late autumn of 1031, Grettir was assassinated where he lay virtually dying in his shed on the island. √ûorbj√∂rn √ñngull and his men were the perpetrators. An old legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \\"Old Hag\\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago. The bird life in Drangey is varied and lively, but the most common are diving birds: the guillemot, auk and puffin. The guillemot nests in the cliffs, while the auk mostly prefers deep cracks underneath the cliffs. The puffin, on the other hand, digs holes in the edge of the cliffs. In addition to these species, the black-legged kittiwake and fulmar nest in the cliffs and the raven and falcon also have their sanctuaries there. Drangey has for ages been a harbinger of spring for the local residents. Every spring, they visited the island to collect both eggs and birds. They used ropes to climb down the fowling cliffs for the eggs, but the birds were caught using rafts placed on the sea underneath the cliffs. These rafts were covered with bird snares made of horsehair. The bird catchers mostly found shelter in sheds on the beach on the southernmost tip of the island. From this point, they also used to go fishing in their boats. At peak seasonal periods, there were as many as 200 men engaged in fowling and the catch was in excess of 200,000 birds when the yield was best. The use of snares was discontinued in 1966.  In popular culture  The 2011 Icelandic film Stormland includes Drangey.

House has won the CMA ACM Billboard and Marconi awards for Personality of the Year numerous times. House is also a songwriter, who has written songs for George Strait (\\"The Big One\\"), Reba McEntire (\\"Little Rock\\"), LeAnn Rimes (\\"On the Side of Angels\\") and Pam Tillis (\\"The River and the Highway\\"). He has also had his songs recorded by Brad Paisley, Randy Travis, Trace Adkins, Mark Collie, Clint Black, Neal McCoy, The Oak Ridge Boys, and Big & Rich, among others. Family Gerry House was born in Independence, Kentucky, a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 28, 1948, to Lucille and Homer House. House married Allyson Faulkner in 1970 and has a daughter, Autumn House Tallant. Career Before moving to Nashville, House worked in Richmond, Kentucky, Ithaca, New York and Jacksonville, Florida. He first joined WSIX-AM in 1975. House had also begun to do stand-up comedy and was writing songs. In the early 1980s, WSIX-FM, a country music-formatted FM outlet, appointed House to host a new morning show. Al Voecks had presented a talk show on the AM station, and he soon became House's newsman. Duncan Stewart joined the cast as House's sports reporter, and Paul Randal began as a traffic reporter and eventually became House's co-presenter. The House Foundation was split up in 1985 when House left for a WSIX competitor, WSM-AM. After a short time at WSM, House was hired by KLAC in Los Angeles. House left KLAC and came back to WSIX-FM and continued with Gerry House and the House Foundation, with Voecks, Stewart and Randall, all in their original roles. Devon O'Day also joined the show as producer and for a country music news segment called \\"Twang Talk\\". House earned a record deal with MCA Records and released two country‚Äìcomedy albums, The Cheater's Telethon in 1990 and Bull in 1992. House also hosted several nationally syndicated radio shows, including Countryline USA, America's Number Ones and The Saturday Night House Party. When Paul Randall became very ill, Mike Bohan joined the show in 1995, after 20 years at WSM radio and WSMV television. Randall succumbed to his illness in 1998; Bohan continues with the show, while Richard Falklen now directs the show and hosts the news segment once named \\"Twang Talk\\". In addition House operates a music publishing company, House Notes, which owns the songs he has written. Some of his writing partners over the years have included O'Day, Gary Burr and Don Schlitz, who have all had number-one hits with House. In addition, House records the \\"Maurice\\" (a character he bought from Los Angeles) segments for his show in the House Notes studio, as well as voices such as \\"Makk Truck\\" and \\"Homer\\". House has contributed to Nick Barraclough's BBC Radio 2 country show, offering 'news from Nashville'. He also hosted Radio 2's coverage of the Country Music Association Awards with Barraclough in 2004. It was announced May 19, 2017, that House would return to the airwaves on WNRQ-FM, with Bohan, on May 26, 2017. Retirement On August 15, 2003, House was hospitalized after complaining of a severe headache. He was diagnosed with a bleeding artery and underwent surgery to repair it and underwent further surgery to relieve fluid and swelling on his brain. He made a full recovery. On September 3, 2010, House announced the dissolution of the House Foundation and that their December 15, 2010 broadcast would be their last.

The park is in a rugged bush environment, with a narrow gorge set with three waterfalls, bounded by steep ridges and cliffs. The park caters to many activities, including bushwalking, bird watching and rock climbing. History Giant's Cave John Smith Reid who was a landholder in the area, is reported as offering to donate part of his land in 1911 to create a national reserve. Reid donated in 1913. On 15 July 1915, the land was declared a National Pleasure Resort under the National Pleasure Resorts Act 1914 with the name, Morialta Falls Reserve. Much of the construction work in the National Pleasure Resort was begun in the 1920s and 1930s, although floods and bushfires have destroyed much of this original work. In 1966 additional property to the east was added. On 29 September 1966, a proclamation made under the Crown Lands Act 1929 resumed all of the land occupied by the National Pleasure Resort and then divided it into a reserve for \\"waterworks purposes\\" and a reserve with the name, the Morialta Falls National Pleasure Resort. On 27 April 1972, the national pleasure resort was reconstituted under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 as the Morialta Conservation Park. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. Major rebuilding was required after flooding in 1980, and flooding in November 2005 again caused damage to paths and walkways. Prior use of the land The land which now constitutes the Park was originally the land of the Kaurna people. Morialta is said by many to derive its name from a Kaurna word, moriatta, meaning \\"ever flowing\\" or \\"running water\\", however some linguists suggest it comes from the Kaurna words mari yertalla, meaning \\"eastern cascade\\".http://press.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ch182.pdf It is said that the area was used as a hunting ground, and to collect firewood, during the winter months when the Kaurna would retreat from the coast to the hills. It is also said that they practised fire-stick farming here. The area's religious significance appears to be lost to time. For in 1839, only three years after the proclamation of the British colony of South Australia in 1836, the area was granted by the new South Australian Government to pastoralists. In 1847, John Baker bought the land and built the grand Morialta House and Morialta Barns on Fourth Creek, near the head of the gorge. Geography and climate First Falls Second Falls Morialta Third Falls Morialta Conservation Park covers 5.33 km¬≤ within the Mount Lofty Ranges, which run north‚Äìsouth to the east of Adelaide's coastal plain. It is bounded by Black Hill Conservation Park on the north, Norton Summit road on the south, the suburb of Rostrevor on the west, and by agricultural land on the east. The park lies mostly on either side of Morialta Gorge, along the bottom of which runs Fourth Creek. There are three waterfalls on the creek, named respectively First, Second and Third Falls. The main access to the park is via the vehicle entrance off Morialta Road, and there is walking access at various points along Norton Summit Road. Morialta shares Adelaide's Mediterranean climate, with average temperatures of 17 degrees Celsius in winter, to 28 degrees during summer. The park receives average annual rainfall of 800 mm, mostly between May and September. During summer (December to February) temperatures can rise above 40 degrees. Activities The park caters for a variety of activities, including bushwalking, picnics, rock climbing and bird watching. There are many walking paths within the park. A project has recently finished, installing a large nature play area in the foot of the park. White Faced Heron in Morialta Conservation Park Rock Climbing Toproping Balthazar (12) near Boulder Bridge. Being only 10 km from the centre of Adelaide and having a large number of climbs, Morialta is one of the most popular rock climbing areas in South Australia.Pritchard 2002 p 175 The rock is quartzite, and there are heavy duty rings at the top of most routes to allow for easy top-roping.Neagle 1997, p41 There are several crags along both sides of the gorge. On the southern side, from the western end, there is Milestone Buttress, The Outcrops, The Buttress, Billiard Table, Boulder Bridge, Throne Room and Far Crag. On the northern side there is The Lost Walls and Thorn Buttress.Neagle 1997, p47 Far Crag is one of the more popular crags, with over 67 routes graded from 4 (Ewbanks) to 27. =History= The first climbing at Morialta was in 1962 by a group from the Adelaide University Mountain Club (AUMC). Four members of the club were given an introduction by the National Fitness Council of South Australia and began regular climbing at the site. Access at this time was from the western end of the park (the Adelaide side) and so the cliffs to the western end were climbed first. No documentation of the climbing occurred until 1968, when Far Crag was discovered. It was named such because it is the furthest from the western end and so had the longest walk to reach it.Neagle 1997, pp41-43 A large number of routes were put up at the park up until the 1970s. A visit by international climbers in 1971 saw the standards of free climbing increase at the park, with many new bold routes being led. The late-1970s saw grades at the park reach 25.Neagle 1997, p44 Remarkably, The Lost Walls were not discovered until 1986, hence their name and is the most recent addition of a significant number of climbs. 1994 saw the highest graded new route put up in the park, at 27.Neagle 1997, p45 Access is now from Norton Summit Road, on the southern side of the park. =Style of climbing= The highest volume of climbing in the gorge is done on top rope, which is made especially easy by the provision of regularly tested steel rings at the tops of many climbs. These rings greatly simplify the task of building an anchor, making outdoor climbing accessible to a broader range of people. Although most routes can be top-roped, there are routes which are bolted for sport climbing, or suitable for traditional climbing with natural gear, or a mixture of both. Often a route which is suitable for sport or traditional climbing can also be top-roped.

Description Restoration with hypothetical feathers. Marshosaurus was medium-sized for a theropod. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at and its weight at . The holotype ilium has a length of . If the cranial material is correctly referred, the skull was about long. In 2012, Matthew Carrano established one autapomorphy, a unique derived trait of the holotype: the suture between the pubic peduncle and the pubic bone is convex, curving upwards, at the front and concave at the rear. Discovery and naming Reconstructed skull of Marshosaurus at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, based on referred material During the 1960s, over fourteen thousand fossil bones were uncovered at the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry in central Utah. The majority of these belonged to Allosaurus but some were of at least two theropods new to science. In 1974 one of these was named by James Henry Madsen Jr. as the genus Stokesosaurus. In 1976 the second was by Madsen named as the type species Marshosaurus bicentesimus. The generic name honoured the nineteenth century paleontologist Professor Othniel Charles Marsh, who described many dinosaur fossils during the Bone Wars. The specific name was chosen \\"in honor of the bicentennial of the United States of America\\". The holotype, UMNH VP 6373, was found in a layer of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation dating from the late Kimmeridgian, approximately 155 - 152 mya. It is a left ilium, or upper pelvis bone. The paratypes consisted of three bones: the ischia UMNH VP 6379 and UMNH VP 380 and the pubic bone UMNH VP 6387. Three ilia and six jaw fragments were provisionally referred. The material represents at least three individuals. In 1991, Brooks Britt referred tail vertebrae from Colorado, because they resembled non-identified tail vertebrae fragments from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry. In 1993 a partial skeleton, CMNH 21704, from the Dinosaur National Monument was referred because its dorsal neural spines resembled non-identified spines from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry. This specimen was also the subject of a 1997 SVP abstract. Classification Ischium Madsen originally was unsure about the phylogenetic position of Marshosaurus, placing it as Theropoda incertae sedis. Some later analyses showed Marshosaurus to be a member of Avetheropoda, a group of more bird-like theropods including Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Allosaurus. However, Roger Benson (et al., 2009) found it to be a megalosauroid, using a lot of newly found characters of referred Megalosaurus specimens. The position of Marshosaurus in the evolutionary tree, as a possible member of the Piatnitzkysauridae, is shown by the cladogram below. Paleopathology One right ilium of a Marshosaurus bicentesimus is deformed by \\"an undescribed pathology\\" which probably originated as a consequence of injury. Another specimen has a pathological rib. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, five foot bones referred to Marshosaurus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found. Paleoecology =Habitat= The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, ranges between 156.3 million years old (Ma) at its base, to 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. In 1877 this formation became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil- collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. =Paleofauna= The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as Camarasaurus, Brachiosaurus, Barosaurus, Diplodocus, and Apatosaurus. Dinosaurs that lived alongside Marshosaurus included the herbivorous ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, Stegosaurus and Othnielosaurus. Predators in this paleoenvironment included the theropods Saurophaganax, Torvosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Stokesosaurus, Ornitholestes and Allosaurus, which accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Stegosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus. Early mammals were present in this region, such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.

In 2006 it hosted the Cypriot Cup final between APOEL and AEK Larnaca FC, where APOEL won 3‚Äì2. However the greatest event that was hosted in the Larnaca Stadium was the final for the 1998 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship between Republic of Ireland and Germany where they tied 1-1. The Republic of Ireland beat Germany 4‚Äì3 on penalties and won the trophy. During the same day, the Third Position final playoff was played for the same tournament and in that match Portugal beat Croatia 5‚Äì4 on penalties as well while the match ended 0-0.

Although its name identifies it as a small hadrosaur, it is based on juvenile remains, and the size of the adult hadrosaur is unknown. Description Dong Zhiming named this genus for IVPP V4732, a partial lower jaw from a juvenile hadrosaur. This partial bone, with 18 columns of stacked teeth in a typical hadrosaur tooth battery, measures 37 centimeters long (15 inches). Dong later estimated the length of the individual at 2.6 meters (8.5 feet). History Dong regarded this genus as much like Edmontosaurus, albeit in tiny form. However, Michael K. Brett-Surman, a hadrosaur specialist, regarded the material as showing no characteristics that would allow it to be differentiated from other duckbills. The most recent review accepts Brett- Surman's position, and regards Microhadrosaurus as a dubious name. Paleobiology As a hadrosaurid, Microhadrosaurus would have been a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing, and was furnished with hundreds of continually-replaced teeth. Because it is only known from a partial jaw from a juvenile, little more than general information can be drawn from it at this point. Paleoecology =Fauna and habitat= The Nanxiong Formation consists of a 2000-meter sequence of red sandstones and clays which has yielded dinosaur fossils, dinosaur footprints and abundant egg shells. Microhadrosaurus shared its paleoenvironment with the sauropod Gannansaurus, the therizinosauroid Nanshiungosaurus, the tyrannosaurid Qianzhousaurus and the oviraptorids Banji, Jiangxisaurus, Corythoraptor, Ganzhousaurus, Huanansaurus, Nankangia and Tongtianlong.

In the final decade of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I he became a leading hate figure in English government propaganda, but his lasting achievement was in the establishment of Irish seminaries in continental Europe as part of the counter reformation. Early life Archer came from an Anglo-Norman family in County Kilkenny. He may have attended the local grammar school Kilkenny College which had been established in 1555 under Peter White, a fellow of Oxford University. David Wolfe, papal nuncio to Ireland, had been evangelizing in south Leinster in this period, although there is no evidence that he came in contact with Archer. Archer entered the seminary college of Louvain around the year 1564, when Nicholas Sanders was in charge. In his maturity, he was described as tall, of dark complexion, with a long, thin face. Irish mission Archer took a degree of Master of Arts and returned to Ireland in March 1577. Later the same year his presence about Waterford and Clonmel was reported to the queen's secretary, Francis Walsingham, by the President of Munster, William Drury. In the report Archer was described as a \\"principal prelate\\" and \\"a detestable enemy to the Word of God\\". Drury also claimed that en route to Ireland Archer had \\"taught all the way betwixt Rye and Bristol [in England] against our religion and caused a number to despair\\". In 1579, the rebel James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald landed a papal invasion force at Smerwick in modern-day County Kerry in the company of Sanders. Fitzmaurice proceeded to Holy Cross in County Tipperary via Kilmallock, and it is possible that Archer, who was in the vicinity, was attached to his forces. Fitzmaurice was killed during this journey. At about this time Archer is said to have attended on the rebel Conor O'Rourke on the evening of the latter's execution for treason. One source asserts that he was imprisoned at Westminster sometime after, but there is no substantial evidence for this. Jesuit Archer was received as a novice into the Society of Jesus at Rome in 1581. He then spent two and a half years at the Roman College, studying logic, physics, and moral and controversial theology. In a report to the Jesuit General in 1584 he was described as physically strong, although choleric and melancholy in temperament; he had not distinguished himself in his studies, and was reckoned, \\"suitable to hear confessions\\". In 1585 Archer was sent to the University of Pont-√†-Mousson, where a Scots-Irish seminary had lately been established. He studied scholastic theology for two years while ministering to the students and hearing confessions. In an unenthusiastic report delivered in 1587 - describing him as \\"bilious\\" - it was suggested that he was suited to become a preacher in his native country. Low Countries In 1587 Archer was sent to the Low Countries to serve as chaplain to the Spanish forces under the Duke of Parma during the Anglo-Spanish war (1585‚Äì1604). McCoog p.105William Stanley, commander of a regiment of Irish soldiers under English crown authority, had just surrendered the Belgian city of Deventer to Parma and committed himself and his men to the service of the Spanish king. Archer spent his time hearing confessions from the Irish soldiers and busying himself in administrative duties. Expectations ran high among the forces for an invasion of England, but were defeated in the following year when the Spanish Armada was driven from the Dutch coast. As Spain gradually regained its strategic initiative over England, Archer was reported to be following Stanley's regiment throughout 1590. In September of the following year he was at Brussels, recovering from an illness. His superiors still considered him of middling ability, and the impression of melancholy and irascibility persisted. A request was then received from the Archbishop of Armagh, Edmund MacGauran, for his participation in a Jesuit mission to Ireland.McCoog p.87 Salamanca Archer remained in the Low Countries throughout 1591, then spent three months at Calais before he sailed to Spain, where he became the first rector of the Irish college at Salamanca after a visit to Philip II's court at Madrid. In the following years he visited court regularly in an effort to secure scarce funding for the institution. By this time his superiors had altered their opinion of him to such a degree that he was considered ripe for promotion.McCoog p.238 Plots and allegations In 1594 Archer became involved in controversy, when it was alleged that he had plotted two years previously with other Jesuits and Stanley to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I. The chosen assassin had been Hugh Cahill, a Tipperary man, who confessed that he was paid to hang about the court at London, on the off chance that the queen might present herself as a target, and then stab her. The confession had been obtained under torture by Richard Topcliffe, and further information came from an agent of Robert Cecil, secretary to the queen. At this time, Archer was also implicated in a plot to torch the French and English ships at Dieppe. The merits of the allegations are impossible to judge, although it seems clear that Archer was acquainted with Cahill. The assassination plot was just one of many against the queen that received credence during the final decade of her reign. One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England. The book does appear to have alarmed Elizabeth's advisers, and from that date onward the flow of supposed plots against the queen's life became steady. In 1601 Cecil himself was accused of treason at the trial of the Earl of Essex on the basis of his reading of Person's book, but survived this twist and went on to secure the succession of James I upon the queen's death two years later. Ireland In 1596 Archer returned to Ireland, landing in the south-east (at either Waterford or Wexford), with a view to re- establishing the Jesuit mission there and to raise funds for the college at Salamanca. The brief visit became an enforced stay of four years, and it was soon decided at Rome to make him superior of the new mission. His presence came to the attention of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir William Russell, and the government regarded him with such suspicion that a reward was offered for his capture. By August 1598 it seems Archer had fled north to Ulster, where he joined the rebels as the Nine Years war entered its most active phase. It is probable that, following the English defeat at the battle of the Yellow Ford later in that year, he decided to commit himself to the cause of Hugh O'Neill. With this new found authority he returned south to more familiar territory. During the rest of the war reports of Archer's exploits were legion, so that an aura of mystery and almost awe was attached to his name, and government officers referred to him as the \\"arch traitor\\" and the \\"arch devil\\". However exaggerated the reports, it is certain that he was present at the taking of the Earl of Ormond in 1599, when the rebel O'Mores lured the most powerful nobleman in the country to a parley in a remote part of Carlow and seized him by treachery. The earl spent a substantial period in custody, with Archer attending on him regularly, at a time when the English presence in Ireland was in jeopardy. Ormond's seizure - which followed the departure from Ireland of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex after a disappointing campaign (see Essex in Ireland) - was put down by the Lord President of Munster, Sir George Carew, to Archer's influence. Upon Ormond's release some months later - unharmed - the earl described Archer as an \\"odious traitor\\". It may be that Ormond himself was complicit in the act, with some suggestion that he was indulging in a long game to ensure his power against the hazard of an outright defeat of the English and the removal of their influence from Ireland. One source later claimed that Ormond had converted to the Catholic faith during his captivity, and Archer is reported to have declared that the earl would be made king of Ireland upon Spanish intervention. This episode still defies satisfactory explanation. Spanish intervention In October 1599 Archer left Ireland for Rome, where he effectively acted as O'Neill's envoy. Pope Clement VIII delayed the appointment of a nuncio to Ireland, but at Madrid plans for an Irish expedition were given renewed attention upon the agreement of peace between Spain and France. In early 1601 Philip III of Spain opted to send an armada with a force of 6000 soldiers, and the Dublin government began preparations to meet the Spanish effort. During the spring and summer of 1601 Carew and Cecil received reports of the activities of Archer, who had just arrived in Spain. Despite the appointment of a Jesuit nuncio - a neutral who was averse to a militant mission in Ireland - Archer managed to defer service in the seminary at Salamanca and involved himself in the Irish expedition instead. He proposed a landing in Munster - in the south - while the commander of the expedition, Juan del √Åguila, insisted on the north. In consultation, O'Neill and the northern rebels recommended a compromise: a landing on the coast between the south-western port of Limerick and Lough Foyle in the extreme north. In September Archer set sail with the armada, which bore over 4500 soldiers and was bound for the port of Cork, or its alternative at Kinsale - both destinations lay at the extreme south of the island. Battle of Kinsale On arriving in Munster in September 1601, del Aguila discovered that the province lay docile under Carew's command, following the imprisonment of Florence MacCarthy and the capture of the Sugan Earl of Desmond. Archer vouched for a local chieftain, O'Sullivan Beare, who offered to block the march from Dublin of the crown's principal army, but del Aguila declined. The Spanish occupied the walled town of Kinsale, which was soon surrounded by Mountjoy in a siege that was to last three months. The rebel armies of O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell marched the length of the country in bitter winter conditions, but were broken by the English cavalry and driven from the field in December at the battle of Kinsale. Del Aguila then surrendered on terms and departed with his forces for Spain. Archer immediately engaged in recrimination. He accused the Spanish commander of cowardice and vacillation, of refusing to heed local advice and failing to sally out and join with his Irish allies at the critical point. Anticipating further Spanish aid, Archer left Kinsale and fell in with O'Sullivan Beare, who was holding out further down the coast. Consideration was being given at the court of Philip III to a further expedition, and Archer sailed for Spain on 6 July 1602 (just before the Siege of Dunboy) to report on the state of Ireland. At court Archer railed against del Aguila. For his part, the commander argued against further aid to the Irish and presented the king with a forged letter - supplied to him by Carew - purporting to be from Archer, in which the priest was supposed to have sought his pardon from Queen Elizabeth. The arguments dragged on, but by March 1603 Archer appears to have been vindicated while del Aguila was restrained in his lodgings. Archer's hopes of aid continued, but after the queen's death in March 1603 O'Neill accepted terms of surrender from Mountjoy. Upon the accession of James I of England to the English throne in May a new dispensation was in place, and in the following year a peace was concluded with the Spanish. Del Aguila was eventually exonerated, and in Ireland Carew ordered all Jesuits and seminary priests to depart the kingdom. Archer sought a return to Ireland, and for years afterward his imminent arrival was touted in English government propaganda. But the remainder of his life was spent in Spain. The Irish College Archer was appointed prefect of mission by the Jesuit father- general, Aquaviva, with the task of co-ordinating the work of the Irish colleges in Iberia. At Salamanca a dispute had arisen over allegations that the Jesuits were discriminating against Gaelic Irish students in favour of Old English students from those parts of Ireland more loyal to English crown authority. A Spanish rector was appointed after a royal inquiry, but Archer intervened, seeking greater safeguards for the disadvantaged students, and was granted his wish by the king. In 1610 the Salamanca institution became a Royal College.McCoog p.119 Archer spent much time at court, and his approach to his responsibilities is summed up in the following quote, concerning the opportunity afforded through the running of the seminaries: \\"if we do not take advantage of it we shall do nothing heroic or outstanding\\". Decline and death Archer began to suffer ill health in 1608, and little is known of him until 1613, when he stayed two months at Bordeaux on seminary business. He appears to have commanded respect for his devoted religious observance. In 1615 Archer again sought to return to Ireland, but his request was denied by the new Jesuit father--general, Mutius Vitelleschi. He spent the last years of his life at Santiago de Compostella as spiritual father to the seminarians. On 15 February 1620 he died at the Irish college there. Legacy Archer became notorious for his contributions to the rebel cause during the Nine Years War. But his greater work was arguably in the establishment of the continental seminaries for Irish students, which went from strength to strength in the succeeding centuries and contributed greatly to the Counter-Reformation.

Due to this work formerly being attributed to Hyginus Gromaticus, its author is often called \\"Pseudo-Hyginus\\". This work is the most detailed surviving description of a Roman military camp (Latin: castra) and dates most probably from the late 1st to early 2nd century AD.A Camp in search of a Campaign: The reality of Hyginus' Roman army. D B Campbell, https://www.academia.edu/865462/A_Camp_in_search_of_a_Campaign_The_reality_of_Hyginus_Roman_army  The author and the time of creation of the work  Very little is known about the author of De munitionibus castrorum. According to the text, his work was intended to be a useful manual about how to properly lay out a military camp, specially written for a high-ranked officer: :\\"novitatem metationis ad magnitudinem tuam primus adferam, quae tibi spero placebit, si primum cottidianam metationem tractabis\\"cap.47 He also suggests that he was a beginner author and used other authors' works relevant to the theme: :\\"In quantum potui, domine frater, pro tirocinio meo, in brevi omnes auctores sum persecutus, sed quidquid circa compositionem castrorum aestalivium instituerunt, in hoc libello, priusquam numeros instituerem, sub ratione omnia declaravi\\"cap. 45 The exact date of creation of the work is also uncertain. According to Domaszewski, it is certain that the work was not written before the time of the Roman emperor Trajan (it mentions Daci amongst the auxiliary forces), and was before the reforms of Diocletian (the Roman legion has its traditional structure). Domaszewski suggested that the image of the camp best fits the early second century AD, prior to the reforms of Hadrian. Experts, however, still dispute the date, ranging from the earliest dating to the rule of Domitian. It is also disputed whether such a large camp was ever built by the Romans. Archaeological finds clearly show that in actual practice a military camp was not always so regularly organized, as suggested by the author. But, as he describes even the smallest part of the camp (including how much space is required for a soldier or a horse), it may be adopted to the requirements of the practice. He also mentions some general rules which must be considered when constructing a camp, although most of them are obvious (like a water source must be in the vicinity, etc.).

A graduate of the University of Melbourne, Fairley joined the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1915. He investigated an epidemic of meningitis that was occurring in Army camps in Australia. While with the 14th General Hospital in Cairo, he investigated schistosomiasis (then known as bilharzia) and developed tests and treatments for the disease. In the inter-war period he became renowned as an expert on tropical medicine. Fairley returned to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He played an important role in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the danger from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti- malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops. After the war Fairley returned to London where he became a consulting physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Wellcome Professor of Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. A serious illness in 1948 forced him to resign his professorship, but he retained his practice and membership of numerous committees, becoming an \\"elder statesman\\" of tropical medicine. Early life Neil Hamilton Fairley was born in Inglewood, Victoria, on 15 July 1891, as the third of six sons of James Fairley, a bank manager, and his wife Margaret Louisa, n√©e Jones. All four of their sons who survived to adulthood took up medicine as a career. One qualified as a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Melbourne and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in England and became a surgeon; he was killed in action in the First World War. A second also qualified as a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, and later as a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; he became senior physician at Royal Melbourne Hospital. A third son became a general practitioner. Neil was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, where he was dux of his class. He attended the University of Melbourne, graduating with his Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery with first class honours in 1915, and his Doctor of Medicine in 1917. While there, he won the Australian inter-varsity high jumping championship and represented Victoria in tennis. First World War Fairley joined the Australian Army Medical Corps with the rank of captain on 1 August 1915 and was posted to Royal Melbourne Hospital as a resident medical officer. He investigated an epidemic of meningitis that was occurring in local Army camps, and his first published paper was an analysis of this disease, documenting fifty cases. In 1916, he co-authored a monograph published by the Federal government detailing 644 cases, of which 338 (52%) were fatal, this being before the invention of antibiotic drugs.N. Hamilton Fairley and C. A. Stewart, Commonwealth of Australia Quarantine Service ‚Äì Service Publication No. 9 ‚Äì Cerebro-Spinal Fever (1916) alt=Formal group portrait of men in Army uniform Fairley enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 24 August 1916. On 5 September 1916, he embarked for Egypt on RMS Kashgar, joining the 14th General Hospital in Cairo. There he encountered Major Charles Martin, formerly Professor of Physiology at the University of Melbourne and Director of the Lister Institute from 1903 to 1930. At this time, Martin was working as a Consulting Physician to the AIF in Egypt and commanded the Anzac Field Laboratory. While in Egypt, Fairley investigated schistosomiasis (then known as bilharzia). The disease was known to be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease along the lines of the Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery. Fairley married Staff Nurse Violet May Phillips at the Garrison Church, Abbassia, Cairo on 12 February 1919. They later divorced on 21 November 1924. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 15 March 1919 and commanded the 14th General Hospital for a time before embarking for the United Kingdom in June 1919. For his services in the First World War, Fairley was mentioned in despatches and made an Officer of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire. His citation read: Between the wars Fairley was one of a number of AIF officers granted leave \\"to visit various hospitals in the United Kingdom so that they become conversant with the latest developments in the medical sciences\\". For a time, he worked for Martin at the Lister Institute in London where he qualified for membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London. He also received a Diploma of Public Health from the University of Cambridge. He returned to Australia on the transport Orontes in February 1920, to become a research assistant to Sydney Patterson, director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, where Fairley worked on developing a test for echinococcosis along the lines of the test that he had already developed for bilharzia. Fairley remained for less than a year before resigning to take up a five-year appointment in Bombay as Chair of Clinical Tropical Medicine at a newly created School of Tropical Medicine, a post for which he had been nominated by the Royal Society. On arrival in India, he found that the scheme had been abandoned and that as his appointment could be terminated at six-months' notice, he would no longer be required after October 1922. Fairley demanded and received an audience with the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Lloyd, the result of which was that the Secretary of State agreed to create a special five-year post of Medical Officer of the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory and Honorary Consulting Physician to the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Hospital and St George Hospital. In India, Fairley continued his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant and there was danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical sprue. But he was unable to determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925. Fairley returned to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked there for two years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew on the development of diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data‚Äîincluding a questionnaire to Australian clinicians‚Äîon the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited). In 1928, Fairley received an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London by the end of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942. Second World War =Middle East= alt=Formal group portrait of men in Army uniforms. One is wearing a slouch hat; the rest have peaked caps With the outbreak of the Second World War, the Australian Army's director general of medical services, Major General Rupert Downes tapped Fairley as consulting physician. Fairley was seconded to the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) with the rank of colonel on 15 July 1940 and given the serial number VX38970. He joined the AIF Headquarters in Cairo in September, taking advantage of the initial quiet period to familiarise himself with the AIF's medical units and their commanders. As the British Army in the Middle East had no consulting physician in tropical diseases, Fairley accepted an offer to act in this capacity as well. In January 1941 the British Army began planning for operations in Greece. Fairley and his British colleague, Colonel J. S. K. Boyd, the consulting pathologist, drafted a medical appreciation. Drawing on the experience of the Salonika front in the First World War, where very heavy casualties suffered from malaria, plus Fairley's more recent experience in that part of the world, they painted a gloomy picture, emphasising the grave risks, and going so far as to suggest that the Germans might attempt to entice the allies into a summer campaign in which they could be destroyed by malaria. The British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell decried their report as \\"typical of a very non-medical and non-military spirit\\", but a face-to-face meeting with Boyd and Fairley convinced Wavell that they were serious and not merely uncooperative, and Wavell promised his assistance in mitigating the danger. The campaign plan was altered to position allied forces further south, away from the plains of Macedonia and the Vardar and Struma River basins, where malaria was hyper-endemic and heavy casualties had been suffered from malaria by British troops during the First World War. Fairley tackled an outbreak of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered of their own accord but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died. Malaria again became a concern in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. The Australian Army raised malaria control units for the first time and as soon as the operational situation permitted swamps and areas of open water were drained and mosquito breeding areas were sprayed. There were 2,435 cases of malaria in the AIF in 1941, a rate of 31.8 per thousand per year. Quinine was used as a prophylaxis. On Fairley's advice, patients with relapses were treated with intravenous quinine for three days followed by a course of atebrin and plasmoquine. For his services in the Middle East, Fairley was mentioned in despatches a second time, and made a Commander of the Military Division Order of the British Empire for his \\"immense and specialised knowledge of tropical diseases in the Middle East\\". =South West Pacific= With the entry of Japan into the war, Fairley flew to Java in January 1942. Fairley was well aware that Java produced 90% of the world's supply of quinine and that the implications would be serious if Java was lost. He arranged for the purchase of all available stocks of quinine, some . Fairley was informed that the quinine had been loaded on board two ships. One was never seen again. The other, the SS Klang, reached Fremantle in March. Although of quinine was loaded on board, it was apparently unloaded when the ship stopped at Tjilatjap, possibly due to fifth columnists. Thus, none of the shipment reached Australia. Fairley himself departed Java with the I Corps staff on the transport Orcades on 21 February 1942 shortly before Java fell. In General Sir Thomas Blamey's reorganisation of the Australian Army in April 1942, Fairley was appointed director of medicine at Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Melbourne. Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the Kokoda Track campaign. An epidemic of bacillary dysentery was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea. On Fairley's advice every man who complained of diarrhoea was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days. alt=Woman in Army uniform with skirt attends a wall covered in shelves on which there are boxes of fine netting with wooden flames and gloves hanging from them. She is placing one back on a shelf. But Fairley's main concern was malaria. Despite the experience with malaria in the Middle East, most of the troops had a poor understanding of anti-malaria precautions and few medical officers had encountered the disease. In combination with critical shortages of drugs and anti-malarial supplies such as netting, insecticides and repellents, the result was a medical disaster. In the 13-week period from 31 October 1942 to 1 January 1943, the Army reported 4,137 battle casualties, but 14,011 casualties from tropical diseases, of which 12,240 were from malaria. The government grimly contemplated disbanding divisions to replace malaria casualties.Defence Committee Agendum No. 14/1943, 4 March 1943, NAA: A5954 473/4 \\"Our worst enemy in New Guinea,\\" General Blamey declared, \\"is not the Nip‚Äîit‚Äôs the bite.\\" This caused Blamey to despatch a medical mission headed by Fairley to the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1942 to present the Army's case for a more adequate and equitable share of anti-malarial supplies. The mission was successful. Fairley was able to secure supplies and expedite the delivery of those that were already on order but held up for lack of shipping or priority. In bringing the problem to the attention of the highest allied military and civil authorities overseas, he lifted the global profile and priority of malaria control measures. It was calculated that Allied requirements for atebrin would be per annum, of which would be manufactured in the United Kingdom and in the United States. American production in 1942 was estimated at 60 tons but efforts were soon under way to increase production. The possibility of producing atebrin in Australia was considered, but the drug was complicated to synthesise and required little shipping space, although steps were taken to produce mosquito repellent. As in the Middle East, the Army relied on a combination of quinine, atebrin and plasmoquine (QAP) to cure malaria. The United States and United Kingdom agreed to each produce two tons of plasmoquine each per annum. The requested drugs and supplies began arriving in December 1942. alt=Formal group portrait of men in Army uniforms As \\"one of the reasons for the lamentable record in malaria control in 1942 and early 1943 was the absence of medical authority at the level of the theatre commander's headquarters\\", Fairley suggested that there be a body responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the South West Pacific Area. General Blamey took the matter up with the General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander. MacArthur, who had himself suffered an attack of malaria back in 1904 (and a serious relapse the next year), created the Combined Advisory Committee on Tropical Medicine, Hygiene and Sanitation with Colonel Fairley as its chairman in March 1943. After its first meeting, Fairley met with MacArthur, who emphasised that he did not wish the committee to concern itself with matters of academic interest but to make concrete recommendations on essential medical matters. The committee proceeded to make a series of recommendations regarding training, discipline, equipment, procedures and priorities, which then went out as GHQ orders to all commands. Fairley's proposed use of atebrin as a prophylactic agent was accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem at this time was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still turned out to be much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever‚Äîwhich had a mortality rate of 25%‚Äîdisappeared entirely. Fairley was acutely aware that much remained unknown about malaria. In particular, he was interested in the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, as they could be manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943. Fairley travelled to New Guinea at the end of June 1943 and arranged for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project. alt=Men in Army uniforms with slouch hats stand in a row. One has his mouth open while another man in Army uniform with a slouch hat places something inside. The LHQ Medical Research Unit used human test subjects, all volunteers drawn from the Australian Army, including a small but notable group of 'Dunera Boys' (Jewish refugees) from the 8th Employment Company. The volunteers were infected with strains of malaria from infected mosquitoes, or from the blood of other test subjects, which was then treated with various drugs. The volunteers were rewarded with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey. The LHQ Medical Research Unit researched quinine, sulphonamides, atebrin, plasmoquine, and paludrine. In June 1944, a conference was held at Atherton, Queensland on \\"Prevention of Disease in Warfare\\". Chaired by Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, the commander of the First Army, it was attended by key corps and division commanders. Fairley, who had been promoted to brigadier in February 1944, described the results of the work at Cairns on anti-malarial drugs; other officers described practical measures that could be taken to reduce the toll of disease on the men. The Director General of Medical Services, Major General S. R. (Ginger) Burston, told the senior commanders \\"the ball is in your court\\". Using draconian drills that required officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted to reduce the incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the Aitape- Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact‚Äîconfirmed by research at Cairns‚Äîthat an atebrin resistant strain of malaria had arisen. The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world. Later life Neil Hamilton Fairley in 1956 After the war Australian medical research was substantially reorganised, but Fairley joined the ranks of senior Australian medical scientists who spent the remainder of their professional lives in Britain. In London he became consulting physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Wellcome Professor of Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. His early post war research was a continuation of his wartime work on malaria. He became seriously ill in 1948 and his health steadily declined thereafter, forcing him to resign his professorship. He retained his practice and membership of numerous committees, becoming an \\"elder statesman\\" of tropical medicine. In recognition of his service to tropical medicine, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 8 June 1950. Fairley's declining health prompted him to leave London and move to The Grove, Sonning, Berkshire, where he died on 19 April 1966, and was buried in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church, Sonning. He was survived by his wife and their two sons, who were both medical doctors, and also by the son of his first marriage, who had become an Australian Army officer. His son Gordon Hamilton-Fairley, a renowned oncologist, was killed by a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb on 22 October 1975. Sir William Dargie painted a portrait of Fairley in 1943, which is in the possession the Fairley family. A later 1960 portrait by Dargie, together with a 1945 one by Nora Heysen, is in the Australian War Memorial. Neither is on display, although the latter can be viewed online. A 1954 Dargie portrait of Queen Elizabeth II painted while Dargie was staying at Fairley's home at 81 Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, in London, and subsequently given to Fairley, was sold at auction to the National Museum of Australia in 2009 for $120,000. Fairley's papers were in the Basser Library at the Australian Academy of Science from 1975 until 2019. In November 2019 they were transferred to the Australian War Memorial. He is commemorated by the Neil Hamilton Fairley Overseas Clinical Fellowship, which provides full-time training in Australia and overseas in areas of clinical research including the social and behavioural sciences.

Levi Strauss & Co., then specializing in denim, introduced the Dockers brand in 1986. Dockers became a leading brand of business casual clothing for men under the leadership of Bob Siegel. In 1987, Dockers introduced a women's line. In 1993 the Dockers brand was introduced into Europe under the leadership of Joe Middleton. Dockers makes belts, pants, leather wallets, shoes and other apparel.  History  In 1853, Levi Strauss landed in San Francisco after leaving his home of Bavaria. After getting his business going, he resumed selling goods to the American people. Some of the goods he sold included clothes and footwear. Dockers emerged as one of the largest boat shoes manufacturers in the Northwest, for people to wear shoes on the Dock. Still in the early 1900s, khakis become domestic and are worn for ‚Äúclassier‚Äù occasions. All the while, undergoing a few label changes. 1916 marks the creation of the label Levi Strauss Make, which khakis then fell under. In the 1920s, Levi Strauss and Co. began producing women‚Äôs khakis made specifically for outdoor activity and comfort. By the late 1920s, khaki undergoes another label change and now falls under the famous ‚ÄúTwo Horse Brand‚Äù. in 1963, the company opened its first warehouse below the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. The new factory was located in Blackstone, Virginia. The late 1900s consisted of major moves on a business level, making Levi Strauss and Co. a brand that has gone global and been very successful. Khakis really took off when ‚Äúcasual Fridays‚Äù gained popularity in offices in the late eighties and led to the emergence of Dockers as being the go-to brand. Before going global in 1992, Dockers made an appearance on an episode of Seinfeld. However, before Seinfeld, Cheers characters were prominently wearing Dockers clothing in the late 1980s. In the 2000s, the company starts producing denim and continues to expand into different countries. By 2011, khakis were being worn by both genders of all ages.  Cost  A 1996 study shows that a pair of Dockers pants often had a price range of $50-$80 per pair. A study in 2014 helped compare older prices to more current prices within the Dockers label. This article shows that in 2014 a pair of Dockers pants sells for roughly $140 and a long sleeve shirt reaches prices as high as $120. In 2012, 27.9 percent of respondents who came from a household where the annual income was $200,000 or more stated that they owned Dockers brand apparel, accessories, and footwear. Return to focus Recently Dockers as a company have gone away from their basic khaki pants and tried to become a more diversified brand. They have overhauled their corporate structure and product assortment in a strategy to try to revitalize their core competency, the khaki pant. According to Jim Calhoun, former president of Dockers, ‚ÄúThe brand is going back to focusing on what we do best: khaki pants for men.\\" Dockers is trying to boost the selling of khaki pants, as it is a declining product among consumers. The reason for this decline in sales is the fact that people view khakis as a more corporate and office article of clothing. The brand is trying to revamp the pants by new marketing strategies. They are emphasizing the Dockers lifestyle by showing ads depicting the various products for work, dress, casual weekends, and golf. According to Levi's global chief marketing officer Jen Sey, the global vice president of marketing for Dockers, ‚Äúwe lost our focus by going after women and trying to incorporate head-to-toe dressing.\\" 2010 campaign In January 2010, the Dockers brand launched a cross-channel advertising campaign with the tagline \\"Wear The Pants.\\" The campaign premiered during the 2010 Super Bowl, and was the first Super Bowl advertisement to offer an exclusive, limited time online offer for viewers. The ad also featured \\"I Wear No Pants\\" by the Poxy Boggards. The Dockers campaign tagline, \\"Wear The Pants\\" was marketed as a call to masculinity for men. The campaign incorporated outside sources to incite men to reclaim their lost male-aesthetic. Along with a new campaign message, the Dockers brand has since revitalized their product line as well, featuring several new styles aimed at a younger, status-seeker consumer. The Dockers brand has also partnered with Habitat for Humanity as their charitable cause.

He was mentioned in despatches for his role in evacuating Anzac Cove. He was mortally wounded by a German shell at Flers. Early life and career Duncan John Glasfurd was born in Matheran, India on 23 November 1873, the second son of Major General Charles Lamont Glasfurd (d.1864) of the Bombay Staff Corps. He was educated in Edinburgh, Scotland and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, England. Glasfurd was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders on 21 October 1893, and was promoted to lieutenant on 23 February 1896. He served as adjutant of the 1st Battalion from 4 May 1898, including during their stay in South Africa during the Second Boer War.Hart's Army list, 1901 Promoted to captain on 11 January 1900, he saw action in the Orange Free State; the battle of Paardeberg (February 1900), where he was wounded; the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where he was seriously wounded near Rustenburg in October 1900. From April to November 1901, Glasfurd participated in operations against the Mad Mullah in Somalia. He returned to India, but was again redeployed to participate in further operations against the Mad Mullah in 1903‚Äì04, in which he commanded the 4th Somali Camel Corps. For his services in Somalia, Glasfurd was mentioned in despatches. After another tour in India, Glasfurd returned to Scotland in June 1908, where he became staff captain for coast defences, Scottish Command. Later that year he was selected to attend the staff college at Camberley, England. Graduating in 1909, he rejoined his regiment in Malta in May 1910. In November, he was appointed brigade major of the Lothian Infantry Brigade. On 24 June 1912, Glasfurd was seconded to the Australian Army as Director of Military Training, with the rank of captain. He was responsible for the program of compulsory training of cadets. Glasfurd was enthusiastic about the task, but dissatisfied with the quality of training being carried out by some of the area officers, whom he regarded as unsuitable for this particular task. He was also concerned about the volume of clerical work that the area officers were burdened with. On 20 September 1913, Glasfurd was promoted to major in the British and Australian armies. First World War When war was declared, Glasfurd immediately requested permission to rejoin his regiment. Permission was not forthcoming; Major General Bridges needed a staff college graduate for his 1st Division Headquarters, and Glasfurd was chosen. On 15 August 1914 he was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force as General Staff Officer (2nd Grade) (GSO2), with the rank of major. As such he was particularly responsible for training, and he supervised the training of the 1st Division at Mena Camp in Egypt. Glasfurd landed at Anzac Cove at 5:35 am on 25 April 1915. He climbed Ari Burnu straight to Colonel E. G. Sinclair-MacLagan's headquarters, where he was informed that the 2nd Brigade, instead of coming in on the left, would, owing to the 3rd Brigade having landed too far north, be diverted towards Lone Pine on the right. He returned to the beach where he found the senior officer ashore of that brigade, Lieutenant Colonel H. Elliott. In the original plan, Glasfurd was supposed to meet the 2nd Brigade and guide it ashore. In fact, Glasfurd had come ashore a few minutes later than Elliott and the rest of the brigade was not yet ashore. Glasfurd decided to form up units in Shrapnel Gully as they arrived, and started with Elliott's battalion, which he directed to Lone Pine. Glasfurd did not always get along with his superior, Lieutenant Colonel C White, who gathered all the staff functions to himself, leaving Glasfurd with little to do. When White became sick, Glasfurd took over as GSO1 of the 1st Division. White did not return, instead becoming Brigadier General General Staff (BGGS) of ANZAC, and so on 1 October 1915, the appointment became permanent and Glasfurd was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the evacuation of Anzac Cove, Glasfurd represented the 1st Division on the Rear Party staff of A. Russell, which controlled operations at Anzac Cove until Russell handed over to Colonel J. Paton. For his services at Anzac Cove, Glasfurd was mentioned in dispatches and made a brevet lieutenant colonel in the British Army in January 1916. On 1 March 1916, Glasfurd was appointed commander of the newly formed 12th Infantry Brigade, with the rank of colonel and temporary brigadier general. His first test was a route march across the Sinai Desert. By the simple expedient of resting his men from 8:50 am to 3:25 pm he managed to avoid the hottest hours of the day and still make good time. Although many men fell out, the brigade reached its bivouac in good order. The 12th Brigade moved to France in June 1916 and on 4 July entered the line in the \\"nursery\\" sector near Armenti√®res, where Glasfurd was slightly wounded on 7 July. In August 1916, the brigade was committed to action on the Somme sector, in the fighting on the Pozi√®res Heights and Mouquet Farm. On 12 November 1916, the brigade was sent into the line again at Flers. While inspecting the line into which his brigade was about to move, Glasfurd was wounded by a German shell in \\"Cheese Road\\". After an agonising ten-hour stretcher journey from the front line to the advanced dressing station, Glasfurd died that night at the British 38th Casualty Clearing Station. He was buried in the Heilly Court Cemetery at Mericourt-l'Abbe, France. For his services on the Western Front, he was twice mentioned in despatches.

It was then edited for twenty years by Frank Ormsby. It has returned as an online publication from 2014 onwards. Editors of The Honest Ulsterman were: issues 1-11 and 14-19: James Simmons; issue 12 was guest-edited by Michael Stephens; Michael Foley guest-edited issue 13, and co-edited with Frank Ormsby issues 20-34: Ormsby edited 35-74 on his own, and 75-86 with Robert Johnstone; Johnstone edited 87-95, with co- editors Ruth Hooley (later Ruth Carr) up to 93, and Tom Clyde for issues 94 and 95: Tom Clyde edited 96-110 with associate editors Ruth Carr and, from 99-110, Frank Sewell. The final print issue, 111, was edited by Ruth Carr and Tom Clyde. It was revived by the Verbal Arts Centre which appointed Darran Anderson as Editor, who edited three online issues. It is currently edited by Gregory McCartney. The magazine was published, with decreasing frequency, from May 1968 until Summer 2003 and so was one of the longest-lived and most widely read little magazines of its type in Ireland, and probably in the English- speaking world. From the start it presented Northern Irish writers alongside poets, prose-writers and critics from around the world. Early issues included work by Stevie Smith and Tony Harrison, as well as by Gavin Ewart, who continued to contribute until his death. It went on to include work from all parts of Ireland and Britain, the USA and Canada, Australia and many other places. Its beginning coincided with the emergence of a remarkable generation of poets, including Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley and Derek Mahon, but it also provided an early, often the first, platform for subsequent waves of writers such as Paul Muldoon, Ciaran Carson, Medbh McGuckian, and numerous others. A distinctive part of every issue from number 29 (July/August 1971) until the end was the \\"Business Section\\" by \\"Jude the Obscure\\", a free-ranging look at culture high and low, Irish, French and American. The \\"Business Section\\" was also used to serialise Jude the Obscure's novella \\"Farset and Gomorrah\\" and other prose pieces. Another notable contributor was John Morrow, whose comic prose pieces developed into satirical novels and short-story collections. Another aspect was literature in translation, particularly from Russian, Spanish, French and Chinese. Issues 82-86 included a section edited by John Wilson Foster, \\"Critical Forum\\". Frankie Sewell (associate editor, issues 99-110) oversaw a section in the Irish language. A series of over 30 poetry pamphlets were published along with the magazine itself, including work by Heaney, Mahon, Muldoon, McGuckian, Foley, Ormsby, Carson, Johnstone, Ewart, Tom Paulin, Carol Rumens, Iain Crichton Smith, Sean O'Brien, Geoffrey Squires, Harry Clifton, Tom Matthews and others.

It spent one week on the UK Albums Chart at number 67, 19 places lower than its predecessor Middle Class Revolt, marking the end of one of the group's relatively more successful periods. Background and recording Guitarist and former Fall member Brix Smith returned to the lineup, having rejoined the group for live shows in 1994 after quitting in 1989. She and ex-husband Mark E. Smith had come to an agreement that she would stay in Los Angeles and fly to the UK whenever needed for live performances and recording.Smith Start, Brix (2017) The Rise, The Fall, & The Rise, Faber & Faber, Her impact was immediate, and she co-wrote five of this album's 12 tracks.Azerrad, Michael; Wolk, Douglas; Pattyn, Jay \\"Fall\\", Trouser Press. Retrieved 25 February 2018 Other tracks included a Frank Zappa cover (\\"I'm Not Satisfied\\") and a re-recording of a 1990 B-side, \\"Life Just Bounces\\". Nevertheless, sales were lower than with other recent albums, and the group, always a busy touring act, performed just 16 times during the year. Cerebral Caustic turned out to be the beginning of a period of considerable turbulence for the group; having not dismissed anyone since 1990, Smith sacked keyboardist Dave Bush by letter shortly after the album's completion. Guitarist Craig Scanlon, who had been with the band for 16 years and co-authored over 120 songs, would be sacked during the sessions for the epic single \\"The Chiselers\\" at the end of the year. Smith later admitted to MOJO magazine that he had developed a drink problem during this period and he accepted that this had impacted upon the group. Scanlon's dismissal is the only sacking that Smith publicly regretted. The album's title is taken from a review in The Boston Globe by Jim Sullivan of the band's 1994 album Middle Class Revolt. There were long-standing rumours that an alternative, superior mix of this album existed, partly fuelled by Smith's statement in an interview released to the press on a promotional cassette that he and Karl Burns had re- recorded the guitars after the rest of the group had been ejected from the studio. This claim was later clarified by Smith in an interview included on the Castle Music reissue's bonus disc as referring only to opening track \\"The Joke\\". In Simon Ford's Hip Priest, Dave Bush was quoted as claiming to have been virtually erased from the album during the mixing process. The original \\"rough\\" mixes were included on the 2006 double-CD reissue by Castle Music and showed no major differences to the released version; the sound is harsher (possibly the result of being mastered from a copy of the cassette), but Bush is no more prominent. The album again featured sleeve art by Pacal Le Gras. Brix Smith said of the artwork in her 2017 book The Rise, The Fall & the Rise: > \\"If that LP isn't the worst Fall album, it definitely has the worst cover > art. When I see it now, the skull clown is Mark. It's prophetic. He looks > like a fucking skull, and he acts like a fucking clown. It's him. It's life > imitating art, and art imitating life.\\" Reception Critical reception for Cerebral Caustic was mixed. Ned Raggett, reviewing it for AllMusic, gave it three stars, stating \\"Generally the band sounds like they're having a great time...Smith himself sounds a touch disconnected around the edges, but makes up for it with some interesting vocal treatments and sudden interjections to leaven things up.\\" Jim Sullivan, reviewing the album for The Boston Globe, called it \\"another jagged pill from this long-churning engine of gleeful bile 'n' vitriol\\". John Harris, in the NME, gave it 4/10, saying the album \\"can't help but flip into moments that are worryingly generic\\" and that \\"the band sound unremarkable\\". Trouser Press viewed it as a \\"prime-slice Fall in all its caustic, cerebral glory. Rich with barbed hooklines and canny catch-phrases from a band that continues to refine its deliciously jagged edge, Cerebral Caustic is the best Fall album in years and a good omen for its future.\\" The New Rolling Stone Album Guide describes Cerebral Caustic as \\"a furious return to noisy, reckless rant form\\".Brackett, Nathan & Hoard, Christian (2004) The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (4th edn.), Simon & Schuster Ltd, , p. 294 Track listing #\\"The Joke\\" (Mark E.

Glasgow rose to prominence during the First World War as a brigade and later divisional commander on the Western Front. Post-war, he was elected to the Australian Senate, representing Queensland as a Nationalist Party member from 1919 to 1931, before appointment as Australian High Commissioner to Canada. In 1945, Glasgow returned to Australia and resumed his private business interests. He died in Brisbane in 1955, at the age of 79. Early life Thomas William Glasgow was born on 6 June 1876 at Tiaro, near Maryborough, Queensland. He was the fourth child of Mary (n√©e Anderson) and Samuel Glasgow. His father was a farmer of Ulster Scots origin. Glasgow undertook his schooling at One Mile State School in Gympie, Queensland, and then later at Maryborough Grammar School. Upon completion of his schooling, Glasgow worked as a junior clerk for a mining company in Gympie, before moving to the Queensland National Bank, in the same town, also in a clerical role. Boer War and early military career British and Australian officers during the Boer War. Glasgow is the officer standing sixth from the right Glasgow joined the Wide Bay Regiment of the Queensland Mounted Infantry in 1893, and he was sent to London in 1897 as part of a small contingent of 20 personnel from Queensland to attend the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1899, he volunteered for service in South Africa and was commissioned as a lieutenant, assigned to the 1st Queensland Mounted Infantry Contingent. While in South Africa, he took part in the relief of Kimberley, the fighting on the Modder, and the occupation of Bloemfontein. For his services, he was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1901. After returning to Australia, Glasgow went into business with his younger brother Alexander, and together they operated their father's grocery store in Gympie. Glasgow married Annie Isabel Stumm, on 21 April 1904; her father, Jacob, was the Federal member for Lilley. Later, Glasgow became a pastoralist after purchasing a cattle station in central Queensland. Glasgow remained in the militia, and in 1903, he raised a unit at Gympie, which was designated as the 13th Light Horse Regiment. On 6 May 1912, Glasgow was promoted to captain. Another promotion came on 6 May 1912 when he received his majority. When war broke out in 1914, he volunteered to join the Australian Imperial Force. Keeping his rank, he was appointed as second-in-command of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment, on 19 August. On 24 September 1914, Glasgow embarked for the Middle East, arriving in Egypt where the light horsemen undertook training until they were transferred Anzac Cove in a dismounted role, to reinforce the infantry that had landed there in April 1915. First World War After the arrival of the light horsemen at Anzac in mid-May 1915, the commander of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, Colonel Harry Chauvel, assumed control of Monash Valley. Following a reorganisation of the defences at Pope's Hill, Glasgow became second-in-command to the commander of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Rowell. While troops from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Regiments rotated through the position on weekly basis, Rowell and his staff remained to oversee the position. However, Rowell became ill and died in early August, after which Glasgow assumed command of the position. On 7 August 1915, Glasgow led an attack on Dead Man's Ridge; the ridge had sweeping views of The Nek. The assault secured part of the Turkish trenchline, but after the failed attack on the Nek, Glasgow, realising that the ridge would now be subjected to a strong counter-attack, ordered a retreat. Bringing up the rear, Glasgow, carried one of the wounded back as the Australians withdrew. Of the 200 men who had taken part in the attack, 60 had been killed, and another 94 wounded, including every officer except Glasgow. In the aftermath, Glasgow was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. George Bell In December 1915, the Allied forces withdrew from Gallipoli. In the aftermath, the Australian government decided to expand the AIF in Egypt prior to its commitment to the Western Front. As part of this process, the 13th Brigade was raised from a cadre of experienced personnel from the 3rd Brigade and reinforcements from Australia. Glasgow was given command of the new brigade in March 1916. He commanded the brigade for the next two years, including their first major action in September 1916, at Mouquet Farm. Later, the brigade fought around Messines in June 1917, Polygon Wood in September and Dernancourt in early April 1918, where the brigade fought a defensive action that helped halt the German Spring Offensive. After the Germans captured Villers-Bretonneux in mid-April 1918, Glasgow's brigade was assigned to launch a counterattack to retake the village, on the right of the attacking force. Glasgow did not agree with the 8:00 pm start time of the attack: he wanted to attack under moonlight at 10:30pm, but this was adjusted to 10:00pm. Ross Mallett recounts that \\"at the height of the battle, with the 13th Brigade surrounded on three sides, the Germans had sent Glasgow a message demanding that he surrender. 'Tell them to go to Hell' was his response\\". At the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918, Glasgow's 13th Brigade, and Harold Elliott's 15th Brigade, recaptured the town of Villers-Bretonneux on 25 April 1918 after the Germans had overrun the British 8th Division under General William Heneker. This feat was described by Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash as the turning-point of the war, although, according to historian Peter Dennis this characterisation was an exaggeration. As the German offensive was fought to a halt, Glasgow was appointed to take over command of the 1st Division on 30 June 1918. At the time, the division was assigned to the front in Flanders, where it was fighting beside British formations; but later, the 1st Division was moved to the Somme. During the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, Glasgow's division fought actions at Amiens (8 August 1918), Lihons (9‚Äì11 August 1918), Chuignes (23 August 1918) and along the Hindenburg Line (18 September 1918). The Australians were withdrawn from the line in October, and did not see action again before the war came to an end in November 1918. After the war, Glasgow returned to part-time soldiering, and in 1921 he was placed in command of the 4th Division. He was also heavily involved with commemoration services, and according to Mallett, he led \\"the Anzac Day parade in Brisbane for twenty years\\". Politics British Commonwealth Air Training Scheme in the Anzac club. After his return to Australia, Glasgow was demobilised in August 1919, and was elected to the Senate at the 1919 federal election, running for the Nationalist Party in Queensland. In June 1926, Prime Minister Stanley Bruce promoted him to cabinet as Minister for Home and Territories. He was promoted to Minister for Defence in April 1927, which office he held until the government's defeat at the 1929 election when James Scullin's Labor government assumed power. He was subsequently elected Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. According to Mallett, \\"Glasgow saw his role as frustrating Labor's inflationary policies\\". Later, during the 1931 election, a swing toward the Labor Party in Queensland ‚Äì contrary to the result at the national level ‚Äì resulted in Glasgow losing his seat. He subsequently returned to his career as a pastoralist. He also undertook the directorship of several companies. High Commissioner to Canada Glasgow became the first Australian High Commissioner to Canada when he was appointed to the role in December 1939. At the time, Australia had few overseas diplomatic missions, with Canada being only the fifth to receive an Australian diplomatic representative. In the role, Glasgow was involved in negotiating and overseeing aspects of the Empire Air Training Scheme in Canada, and promoted the Australian war effort. According to Mallett, in the role, Glasgow \\"built good relations with the Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King and his ministers, but was not successful in getting Canadian support for Australian strategy in the Pacific\\". Nevertheless, he successfully worked to establish a \\"mutual aid\\" agreement that saw Australia receive two merchant ships from Canada. Glasgow also attended several inter-Allied conferences in Quebec in August 1943 and September 1944, where he \\"represented Australian interests\\". Final years Statue of the Major-General at Post Office Square, Brisbane. (The statue is facing ANZAC Square.) In 1945, after being succeeded as High Commissioner by Alfred Stirling, Glasgow returned to Australia. The war over, he returned to private life, continuing his work as a businessman and pastoralist. He died on 4 July 1955, in Brisbane. His wife, Annie, and their two daughters survived him. After a state funeral at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Glasgow was cremated. Honours For his services during the war, Glasgow received several honours. In June 1916, he became a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). This was followed in December 1917 by appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In the 1919 New Year Honours, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). He was Mentioned in Despatches a further nine times (in addition to the one from the Boer War) and was also appointed an Officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur by the French. He also received the French Croix de Guerre and the Belgian Croix de Guerre. A statue of Glasgow, cast in bronze, was erected in Brisbane in 1966, near Roma and Turbot Streets. During 2008, the statue was moved to Post Office Square (opposite ANZAC Square), also in Brisbane. Notes References   * * External links * * Sir T.

Establishment The CARs became law on October 10, 1996 replacing the former Air Regulations and Air Navigation Orders. The authority for the establishment of the CARs is the Aeronautics Act. Both the Act and the CARs are the responsibility of the Minister of Transport and his department, Transport Canada. Organization The CARs are divided into ten functional \\"parts\\": * Part I - General Provisions * Part II - Aircraft Identification and Registration and Operation of a Leased Aircraft by a Non-registered Owner * Part III - Aerodromes, Airports and Heliports * Part IV - Personnel Licensing and Training * Part V - Airworthiness * Part VI - General Operating and Flight Rules * Part VII - Commercial Air Services * Part VIII - Air Navigation Services * Part IX - Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems * Part X - Greenhouse Gas Emissions from International Aviation - CORSIA The CARs consist of regulations, standards and advisory material. Compliance with the regulations and standards is mandatory, while complying with the advisory material is not mandatory. Standards tell how to comply with the corresponding regulation. With the exception of Part V, the regulations are numbered starting at the beginning of the part (i.e. CAR 700 is a regulation). The standards are numbered in the \\"20\\" series (i.e. CAR 720 is a standard). Advisory material is inserted in the text of the regulations and standards as \\"notes\\" or is included separately as \\"40\\" series text (i.e. CAR 740 would be advisory material). Part V (Airworthiness) of the CARs is uniquely numbered to match the US FAA FARs parts as well as the EASA and JAA regulations. As such it has regulations and standards that have the same number (i.e. There is a CAR 507 and a STD 507). Amending the CARs Creation of new regulations or standards and the amendment of existing regulations and standards are accomplished through a public consultation process known as the Canadian Aviation Regulation Advisory Council (CARAC). Advisory circulars Transport Canada also makes available other publications that are intended to assist companies and individuals governed by the CARs comply with the regulations and standards.

Exergasia In Latin, exergasia is known as expolitio.Silva Rhetoricae (2006). Expolitio History This device of parallelism was first identified by the twelfth-century Jewish scholars Abraham Ibn Ezra and Joseph Kimhi, who referred to it as \\"kefel 'inyan be- millot shonot\\" (\\"doubling of the thought with other words\\").Jewish Encyclopedia (2006). Parallelism in Hebrew Poetry The term was next identified by Christian Schoettgen, who wrote \\"De Exergasia Sacra\\" (\\"From sacred exergasia\\") in 1733.Giving & Sharing Online Library (2006). How to Enjoy the Bible The Bishop Robert Lowth identified specific types of parallelism and further defined the concept in the late eighteenth century. Definition Exergasia is used to make a point or bring home a powerful idea. Repetition is a good way of making a point, but without the restatement of the idea it tends to become boring.Illinois Medieval Association (2006). The Order of the Texts in the Bodley 34 Manuscript: The Function of Repetition and Recall in a Manuscript Addressed to Nuns As such, it is used by many great writers and orators.

Zulick (2006). Martin Luther King: I Have a Dream The idea of correcting injustice is repeated in all four lines to emphasize this idea. Shakespeare also utilizes exergasia. In The Winter's Tale, the character Florizel says > I take thy hand, this hand > As soft as dove's down, and as white as it, > Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fanned snow that's bolted > By th' northern blasts twice o'er (IV.iv.360-363).Armstrong Atlantic State > University (2006). Glossary of Rhetorical Terms Florizel calls the hand white in three different ways: comparing it to dove's down, an Ethiopian's tooth, and snow. =Music= In the sense of music, the concept of exergasia (referred to as expolitio) is used to mean much the same thing as it does in literature.

AutoShade was an early 3D rendering package for use with AutoCAD. Autodesk developed Autoshade in 1987. It became obsolete after the release of Autodesk's 3D Studio. Description AutoShade was a DOS application. Autodesk developed it to produce realistic shaded renderings of 3D face objects made by their CAD program, AutoCAD. It simulated various types of lights--spot, point, and infinite directional. To create a rendering, a person: * Made an AutoCAD Drawing file containing 3D faces * Placed AutoShade light and camera blocks * Used an AutoShade-provided AutoLISP application to export 3D faces, camera blocks, and lighting blocks to a scene file * Opened the scene file in AutoShade and rendered the image Files AutoShade wrote the rendering to an .RND file. In the first version, the .RND file was a 2D vector file, importable into applications such as Adobe Illustrator version 4. Later, when Autodesk added Gouraud shading, the .RND could also be a raster file. Autodesk developed an application called Flimaker for MS-DOS, which converted .RND files into a format usable in Autodesk Animator. This could be used, in conjunction with AutoFlix, to create rudimentary 3D animations from AutoCAD source material. Demise Though the final version of AutoShade supported RenderMan extensions, Autodesk never developed it into a full rendering application. Even with AutoFlix, it did not support keyframing or hierarchical kinematics. When Autodesk released 3D Studio, the need for AutoShade ended, since 3D Studio was far superior in technology and in ease of use.

Jovinianus' propositions Jovinianus, about whom little more is known than what is to be found in Jerome's treatise, published a Latin treatise outlining several opinions: #That a virgin is no better, as such, than a wife in the sight of God. #Abstinence from food is no better than a thankful partaking of food. #A person baptized with the Spirit as well as with water cannot sin. #All sins are equal. #There is but one grade of punishment and one of reward in the future state. In addition to this, he held the birth of Jesus Christ to have been by a \\"true parturition,\\" and was thus refuting the orthodoxy of the time, according to which, the infant Jesus passed through the walls of the womb as his Resurrection body afterwards did, out of the tomb or through closed doors. Response to Jovinianus Pammachius, Jerome's friend, brought Jovinian's book to the notice of Siricius, bishop of Rome, and it was shortly afterwards condemned in synods at that city and at Milan about 390 CE. He subsequently sent Jovinian's books to Jerome, who answered them in the present treatise in 393. Little is known of Jovinian, but it has been conjectured from Jerome's remark in the treatise against Vigilantius, where Jovinian is said to have \\"amidst pheasants and pork rather belched out than breathed out his life,\\" and by a kind of transmigration to have transmitted his opinions into Vigilantius, that he had died before 409, the date of that work.  Outline of Against Jovinianus  The first book is wholly on the first proposition of Jovinianus, that relating to marriage and virginity. The first three chapters are introductory. The rest may be divided into three parts: *Chapters 4‚Äì13 - An exposition, in Jerome's sense, of St. Paul's teaching in I Cor. 7. *Chapters 14‚Äì39 - A statement of the teaching which Jerome derives from the various books of both the Old and the New Testaments. * A denunciation of Jovinianus (chapter 40), praise of virginity, and critique of marriage as a source of worldly distraction.

Balachander, starring Kamal Haasan and Rati Agnihotri. It was a remake of the director's own Telugu film Maro Charitra (1978), which had Kamal Haasan playing the lead role. The film was labelled a \\"blockbuster\\" at the box office in 1981, earning a total of in receipts. The film featured lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi and music by Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal. It received critical acclaim upon release, winning a National Film Award and 13 Filmfare nominations, eventually winning three. Got No. 6 on Box-Office collection list.List of Bollywood films of 1981  Plot  The movie is about the love between a Tamil man, Vasu (Kamal Haasan), and a North Indian woman, Sapna (Rati Agnihotri), who are neighbours in Goa. They come from totally different backgrounds and can hardly speak the other's language. When Vasu and Sapna admit their love, there is chaos in their homes they face an unexpected test of their love. The movie begins with an old, ruined building near the beautiful beach of Goa. The dilapidated walls of the building are covered with many names, but two names stand apart from the rest---Vasu and Sapna. Vasu is a happy, carefree young lad who belongs to a Tamil family. He resigns his job after his boss scolds him and he returns to home in Goa. His orthodox Tamilian father is always at loggerheads with the Hindi-speaking neighbour family. The family has a beautiful daughter named Sapna, a college student. While being stalked by a perverted librarian on a lonely road, Sapna finds Vasu jogging and starts a conversation with him. Seeing this, the librarian goes away. Sapna thanks Vasu for pretending to be her friend, but he reveals that he doesn't understand Hindi. Vasu wants to make friends with her, but he unfortunately meets an accident and is admitted at the hospital. A shocked and sad Sapna sends him a gift- a mask with her name behind it. Despite the nasty fights between their families, Vasu and Sapna fall madly in love with each other. They get to know each other, experiencing the joy and innocence of first love. One day however, Sapna misunderstands Vasu that he too is just lustful and does not love her truly, and she breaks up with him. Despite Vasu's efforts to make her understand his love, Sapna ignores him and is still angry. A week later, Sapna finds Vasu awake all night looking at her window hoping that she would forgive him. Heartbroken at seeing him like that, Sapna forgives him and signals him by turning her room light off and on repeatedly. They meet the next day and Sapna expresses her love for Vasu by kissing his hand. The lovers unite and they go around the beaches, forts, waterfalls and scenic places of Goa. While returning home late night, Vasu's bike runs out of petrol. So they pose as a newly married couple and ask for a lift in a cab. But to their shock, Sapna's father is in the car and he takes her home immediately! Vasu and Sapna keep meeting each other and fall in love even more. One day when Sapna returns from college after meeting Vasu, she finds the perverted librarian at her home. The man has secretly clicked pictures of her and Vasu together and shows it to her parents. Burning with rage, Sapna's mother forbids her from seeing Vasu and acoompanies her everywhere she goes. Heartbroken, Vasu makes a plan and stealthily meets Sapna during her college lunch break. They go to a hotel for lunch and Vasu stops the lift halfway to spend sometime with Sapna. He sings a song for her using the broken Hindi he knows and they get carried away. This leads to a huge crowding at the hotel lift and someone calls the police! Vasu and Sapna's families are informed about this and they are mad with rage! Sapna is locked at home and Vasu's father scolds him very badly. Despite the opposition, Vasu boldly goes and meets Sapna in her home in the presence of her parents and expresses his love for her. Sapna's mother screams and calls everyone claiming that Vasu is ruining their family honor. Finally, both the families meet and Vasu and Sapna clearly affirm their love for each other. Their families agree to get them married on one condition‚Äîthat they should separate from each other for one year without any kind of contact.After such a period, if they still want to be together, they can get married. During the year there should be no contact between them whatsoever. Vasu and Sapna reluctantly agree to the contract hoping that they can finally get married after one year. Vasu goes to Hyderabad for a job,while Sapna stays back in Goa. During their year of separation, Vasu writes a letter every day to Sapna, in which he expressed his pain and feelings, but doesn't send it to her because of the contract. He learns to speak Hindi fluently from a young widow named Sandhya, to make Sapna's parents happy. And to drown his pain of separation, he also learns dance from Sandhya. On the other hand, Sapna visits all the places where she and Vasu used to go. Each time she walks past those places, all their memories come alive. She also visits a rocky hill by the beach, where their names 'Vasu' and 'Sapna' are painted on the highest rock. In order to make Sapna forget Vasu, her mother destroys the audio tape that he had given her. She also burns Vasu's only photo that Sapna. In response, Sapna writes Vasu's name all over her bedroom wall, making her family even more angry. Sapna goes on a college trip to Mangalore, where her mother sends her relative Chakram to spy on her. Chakram wants to marry Sapna, but she doesn't like him. Coincidentally, Vasu also comes to Mangalore due to a job assignment. He spots Sapna and follows her to her hotel room, but bumps into Chakram, who lies that he and Sapna are married! A shocked Vasu meets Sapna's college friends and asks about her, but they also tell that Chakram and Sapna are soon to be married. Vasu is heartbroken and proposes to Sandhya. She readily accepts and their wedding is fixed. When coming to meet him, she finds all the letters he wrote to Sapna, and discovers the truth. Sandhya goes to Goa and meets Sapna and finds that she is not married and is waiting for Vasu. Seeing their true love, Sandhya sacrifices her love and decides to unite Vasu and Sapna. She tells the truth to Vasu and cancels their wedding, urging him to go and meet his beloved Sapna as their one-year contract was getting over. Sandhya's older brother hears that the wedding is cancelled and thinks that Vasu cheated his sister. In a drunken state, he phones his criminal friend in Goa and asks him to 'completely get rid' of Vasu! Despite the obstacles against them, will the two lovers ever unite is what forms the heart-breaking climax of the movie.  Cast  * Kamal Haasan as S.

Three of them received Filmfare nominations. The only person who was missing in the Hindi remake who was in the original Telugu film Maro Charitra (1978) was leading lady Sarita, as her role was now played by Rati Agnihotri. Director K. Balachander, Kamal Haasan, Madhavi, and S.P. Balasubrahmanyam all repeated their artistry in the Hindi version.  Soundtrack  The music was composed by Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. It was the first Hindi film for South Indian singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam; the music directors were initially against including him, feeling that the \\"Madrasi\\" would not do justice to a Hindi composition, but Balachander cited that if the lead character played by Haasan could not speak Hindi well, then even if Balasubrahmanyam blemished the song, it would \\"capture the character.\\" Two portions of \\"Tere Mere Beech Mein\\" were later sampled in the 2004 Britney Spears hit song \\"Toxic\\" as part of its hook.

History Kistrand was the name of Porsanger Municipality from 1 January 1838 until 1 January 1964 when it was changed to Porsanger. The municipality was named after the parish of Kistrand, based at the Kistrand Church which is in this village.

This area of true contact, most often constitutes only a very small fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area. In relation to two contacting objects, the term Contact area refers to the fraction of the nominal area that consists of atoms of one object in true contact with the atoms of the other object. Because objects are never perfectly flat due to asperities, the actual contact area (on a microscopic scale) is usually much less than the contact area apparent on a macroscopic scale. Contact area may depend on the normal force between the two objects due to deformation. The contact area depends on the geometry of the contacting bodies, the load, and the material properties. The contact area between the two parallel cylinders is a narrow rectangle. Two, non-parallel cylinders have an elliptical contact area, unless the cylinders are crossed at 90 degrees, in which case they have a circular contact area. Two spheres also have a circular contact area. Friction and contact area It is an empirical fact for many materials that F = ŒºN, where F is the frictional force for sliding friction, Œº is the coefficient of friction, and N is the normal force. There isn't a simple derivation for sliding friction's independence from area. Methods for determining contact area One way of determining the actual contact area is to determine it indirectly through a physical process that depends on contact area. For example, the resistance of a wire is dependent on the cross- sectional area, so one may find the contact area of a metal by measuring the current that flows through that area (through the surface of an electrode to another electrode, for example.)

In 1899, along with Bernard Russell and Will Bentley, Graham moved the concert party to the West Cliff Gardens. Bernard Russell died in 1910, but Graham and Bentley continued the concert party. In 1912 they signed up a new romantic baritone by the name of Stanley Holloway. He stayed with the company for three years. In 1928, Graham and Bentley built a new theatre on the site of their concert party, the theatre which still stands in Clacton-on-Sea today as the West Cliff Theatre. In 1934, Graham and Bentley sold the theatre and it was bought by Will Hammer, who already owned several seaside theatres. In 1934 he also founded the film company Hammer Film Productions, which was later to gain worldwide fame as the producer of many horror films. Will Hammer died in 1957 and there was much doubt over whether the theatre would continue. Eventually, Clacton Council bought the theatre and continued to put on shows. In 1985, a local group of theatre enthusiasts took over the day-to-day running of the theatre and in 1995 bought the freehold of the theatre from the council. The West Cliff (Tendring) Trust is now solely responsible for putting on the shows at the theatre and still maintain the tradition of putting on a summer show.

It was previously called Senecio obovatus. Basal and lower leaves are obovate with toothed margins, while upper leaves are pinnately divided. The ray flowers are yellow and the disk flowers orange-yellow, the inflorescences being held well above the foliage. Description Packera obovata is an erect perennial herb growing to a height of up to . It has fibrous roots and a basal rosette of leaves up to across. They are mid-green and hairless, circular, oval or obovate in shape and have crinkly toothed margins. The leaf stalks are about the same length as the leaf blades, green or purplish in colour and usually hairless; some have slight winging and may be cobwebby-pubescent. The flower stalk may also be cobwebby at the base, and bears two or three alternate pinnatifid leaves with irregular lobes. It is topped by a flat-headed panicle, each individual flower-head being up to in diameter. The flower-head has a single row of linear-lanceolate green bracts, eight to sixteen yellow ray-florets and a central mound of orange-yellow disk florets. Both ray and disk florets are followed by brown achenes set in tufts of white hair. The achenes are dispersed by the wind, and the plant can also spread by vegetative growth from stolons or rhizomes. Distribution and habitat The native range of P. obovata is northern Mexico, the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, extending from Coahuila to Quebec and Ontario. It is most common in the southern half of the range. Typical habitats include moist but well-drained calcareous soils, wooded slopes, and rocky areas in shaded or semi-shaded locations. Ecology Flowers of P. obovata are visited by cuckoo bees, halictid bees, andrenid bees, hoverflies, tachinid flies and various species of beetle. The larvae of the northern metalmark butterfly (Calephelis borealis) feed on the leaves of the plant, and the white-crossed seed bug (Neacoryphus bicrucis) feeds on the seeds. Like many species of ragwort, the plant is toxic to many herbivorous mammals, but sheep seem more tolerant of it than are most other grazing animals.

The park was named after a very large (300 feet long, 125 feet wide) swimming pool which was opened on the site in 1920. The pool was surrounded by a beach and quickly became a favorite summer retreat for residents of Roanoke and Salem. Amusement park rides were added to the facility within a few years of its opening. The park also included a pavilion, which hosted celebrity concerts. Frequent performers included country artists Tom T. Hall and Conway Twitty. Nearby Roanoke College also had use of the park when it was closed in the winter as an area for its men's lacrosse team to use for practice. Decline and closure The pool eventually declined in popularity as home swimming pools became popular and after courts mandated desegregation. In 1967, the pool was filled in as part of an expansion project, the highlight of which was a new wooden roller coaster named the Wild Cat. Lakeside remained a popular destination through the 1970s and early 1980s, though larger parks such as Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens were beginning to draw away visitors. Nearby Masons Creek inundated the park during the flood of November 1985. Somewhat surprisingly, the park was able to repair the damage and even construct new attractions for the 1986 season. Unfortunately, that year a maintenance worker, a 19-year old named Tom Austin, was struck and killed by the roller coaster, due to the noise of a weed trimmer preventing him from hearing the roller coaster as it came down a hill at a high speed, during a test run.\\"Park worker killed by roller coaster\\", The Tennessean, May 10, 1986. p. 45. The park's updates had failed to reverse the decline in attendance and revenues. The park also occupied a very valuable parcel of real estate at the intersection of two highways only a mile south of Interstate 81. Lakeside Amusement Park closed its gates for the last time on October 19, 1986. =Aftermath= Within a few years, the site was the location of a strip mall, named Lakeside Plaza, with Kroger and several other stores and restaurants. This neighborhood of Salem is still commonly referred to as Lakeside and several churches and businesses bear the name. The closure of Lakeside led to the creation of the Salem Fair in 1988. This event, which has free admission, runs annually for ten days in late June to early July. Estimated attendance in most years averages around 300,000, which makes it the second largest fair in Virginia, trailing only the State Fair of Virginia in Doswell, Virginia. =Current plans= In January 2015, a committee was formed to rebuild Lakeside. Currently the project is moving forward with over $5 million of attractions and rides donated to the project. The new park will be located in the Roanoke Valley and is expected to open in the next few years. There is a Facebook page for updates on this project, named \\"Lakeside Reborn,\\" which gained over 1,500 members in one week.

Later in life he settled in Albany, Western Australia and was appointed Government Resident in 1833. He was born in Southwark, in London's dockland, and died at Strawberry Hill Government Farm, Mira Mar in Albany, Western Australia. Naval career He joined the ship's complement of the 38-gun frigate HMS Arethusa, in 1793, as captain's servant. He joined the 74-gun in 1794. He took part in the 4th Battle of Ushant, also known as the Glorious First of June, in 1794. He transferred to after she was captured in the battle. He was wounded in action on 23 June. Spencer was appointed a midshipman in 1795 and moved to , a 16-gun sloop, under Robert Larkan. He went with Larkan to the latter's new command, the 20-gun , in September 1797. In 1799, Spencer was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. He was commissioned into , a 100-gun ship of the line. However, she blew up in an accident before he could join her. He joined the 80-gun , one of the few French ships to escape Nelson at the Battle of the Nile. She had, however, subsequently been captured. She was then renamed . He then joined the sloop , as lieutenant to the captain. This vessel supported the campaign to oust Napoleon's troops from Egypt. Spencer was captured in Genoa in 1803, having been put ashore after hostilities had again broken out after the Treaty of Amiens. He escaped in the Danish vessel Enighiden and was rescued by . From here, he was transferred to , Nelson's flagship in the Mediterranean. He gave Nelson what information he had gleaned from his stay in Genoa. Nelson appointed him to command the captured French 12-gun privateer schooner ; her name was changed to HMS Crafty. He was injured by an oar on board Craftys jolly boat, which may have left a permanent mark on his health. He did not take part in the Battle of Trafalgar but he had lost a useful friend in Nelson. In 1806, he captured vessels running sulphur from Sicily to Toulon, France, for making gunpowder. He took part in the Battle of Maida, in which his vessel harassed the retreating French army.The Battle of Maida gave rise to the name Maida Vale, a suburb of London. By successful diplomacy, he obtained the release of Christian slaves from the Dey of Algiers. He personally saved his ship from accidental destruction by the much larger HMS Eagle, in Valletta harbour. He had to surrender his ship to three Spanish privateers, in 1807. He was later cleared by court martial for the loss of Crafty, but was reprimanded for having lost contact with , with which he had been in company, and for staying too long at anchor in the harbour where the Spanish found him.Hepper (1994), p.118. He next was involved in action against the Dutch, in the East Indies. He was promoted to Commander on 8 April 1808 and given command of Samarang, in which he participated the Spice Islands campaign that led to the capture of Amboyna and captured Pulo Ay. He was made post captain on 25 July 1810 and then on 18 August took command of . Prize money acquired during his successful career, enabled him and his family to settle down, after the end of hostilities, in 1815. He retired from the Navy during 1817.

Their first son, Richard, was born in Charmouth in 1814 but died in Malta in 1815. They were to have 10 children. Lyme Regis He bought a house in Lyme Regis, in 1817. This was situated on the Exeter road, overlooking the Cobb harbour. After the Great Storm of 1824, no doubt stimulated by fears for the safety of shipping on that treacherous coast, he was engaged in pioneering ideas for a buoyant and self-righting 'lifeboat'. This was an adapted pilot boat, with copper buoyancy tanks fitted. Knighthood and Australia Richard Spencer followed news of the colonisation of Australia with interest. He determined to emigrate for the sake of the future of his several children. He was knighted in 1833 (Companion of the Bath 1815 and Knight of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order 1833). He became a Military Knight Commander of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order. This was not a government nomination but was in the personal gift of King William IV. He was appointed Government Resident of the settlement of Albany, Australia, in 1833. Spencer, together with 21 members of his family and servants, emigrated to Australia arriving in Albany September 1833 with merino sheep, cattle, horses other livestock along with plants, fruit-tree cuttings and seeds. In his time in Australia, he pioneered farming methods suitable to that difficult terrain and climate. Spencer died at his residence on 24 July 1839.Robert Stephens, 'Spencer, Sir Richard (1779 - 1839)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition, Copyright 2006, updated continuously, ISSN 1833-7538, published by Australian National University His two eldest sons died in two tragic accidents shortly after their father's death.

(The Old Farm at Strawberry Hill has exceptional national and state cultural significance as it was the first farm in the state of Western Australia, about being developed by the officers of the Military settlement of King George Sound. Vegetables were grown there for the survival of the soldiers and then the early settlers. A cottage was constructed by Dr Alexander Collie, the first Government Resident, for a visit by Governor Stirling in 1831. It was extended in 1836 by Richard Spencer.) *The painting 'The Day After the Battle of Trafalgar' is not by this Richard Spencer but by the maritime artist Richard B.

With the help of reviews in audiophile publications such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound, they solidified their position as one of the most well-respected audio manufacturers. Many industry observers consider the founder, William Z. Johnson, as one of the true originators of the entire concept of high-end audio as it exists today. History The company was founded by William Zane Johnson in 1970 and was originally located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Audio Research moved from Plymouth to Maple Grove, MN in August 2018. Johnson began designing custom audio electronics in the early 1950s and was the former owner of Electronic Industries, a specialty audio retail store in Minneapolis until the mid-1960s. Johnson died on December 10, 2011, in Rancho Mirage, California, at the age of 85. In 2008, Audio Research was acquired by Fine Sounds SpA, which owned Sonus faber loudspeakers. Fine Sounds acquired several other highly esteemed high-end audio companies, including Sumiko, Wadia, and McIntosh Laboratories. In 2014, Fine Sounds Group was purchased by a group headed by the Charles Randall and Mauro Grange. In 2016 the group was renamed McIntosh Group.

Other vernacular names used in cultivation include small periwinkle, common periwinkle, and sometimes in the United States, myrtle or creeping myrtle. Leaf margins for comparison; Vinca minor above, Vinca major below; note hairless margin of V. minor, hairy margin of V. major. Scale in mm. Description Vinca minor is a trailing subshrub, spreading along the ground and rooting along the stems to form large clonal colonies and occasionally scrambling up to high but never twining or climbing. The leaves are evergreen, opposite, long and broad, glossy dark green with a leathery texture and an entire margin. The flowers are solitary in the leaf axils and are produced mainly from early spring to mid summer but with a few flowers still produced into the autumn; they are violet-purple (pale purple or white in some cultivated selections), diameter, with a five-lobed corolla. The fruit is a pair of follicles long, containing numerous seeds. The closely related species Vinca major is similar, but larger in all parts, and also has relatively broader leaves with a hairy margin. Cultivation Ground cover with dense growth The species is commonly grown as a groundcover in temperate gardens for its evergreen foliage, spring and summer flowers, ease of culture, and dense habit that smothers most weeds. It was once commonly planted in cemeteries in parts of the Southern United States and naturalized periwinkle may indicate the presence of graves whose other markers have disappeared. The species has few pests or diseases outside its native range and is widely naturalised and classified as an invasive species in parts of North America. Invasion can be restricted by removal of rooting stems in spring. Once established, it is difficult to eradicate, as its waxy leaves shed most water-based herbicide sprays. Removal involves cutting, followed by immediate application of concentrated glyphosate or triclopyr to the cut stems. Repeated chemical treatments may be necessary, along with digging up the roots where feasible. =Cultivars= Cv. ‚ÄòArgenteovariegata‚Äô There are numerous cultivars, with different flower colours and variegated foliage. Many have a less vigorous habit than the species, and are therefore more suitable for smaller gardens. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- * Argenteovariegata (leaves have creamy white margins) * Atropurpurea (burgundy-purple flowers) * Azurea Flore Pleno (double blue flowers) * Bowles‚Äôs Variety‚Äô (violet-blue flowers: also known as ‚ÄòBowles‚Äôs Blue‚Äô and ‚ÄòLa Grave‚Äô)  Medicinal use: chemical constituents  Vinca minor contains more than 50 alkaloids, including vincamine. Other alkaloids include reserpine, reserpinine, akuammicine, majdine, vinerine, ervine, vineridine, tombozine, vincamajine, vincanine, vincanidine, vincamone, apovincamine, vincaminol, desoxyvincaminol, vincorine and perivincine. Vinpocetine (brand names: Cavinton, Intelectol; chemical name: ethyl apovincaminate) is a semisynthetic derivative alkaloid of vincamine. Colour The colour name periwinkle is derived from the flower.

The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 (, ch. 360, ) was the first Clean Air Act (United States) enacted by Congress to address the national environmental problem of air pollution on July 14, 1955. This was \\"an act to provide research and technical assistance relating to air pollution control\\". The act \\"left states principally in charge of prevention and control of air pollution at the source\\". The act declared that air pollution was a danger to public health and welfare, but preserved the \\"primary responsibilities and rights of the states and local government in controlling air pollution\\".69 Stat. 322 (1955) The act put the federal government in a purely informational role, authorizing the United States Surgeon General to conduct research, investigate, and pass out information \\"relating to air pollution and the prevention and abatement thereof\\".Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, Sec. 2 Therefore, The Air Pollution Control Act contained no provisions for the federal government to actively combat air pollution by punishing polluters. The next Congressional statement on air pollution would come with the Clean Air Act of 1963. The Air Pollution Control Act was the culmination of much research done on fuel emissions by the federal government in the 1930s and 1940s. Additional legislation was passed in 1963 to better fully define air quality criteria and give more power in defining what air quality was to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. This additional legislation would provide grants to both local and state agencies. A replacement, the Clean Air Act (United States) (CAA), was enacted to replace the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955. A decade later the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act was enacted to focus more specifically on automotive emission standards. A mere two years later, the Federal Air Quality Act was established to define \\"air quality control regions\\" scientifically based on topographical and meteorological facets of air pollution. California was the first state to act against air pollution when the metropolis of Los Angeles began to notice deteriorating air quality. The location of Los Angeles furthered the problem as several geographical and meteorological problems unique to the area exacerbated the air pollution problem. Prior to 1955 Prior to the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, little headway was made to initiate this air pollution reform. U.S. cities Chicago and Cincinnati first established smoke ordinances in 1881. In 1904, Philadelphia passed an ordinance limiting the amount of smoke in flues, chimneys, and open spaces. The ordinance imposed a penalty if not all smoke inspections were passed. It was not until 1947 that California authorized the creation of Air Pollution Control Districts in every county of the state. Amendments to the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 There have been several amendments made to The Air Pollution Act of 1955. The first amendment came in 1960, which extended research funding for four years. The next amendment came in 1962 and basically enforced the principle provisions of the original act. In addition, this amendment also called for research to be done by the Surgeon General. In 1967, the Air Quality Act of 1967 was passed. In 1967, the Air Quality Act was enacted in order to expand federal government activities. In accordance with this law, enforcement proceedings were initiated in areas subject to interstate air pollution transport. This amendment allowed states to enact federal automobile emissions standards. Senator Edmond Muskie (D-Maine) said that this was the ‚Äúfirst comprehensive federal air pollution control.‚Äù The National Air Pollution Control Administration then provided technical information to the states, which the states used to develop air quality standards. The NAPCA then had the power to veto any of the states' proposed emission standards. This amendment was not as effective as it was initially thought to be, with only 36 air regions designated, and as well as no states having fully developed pollution control programs. In 1969, another amendment was made to the act. This amendment further expanded the research on low emissions, fuels, and automobiles. The 1970 amendments, also known as the Clean Air Act, completely rewrote the 1967 act. In particular, the 1970 amendments required the newly created The United States Environmental Protection Agency to set technology-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards for major new stationary sources and state air quality management programs to protect public health and welfare.John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. ‚ÄúCleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. September 2017. Pages 11, 12. In addition, the 1970 amendments required various states to submit state implementation plans for attaining and maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and required the use of air monitoring to determine if implementation plans were successful. National technology-forcing emissions standards were also set for new automobiles. This amendment allowed citizens the ability to sue polluters or government agencies for failure to abide by the act. Finally, the amendment required that by 1975, the entire United States would attain clean air status. 1990 was the most recent amendments to the act under President George H.W. Bush. The 1990 amendments granted significantly more authority to the federal government than any prior air quality legislation. Nine subjects were identified in this amendment, with smog, acid rain, motor vehicle emissions, and toxic air pollution among them. Five severity classifications were identified to measure smog. To better control acid rain, new regulatory programs were created. New and stricter emission standards were created for motor vehicles beginning with the 1995 model year. The National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants program was created to expand much broader industries and activities. National Air Pollution Symposium SRI participant Paul Magill discussing the smog on Black Friday in Los Angeles at the first air pollution conference in 1949 The first National Air Pollution Symposium in the United States was held in 1949 and hosted by Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). At first, smaller governments were responsible for the passage and enforcement of such legislation. The main purpose of the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was to provide research assistance to find a way to control air pollution from its source. A total of $5 million was granted to the public health service for a five-year period to conduct this research. According to a private website, the amount was $3 million allotted per year for the five-year period of research. Effects of the Act This was the first act from the government that made U.S. citizens and policy makers aware of this global problem. Unfortunately, this act did little to prevent air pollution, but it at least made government aware that this was a national problem. The act allowed Congress to reserve the right to control this growing problem. The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was the first federal law regarding air pollution. This act began to inform the public about the hazards of air pollution and detailed new emissions standards. Public opinion polls showed that the percentage of Americans who regarded air pollution as a serious problem almost doubled from 28% in 1965 to 55% in 1968 with the addition of all the amendments made to the original Air Pollution Control Act of 1955. Despite having the term \\"control\\" in the title of the act, this legislation had no regulation component. In the early 1950s Congress did not want to interfere with states' rights; as such, the early laws of the act were not strong. This act set up the role that the government would play in research on air pollution effects and control. As such, the act was the forefront of the air pollution movement that continues to this day. Amendments were added to The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 as well as the Clear Air Act frequently by the government, as the government continued to further research on the topic and improve air quality.

Natural sand dunes and constructed dikes, dams, and floodgates provide defense against storm surges from the sea. River dikes prevent flooding from water flowing into the country by the major rivers Rhine and Meuse, while a complicated system of drainage ditches, canals, and pumping stations (historically: windmills) keep the low-lying parts dry for habitation and agriculture. Water control boards are the independent local government bodies responsible for maintaining this system. In modern times, flood disasters coupled with technological developments have led to large construction works to reduce the influence of the sea and prevent future floods. These have proved essential over the course of Dutch history, both geographically and militarily, and has greatly impacted the lives of many living in the cities affected, stimulating their economies through constant infrastructural improvement.  History  The Greek geographer Pytheas noted of the Low Countries, as he passed them on his way to Heligoland around c. 325 BCE, that \\"more people died in the struggle against water than in the struggle against men\\". First-century Roman author Pliny wrote something similar in his Natural History: > There, twice in every twenty-four hours, the ocean's vast tide sweeps in a > flood over a large stretch of land and hides Nature's everlasting > controversy about whether this region belongs to the land or to the sea. > There these wretched peoples occupy high ground, or manmade platforms > constructed above the level of the highest tide they experience; they live > in huts built on the site so chosen and are like sailors in ships when the > waters cover the surrounding land, but when the tide has receded they are > like shipwrecked victims. Around their huts they catch fish as they try to > escape with the ebbing tide. It does not fall to their lot to keep herds and > live on milk, like neighboring tribes, nor even to fight with wild animals, > since all undergrowth has been pushed far back. The flood-threatened area of the Netherlands is essentially an alluvial plain, built up from sediment left by thousands of years of flooding by rivers and the sea. About 2,000 years ago most of the Netherlands was covered by extensive peat swamps. The coast consisted of a row of coastal dunes and natural embankments which kept the swamps from draining but also from being washed away by the sea. The only areas suitable for habitation were on the higher grounds in the east and south and on the dunes and natural embankments along the coast and the rivers. In several places the sea had broken through these natural defenses and created extensive floodplains in the north. The first permanent inhabitants of this area were probably attracted by the sea- deposited clay soil which was much more fertile than the peat and sandy soil further inland. To protect themselves against floods they built their homes on artificial dwelling hills called terpen or wierden (known as Warften or Halligen in Germany). Between 500 BC and AD 700 there were probably several periods of habitation and abandonment as the sea level periodically rose and fell. The first dikes were low embankments of only a meter or so in height surrounding fields to protect the crops against occasional flooding. Around the 9th century the sea was on the advance again and many terps had to be raised to keep them safe. Many single terps had by this time grown together as villages. These were now connected by the first dikes. After about AD 1000 the population grew, which meant there was a greater demand for arable land but also that there was a greater workforce available and dike construction was taken up more seriously. The major contributors in later dike building were the monasteries. As the largest landowners they had the organization, resources and manpower to undertake the large construction. By 1250 most dikes had been connected into a continuous sea defense. The next step was to move the dikes ever-more seawards. Every cycle of high and low tide left a small layer of sediment. Over the years these layers had built up to such a height that they were rarely flooded. It was then considered safe to build a new dike around this area. The old dike was often kept as a secondary defense, called a sleeper dike. The Plompe toren, the only remainder of the village Koudekerke A dike couldn't always be moved seawards. Especially in the southwest river delta it was often the case that the primary sea dike was undermined by a tidal channel. A secondary dike was then built, called an inlaagdijk. With an inland dike, when the seaward dike collapses the secondary inland dike becomes the primary. Although the redundancy provides security, the land from the first to second dike is lost; over the years the loss can become significant. Taking land from the cycle of flooding by putting a dike around it prevents it from being raised by silt left behind after a flooding. At the same time the drained soil consolidates and peat decomposes leading to land subsidence. In this way the difference between the water level on one side and land level on the other side of the dike grew. While floods became more rare, if the dike did overflow or was breached the destruction was much larger. The construction method of dikes has changed over the centuries. Popular in the Middle Ages were wierdijken, earth dikes with a protective layer of seaweed. An earth embankment was cut vertically on the sea-facing side. Seaweed was then stacked against this edge, held into place with poles. Compression and rotting processes resulted in a solid residue that proved very effective against wave action and they needed very little maintenance. In places where seaweed was unavailable other materials such as reeds or wicker mats were used. Sea dike keeping Delfzijl and surroundings dry in 1994Another system used much and for a long time was that of a vertical screen of timbers backed by an earth bank. Technically these vertical constructions were less successful as vibration from crashing waves and washing out of the dike foundations weakened the dike. Much damage was done to these wood constructions with the arrival of the shipworm (Teredo navalis), a bivalve thought to have been brought to the Netherlands by VOC trading ships, that ate its way through Dutch sea defenses around 1730. The change was made from wood to using stone for reinforcement. This was a great financial setback as there is no natural occurring rock in the Netherlands and it all had to be imported from abroad. Current dikes are made with a core of sand, covered by a thick layer of clay to provide waterproofing and resistance against erosion. Dikes without a foreland have a layer of crushed rock below the waterline to slow wave action. Up to the high waterline the dike is often covered with carefully laid basalt stones or a layer of tarmac. The remainder is covered by grass and maintained by grazing sheep. Sheep keep the grass dense and compact the soil, in contrast to cattle. Developing the peat swamps At about the same time as the building of dikes the first swamps were made suitable for agriculture by colonists. By digging a system of parallel drainage ditches water was drained from the land to be able to grow grain. However the peat settled much more than other soil types when drained and land subsidence resulted in developed areas becoming wet again. Cultivated lands which were at first primarily used for growing grain thus became too wet and the switch was made to dairy farming. A new area behind the existing field was then cultivated, heading deeper into the wild. This cycle repeated itself several times until the different developments met each other and no further undeveloped land was available. All land was then used for grazing cattle. The windmills of Kinderdijk, the Netherlands Because of the continuous land subsidence it became ever more difficult to remove excess water. The mouths of streams and rivers were dammed to prevent high water levels flowing back upstream and overflowing cultivated lands. These dams had a wooden culvert equipped with a valve, allowing drainage but preventing water from flowing upstream. These dams, however, blocked shipping and the economic activity caused by the need to transship goods caused villages to grow up near the dam, some famous examples are Amsterdam (dam in the river Amstel) and Rotterdam (dam in the Rotte). Only in later centuries were locks developed to allow ships to pass. Further drainage could only be accomplished after the development of the polder windmill in the 15th century. The wind-driven water pump has become one of the trademark tourist attractions of the Netherlands. The first drainage mills using a scoop wheel could raise water at most 1.5 m. By combining mills the pumping height could be increased. Later mills were equipped with an Archimedes' screw which could raise water much higher. The polders, now often below sea level, were kept dry with mills pumping water from the polder ditches and canals to the boezem (\\"bosom\\"), a system of canals and lakes connecting the different polders and acting as a storage basin until the water could be let out to river or sea, either by a sluice gate at low tide or using further pumps. This system is still in use today, though drainage mills have been replaced by first steam and later diesel and electric pumping stations. De Cruquius is one of the three pumping stations that drained the Haarlemmermeer The growth of towns and industry in the Middle Ages resulted in an increased demand for dried peat as fuel. First all the peat down to the groundwater table was dug away. In the 16th century a method was developed to dig peat below water, using a dredging net on a long pole. Large scale peat dredging was taken up by companies, supported by investors from the cities. These undertakings often devastated the landscape as agricultural land was dug away and the leftover ridges, used for drying the peat, collapsed under the action of waves. Small lakes were created which quickly grew in area, every increase in surface water leading to more leverage of the wind on the water to attack more land. It even led to villages being lost to the waves of human-made lakes. The development of the polder mill gave the option of draining the lakes. In the 16th century this work was started on small, shallow lakes, continuing with ever-larger and deeper lakes, though it wasn't until in the nineteenth century that the most dangerous of lakes, the Haarlemmermeer near Amsterdam, was drained using steam power. Drained lakes and new polders can often be easily distinguished on topographic maps by their different regular division pattern as compared to their older surroundings. Millwright and hydraulic engineer Jan Leeghwater has become famous for his involvement in these works. Control of river floods Three major European rivers, the Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt flow through the Netherlands, of which the Rhine and Meuse cross the country from east to west. The first large construction works on the rivers were conducted by the Romans. Nero Claudius Drusus was responsible for building a dam in the Rhine to divert water from the river branches Waal to the Nederrijn and possibly for connecting the river IJssel, previously only a small stream, to the Rhine. Whether these were intended as flood control measures or just for military defense and transport purposes is unclear. The first river dikes appeared near the river mouths in the 11th century, where incursions from the sea added to the danger from high water levels on the river. Local rulers dammed branches of rivers to prevent flooding on their lands (Graaf van Holland, ca. 1160, Kromme Rijn; Floris V, 1285, Hollandse IJssel), only to cause problems to others living further upstream. Large scale deforestation upstream caused the river levels to become ever more extreme while the demand for arable land led to more land being protected by dikes, giving less space to the river stream bed and so causing even higher water levels. Local dikes to protect villages were connected to create a ban dike to contain the river at all times. These developments meant that while the regular floods for the first inhabitants of the river valleys were just a nuisance, in contrast the later incidental floods when dikes burst were much more destructive. The Nederrijn in 1995 The 17th‚Äì18th centuries were a period of many infamous river floods resulting in much loss of life. They were often caused by ice dams blocking the river. Land reclamation works, large willow plantations and building in the winter bed of the river all worsened the problem. Next to the obvious clearing of the winter bed, overflows (overlaten) were created. These were intentionally low dikes where the excess water could be diverted downstream. The land in such a diversion channel was kept clear of buildings and obstructions. As this so-called green river could therefore essentially only be used for grazing cattle it was in later centuries seen as a wasteful use of land. Most overflows have now been removed, focusing instead on stronger dikes and more control over the distribution of water across the river branches. To achieve this canals such as the Pannerdens Kanaal and Nieuwe Merwede were dug. A committee reported in 1977 about the weakness of the river dikes, but there was too much resistance from the local population against demolishing houses and straightening and strengthening the old meandering dikes. It took the flood threats in 1993 and again in 1995, when over people had to be evacuated and the dikes only just held, to put plans into action. Now the risk of a river flooding has been reduced from once every 100 years to once every years. Further works in the Room for the River project are being carried out to give the rivers more space to flood and in this way reducing the flood height. Water control boards The first dikes and water control structures were built and maintained by those directly benefiting from them, mostly farmers. As the structures got more extensive and complex councils were formed from people with a common interest in the control of water levels on their land and so the first water boards began to emerge. These often controlled only a small area, a single polder or dike. Later they merged or an overall organization was formed when different water boards had conflicting interests. The original water boards differed much from each other in the organisation, power, and area that they managed. The differences were often regional and were dictated by differing circumstances, whether they had to defend a sea dike against a storm surge or keep the water level in a polder within bounds. In the middle of the 20th century there were about 2,700 water control boards. After many mergers there are currently 27 water boards left. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. The dikes were maintained by the individuals who benefited from their existence, every farmer having been designated part of the dike to maintain, with a three-yearly viewing by the water board directors. The old rule \\"Whom the water hurts, he the water stops\\" (Wie het water deert, die het water keert) meant that those living at the dike had to pay and care for it. This led to haphazard maintenance and it is believed that many floods would not have happened or would not have been as severe if the dikes had been in better condition.Bosker, F (2008). \\"Zeedijken in het noorden, Mythes en feiten over 2000 jaar kustbescherming\\", uitgeverij Noordboek, Those living further inland often refused to pay or help in the upkeep of the dikes though they were just as much affected by floods, while those living at the dike itself could go bankrupt from having to repair a breached dike. Rijkswaterstaat (Directorate General for Public Works and Water Management) was set up in 1798 under French rule to put water control in the Netherlands under a central government. Local waterboards however were too attached to their autonomy and for most of the time Rijkswaterstaat worked alongside the local waterboards. Rijkswaterstaat has been responsible for many major water control structures and was later and still is also involved in building railroads and highways. Water boards may try new experiments like the sand engine off the coast of North Holland. Notorious floods A flood at Erichem, 1809 Over the years there have been many storm surges and floods in the Netherlands. Some deserve special mention as they particularly have changed the contours of the Netherlands. A series of devastating storm surges, more or less starting with the First All Saints' flood (Allerheiligenvloed) in 1170 washed away a large area of peat marshes, enlarging the Wadden Sea and connecting the previously existing Lake Almere in the middle of the country to the North Sea, thereby creating the Zuiderzee. It in itself would cause much trouble until the building of the Afsluitdijk in 1933. Several storms starting in 1219 created the Dollart from the mouth of the river Ems. By 1520 the Dollart had reached its largest area. Reiderland, containing several towns and villages, was lost. Much of this land was later reclaimed. In 1421 the St. Elizabeth's flood caused the loss of De Grote Waard in the southwest of the country. Particularly the digging of peat near the dike for salt production and neglect because of a civil war caused dikes to fail, which created the Biesbosch, now a valued nature reserve. The more recent floodings of 1916 and 1953 gave rise to building the Afsluitdijk and Deltaworks respectively. Flooding as military defense The Defence Line of Amsterdam used flooding a des a protective measure The deliberate inundating of certain areas can allow a military defensive line to be created. In case of an advancing enemy army, the area was to be inundated with about 30 cm (1 ft) of water, too shallow for boats but deep enough to make advance on foot difficult by hiding underwater obstacles such as canals, ditches, and purpose- built traps. Dikes crossing the flooded area and other strategic points were to be protected by fortifications. The system proved successful on the Hollandic Water Line in rampjaar 1672 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War but was overcome in 1795 because of heavy frost. It was also used with the Stelling van Amsterdam, the Grebbe line and the IJssel Line. The advent of heavier artillery and especially airplanes have made that strategy largely obsolete. Modern developments Technological development in the 20th century meant that larger projects could be undertaken to further improve the safety against flooding and to reclaim large areas of land. The most important are the Zuiderzee Works and the Delta Works. By the end of the twentieth century all sea inlets have been closed off from the sea by dams and barriers. Only the Westerschelde needs to remain open for shipping access to the port of Antwerp. Plans to reclaim parts of the Wadden Sea and the Markermeer were eventually called off because of the ecological and recreational values of these waters. =Zuiderzee Works= The Zuiderzee Works turned the Zuiderzee into a fresh water lake IJsselmeer, and created 1650 km¬≤ of land. The Zuiderzee Works (Zuiderzeewerken) are a system of dams, land reclamation, and water drainage works. The basis of the project was the damming off of the Zuiderzee, a large shallow inlet of the North Sea. This dam, called the Afsluitdijk, was built in 1932‚Äì33, separating the Zuiderzee from the North Sea. As result, the Zuider sea became the IJsselmeer‚ÄîIJssel lake. Following the damming, large areas of land were reclaimed in the newly freshwater lake body by means of polders. The works were performed in several steps from 1920 to 1975. Engineer Cornelis Lely played a major part in its design and as statesman in the authorization of its construction. =Delta Works= Oosterscheldekering at work during a storm. A study done by Rijkswaterstaat in 1937 showed that the sea defenses in the southwest river delta were inadequate to withstand a major storm surge. The proposed solution was to dam all the river mouths and sea inlets thereby shortening the coast. However, because of the scale of this project and the intervention of the Second World War its construction was delayed and the first works were only completed in 1950. The North Sea flood of 1953 gave a major impulse to speed up the project. In the following years a number of dams were built to close off the estuary mouths. In 1976, under pressures from environmental groups and the fishing industry, it was decided not to close off the Oosterschelde estuary by a solid dam but instead to build the Oosterscheldekering, a storm surge barrier which is only closed during storms. It is the most well-known (and most expensive) dam of the project. A second major hurdle for the works was in the Rijnmond area. A storm surge through the Nieuwe Waterweg would threaten about 1.5 million people around Rotterdam. However, closing off this river mouth would be very detrimental for the Dutch economy, as the Port of Rotterdam‚Äîone of the biggest sea ports in the world‚Äîuses this river mouth. Eventually, the Maeslantkering was built in 1997, keeping economical factors in mind: the Maeslantkering is a set of two swinging doors that can shut off the river mouth when necessary, but which are usually open. The Maeslantkering is forecast to close about once per decade. Up until January 2012, it has closed only once, in 2007. Current situation and future The current sea defenses are stronger than ever, but experts warn that complacency would be a mistake. New calculation methods revealed numerous weak spots. Sea level rise could increase the mean sea level by one to two meters by the end of this century, with even more following. This, land subsidence, and increased storms make further upgrades to the flood control and water management infrastructure necessary. The sea defenses are continuously being strengthened and raised to meet the safety norm of a flood chance of once every 10,000 years for the west, which is the economic heart and most densely populated part of the Netherlands, and once every 4,000 years for less densely populated areas. The primary flood defenses are tested against this norm every five years. In 2010 about 800 km of dikes out of a total of 3,500 km failed to meet the norm. This does not mean there is an immediate flooding risk; it is the result of the norm's becoming more strict from the results of scientific research on, for example, wave action and sea level rise. Sand replenishment in front of a Dutch beach The amount of coastal erosion is compared against the so-called \\"basic coastline\\" (BasisKustLijn), the average coastline in 1990. Sand replenishment is used where beaches have retreated too far. About 12 million m3 of sand are deposited yearly on the beaches and below the waterline in front of the coast. The Stormvloedwaarschuwingsdienst (SVSD; Storm Surge Warning Service) makes a water level forecast in case of a storm surge and warns the responsible parties in the affected coastal districts. These can then take appropriate measures depending on the expected water levels, such as evacuating areas outside the dikes, closing barriers and in extreme cases patrolling the dikes during the storm. The Second Delta Committee, or Veerman Committee, officially Staatscommissie voor Duurzame Kustontwikkeling (State Committee for Durable Coast Development) gave its advice in 2008. It expects a sea level rise of 65 to 130 cm by the year 2100. Among its suggestions are: * to increase the safety norms tenfold and strengthen dikes accordingly, * to use sand replenishment to broaden the North Sea coast and allow it to grow naturally, * to use the lakes in the southwest river delta as river water retention basins, * to raise the water level in the IJsselmeer to provide freshwater. These measures would cost approximately 1 billion Euro/year.Delta Commissie 2008: Advice (English) =Room for the River= Global warming in the 21st century might result in a rise in sea level which could overwhelm the measures the Netherlands has taken to control floods. The Room for the River project allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. In such regions residents have been removed to higher ground, some of which has been raised above anticipated flood levels.

He was acclaimed as one of the greatest all-round sportsmen that Wales has ever produced. He captained Glamorgan County Cricket Club for 14 years, was Secretary for thirty and President for six. Personal history Wilf Wooller was born at Rhos-on- Sea in Denbighshire. He was educated at John Bright School, Llandudno, Rydal School (now Rydal Penrhos) and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a third-class degree in Archaeology and Anthropology in 1936.Richards, Huw, \\"Wooller, Wilfred (1912-1997)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, September 2004. Retrieved 3 June 2019 He married twice, first to Gillian Windsor-Clive, an unsuccessful wartime marriage that was dissolved in 1946, and in 1948 to Enid James. The couple had five children. Wooller survived incarceration by the Japanese in the Changi prisoner of war camp in Singapore during the Second World War. He was a successful BBC broadcaster and Sunday Telegraph sports journalist. Rugby career Wooller first played rugby for Rydal School and played his first international game for Wales while still a schoolboy. This was mainly due to the fact that in October 1932 Wooller failed to pass Latin, and therefore could not progress to Cambridge.Thomas (1979), pg 85. In 1932 he played a few games for North Wales Schoolboys, then he turned out for Sale at centre in the school holidays. While representing Sale he played alongside established Welsh international Claude Davey and the two joined up in a 1933 Welsh selection game as part of the 'Possibles' team. Wooller himself believed the selectors were 'mucking about' with him and Davey, so the two were over physical with their opposing numbers, which forced the selectors to choose both of them to face England at Twickenham in 1933. The 1933 England game is seen as a classic in Welsh rugby history as it was the game when the 'Twickenham bogey' was broken after nine failed attempts to beat England on their home ground. Wooler played his part in the match, which is normally remembered as Ronnie Boon's game, when he chased a breakaway Walter Elliot with forty yards to the tryline and tackled him ten yards short of a try.Smith (1980), pg 277. Wooller won 18 international rugby union caps for Wales and represented Cardiff RFC at club level. In 1935 he was inspirational in the Welsh victory over the All Blacks. He was a Cambridge blue in 1935 and 1936. =International rugby matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 474. * 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939 * 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939 * 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939 * 1935 Cricket career Wooller's first cricket was played at Rydal School and the local club, Colwyn Bay where he played alongside his father Roy and brothers Jack and Gordon. He made his Minor Counties debut for Denbighshire in 1930 and his first-class debut for Cambridge University in May 1935 against Sussex. In the same year he was selected for Cambridge University against Oxford University, so becoming a Double Blue. After graduating from Cambridge, Wooller took employment in Cardiff and joined the St Fagans club north of the city. His bowling performances and aggressive batting attracted the attention of Maurice Turnbull, Glamorgan's influential county captain and he was selected for the Championship match against Yorkshire at the Cardiff Arms Park ground. He debuted on 15 June 1938 and in his first bowling spell for the county took 3 wickets for 22 runs in nine overs. After the war Wooller was appointed Captain-Secretary of Glamorgan in 1947 and led them to an unexpected County Championship triumph in 1948. As a formidable all rounder, he was twice thwarted from playing Test cricket for England in 1948-49 and 1951-52, due to business commitments.David Foot, Beyond Bat & Ball: Eleven Intimate Portraits, Aurum, London, 1993, p. 33. He retired from first-class cricket in 1960 (reappearing briefly in 1962) and as Secretary in 1977. He served as a Test selector from 1955 to 1961. Football and other sporting career Wooller played for Cardiff City at soccer, once scoring a hat-trick at centre-forward. He also signed for Barry Town in 1938, with the intent of playing for the club on week nights while continuing his rugby at weekends. Wooller also represented Wales at squash racquets and the Cardiff Athletic Club at bowls.

He was one of the founders of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.Hirshberg: Music in the Jewish Community of Palestine 1880‚Äì1948: a Social History  Biography  After graduating with a law degree from Kiel University in 1918, Sternberg began studying composition with Hugo Leichtentritt and piano with H. Praetorius in Berlin. From 1925 Sternberg visited Palestine annually and moved there in 1932, along with other Jewish musicians who fled Germany prior to World War II. His life was devoted to composition and teaching of composition. In 1936 he helped Bronis≈Çaw Huberman found the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and promoted the Palestine chapter of the International Society for Contemporary Music. Sternberg married Frieda Pinner (Berlin, 1918), Ilse Tanja Wellh√∂ner (Tel Aviv, 1936), Ella Thal (Tel-Aviv, 1949). Music career Sternberg's works in the 1920s and 1930s were expressionistic in style and reflect the influences of Hindemith and Schoenberg. He also incorporated traditional Jewish musical idioms into his use of dense polyphonic textures. Examples of this can be seen in his salient use of the augmented 2nd and cantilation motifs in the piano cycle Visions from the East, a programmatic work concerning the Jews of Eastern Europe, and in his String Quartet no.1, where he quotes both a Yiddish song, Bei a teich (‚ÄòThe River‚Äô), and the formula for the prayer Shema Yisrael. In Berlin, Sternberg received praise for his compositions and many of his pieces were performed by leading ensembles and performers in that city. His String Quartet no.2 was performed by the Amar Quartet and Yishtabakh (‚ÄòPraise Ye‚Äô) by the Berlin Philharmonic. In 1929 he composed Yishtabakh, a work for Baritone soloist, SATB chorus, and chamber orchestra. The work was awarded the Engel Prize in 1946; an award Sternberg earned again in 1960.Hirshberg: \\"Erich Walter Sternberg\\", Grove Music Online Sternberg found it difficult to overcome the trauma of displacement from his German heritage and never felt entirely comfortable in Israel. He was never offered a permanent position at the Palestine Conservatory or the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,E.W. Sternberg: ‚ÄòAutobiography‚Äô, Tatzlil although he occasionally taught there as a guest lecturer. In Palestine, Sternberg's compositional expression returned to nostalgic Romanticism in his large-scale orchestral works while simultaneously preserving a more modern harmonic vocabulary in his piano and chamber music compositions. For example, his symphonic variations Shneim-Asar Shivtei Yisrael (‚ÄòThe Twelve Tribes of Israel‚Äô, 1938), reflects the powerful rhetoric of late Romanticism with obvious influences from Brahms, Max Reger and Richard Strauss. The work was the first large-scale orchestral composition written in Palestine. His Capriccio for piano, a concise illustration of his style, displays a contrapuntal elaboration of two brief motifs in sonata-rondo form, with the movement's harmonic orientation stated by the two opening chords. However, even in his more radical chamber and piano works Sternberg never abandoned tonal orientation. Sternberg was critical of music critics and composers like Marc Lavry who believed that music should be communicative and thus relatively simple and comprehensible; musical compositions, he argued, should be dominated by melodies however complex. In an article published in Musica hebraica in 1938, Sternberg wrote that the composer should \\"go his own way and speak his own language from within, with high professional standards as his only goal\\".E.W. Sternberg: Shneim-Asar Shivtei Yisrael [The Twelve Tribes of Israel], Musica hebraica As a result, Sternberg's works do not reflect the simplicity of musical compositions in Palestine in the 1930s and 1940s. For example, his large-scale set of symphonic variations Yosef ve‚Ä≤Ehav (‚ÄòJoseph and his Brethren‚Äô, 1939) are dominated by strict contrapuntal devices which include complex fugues.P.V. Bohlman: The World Centre for Jewish Music in Palestine 1936‚Äì40 After 1940, Sternberg frequently turned back to earlier scores, revising many and using material from others for new compositions. Memorable works from the 1940s and 1950s are his vocal music works. Although he composed and arranged many Israeli folk songs, his treatment of the folk idiom reveals the strong influence of Fritz J√∂de's choral project and of the Gebrauchsmusik of Hindemith rather than that of the predominating folk ideology of searching for inspiration in Arabic and Mediterranean songs. For example, Sternberg's arrangement of Hora kuma (‚ÄòRise up, Brother‚Äô) by Shalom Postolsky is a set of six variations for seven-part chorus displaying contrapuntal and canonic textures, while his choral song Ima Adama (‚ÄòMother Earth‚Äô) features richly chromatic and modal harmony.P. Gradenwitz: The Music of Israel Sternberg's compositional output includes 2 string quartets, 6 orchestral works, several works for piano, works for chorus and orchestra, works for solo singer and orchestra, and numerous songs and folksong arrangements. He also wrote incidental music for the play Amcha (Your People) by S. Aleichem in 1936 and two operas, Dr. Doolittle (1939 Jerusalem) and Pacificia, the Friendly Island (1974). Most of his compositions are part of the collection at the Archives of Israeli Music at Tel Aviv University.

Overview Kobayashi began drawing manga seriously during his university years, and won an honorable mention at the Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine's Rookie Award in 2000, allowing him to serialize School Rumble. He stated to an audience at Honolulu's 2006 Kawaii Kon convention that he started writing the series because he found the idea of a manga involving a delinquent falling in love interesting. His favorite character, Kenji Harima, is based largely on an amalgam of various friends, although he estimates \\"about 30%\\" of Harima is a reflection of himself. However, despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters, he stated that Ryuhei Suga, a minor supporting character, is the most autobiographical. Most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates; Kobayashi recalled that he had no real idea of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until much later, when he heard the voice actors' interpretations during the production of the anime series, that he knew how they should sound. He acknowledged that some characters are more developed than others; in reply to a fan question about the mysterious Akira Takano, he admitted that, despite the closeness he feels for her, he did not put much emphasis on Takano and planned to develop her love-life slowly. Kobayashi intentionally centered his story arcs around misunderstandings which he then resolves, since he believes \\"if there's no misunderstanding then there's no funny story.\\" He claims that none of his stories are based on real-life events, although when pressed admits the possibility of some resemblances but without divulging specific details.

Though it was considered a historic home, it was demolished in 2011 by its last owner, Steve Jobs. Its demolition followed a protracted court battle during which Jobs stated his intentions to build a smaller, contemporary-styled home on the site, though he died before any plans could be realized. History The Jackling House designer, George Washington Smith, was the foremost creator and proponent of the Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style that became popular in the U.S. and remains so, especially in California and the Southwest. Based in Montecito, Smith helped create Santa Barbara's unified city planning and architectural aesthetic and many significant residences in the area in the 1920s.Herold, Ann. One Spanish Colonial Revival Architect Launched California Style.\\" The Los Angeles Times. February 2, 2006. Daniel Jackling was a copper mining baron, and the estate represented his aesthetic values, wealth, and family needs. It contained a built in residence pipe organ, originally constructed by the Aeolian Company and later enlarged by George Kilgen and Sons. George Washington Smith integrated the residence and landscaped gardens with a large traditional courtyard, open-air balconies, and many indoor- outdoor sightline and access connections. Details about the house and its contents when Jackling lived there, including the organ, are in his collected papers in the Stanford University Library.Guide to the Daniel C. (Daniel Cowan) Jackling Papers, 1911‚Äì1956 Stanford University Library, Special Collections After Jackling's wife Virginia died in 1957, the home was sold in 1958 and its surrounding land ‚Äì nearly ‚Äì was subdivided. The house had three other owners before its last one bought the property, which had a list price of $3.5 million, in 1984. Preservation issues =Background= In 1984 Steve Jobs purchased the Jackling House and estate, and resided there for a decade. After that, he leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house, allowing exposure to the weather to degrade it. In 2004, Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house in order to build a smaller, contemporary styled one. Local preservationists created a new group, \\"Uphold Our Heritage\\" (UOH), dedicated to saving the historic residence. They sued the town and Jobs, claiming that both had ignored provisions of California law which prohibit cultural landmarks from being destroyed if there are reasonable, feasible ways to preserve them. They also contended that the initial environmental impact report did not demonstrate that preserving the house would cost more than replacing it. \\"In addition, the town failed to demonstrate that demolishing the mansion would provide an 'overriding benefit' to the public, as required by state law\\", the group's attorney Doug Carstens said. \\"The issue before you is not to preserve and rehabilitate a work of marginal importance; it is to assure the protection and survival of a work of great significance\\", said the California Department of Parks and Recreation's State Historical Resources Commission chairperson Anthea Hartig, PhD. =Interim decisions= In January 2006, Superior Court Judge Marie Weiner agreed with \\"Uphold Our Heritage\\" and held that Jobs could not tear the house down. Jobs appealed to the State Court of Appeals, and in January 2007, that Court unanimously confirmed the lower court ruling. Jobs' attorney asked for an appeal but in April 2007, the Supreme Court of California refused to hear it. In 2008, Jobs submitted a renewed permit application with updated estimates. The Woodside Town Council granted the permit a year later, in May 2009, with the condition that Jobs must allow the house to be disassembled and moved elsewhere. In February 2010, Magalli and Jason Yoho offered to move the mansion to their five-acre lot in Woodside. Magalli Yoho reported in March that the house resembled a Spanish Colonial Revival mansion she lived in as a child in Ica, Peru. She said, \\"This house is just a good house for our family.\\" On March 8, 2010, Superior Court Judge Marie Weiner upheld the Woodside Town Council's 2009 decision that allowed Jobs to tear down his house. If an appeal was not filed before Jobs obtained a demolition permit, then demolition could proceed. The demolition permit process typically took \\"the better part of a couple of months\\", according to Woodside Town Manager Susan George. On April 29, 2010, \\"Uphold Our Heritage\\" appealed the March court decision. The appeal put an \\"automatic stay\\" on the issuance of demolition permits. The group hoped that the house could be relocated and restored. Demolition and legacy Later in 2010, Judge Weiner upheld the council's decision to allow the house to be demolished. The pipe organ was removed in January 2011, and the entire residence was demolished the next month. Nothing was built on the site, and Jobs died later that year on October 5, 2011, of pancreatic cancer. Laurene Powell Jobs proposed a new building for the site in 2016. The Woodside History Museum has an exhibit of furniture, maps, photographs, etc. from the Jackling House. The town of Woodside collected 150 items from the home before it was destroyed. As of October 2018, the items were reportedly appraised at over $30,000. At a meeting that month, the town council approved a plan to offer the items ‚Äì including a silver-plated teaspoon, a chandelier, wall sconces, door handles, a flagpole, and a 1920s thermostat and toilet ‚Äì in sequence to the town first, and then to the owners of another Smith-designed home next door. After that, the items would be offered to the museum of the University of California, Santa Barbara, which has additional Smith designs nearby. Remaining items would then be made available to the public via silent auction before being \\"sent to salvage\\".

Biography Huxtable was commissioned a Temporary Lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps in April 1915. He won the Military Cross in June 1917 and a bar in November 1917 whilst serving as a medical officer with the Lancashire Fusiliers during World War I. He resigned his commission as a Captain in April 1918. During World War II he was captured in Singapore by the Japanese and imprisoned in Changi Prison. Huxtable, then serving with the Royal Flying Doctor Service at Broken Hill, initiated the establishment of the Bush Children‚Äôs Education Foundation in 1965. He was shocked by the number of children who were not enrolled in any school and whose only contact with other children was through visits to a township. At that time there was no government provision for these children other than access to correspondence lessons. Huxtable, along with the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Leslie Herron, the Honourable Ian Sinclair and Ian Hardy, prepared a Trust Deed for the Foundation, which was approved by the NSW Attorney General. It provided funding for isolated children to board at the purpose-built Tibooburra Hostel. Other similar hostels were located in the far west of New South Wales. The Foundation appealed for individual and corporate donations so that bursaries could enable children to board at one of these hostels in order to attend a country school. In the early years the occupations of the families covered the range of outback working life: farmers, station hands, fencers, bore sinkers, kangaroo shooters, prospectors, miners, bush nurses, small business owners and itinerant circus/show people. Many of these occupations continue in the bush today, but now include parks and wildlife personnel and small business operators. Ahead of public opinion at the time, the Foundation supported and continues to encourage indigenous families to apply for bursaries. They included the descendants of the Wadikali and Karengappa people, original tribal groups from the north west corner of New South Wales.

They regularly appeared on In Siberia Tonight on SBS Television, The Sideshow with Paul McDermott on ABC Television and had guest appearances on Spicks and Specks and Adam Hills Tonight. During their act, the Kransky Sisters tell off-beat, macabre stories accompanied by cover versions of popular songs. The fictional sisters live an old-fashioned life style and travel in a 1958 Morris Major between performances. The trio's members play tuba, guitar, musical saw and a 1960s reed keyboard, as well as bizarre instruments such as toilet brushes and kitchen pots.  History  The Kransky Sisters were created by Annie Lee and Christine Johnston in Brisbane in 2000. Johnston grew up in Geebung, she provides \\"experimental vocals, including bird calls, and uses her voice as a medium by which visual objects and the subliminal or pedestrian aspects of human experience can be interpreted. In combination with this interest [she] brings to her performances a dramatic visual component and a strong sense of personal style and humour.\\" Leah Mercer of RealTime Arts caught their performance of Baggage in November 2005, she described \\"their earnest delivery and spot-on arrangements mean that the [trio] never descend into cheap parody; they play for laughs but never at their characters‚Äô expense. Full of memorable moments (Talking Heads' 'Psycho Killer', complete with yodeling and some wild Salvation Army tambourine moves, tops my list) Baggage unfolds as a series of stories gathered during the Kransky‚Äôs recent tour of regional Queensland. Continuing that great Australian tradition of the misfit hero.\\" = Fictional back story = The Kransky sisters come from Esk, a real rural town in Queensland. The two eldest sisters, Mourne and Eve Kransky, are full biological sisters and have lived together all their lives. Mourne and Eve's father was a travelling salesman for the (fictional) Asbestos Cookware Company. Their mother left their father to be with his brother, who is Arva and Dawn's father. The two brothers have not spoken since and Mourne and Eve ostracise Arva and Dawn, using their guilt over the affair to dominate them. Arva, who first toured with the family band, has now joined the Hornbell Military Marching Band. Dawn, the youngest sister, has taken leave from her job as trolley librarian at the Esk Hospital and now tours in Arva's place. The sisters wear the same clothes and Mourne and Eve speak with similar mannerisms. Mourne, the eldest, is clearly the matriarch, sternly keeping control of her younger sisters and doing most of the speaking during a concert, while Eve, a vegetarian who harbours secret passions, eerily echoes many of Mourne's phrases, though she has enough independence to occasionally add to Mourne's stories. Arva and Dawn almost never speak. The songs they play are learnt from listening to the \\"wireless\\" and they drive to their concerts in a 1958 Morris Major.

Lee was the MC, who according to Erin White of Australian Stage \\"captures the audience with her expressive face and amazing large, bright eyes. Her intermittent songs about dreams and the vastness of the universe, evidently project the WIV desire for women (and men) to follow their dreams and make their own destiny.\\" White observed that Johnston \\"performs dressed as an old school teacher; sings the Latin word for Tomato; and breaks out to 'What I Like About You', before performing her signature act ‚Äì playing the musical saw. The haunting and ringing sound of the saw complements [her] obscure persona. Her performance is stilted and disjointed, yet suits the character she is playing.\\" In June 2013 Johnston and two assistants, Peter Nelson and Lisa O'Neill, performed in a side project, 'RRamp - the Collector, the Archivist & the Electrocrat' , at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival. Mick Searles of AussieTheatre.com described the show, \\"Johnston sings skewed stories about chickens, tax receipts, scabs, kitchen utensils and her love of collecting and keeping things in jars (including skin from a suntan in 1978) in a wacky musical comedy.\\" From 2002 the trio of Johnston, Nelson and O'Neill have worked as the Gingham Family to perform a children's musical comedy, Fluff: A Story of Lost Toys. Johnston appeared as The Old Woman in Opera Queensland's (OQ) 2015 staged production of Leonard Bernstein's operetta Candide, directed by Lindy Hume.\\"Candide review (QPAC, Brisbane)\\" by Alison Cotes, Crikey, 27 July 2015 In 2017, Johnston played Mad Margaret in OQ's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore.\\"Review: Ruddigore (Opera Queensland)\\" by Suzannah Conway, Limelight, 14 July 2017 Annie Lee performed a solo set of shows, Barefoot Cabaret, in June 2015 providing \\"a night of gorgeous European cabaret with classics by everyone from Kurt Weill to Bertolt Brecht.\\" In another of Annie Lee's Cabaret shows 'Lighthouse Berlin' Lee performs a personal tribute to the extraordinary life of cabaret legend and friend Agnes Bernelle (1923-1999).

In the original print, the string player was instructed to play from an adjoining room from the pianist and singer, in order to create the effect of a distant angelic voice. Braga's \\"Angel's Serenade\\" has been recorded notably by tenor John McCormack and violinist Fritz Kreisler (in English), Jan Peerce and Mischa Elman (in English), Christian Ketter and Cara Schlecker (in Italian), Richard Tauber and Dajos Bela (in German).

Premise The show was about single dad Doug Brody (John Bedford Lloyd), who is abducted by single alien mom Cookie (Margaret Trigg). The two fall in love, get married, and try to live a normal life on Earth as a mixed family. Much of the series humor was derived from gags involving the assimilation of the alien family into everyday life‚Äîdespite being pink and having massive heads (all of the aliens were puppets designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop), everyone on Earth seems to accept their presence, and in spite of possessing technology far superior to that of Earth, the aliens all go about their everyday lives in the same fashion as all the humans. Although not the focus of the show, the character to receive the most attention in episodes was Bobut, Cookie's infant son. Baby Bobut could talk, had a genius-level IQ, and was perpetually plotting a grisly fate for those around him though the series position as a family show meant that Bobut's plans were always family-friendly: for example, wreaking havoc on the city by causing a frog to grow ten times its size. However the frog did grow so large that it ate a jetliner mid-flight, implying all passengers, and crew were eaten alive.

Brian Henson, son of Jim Henson, also served as co-executive producer. The series theme song was written and performed by Todd Rundgren. The series was shot in its entirety at Lifetime Studios in New York City. Episodes Cancellation The show premiered on March 15, 1996; ABC pulled the series from its TGIF lineup after two weeks, replacing the show's scheduled third airing with re-runs of other TGIF programs. The show did not return for over four months and aired the rest of its episodes on Saturday mornings in the summer of 1996. Jaleel White, who starred as Steve Urkel on another TGIF program (Family Matters), was a vocal critic of TGIF adding Jim Henson programs onto the TGIF block (Aliens in the Family debuted the same year as Muppets Tonight) and speculated that their addition ruined the block's credibility by changing its target demographic from whole families to children.

Now a historic house museum, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973, and is a contributing structure in Broad Street Historic District. Description and history Bellevue is located in central LaGrange, on an oval parcel located at the north end of Ben Hill Street, and flanked on both sides by McLendon Circle. It is a two-story wood frame structure with a two- story Greek temple front, featuring six fluted Ionic columns with four-sided capitals, and a heavy multi-level entablature below a dentillated cornice. Set within the temple front is a second-floor balcony with a turned balustrade, and a center entrance recessed in an opening flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature. Ells extend the house, joining it to what was once a separate kitchen building. Bellevue, originally a plantation estate, was established in 1853 by Benjamin Harvey Hill, one of Georgia's leading politicians of the antebellum and Civil War era. Its architect is only known by his last name, Taylor, and is one Georgia's finest example of antebellum Greek Revival architecture. Hill (1823‚Äì82), was a highly regarded orator and politician, who opposed secession in the years prior to the Civil War. When Georgia did secede from the Union, he served in the Senate of the Confederacy, and was opposed to Reconstruction Era legislation after the war. His house is now owned by the LaGrange Women's Club, which offers tours of the house and rentals for special events.

History  The group members met in 1992 in Berlin with group member Szary performing live acid house music at illegal underground parties, under the moniker Fundamental Knowledge. The group says, \\"After the Wall came down, everywhere in Germany and especially East Germany there was a lot of chaos, anarchy.\\" Both soon joined forces and began creating music as Modeselektor, a name taken from a function on the Roland Space Echo analog delay effects unit. In 1999 Modeselektor signed its first remix contract and began working with Pfadfinderei, a Berlin-based VJ and design collective. In 2000 Modeselektor met Ellen Allien, making BPitch Control their home label. Modeselektor has also been involved in collaborative efforts; Moderat - a musical collaboration between Modeselektor and Apparat, Pfadselektor - a music/visual collaboration between Modeselektor and Pfadfinderei, and with Rhythm & Sound's Paul St. Hillaire. They have produced sound installations at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and lectured at the Merz Akademie in Stuttgart. Modeselektor is a favourite group of Thom Yorke (frontman of Radiohead), who has recommended their albums in interviews and included the song \\"Silikon\\" (from their 2005 LP Hello Mom! and featuring vocalist Sasha Perera) in a publicly available iTunes playlist. Moderat (the collaboration between Modeselektor and Apparat) have also supported Radiohead on the band's concerts in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland and Prague, Czech Republic, in August 2009.

Other collaborators included Otto von Schirach, Siriusmo, and Apparat. In an interview that same year, the group said regarding their sound: \\"Happy metal, hard rap, country-ambient, Russian crunk. We don‚Äôt like it if people tag us as being a certain style or school or scene or whatever. We don‚Äôt really care about all that.\\" In March 2009, they released an album with Apparat under the name Moderat. They have collaborated previously on an EP named ' which was released as a limited 12\\" on BPitch Control in 2002. Modeselektor also appeared as main characters in Amy Grill's 2009 electronic music documentary, Speaking in Code.

It is open daily - excluding Mondays-without charge. The arboretum began as the private estate of businessman Jesse Tyson, who started construction of Cylburn Mansion in 1863. The house, designed by Baltimore City Hall architect George Aloysius Frederick, was eventually completed in 1888 and remains intact, a stone structure built of gneiss from Tyson's quarries at Bare Hills, with mansard roof, tower, and an Italianate cupola. It became the Cylburn Wildflower Preserve and Garden Center in 1954 and, in 1982, was renamed the Cylburn Arboretum Association. The Cylburn Mansion houses a display of watercolor paintings of Maryland wildflowers that is open to the public. Today the arboretum contains an extensive collection of trees and woody shrubs based loosely on the Tysons' original plantings. Collections include azaleas, bamboo, beeches, boxwoods, chestnuts, conifers, hollies, Japanese maples, magnolias, maples, Maryland oaks, and viburnum. The arboretum also includes a number of flower and vegetable gardens, as well as greenhouses designed and built in the 1960s by Lord & Burnham. The greenhouses grow plants for the city's parks, and are not open to the general public. The arboretum is included in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

It peaked at No. 22 in the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) created their own charts in mid-1988. In 1992, Kent back calculated chart positions for 1970‚Äì1974. It is their only album to feature Nick Ward on drums and has a harder, more new wave influenced sound than their later material, although Kilbey's semi-surreal lyrics are already present. It was produced by Chris Gilbey and Bob Clearmountain. Seven songs were entirely written by lead singer and bass guitarist Steve Kilbey and two were co-written with others. The first single, \\"She Never Said\\", did not chart on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. The second single, \\"The Unguarded Moment\\", was co- written with Mikela Uniacke (aka Michelle Parker), Note: User may have to search again and provide details at 'Titles' e.g Unguarded Moment; or at 'Performers' Church who was married to Steve Kilbey at the time. This song launched the band to success and has been their biggest hit to date. It brought early attention and significant radio play to the band, it peaked at No. 22 in Australia and No. 19 in New Zealand. The track \\"Is This Where You Live\\" became a live staple over the following years. By the time of the album's release, Ward had been replaced on drums by Richard Ploog. The album was re-sequenced and released internationally as The Church in 1982. Background In Sydney, in March 1980, singer, bass guitarist and songwriter Steve Kilbey bumped into guitarist Peter Koppes, an old bandmate from his Canberra days. Koppes was playing with another Canberran, drummer Nick Ward, in a Sydney band called Limazine. The three decided to form a new band, called it The Church (originally The Church of Man) and began performing. A month later, Marty Willson-Piper, originally from Liverpool, United Kingdom, came to one of their gigs and was invited to join on second guitar. A four-song demo was recorded in Kilbey's bedroom studio. Thanks to contacts from Kilbey & Koppes' former band Baby Grande, they sent the tape to the Australian branch of publishing company ATV Northern Songs. The song \\"Chrome Injury\\" attracted the attention of managing director Chris Gilbey, who had recently formed a record production company in association with EMI Records in Australia and resurrected the Parlophone label. Note: [On-line] version has limited preview. Gilbey signed the band, went to band rehearsals and helped shape their sound by buying Willson-Piper a 12 string Rickenbacker guitar and Koppes an Echolette tape delay. Sessions for their first album followed in late 1980. Of the four songs originally demoed, only \\"Chrome Injury\\" was included. The album, Of Skins and Heart, was co-produced by Gilbey and Bob Clearmountain (Bryan Adams). Seven of the nine tracks were written solely by Kilbey. The first single, \\"She Never Said\\", was released in November, but did not chart. The second single, \\"The Unguarded Moment\\", co-written with Kilbey's girlfriend Michelle Parker, was issued alongside the album in March 1981, initially only in Australia. \\"The Unguarded Moment\\" reached No. 22 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart while Of Skins and Heart achieved the same position on the related Albums Chart. To promote their releases, the band undertook their first national tour. By the time of the album's release, drummer Ward had already been replaced by Richard Ploog. He was recruited by their manager, Michael Chugg, after hearing of his reputation in Adelaide. Ploog's arrival established The Church's first stable line-up. The first recordings by the group with Ploog were eventually released as a five-track double single / extended play, Too Fast for You in July 1981. It included the first collectively written track, \\"Sisters\\". Another track, \\"Tear It All Away\\", later released as a separate single, showed a development towards more elaborate guitar structures and what would become the signature Church sound. Their image of tight jeans and paisley shirts (many designed and made by Michelle Parker), as well as their 'jangly' guitar sound evoked comparisons to 1960s psychedelic groups, particularly The Byrds. The success of Of Skins and Heart enabled Chris Gilbey to present the release to Freddie Cannon of French label Carrere and Rupert Perry of American label Capitol. Both labels released the album in 1982, renamed as simply The Church, with slightly altered track listings including songs from Too Fast for You and using a crop of that EP's artwork for the cover. Ploog was incorrectly credited as the sole drummer on the release, despite only playing on one or three tracks, depending on the version. Capitol also released an edited single version of \\"The Unguarded Moment\\" which was a minute shorter than the original ‚Äì a decision which displeased the band.

The League of Communists was founded in 14.9.2002 by the Communists who were expelled from the For Peace and Socialism - Communist Workers Party (KTP). The organization was at first known as, plainly, Communists (Kommunistit) but the name was changed to its current form during the registration process. The dispute in the KTP arose as part of its Central Committee wished the party would join a new electoral alliance party (Forces for Change in Finland [MVS]) in which right-wing organizations were also participating. The majority led by chairman Hannu Harju did not approve of this and the Central Committee voted (18-9) against the initiative. The minority, including the Helsinki district organization, the main force behind the project, chose not to respect the decision, and it was expelled. The expelled Helsinki district later participated in the founding of the MVS. Some notable persons among the expelled were Heikki M√§nnikk√∂ (the party secretary), Reijo Katajaranta (the editor-in-chief of the KTP organ) and Pekka Tiainen (the 1994 presidential candidate). In 2005, the (former) Turku district organization of the KTP joined the League of Communists. Both parties adhere to traditional orthodox Marxism-Leninism and support, for example, North Korea as an anti-imperialist bastion. The KTP has, however, chosen not to cooperate with their former comrades who they regard as revisionist traitors. The League of Communists has had to find their allies elsewhere. The MVS was no success and after the general elections of 2003 the league has collaborated with several organizations, like the Communist Party of Finland (SKP) on whose list the League of Communists candidates stood in the elections to European Parliament in 2004. The only elected local councillor of the league, Antti Siika-Aho, stood (in 2004) as a Left Alliance candidate. As the new organization was set in motion, a newspaper, called Kansan √Ñ√§ni, was also founded. The bimonthly paper, the editor-in-chief of which is Reijo Katajaranta, looks very similar to KTP's Ty√∂kansan Sanomat. Kansan √Ñ√§ni is also published by two other organizations controlled by members of the League of Communists. These are the People's Front Against European Union (EUVKr) and Work Against War and Fascism (SFT), the latter of which was founded after World War II by former Communist resistance fighters. Since its beginning the League of Communists has been led by Kalevi Wahrman whose board includes only men. The organization acts like a political party although it is not officially registered as one, an option which, however, has not been excluded.

They are traditionally a coastal community who were engaged in seafaring, fishing and naval warfare. They are known for their maritime history and are reputed as a warrior caste who constituted as the generals and captains of the Aryacakravarti dynasty. The Karaiyars were also the major maritime traders and boat owners who among other things, traded with pearls, chanks, tobacco, and shipped goods overseas to countries such as India, Myanmar and Indonesia. The Karaiyars emerged in the 1980s as strong representatives of Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism. The nuclear leadership of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have background in the wealthier enterprising section of the Karaiyars. Historically, they have also been referred to as Kurukulam, Varunakulam and Karaiyalar. Sharing similar origins and status are the Sinhalese Karava and the Pattanavar of Tamil Nadu.  Etymology  The word \\"Karaiyar\\" is derived from the Tamil language words karai (\\"coast\\" or \\"shore\\") and yar (\\"people\\"). The term Kareoi mentioned by 2nd century AD writer Ptolemy, is identified with the Tamil word \\"Karaiyar\\". The Portuguese and Dutch sources mentions them under the term Careas, Careaz, or Carias, which are terms denoting \\"Karaiyar\\". Kurukulam, Varunakulam and Arasakulam were historically one of the significant clans of the Karaiyars. Kurukulam, meaning \\"clan of the Kuru\\", may be a reference to their origin from Kurumandalam (meaning \\"realm of Kuru's\\") of Southern India. They attribute their origin myth from the Kuru Kingdom, mentioned in Hindu epic Mahabharata. Some scholars derived Kurukulam from Kuru, the Tamil name for Jupiter. Varunakulam, meaning \\"clan of Varuna\\", is a reference to their maritime origin. Varuna is the god of sea and rain, mentioned in Vedic Literature, but also in Sangam literature as the principal deity of the Neithal Sangam landscape (i.e. littoral landscape). Arasakulam means \\"clan of kings\\".  History  = Ancient era = The Karaiyar, are among the old coastal communities who inhabited the Neithal Sangam landscape. The ancient Tamil literature mentions several coastal populations, but does not contain any direct references to the Karaiyars. Migration of Karaiyars from South India to Sri Lanka started from around second century BCE. The earliest reference to them could be the 1st century BCE Tamil Householders Terrace, Pali inscription in Anuradhapura referring to several Tamil chiefs including one named \\"Dameda navika Karava\\", translated as \\"Tamil Karayar sailor\\". The Purananuru mentions \\"Karaiyavar\\", but not as a coastal population; in the later literature, the word came to be identified with coastal people. Ptolemy mentions Korkai, the capital port of the Pandyan kings, as the chief seat of the Karaiyars. = Medieval era = Several inscriptions mention high-ranked military officials under the title Kurukulattaraiyan (meaning \\"King of Kurukulam\\"). An inscription in Tirumukkudal, Tamil Nadu mentions a notability named Kurukulattaraiyan who 'wore a golden anklet' as the commander of the army of Vijayabahu I (11th century AD) who ended the Chola rule in Sri Lanka. Another Kurukulattaraiyan, Choran Uyyaninraduvan, the minister of Maravarman Sundara Pandyan (13th century AD) is mentioned as gifting land and making offerings for the Ninra Narayana Perumal temple in an epigraphy of the temple. The same minister is also mentioned in an inscription issued by Jatavarman Kulasekaran I. According to an account given in the Mukkara Hatana manuscript, a battalion of 7740 Karaiyar soldiers came from Kurumandalam in Southern India, and defeated the Mukkuvars (another coastal community) and Sonakars (Tamil Muslims). The Yalpana Vaipava Malai states that Parakramabahu VI of Kotte invited Karaiyar battalions to facilitate trade with other countries. The Karaiyars also formed alliances with coastal military castes from Tamil Nadu such as the Maravars. The Maravars who had strong influence in Northern Sri Lanka, established themselves as trading and sea lords and assimilated into the Karaiyar caste. A 13th century inscription of Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I in Tharangambadi, Tamil Nadu makes a reference to the Karaiyars along with the mercantile guild Patinenvisayattar making food offerings to the Masilamaninathar temple. The Vaiya Padal mentions the voyage of a Karaiyar chief known as MeekƒÅman, who traveled with ships loaded with several castes and chiefs, including the Karaiyars who make reference as Varunakulaththar. Another Karaiyar chief also known as MeekƒÅman is credited for leading a troop of Chola soldiers and defeating the powerful Mukkuvar chiefs Vediarasan and Meera. According to one version was this strife caused because of a Pandya ruler who sent Meekaman to obtain a Naga gemstone for Kannagi (the heroine of Silappatikaram). A destroyed fort at Neduntheevu, the Delft Island fort is locally known as Meekaman k≈çttai, and is thought to have been the fort of Meekaman. According to Mattakallappu Manmiyam, Kalinga Magha (founder of Aryacakravarti dynasty) gave the principality of Mannar to those of the Kurukulam lineage. The Karaiyars in alliance with the Paravars were in control of the port-based trade and the pearl fishery conducted in the Gulf of Mannar under the Jaffna Kingdom, which were one of the worlds major pearl fisheries. = Colonial era = Statue of king Cankili II in Jaffna The Karaiyars were by the Portuguese described as the most \\"warlike\\" tribe and their chiefs as most serious adversaries of the colonial Portuguese. The Karaiyars revolted six times against the Portuguese in the conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, who aligned and also commanded over the troops of Thanjavur Nayak Kingdom, whose king was Raghunatha Nayak. The first revolt led by a Karaiyar chieftain who was defeated near Nallur by Phillippe de Oliveira and his army. The second revolt against them was led by the Karaiyar chief Migapulle Arachchi, a feudal lord of Jaffna Kingdom who also led the third revolt. A later revolt was started by the Karaiyars and the Thanjavur Nayak troops of over 5000 men, commanded by the Karaiyar chief, Varunakulattan, one described by the Portuguese as being of kingly status. The Portuguese ordered Cankili II, king of Jaffna Kingdom, to surrender the Thanjavur Nayak soldiers and Varunakulattan (who is described as \\"King of Careas\\"). However Cankili II did not surrender them as they had come on his request, and were later on defeated by the Portuguese. Upon defeat were significant numbers of Karaiyars along with the Nairs and Karavas appointed as Lascarins under Portuguese rule, and were converted to Catholicism. In the Jaffna region, the Karaiyars were a dominant caste and were considered as upper-class in the social hierarchy, where converson to Christianity of sections of them allowed them to grow closer to the Portuguese in power. After the expulsion of the Portuguese, was the growing Dutch rule revolted in 1658 in the Jaffna region by the Christian Karaiyars and Madapallis. A Dutch minister of the 17th century, Philippus Baldaeus, described the Karaiyars, Madapallis and Vellalars among the influential classes of the Christians. Elite Karaiyars were appointed to the rank of Mudaliyars. The Karaiyar dominance got weakened through the political rise of the Vellalars under Dutch rule. For centuries have the Karaiyars had sea-trade relations with India but also Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, which has been heavily restricted since British rule. = Modern era = In the 20th century, the Karaiyar were the second largest group of voters among the Sri Lankan Tamils after the Vellalar. The Karaiyars formed around 10% of the population, while the dominant Vellalars constituted about 50% of the population. The Karaiyars dominated the political scene of the Tamils in the late 20th century through the liberation struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam state for Tamils as a result of government sponsored riots and acts such as the 1958 anti-Tamil pogrom and the Standardisation act. Educated Karaiyar youths from Jaffna Peninsula took to militancy as means of protest and formed separatist groups such as TELO, EROS, EPRLF and the world renowned LTTE, also widely known as the Tamil Tigers. The fact that the core leadership of the LTTE had Karaiyar origin (e.g. the leader of the LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran), enabled them to develop a strong Sea Tiger force due to their traditional knowledge on seafaring and the waterways of the Palk Strait. They benifted greatly from their kinship and long trade relation with the seafaring and militant communities of the Coromandel Coast, enabling them to setup training camps in coastal regions of Tamil Nadu and exploit the sea for weapon smuggling. Through their kinship to the Karaiyar landlord class in Batticaloa region, the LTTE also gained recruitment of Eastern Tamils. Although having a significant Karaiyar representation, the LTTE promoted Tamil unity through anti-casteism and recruited without caste and regional distinctions, and thus ensured them to be the representative of the Tamil society as a whole compared to the other Tamil militant groups.  Customs  Makara flag of the Karaiyars The Karaiyars were assigned the western section (present day Gurunagar) and the harbors of the Jaffna Kingdom. The Karaiyars formed the generals of the Jaffna kings and officered the navy of the Aryacakravarti dynasty. They used the Makara as emblem, the mount of their clan deity, the sea god Varuna, which was also seen on their flags. Kannaki Amman is one of the chief deity of the Hindu Karaiyars whereas Francis Xavier and Virgin mary are one of the chief saints of the Christian Karaiyars. The Karaiyars in Northern Sri Lanka are classified into two groups: the Meelongi and the Keelongi. The Melongi Karaiyars are some areas known as Thevar Karaiyar and Kurukula Karaiyar, who were descendants of commanders, while Keelongi Karaiyars were descendants of the army's soldiers and workers. The Karaiyars in Eastern Sri Lanka like other castes are divided into kudi's or matrilineal clans. The Eastern Karaiyars almost exclusively also use the term Vaiyittu Var (Tamil for \\"womb-tie\\") as a synonymous term for kudi or clan. The chieftains and village headmen of the Karaiyars held the title Pattankattiyar, meaning \\"One who is crowned\\" in Tamil. Other titles they used were Adappanar, Mudaliar, Pillai, Kurukulattan and Varunakulattan. The Adappans along with the Pattankattiyar were headmen who were responsible of the harbors and pearl fishery of the northern and western parts of Sri Lanka. At the hand of the powerful maritime trading clans of the Karaiyars, the emergence of urban centers known as pattanam were seen. Pattanavar (literally meaning \\"pattanam- residents\\"), is an almost extinct caste name also used by the Karaiyars. Mudaliar (meaning \\"capitalist\\") were conferred on the maritime elite trading clans of the Karaiyars as titles of nobility. The domestic servants of the Karaiyars, who are known as Kudimakkal include the castes of Ambattar, Vannar, Maraiyar, Koviar and Nattuvar. They gave importance in their ritual roles as officiators under the wedding and funeral.

Note: Archived [on- line] copy has limited functionality. Moving away from the new wave leanings of their debut, it was stylistically more complex and \\"a smoother, fuller release\\". \\"With its mystical lyrics the second album ... brought the group's own style more into focus\\". The album peaked at No. 10 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and \\"Almost With You\\" reached No. 21 on the related Singles Chart.

In 1992, Kent back calculated chart positions for 1970‚Äì1974.  Background  While still dominated primarily by Steve Kilbey's songwriting, The Blurred Crusade shows a stronger influence from 1960s psychedelia and the beginnings of guitarists Peter Koppes' and Marty Willson- Piper's trademark interplay. Lush keyboards, which often imitate strings or vocals, provide an ethereal background, aided by Bob Clearmountain's rich, atmospheric production. The album's opening track and first single, \\"Almost with You,\\" is considered one of the band's most characteristic songs and the two whole-band compositions, \\"An Interlude\\" and \\"You Took\\", have been frequently included in set lists throughout their career. Both the band and a large section of the fan-base cite the album as one of their finest. Following its release, the band undertook their second Australian tour, while Carrere Records released the album in Europe, generating enough sales for them to tour there in October. However, their U.S. label, Capitol Records, declined to release The Blurred Crusade and demanded that they write more radio-friendly material, as exemplified by their stable mates, Little River Band. This horrified the group. Note: [On-line] version has limited preview. After another recording session, five new songs were offered to Capitol, but the label was still unimpressed and dropped the band. The five songs were later released in Australia as the EP Sing-Songs, which reached the Top 100 Albums Chart in December. Meanwhile, their manager, Michael Chugg, arranged a UK tour supporting the hugely successful pop group Duran Duran, but after five gigs The Church pulled out, feeling that the audiences were unsympathetic. Chugg later recalled, \\"They were hard work. All four of them were strong-willed and had their own ideas of how things should be\\". In October 2010, The Blurred Crusade (1982) was listed in the book 100 Best Australian Albums, along with their 1988 album, Starfish, in the Top 40.

It is the junction between four bones: * the parietal bone * the squamous part of temporal bone * the greater wing of sphenoid bone * the frontal bone These bones are typically joined by five cranial sutures: * the sphenoparietal suture joins the sphenoid and parietal bones * the coronal suture joins the frontal bone to the sphenoid and parietal bones * the squamous suture joins the temporal bone to the sphenoid and parietal bones * the sphenofrontal suture joins the sphenoid and frontal bones * the sphenosquamosal suture joins the sphenoid and temporal bones Clinical significance The pterion is known as the weakest part of the skull. The anterior division of the middle meningeal artery runs underneath the pterion. Consequently, a traumatic blow to the pterion may rupture the middle meningeal artery causing an epidural haematoma. The pterion may also be fractured indirectly by blows to the top or back of the head that place sufficient force on the skull to fracture the pterion. Etymology The pterion receives its name from the Greek root pteron, meaning wing. In Greek mythology, Hermes, messenger of the gods, was enabled to fly by winged sandals, and wings on his head, which were attached at the pterion.

The seven fires of the prophecy represent key spiritual teachings for North America, and suggest that the different colors and traditions of the human beings can come together on a basis of respect. It contains information for the future lives of the Anishinaabe which are still in the process of being fulfilled.Bell, Nicole. Journey from the Heart: Sharing the Anishnaabe (Ojibway) Culture With the Public School System. April 2000, Queen's University. In 1988, Edward Benton-Banai documented the prophecy in The Mishomis Book. Overview Originally, the prophecy and the Ojibwa migration story were closely linked. However, the last half of the prophecy appears to apply to all peoples in contact with the Anishinaabeg. Consequently, with the growth of the Pan-Indian Movement in the 1960s and the 1970s, concepts of the Seven fires prophecy merged with other similar prophetical teaching found among Indigenous peoples of North America forming a unified environmental, political, and socio-economic voice towards Canada and the United States. The Seven fires prophecy was originally taught among the practitioners of Midewiwin. William Commanda, an Algonquin elder and former chief of the Kitig√†n-z√¨b√¨ Anishin√†beg First Nation, was the wampum belt keeper for the seven fires prophecy. He died on August 3, 2011.Toensing, Gale Courey. \\"Political Party! Celebrating UNDRIP and Indigenous Culture in Montreal\\". Indian Country Today. 13 Sept 2011 (retrieved 27 Sept 2011)  Seven fires  Originally, the prophecies were given by eight prophets in seven different time periods. According to oral tradition, the Mi'kmaq Nation heard the first Prophet. The remaining seven prophets appeared before and were recorded by the Anishinaabeg. A prophecy of each of these seven periods were then called a \\"fire\\". The teachings of the Seven fires prophecy also state that when the world has been befouled and the waters turned bitter by disrespect, human beings will have two options to choose from, materialism or spirituality. If they chose spirituality, they will survive, but if they chose materialism, it will be the end of it. = First = In heeding this prophecy, the Anishinaabe peoples, after receiving guarantees of the safety of their \\"Fathers\\" (the Abenaki peoples) and their \\"allied brothers\\" (Mi'kmaq) of having the Anishinaabeg move inland, away from the Atlantic coast, mass migration of the Anishinaabeg took place, proceeding to the \\"First Stopping Place\\" known as Mooniyaang, known today as Montreal, Quebec. There, the Nation found a \\"turtle-shaped island\\" marked by miigis (cowrie) shells. The Nation grew to a large number and spread up both Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River. The second of the \\"turtle-shaped island\\" marked by miigis shells was at Niagara Falls. = Second = The oral traditions of the members of Council of Three Fires say that the realization of the Second fire came about the \\"Third Stopping Place\\" located somewhere near what now is Detroit, Michigan. The Anishinaabeg had divided between those who went up Ottawa River and those that went up the St. Lawrence River. After leaving the area about Niagara Falls, this group proceeded to the \\"Round Lake\\" (Lake St. Clair) and found the third \\"turtle-shaped island\\" marked by miigis shells. They continued westward until arriving along the southern shores of Lake Michigan but by this time, the evidence of the miigis shells were lost, and the southern Anishinaabeg became \\"lost\\" both physically in their journey as well as spiritually in their journey. The southern group of Anishinaabeg disintegrated into what today are the Ojibwa, Odawa and the Potawatomi. The northern group along the Ottawa River divided into Algonquin, Nipissing and the Mississaugas, but they maintained cohesion that was not maintained by the southern group. Eventually, a Potawatomi boy had a dream and pointed the southern group back towards and past the \\"Round Lake\\". The southern group rejoined not as a single Anishinaabe peoplehood but rather as a unified alliance called Council of Three Fires. Travelling east and north, and then west, the Council crossed a series of small islands known as \\"the stepping stones\\" until they arrived onto Manitoulin island, described as the \\"Fourth Stopping Place\\" of the \\"turtle- shaped island\\" marked by miigis shell. There on the island, the Council met up with the Mississaugas, who then spiritually fully re-aligned the formerly lost southern group with the northern group who were never lost. The Odawa facilitated the \\"healing\\" and the island became synonymous as the \\"Odawa's Island\\" in the Anishinaabe language. = Third = From the cultural center on Manitoulin Island, the Ojibwe moved to the area about Sault Ste. Marie, where there was the next \\"turtle-shaped island\\" marked by miigis shell. Baawating or \\"The Rapids\\" of the Saint Marys River became the \\"Fifth Stopping Place\\" of the Ojibwe. From this spot, the Ojibwe and the rapids became synonymous with each other, with the Ojibwe known by the Dakota peoples as Iyo-·∏£a·∏£ato≈ãwa≈ã (\\"cascading-waterfalls people\\") and later by the French as Saulteurs (\\"cascaders\\") and Saulteaux (\\"cascades\\"). From here, the Ojibwe moved west, dividing into two groups, each travelling along the shores of Lake Superior, searching for the \\"land where food grows upon the waters\\". = Fourth = The Fourth fire prophecy was delivered by a pair of prophets. The first prophet said, The other prophet said, While at the \\"Fifth Stopping Place\\", the light- skinned people in big wooden boats, known as the French arrived. Consequently, the French were called Wemitigoozhii (\\"wooden-boat people\\"). Though the French Crown was interested in colonialism, as far as the Anishinaabeg were concerned, the French appeared only interested in commerce and trade through mercantilism. Together with the French, the Anishinaabeg formed trade alliances, which not only extended French colonial powers into the heart of North America, but strengthened the political and military might of the Anishinaabeg. After the French came the Zhaaganaash (\\"Off-shore ones\\") of Great Britain. But out of the Zhaaganaash came the Gichi-mookomaan (\\"Big- knives\\")‚Äîthe Virginians (i.e. Americans). = Fifth = = Sixth = = Seventh = The Seventh Prophet that came to the people long ago was said to be different from the other prophets. This prophet was described as \\"young and had a strange light in his eyes\\" and said:  Notes  References * Benton-Banai, Edward, The Mishomis Book - The Voice of the Ojibway (St. Paul: Red School House Publishers, 1988). * Buffalohead, Roger and Priscilla Buffalohead, Against the Tide of American History: The Story of Mille Lacs Anishinabe.

He has been a coach and manager at several English clubs and was manager of the England team that won the FIFA Under-20s World Cup in South Korea in 2017. He is currently assistant head coach at Bristol City, alongside Keith Downing. His son Jake Simpson is also a former professional, now Head of Fitness at National League side AFC Fylde. Playing career =Manchester City= Simpson began his playing career as a schoolboy at Manchester City in the early 1980s. He made his senior debut aged 16, on 2 October 1982 in a 3‚Äì2 win against Coventry City. However, after the club were relegated and new manager Billy McNeill arrived, Simpson, along with John Beresford, was briefly loaned out to Irish club Finn Harps to gain more experience. He scored 3 goals in 9 total appearances at Finn Park. He returned during the final stages of 1984‚Äì85 campaign and enjoyed a run of games as he scored 6 times in just 10 appearances as City won promotion from the Second Division. He was a regular member of the first team in the 1985-86 season and scored nine First Division goals as City survived their first season back in the top flight, although they were relegated a year later. He won five caps for the England under-21 team during his spell at Maine Road, adding to three caps at under-18 level. His U21 debut came on 26 March 1986 as a substitute against Denmark on his home ground. He also played in the 1987 Toulon Tournament, during which he scored. =Oxford United= He left City, now back in the Second Division, for Oxford United in October 1988 in a ¬£200,000 deal, after making 155 appearances for them in total. He remained at Oxford for over four years ‚Äì all spent in the second tier ‚Äì before signing for Derby County in February 1992 for ¬£500,000. =Derby County= The winger joined Derby in the midst of a promotion challenge but, despite finishing 3rd, they lost in the play-offs to 6th-placed Blackburn Rovers. The club had three more successive failed promotion attempts (including losing the 1994 play-off final to rivals Leicester City) before they won automatic promotion in 1995‚Äì96. He was a first choice player throughout this period, and twice reached double figures in his goal return. The influx of new players that followed the Rams' promotion to the Premier League saw his place under fire for the first time since he had joined. He managed 19 appearances (scoring twice, including Derby's first game back at the top level) during their return to the top flight, but also found himself out on loan at second tier club Sheffield United to gain more playing time. =Wolves= After failing to feature in the opening months of the Rams' 1997‚Äì98 season, he dropped down a division to join Wolverhampton Wanderers initially on a month's loan in October 1997. After impressing with 2 goals in 8 starts, he signed a permanent deal for ¬£75,000. His first season with the club also saw him almost appear in an FA Cup Final, but they lost to eventual winners Arsenal in the semi-final. His second season at Molineux was less successful as he found himself out of the starting line-up in the opening games. He went on loan to nearby Walsall of the Second Division for four months, but returned to Wolves first team when this loan expired. He scored Wolves' final goal of the season in a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Bradford City that meant they missed out on the play-offs. =Blackpool= After a second successive 7th-place finish in a season that saw Simpson feature only sparingly, he signed for Blackpool on a free transfer in August 2000. Here, he helped the club win promotion from the Third Division via the play-offs in his first season but he left during his second, to join Rochdale in March 2002. Just before leaving the club he helped them win the 2001‚Äì02 Football League Trophy, playing as a substitute in the final. =Rochdale= He made nine appearances in the final games of the 2001‚Äì02 season for Dale, scoring 6 times. This goal rush helped push the club into the play-offs, where they lost to Rushden & Diamonds (despite another goal from Simpson). Managerial career =Rochdale= After manager John Hollins departed from Rochdale in 2002, Simpson stepped in as player-manager. He began the season in equally bright goal-scoring form, but as the pressure of management took its toll and he enjoyed a largely unsuccessful season. Simpson left Rochdale after only season in charge where they reached the FA Cup 5th round, an equal club record, but finished 19th after a late turnaround by Macclesfield saw them drop from 13th in the final 10minutes of the season. =Carlisle United= Following his departure from Rochdale, Simpson moved back to his home town, where he became the manager of Carlisle United. He also played for the club. Carlisle were relegated to the Conference in his first year at Brunton Park, at a time when the club was struggling financially. A transfer embargo prevented new players being brought in and by December Carlisle were 15 points adrift, and despite an improved latter half of the season, the club were eventually relegated. However, he immediately led Carlisle back to League Two in 2004‚Äì05 as Conference National Playoff winners. Following this, Simpson enjoyed perhaps his best season as a manager, leading Carlisle to double ‚Äì promotion, winning promotion to League One as League Two champions. He was also named as the League Two Manager of the Year and in the League Managers Association statistics was the best manager in the country on points per game above Rafael Ben√≠tez. Simpson played his final game as a professional player on 6 May 2006 at Edgeley Park against Stockport County, the club he later managed, on a day where the 2 teams drew 0 ‚Äì 0, meaning that Carlisle were promoted as champions, and Stockport survived relegation from the Football League. This marked the end of his playing career after 24 years. =Preston North End= In June 2006, following his success at Carlisle, Simpson left the club to replace Billy Davies as manager of Preston North End, where he led the Lancashire side to the top of the Championship by December, their highest league placing for 55 years. However, after only being able to bring 3 free transfers in January they were unable to maintain this position and missed out on the play-offs by goal difference despite beating already promoted Birmingham on the last day. After losing key player David Nugent, the team made a bad start to the 2007‚Äì08 season (including just three victories) resulting in Simpson being sacked on 13 November 2007. =Shrewsbury Town= On 12 March 2008, he was appointed manager of League Two club Shrewsbury Town, replacing Gary Peters who had left the club by mutual consent after a poor run of results. After helping them avoid relegation in his first season, Simpson then took them to the Play-off Final where they lost to a last minute Gillingham goal. In the following campaign after an overall decent first half of the season, Shrewsbury were dealt six straight defeats in March and April, ultimately costing them a place in the play-offs. He was dismissed as manager on 30 April 2010. =Stockport County= Simpson was confirmed as the new manager of Stockport County on 12 July 2010 following a takeover by The 2015 Group. He replaced former manager Gary Ablett, who was sacked by the club's new owners after the club spent the entire season in administration ‚Äì the worst season in the club's history, with County gaining just 25 points from 46 games. Simpson was charged with the task of staying in the division and rebuilding a squad which has been ravaged by administration, and ensuring the survival of the club in League Two in the coming season. He was instructed to work with Peter Ward as his assistant manager, and former youth team manager Alan Lord was put in charge of Youth Development. Both Ward and Lord were returning to County having previously worked there under former manager Jim Gannon between 2005 and 2009. Ward was also a former Stockport captain, playing for the club in the 1990s. Simpson also employed former coach Stuart Delaney as Youth Team Manager. Simpson made his first new signing as County boss on 14 July 2010, bringing former Hull City right-back Mark Lynch from Rotherham United on a free transfer. Simpson was sacked on 4 January 2011 after a run of just three wins in 19 games. =Northwich Victoria= Simpson was appointed manager of Northern Premier League Premier Division side Northwich Victoria on 1 February 2012, with Alan Wright as his assistant. However, he departed after only a month as he had been due to take up a role in Portugal at the end of the season. This was, however, brought forward to March, meaning Simpson left following the club's FA Trophy Quarter-final match on Saturday 25 February. His assistant, Alan Wright, oversaw a match with Rushall Olympic during Simpson's absence. =Newcastle United= On 3 July 2015, Simpson was appointed as one of Steve McClaren's assistant coaches along with Ian Cathro, after leaving Derby County. =England U20= Simpson took charge of the England Under 20 Squad in 2017 and won the U20 World Cup in Suwon, South Korea on 11 June 2017, beating Venezuela by the only goal of the game. Simpson left his post on the 10th August 2020, to become assistant head coach to Dean Holden at Bristol City.

He was hanged in the Crumlin Road Gaol for his involvement in the killing of Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) police officer named Patrick Murphy during the Northern Campaign. Early years A Plaque over 46 Bombay Street - where Tom Williams lived with his grandmother. Williams was born at 6 Amcomri Street in the Beechmount area of Belfast in 1923. He was the third child in a family of six. His brother Richard was the eldest, his sister Mary died of meningitis at the age of three. Williams' mother Mary died, at the age of 29, after giving birth to his sister Sheila, who also died shortly after.Jim McVeigh, Executed Tom Williams and the IRA, Beyond the Pale Publications, Belfast, After the death of his mother, Williams and his brother then went to live with their grandmother at 46 Bombay Street in the Clonard area of Belfast. Williams family had had to leave the small Catholic enclave in the Shore Road area of Belfast before moving to Beechmount, after their house was attacked and burnt. According to Williams's biographer, Jim McVeigh, because of its defencelessness this enclave saw some of the most awful atrocities of the period, the most infamous occurring in February 1922 when loyalists threw a bomb into a group of Catholic children playing in Weaver Street, killing a number of them and grievously injuring many more. The Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor Dr MacRory, remonstrated and was quoted as saying \\"the butchery of my people\\". Williams's uncle Terry Williams was jailed for his part in defending the Shore Road enclave during this period. As a child, Williams suffered from asthma and as a result was often very ill. He attended St Gall's Primary School but left at an early age to obtain work, which at the time was difficult due to discrimination. His work therefore consisted of labouring and as a delivery boy. Na Fianna √âireann As soon as Williams was old enough, he joined Na Fianna √âireann, the republican Scout Organisation founded by Countess Markievicz in 1909, becoming a member of the Con Colbert slua in the Clonard area. Alfie Hannaway, a friend of Williams was his OC in Na Fianna, and assigned Williams to the rank of Quartermaster for the company. Williams took his role in Na Fianna very seriously and all who came to know him were struck by his dedication and maturity, even at this early age. Most of his activities in Na Fianna took place in a small hall in Kane Street, just off Bombay Street. There they spent their time drilling, attending lectures in history, and sometimes scouted for the Irish Republican Army (IRA). With their own money the boys were able to equip the hall with a boxing ring, PT equipment and some tables and chairs. IRA activity At the age of 17, Williams was old enough to become a volunteer and joined C Company of the IRA in the Clonard area where he lived. C Company's area of operations ran the extent of the lower Springfield Road, along the Falls Road from Beechmount to Conway Street, and surrounding the streets in between. Due to his \\"dedication and his remarkable ability\\" Williams was appointed to the role of Adjutant of C Company. At Easter 1942 the government of Northern Ireland had banned all parades to commemorate the anniversary of the Easter Rising. An IRA unit of six men and two women staged a diversionary action against the RUC to allow three parades to take place in West Belfast, but in this clash an RUC officer was killed and the six IRA men were captured. The RUC officer, Constable Patrick Murphy, a father of nine children, from the Falls Road, was one of a minority of Catholics serving in the RUC. There has been some debate over the years about who actually fired the fatal shot. The six IRA members were convicted and sentenced to death for murder under the law of common purpose. Five, Henry Cordner (19); William James Perry (21); Sean Terence Oliver (21); Patrick Simpson (18); and Joe Cahill (21) (who went on to become a senior figure in the IRA) had their sentences commuted. Williams, who acknowledged that he was the leader of the IRA unit involved, and took full responsibility for the actions of his men, did not. Execution Shirt worn by Williams in which he was arrested and executed which is now an exhibit at the Irish Republican History Museum in Belfast. Williams was hanged in Crumlin Road Gaol Belfast at 08:00 on Wednesday 2 September 1942. The executioner was the official English hangman Thomas Pierrepoint, assisted by his nephew Albert Pierrepoint. Afterwards Williams' body was interred in unhallowed ground in an unmarked grave within the grounds of the prison. His remains were only released in January 2000 after the closure of the prison in 1996 and a lengthy campaign by the National Graves Association, Belfast. Before Williams was executed he inscribed some messages on the backs of some playing cards. On one he wrote \\"To ever who receives this to pray for me always & pray for the cause for which I am dying. God Save Ireland‚Ä¶.\\" Father Alexis who witnessed the execution spoke after to his friends in the prison chapel. \\"I met the bravest of the brave this morning\\", he said, \\"Tom Williams walked to that scaffold without a tremor in his body. The only people who were shaking were us and the hangman\\". Father Alexis concluded by saying to the remaining prisoners, \\"I‚Äôve one other thing to say to you. Don‚Äôt pray for Tom Williams, pray to him, for at this moment Tom is a saint in heaven.\\" His funeral held on 19 January 2000 was attended by thousands, with Williams buried at Milltown Cemetery.Tom Williams comes home Joe Cahill, Tom's cell mate, and John Oliver, sentenced to death with Tom but later reprieved, as well as Madge McConville, who had been arrested with Tom, Greta McGlone, Billy McKee, Eddie Keenan and perhaps least known, Nell Morgan, Tom's girlfriend at the time of his death, were all present. Six senior Sinn F√©in members including Gerry Adams were also present in St Paul's Church on the Lower Falls Road for the Mass. Tom's boyhood friend and the man who introduced him to the Republican Movement, Alfie Hannaway, was unable to attend the funeral due to ill health. Tom's funeral Mass was celebrated by Rev Fr Paddy O'Donnell, C.Ss.R., a Redemptorist Priest from Clonard Monastery.

In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the village was mentioned as Cziernkow. The Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the War of the Austrian Succession most of Silesia was conquered by the Kingdom of Prussia, including the village.

S., & Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 780 Mondrian's art was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. He proclaimed in 1914: \\"Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. To approach the spiritual in art, one will make as little use as possible of reality, because reality is opposed to the spiritual. We find ourselves in the presence of an abstract art. Art should be above reality, otherwise it would have no value for man.\\"Seuphor, Michel (1956) Piet Mondrian: Life and Work. New York: Abrams: 117 His art, however, always remained rooted in nature. He was a contributor to the De Stijl art movement and group, which he co-founded with Theo van Doesburg. He evolved a non-representational form which he termed Neoplasticism. This was the new 'pure plastic art' which he believed was necessary in order to create 'universal beauty'. To express this, Mondrian eventually decided to limit his formal vocabulary to the three primary colors (red, blue and yellow), the three primary values (black, white and gray) and the two primary directions (horizontal and vertical).\\"Piet Mondrian\\", Tate gallery, published in Ronald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.532‚Äì3. Retrieved 18 December 2007. Mondrian's arrival in Paris from the Netherlands in 1911 marked the beginning of a period of profound change. He encountered experiments in Cubism and with the intent of integrating himself within the Parisian avant-garde removed an 'a' from the Dutch spelling of his name (Mondriaan). Mondrian's work had an enormous influence on 20th century art, influencing not only the course of abstract painting and numerous major styles and art movements (e.g. Color Field painting, Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism), but also fields outside the domain of painting, such as design, architecture and fashion.Darwent, Charles (2014) Complex Simplicity: The Enduring Influence of Mondrian. Design historian Stephen Bayley said: 'Mondrian has come to mean Modernism. His name and his work sum up the High Modernist ideal. I don't like the word ‚Äòiconic‚Äô, so let's say that he's become totemic ‚Äì a totem for everything Modernism set out to be.' Life =Netherlands (1872‚Äì1911)= Mondrian's birthplace in Amersfoort, Netherlands, now The Mondriaan House, a museum. Piet Mondrian lived in this house, now the Villa Mondriaan, in Winterswijk, from 1880 to 1892. Mondrian was born in Amersfoort, province of Utrecht in the Netherlands, the second of his parents' children.Deicher (1995), p. 93 He was descended from Christian Dirkzoon Monderyan who lived in The Hague as early as 1670.Michel Seuphor, Piet Mondrian: Life and Work (New York: Harry N. Abrams), pp. 44 and 407. The family moved to Winterswijk when his father, Pieter Cornelius Mondriaan, was appointed head teacher at a local primary school.Milner (1992), p. 9 Mondrian was introduced to art from an early age. His father was a qualified drawing teacher, and, with his uncle, Fritz Mondriaan (a pupil of Willem Maris of the Hague School of artists), the younger Piet often painted and drew along the river Gein.Milner (1995), pp. 9‚Äì10 After a strict Protestant upbringing, in 1892, Mondrian entered the Academy for Fine Art in Amsterdam.Deicher (1995), pp. 7‚Äì8 He was already qualified as a teacher. He began his career as a teacher in primary education, but he also practiced painting. Most of his work from this period is naturalistic or Impressionistic, consisting largely of landscapes. These pastoral images of his native country depict windmills, fields, and rivers, initially in the Dutch Impressionist manner of the Hague School and then in a variety of styles and techniques that attest to his search for a personal style. These paintings are representational, and they illustrate the influence that various artistic movements had on Mondrian, including pointillism and the vivid colors of Fauvism.

Another painting, Evening (Avond) (1908), depicting a tree in a field at dusk, even augurs future developments by using a palette consisting almost entirely of red, yellow, and blue. Although Avond is only limitedly abstract, it is the earliest Mondrian painting to emphasize primary colors. Piet Mondrian, View from the Dunes with Beach and Piers, Domburg, 1909, oil and pencil on cardboard, Museum of Modern Art, New York Mondrian's earliest paintings showing a degree of abstraction are a series of canvases from 1905 to 1908 that depict dim scenes of indistinct trees and houses reflected in still water. Although the result leads the viewer to begin focusing on the forms over the content, these paintings are still firmly rooted in nature, and it is only the knowledge of Mondrian's later achievements that leads one to search in these works for the roots of his future abstraction. Mondrian's art was intimately related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908, he became interested in the theosophical movement launched by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in the late 19th century, and in 1909 he joined the Dutch branch of the Theosophical Society. The work of Blavatsky and a parallel spiritual movement, Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy, significantly affected the further development of his aesthetic. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a more profound knowledge of nature than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge. In 1918, he wrote \\"I got everything from the Secret Doctrine\\", referring to a book written by Blavatsky. In 1921, in a letter to Steiner, Mondrian argued that his neoplasticism was \\"the art of the foreseeable future for all true Anthroposophists and Theosophists\\". He remained a committed Theosophist in subsequent years, although he also believed that his own artistic current, neoplasticism, would eventually become part of a larger, ecumenical spirituality. Mondrian and his later work were deeply influenced by the 1911 Moderne Kunstkring exhibition of Cubism in Amsterdam. His search for simplification is shown in two versions of Still Life with Ginger Pot (Stilleven met Gemberpot). The 1911 versionGuggenheim Collection ‚Äì Artist ‚Äì Mondrian ‚Äì Still Life with Gingerpot I is Cubist; in the 1912 versionGuggenheim Collection ‚Äì Artist ‚Äì Mondrian ‚Äì Still Life with Gingerpot II the objects are reduced to a round shape with triangles and rectangles. =Paris (1911‚Äì1914)= Gray Tree, 1911, Kunstmuseum Den Haag, an early experimentation with CubismGemeentemuseum Den Haag In 1911, Mondrian moved to Paris and changed his name, dropping an 'a' from Mondriaan, to emphasize his departure from the Netherlands, and his integration within the Parisian avant-garde.Mondriaan, Pieter Cornelis (1872‚Äì1944) at www.inghist.nl While in Paris, the influence of the Cubist style of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque appeared almost immediately in Mondrian's work. Paintings such as The Sea (1912) and his various studies of trees from that year still contain a measure of representation, but, increasingly, they are dominated by geometric shapes and interlocking planes. While Mondrian was eager to absorb the Cubist influence into his work, it seems clear that he saw Cubism as a \\"port of call\\" on his artistic journey, rather than as a destination. =Netherlands (1914‚Äì1919)= Unlike the Cubists, Mondrian still attempted to reconcile his painting with his spiritual pursuits, and in 1913 he began to fuse his art and his theosophical studies into a theory that signaled his final break from representational painting. While Mondrian was visiting the Netherlands in 1914, World War I began, forcing him to remain there for the duration of the conflict. During this period, he stayed at the Laren artists' colony, where he met Bart van der Leck and Theo van Doesburg, who were both undergoing their own personal journeys toward abstraction. Van der Leck's use of only primary colors in his art greatly influenced Mondrian. After a meeting with Van der Leck in 1916, Mondrian wrote, \\"My technique which was more or less Cubist, and therefore more or less pictorial, came under the influence of his precise method.\\" With Van Doesburg, Mondrian founded De Stijl (The Style), a journal of the De Stijl Group, in which he first published essays defining his theory, which he called neoplasticism. Mondrian published \\"De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst\\" (\\"The New Plastic in Painting\\")Mondrian 1986, 18‚Äì74. in twelve installments during 1917 and 1918. This was his first major attempt to express his artistic theory in writing. Mondrian's best and most-often quoted expression of this theory, however, comes from a letter he wrote to H. P. Bremmer in 1914: =Paris (1918‚Äì1938)= Tableau I, 1921, Kunstmuseum Den Haag Piet Mondrian and P√©tro (Nelly) van Doesburg in Mondrian's Paris studio, 1923 When World War I ended in 1918, Mondrian returned to France, where he would remain until 1938. Immersed in post-war Paris culture of artistic innovation, he flourished and fully embraced the art of pure abstraction for the rest of his life. Mondrian began producing grid-based paintings in late 1919, and in 1920, the style for which he came to be renowned began to appear. In the early paintings of this style, the lines delineating the rectangular forms are relatively thin, and they are gray, not black. The lines also tend to fade as they approach the edge of the painting, rather than stopping abruptly. The forms themselves, smaller and more numerous than in later paintings, are filled with primary colors, black, or gray, and nearly all of them are colored; only a few are left white. Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow, 1930, Kunsthaus Z√ºrich During late 1920 and 1921, Mondrian's paintings arrive at what is to casual observers their definitive and mature form. Thick black lines now separate the forms, which are larger and fewer in number, and more of the forms are left white. This was not the culmination of his artistic evolution, however. Although the refinements became subtler, Mondrian's work continued to evolve during his years in Paris. In the 1921 paintings, many, though not all, of the black lines stop short at a seemingly arbitrary distance from the edge of the canvas, although the divisions between the rectangular forms remain intact. Here, too, the rectangular forms remain mostly colored. As the years passed and Mondrian's work evolved further, he began extending all of the lines to the edges of the canvas, and he began to use fewer and fewer colored forms, favoring white instead. These tendencies are particularly obvious in the \\"lozenge\\" works that Mondrian began producing with regularity in the mid-1920s. The \\"lozenge\\" paintings are square canvases tilted 45 degrees, so that they have a diamond shape. Typical of these is Schilderij No. 1: Lozenge With Two Lines and Blue (1926). One of the most minimal of Mondrian's canvases, this painting consists only of two black, perpendicular lines and a small blue triangular form. The lines extend all the way to the edges of the canvas, almost giving the impression that the painting is a fragment of a larger work. Although one's view of the painting is hampered by the glass protecting it, and by the toll that age and handling have obviously taken on the canvas, a close examination of this painting begins to reveal something of the artist's method. The painting is not composed of perfectly flat planes of color, as one might expect. Subtle brush strokes are evident throughout. The artist appears to have used different techniques for the various elements. The black lines are the flattest elements, with the least amount of depth. The colored forms have the most obvious brush strokes, all running in one direction. Most interesting, however, are the white forms, which clearly have been painted in layers, using brush strokes running in different directions. This generates a greater sense of depth in the white forms so that they appear to overwhelm the lines and the colors, which indeed they were doing, as Mondrian's paintings of this period came to be increasingly dominated by white space. In 1926, Katherine Dreier, co-founder of New York City's Society of Independent Artists (along with Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray), visited Piet Mondrian's studio in Paris and acquired one of his diamond compositions, Painting I. This was then shown during an exhibition organized by the Society of Independent Artists in the Brooklyn Museum--the first major exhibition of modern art in America since the Armory Show. She stated in the catalog that \\"Holland has produced three great painters who, though a logical expression of their own country, rose above it through the vigor of their personality ‚Äì the first was Rembrandt, the second was Van Gogh, and the third is Mondrian.\\" As the years progressed, lines began to take precedence over forms in Mondrian's paintings. In the 1930s, he began to use thinner lines and double lines more frequently, punctuated with a few small colored forms, if any at all. Double lines particularly excited Mondrian, for he believed they offered his paintings a new dynamism which he was eager to explore. The introduction of the double line in his work was influenced by the work of his friend and contemporary Marlow Moss. From 1934 to 1935, three of Mondrian's paintings were exhibited as part of the \\"Abstract and Concrete\\" exhibitions in the UK at Oxford, London, and Liverpool. =London and New York (1938‚Äì1944)= Composition No. 10 (1939‚Äì1942), oil on canvas, private collection. Fellow De Stijl artist Theo van Doesburg suggested a link between non-representational works of art and ideals of peace and spirituality.Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond; Christina Lodder, Maria Kokkori, Maria Mileeva; BRILL, Oct 24, 2013 In September 1938, Mondrian left Paris in the face of advancing fascism and moved to London.Casiraghi, Roberto \\"Piet Mondrian ‚Äì Nike Dunk Low SB ‚Äì Available!\\" After the Netherlands was invaded and Paris fell in 1940, he left London for Manhattan in New York City, where he would remain until his death. Some of Mondrian's later works are difficult to place in terms of his artistic development because there were quite a few canvases that he began in Paris or London and only completed months or years later in Manhattan. The finished works from this later period are visually busy, with more lines than any of his work since the 1920s, placed in an overlapping arrangement that is almost cartographical in appearance. He spent many long hours painting on his own until his hands blistered, and he sometimes cried or made himself sick. Mondrian produced Lozenge Composition With Four Yellow Lines (1933), a simple painting that innovated thick, colored lines instead of black ones. After that one painting, this practice remained dormant in Mondrian's work until he arrived in Manhattan, at which time he began to embrace it with abandon. In some examples of this new direction, such as Composition (1938) / Place de la Concorde (1943), he appears to have taken unfinished black-line paintings from Paris and completed them in New York by adding short perpendicular lines of different colors, running between the longer black lines, or from a black line to the edge of the canvas. The newly colored areas are thick, almost bridging the gap between lines and forms, and it is startling to see color in a Mondrian painting that is unbounded by black. Other works mix long lines of red amidst the familiar black lines, creating a new sense of depth by the addition of a colored layer on top of the black one. His painting Composition No. 10, 1939‚Äì1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined Mondrian's radical but classical approach to the rectangle. On 23 September 1940 Mondrian left Europe for New York aboard the Cunard White Star Lines ship RMS Samaria, departing from Liverpool. The new canvases that Mondrian began in Manhattan are even more startling, and indicate the beginning of a new idiom that was cut short by the artist's death. New York City (1942) is a complex lattice of red, blue, and yellow lines, occasionally interlacing to create a greater sense of depth than his previous works. An unfinished 1941 version of this work uses strips of painted paper tape, which the artist could rearrange at will to experiment with different designs. Victory Boogie Woogie (1942‚Äì1944), Kunstmuseum Den Haag His painting Broadway Boogie-Woogie (1942‚Äì43) at The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan was highly influential in the school of abstract geometric painting. The piece is made up of a number of shimmering squares of bright color that leap from the canvas, then appear to shimmer, drawing the viewer into those neon lights. In this painting and the unfinished Victory Boogie Woogie (1942‚Äì1944), Mondrian replaced former solid lines with lines created from small adjoining rectangles of color, created in part by using small pieces of paper tape in various colors. Larger unbounded rectangles of color punctuate the design, some with smaller concentric rectangles inside them. While Mondrian's works of the 1920s and 1930s tend to have an almost scientific austerity about them, these are bright, lively paintings, reflecting the upbeat music that inspired them and the city in which they were made. In these final works, the forms have indeed usurped the role of the lines, opening another new door for Mondrian's development as an abstractionist. The Boogie- Woogie paintings were clearly more of a revolutionary change than an evolutionary one, representing the most profound development in Mondrian's work since his abandonment of representational art in 1913. In 2008 the Dutch television program Andere Tijden found the only known movie footage with Mondrian. \\"Eerste filmbeelden Mondriaan\\" (NOS Journaal, 28-08-2008, visited: idem) The discovery of the film footage was announced at the end of a two-year research program on the Victory Boogie Woogie. The research found that the painting was in very good condition and that Mondrian painted the composition in one session. It also was found that the composition was changed radically by Mondrian shortly before his death by using small pieces of colored tape. =Wall works= When the 47-year-old Piet Mondrian left the Netherlands for unfettered Paris for the second and last time in 1919, he set about at once to make his studio a nurturing environment for paintings he had in mind that would increasingly express the principles of neoplasticism about which he had been writing for two years. To hide the studio's structural flaws quickly and inexpensively, he tacked up large rectangular placards, each in a single color or neutral hue. Smaller colored paper squares and rectangles, composed together, accented the walls. Then came an intense period of painting. Again he addressed the walls, repositioning the colored cutouts, adding to their number, altering the dynamics of color and space, producing new tensions and equilibrium. Before long, he had established a creative schedule in which a period of painting took turns with a period of experimentally regrouping the smaller papers on the walls, a process that directly fed the next period of painting. It was a pattern he followed for the rest of his life, through wartime moves from Paris to London's Hampstead in 1938 and 1940, across the Atlantic to Manhattan. At the age of 71 in the fall of 1943, Mondrian moved into his second and final Manhattan studio at 15 East 59th Street, and set about to recreate the environment he had learned over the years was most congenial to his modest way of life and most stimulating to his art. He painted the high walls the same off-white he used on his easel and on the seats, tables and storage cases he designed and fashioned meticulously from discarded orange and apple-crates. He glossed the top of a white metal stool in the same brilliant primary red he applied to the cardboard sheath he made for the radio-phonograph that spilled forth his beloved jazz from well- traveled records. Visitors to this last studio seldom saw more than one or two new canvases, but found, often to their astonishment, that eight large compositions of colored bits of paper he had tacked and re-tacked to the walls in ever-changing relationships constituted together an environment that, paradoxically and simultaneously, was both kinetic and serene, stimulating and restful. It was the best space, Mondrian said, that he had inhabited. He was there for only a few months, as he died in February 1944. After his death, Mondrian's friend and sponsor in Manhattan, artist Harry Holtzman, and another painter friend, Fritz Glarner, carefully documented the studio on film and in still photographs before opening it to the public for a six-week exhibition. Before dismantling the studio, Holtzman (who was also Mondrian's heir) traced the wall compositions precisely, prepared exact portable facsimiles of the space each had occupied, and affixed to each the original surviving cut-out components. These portable Mondrian compositions have become known as \\"The Wall Works\\". Since Mondrian's death, they have been exhibited twice at Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art (1983 and 1995‚Äì96),Museum of Modern Art, New York, Press release, August 1995 once in SoHo at the Carpenter + Hochman Gallery (1984), once each at the Galerie Tokoro in Tokyo, Japan (1993), the XXII Biennial of Sao Paulo (1994), the University of Michigan (1995), and ‚Äì the first time shown in Europe ‚Äì at the Akademie der K√ºnste (Academy of The Arts), in Berlin (22 February ‚Äì 22 April 2007). Death Piet Mondrian died of pneumonia on 1 February 1944 and was interred at the Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. On 3 February 1944 a memorial was held for Mondrian at the Universal Chapel on Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street in Manhattan. The service was attended by nearly 200 people including Alexander Archipenko, Marc Chagall, Marcel Duchamp, Fernand L√©ger, Alexander Calder and Robert Motherwell.

Originally conceived by Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart, a history professor at Harvard University, a personal friend of Roosevelt and member of the Roosevelt Memorial Association, now known as the Theodore Roosevelt Association, Hart's goal was, in his words, to \\"present in alphabetical arrangement, extracts sufficiently numerous and comprehensive to display all the phases of (Theodore) Roosevelt's activities and opinions as expressed by him.\\" A primitive on-line version of the original work is also maintained by the TRA.The Theodore Roosevelt Centennial CD-ROM Online but quite primitive version of the Cyclopedia at the Theodore Roosevelt Association web site with no look-up features History of the project Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th U.S. president, popularly known as \\"TR\\" and \\"Teddy\\" (although Roosevelt despised that name), died on January 6, 1919. Within a few days, the Roosevelt Memorial Association was founded by Roosevelt's friends and associates. The Association was formally chartered by special Act of Congress, May 31, 1920, Led in the years 1919‚Äì1957 by Secretary and Director Hermann Hagedorn (1882‚Äì1964), poet, author, historian, friend and biographer of Roosevelt, the Association engaged in a wide spectrum of programs and activities to preserve his memory. In the Association's Annual Report 1924, Hagedorn announced that \\"a Roosevelt Cyclopedia or Roosevelt Thesaurus\\" was being edited by Professor Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard University. Albert Bushnell Hart (1854‚Äì1943) was a classmate of Roosevelt's at Harvard, Class of 1880, and like Roosevelt, a Phi Beta Kappa. Hart received a Ph.D. degree at the University of Freiburg in Germany in 1883, and that same year joined the faculty of Harvard. He taught at Harvard 1883‚Äì1926. One of the first generation of professionally trained historians in the United States, a prolific author and editor of historical works, Albert Bushnell Hart became, as Samuel Eliot Morison says, \\"The Grand Old Man\\" of American history, looking the part with his \\"patriarchal full beard and flowing moustaches.\\" Hart was a devoted friend and follower of Theodore Roosevelt, and was elected as a Roosevelt delegate to the Republican convention of 1912. He became an enthusiastic trustee and supporter of the Roosevelt Memorial Association, and said that from the time of Roosevelt's death he had the idea of editing a Roosevelt-centered cyclopedia. The projected reference work would, Hart explained, \\"present in alphabetical arrangement extracts sufficiently numerous and comprehensive to display all the phases of Roosevelt's activities and opinions as expressed by him.\\" He wrote Hagedorn: \\"What we are after is the crisp, sharp, biting sparks that flew from the Roosevelt brain.\\" Hart told the survivors of the Harvard Class of 1880 that editing the cyclopedia \\"will be a very interesting and agreeable service to the memory of our great classmate.\\" Initial problems and new leadership But from the beginning the project was plagued with problems. Hart's time was taken up with other commitments. He was editor of the American Year Book, 1926‚Äì1932, edited a five-volume history of Massachusetts in 1927‚Äì1930, and worked as the official historian of the George Washington bicentennial commission in the 1920s and 1930s. Hart had to postpone the cyclopedia, and asked the Association for research and clerical staff. But the Executive Committee of the Roosevelt Memorial Association delayed appropriations for the cyclopedia, because the expense was \\"so great,\\" and it was not until May 1928 that a budget was approved for the cyclopedia, although the project had been publicly announced years before. Finally, in 1931 Hart presented a rough draft of the cyclopedia to Hagedorn. But the book needed much more work. By now the elderly Hart \\"began to decline,\\" wrote Samuel Eliot Morison; and Hagedorn reported to the RMA Executive Committee that Hart could not finish the project \\"because of his advanced years.\\" In 1939, Hagedorn assigned the cyclopedia to Herbert Ronald Ferleger (1914‚Äì1973), a graduate student and professional researcher who had done work for the Association. Ferleger, who graduated from Temple University in 1934, had been a Research Fellow at the Brookings Institution, and had taught at Princeton. He received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University in 1942. Ferleger completed his work in 1940. William Allen White (1868‚Äì1944), the editor of the Emporia Gazette, Emporia, Kansas, a respected and beloved public figure, a trustee of the Association who had been a close friend of TR's, wrote a foreword for the book. Roosevelt Cyclopedia completed On January 6, 1941, the Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia was published by the Association. The total costs to the RMA from 1928 to 1941 in salaries, printing, and other expenses came to $22,509.52. In the final analysis, The Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia represented the vision and plan of Albert Bushnell Hart, the dedication and patience of Hermann Hagedorn, and the research and hard work of Herbert Ronald Ferleger. Lawrence F. Abbott, who worked with TR when the former President was Contributing Editor of the Outlook magazine, once roughly estimated that Roosevelt published perhaps 2,500,000 words, and wrote a total of maybe 18,000,000 words when his letters are included in the count. Certainly, TR left a prodigious legacy of words in addition to his other achievements. About 550,000 of those words are in the Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia. The final work The Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia, published in 1941, consists of 674 pages with well over 4,000 quotations arranged alphabetically by topic or subject, from \\"Abbey Theatre\\" to \\"Youth.\\" Thousands of topics and subjects are listed, counting the extensive cross-reference entries. The original source of each quotation is given, and if the passage appears in the Charles Scribner's Sons editions of the Works of Theodore Roosevelt (1923‚Äì1926), volume and page numbers are listed for the National (20 volumes) and/or Memorial (24 volumes) editions. A guide or chart for the Scribner's Memorial and National editions is provided in the \\"Editors' Note\\" at the beginning of the Cyclopedia, listing the basic contents of each volume. Most of the quotations are taken from the Scribner's editions of the Works of Theodore Roosevelt, but approximately 380 quotations in the Cyclopedia, not counting excerpts from letters, are from articles, speeches, and other sources not included in the Scribner's editions. Additionally, over forty recorded conversations are quoted, most of these not in the Scribner's editions. The editors of the Cyclopedia, Albert Bushnell Hart and Herbert Ronald Ferleger, unfortunately, did not make use of the unpublished letters in the Theodore Roosevelt Papers at the Library of Congress or of other collections of unpublished papers. And the eight-volume Letters of Theodore Roosevelt, based on the Theodore Roosevelt Papers at the Library of Congress and other collections, came out in the 1950s, and therefore was not available to the editors. Only one unpublished letter is quoted in the Cyclopedia: TR to the Rev. William W. Moir, October 10, 1898, pp. 534‚Äì535, explaining how to pronounce the name Roosevelt. Fortunately, however, many published TR letters were available to the editors in the 1920s and 1930s, most notably in Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children (1919), covering the years 1898-1911, edited by Joseph Bucklin Bishop, included in both Scribner's National and Memorial editions; Letters from Theodore Roosevelt to Anna Roosevelt Cowles, 1870-1918 (1924); Selections from the Correspondence of Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, 1884-1918 (1925), two volumes; My Brother Theodore Roosevelt (1921) by Corinne Roosevelt Robinson; and Theodore Roosevelt and His Time, Shown in His Letters (1920), two volumes, by Joseph Bucklin Bishop, included in the Memorial edition. Bishop, whose biography had been authorized by TR before the former President's death, had complete access to what became the collection of Theodore Roosevelt Papers at the Library of Congress. Over 670 quotations in the Cyclopedia are from letters by Roosevelt. Topics in the Cyclopedia The topics and subjects included in the Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia cover the full range of TR's activities and opinions. Issues of TR's times, like \\"Silver Issue,\\" \\"Recall of Judicial Decisions,\\" and \\"Trust Legislation,\\" and periods and events in Roosevelt's career, such as \\"New York Assembly-Roosevelt's Service in,\\" \\"Governor of New York,\\" and \\"Roosevelt's Reception in Europe\\" (1910), are listed in the Cyclopedia. Roosevelt's views on the historical events of his era, such as \\"Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War,\\" \\"Russo-Japanese War,\\" \\"Panic of 1907\\" and \\"Election of 1916,\\" are given. Some 149 people are listed as subjects in the Cyclopedia, from historical figures before TR's times, like Oliver Cromwell, Frederick the Great, and John Marshall, to Roosevelts's contemporaries, including Jane Addams, William Jennings Bryan, Mark Hanna, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Pancho Villa, Woodrow Wilson and Booker T. Washington. Roosevelt's comments on writers are given, from Dante to Dickens to Edwin Arlington Robinson. Institutions, groups, and organizations, such as the Methodist Church, Mugwumps, Y.M.C.A., U.S. Senate, Audubon Societies, and Progressive Party, are listed. Birds and animals‚Äîousel, wapiti, elephant, mocking-bird, moose, and many others‚Äîare described in the words of the hunter- naturalist TR. Historical topics from before Roosevelt's era are covered, including the fall of the Roman Empire, the Mongol Invasions, the French Revolution, and the War of 1812. Many of the entries in the Cyclopedia are general topics, like \\"citizenship,\\" \\"experts in government,\\" \\"ideals,\\" \\"reading,\\" \\"tolerance,\\" \\"women in politics,\\" and \\"scholarship.\\" Other entries are specific references, such as \\"Socialism in Sweden,\\" \\"Standard Oil Company, \\"Bryce's American Commonwealth,\\" and \\"Northern Securities Case.\\" Theodore Roosevelt was a great phrase-maker and coiner of terms, and most of his famous slogans, epithets, titles, sayings, and characterizations are listed in the Cyclopedia, including \\"lunatic fringe,\\" \\"Square Deal,\\" \\"malefactors of great wealth,\\" \\"Big Stick,\\" \\"muck-rakers,\\" \\"Bull Moose,\\" \\"nature fakers,\\" \\"polyglot boarding house,\\" \\"weasel words,\\" \\"New Nationalism,\\" \\"broomstick preparedness,\\" and \\"strenuous life.\\" A few others, however, are not in the Cyclopedia, such as \\"Ananias Club\\" (liars) and \\"bully pulpit\\" (the White House). Unfortunately, the editors made no systematic attempt to trace or indicate the origin and first use of a term or phrase. The earliest use is often given, but not in all cases. This failure to include notes on the history of phrases and terms is a real limitation in the Cyclopedia as a reference work. The editors were clearly more interested in presenting Roosevelt's thought than in producing a guide to familiar quotations, though most of the famous quotations were included in the book. The quotations given are often lengthy, thereby preserving much of the original context, and providing an accurate view of Roosevelt's thinking. Usually quotations on a topic are taken from a variety of sources over a period of many years, thus showing the development and the remarkable degree of continuity in TR's thought. In some cases, the quotations selected do not give the full scope of Roosevelt's opinions on a particular subject. For instance, only favorable remarks are quoted for William McKinley and M. La Follette Sr., whereas TR was also critical of both leaders, particularly Senator La Follette. But on most subjects an accurate, balanced, and full picture of TR's thinking is given. For instance, the quotations on William Howard Taft show TR's changing views of a man who was at one time a close friend and associate and later a political opponent. Likewise, the coverage of the Panama Canal is thorough. Many of the remarks quoted are candid and colorful, and the private as well as the public Roosevelt is revealed in the Cyclopedia. Anyone familiar with TR's words will probably regret that some particular quotations were not included in the Cyclopedia. But on the whole, the editors did an excellent job in selecting quotations that show the totality of the many-sided Roosevelt. Strengths and weaknesses The chief weaknesses of the Cyclopedia are, as noted, that the editors did not use the then unpublished letters by TR, and did not trace the roots or indicate the first uses of famous phrases and key concepts. The strengths of the Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia are many. The choice of topics and subjects is almost exhaustive of the possibilities. The book is thoroughly cross-referenced. The editors used a wide variety of sources, from speeches and state papers to recorded conversations and letters to family members, from little-known articles to Roosevelt's numerous books. The quotations given are for the most part well-chosen, and care was taken to present views on a particular topic expressed over a wide span of time, and to give a full and accurate summary of Roosevelt's thought. No attempt was made to tailor Roosevelt's views to fit the ideological fashions of later periods. Roosevelt \\"in his miraculous abundance,\\" as William Allen White said, is found in the Cyclopedia. The editors indeed accomplished their stated purpose: to present in one volume \\"the essence of Theodore Roosevelt-the ideals, principles, and convictions for which he lived; the thoughts, views, and opinions he expressed on a multitude of issues.\\" The Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia is a valuable scholarly work that will remain of use as long as anyone is interested in him. The Cyclopedia is now available in CD format and there is a primitive online version of the work at the Theodore Roosevelt Association's web site. There is ongoing discussion on updating that Web publication into a full-featured web- enabled system.

Weinberg is the William Rand Kenan, Jr. Professor Emeritus of History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He has been a member of the history faculty at UNC-Chapel Hill since 1974. Previously he served on the faculties of the University of Michigan (1959‚Äì1974) and the University of Kentucky (1957‚Äì1959). Youth and education Weinberg was born in Hanover, Germany, and resided there the first ten years of his life. As Jews living in Nazi Germany, he and his family suffered increasing persecution. They emigrated in 1938, first to the United Kingdom and then in 1941 to New York State. Weinberg became a U.S. citizen, served in the U.S. Army during its Occupation of Japan in 1946-1947, and returned to receive a BA in social studies from the State University of New York at Albany. He received his MA (1949) and PhD (1951) in history from the University of Chicago. Weinberg recounted some of his childhood memories and experiences in a two- hour long oral history interview for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.Oral History Interview with Gerhard L. Weinberg, condcuted by Astrid M. Eckert (Emory University) on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, March 2012. Available at http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn74729 Early career Weinberg has studied the foreign policy of National Socialist Germany and the Second World War for his entire professional life. His doctoral dissertation (1951), directed by Hans Rothfels, was \\"German Relations with Russia, 1939‚Äì1941,\\" subsequently published in 1954 as Germany and the Soviet Union, 1939‚Äì1941. From 1951 to 1954 Weinberg was a Research Analyst for the War Documentation Project at Columbia University and was Director of the American Historical Association Project for Microfilming Captured German Documents in 1956‚Äì1957. After joining the project to microfilm captured records at Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1950s, Weinberg published the Guide to Captured German Documents (1952).On the history of the captured German archives and Weinberg's role, see Astrid M. Eckert, The Struggle for the Files: The Western Allies and the Return of German archives after the Second World War. Cambridge University Press, 2012. , pp. 343‚Äì357. In 1958, Weinberg made the discovery of Hitler's so-called Zweites Buch (Second Book), an unpublished sequel to Mein Kampf, among captured German files. His find led to his publication in 1961 of Hitlers zweites Buch: Ein Dokument aus dem Jahr 1928, later published in English as Hitler's Second Book: The Unpublished Sequel to Mein Kampf (2003). In 1953‚Äì1954, Weinberg was involved in a scholarly debate with and Andreas Hillgruber on the pages of the Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte journal over the question of whether Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was a preventive war forced on Hitler by fears of an imminent Soviet attack. In a 1956 review of Hillgruber's book Hitler, K√∂nig Carol und Marschall Antonescu, Weinberg accused Hillgruber of engaging at times in a pro-German apologia such as asserting that World War II began with the Anglo‚ÄìFrench declarations of war against Germany on September 3, 1939, rather than the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939.Weinberg, Gerhard. Review of Hitler, K√∂nig Carol und Marschall Antonescu: die deutsch- rum√§nischen Beziehungen, 1938‚Äì1944 by Andreas Hillgruber, pages 80‚Äì82 in The Journal of Modern History, Volume 28, Issue # 1, March 1956 page 81 In his 1980 monograph The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937‚Äì1939, Weinberg noted that about the question of the war's origins that \\"my view is somewhat different\\" from Hillgruber's.Weinberg, Gerhard. 'The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937‚Äì1939, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 657. In his 1981 book World in the Balance, Weinberg stated that \\"Hillgruber's interpretation is not, however, followed here\\".Weinberg, Gerhard. World in the Balance. Hanover: Brandeis University Press 1981, page 82. In his 1994 book A World At Arms, Weinberg called Hillgruber's thesis presented in his book Zweierlei Untergang ‚Äì Die Zerschlagung des Deutschen Reiches und das Ende des europ√§ischen Judentums (Two Kinds of Ruin ‚Äì The Smashing of the German Reich and the End of European Jewry) \\"... a preposterous reversal of the realities\\".Weinberg, Gerhard. A World At Arms. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1994, 2005, page 1124. Weinberg sarcastically commented that if the German Army had held out longer against the Red Army in 1945 as Hillgruber had wished, the result would not have been the saving of more German lives as Hillgruber had claimed, but rather an American atomic bombing of Germany. Another scholarly debate involving Weinberg occurred in 1962‚Äì1963 when Weinberg wrote a review of David Hoggan's 1961 book Der Erzwungene Krieg for the American Historical Review. The book claimed that the outbreak of war in 1939 had been due to an Anglo‚ÄìPolish conspiracy against Germany. In his review, Weinberg suggested that Hoggan had probably engaged in forging documents (the charge was later confirmed). Weinberg noted that Hoggan's method comprised taking of all Hitler's \\"peace speeches\\" at face value, and simply ignoring evidence of German intentions for aggression such as the Hossbach Memorandum.Weinberg, Gerhard. Review of Der Erzwungene Krieg, from The American Historical Review, Volume 68, No. 1, October 1962, page 104 Moreover, Weinberg noted that Hoggan often rearranged events in a chronology designed to support his thesis such as placing the Polish rejection of the German demand for the return of the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) to the Reich in October 1938 instead of in August 1939, thereby giving a false impression that the Polish refusal to consider changing the status of Danzig was due to British pressure. Weinberg noted that Hoggan had appeared to engage in forgery by manufacturing documents and attributing statements that were not found in documents in the archives.Weinberg, Gerhard. Review of Der Erzwungene Krieg, from The American Historical Review, Volume 68, No. 1, October 1962, pages 104‚Äì105 As an example, Weinberg noted during a meeting between Neville Chamberlain and Adam von Trott zu Solz in June 1939, Hoggan had Chamberlain saying that the British guarantee of Polish independence given on March 31, 1939 \\"did not please him personally at all. He thereby gave the impression that Halifax was solely responsible for British policy\\".Weinberg, Gerhard. Review of Der Erzwungene Krieg, from The American Historical Review, Volume 68, No. 1, October 1962, page 105 As Weinberg noted, what Chamberlain actually said was: > Do you [Trott zu Solz] believe that I undertook these commitments gladly? > Hitler forced me into them! Subsequently, both Hoggan and his mentor Harry Elmer Barnes wrote a series of letters to the American Historical Review protesting Weinberg's review and attempting to rebut his arguments. Weinberg in turn published letters rebutting Barnes's and Hoggan's claims. Major works Weinberg's early work was the two-volume history of Hitler's diplomatic preparations for war: The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany (1970 and 1980; republished 1994). In this work, Weinberg portrayed a Hitler committed to his ideology, no matter how inane or stupid it might seem to others, and therefore as a leader determined to use foreign policy to effect a specific set of goals. Weinberg thus countered others, such as British historian A.J.P. Taylor, who had argued in The Origins of the Second World War (1962) that Hitler had acted like a traditional statesman in taking advantage of the weaknesses of foreign rivals. The first volume of The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany received the George Louis Beer Prize of the American Historical Association in 1971. Weinberg's attention then turned to the Second World War. He published dozens of articles on the war and volumes of collected essays such as World in the Balance: Behind the Scenes of World War II (1981). All of that work was preparation for the release in 1994 of his 1000-page one-volume history of the war, A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II, for which he won a second George Louis Beer Prize in 1994. Weinberg continued his studies of the era of the war even after the publication of his general history by examining the conceptions of World War II's leaders about the world that they thought they were fighting to create. It was published in 2005 as Visions of Victory: The Hopes of Eight World War II Leaders. In that book, Weinberg looked at what eight leaders were hoping to see after the war ended. The eight leaders profiled were Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, General Hideki T≈çj≈ç, Chiang Kai-shek, Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, General Charles de Gaulle, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Weinberg has continued to be a critic of those who claim that Operation Barbarossa was a \\"preventive war\\" forced on Hitler. In a review of Stalin's War by , Weinberg called those who promote the preventive war thesis as believers in \\"fairy tales\\".Weinberg, Gerhard. Review of Stalin's War: A Radical New Theory of the Origins of the Second World War by Ernst Topitsch, pages 800‚Äì801 from The American Historical Review, Volume 94, Issue # 3, June 1989 page 800. In 1996, Weinberg was somewhat less harsh in his review of Topitsch's book but was still very critical in his assessment of the Czech historian R.C. Raack's Stalin's Drive to the West. (The latter book did not accept the preventive war thesis, but Raack still argued that Soviet foreign policy was far more aggressive than many other historians would accept and that Western leaders were too pliant in their dealings with Stalin.)Weinberg, Gerhard. Review of Stalin's Drive to the West: The Origins of the Cold War by R.C. Raack, pages 278‚Äì279 from Central European History, Volume 29, Issue #2, 1996. In the globalist versus continentalist debate, concerning whether Hitler had ambitions to conquer the entire world or merely the continent of Europe, Weinberg takes a globalist view, arguing Hitler had plans for world conquest. On the question of whether Hitler intended to murder Europe's Jews before coming to power, Weinberg takes an intentionalist position, arguing that Hitler had formulated ideas for the Holocaust by the time he wrote Mein Kampf. In a 1994 article, Weinberg criticized the American functionalist historian Christopher Browning for arguing that the decision to launch the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" was taken in September‚ÄìOctober 1941.Weinberg, Gerhard. \\"Comments on the Papers by Friedlander, Breitman, and Browning\\", pages 509‚Äì512 from German Studies Review, Volume 17, Issue # 3, October 1994, page 511. In Weinberg's view, July 1941 was the more probable date. In the same article, Weinberg praised the work of the American historian Henry Friedlander for arguing that the origins of the Holocaust can be traced to the Action T4 program, which began in January 1939.Weinberg, Gerhard. \\"Comments on the Papers by Friedlander, Breitman, and Browning\\", pages 509‚Äì512 from German Studies Review, Volume 17, Issue # 3, October 1994, page 509. Finally, Weinberg praised the thesis put forward by the American historian Richard Breitman that planning for the Shoah began during the winter of 1940‚Äì1941 but argued that Breitman missed what Weinberg argued was a crucial point: because the T4 program had generated public protests, the Einsatzgruppen massacres of Jews in the Soviet Union were intended as a sort of \\"trial run\\" to gauge reaction of the German people to genocide.Weinberg, Gerhard. \\"Comments on the Papers by Friedlander, Breitman, and Browning\\", pages 509‚Äì512 from German Studies Review, Volume 17, Issue # 3, October 1994, page 510. A major theme of Weinberg's work about the origins of the Second World War has been a revised picture of Neville Chamberlain and the Munich Agreement. Based on his study of German documents, Weinberg established that the demands made by Hitler on the cession of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia were not intended to be accepted but were rather to provide a pretext for aggression against Czechoslovakia.Weinberg, Gerhard. \\"Reflections on Munich After Sixty Years\\", pages 1‚Äì12 from The Munich Crisis, 1938, edited by Igor Lukes and Erik Goldstein, Frank Cass: London 1999, pages 3‚Äì5 Weinberg has established that Hitler regarded the Munich Agreement as a diplomatic defeat, which deprived Germany of the war that was intended to begin on October 1, 1938. Weinberg has argued against the thesis that Chamberlain was responsible for the failure of the proposed putsch in Germany in 1938.Weinberg, Gerhard. The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II. University of Chicago Press: Chicago, Illinois, United States of America, 1980. page 396 Weinberg has argued that the three visits to London in the summer of 1938 of three messengers from the opposition, each bearing the same message (if only Britain would promise to go to war if Czechoslovakia was attacked, then a putsch would remove the Nazi regime, each ignorant of the other messengers' existence), presented a picture of a group of people apparently not very well organized and that it is unreasonable for historians to have expected Chamberlain to stake all upon uncorroborated words of such a badly-organized group. In a 2007 review of Ian Kershaw's Fateful Choices, Weinberg, though generally favorable to Kershaw, commented that Chamberlain played a far more important role in the decision to fight on despite the great German victories in the spring of 1940 and in ensuring that Churchill was his successor, instead of the peace-minded Lord Halifax, than Kershaw gave him credit for in his book. Weinberg's picture of Chamberlain has led to criticism; the American historian Williamson Murray condemned Weinberg for his \\"... attempts to present the British Prime Minister in as favorable a light as possible\\".Murray, Williamson. The Change in the European Balance In Power, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984, page 471 Hitler diaries controversy In 1983, when the German illustrated weekly magazine Der Stern reported its purchase of the alleged diaries of Adolf Hitler, the U.S. weekly magazine Newsweek asked Weinberg to examine them hurriedly in a bank vault in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Together with Hugh Trevor- Roper and Eberhard J√§ckel, Weinberg was one of the three experts on Hitler asked to examine the alleged diaries. Squeezing the visit into just a few hours so as not to miss any of his teaching assignments at Chapel Hill, Weinberg reported in Newsweek that \\"on balance I am inclined to consider the material authentic.\\"Newsweek, May 7, 1983; Robert Harris, Selling Hitler: The Extraordinary Story of the Con Job of the Century -- The Faking of the Hitler \\"Diaries\\" (New York: Pantheon, 1986), 272. Weinberg also noted that the purported journals would likely add less to our understanding of the Second World War than many might have thought and that more work would be needed to \\"make the verdict [of authenticity] airtight.\\"Newsweek, May 7, 1983. When that work was undertaken by the German Federal Archives, the \\"diaries\\" were deemed forgeries. Professional accomplishments Weinberg was elected president of the German Studies Association in 1996. Weinberg has been a fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies, a Fulbright professor at the University of Bonn, a Guggenheim Fellow, and a Shapiro Senior Scholar in Residence at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum among many other such honors. In June 2009, Weinberg was selected to receive the $100,000 Pritzker Military Library Literature Award for lifetime excellence in military writing, sponsored by the Chicago-based Tawani Foundation.2009 award , official website. As part of his acceptance, he gave a webcast lecture at the library on \\"New Boundaries for the World: The Postwar Visions of Eight World War II Leaders.\\"Webcast Lecture at the Pritzker Military Library on March 11, 2010 He was awarded the 2011 Samuel Eliot Morison Prize, a lifetime achievement award given by the Society for Military History.

The band's sound combines vocals, cello, massed guitars, pianos, melodicas, sequencers, synthesizers, samplers, tape, percussion, and other instruments. Mahogany also use film, video, animation, cinema, graphic design, photography, typography and other realization and rendering techniques for a cumulative effect that the band refers to as the \\"Hypercube\\". Mahogany have released two critically acclaimed full-length albums, The Dream of the Modern Day (2000) and Connectivity! (2006), as well as numerous singles, EPs and compilation tracks collected on Memory Column: Early Works and Rarities 1996-2004 (2005). They have performed live with Vampire Weekend, Spoon, Chairlift, Clinic, Bloc Party, Serena Maneesh, Interpol, Luna, Broadcast, Resplandor, and others, maintaining a cult status among the group‚Äôs listeners. Foundation Mahogany are the brainchild of Andrew Prinz, created as a response borne of multidisciplinary generational precedent initiated by Prinz's great-grandfather Harry S. Will, a violinist, artist, designer and founder of the Columbus Orchestral Society (who Prinz cites as establishing Mahogany's organizational tabula rasa), and his grandfather Vernon A. Will, a mathematician and guitarist (who, according to Prinz, provided the ensemble's theoretical, aesthetic and ethical basis via his 1961 doctoral thesis The Order of Freedom: An Inquiry into the Theory of Human Selection). According to Prinz, the band's name references the Kurt Weill/Bertolt Brecht opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, as well as the mahogany tree's role as a \\"precious and beautiful living resource, essential to the Earth's biosphere...and a superior material for the construction of both interiors and musical instruments, prized for its beauty and naturally harmonious resonant characteristics.\\" The group was founded by Prinz and cellist/vocalist Allysa Massais in 1995 while Prinz attended Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, initially studying music theory and composition, then photography, art history, studio art, and graphic design. With concentrations in cello under Owen Carman and bass with Peter Dominguez, Prinz had already performed with and attended workshops and master classes led by jazz greats like Maynard Ferguson, John Faddis and Dizzy Gillespie before forming the first iteration of Mahogany. Prior to Mahogany, Prinz collaborated with mentor Scott Cortez in two of the latter's musical projects, Lovesliescrushing and Astrobrite. He contributed cover art photography to Lovesliescrushing's second album Xuvetyn and performed 12-string electric guitar with that band on their 1995 East Coast tour. With Astrobrite, Prinz performed as guitarist in 1995-1996 at both live shows and recording sessions. Prinz also worked with Massais in the music project Century Wheatfield, who debuted in 1995 at the Odeon Theatre in East Lansing, Michigan, with an algorithmic video presentation by Ren√© Corriveau; their recordings and the video are assumed lost. History Mahogany's first release, the Dual-Group split 12\\" EP with fellow Michigan band Auburn Lull, was released in 1997 on Burnt Hair Records. Prinz and Massais were joined by Prinz's sister, keyboardist Marissa von Wohl (Marissa Kaloga), and the group released various recordings on indie labels such as Tinseltones and Liquefaction. Mahogany established their own provisional label, Simdisc (aka Disques de Simultanes), in 1998 as an equity-driven concern to provide budgeting capital for the group's releases when little or no capital was available for printing or promotion (Simdisc was subsumed by Renovo and Studio Renovo upon the inception of the Renovo concept in May 2003). The 1997 EP What Will Become of the Key of Reason? was reissued jointly by Simdisc and Clairecords in 1998. The group's debut full-length album, The Dream of a Modern Day, was recorded in 1998 (augmented by Asha Vida's Jesse Rafferty on percussion) and was initially issued on Burnt Hair in 2000, then reissued in 2001 on Darla Records (CD) and Simdisc/Burnt Hair (LP). Massais left the band after the recording of the album. In 1999, Prinz and von Wohl relocated to Brooklyn, New York. Joined by several additional musicians (they eventually grew to an octet and even larger live ensembleshttp://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/the-many-shades-of-mahogany- a-byt-interview-with-andrew-prinz.htm), Mahogany issued additional compilation tracks. The band's oeuvre was collected on the 1995 Darla 2-CD set Memory Column: Early Works and Rarities 1996-2004. The group's second album, Connectivity!, featuring production work on several tracks by Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins, was issued as a double-CD on Darla in 2006. In February 2007, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted Connectivity! No. 4 on their 2006 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame. On November 18, 2009, Prinz declared the ensemble to be \\"a sovereign city-state canton-town within the country of Renovo.\\" He also said: \\"Mahogany recognizes the corridor concept city-state Newphilyorkadelphia and the wilds between and beyond. Mahogany seeks rewilding, cessation of egregious production of petroleum-based transportation, integration of city concepts and environs, and reification of both high-speed rail and interurban electric traction.\\" The band announced their signing to BLVD Records on September 27, 2011.http://www.mahogany.nu/?p=248 In 2013, Mahogany (down to a duo of Prinz and Jaclyn Slimm) issued a digital single, \\"Phase Break\\".http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/10/mahogany_ready.html Discography =Studio albums= * The Dream of a Modern Day (2000, Burnt Hair Records; 2001 Darla Records/Clairecords) * Connectivity!

It stars Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as two adventurous little girls who discover that their Great Aunt Sophia has been trapped and cursed by her evil twin sister Agatha. On the 7th year of her imprisonment, Sophia will be doomed to the netherworld unless the curse is broken by the magical spell of twins. The film's title is part of the famous line spoken by the three witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth (Act IV, Scene I): \\"Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble.\\" Plot Kelly (Mary-Kate Olsen) and Lynn Farmer's (Ashley Olsen) parents, Don (Eric McCormack) and Christine (Kelli Fox), are deeply in debt and in danger of losing their home. During the Halloween season, they visit Christine's cold and cruel Aunt Agatha (Cloris Leachman) to ask for a loan, which is immediately refused. While the girls wait outside, they meet Agatha's grave digger (Wayne Robson) who tells them the story of Agatha's twin sister Sophia (also played by Cloris Leachman) who is trapped inside the house. He explains to the girls that Agatha's home once belonged to a powerful witch who, before being burned at the stake 200 years before, had hidden her moonstone, the rare gem which gave her power. As children, Agatha and Sophia, tired of being twins, heard the tale and began looking for the stone in hopes of using its power to no longer be identical. Agatha found the moonstone but hid it from her sister and instead began using the magic it possessed to make her sister's life miserable. Years later on Halloween, Sophia and her fianc√© George (Matthew Walker), now Agatha's butler, prepared to elope and begin their life together, but Agatha, out of jealously and rage, cast a spell that banished her sister into the netherworld through a mirror, which she keeps hidden in the attic. On the 7th year at midnight, this Halloween, the spell will become permanent and there will be no way for Sophia to be rescued. Back at home, Kelly and Lynn learn of their parents' financial problems. Christine expresses that if Aunt Sophia were still around, she would be able to help them. Knowing this, the girls begin a rescue mission to free Aunt Sophia before it is too late. The spell can only be broken by twins who have possession of the moonstone, so Kelly and Lynn's ultimate goal is to apprehend it. The only problem is, Aunt Agatha wears the gem around her neck at all times. While out trick or treating, they swap costumes with two other kids so they are able to get away from their parents. The first person they meet is a homeless man who dreams of money and stardom, Mr. N (Meshach Taylor), who offers to help the girls because they should not be on such a dangerous journey without an adult. The girls carry with them a toy magic wand that they won at a Halloween party, which actually has unexplained genuine magical powers (though it is heavily implied that the twins have the magical powers and not the wand). Kelly, Lynn and Mr. N visit a phony psychic to ask where they are able to find the witches gathering that Aunt Agatha will attend that night. Lulu is unable to answer and instead they use the wand to find the location and set off again by hitching a ride on a pumpkin truck. They get dropped off near a woods and find a small house deep inside, the home of a man named Oscar (Phil Fondacaro) who wishes to be taller. They tell him the whole story and he agrees to go along with them. Meanwhile, Don and Christine discover the girls have gone and inform the police. Aunt Agatha overhears the girls' plan using the magic mirror and begins a plan to get rid of them. She is threatened by their presence because she knows that the power of twins combined is superior to her own. Kelly, Lynn, Mr. N and Oscar turn up at the gathering in costumes in hopes of fitting in and they oversee the events inside. Aunt Agatha reveals the story of her spell on her sister to the crowd while Mr. N and Oscar create a plan to try to get her to hand over the moonstone, which she does, intrigued by their promise to double her power. However, they are soon found out and are chased through town. They decide to split up; Lynn, who has the moonstone, with Oscar, and Kelly goes with Mr. N. Followed by Agatha and her butler, Kelly and Mr. N run into a dead end at an abandoned warehouse. Mr. N goes out to confront Agatha, but she turns him into a crow, leaving Kelly alone. Later on, Aunt Sophia appears to Kelly, expressing that Lynn and Oscar have freed her, but Kelly realizes it is a trick and that Aunt Agatha has transformed herself to try and catch her. She manages to get away but is then gets caught by George when she flees from the building. Mr. N, as a crow, finds Lynn and Oscar to tell them what has happened (but not before puncturing one of Agatha's tires off-screen to help Lynn and Oscar buy time). Lynn starts to panic, since her and Kelly have never been apart and Kelly is probably scared all by herself. In the same part of town, Lynn finds where Mr. Gravedigger lives and goes to ask for his help in getting to Agatha‚Äôs house. On their way, the police officer looking for the girls sees them driving away. She informs Don and Christine where she saw them, and Christine realizes it is near Aunt Agatha's mansion so that is probably where they are heading. Fifteen minutes to midnight, the group break into the house to search for the mirror. Lynn hears Aunt Sophia crying out for help in the attic and she goes to investigate. The good news is, Lynn has the moonstone, but the bad news is, Kelly is not there, and she needs both twins to free her. Minutes later, Agatha, George and Kelly arrive. Agatha tries to persuade Lynn into betraying her sister, but Lynn refuses. Still, she promises to hand over the moonstone if Agatha lets everyone go, to which Agatha agrees. Lynn places the moonstone on the floor and then Aunt Agatha breaks her end of the promise, threatening to turn everybody into animals forever. Mr. N flies down the staircase and snatches the moonstone away in his beak, while Kelly escapes from George's watch and the girls flee upstairs to free Sophia together. Oscar and Gravedigger are turned into turtles when they make their last stand towards Agatha. The twins ask Sophia what the incantation is, but Sophia reveals that it has to come from their hearts. Aunt Agatha bursts into the room laughing, revealing that it is after midnight. Lynn and Kelly tell each other that they love each other and want to be sisters no matter what anybody else says or thinks, and Sophia is finally freed. Lynn explains she pushed the clock ahead by five minutes, so it was not too late after all. Enraged, Agatha attempts to push her sister back into the mirror, but the twins fight back and Agatha falls into the mirror herself. All of Agatha's dark magic is destroyed and the mirror is shattered, thus trapping her in the netherworld forever. Don and Christine arrive at the mansion to find Sophia safe and happily returned. Everyone keeps what happened a secret, preferring to tell them that Agatha went on a long trip to \\"reflect\\". Kelly and Lynn thank their new friends for helping them out: Mr. Gravedigger for his courage and bravery when standing up to \\"you know who\\", Oscar for his fabulous plans and distractions, and Mr. N for being their first companion who looked out for them on the road. He tells them he has also learned that money is just money and that friends are more important. Aunt Sophia and George fall in love all over again, and redecorate the mansion so it is a second home for the whole family. She also agrees to give the Farmers the money they need to save their home. Days later while enjoying family time in the garden, Lynn and Kelly are cleaning up the broken mirror in the attic and they see Aunt Agatha in one of the broken pieces. She asks for help, but the twins say \\"No chance\\" and walk out of the attic while holding hands and the magic wand.

The ground was sold to Thor Specialities Ltd in January 2012 and the football club were forced to leave the stadium. Assets from the ground are set to be sold, with Cheshire West and Chester Council benefitting from the sale money. History Fabio da Silva playing for Manchester United Reserves against Chelsea Reserves at the Victoria Stadium in 2008. Following the sale of the Drill Field, Northwich's former ground in 2003, and a ground-sharing agreement with Witton Albion, Northwich moved into the Victoria Stadium in 2005. The stadium was located on a site in Wincham Business Park. The Trent and Mersey Canal passes behind the stadium and separates Northwich from their fiercest rivals Witton Albion. On 17 August 2005, Northwich played their first game at the ground, beating Gainsborough Trinity 2‚Äì0. The ground was officially opened on 30 November 2006 by Sir Alex Ferguson, who fielded a Manchester United team in a friendly match. Manchester United Reserves played at the ground for 14 months in 2007‚Äì08 and 2008‚Äì09 reserve seasons. In February 2008, the ground was used for filming a new Nike advert, directed by Guy Ritchie and featuring Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. It was one of only three grounds, along with the Camp Nou in Barcelona and the Emirates Stadium in London, to be selected by Nike for filming. The future of the stadium was cast into doubt in January 2009, when then owner Mike Connett removed safety equipment from the ground; this forced Northwich to temporarily move to rivals Altrincham's Moss Lane and Witton Albion's Wincham Park grounds. It also spelt the end of Manchester United Reserve's tenancy at the stadium, as they moved their permanent home, who also moved to Moss Lane. A team consisting of actors from Cheshire-based soap Hollyoaks and an All-Star XI consisting of former professional footballers and special guests played at the stadium on 10 October 2009 in a charity match for St. Luke's Hospice in Winsford. A record attendance of 3,154 was achieved on the penultimate game of the 2005‚Äì06 season, when Northwich defeated their nearest rivals Stafford Rangers 3‚Äì1 to win the Conference North, however this was bettered in the 2009‚Äì10 season on 28 November when Northwich played Lincoln City in the Second Round of the FA Cup, a game which was witnessed by 3,544 spectators. Stands The main stand at the Victoria Stadium The main Victoria Stand had a seating capacity of 1,180 supporters. It housed the club offices, shop, changing rooms for players and match officials, kit room, medical facilities, treatment room, fitness centre, staff and public toilets. Rare for a non- league ground, there was several executive boxes situated above the outdoor seats. The stand was also home to a bar and two restaurants. The green and yellow seating on this stand spelt out 'NVFC', the acronym for the club. The terraced Dane Bank Stand had a capacity of 2,988 spectators, and was moved from the club's original Drill Field ground in Northwich Town Centre following the stadium's demolition. Following the closure of the Victoria Stadium, the Dane Bank Stand was once again moved. The steel-work was re-fabricated and is now the \\"Saint Mary's Road End\\" terrace at FC United of Manchester's Broadhurst Park ground. Both of the goal-ends were open, and could accommodate 434 spectators each. References Category:Northwich Victoria F.C.

It is set in Manhattan, and follows a ten-year-old boy as he experiences his first love. Plot Gabe, an adventurous young boy, lives in Manhattan with his parents who are on the verge of divorcing. Gabe spends most of his free time exploring the city on his scooter. His daily exploits are followed and encouraged by the friendly concierge at his building. Gabe encounters Rosemary, an 11-year-old classmate whom he's known since kindergarten, in a self-defense class. After being partnered with her for sparring, he suddenly notices her as a girl, not another face. To Gabe's elation, they begin spending time together and he is completely enamored with not only her, but her life. Rosemary lives with her loving upper-class parents on the edge of Central Park. One day, Gabe takes Rosemary on a tour through Central Park, and another day they venture across the city for fun and try to inspect an apartment for rent, worrying Gabe's nervous parents. Rosemary's parents take them to hear a jazz pianist at The Carlyle, where the young twosome finally hold hands. After the show, Rosemary's parents tell them to say goodnight and her parents go to get milk. After they walk off, Gabe and Rosemary begin talking, and he interrupts her by kissing her. Rosemary's family's life is in contrast to Gabe's; his parents have declared an awkward truce while waiting for their divorce to be finalized. As their relationship progresses, Gabe begins to question what is happening to him and why he is falling in love with Rosemary. To complicate matters, he discovers Rosemary is going to summer camp for six weeks and her parents are enrolling her in a private school when she returns. When things seem to be going perfectly, Gabe's world is turned upside down when he and Rosemary are assigned new sparring partners. Gabe is jealous of Rosemary's new partner, a tall blonde boy who's much better at self-defense than Gabe is. With their remaining time running out, Gabe tries to get closer to Rosemary, but only drives her away. In a desperate move to win Rosemary back, Gabe attempts to show off and earn his yellow belt, but painfully fractures his hand in the process. Being crushed with what love really is, he learns from his father that his parents' marriage fell apart because of things left unsaid. Realizing he is running out of time, Gabe goes to find Rosemary at a wedding reception she is attending and declares his love. Taken aback, Rosemary replies she doesn't think she is ready for love, but is really happy to see Gabe and asks him to dance. As they dance, Gabe muses that he and Rosemary were on different paths ‚Äî \\"like two ships that passed in Sheep Meadow\\". He returns home to find his parents laughing over their honeymoon recollections. Gabe is pleased and surprised when his father says he \\"cleared out some old stuff\\" and his parents appear to have reconciled. They happily go out for dinner, and as the movie ends, Gabe, narrating, summarizes what Rosemary meant to him: \\"...I'm never gonna get another first love.

It holds a 77% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with 24 positive reviews out of 31. The site's consensus states: \\"Little Manhattan is a sweet story of young love that provides an enlightening if pragmatic view on love and courtship.\\" BBC's Stella Papamichael wrote that the film was \\"sweet but not syrupy and heart-warming without being manipulative, this kid flick stands tall among recent Hollywood love stories\\". Kevin Thomas, writing for the Los Angeles Times, called the film \\"a handsome charmer about the avalanche of first love...an endearing, affectionately humorous and even lyrical depiction of the dawning of adolescence amid the privileged\\". However he called the script \\"problematic...[Gabe's] speech as soundtrack narrator of his own story is precociously improbable\\". Jeffrey Lyons of NBC-TV called Little Manhattan \\"one of the sweetest, most touching films you'll see\\". Varietys Brian Lowry was less positive about the film. He wrote \\"Resting almost entirely on the shoulders of its young leads, both they and the pic lack the sparkle to sustain what seeks to be a whimsical premise but, except for a few moments, proves ponderous instead.\\" He also believed the film belonged on \\"youth- targeting basic-cable networks\\" instead of having a cinematic release. Metacritic gave the movie a score of 52 based on 10 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". =Box office= The film made $36,397 in the opening weekend in the United States. By December 18, 2005 the film had grossed $385,373. It had worldwide box office takings of $1,117,920. Music The film's score was composed by Chad Fischer, the guitarist and lead singer of Lazlo Bane. The film also featured 18 other songs, half of which are covers, by a variety of musicians, from the well-known The Beatles and Elvis Presley to little-known The Meadows and Loston Harris. Chad Fischer contributed several songs to the film both as a performer and producer. The soundtrack album for the film hasn't been released, making half of the songs used exclusive to the film. =Track listing= *A Available on other releases *B Available to listen on Chad Fischer's Myspace pageChad Fischer , on Myspace *C Available by original and/or other musicians References =Notes= =References= External links  Category:2005 films Category:2000s romantic comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American children's films Category:American coming-of-age films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Films shot in New York City Category:American independent films Category:Regency Enterprises films Category:Films scored by Chad Fischer Category:2005 directorial debut films Category:2005 comedy films ","title":"Little Manhattan"},{"id":"4865877","text":"The Kadaru are a sub-ethnic group of the Nuba peoples in the Nuba Mountains of South Kordofan state, in southern Sudan.

History  Colab came together as a collective in 1977, first using the name Green Corporation, and initially received a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Workshop Grant through Center for New Art Activities, Inc., a small not-for-profit organization formed in 1974. In 1978, Collaborative Projects was incorporated as a not-for-profit and later received its tax- exempt status from the IRS, so that it could apply for grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and other sources independently.Julie Ault. Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985 University of Minnesota Press, 2002: p.217 Colab was active for about 10 years and became distinguished by the raw energy of its members and sometimes politically engaged open membership. By raising its own sources of funding, Colab was in control of its own exhibitions and cable TV shows.Max Schumann (ed.) A Book about Colab (and Related Activities) Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: pp.9-11 Advocating a form of cultural activism that was purely artist driven, the group created artworks, negotiated venues, curated shows, crafted their own PR, and engaged in discourse that responded to the political themes and predicaments of their time, among them the recessions of the 1970s, the Reagan era of budget cuts and nuclear armament, the housing crisis and gentrification in New York City, and other pressing social issues.Max Schumann (ed.) A Book about Colab (and Related Activities) Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: pp.9-11  Projects  From November 1978, different artist members organized and installed original one- off group shows in their own studios or other temporary sites, such as The Batman Show, (591 Broadway 1979), Income and Wealth Show (5 Bleecker Street Store 1979), Doctors and Dentists Show (591 Broadway 1979), The Manifesto Show (5 Bleecker Street Store 1979), The Dog Show (591 Broadway 1979), Just Another Asshole Show (5 Bleecker Street Store), The Real Estate Show (Delancey Street, Jan. 1980), Jay Street Film Shows (1979), Exhibit A (93 Grand Street, 1979) and, most notably, The Times Square Show (201 W 41st, June 1980): a large open exhibition near the center of New York's entertainment (and pornography) district (Times Square) that was put on with Bronx-based Fashion Moda.Max Schumann (ed.) A Book about Colab (and Related Activities) Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: pp.120-135 Seed money from the first Colab (Green Corp.) workshop grant through Center for New Art Inc. led to the creation of the Colab artists' TV series on Manhattan Cable (1978‚Äì1984) that included All Color News,Kenneth Goldsmith, Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb, Columbia University Press, New York, p. 274Colab 78-80 (1978-80): Anybody's Show; End of the World; July 4, 1980; Real Estate Show; Shipwreck; Dance of the Leper; All Color News (Colab) Potato Wolf and Red Curtain, and New Cinema - a screening room on 8th Street and St. Mark's Place for new wave Super 8 films transferred to video and projected on an Advent screen - the continued publication of X Motion Picture Magazine(1979) (whose first issue preceded the formation of Colab);Marc Masters, (2007) No Wave, Black Dog Publishing, London, p. 141 support and inspiration for the ABC No Rio cultural center (1980-82 - ongoing) that was created as a result of The Real Estate Show; support of Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine (1984), NightShift Theater 1979, Spanner Magazine (3 issues 1979), MWF Video Club (established in 1986) and Bomb Magazine (1981).Carlo McCormick, The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974‚Äì1984, Princeton University Press, 2006 Membership in Colab shifted and evolved over the years, and some members of the original group are still highly visible active making art. In 2009, ABC No Rio was awarded a $1.6 million capital construction grant from the City of New York. Quotations \\"We [Collaborative Projects] are functioning as a group of artists with complementary resources and skills providing a solid ground for collaborative work directed to the needs of the community-at-large. Specifically we are involved in programs facilitating development, production, and distribution of collaborative works. These works are realized in various media including film and video for distribution and cable-cast, and live cable TV broadcasts, as well as other more conventional art media such as graphics and printed materials.\\"The Red Book, 1978 (NEA application document authored by Coleen Fitzgibbon, Andrea Callard and Ulli Rimkus) Andrea Callard Papers, The Downtown Collection, Fales Library, NYU \\"This statement (the one above) defines three fundamental aspects of Colab - members' desire to create and distribute \\"collaborative work\\" under the umbrella of an artist-run organization, their focus on new media versus traditional art objects and their openness to a range of aesthetic styles that would meet the \\"needs of the community-at-large.\\" This last point was critical to the group's identity and served as the foundation of a workshop-oriented administration that encouraged experimentation in many different areas, including but not limited to TV production, video editing, film, and performance art. With various workshops operating simultaneously and the participants' ability to draw on like-minded members as partners, Colab could produce many projects without the burden of an institutional identity. Typically, individual members worked together on more than one project in small subgroups that changed and over lapped from one project to the next.\\" David Little, Artjournal pdf file In 1980, artists emulating 1970s Puerto Rican activists seized a building on New York's Lower East Side and opened it as a collectively run cultural center. ABC No Rio was passed on to successive managements until today it is an anarchist cultural center run by a collective with close ties to the publishing group Autonomedia.\\"Alan W.

The first artists' group to achieve prominence in New York was Colab (Collaborative Projects), which produced a show in Times Square in 1980.

A forty-member democratically run membership group; Colab inspired other artists to form groups and mount huge shows in Brooklyn lofts, not to mention collaboration with the Washington Project for the Arts, for the Ritz Hotel Project in Washington, D.C. in 1983. A Book About Colab (and Related Activities) In 2016 A Book About Colab (and Related Activities) was published by Printed Matter, Inc. It was edited by Max Schumann, the director of Printed Matter, and contained a Foreword and Afterword by art writer and Colab member Walter Robinson. The book traces the output of Collaborative Projects from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s and serves as an exhaustive homage to the group‚Äôs work and a testimonial about their particular practice of collaboration, collectivity, and social engagement, while reflecting an iconic period of NYC cultural history.Max Schumann (ed.) A Book about Colab (and Related Activities) Printed Matter, Inc, 2016: p.9 In keeping with the democratic \\"by and for artists\\" ethos of Colab, the publication places this material alongside newly solicited texts from many of the group‚Äôs members ‚Äì a mix of reflections and anecdotes, statements, manifestos, and excerpts from the ‚ÄòColab Annual Report‚Äô, which provide a close perspective on the meaning of Colab for those who came into its orbit.

The show's name was taken from Kenneth Wolstenholme's famous 1966 World Cup commentary quotation, \\"they think it's all over...it is now!\\" and the show used the phrase to sign off each episode. In 2006 the show's run ended after 11 years on air. Overview The show was originally presented by comedian Nick Hancock. Retired England football team captain Gary Lineker and former England cricket team captain David Gower were team captains from 1995 until they announced their retirement from the show in 2003. They were replaced as team captains by former England football goalkeeper David Seaman and former England cricketer Phil Tufnell. Former footballer Ian Wright took over from David Seaman in autumn 2004. From October 2005, Boris Becker replaced Tufnell and Lee Mack took over from Hancock as host. Occasionally, a team captain was unable to appear on the show due to other commitments so guest captains were drafted in. Six times World Snooker Champion Steve Davis was a regular choice as guest captain, while Matthew Pinsent, Mark Lawrenson, Mick McCarthy, Sam Torrance, Steve Backley, Sharron Davies, Linford Christie and Michael Johnson also appeared in this role. Additionally, Ian Wright was a guest captain before becoming a permanent team captain. Each team also had a regular panellist. For the team which was originally captained by Gary Lineker this was Rory McGrath for the show's entire run. David Gower was originally teamed up with Lee Hurst. Hurst left the show in 1997 (although he made a reappearance in 2004 on David Seaman's team) and was replaced for the next two series by a rotating line-up of comedians ‚Äì Jonathan Ross, Jo Brand, Alan Davies, Julian Clary and Phill Jupitus. Despite regularly admitting to having limited sporting knowledge, Ross became the permanent panellist until leaving the show in 2006, and was replaced by Sean Lock for the World Cup and summer sports special editions. The third member of each team varied from week to week, and would typically be a notable sportsperson, broadcaster or comedian. The show was originally produced for BBC Radio 5, where it was hosted by Des Lynam. The devisers, Simon Bullivant and Bill Matthews, started work on a TV version in 1993 but it was two years before it made it to air. Des Lynam did record a pilot in early 1994 but decided not to do the already commissioned series, which was then put on hold. In 1999 and 2001, as part of the BBC's Comic Relief broadcasts, one- off special programmes were made called Have I Got Buzzcocks All Over. They combined elements of the show with Have I Got News for You and Never Mind the Buzzcocks, with Angus Deayton as host. In 2002 and 2004, as part of the BBC's Sport Relief broadcasts, one-off special programmes were made called They Think It's All A Question of Sport. They combined elements of the show with A Question of Sport, with Stephen Fry as host. Kenneth Wolstenholme was unhappy with the use of the phrase for the title of the show. He wrote in his autobiography that he had contacted the BBC to find out what relevance the title had to his most famous line, uttered 30 years earlier. However, when the show was first commissioned, he did accept a fee to re-record his famous commentary for the opening titles, as the original was unusable. =Rounds= Throughout the series, the rounds varied each week. Examples include: *Excuses, where the teams are shown a clip of a sportsperson or a team, and are asked what excuse they gave for a sporting or personal misdemeanour. Examples include Tommy Docherty explaining that Scotland lost 7‚Äì0 in the 1954 World Cup to Uruguay because \\"they were shattered just standing for the National Anthem\\", and Scottish tennis player Andy Murray claimed that he vomited on the court at the US Open in 2005 because he'd been drinking an isotonic drink to stop him from cramping, but he drank too much too quickly. On a special edition video-only episode of No Holds Barred, Gary's team was asked for Tommy Docherty's excuse for Manchester United's infamous relegation of 1973‚Äì74, with Lineker's answer \\"He wanted to bring pleasure to millions?\\". Another edition of the excuses round saw Manchester United fans blame Rod Stewart for costing their team the 1991-92 League title to Leeds United by ruining their Old Trafford pitch at a concert in the pre-season delaying vital pitch maintenance. *Celebrations, where the teams are shown a clip of a sportsperson celebrating in a fanciful way, and are asked what the celebration is in aid of. Examples include Arsenal striker Thierry Henry celebrating a goal by recreating the Budweiser \\"Whassup?\\" advert, and Manchester United midfielder Lee Sharpe celebrating a goal by recreating a pose of his boyhood hero Elvis Presley. *Sporting Bluff, in which the teams are given three statements about a sportsperson and have to guess which one is true. *What's Going On?, where the teams are shown a sporting clip and are asked to decipher what's going on, quite literally. Examples include former cricket umpire Dickie Bird taking part in a photo opportunity with the Yorkshire players picked for the England cricket team, dressed in a chef's outfit and cooking them Yorkshire puddings, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships in Finland, and Scottish Youth Dance Company dancer Andy Howitt recreating Michael Owen's goal against Argentina in the 1998 FIFA World Cup as a ballet dance. *Photo Opportunities, where each team is shown a photo of a sportsperson in an unfamiliar pose and asked what the circumstances behind the photos were. Examples include swimmer Sharron Davies beside two men dressed as chips to promote National Chip Week, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson partnering with The Wombles for a campaign against litter in Manchester, and serial practical joker (and Eric Cantona lookalike) Karl Power joining the Manchester United team for a photo before a Champions League match in 2001. *Photo-fit, where the teams are shown a picture of three sportspersons merged into one. The teams then have to guess who they are. Sometimes after the sportspersons are revealed, they are asked for the connection between them for a bonus point. On many occasions, Rory McGrath liked to joke that he recognised the person in the photo as an ex-girlfriend he'd previously had sexual encounters with. *Author Author, in which the teams hear an extract from a sporting autobiography or interview and attempt to identify the author. Quotes include former Liverpool F.C. manager G√©rard Houllier on why he turned down offers of international coaching, cricket umpire Shakoor Rana offering his opinion on Mike Gatting following an on-pitch argument, and a quote from athlete Roger Black's autobiography on his admiration of David Gower. *Sing When You're Winning, in which the teams must complete the lyrics to a sporting song, poem or chant performed by football fans or the Barmy Army. A memorable moment from this round saw Chris Eubank complete a poem by Barnsley-supporting poet Ian McMillan, with the line \\"I'm having a laugh\\", when the line was \\"We'll be champions come May\\". One of the more memorable reactions to not winning this round occurred when Matthew Corbett and Sooty were guests and when denied points, Sooty went on to squirt Nick in the face with a water pistol. *Handbags, where the teams must work out the reasons for a rift between sportspersons. Examples of rifts include football team Peterborough United F.C. and Victoria Beckham over the rights to use the nickname \\"Posh\\", and athlete David Bedford and communications company InfoNXX over the 118 118 runners looking like him. *Grandstand, in which the teams are shown a bizarre multi-sport event and are asked to come up with events played in them. These include the Eskimo Olympics, the Naked Olympics and the Tough Guy Sports. *The Treble, where the teams are shown three sportspersons and three items, and have to link each sportsperson to an item. *The Beckham Challenge, where the teams are asked an on-the-buzzer question about David Beckham and his family. The first team to get the answer right gets further bonus questions, similar to University Challenge. This was later changed to having separate questions for each team. Variants to this round include Sven-Mania (with questions about then-England manager Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson), Wayne-Mania (with questions about Wayne Rooney) and Gaffer-Mania (with questions about football managers in general). *Electronic Pencil, where the teams are shown a brief sporting clip, which is then paused, or a doctored photo of a sportsperson with items removed. The teams use the electronic pencil to predict the direction of the athlete or the ball, or what the missing items were. The round was dropped after series 2 but revived for the 100th show in 2001. *Half-Time, where each team is shown a clip of sporting footage with the sound removed and asked to provide their own dub over the clip. The teams were not awarded points for this segment, which was dropped after series 2. Clips used include vintage footage of the Eton wall game (which David's team overdubbed as David Gower's Schooldays) and coverage of the O.J. Simpson low-speed police chase (with Alistair McGowan dubbing over it as Trevor Brooking and Alan Hansen on Match of the Day). *Injury Board, in which the teams pick a number between 1 and 12. Behind each number is a sports person and another person or item. The teams try to work out how the latter injured the former. Examples include Newbury rugby club and some Vaseline (to which guest Julian Clary suggested \\"maybe there was sand in it\\") and Dennis Wise and a toilet seat. This round was also a parody of A Question of Sport, another BBC TV quiz show. *Feel The Sportsman, one of the most popular rounds of the show, in which the regular panellists have to try to identify a mystery guest, or their sporting notability, by touch whilst blindfolded. Guests subjected to a groping include Will Carling, Ashia Hansen, Henry Cooper, Lucinda Green, Geoff Capes, Victor Ubogu, Jonah Lomu (who infamously appeared minutes after Chris Eubank had been goaded into calling him \\"a big poof\\"), Andy Fordham, Manc Union Paintball Team, Arsenal Women's Football Team (which Rory guessed right on the whistle), Aylesbury United F.C. in their infamous 1995 FA Cup duck conga goal celebration, a preserved Mick the Miller, the Subbuteo Gary Lineker, a cardboard cutout of Roy of the Rovers, Tony Bullimore, Stirling Moss and the aforementioned Karl Power. One notable variant in 2001 saw the regulars feeling an animal, having been shown a clip of Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson on Italian television trying to identify animals by touch alone. David Gower and Jonathan Ross correctly guessed their animal (a zebra) but Gary Lineker and Rory McGrath failed to get theirs (an alligator ‚Äì they failed to even touch it), with McGrath and Lineker removing their blindfolds and running off the set in panic. Occasionally, the guests get to play in lieu of one of the regulars; a notable example was Sharron Davies, when the sportsman was her then husband Derek Redmond, whom she recognised. *Claim To Fame, introduced in 2005, saw a sportsperson subjected to a line of questioning by the panel to determine their claim to fame. Mystery people include Paul Barber (a member of the gold medal winning British 1988 Olympic hockey team), Judy Grinham (gold medal winning 100m backstroke swimmer at the 1956 Olympics) and Tommy Gemmell, from the Celtic European Cup winning team of 1967. *The Physical Challenge, where the teams are subject to displaying their physique on an exercise bike, tricycle or other exercise apparatus. The harder they pedal, the faster an image appears on screen, and the teams must name the image before moving onto the next one. The team captain starts off before a klaxon is sounded, then the regular sidekick takes over. The guests occasionally had a turn as well. *The Name Game, in which the regular sidekick has to give clues about a famous sportsperson for the other team members to guess. Variants include the sidekick having to draw out the clues, giving clues as to team names and performing impressions, or miming of the sportsperson. One famous incident in this round saw Rory get a point deduction for giving clues like \\"Same first name as Ian Rush, same last name as Ian Botham\\". Rory also got away with pretending Gary gave an answer when he had not, by saying \\"That's right, speak up!\\". He also criticised the media hype over Ryan Giggs's winning FA Cup semi- final goal against Arsenal, by giving the clue \\"Welsh football player, scored what is probably the most overrated goal of the season\\". *Sporting Vogue, introduced in 2005, where the team captain has to strike a famous pose by a sportsperson for their teammates to guess. *School Sports Day, shown only on the video-exclusive No Holds Barred episode, was a pre-recorded segment featuring the regulars participating in a school sports day at King's College School as though it was covered by Grandstand, with Nick as the presenter and Gerald Sinstadt as the commentator. The events were the Egg-and-spoon race, the Three-legged race, the Egg Catching (with England cricketer Nasser Hussain throwing the eggs), the Obstacle course and the Sack race. Although Gary won the individual contest, David's team earned more points in the sports day and back in the studio were awarded one point for their efforts. *Grand Prix, shown only on the video-exclusive Full Throttle episode, was another pre- recorded segment featuring the regulars participating in a six-lap race in \\"Formula 27 dinky cars\\" at Silverstone, using similar on-screen graphics to Formula 1 coverage on ITV at the time (even breaking into a \\"commercial break\\" for the No Holds Barred video near to the climax of the race, only to return just before Lee span off the track, which was ripping on ITV holding commercial breaks during key moments in the races), and a commentator imitating Murray Walker. Lee and David raced in Williams-coloured cars, while Gary and Rory raced in Jordan-liveried cars. Lee span out on the final lap and was disqualified. David won the race, winning 10 points for his team. Gary and Rory finished joint second, winning 5 points each, thus leading to Nick back in the studio declaring the race \\"a complete waste of a day\\". =Tie- Breakers= All episodes ending with a tie score or series ending with the number of episodes tied finish with a tie-breaker. Sometimes, the tie-breaker refers to incidents from previously in the episode. These have included: *A sports general knowledge question, sometimes from the quiz books endorsed by team captains Gary Lineker or David Gower. *An episode featuring England cricket captain Nasser Hussain ended with Nick tossing a coin and getting Nasser, who had previous bad luck with coin tosses, to call Heads or Tails. He got it wrong, saying '&$%¬£ing Tails' as Nick showed him the result. *A game of musical chairs featuring the regulars. *A mechanical bull or surfboard, which the panellists (usually Jonathan Ross versus Rory McGrath, or Jonathan versus his brother Paul in the surfboard example) ride, with the panellist who stays on for the longest before falling off winning. *A game of round-the-table table tennis between all the panellists. *A game of Paper-Scissors-Stone between David and Gary. (Gary and Rory were spotted by Nick discussing tactics.) *An arm-wrestling match between David and Gary. *A \\"pseudo sumo\\" match between David and Gary, with the two captains in inflatable sumo suits. *A race between David and Gary on tea trays with wheels, in honour of British Winter Olympic bronze medalist skeleton racer Alex Coomber *A pre-recorded race between two hamsters in moving wheels - David picked the 'winner' first; Gary's hamster was shown travelling backwards. *A \\"black ball fight\\" (first to pot the only ball) on a miniature snooker set. Guest captain Steve Davis was required to wear glasses which affected his depth perception due to him being a world champion snooker player. *A wrestling match in a pool of mashed potato between David and Gary, with the audience cheering for who they thought won. *A coconut shy-type game where, following a dressing room incident between Alex Ferguson and David Beckham where Ferguson reportedly kicked a football boot which hit Beckham in the head, all the panelists took turns to kick a football boot at cardboard cut-outs of Beckham's face. *A toy fishing game between Phil Tufnell and David Seaman. *A game of blow football between Boris Becker and Ian Wright.

Founded in 1339, it is the third largest university in France with about 60,000 students and over 3,000 researchers. Established as the University of Grenoble by Humbert II of Viennois, it split in 1971 following the May 1968 events. Three of the University of Grenoble's inheritors‚ÄîJoseph Fourier University, Pierre Mend√®s-France University, and Stendhal University‚Äîreunited in 2016 to restore the original institution under the name Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. The university is organized around two closely located urban campuses: Domaine Universitaire of 175 ha which straddles Saint-Martin-d'H√®res and Gi√®res, and Campus GIANT of 250 ha in Grenoble. UGA also owns and operates facilities in Valence, Chamb√©ry, Les Houches, Villar-d'Ar√™ne, Mirabel, √âchirolles, and La Tronche. The city of Grenoble is one of the largest scientific centers in Europe, hosting facilities of every existing public research institution in France. This allows UGA to have hundreds of research and teaching partnerships, including close collaboration with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). Overall, Grenoble as a city is the largest research center in France after Paris with 22,800 researchers. In April 2019, UGA is selected to host one of the four French institutes in artificial intelligence. UGA is traditionally known for its research and education in the natural sciences and engineering, but also law, institutional economics, linguistics, and psychology. It has been cited among the best and most innovative universities in Europe.https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global- universities/europe It is also renowned for its academic research in humanities and political sciences, hosting some of the largest research centers in France in fields such as political science, urban planning or the sociology of organizations. History =Early history (1339‚Äì1800)= Humbert II of Viennois, the university's founder First official seal The University of Grenoble was founded on May 12, 1339 by Humbert II of Viennois, the last independent ruler of Dauphin√©, a state of the Holy Roman Empire. Its purpose was to teach civil and canon law, medicine, and the liberal arts. It was considered a leader in the Renaissance revival of the classics and development of liberal arts. Humbert's actions were inspired by his granduncle Robert, King of Naples, at whose royal court Humbert spent his youth. King Robert, known as the Wise, skillfully developed Naples from a small port to a lavish city and had a reputation of a cultured man and a generous patron of the arts, friends with such great minds as Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Giotto.Kelly, Samantha, The New Solomon: Robert of Naples (1309-1343) and Fourteenth-Century Kingship, page 2 Google Books Such rich experience contributed to Humbert's intention to create a university in his own state, and to do so he visited Pope Benedict XII to get a papal bull of approval. Humbert cared deeply about his students, offering generous aid, protection, and even providing a hundred of them with free housing. Humbert's financial losses during the Smyrniote crusades, Black Death, and Dauphin√©'s attachment to France have greatly decreased the activity of the university leading to its closure, since a small mountainous town couldn't support its activity on its own. It was reopened again by Louis XI of France in 1475 in Valence under the name University of Valence, while the original university was restored in Grenoble in 1542 by Francis de Bourbon, Count of St. Pol. The two universities were finally reunited in 1565. At that point Grenoble was an important center of law practice in France, thus law practice was at the center of the university education. The French Revolution, with its focus on the end to inherited privilege, led to the suppression of most universities in France. To revolutionaries, universities embodied bastions of corporatism and established interests. Moreover, lands owned by the universities and utilized for their support represented a source of wealth and therefore were confiscated, just as property possessed by the Church. =Modern period (1800‚Äì1968)= In 1805‚Äì1808, Napoleon reestablished faculties of law, letters, and science. The Bourbon Restoration had temporarily suppressed the Faculty of Letters and the Faculty of Law, but by the 1850s the university's activity had begun rapidly developing again. The development of the sciences at the university was spearheaded by the transformation of Grenoble from a regional center to a major supplier of industrial motors and electrical equipment in 1880s. The faculties were formally inaugurated as the University of Grenoble in 1879 in the newly constructed Place de Verdun. There were around 3000 students in 1930. Significant enrollment growth in the 1960s created pressures on the academic infrastructure of the university; the library Suzanne Dobelmann helped expand facilities, especially those relating to science and medicine. =Recent history (1968‚Äìpresent)= Some of the ex-UPMF facilities Following riots among university students in May 1968, a reform of French education occurred. The Orientation Act (Loi d‚ÄôOrientation de l‚ÄôEnseignement Superieur) of 1968 divided the old faculties into smaller subject departments, decreased the power of the Ministry of National Education, and created smaller universities, with strengthened administrations. Thus, sharing the fate of all French universities in 1970s, the University of Grenoble was split into four institutions. Each university had different areas of concentration of study and the faculties were divided as follows: * Scientific and Medical University of Grenoble, which in 1987 was renamed Joseph Fourier University (UJF), for sciences, health, and technology * University of Economics and Law, which in 1987 was renamed Pierre Mend√®s-France University (UPMF), for social sciences and humanities ** Grenoble Institute of Political Studies, affiliated with UPMF and focusing on political science * University of Languages and Letters, which in 1987 was renamed Stendhal University, for arts and languages * Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble-INP) for engineering On 1 January 2016, the first three institutions reunited to restore the original common institution under the name Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. Although Grenoble-INP remains separate, it is an active member of the Community Universit√© Grenoble Alpes and cooperates very closely with the university not only in research projects, but also by sharing labs, offering mutual courses and training for students and researchers. Governance The Universit√© Grenoble Alpes is a public institution of scientific, cultural and professional relevance, which, similar to other universities in France, is governed by a board of directors and an academic council elected every four years. The president of the university is elected by the board of Directors after each renewal, and is eligible for re-election once. On 3 December 2015, staff and students from Joseph Fourier University, Pierre Mend√®s-France University, and Stendhal University voted to elect representatives to the central councils of the new university. On 7 January 2016, the Board of Directors of the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes elected Lise Dumasy as president. It was the first time a woman has been elected to head a merged university in France. The university is also a member of the Community Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, a COMUE whose current president is Patrick L√©vy. The association allows the humanities and social sciences and natural and formal sciences to be represented in the governance of the entire university system of Grenoble.

Gaucho literature, also known as gauchesco (\\"gauchoesque\\") genre was a literary movement purporting to use the language of the gauchos, comparable to the American cowboy, and reflecting their mentality. Although earlier works have been identified as gauchoesque, the movement particularly thrived from the 1870s to 1920s in Argentina, Uruguay and south of Brazil after which the movement petered out, although some works continued to be written. Gauchoesque works continue to be read and studied as a significant part of Argentine literary history.Henderson, Helene, and Jay P. Pederson, editors, Twentieth-Century Literary Movements Dictionary, Detroit: Omnigraphics Inc., 2000 The movement arose as writers in those countries developed their understanding of their national identities. Three great poets in this trend were, Jos√© Hern√°ndez, Estanislao del Campo and Hilario Ascasubi. The influence of folk music and a countrified language has always, to some extent, been felt in popular literature, as, for example, in the folk- flavoured poetry of the Uruguayan gauchoesque poet Bartolom√© Hidalgo (1788-1822); unless otherwise noted, each year in this article links to its corresponding \\"[year] in literature\\" article). And the influx on the soul which the gaucho exercises can be felt on the work of much later writers who loved the country scene of Argentina and Uruguay, such as Ricardo G√ºiraldes, Benito Lynch and Enrique Amorim. This is particularly true of even the most modern Uruguayan literature. With Mark Twain's attempt to reproduce the dialect of Missouri boys, slaves, \\"injuns\\", etc., gauchoesque literature actually aspires to use, to perpetuate what purports to be the actual language of the gauchos.

CGA-Canada established the designation's certification requirements and professional standards, offers professional development, conducts research and advocacy, and represents CGAs nationally and internationally. CGA-Canada joined the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2015. CPA Canada is the new national accounting body formed by the merger of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) and the Society of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) in 2013, and now Certified General Accountants. In October 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 CGA-Canada was named one of \\"Canada's Top 100 Employers\\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., CGA-Canada has also been named one of \\"BC's Top Employers\\" and one of \\"Canada's Greenest Employers\\". History The national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants' Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants' Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters. Auditing rights are regulated by provincial governments. In Prince Edward Island, only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act. In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies. *1948 Bilingual origins: Examinations are offered in English and French in Quebec. The move to a bilingual organization is underway. *1950s CGA-British Columbia and the University of British Columbia's School of Commerce develop an innovative five-year extension program, available on campus or by correspondence. The program is later adopted in other jurisdictions and becomes a national curriculum standard. *1964 Education program goes international: The education program is extended to the Caribbean and Bermuda. *1974 Code of Ethics enshrined: CGA-Canada approves what would become the Code of Ethical Principles and Rules of Conduct. *1977 Founding member of IFAC: CGA-Canada becomes a founding member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). *1982 Name change to the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada. *1988 John Leslie's award: The John Leslie Award is established in honour of the association's founding president and Chair, and recognizes exceptional service. *1987-1991 Competency-based accounting education: A major revision of the CGA education program is completed. Competency-based objectives, management emphasis and integration of ethics and information technology become hallmarks of the revised program. *1998 Degree required: CGAs are now required to obtain a bachelor's degree prior to certification. Partnerships are developed with universities to provide distance-learning options. *2003 Asian links secured: CGA-Hong Kong is granted affiliate status. CGA education materials are offered at more than a dozen Chinese universities. *2013 Unifying the accounting profession: CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation Chartered Professional Accountant. *2014 Unification completes in October 2014. Historically Quebec and Ontario only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions. In August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec's measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the 'Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables g√©n√©raux accr√©dit√©s du Qu√©bec' enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies. On November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario's requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario's notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility, allowing CGAs to practice anywhere in Canada. In November 2008, Dr. Catherine Boivie was appointed to the Board of Directors as the Public Representative. Based in British Columbia, Dr. Boivie is the chief executive officer of Inventure Solutions and senior vice-president of information technology (IT) and facilities at Vancity, Canada's largest credit union. In October 2013, CGA- Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation Chartered Professional Accountant. This followed most provincial CGA bodies ratifying the unification of the accounting profession in Canada. Education CGA-Canada's professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.http://www.cga.org/canada/competency The knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA. The complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.http://www.cga.org/canada A CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experiences, but in all cases they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields. Before issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year. CGA is recognized in 170+ countries through their partnership with ACCA. Online learning CGA-Canada has been providing online professional accounting education. Via the Internet, students can complete their studies using a system that integrates text material, study guides, video and audio tools, discussion forums, group case study and project work, web research and email. Introduced in 2011, Professional Experience Required for Certification (PERC) is the national reporting process for students in the CGA program. With PERC, students can document their experiences online and submit it annually. In addition to its own online program of studies, CGA-Canada has also developed online degree partnerships with several Canadian universities.CGA- Canada's website Online learning Research CGA-Canada develops research and supports positions with a view to influence social policy, regulation and standards-setting.

This agreement was renewed in 2011. In April 2008, CGA-Canada and CPA Australia entered into a MRA to extend the global reach of both organizations into new continents. In June 2009, CGA-Canada and CPA Ireland entered into a mutual recognition agreement. The MRA establishes a strategic partnership between the two leading accounting organizations and gives members the opportunity to qualify for another designation. In June 2010, CGA-Canada and the Ordre des Experts-Comptables, France's foremost accounting organization, have entered into a MRA. Under this accord, CGAs and members of the CSOEC can be considered for membership by the other body. The association is a member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). CGA-Canada is an affiliate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean and is a member of the International Federation of Francophone Accountants (FIDEF).

An anime television series based on the series was later produced, titled Sentimental Journey. Three Japanese radio dramas based on the series, titled Sentimental Night, Kaettekita Sentimental Night, and Only Sentimental Night 2 were produced. A number of non-broadcast Japanese audio dramas have also been produced. Several dojin games have been made based on the characters, including the infamous Sentimental Shooting scrolling shooter, which combines a very engaging (and difficult) shoot 'em up with provocative imagery. Its nicknames amongst fans are typically Senchi or the contraction SenchiGura. Following the 1994 hit success of Tokimeki Memorial, NEC Interchannel initiated a cooperation between Tabeta Toshio and the main staff of the Graduation series with game production house Marcus in an attempt to produce a \\"Tokimeki-like\\" game. While the six central characters were cast by Seiji Productions, the remaining six were considered unconventional for the time in that they were selected for public appeal. At the time, many of the staff and cast were unknown by the general public, which spurred a large media sales campaign designed to widen the game's exposure and establish it as a new brand. Advertisements and articles were placed in many magazines such as Dengeki G's Magazine as well as the TBS radio show Sentimental Night which aired in 1997. A unit entitled \\"SG girls\\" was formed and numerous events and concert were held. The promotion paid off, as sales of various related goods took off, the game received a positive reaction from fans, and copies became scarce. In the Sentimental Journey anime, each episode is presented like an epilogue to the game scenario, focusing on one of the girls and telling a short romantic story. The common thread among the stories is the presence of a nondescript boy (possibly not even the same boy) who used to be a childhood crush or best friend, or just a short acquaintance, before moving away. This boy would have an influence over the girl's present life. The stories range widely from straightforward girl-gets-boy romance to friendships of various sorts and sometimes supernatural events. Heroines ; :Voice actress: Urarako Suzuki :Akira met the protagonist when he walked in on her practicing the violin and encouraged her to put true feeling to her music. In the anime, she quits violin after placing second in a competition, but her piano accompanist pursues her and tries to win her back. ; :Voice actress: Asami Okamoto :Asuka wanted to date the protagonist, imagining herself to be the heroine of a popular romantic comedy film, but she fell ill on the day that they were supposed to go out and he moved away soon after.

Asuka begins to show signs of maturity until the day of the contest where she doesn't show up. Tazaki's producer colleague says that Asuka heard on the radio that the protagonist might be in town so she waits in the theater for him all day. They conclude she made the right ladylike decision. ; :Voice actress: Chizu Yonemoto :The protagonist and Chie were charged with arranging the school festival, and together they managed to make the event one of the biggest in school history, but the protagonist moved away before Chie could sing the song she had composed for him.

It turns out he wants to write love songs (something Chie has shielded herself from doing) and the woman is an agent for a record company. ; :Voice actress: Ai Maeda :Emiru was ostracized by her peers for her strange mannerisms, but the protagonist didn't mind and became friends with her. When he had to move, they made a time capsule promising each other that they would continue to be friends after they grew up. In the anime, she visits her old school which is in the process of being demolished but is soon haunted by the spirit attached to the school.

It turns out her father went out to seek advice on how to interact better with Honoka, and that the assistant was also asking help on better relationships. This leads Honoka to continue writing. She turns down the postman, who after sensing she doesn't need him anymore, disappears. ; :Voice actress: Yukiko Mannaka :Kaho is one of the best runners in her school, and had claimed crowns in every event except for the relay race.

At first she refuses but is tricked by her parents to entertain a visiting relative, who turns out to be the same guy. After he bumbles about, she agrees to help him visit a garden where she learns she still loves the art of kimono.

In the anime story, Rurika vows never to tell lies because of the incident. Six years later, Rurika is in high school and meets a girl Kazumi at the convenience store she works at. Kazumi hands her a confession letter intended for Rurika's brother. Rurika calls her up and learns Kazumi wants to go on a date with him before she goes to America for surgery. Rurika tries to accommodate her wishes by dressing up and pretending to be her twin brother, taking her on the date. She keeps the act going for most of the day until they visit an exhibit where she sees a large sculpture of the same fossil on the wall and it spooks her into dropping her wallet. Kazumi tells Rurika she had a good time even after she found out she is a girl, and that she is heading to America not because she was sick but that she wants to be a nurse. ; :Voice actress: Junko Okada :Taeko was the protagonist's neighbor when they were children (making her chronologically the first girl he met) and the two often teased by the other kids as the \\"Adachi couple\\".

Taeko invites Chigusa and Tetsuro over and tries to set up some private time, just like in typical sh≈çjo manga, but it doesn't seem to go well. Taeko encourages Chigusa to knit a sweater for Tetsuro, but Chigusa runs into some situations where Tetsuro seems to be more friendly with Taeko than her, such as catching her when she trips for a hug, and calling her by her first name. Tetsuro mentions he also has someone he's interested in and that he is also moving. Taeko assumes Tetsuro is interested in her, so she tries to resolve things only to learn that Tetsuro and Chigusa do like each other after all, and that Tetsuro is only moving neighborhoods and not leaving school. ; :Voice actress: Michiko Oda :Wakana was locked in the family warehouse as punishment for trespassing; the Protagonist, though he was chased out for this infraction as well, sneaked back in at night to be with her so she wouldn't be afraid. The two then found an old music box that played a lovely melody. In the anime story, Wakana is feeling rather glum; she has a philosophical discussion with her grandparents' friend Gengaku, a Zen Buddhist monk at Tenryu temple, on her earthly desires of falling in love, dealing with a friend's family divorce, and whether feelings of love are a good or bad thing. After Gengaku and Wakana walk around and visit the city for some snacks, Gengaku tells her a story where a guy is in love with a girl and makes promises for her but lets his best friend who simply loves her to have her. Wakana thinks that the best friend did a horrible thing but Gengaku changes her perspective, asking if that's really the case or whether the guy was selfish with his promises.

A typhoon reaches the area that night, but they stay until the eye of the storm and see meteors in that moment of time. Sentimental Graffiti 1 The first game focused on the relationship between a boy and the various girls he met throughout his life. The protagonist, Tanaka Ichirou, is a high school student who, prior to the spring vacation of his third year, receives a letter simply stating \\"I want to meet you.\\" During middle school, his frequent transferring of schools allowed him to form unique relationships with various girls. In order to search for the sender of the letter, he travels nationwide to various places, and meets the 12 girls of his memories once again. Sentimental Graffiti 2 The second game takes place in a world in which the first protagonist died in a traffic accident during his journey. The game takes place in a college town in which the original 12 girls have gathered to attend. The protagonist, Shiina Kouhei, is a second-year college student and a member of the Photography Club. He has been tasked with the job of finding his own model for the photo exhibition at the upcoming school festival, and thus turns to one of the now emotionally scarred girls in hopes of convincing them to become his model. Sentimental Graffiti 2 was received on a much smaller scale than the first one. By this time, the momentum of the series had already been lost since three years had passed since the release of the original and by this time the genre was flooded with similar games. In addition, the original scenario writer was not in charge of the second game, stating that even if he did wanted to, it was impossible for him to write such a continuation as to have the original protagonist die in such a way. Moreover, fans of the series were upset by the change in Taeko Adachi's voice actress, who was played by Arishima Moyu for the sequel.

Bishopstone is a village with a population of about 200 people, with the nearby village of Norton, located along a dead-end road west of Seaford, East Sussex (where, at the 2011 Census, the population was included), in East Sussex, England. History StAndrew's The medieval tide dial at StAndrew's, marking the canonical hours for its clerics Bishopstone was an episcopal manor, hence its name meaning \\"dwelling place of the bishop\\". The church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, is thought to date from the 8th century, and may well be the oldest in the county. Bishopstone church has an ancient canonical sundial in its porch. The sundial is inscribed with the name Eadric, the King of Kent in 685.Wall, J. Charles (1912), Porches & Fonts. Pub. Wells, Gardner, Darton & Co., Ltd., London. P. 67. It was rebuilt in 1200.

There are no shops or pubs in the village. Notable residents In the 7th century the village is believed to have been the home of a saint, Leofwynn; she was venerated locally in the Dark Ages and medieval times. The poet James Hurdis was born in the village and there is a memorial to him in the church.

Production The script was adapted by Marcy Klauber and Schwartz from the Sholem Aleichem play based on his own book. Schwartz also directed the film. The movie was based on two prior works by Schwartz from two decades before: the 1919 silent film Broken Barries (Khavah) and the 1919 stage production of Tevye.Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds by J Hobermann. New York, 1991, . p.53-54.Laughter Through Tears: The Yiddish Cinema by Judith N Goldberg. 1983. . p.97-98. The production was filmed at Biograph Studios in New York City and on a farm in Jericho, Long Island, New York. Midway through the shooting of the film, on August 23, 1939, Hitler seized Danzig and a Nazi invasion of Poland was imminent. These and other events in Europe impacted on the actors, many of whom had family in Poland. The filming was completed nevertheless.Frieden, Ken, \\"A Century in the Life of Sholem Aleichem's Tevye\\" (1993). Syracuse University. Paper 46. The story focuses primarily on the plotlines from Sholem Aleichem's stories \\"Chava\\" and \\"Lekh-Lekho (Get Thee Out)\\" but provides a definite ending rather than Sholom Aleichem's ambiguous ending. In this version of Tevya, as the Jews are expelled from their shtetl, Chava who had previously converted to Christianity to marry, leaves her husband, returns to her family and to Judaism. It is felt that the anti- Semitism of the time influenced Schwartz to provide this ending. Post- production Long thought to be a lost film, a print was discovered in 1978. The same story was the basis of the 1964 stage musical Fiddler on the Roof and its 1971 film version, though the fate of Chava in the ending was changed for the change in attitudes by that time. In 1991, Tevya was the first non-English language film to be named \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the U.S. Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

Long active in Republican politics, he is most notable for his service as the 74th Governor of Vermont from 1969 to 1973. Early life and career Deane Davis was born in East Barre, Vermont on November 7, 1900, the son of Earle Russell Davis (1867-1945) and Lois Salome Hillery (1870-1952). Earle Davis was an attorney who served as state's attorney for Washington County and county probate judge. The younger Davis attended the schools of Barre, and graduated from Spaulding High School in 1918. As Davis related in a 1978 interview, he intended to begin college after high school, but became ill during the influenza academic and did not recover until September. In searching for a university in which he could enroll after recovering, Davis sought one that had a World War I-era Student Army Training Corps program that would enable him to pay for his expenses. He discovered that the only place on the east coast that met this requirement was Boston University School of Law, which required two years of liberal arts education. The dean of the law school agreed to enroll Davis provided that he simultaneously complete the liberal arts requirements. He studied at the law school while participating in the SATC program, received his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1922, and became a lawyer in Barre.Vermont Legislative Directory, by Vermont Secretary of State, 1971, page 555Newspaper article, From Boston Bootblack to Vermont Judge, Davis' Story, Boston Globe, October 21, 1931Cyclopedia of Insurance in the United States, 1958, page 875The Blue Book: Leaders of the English-Speaking World, Thomson Gale, 1973, page 347 A Republican, Davis served in local offices including member of the City Council and City Attorney. From 1927 to 1928 he was Washington County State's Attorney.The International Who's Who, 1974-75, Europa Publications Limited, 1974, page 395 From 1931 to 1936 Davis was a Judge of the Vermont Superior Court, having been appointed to fill the vacancy created when Warner A. Graham was appointed to the Vermont Supreme Court.The Vermont Bar Journal, by Vermont Bar Association, Volume 28, 2002, page 14 As a leader of the party, Davis also attended numerous state and national conventions as a Delegate, including the 1948 Republican National Convention. In the 1930s Davis practiced law in partnership with Stanley C. Wilson, F. Ray Keyser, Sr., and J. Ward Carver. Their firm was described as Vermont's \\"best ever collection of legal talent,\\" in that it produced one Vermont Supreme Court Justice (Keyser), two Governors (Wilson and Davis), and one state Attorney General (Carver). In 1940 Davis left private practice to become General Counsel for National Life Insurance Company. From 1942 to 1943 he was president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce. In October 1942 he became president of the Vermont Bar Association, succeeding Joseph A. McNamara, and he served a one-year term. In 1943 he was appointed a Vice President of National Life. He was named President in 1950, and served as Chief Executive Officer from 1960 to 1966.

From 1969 to 1973 Davis served as governor. His governorship was out of the ordinary because he assumed office at a relatively advanced age, and because he had not served the usual \\"apprenticeship\\" of previous successful Republican nominees for governor, which typically included leadership positions in the Vermont House of Representatives or Vermont Senate, or lesser state offices such as lieutenant governor. His governorship was particularly noteworthy for the creation of a state sales tax. Davis also oversaw the 1970 enactment of Act 250, a law designed to allow for planned real estate sale and development while also safeguarding the environment, community life, and aesthetic character of the state.Davis Leads Vermont GOP Sweep of All Statewide Offices, Christian Science Monitor, November 7, 1968Newspaper article, Gov.
