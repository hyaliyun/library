Background The album was recorded over eight days and features instrumental contributions by bassist Danny Thompson and members of Fairport Convention. \\"Solid Air\\", the title track, was dedicated to a friend of Martyn's, Nick Drake, who would die of an antidepressant overdose 18 months after the album was released.\\"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\\", Robert Dimery, 2005, p.190 Martyn said of the track \\"It was done for a friend of mine, and it was done right with very clear motives, and I'm very pleased with it, for varying reasons. It has got a very simple message, but you'll have to work that one out for yourself.\\" The album features an avant-garde cover of Skip James' \\"Devil Got My Woman,\\" here retitled \\"I'd Rather Be the Devil\\" and performed with heavy use of Martyn's Echoplex tape delay effect. \\"May You Never\\" became something of a signature song for Martyn, becoming a staple of his live performances. Released in November 1971 as a single in an early form, the song was re- recorded during the Solid Air sessions. Eric Clapton covered \\"May You Never\\" on his 1977 album Slowhand. When Martyn was presented with a lifetime achievement award by Phil Collins (a collaborator of Martyn's) at the 2008 BBC Folk Awards, In 2006, Martyn performed the album live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series and subsequently toured the UK. A remastered CD was issued by Universal Records in October 2000. This CD was packaged in a card slipcase, and featured a remastered version of the original album with the addition of a live version of \\"I'd Rather Be The Devil\\". Solid Air was given a further remastering and repackaging when a double CD reissue curated by John Hillarby was released in 2009, and which included several alternate studio and live versions. The album cover is an example of schlieren photography demonstrating the 'solid' nature of air. Reception Contemporary reviews were favourable, with music weekly Sounds declaring that \\"Solid Air flows beautifully and shows the entire spectrum of music that John Martyn has at his fingertips.\\" In a retrospective review, American Songwriter described the album as \\"timeless\\" and stated that \\"audacious, hypnotic and groundbreaking only begins to describe Martyn‚Äôs still unique combination of folk, jazz, blues and space rock, wrapped around riveting, unforgettable melodies.\\" AllMusic called Solid Air \\"one of the defining moments of British folk\\" and noted its genre-blending. BBC Music stated that \\"it's a classic with not a note out of place.. And ably assisted by John Wood's late night production it's now firmly esconced in the hearts of chillers, smokers and music lovers the world over.\\" Solid Air was rated as the 67th Greatest British Album Ever by the British music magazine Q, and was also included in their list of Best Chill-Out Albums Of All Time. The album is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die by Robert Dimery. It was voted number 826 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).

It is named in honor of English scientist Charles Darwin. With no dry landing sites, Darwin Island's main attractions are found in the Pacific Ocean, which is teeming with a large variety of marine life. Although the island had been marked on maps and had initially been given the name Culpepper Island on Admiralty charts, the first landing on Darwin Island was not until 1964, by helicopter.Ecuador & the Gal√°pagos Islands, by Danny Palmerlee, Michael Grosberg, Carolyn McCarthy. The small detached group formed by Darwin Island and Wolf Island is sometimes referred to as Darwin and Wolf or Darwin-Wolf, formerly Culpepper and Wenman. Geology Darwin Island is the remains of an extinct volcano that reaches above sea level. It is situated northwest of the main Gal√°pagos Island group on the Wolf-Darwin Lineament, which extends from the Gal√°pagos Platform to the Gal√°pagos Spreading Center, a mid-ocean ridge separating the Nazca and Cocos tectonic plates. The formation of Darwin Island is different from the formation of the main Gal√°pagos Islands. There are currently two theories on the formation of the lineament: the first is that magma rising from the mantle plume forming the main Gal√°pagos Islands has been channelled towards the Gal√°pagos Spreading Center; alternatively there has been a separate rise in magma caused by stress in the ocean lithosphere by a transform fault.Blair et al., Plume Ridge Interaction Darwin Island is the most northerly of the two peaks on the Wolf Darwin Lineament that reach above the surface. The other, Wolf Island, is approximately away, although there are other sub-surface peaks. The volcano that forms the island is extinct, with the last eruption believed to have been approximately 400,000 years ago,Cornell University making it younger than Wolf. The lava flows around Darwin are homogenous, apparently because of its young age, and they have a similar chemical composition to those of the Gal√°pagos Spreading Center.Role of Plume-Ridge Interaction in Magma Genesis III: Darwin Island Darwin is believed to have had at least two eruptive periods in its history, depositing two tuff layers separated by plagioclase ultraphyric basalt. Evidence also exists to suggest that Darwin Island is the remains of what was once a much larger edifice. Since the eruptive phase this would have been eroded. Darwin's Arch, a natural rock arch which would at one time have been part of this larger structure, is located less than a kilometre from the main Darwin Island, and is a landmark well known to the island's few visitors. Wildlife Darwin Island is not open to land visits. As a result, the only visitors are those that come to scuba dive, even here due to the distance from the main island only a limited number of liveaboard ships cruise here. The marine life at Darwin is diverse with large schools of fish. The island's waters attract whale sharks from June to November, as well as hammerhead, Gal√°pagos, silky and blacktip sharks. In addition green turtles, manta rays and dolphins can be found. The island also supports a large bird population, including frigatebirds, red-footed boobies and the vampire finch.

Harwood is also part of the historic county of Lancashire. History The township was recorded as Harewode in 1212 and 1302. The manor which included Bradshaw, was part of the Manchester fee held by the Grelleys in the Middle Ages. In 1212 it was divided, the parts held by Roger de Samlesbury and Alexander de Harwood. The Samlesbury portion descended in the same way as Breightmet and the Harwood portion to the Traffords of Trafford who sold it in 1589 and afterwards much divided. The Radcliffes and Bartons of Smithills Hall held land in Harwood for many generations and Adam Mort of Astley held a messuage and a fulling mill in 1630. In 1612, Sir Nicholas Mosley and his son, Edward, conveyed the manor of Harwood to a partnership of five yeomen; Matthew Harrison, Henry Haworth, Raufe Higson, Lawrence Horrocks and Edward Greenhalgh. In the Hearth tax returns of 1666, forty-two hearths were liable to tax but only one house had three hearths. The common lands were enclosed in 1801. Christ Church was built in 1840 and Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels were also built. Governance Lying within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Harwood was a township in the ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors in the Hundred of Salford. In 1837 it became part of the Bolton Poor Law Union which took responsibility for funding the Poor Law in that area and in 1898 it became part of Turton Urban District. Geography Harwood is 2¬Ω miles north east of Bolton in the West Pennine Moors to the north of the road to Bury. Bradshaw Brook separates it from Tonge. The township covered about of hilly land, the highest point is at Bowstone Hill and the lowest . Stone was quarried and the brooks used by bleachworks. The underlying rocks are coal measures, sandstones and shales. Originally a small village within the former Turton Urban District, but now a small part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton. Harwood is mostly residential, with the few businesses concentrated around a Morrisons supermarket at its centre. Neighbouring districts include Affetside, Bradshaw and Breightmet. Harwood has several public houses; (the House Without a Name, the Seven Stars, the Grey Mare, the Old School House and the White Horse) two restaurants, a doctors' surgery and a cruising park (Longsight Park, though there is a small recreational ground for children off Recreation Street). Transport Harwood is served by the 507 bus from Bolton. On Monday to Saturday weekdays, the 480 runs hourly running between Bolton and Bury, via Bradshaw, Harwood, Affetside and Tottington. The nearest railway stations are located at Hall i' th' Wood within walking distance on the main road and Bromley Cross within the public footpaths in Bradshaw. Education Primary schools in the area are St Brendan's, St Maxentius, Harwood Meadows, Hardy Mill and the now-closed Longsight and Christ's Church. The popular secondary school for residents of Harwood is Turton High School in Bromley Cross, though both Canon Slade and Bolton St Catherine's Academy are nearby.

It is larger than the mandola, but smaller than the mandocello and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians. Terminology The names of the mandolin family instruments vary between Europe and the United States.\\"The Mandolin Family\\", The Acoustic Music Co., UK The instruments that are known in the US as the mandola and the octave mandolin tend to be known in Great Britain and Ireland as the tenor mandola, the octave mandola (or the \\"Irish bouzouki\\"). Also, octave mandola is sometimes applied to what in the U.S. is a mandocello. In Europe outside the British isles, mandola is the larger GDAE tuned instrument while the smaller CGDA tuned one is known as alt-mandoline (i.e., alto mandolin), mandoliola or liola. This geographic distinction is not crisp, and there are cases of each term being used in each country. Jimmy Moon, a Scottish luthier calls his version of the instrument by both names and Paul Shippey, an English luthier, uses the term octave mandolin. Confusion will likely continue as the terms continue to be used interchangeably. Construction =Mandolin body= Octave mandolin construction is similar to the mandolin: the body may be constructed with a bowl-shaped back according to designs of the 18th-century Vinaccia school, or with a flat (arched) back according to the designs of Gibson Guitar Corporation popularized in the United States in the early 20th century. The scale of the octave mandolin is longer than that of the mandolin, and varies more widely, from 19\\" (48.4 cm) to 24\\" (61.0 cm), with 21\\" (53.3 cm) being typical. The internal bracing is similar to the mandolin and mandola, with a single transverse brace on the top just below the oval soundhole. On modern instruments X-bracing is sometimes used. As is typical of the mandolin family, octave mandolins can be found with either a single oval soundhole or a pair of \\"F\\" soundholes. As with the scale length, the number of frets on an octave mandolin also varies widely, from as few as 17 to as many as 24 frets: 18 or 19 frets is typical. =Guitar body= From the mid-20th century on, a number of makers have produced octave mandolins with guitar-shaped (e.g., the \\"hourglass\\" or \\"figure-8\\") bodies. These instruments are typically constructed essentially like acoustic guitars, with similar woods and internal bracing. the neck, however, is much narrower, and supports the mandolin string layout, rather than the traditional 6-strings of the guitar. =Layout of strings= As with the mandolin and mandola, the octave mandolin has four courses of two strings each. The two strings in each course are tuned in unison. Alternate tunings exist in which the strings in some courses are tuned to octaves, rather than unisons, but this is more typical of the Irish Bouzouki. Tuning and range Usually, courses of 2 adjacent strings are doubled (tuned to the same pitch). The standard octave mandolin tuning is G2 G2 ‚Ä¢ D3 D3 ‚Ä¢ A3 A3 ‚Ä¢ E4 E4, so the lowest open strings are tuned to the lowest 'G' on the guitar, and the highest strings are tuned to the same 'E' as the highest string of the guitar. This tuning is one octave below the mandolin (or a fourth below the mandola), and is equivalent to that of the tenor violin: * fourth (lowest tone) course: G2 ( Hz) * third course: D3 ( Hz) * second course: A3 ( Hz) * first (highest tone) course: E4 ( Hz) The average range, therefore, is about three-and-a-half octaves, with the exact range depending on the number of frets on the individual instrument: from about one and one-third octaves below middle C up to A#5/Bb5, in the octave above middle C, (with 18 frets), to as high as E6, with 24 frets. Usage Octave mandolins are sometimes used in mandolin orchestras in place of mandolas.The Franco-American Mandolin Festival, Program notes, 2007 The mandolinists thus avoid learning to read music on the alto clef; music for the octave mandolin is usually written on the more familiar treble clef, and plays an octave lower than the notes shown (see octave clefs).

They patronized a number of major figures in the arts community including Gioacchino Rossini, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Honor√© de Balzac, Eug√®ne Delacroix, and Heinrich Heine. Chopin had become Charlotte's piano teacher in 1841, and as a tacit acknowledgment of the many years of support extended by Baron James and his wife Betty, dedicated to her (almost certainly as an 1843 wedding present) his celebrated Ballade No. 4 in F minor, Op. 52, and four years later another work, his Waltz in C-sharp minor, Op. 64, No. 2.  Married Life  In 1842, Charlotte married her English-born cousin Nathaniel de Rothschild (1812‚Äì1870) and in 1850 they moved to Paris, where he went to work at her father's bank, de Rothschild Fr√®res. They were the parents of: * Nathalie de Rothschild (1843‚Äì1843) * Nathan James Eduard de Rothschild (1844‚Äì1881) * Mayer Albert de Rothschild (1846‚Äì1850) * Arthur de Rothschild (1851‚Äì1903) While Charlotte de Rothschild and her husband would always live in Paris, in 1853 they purchased the Ch√¢teau Brane-Mouton vineyard that they renamed Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild. In 1878, Charlotte bought the Abbaye des Vaux de Cernay in Cernay-la-Ville in the Vall√©e de Chevreuse, at the time only a ruins of a Cistercian abbey built in 1118. She undertook extensive restoration work and new construction to make the lakeside property into a country home. The property remained in family hands until 1945 when it was by sold by her grandson Henri James de Rothschild to aircraft manufacturer F√©lix Amiot. Abbaye des Vaux de Cernay in Cernay-la- Ville in the Vall√©e de Chevreuse bought by Baroness Charlotte de Rothschild Like her father, Charlotte de Rothschild was a collector of art and grew up around his artistic friends. As an adult, Charlotte would count amongst her friends the likes of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Henri Rousseau, and √âdouard Manet. Her art purchases included works by Henri Fantin-Latour, Louis-L√©opold Boilly, Anthony van Dyck plus a number by Rococo painters Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Fran√ßois Boucher. However, Charlotte de Rothschild's interest in art went beyond collecting. Talented in her own right, she studied with N√©lie Jacquemart (1841‚Äì1912) and would earn respect for her landscape paintings, watercolors and engravings, enough so that she is recognized in the Benezit Dictionary of Artists. She exhibited in 1872 at the Paris Salon as well as at an 1879 exhibition in London, and from 1879 showed work at the annual salon of the Soci√©t√© des aquarellistes fran√ßais.[s.n.] (1879). Soci√©t√© d'aquarellistes fran√ßais: Premi√®re exposition; rue Laffitte, 16: Catalogue (in French). Paris: Imprimerie de D. Jouaust. Although a minor artist, her work has been on display at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg in Paris and other museums around France. Her illuminated Haggadah of Pesach is in the Braginsky Collection.Adding the Personal to the Purely Sacred, Edward Rothstein, June 25, 2010, New York Times. Charlotte de Rothschild's interest extended to music, entertaining musician friends such as Georges Bizet and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. Charlotte de Rothschild's lifetime of involvement in art and music would greatly influence her offspring, producing writers, actors and playwrights.  Later Years  Tragedy struck her family in 1881 when she lost her eldest surviving child, thirty-seven-year-old James-Edouard. An attorney in the Rothschild bank in Paris, James-Edouard de Rothschild had served in the Garde Mobile during the Franco-Prussian War and suffered from a number of illnesses, including depression that led to his suicide.

Born in Balochistan, Afghanistan, she lived the final 25 years of her life in Pune, India. She is most notable as the original master of Meher Baba, an Irani Indian spiritual master. Early life and realization The earliest recorded account of Hazrat Babajan, who was named at birth Gulrukh (\\"Face like a Rose\\") states that she \\"is the daughter of one of the ministers of the Amir of Afghanistan\\".Purdom, Charles B: The Perfect Master, London: Williams & Northgate, 1937, p. 115, and referring to Meher Baba‚Äôs 1927 public discourse on Babajan, which had been recorded in a diary at the time Later accounts report that Babajan \\"hails from Afghanistan ‚Ä¶ and was the daughter of a well- to-do Afghan of noble lineage\\";Munsiff, Dr Abdul Ghani: \\"Hazrat Babajan of Poona\\", Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, February 1939, No. 4, p. 31 \\"born to a royal Muslim family of Baluchistan.\\"Kalchuri, Bhau: Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age Volume One, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: Manifestation, Inc., 1986, p. 5Regarding Babajan‚Äôs early life, Ghani says, \\"the information gleaned from different sources is meagre, since Babajan herself was never communicative to anyone with regard to her early life\\" (Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 31). Another version of Babajan‚Äôs early life says: \\"According to some people [her] original name is Razia Sultana. She is said to be the daughter of one Bahadur Shah Zaffar and had come from Afghanistan\\" (Burman, J J Roy: Hindu-Muslim Syncretic Shrines and Communities, New Delhi: Mittal Publications, 2002, p. 237) The precise date of Babajan‚Äôs birth is unclear. Biography variants range from 1790Purdom, Charles B: The God-Man: The Life, Journeys & Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence & Spiritual Teaching, London: George Allen & Unwin, 1962, p. 18, who wrote, \\"her actual date of birth is not known; it is supposed to have been about 1790.\\" Kalchuri states Babajan to have been born \\"between 1790 and 1800\\" (Meher Prabhu: Vol One, p. 5), and Ghani considered the date to have been 1806, estimating she was \\"125 years\\" when she died (Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 38) to c. 1820.Paul Brunton (Raphael Hirsch, or Hurst), quoting \\"former Judge Khandalawalla\\" in 1930, wrote: \\"her age is really about ninety-five\\", providing a later birth date of around 1835 (A Search in Secret India, London: Rider & Co., 1934, p. 62) Her education was in keeping with her family's social status of that time. Well-educated, she was fluent in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, in addition to her native Pashtu. She was also a hƒÅfi≈ºah, one who learns the Quran by heart. An introspective child and spiritually inclined, from \\"early life she developed mystical tendencies, and unlike girls of her age, she used to pass a good deal of her time in prayers, meditation and solitude.\\"Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 31 Following the conventions of Afghan nobility, Babajan was reared under the strict purdah tradition, in which women were secluded from the outside world, and also subject to a custom of arranged marriages. She opposed an unwelcome marriage planned for her, and ran away from home on her wedding day at the age of eighteen. Disguised in her burqa, she journeyed to Peshawar, the frontier city at the foot of the Khyber Pass. It was in or near Peshawar that she eventually came into contact with a Hindu sadguru. Following instruction from the guru, \\"she went into seclusion in a nearby mountain outside Rawalpindi and underwent very severe [riyazat] (spiritual austerities) for nearly seventeen months.Kalchuri confirms, \\"Under this Sadguru‚Äôs guidance she climbed a mountain in the wilderness and lived in a secluded cave. For a year and a half she remained in the mountainous regions of what is now Pakistan, undergoing rigorous spiritual austerity\\" (Meher Prabhu: Vol One, p. 7) Thereafter she came down to [the] Punjab and stayed a few months in Multan. It was in Multan, while [Babajan] was 37 years of age, she contacted a Muslim saint ‚Ä¶ who put end to her spiritual struggle by giving her God-realisation.\\"Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vo. 1, No. 4, p. 32. Ghani does not name the Muslim saint, but Kalchuri states he was known as Maula Shah. This intense spiritual experience does not appear to have been an ultimate achievement. According to Meher Baba, she \\"became God Realized at the age of about sixty-five\\" at the hands of another (unnamed) Master. Purdom confirms this earliest version: \\"After years in search of God she found a Master, who many years afterwards (at the age of sixty-five, it is said) made her perfect\\" (The God-Man, p. 18) After that experience she returned to Rawalpindi to reconnect with the Hindu guru who, after several years, helped her return to normal consciousness.Tradition attributes Shaykh Abu Sa‚Äôid Ahamd al-Kharraz of Baghdad (d. 899) as \\"the first Sufi to explain and elaborate the theories of ‚Äò'fana, or the soul‚Äôs annihilation in God, and ‚Äò'baqa, or the soul‚Äôs subsistence in God. According to this school of thought, soul‚Äôs annihilation means the mystic‚Äôs obliteration from every kind of knowledge of his phenomenal existence and individual qualities. Subsistence of the soul denotes knowledge of eternal existence and the seeker‚Äôs abiding in God\\" (see Bhatnagar, R S: Dimensions of Classical Sufi Thought, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Pvt. Ltd., 1992, pp. 186‚Äì187); see also Meher Baba, God Speaks: The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose, Walnut Creek, CA: Sufism Reoriented, 1973, pp. 131ff., pp. 240‚Äì241, who clearly recognized that there are various stages in the fana-baqa process, and who provided a comprehensive description of the stages involved, not to be found in more traditional accounts. Travels and pilgrimages After a second stay in Rawalpindi with her earlier Hindu master, Babajan embarked on several long journeys through the Middle Eastern countries Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. \\"It is said that she traveled to Mecca disguised as a man [apparently to avoid detection] by way of Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey and doubling back into Arabia.\\" At the Kaaba, she offered salat (prayers) five times a day, always sitting at one selected spot. While in Mecca, Babajan often gathered food for the poor and personally nursed pilgrims who had fallen ill.Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, p. 8 From Mecca, Babajan made pilgrimage to the tomb of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Medina, where she adopted the same routine of offering prayers and caring for fellow pilgrims. Leaving Arabia, she passed through Baghdad, Iraq and back to the Punjab. She then traveled south to Nasik and established herself in Panchavati. From Nasik, Babajan travelled to Bombay, where she stayed for some time and her fame grew. In April 1903, she made a second pilgrimage to Mecca, this time sailing from Bombay on the SS Hyderi. About 1904, Babajan returned to Bombay and soon afterward proceeded to Ajmer in northern India to pay homage at the tomb of the Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti who established the Chishti Order of Islam in India. From Ajmer she again returned to Bombay and then soon after traveled west to Pune.Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, pp. 8‚Äì11 Residence in Pune Babajan under her neem tree in Char Bavadi, Poona By 1905 Babajan arrived in Pune, where she established her final residence. Now an old woman, her back slightly bent, shoulders rounded, with white matted hair, and shabbily dressed, she \\"was seen sitting or resting at odd places, in different parts of the City.\\"Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 33 Babajan finally located to a slum area called Char Bawdi (Four Wells) on Malcolm Tank Road, part of a British Army cantonment.Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, p. 12 The Char Bawdi area at that time has been described as \\"a picture of dirt, desolation and ugliness, a breeding spot of plague and pestilence and a regular haunt of dangerous riff- raffs by night.\\"Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vo.1, No. 4, p. 33; see also Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, p. 12, who states \\"‚Ä¶ there was just a dirt road infested with hordes of mosquitoes; plague germs were even suspected there. During the day the area was desolate and deserted, but at night it sprang to life with thieves and the city‚Äôs most dangerous criminals who met there.\\" After several months‚Äô exposure to the natural elements, Babajan grudgingly allowed her devotees to build a basic shelter of gunny sacks above her. Children were in the habit of throwing stones at her.Purdom, The God-Man, p. 19, who relates: \\"I have met people who in their childhood used to throw stones at her, thinking her to be mad.\\" She was a homeless faqir; she knew how they lived. The gifts from her devotees were shared among the poor and destitute, and in some instances stolen from her by thieves.\\"She maintained a habit of sharing her meals with the needy. Devotees would frequently gift her with clothing and other items, but these she would share with the poor ‚Ä¶ not content with this charity, however, some would even dare to steal gifts from her\\" (See Helminski, Camille Adams: Women of Sufism: A Hidden Treasure, Boston: Shambhala Publications, Inc., 2003, p. 81) She remained indifferent to the material offerings or the loss. Gradually, out of devotion, or mere curiosity, increasing numbers of people from Pune and elsewhere sought her out. Several alleged miracles have been attributed to Babajan. According to one observer, within a decade of Babajan taking residence \\"the [Char Bawdi] locality underwent a metamorphosis surpassing all expectations. What with the featural changes in the buildings all around, electrified tea-shops ringing with the clatter of cups and saucers, a concourse of peoples consisting of all ranks and creeds waiting for Babajan‚Äôs darshana, a street bard entertaining the crowd with his music, the beggars clamouring for alms, easy-going idlers standing indiscriminately hampering vehicular traffic and the whole atmosphere heavily laden with sweet burning incense perpetually kept burning near Babajan, presented a scene typically Eastern, leaving an indelible impression on one‚Äôs memory.\\"Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 34  Master to Meher Baba  In May 1913, Merwan Sheriar Irani, then nineteen years old, was riding his bicycle on the way to class at Deccan College, when he looked up and saw an old woman sitting under a neem tree surrounded by a crowd. He had cycled past on previous occasions but had never paid much attention to her, though he was aware that she was regarded by some as a Muslim saint; yet others thought her \\"a mad woman or a witch or sorceress.\\"Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, p. 195 His father, Sheriar Irani, held Babajan in high regard.Shepherd, Kevin R.D. From Oppression to Freedom: A Study of the Kaivani Gnostics, Cambridge: Anthropographia Publications, 1988, p. 71 Born into a Zoroastrian family, Sheriar Irani had been an itinerant dervish for a number of yearsKalchuri, Bhau, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, pp. 117‚Äì131; before finally settling in Pune and marrying. Babajan beckoned Merwan, who in turn was drawn towards her. For several months thereafter Merwan Irani would visit the saint; they would sit together yet seldom spoke. One night during January 1914, he was about to leave, and before doing so kissed Babajan‚Äôs hands, and she in turn held his face in her hands. She then kissed him on the forehead,Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, p. 197 during which he received her spiritual grace (barakah).\\"Many have testified that the love emanating from Babajan was so intense that visitors felt pained at leaving her presence, departure involving the sensation of a powerful ‚Ä¶ current being suddenly switched off\\" (Helminski, Women of Sufism, p. 81) The event subsequently left Merwan Irani in an enraptured state in which he remained abstracted from his normal surroundings for nearly nine months.According to Purdom, when Merwan Irani left Babajan he returned home and went to bed. \\"In ten minutes he began to experience extraordinary thrills, as though he were receiving electric shocks; joy mingled with pain, and he lost his body consciousness.\\" On the fourth day he \\"was slightly conscious of his body. So he remained for nearly nine months ‚Ä¶ totally unconscious of the world\\" (The God-Man, p. 20). Kalchuri‚Äôs version adds: Merwan Irani experienced a \\"total loss of his personal identity ‚Ä¶ He found himself to be the Infinite Self ‚Äì the Ocean of God\\" (Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, p. 199) The young man would later become known as Meher Baba. Final years In 1930, several months before Babajan died, then journalist Paul Brunton visited her. He wrote, \\"She lies, in full view of passers-by, upon a low divan. . . Her head is propped by pillows. The lustrous whiteness of her silky hair offers sad contrast to the heavily wrinkled face and seamed brow.\\"Brunton, A Search in Secret India, p. 63 The meeting was brief. Yet Brunton was clearly emotionally affected, and afterwards, in his hotel room, he reflected: \\"That some deep psychological attainment really resides in the depths of her being, I am certain.\\"Brunton, A Search in Secret India, p. 64 On 18 September 1931, one of Babajan‚Äôs fingers was operated on at Sassoon Hospital, but afterwards she did not appear to be recovering.Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, p. 19 According to one version, a few days before she died, Babajan muttered, \\"It is time ‚Ä¶ time for me to leave now. The work is over ‚Ä¶ I must close the shop.\\" One of the devotees pleaded, \\"Do not say such things Babajan, we need you with us.\\" But she cryptically replied, \\"Nobody, nobody wants my wares. Nobody can afford the price. I have turned my goods over to the Proprietor.\\"  Shrine in Pune  Babajaan Shrine at Camp, Pune Hazrat Babajan died in the Char Bawdi section of Pune on 21 September 1931. On Wednesday, 23 September, The Evening News of India reported her death. The newspaper article informed that the \\"Muslim community in [Pune] has been greatly moved by the death of the famous saint‚Ä¶. Her funeral yesterday ‚Ä¶ was very largely attended with thousands of people both Muslims and Hindus taking part in the procession.\\"Reproduced in Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. Four, pp. 1426‚Äì7; see also Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 38, who observed: \\"Her funeral procession was a tremendous affair, never accorded to any dignitary or royalty in the annals of [Pune].\\" The white marble dargah (shrine) of Babajan was built alongside the neem tree under which she had sat for so many years, by the roadside which is now a busy thoroughfare. \\"It is a small one roomed dargah with the turbat [grave] placed under a tree. The trunk of the tree emerges through the rooftop.\\"See Burman, Hindu-Muslim Syncretic Shrines and Communities, p. 237. Only the stump of the tree now remains. Her dargah is frequented by people of all religions. Biographical discrepancies There are a few discrepancies to be found in the current biographies of Hazrat Babajan which require due mention. Firstly, much of the accepted information about Babajan appears to have been established solely on the authority of Meher Baba, a fact acknowledged by Dr Abdul Ghani Munsiff, who in 1939 wrote the first life-sketch of Babajan. According to Ghani, \\"the information gleaned from different sources is meagre, since Babajan herself was never communicative to anyone with regard to her life history. The facts of her early life and those relating to her spiritual career have all been confirmed by Hazrat Meher Baba, her chief disciple and spiritual Chargeman (Khalifa)\\". Yet Meher Baba appears to have provided/endorsed two different versions of Babajan‚Äôs life. =Earliest records= Over a decade before Dr Ghani‚Äôs life-sketch of Babajan appeared, in 1927 Meher Baba gave a public talk on Babajan, which a devotee had recorded in a diary at that time. This is currently the earliest account of Babajan‚Äôs life. The people being addressed were predominantly women, and the story was told to provide a moral. To summarize the essentials of that brief talk: Hazrat Babajan is the daughter of one of the then responsible and chief ministers of the Amir of Afghanistan at Kabul. From early childhood she had a natural inclination toward spirituality and the realization of Truth. When Babajan was fifteen years of age her guardians began to arrange for her marriage ‚Ä¶ at this juncture she made bold to leave the family home. For fifty years thereafter she led a life of complete resignation and renunciation. After wandering from place to place for fifty long years she at last came across her Master, and became God-Realized at the age of about sixty-five. After being God-Realized Babajan lived for some time ‚Ä¶ in the Punjab. During this stay many people began to respect her as a saint. Her occasional remarks, declaring herself to be God [Ana'l-Haqq, I am the Truth] upset the Muslim population, and fanatical Muslim Baluchi soldiers (sepoys) of a local military regiment buried Babajan alive. After a lapse of many years, during the First World War the Baluchi regiment was transferred to Pune, and in that city the same soldiers came face-to-face with Babajan sitting under her neem tree at Char Bawdi. Fanaticism was transformed into devotion, and as long as the regiment remained stationed at Pune, the soldiers came to pay their respects to Babajan. Ghani‚Äôs later, and extended, version of Babajan‚Äôs life, published in 1939, provides a different account: She left home at the age of eighteen on her wedding day. Eventually came into contact with a Hindu sadguru at Rawalpindi. Later went down to the Punjab, and when she was thirty-seven met a Muslim saint in Multan who gave her God- Realization. After the Baluchi soldiers encountered her again in Pune, \\"her saintly fame spread far and wide, and she came to be universally known as Hazrat Babajan\\".Ghani, Meher Baba Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 31‚Äì33 =Babajan‚Äôs age= Babajan‚Äôs alleged age when she died continues to be a controversial issue. Biography variants for her date of birth range from 1790 to c. 1820. The earliest birth dates are provided by Charles B Purdom and Bhau Kalchuri. Purdom was merely reporting the opinion of devotees, and so he qualified what he wrote: \\"her actual date of birth is not known; it is supposed to have been about 1790\\".Purdom, The God-Man, p. 18 Kalchuri is more dogmatic, and states Babajan was born \\"between 1790 and 1800\\", and her \\"physical presence on earth lasted between 130 to 141 years\\". Kalchuri, Meher Prabhu: Vol. One, pp. 5, 19 At the other end of the scale, in his colourful spiritual travel book, A Search in Secret India (1934), the then freelance journalist, Paul Brunton, recounts that he learnt \\"from former Judge Khandalawalla, who had known [Hazrat Babajan] for fifty years, that her age is really about ninety-five\\".Brunton, A Search in Secret India, p. 62 Brunton had arrived in India, November 1930, and had left several months before Babajan‚Äôs death in September 1931.Shepherd, Kevin R D: Meher Baba, an Iranian Liberal, Cambridge: Anthropographia Publications, 1988, pp. 146‚Äì176 Regarding Brunton‚Äôs report, Kevin R D Shepherd observed: \\"That Khandalawalla had known Babajan for as long as fifty years is questionable; though it need not be doubted that he had encountered her by the time of her second visit to Bombay c. 1900\\".Shepherd, Kevin R D: A Sufi Matriarch: Hazrat Babajan, Cambridge: Anthropographia Publications, 1986, n. 51, p. 77 Shepherd concluded, \\"The general computation of her age was about 120 years, though some maintained that it was in excess of this. Purdom cited an approximate date of 1790 for her birth, though Ghani was of the view that she was born later than this. Ghani‚Äôs estimate of her age was 125, based on general reminiscences and his own contact with her. In deference to critical tendencies which find the higher estimates indigestible, there seems every ground to believe that the subject was over a hundred by the time of her death\\".Shepherd, Kevin R D: A Sufi Matriarch: Hazrat Babajan, Cambridge: Anthropographia Publications, 1986, n. 54, pp. 77‚Äì78 References Further reading * Brunton, Paul: A Search in Secret India, first published in 1934 by Rider & Co, London.

In 2014 it was amalgamated with the National Consumer Agency to form the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. Purpose and powers Consumers were at the core of the Competition Authority's work. Its aim was to make sure that competition worked for the benefit of all consumers who bought products and services in Ireland. This included businesses, the State and its agents, as well as individuals. It had the power to investigate if there was evidence that businesses were involved in anti-competitive practices, such as price-fixing, or that businesses were abusing a dominant position. It could also block mergers between businesses that would substantially reduce competition and harm consumers. The Authority also had a very broad role to promote competition in the economy. They did this by calling for reform when Irish laws, regulations or actions by State bodies restrict competition. They advised Government and its agents on how proposed legislation or regulations could affect competition. This prevented future problems for consumers. This helped to give a voice to consumers when it came to public policy-making. They also promoted competition by telling public authorities and the public about the benefits of competition. Operations The Authority operated under the Competition Act 2002 and was funded via a grant from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The authority was divided into six divisions: Cartels, Monopolies, Advocacy, Mergers, Strategy and Corporate Services. The Authority was a collegiate body, consisting of four full-time members, who each headed one or more divisions, appointed following an open competition by the Public Appointments Service. The former Members of the Authority were Chairperson Isolde Goggin and Members Stephen Calkins, Gerald FitzGerald and Patrick Kenny. Amalgamation In November 2008, the Government announced the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency as part of a rationalisation of State agencies. On 31 March 2014 the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill was published. On 31 July Richard Bruton, TD, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation announced that the legislation would commence and the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission would be established on 31 October 2014. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer law. Both organisations continued to perform their statutory functions until the merger was given effect on 31 October 2014. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is currently governed by an executive Chair and Membership structure. The Competition and Consumer Protection Act, 2014 allows for a Chair and between two and six Members. The former Chair of the Competition Authority, Isolde Goggin, was appointed Chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on taking up her former role in 2011. Ms Goggin is supported in her role by the Members of the new Commission which include the two former Members of the Competition Authority, Fergal O'Leary and Patrick Kenny, and the former Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency, Karen O'Leary, all of whom were appointed Members-designate of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation upon taking up their current positions.

S. Louch, 'Wrenfordsley, Sir Henry Thomas (1825 - 1908)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp 440-441. Retrieved 24 March 2010 Early life Wrenfordsley was born in Middlesex, England, the son of Joseph Wrenfordsley (also known as Wrendfordsley, Wransfordsley and Wrenford Sly), an Irish solicitor, and his wife Louisa, n√©e Bywater. Educated privately in France, he entered Trinity College, Dublin (as Henry Wransfordsly) in March 1841 but did not obtain a degree. Wrenfordsley qualified as a solicitor, became a journeyman lawyer in Dublin and at the English Bar, called to the bar on 30 April 1863, he was junior counsel for the Privy Council office in House of Commons inquiries into the foreign cattle market. In 1876 Wrenfordsley became a deputy-judge of County courts at Marylebone, Brompton and Brentford. Career Wrenfordsley later joined the colonial service and was appointed as a puisne judge at Mauritius in 1877. Wrenfordsley was then appointed Attorney General of Jamaica, then on the death of Sir Archibald Burt in 1879, was made chief justice of Western Australia. He arrived there in the Bangalore on 5 March 1880 accompanied by a lady, probably his sister. Contemporary accounts suggest Wrenfordsley was given to frequent clashes of personality. One such clash with the Chief Secretary, Lord Gifford, in which he was supported by the Governor, Sir William Robinson led to Sir Henry's removal to the post of Chief Justice of Fiji. This ended a tumultuous three years for the state, although Sir Henry would return once more in 1890 as acting Chief Justice when his successor, Sir Alexander Onslow took a one- year leave of absence. Wrenfordsley was acting governor of Western Australia from February to June 1883 when he was knighted. From March 1885 to February 1887 Wrenfordsley was an acting judge of the supreme court of Tasmania, and took a similar position at Melbourne in 1888. In 1891 he was appointed temporary acting chief justice at Perth. Later in 1891 Wrenfordsley became chief justice of the Leeward Islands, and held the position until he retired in 1901 when he went to live in the south of France. Wrenfordsley died at Antibes, France on 2 June 1908, he did not marry. See also * Judiciary of Australia References * Bennett, J.

It is an elaborate wedding ensemble comprising a kurta (tunic), chooridaar (extra-long slim pants that gather at the ankles), and a 6-yard dupatta (stole or veil). History Early in the 17th century, Turkish and Persian craftsmen were invited to India by Mughal Empress Noor Jehan to craft a noble dress, that became particular only for family members of Mughal noble ladies. The art of dupatta crafting remains particular to Mughal descendants. Later, when Mughal governor Nizam-ul-Mulk declared his autonomy over Hyderabad Deccan Suba, the begums of Nizam's family modified the creative style of Mughals to form Khara Dupatta. Which was later practiced by general residents of Hyderabad. The montage gallery at Chowmahalla Palace exhibits the lifestyle royal dresses of Nizams Begums which includes Kara Dupatta. The ensemble Sometimes the kurta is worn with a long, lightweight sleeveless overcoat or a shorter koti, a bolero-like waistcoat. The brides wear a matching ghoonghat (veil) over the head.

Created by writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli, the character first appeared in Daredevil #232 (July 1986). Nuke's most distinguishing feature is an American Flag tattooed on his face. A version of the character appeared on the Marvel Cinematic Universe Netflix TV series Jessica Jones played by Wil Traval. Publication history Nuke's first appearance, Daredevil #232 (Jul. 1986). Art by David Mazzucchelli Nuke was created by Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli. He first appeared in Daredevil #232. Nuke largely disappeared following his apparent death in Daredevil #233, although his origin was explored and touched upon in issues of Captain America and Wolverine. It was not until Grant Morrison's New X-Men, when it's revealed Nuke was involved in the Weapon Plus program, that the character made a return in subsequent stories. Fictional character biography Frank Simpson was a test subject of the Weapon Plus program, the supersoldier program that had created Captain America and would later have their Weapon X facility transform Wolverine into a killing machine. The enhancing and conditioning process went awry, leaving Nuke seriously deranged. =Early life= The origins of Nuke are explained in Wolverine: Origins. The disturbed son of a wealthy, abusive, alcoholic, upper-class woman in Ohio, Frank soon developed an unhealthy affection for his babysitter, the only real maternal figure in his life. The young woman, who was harboring feelings for his father Charles Simpson, capitalized on Frank's affection and talked the boy into killing his mother. Wolverine, at that time an operative for Weapon Plus, had been sent to kidnap Frank. Wolverine showed up, dressed as a cop. He then stalked Charles and the babysitter, eventually shooting the girl with Charles's gun, after which Charles committed suicide. Wolverine then went to Frank's place and abducted him for the supersoldier project.Wolverine: Origins #3 (2006). Marvel Comics. Years later, Frank Simpson was sent into the Vietnam War as a black-ops agent. Captured by the Viet Cong, Frank was severely tortured by Logan (who was posing as a Russian intelligence liaison), shattering Frank's still unbalanced mind. While torturing him (even carving the American flag into his face that years later would become part of his superpowered personality), he implanted the phrase \\"No V.C.!\\" as a trigger word, along with the compulsion to kill gruesomely, in retaliation for the tortures suffered, anyone who uttered the words. He then allowed Frank to escape, testing his work with a village of peasants, who, seeing an American soldier, tried to soothe his anger and convince him to spare them, shouting the \\"No V.C.!\\" phrase, meaning that they were not Viet Cong. Frank, in response to the trigger word, burnt the village to the ground, killing every inhabitant. The experiment being a success, Logan was installed as his handler. Due to his trauma, Nuke often hallucinates that the enemies he is fighting are the Viet Cong.Wolverine: Origins #2 (2006). Marvel Comics. At some time during the war, Nuke was inducted into the final part of the Project Homegrown, the Weapon VII programs, that turned him into a partial cyborg with a subdermal mesh able to deflect bullets, and a second heart that, working in conjunction with some (placebo) pills, controlled his aggression, leaving him addicted as well. His whereabouts after the war are still unknown.New X-Men #145. Marvel Comics. =First appearance= Nuke resurfaces employed by Generalissimo Felix Guillermo Carridad of Tierra Verde to destroy a rebel base. Carridad is impressed with his skills, and he enjoys using Nuke periodically as a superhuman iconic symbol.Wolverine (vol. 2) #18. Marvel Comics. Following an operation in Nicaragua, the Kingpin hires Nuke through a corrupt general and sends him to kill Daredevil. Nuke launches an attack on Hell's Kitchen, but is defeated by Daredevil. Enraged at a Daily Bugle article reporting on his mass murder in Hell's Kitchen, he escapes his handlers, intending to destroy the Daily Bugle building. He is intercepted by Captain America and shot by a military chopper. He faints from the wound and is presumed dead by the general public.Daredevil #232‚Äì233. Marvel Comics. Nuke was taken into custody by the government, still controlled by the Tierra Verde enclave.Wolverine: Origins #2. Marvel Comics. =Wolverine: Origins ‚Äì The Death of Wolverine= In the series Wolverine: Origins, following Wolverine's full memories regained, and embarking on a mission to take care of loose ends, the U.S. government dispatches Nuke to hunt Wolverine down.Wolverine: Origins #1‚Äì2. Marvel Comics. Though Wolverine dispatches Nuke, it is revealed that Nuke's enhanced physiology has further mutated, giving him cybernetic limbs, bones and skull, and the ability to survive the most gruesome injuries, but has left him devoid of any personality or conscience. When Wolverine tries to kill him, Captain America intervenes, believing that Nuke is a failed subject of the Super Soldier Program. Wolverine asks the telepath Emma Frost to restore Nuke's broken mind, saying that he‚Äôll euthanize Nuke if he determines this is not possible.Wolverine: Origins #3‚Äì5. Marvel Comics.

During Osborn's final confrontation, he sustains injuries that render him comatose.Thunderbolts #142 ‚Äì 145. Marvel Comics. Simpson is allied with the Iron Nail, attacking individuals in Europe that he perceives as enemies of America, until he is stopped by Captain America.Captain America Vol 7 #12. Marvel Comics. He is caught in an explosion and presumed dead.Captain America Vol 7 #17. Marvel Comics. Nuke later appears alive with a shaved head in the Death of Wolverine mini-series. He is seen working for Madame Hydra and hunting Wolverine as part of her bounty. While at a bar in British Columbia, Wolverine's adamantium skull headbutts Nuke to spread the word that he spared him while also getting the information on who placed the bounty on him.Death of Wolverine #1 Powers and abilities Nuke possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of various cybernetic enhancements. Nuke's bones have been replaced with advanced cybernetic components, granting him superhuman strength of an unrevealed limit. Aside from his strength, Nuke's body is considerably more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human; even the arcane nerve strikes Daredevil learned during training by his sensei, Stick, have no effect. Nuke's skin has been replaced with an artificial type of plastic that looks identical to human skin but is much more durable. In addition, he has an artificial secondary heart that works in conjunction with his colored pills. Nuke is the victim of decades of systematic physical and psychological conditioning at the hands of various individuals working for the United States government. As a result, Nuke is insane. He is now little more than a puppet in the hands of his current handler, and able only to follow issued commands. Also in his first appearance in Daredevil, Nuke was equipped with a monstrous multi-barrelled assault rifle which, in addition to being able to fire massive volleys of bullets, fragmentation grenades, and rockets, was also (due to mechanisms left unexplained) able to \\"keep count\\" of the casualties inflicted. Nuke also had a habit of resetting the counter after noting down each \\"score\\" trying to \\"better\\" it in the coming assignment. Apparently Nuke's metabolism is now remote controlled from a secret base on Tierra Verde, whose technicians are able to shut down the biomech systems in Nuke's body. =Pills= Nuke has a second heart, and takes different colored pills to produce different bodily effects. Nuke's pill colors are: red, for increased adrenaline; white, to keep him balanced between missions; and blue, to bring him down. It was originally stated that the red pills Nuke took affected his adrenal glands, sending him into his bloodthirsty rages. The Wolverine: Origins series retconned this, stating instead that these pills are placebos, suggesting that Nuke lives in a constant state of increased adrenaline, but is not aware of this. The pills, therefore, trigger his violent behavior, but the effect is psychosomatic. Other versions In the \\"House of M\\" storyline, Nuke is one of the government agents (alongside Mimic and Agent Barnes) sent to Genosha to kill Magneto and as many of his followers as possible. He and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes snuck into Magneto's headquarters.Civil War: House of M #3. Marvel Comics. When Nuke entered Wanda's bedroom in order to kill her, he was disassembled by her.Civil War: House of M #4. Marvel Comics. What If vol. 2 #48 showed what would have happened if Daredevil had saved Nuke. This story manifests as Ben Urich pondering the situation and thinking of alternatives.What If #48. Marvel Comics. The Ultimate Marvel version of Frank Simpson is the man who was given the Super Soldier Serum during the Vietnam War when Captain America was MIA after World War II, but his origin is more reminiscent of a post World War II equivalent.Ultimate Comics: Captain America #1. Marvel Comics. Like his mainstream counterpart, Simpson has the American Flag tattooed onto his face.Ultimate Comics: Captain America #2. Marvel Comics. Simpson, completely disillusioned by America after Vietnam (1972), is believed to have betrayed his country due to the war and the augmentations but has \\"seen the Light\\". He is trying to sell his reverse- engineered serum blood to the North Koreans, but is stopped by British S.A.S. and Steve Rogers. After his identity is revealed to Carol Danvers, Cap is beaten, and travels to Saloth, a Cambodian village but Simpson and his army (all pumped up with the Super-Soldier Serum) beat the Captain. Simpson vows to make Cap \\"see the light\\", strongly believing America stands for a number of atrocities in the last 50 years but Cap escapes and stops Simpson. He is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Simpson is later visited by Cap in the Triskelion, which has the Captain reading the Bible to Simpson who is now bed- ridden.Ultimate Comics: Captain America #4. Marvel Comics. In the Amalgam Comics universe, in which the characters of Marvel Comics were merged with those of DC Comics, Nuke is combined with DC's Bane as Hydra agent Bane Simpson.Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics. In other media The character appears on Jessica Jones renamed Will Simpson, portrayed by Wil Traval. He is a police sergeant at the 15th Precinct and previously served in the 39th Infantry Division. Introduced in season one, he is sent by Kilgrave to kill Trish Walker. Being convinced by Jessica Jones that his mission has been accomplished, Kilgrave commands him to jump off a rooftop. Jessica saves him, freeing him of Kilgrave's control, after which Simpson becomes a lover to Trish. He remains at odds with Jessica, as he is determined to murder Kilgrave to prevent from hurting anyone else. After his attempt to kill Kilgrave with a bomb fails, Simpson reconnects with his military unit, using experimental pills to increase combat awareness. He is now more manic, to the point that he kills fellow detective Oscar Clemons and two fellow operatives. He then attempts to kill Jessica, but is thwarted by both Jessica and Trish, when Trish takes some of his combat enhancements and overpowers him. Left unconscious, Simpson is later taken away by his doctor Miklos Kozlov and members of the mysterious \\"IGH\\" organization who provided him with the supplements. Early in season two, Simpson is now using an inhaler and spying on Trish. He eventually catches up to Trish at a movie set, where Trish shoots him in the leg. When Jessica catches up and confronts Simpson about a recent string of deaths of IGH members, Simpson states that Trish is being targeted because of an investigation into IGH, before they are abruptly attacked by an assailant who later kills Simpson by breaking his neck before escaping. Afterwards, Jessica and Trish take his body to the beach near Playland Park and Jessica tosses his body into the ocean. Trish gradually develops an addiction to the combat enhancers in Simpson's inhaler, subsequently developing superhuman abilities.

H≈ìnheim is located on the river Ill and the Rhine-Marne canal. The historic center is on a ridge and overlooking the \\"Ried\\" (Zone of easily flooded meadows) of Ill. This historical center gave the name to H≈ìnheim, the first mentions indicate the spelling Hohenheim, in other words residence on the hill. History Vestiges and reports raised on the ground attest the existence of a small group of dwellings near Hoenheim from the Neolithic age. The first mention of the name Hoenheim goes back to the year 742. At the end of the 9th century, the village of H≈ìnheim was the property of the Benedictine monastery of Honau, created by the brother of Saint Odile. Under the Holy Roman Empire, H≈ìnheim became the property of the diocese of Strasbourg, which allotted its land to knights or religious communities. Around the mid-14th century, the diocese made a gift of the Fief of H≈ìnheim to knights. 1350 sees the first written mention of the Chapel of John the Baptist. During the Hundred Years' War, H≈ìnheim, like many villages, had to undergo the passage of the \\"√âcorcheurs\\" who tried, without success, to take Strasbourg. While passing through the hands of various noble families, the Fief finally returned to the Uttenheim of Ramstein family in 1457. In the 16th century, the lords of Uttenheim, dismayed by the escapades of the clergy of this time, joined the Reformation and with them the inhabitants of Hoenheim. At the time of the Thirty Years' War, Hoenheim, like Bischheim, was a victim of the exactions of the two sides. In 1649, at the time of the treaty of Westphalia, putting an end to the war, Alsace returned to France and subsequent Catholicism. In 1676 the last lord of Uttenheim died without an heir. The quarrel of succession ended in 1681 with the victory of the family Rathamhausen of Stein over the canons of the great chapter of Strasbourg. In 1689, the elder branch of Rathamhausen dies out and the Fief of H≈ìnheim returns to the great chapter of Strasbourg. On May 21, 1691, the bishop of Strasbourg gave the Fief to the knight-lord of Chamlay, mar√©chal g√©n√©ral des logis des camps et des arm√©es de France. In 1719 the marshal of Chamlay died without leaving an heir. The bishop of Strasbourg, Cardinal of Rohan (Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan), gave the Fief to the Klinglin family which had the full confidence of the royal and local authorities. After the French Revolution, Hoenheim was attached to the new district of Strasbourg (March 4, 1790) during the formation of the Departments. In the same year, at the suggestion of Schiltigheim, the \\"Ried\\" (Zone of easily flooded meadows), previously public pasture common to Souffelweyersheim, Hoenheim, Bischheim, Adelsoffen and Schiltigheim was divided. This division led, amongst other things, to the creation of the enclave of Bischheim and the enclave of Schiltigheim in the centre of Hoenheim's territory. October 2, 1791, all the goods of the Klinglin family and of the church were confiscated and sold to the inhabitants. In 1792, the √âmigr√©, joined forces with the Austro-Prussians begin the hostilities to regain the power in France. From October to December 1793, engagements between the troops of the French Republic and the Austro-Prussians took place around the Hoenheim - Griesheim-on-Souffel - Dingsheim line, until the Austro-Prussians troops were pushed back out of Alsace by January 1794. In 1793, the commune of Hoenheim was attached to the canton of Hausbergen. February 17, 1800, Hoenheim was attached to the new district of Strasbourg. In 1813, Napoleon's Russian campaign finished in catastrophe. He managed, with difficulty, to return to France, but the troops of the Coalition were behind him. In January 1814, the French troops were kept in Strasbourg by the attacks of the Cossacks who settled in Hoenheim, Bischheim and Schiltigheim. Following Napoleon's return and defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the General Jean Rapp, having wind of intentions to annex Alsace and under the orders of Louis XVIII continued to fight on the Souffel, just north of Hoenheim. The battle of Souffelweyersheim-Hoenheim took place on June 28 and 29, 1815. With the victory of Coalition troops, Strasbourg was taken on July 9. In 1852 two new transportation routes passed by the territory of Hoenheim (but away from the village). The first is the Marne‚ÄìRhine Canal which connects Vitry-le-Fran√ßois to Strasbourg. The second is the Paris-Strasbourg railway line. The Franco- Prussian War from 1870-1871 began on July 19, 1870. On August 7, the day after the battle of Froeschwiller-Woerth, the German troops arrived in Hoenheim. The troops settled in Reichstett, a few kilometres north of Hoenheim, and began the siege of Strasbourg on August 12. With the treaty of Frankfurt in May 1871, France was required to give up the three departments of the Alsace- Moselle. Between 1871 and 1919, Hoenheim is attached to the \\"Kreises Strassburg (Land)\\". Railway workshops opened in 1875 in Bischheim on a 30 ha, with 10 ha located in Hoenheim. These workshops were located on the new railway line connecting Strasbourg to Lauterbourg. October 14, 1878, inauguration of the Tramway Place Kl√©ber (Strasbourg) - Hoenheim. June 19, 1879, the first holder of the Catholic parish of Hoenheim was named in the new church of Hoenheim. Previously Hoenheim depended from the parish of Bischheim, which church was used by the Protestant of Bischheim too. Inauguration of the marshalling yard of Hausbergen in 1906. It covers the territory of several communes, one of which was Hoenheim. In 1907, the priest of Hoenheim, Dionysius Will, is elected on the Reichstag under the label of Progressivist but with the support of the Socialists. The First World War, fought away from the Rhineland area did not cause any physical damage to Hoenheim, but resulted in the death of many men. The 'lost departments' of Alsace-Moselle were given back to the France by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. June 28, 1919 the canton of Bischheim - Hoenheim is attached to the new district of Strasbourg- Countryside. September 2, 1939, the inhabitants of the communes in front of the Maginot line are evacuated. The inhabitants of Hoenheim, Bischheim and Schiltigheim are moved to the Bruche valley to join the evacuee centre of Niederhaslach. Only the town hall secretary and some firemen remain in the town. On September 9 a second journey awaits the evacuated inhabitants, this time the destination is to the South of France. The inhabitants of Hoenheim are divided in 5 communes of Haute-Vienne which they will leave only in August 1940 to return to Alsace annexed by the Germans. Under the Nazi occupation, Hoenheim is administratively attached to the ‚ÄúGross Strasburg‚Äù. May 27, August 11 and September 25, 1944, the bombardment of Strasbourg and its suburbs by the Allies: Junkers factories in Meinau, railway workshops of Bischheim and marshalling yard of Hausbergen are all attacked. November 23 Strasbourg is released by the 2nd French Armoured Division of General Leclerc, who assigns the local FFI to liberate the suburbs. Yet Hoenheim and its neighbourhoods remained under the fire of the German batteries until April 1945. The last Tram ran to Hoenheim on May 1, 1960, leaving only the bus as a public transport link with Strasbourg. In 1966, Hoenheim was integrated into the newly created Urban Community of Strasbourg. In 1969, the collapse of the frontage of the Chapel of John the Baptist obliged the Protestant parish to seek a new building. 1970 saw the completion of the construction of the motorway A34 Metz - Strasbourg, later taken over by A4 connecting Paris to Strasbourg, alongside the marshalling yard of Hausbergen. In 1978, the Protestant parish of Hoenheim inaugurated its church. The Protestant parish left the renovated Chapel of John the Baptist to the use of the Romanian Orthodox parish. With the new public transport policy, a new tram line was built by the Urban Community of Strasbourg during the 1990s, with the B tram line linking Hoenheim and Strasbourg completed in 2001. The terminus of the B-Line in Hoenheim links the B tram line with the Strasbourg-Lauterbourg railway line.

Other names and indexes for the same vehicle include ZiU-682 and HTI-682 (Cyrillic: –ó–∏–£-682 and –•–¢–ò-682). The ZiU acronym stands for Zavod imeni Uritskogo, which is a plant named after Moisei Uritsky, the Russian revolutionary. Before 1996 this acronym was also a trademark of the vehicle manufacturer. It has been changed to Trolza. The ZiU-9 was put in mass production in 1971 and it was still assembled along with other more advanced trolleybus vehicles in the Trolza (former ZiU) factory until 2014. The total number of produced ZiU-9s exceeds 42,000 vehicles. In addition, many copies of ZiU-9 were made in other factories of the former Soviet bloc. This model is the most numerous trolleybus vehicle in the world.  History and development  ZiU-9G trolleybus in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia The explosion-like development of trolleybus systems in the Soviet Union in the 1960s required a large number of trolleybus vehicles. The mainstay of the contemporary Soviet trolley fleet, the ZiU-5, was not sufficient for huge urban passenger transfers. It was more suited for medium-size cities rather than large megapolises such as Moscow or Saint Petersburg. In addition the ZiU-5 had an aluminium hull, which was expensive and complicated from a technological point of view. The two doors in the ZiU-5 hull ends did not work well in overcrowded situations which were quite common in Soviet public transportation. The ZiU-9 was a quite successful attempt to solve these problems. It has one extra door compared to the ZiU-5. Two doors are wide and placed in the middle and rear end of the vehicle hull. One small door in the front end of the vehicle was/is comfortable for the driver and for outgoing passengers. The hull of the ZiU-9 is a welded steel one and it is significantly cheaper and simpler in production than the hull of the ZiU-5. ZiU-9 drawing The electrical equipment of the ZiU-9 had some minor differences from the ZiU-5. The power of the main motor was increased. The indirect resistor-based control system of electric current was slightly modified to deal with the increased power of the main motor. While western designers developed new semiconductor-based control devices, Soviet engineers decided to leave the old resistor-based system for service simplicity. The first prototype vehicles were tested in Moscow in 1971 and were approved for mass production after some minor design adjustments. The '9' in the vehicle name was the initial project index of the design team. However, after launching mass production, the new trolleybus received a new index '682' from the united classification of non-rail public transport vehicles. So all series vehicles had a ZiU-682 designation. But the number 682 is difficult to pronounce and the shorter '9' still lives in the everyday language of drivers and servicemen. In 1986, the new classification was introduced and the former ZiU-682 was designated as HTI-682. But this was not an end of renaming the same vehicle. The Russian acronym HTI in the Cyrillic alphabet is –•–¢–ò and these three Cyrillic letters in 1995 were confused with the Latin letters XTU. This Latin acronym became an official name of the vehicle. Production =ZiU-9= The first prototype ZiU-9 was built in 1966. Elements of the appearance and number of design decisions were borrowed from contemporary to the time foreign firms MAN and Chausson. =ZiU-9A= ZiU-9A - experimental version with wide body to 2680 mm. The only prototype was made in 1968. =ZiU-682B= right In August 1972, began production of the first production series ZiU-682B (with designation change ZiU ZiU -9 -682 was due to the labeling requirements of bringing industry classifier). First serial trolley cars differed from later releases. Until 1974, had an angular wheel arches, and not circular. The first batch of trolleybuses raised outdated engine DC-207G, which in 1973 was replaced by the DC-210 110 kW. Suspension on the first ZiU-682B was pneumatic, with torque rods as guiding elements, later became pnevmoressornoy. Rear funded playground had a reduced level of the floor, which reduced the number of steps one at the back door and to facilitate loading wheelchairs and prams and large items. However, this \\"advantage\\" was leveled by a high handrail on the steps of separating the rear and middle doors. Transition from high floor in the cabin to lower smoothly carried out in the aisle between the rear wheel arches, which caused inconvenience to passengers at peak hours (especially in winter), standing on an icy downhill \\"hill.\\" In 1991, developers have replaced high-speed separator handrail attached to the door, but by this time all storage sites were at three stages from sidewalk level. For natural ventilation the roof of the cabin was equipped with four ceiling hatches, each equipped with a sliding side window pane. Currently, the only instance of ZIU-9B is preserved and operated in the linear regime in the city of Zaporozhye and has the side number 562. =ZiU-682V (B00/B0A)= Trolleybus ZiU-682v in Minsk At the end of 1976 began mass production next update ZiU- 682V, which replaced ZiU- 682B . Due to the presence of design flaws that emerged during the first years of operation, rather than jet thrust bearing elements as suspension springs were used . Since 1976, the number of fixtures in the cabin has been reduced from 12 to 11, every other window in the cabin lost air vents . Since 1978, the number of ceiling hatches reduced to three (due to hatch on the front axle ), steel trolley equipped with electric shtangoulovitelyami (apparently on the orders, since their machines Moscow was not until 1996 ) . Since 1983, changed the shape and location of the front and rear position lamps . Lights original form, informally called \\" boats\\" have been replaced by unified and offset edges closer to route indicators . In 1985 a similar design changes undergone external signal lights and turn indicators . From March - May 1984 trolleybuses were produced without the low -level rear accumulation area, which was due to the need to strengthen the base structure of the body in the rear overhang . In 1985, the nameplate trolley was partially aligned with the standards forming the VIN code, which led to a change in marking HTI682V00 . Since 1988, the plant switched to production modifications ZiU- 682V -012 ( ZiU- 682V0A ) powered DC -213 capacity of 115 kW. Since 1989, changed the shape of the housing radioreaktors roof trolley, it has decreased in size and had a sharp edge. In 1989, production started in parallel transition modification ZiU- 682V0B on which electric drive door opener was replaced pneumatically . =ZiU-682G = A trolleybus on Leninskogo Komsomola Avenue in Vidnoye, Moscow Oblast, Russia By the end of 1980 . individual components trolley manufactured at that time was almost 20 years, significantly outdated. Therefore, simultaneously with the launch of a series of recent modifications ZiU- 682V preparing to produce more profound modernization of the model trolley, which was designated ZiU- 682G. Experienced instances ZiU- 682G were released in 1988, and since February 1, 1991 the plant was fully passed on their production. In addition to the changes already introduced earlier models ZiU 682V0A - and - ZiU 682V0B model ZiU- 682G has received the following differences. Front, under the windshield, placed the intake grille. Changed the location of windows with vents along the starboard side. Undergone significant redevelopment salon trolley. Most of the seats along the left side of the body is replaced with a double row on row, which increased the number of standing places. Changed design seat themselves and their handrails. Big changes undergone cab. Partition behind the driver, which had previously oval window became deaf; extended sliding door in the driver's cabin. In the cabin itself changed the layout of the dashboard, which became made of black plastic. Out of the past neergonomichny remote control trolley bus right from the dashboard, consisting of two long rows of identical tumblers. Control of external light devices was moved to the steering column. On a dedicated right panel were only control door opening, the wiper switch and alarm. Other switches transferred to the new control panel by trolley to the left of the driver's side near the window. Redesigned suspension and brake pedals at the same time control approached the car. On the other hand, ZiU- 682G supplied to provincial towns, 1993‚Äì2000., Compared with the previous model ZiU- 682V had significantly lighter load bearing elements of the frame component of the supporting frame (apparently, in order to reduce cost). As a result, in severe operating conditions (e.g. in Nizhny Novgorod) for 5 years, these structural elements to rot completely corroded, punctured a gentle kick screwdriver. Since 1997, the base modification in mass production became ZiU- 682G -012 ( ZiU- 682G0A ). External difference between the new modification was reduced in height side window of the cab, also has another location pane. Minor changes have been planning the cabin. In fact it was adapted for the domestic market modification export version trolley ZiU- 682G -010, the production of which began in 1992. On the basis of ZiU- 682G -012 began the further modernization of trolley conducted mainly commissioned Mosgortransa (as most other Russian cities at that time became insolvent ) and divided into several stages. For low voltage power generator instead of 63.3701 and auxiliary engine DC - 661B was set low noise static converter. Been improved waterproofing and grounding . Trolleybus began to possess higher corrosion protection, a number of sites now executes from aluminum, stainless steel and fiberglass. In parallel with ZiU- 682G -012, in 1998, started production in transition modification ZiU- 682G -014 ( ZiU- 682G0E ), which replace the old sofas in the lounge were installed individual padded seats, applied laser (source ?) Heaters cabin windows. This version is also equipped with a static converter. =ZiU-682G-016, 017 and 018= overhaul with the removal of part of the apparatus on the roof As a result of the continuation of the modernization of the trolley in the same 1998 there was a modification ZiU- 682G -016 ( ZiU- 682G0M ), which became the base model . Exterior siding boards became run from extruded galvanized steel sheet, which improved the appearance of the trolley and increased its corrosion resistance. Casement doors were subjected to additional rustproofing special compound. A great deal of work to improve the electrical trolley : applied dielectric coating rods susceptor set travel stops rods, improved insulation chicanery, installed in the cab indicator of leakage currents, improved design -board covers and sealing side compartments, redesigned heater . Also applied to the trolley locking system running with the doors open . Back in the mid -1990s, it became apparent that the location of electrical underneath the trolley does not meet modern requirements of electric, because it does not protect it from moisture, anti-icing agents and many others, and also allows you to go through a puddle, if the depth exceeds ten centimeters. Then, in 1995, the model was designed ZiU- 52642, which is a major upgrade ZiU- 682G with the removal of electrical equipment on the roof of the trolley and other changes . However, for various reasons in the model series did not go. The first production series with the removal of part of the apparatus on the roof became ZiU- 682G -017 ( ZiU- 682G0H ), launched in 2000. Unlike experienced ZiU- 52642 equipped with Thyristor-pulse control system, modification ZiU- 682G -017 remained equipped classical, uneconomical and unsupported acceptable smoothness Rheostat- contactor control system, electrical equipment factory \\"Dinamo \\" conventional platen doors. Some of the changes undergone interior, in particular, have been installed interior lights more modern form. From 2002 to request the trolley began to be produced in variants with altered appearance cabin (this applied fiberglass pad ) . =ZiU-682G-016.02 and ZiU-682G-016.03= ZiU-682G-016.02 in Vladimir, Russia. Since October 2002, commercially produced modification ZiU- 682G - 016.02, which is a further development of the model ZiU- 682G -018 . Siding boards made of seamless steel sheet paneling front of the trolley combined with the use of fiberglass panels . The front bumper is also made of fiberglass. Passenger cabin windows are tinted glass, install new panoramic windshield . By trolley runs increased corrosion protection body, including the use of conductive soils firm ¬´Sikkens¬ª in lap welds, phosphate protective coating, as well as additional coverage base, sides, front and rear of the protective coating . On trolley mounted traction motor DC - 213A production Moscow factory \\"Dinamo\\" 110 kW . Control system - rheostat- contactor . Most of traction electric trolley put to the roof . Collectors located on the roof, power resistors, group controller, radioreaktory circuit breaker WB -7 ( there is an option to install instead of the WB -7 breaker manual AV- 8 in the cab at the rear ), a static converter ( IPT-600/28 or BP -3G ), stroke limiter rods. Behind the driver is case inside of which has an electric panel protective relays . In this regard, the first window on the left side of the passenger compartment has reduced dimensions, there is no passenger seat facing the front wheel arch . Interior lighting passenger compartment carried fluorescent fixtures have modes full, partial and emergency lighting . Passenger room is equipped with separate comfortable seats ( which, however, often criticized for full passengers trouble and inconvenience) . Two passenger seats are equipped to transport people with limited mobility. Parking brake acts on the brakes the drive wheels of energy storage, control of air in the cab of the crane . Hydraulic oil tank is equipped with power steering oil level warning device . To improve the electrical introduced fiberglass boards, electrical insulation flaps passenger doors from the body, external electrical insulation rod current collectors, insulation monitoring device UKI, emergency switch, the imposition of mostly electric traction kit from under the floor to the roof, technological track on the roof to move attendants, rear stopper rods pantographs fitted to three electrical insulators, locking the trolley system with open doors, emergency ( spare ) the passenger area lighting system ANTI passenger doors, emergency exits through the windows of the cabin, equipment service doors from inside and outside governments to open in an emergency installation on the roof of a high-speed circuit-breaker with remote control, etc. Since 2004, also commercially produced trolley ZiU- 682G - 016.03 . Its main difference from ZiU - 682G - 016.02 is that the frame ( base) body made of an open profile ( sill ), which increases the rigidity and makes it more resistant to corrosion. Trolleybus body ZiU- 682G 016.03 - welded frame construction . As an option, the setting of a wide front double doors swing- slide-type ( which is especially important for Moscow, used to pay for travel validator ) . Since September 2009, in connection with the termination of a license to manufacture trolleybuses issue ZiU 682G016.02 - and - ZiU 682G016.03 discontinued. =ZiU-682G-016.04 and ZiU-682G-016.05= Or√´l Since September 2009, JSC \\"Trolza\\" in accordance with the obtained license for production to start the production of trolleybuses ZiU-682G-016.04 and ZiU-682G-016.05. And apparently, these trolleys and constructive modifications almost completely replicate their predecessors ZiU-682G-016.02 and ZiU-682G-016.03. As changes in the rank of permanent options included installing electronic route signs and a marquee in the passenger compartment and ABS that ZiU-682G-ZiU 016.02 and 016.03-682G-performed by the customer. =Modifications as of 2012= Note that approximately 2003 JSC \\"Trolza\\" changed several notations produced models trolleybuses family ZiU- 682G, considering them all modifications ZiU- 682G -016 (VIN- code starts with all modifications XTU682G0M ) . As of 2010 the manufacturer offers the following serial modifications ( listed in order of increasing number of changes compared to ZiU- 682G ) * ZiU- 682G -016 (012 ) - basic model similar ZiU- 682G -012 (delivery in the form of a body 1st version) * ZiU- 682G -016 (018) - modification, similar ZiU- 682G -018, and has a slight performance improvement ZiU- 682G -016 (delivery in the form of a body 1st version) * ZiU- 682G - 016.02 (delivery in the form of a body 1st version) * ZiU- 682G - 016.03 (delivery in the form of a body 1st version) * ZiU- 682G - 016.04 * ZiU- 682G - 016.05 In 2009, Trolza developed a modified ZiU- 682G - 016.07 . This machine has a total 016.04 with different numbering and control system - TrSU \\" Chergos \\" instead of the standard rheostat- contactor . The only instance in operation in Murmansk. The serial production for the ZiU-9 was discontinued in 2014 due to a lack of demand for the model. 300px Clones produced by other companies Many factories in modern Russia or Belarus developed their unlicensed or semi-licensed copies of the ZiU-9 design.

Originally 174 of them were used in the capital of the city, Budapest and a few dozens more in other cities. Although some buses are still in working condition and are used occasionally on retro and heritage trolley services. ZiU-9s worked or are now working in all ex-USSR countries except the Baltic states. They are also in service in Belgrade, Serbia. They were also sold to Greece, Argentina, in Colombia the EDTU (Empresa Distrital de Transportes Urbanos) was a larger operator of these buses; they was in a very bad conservation state in the former Eastern Bloc countries. Three cars were on loan in 1973 for testing purposes in Helsinki, Finland.  Greek donation  In 2004, the ILPAP, the operator of trolleybusses in Athens, Greece donated nearly all of its old ZiU-9 trolleybuses to the city of Belgrade and to Georgia. One was donated to the East Anglia Transport Museum. Belgrade has had ZiU-9 trolleys of its own since late 1970s. In 2010 a public action was taken to save Belgrade's first ZiU-9 from being scrapped.

He is profiled in Vasari's Le Vite delle pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori (or, in English, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects). He was born in Ferrara and studied there, probably under Domenico Panetti. Few facts of his life are known. His principal artistic activity was in Venice, Ferrara, and especially in Cremona, where he founded a school in which Garofalo was a pupil. His most celebrated achievement is the frescoes in the Cathedral of Cremona (1506‚Äì1519) representing the Birth of the Virgin and some subjects from her life. His position there was taken over by Altobello Melone. His remaining works, which include the Marriage of Saint Catherine (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), the Virgin and Child with Four Saints (Venice, San Giuliano), the Virgin and Two Saints (Cremona, San Quirilo), and the Holy Family (Paris, Louvre), are considered by Lanzi remarkable for richness of drapery, variety of color, spirit and grace of attitude, and harmony of landscape. Several works formerly attributed to Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, and Garofalo are now ascribed to Boccaccino. Boccaccino died in Cremona. His son and pupil Camillo Boccaccino (1501‚Äì46) was a painter active in Cremona. Paintings by Boccaccino are in the Milwaukee Art Museum, Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest), the Uffizi and National Museum of Art of Romania (Bucharest).

The Centre was developed initially by the Kern Corporation Limited and constructed by subsidiary, Kern Construction and was the brainchild of the then MD, Mr. V.B. Paul; it was intended to create a retail focus to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games held in 1982.  History  The location previously operated as the Wintergarden Theatre cinema complex from 1924 until it closed in 1973 and was demolished in 1981. The original building was designed by Ballantyne and Hare of Melbourne. Hall and Prentice in Brisbane provided local design assistance. The theatre featured a Wurlitzer pipe organ which could be raised and lowered from the orchestra pit. In 1929 the rival Regent Theatre opened in Queen Street in 1929. With the transfer of ownership of the theatre to the Kern Corporation in the 1970s, and plans for the construction of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre at South Bank, the Her Majestys Theatre building next door to the Wintergarden was also marked for demolition and inclusion in the proposed new Wintergarden shopping centre.  Shopping precinct development  The development beginning in the 1980s covered two stages, the first provided for three levels of retail and a two- storey carpark above. It boasted several national retailers previously unknown to Brisbane shoppers and the first CBD food courts covering a variety of cuisines. In 1987 the second stage was developed adjacent to the Stage 1 and comprised additional specialty shops a multi-cuisine sit-down restaurant (again, a first for the City and originally operated for 24-hours) and the Hilton Hotel which was intended to provide 5-star accommodation for the 1988 Brisbane World Expo. In November 2009, it was announced that a $100 million refurbishment of Wintergarden would take place in two 12-month stages.http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/wintergarden-to- get-100m-facelift-20091119-io0g.html The Wintergarden's facade was enhanced on all three street frontages. As part of the exterior works, the old skybridge linking the Wintergarden to the David Jones department store was removed. In addition, screens were placed above each entrance, which feature programmed LED lighting.http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/wintergarden-to- get-100m-facelift-20091119-io0g.html Redevelopment principal architect was The Buchan Group, and redevelopment fa√ßade architects were Studio 505.

History =In Bohemia= First noted in the power struggles of the 10th‚Äì12th centuries in Bohemia. The Vr≈°ovci were the third most powerful political force in newly Christianized Bohemia, after the reigning P≈ôemyslids (P≈ôemyslovci) and the contending Slavn√≠ks (Slavn√≠kovci). They were active in Bohemian conflicts with Poland, Hungary and the Kings and Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, and also in the intermittent internal conflicts common for feudally fragmented regimes of that time. The Vr≈°ovci possessed such towns as ≈Ωatec and Litomƒõ≈ôice. Litomƒõ≈ôice as seen from the Radob√Ωl Hill They had consanguinity with the P≈ôemyslidi and often cooperated with them. Some historians supposed that, unlike their opponents, the other two leading families of Bohemia, the Vr≈°ovci could have retained some pagan beliefs in the 10th century. The etymology of the clan name is still a subject of dispute. One version claims its origin to be Czech \\"fishnet\\" i.e. \\"Vr≈°a\\", while another opinion would have it derived from \\"Vrsa/Vrsvs\\" (\\"Ursa/Ursus\\"), Latin for \\"female bear/bear\\". The Vr≈°ovci, P≈ôemyslids and Slavn√≠ki took part in cruel power struggles that occurred in Bohemia on the turn of the first millennium. Vr≈°ovci and P≈ôemyslids led by Boleslav II the Pious, fought with the rival princely clan of Slavniki. On September 28, 995 they stormed Libice nad Cidlinou in Central Bohemia and conquered the Slavn√≠ki. Among the victims were four or five brothers of future catholic saint Adalbert (, ), then bishop of Prague. According to the legends the saint was very impulsive. He damned the murderers(Vr≈°ovci). However, as some legend says the saint know how to moderate \\"the horse of his anger\\" in order to not \\"deviate from a bright way of the eternal life\\" so he escaped from Bohemia to Hungary and Poland, also legend says that he predicted the prosecution of Vr≈°ovci. In 1003, when the Vr≈°ovci tried to dethrone Boleslav III the Red. When the expatriated duke returned to Bohemia possibly with the support of Duke Boles≈Çaw I the Brave of Poland, he ordered a massacre of the Vr≈°ovci at Vy≈°ehrad. According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Boleslav slashed to death his son-in-law (Vr≈°oviec) with his own sword during Lent. In 1108 the Vr≈°ovci came into disfavour again, and were massacred by hostile P≈ôemyslids‚Äînamely Svatopluk. Many nobles were executed on Pet≈ô√≠n Hill. = Possible further shelter or interrelations = The later history of the family is unclear; there are two or more versions: # The whole family was perfidiously executed in 1109.\\"Encyklopedyja Powszechna\\" vol. 6 article \\"Czechy\\" p. 391 (published by Samuel Orgelbrand in Warszawa, 1861) # The same source suggests that it could have happened that some of them escaped to Kingdom of Poland and acted from there yet in 1100. Similarly, one of two versions by Kasper Niesiecki (considering origin of Polish Rawicz bearers) says that some of them were amiably accepted in 1108 by the King Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth of Poland, who granted them lands in Rawa Voivodship; also Jan D≈Çugosz supports it (however the other version by Kasper Niesiecki ‚Äì \\"the better one\\" is that the origin of Polish Rawicz bearers is pagan Polish). # Controversially, they may have been captured by Andalusian Muslims and used as saqaliba. If the second is true, it could be that some of Vr≈°ovci (because phonetically similar surnames were spotted among szlachta of two Polish coat of arms), in the midst of nobility referred to as Oksza (Werszowic, Werszowiec, Wierszowiec)Tadeusz Gajl, HERBARZ POLSKI Lista Nazwisk and Rawicz (Warsz, Warsza) bearers, probably participated in the Battle of Grunwald. Polish Rawicz (Ursin) coat of arms Polish Oksza coat of arms In the historical records among 50 Polish \\"banners\\" (regiments) is one (the 26th) under the Rawicz coat of arms led by Christian of Ostr√≥w, castellan of Krak√≥w, also a war councillor and one of the seven chief members of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland's general headquarters. Derslaw of Wlostow, of the arms Oksza, served as a scout and on the field of battle, and Peter of Wlostow, also of the arms Oksza, one of the knights selected by the Poles to initiate the battle. In addition, one of the Rawicz bearers, Christian of Goworzici, is marked for his military valour in the Battle of Koronowo, shortly after that of Grunwald. Oksza knights also participated at Koronowo, specifically Dobko Oksza and Jan Rey of Naglowic. For the most famous Oksza bearer, see: Miko≈Çaj Rej z Nag≈Çowic. In 1994‚Äì97, Miko≈Çaj Rej's descendant and namesake, Nicholas Andrew Rey (1938‚Äì2009), served as American ambassador to Poland.  See also  * Thietmar of Merseburg. Chronicon; * Cosmas of Prague.

By his father's will he succeeded to the title Prince of Capua, an appanage to the throne, while his brother William succeeded to the throne. Henry's coronation as prince was postponed from the death of his father (1166). He was present with William at Taranto, where the young king awaited his Greek bride. They planned to return via Capua and there invest Henry with his principality, but not far off from the town, Henry came down with a high fever. He was hurried to Salerno and thence to Palermo, but died within the month. According to legend, he was betrothed to a daughter of Malcolm IV of Scotland on his deathbed, but this is false. Malcolm had no issue. He was originally buried in the chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene, but was moved by his brother to Monreale, the final resting place of most of his family. The death of Henry made his aunt Princess Constance, confined to Santissimo Salvatore, Palermo as a nun from childhood, the only legitimate heir to the throne; despite this, she remained confined until 1184.

The black and white short was made on 16mm film while Scott was a photography student at the Royal College of Art in London in 1962. Although a very early work - Scott would not direct his first feature for another 15 years - the film is significant in that it features a number of visual elements that would become motifs of Scott's work. Shot entirely in West Hartlepool and Seaton Carew the film features the cooling tower and blast furnaces of the local British Steel North Works foreshadowing images in Alien, Blade Runner and Black Rain. The central element of the Boy and Bicycle is re-used in Scott's advert for Hovis of the early 1970s. The film features Scott's younger brother, Tony Scott, as the boy. ‚ÄúWe were both experiencing the process that would fundamentally take us through our live together, in terms of making movies,‚Äù Ridley Scott commented about the film and his brother. Scott secured finance from the British Film Institute to complete the editing and sound in 1965 including a track by John Barry called \\"Onward Christian Spacemen\\" (which originally appeared as the B-side of a cover version of the theme to The Human Jungle television series). Scott wanted to use the existing recording by Barry, but the composer was so impressed by the young filmmaker he agreed to produce a new recording for the film at limited cost.

It went through a number of changes of ownership. The business was sold to Focus DIY in August 1998, which entered administration in May 2011, with all stores closing by July 2011. History WHSmith acquired the business of LCP Home Improvements Limited, on 31 December 1978. The acquired company, which had been formed in December 1963, was renamed W.H. Smith Do It All Limited on the same date, and traded thereafter as WHSmith Do It All. LCP Homecentres, as the trading company was branded, was itself the product of a merger between two DIY chains, Big K and Calypso, which were bought by LCP, Lunt Comley & Pitt, as a cash generator for their industrial group, which had been formed following the nationalisation of the coal mines. Do It All sold a range of over 25,000 DIY products, including paint, wallpaper, tools and power tools, and construction materials. This was such as plywood and chipboard. All stores had an inhouse timber cutting service, and all but the smallest had in store concessions. This was such as the store in Bury, Greater Manchester, which included floorspace for Harris Carpets. During the 1980s, fierce competition, and the choice to not acquire new stores, saw the chain struggle. It was merged with the rival chain Payless DIY in April 1988, owned by the Boots Group. One example of their lack of new store acquisition, was their choice to not take space in the newly opened Merry Hill Shopping Centre, based upon the belief that trading out of a location in Netherton, and Brierley Hill, was the better option. One further example of this flawed policy, relates to a site in Christchurch, Dorset. Opposite the huge Somerford housing estate at the eastern end of the Christchurch bypass, was a small industrial estate. One of the companies located there, Revvo Castors, closed, and the site was offered to Do It All. Their analysis of the site was that it would not be profitable, based upon the assertion that; ‚Äúpeople in council houses do not spend money on DIY‚Äù. That site was subsequently developed by Great Mills, and it became far and away their most successful store. Other similar, ill considered decisions resulted in them falling far short of the expansion rate achieved by B&Q;, which ultimately was one significant cause of their downfall. The combined group, in which WHSmith and Boots both had 50%, represented, by them of each owning an ordinary share in the company. It was rebranded under the Do It All brand. Fortunes did not improve, however. After periods of substantial losses, on 12 June 1996, WHSmith sold their share in the company to Boots, for the gift voucher of ¬£1, giving the latter full ownership. =Fate= Boots, wanting to concentrate on its core pharmacy businesses, on 20 August 1998, sold the 139 stores to Focus DIY, for ¬£68 million. The stores were initially rebranded under the name Focus Do It All, the first stores being converted being in February 1999, before being rebranded again in September 2001, as simply Focus, following the company's acquisition in December 2000, of Great Mills, whose stores had already been converted under ‚ÄúFocus (For DIY & Gardening)‚Äù. Focus DIY acquired Wickes in September 2000, and some former stores of Do It All were converted to Wickes, mostly in areas felt to be outside the core market. After 2001, the Do It All name vanished from high streets, shopping malls and retail parks. Focus sold Wickes to builders' merchants Travis Perkins in December 2004. The sale was completed in February 2005. The brand Payless DIY was revived in September 2008, as part of Focus DIY's autumn advertising campaign; ‚ÄúDo More, Payless‚Äù.

Early life and career Gardiner was born on November 23, 1901 in Chicago, the daughter of Edward Morris, president of the Morris & Company meat-packing business, and Helen (n√©e Swift) Morris, a member of the family which owned Swift & Company, another meat-packing firm (her parents eventually divorced and her mother remarried to British politician and playwright Francis Neilson). She was born into a family of wealth and privilege.Joseph Berger, \\"Muriel Gardiner, who Helped Hundreds Escape Nazis, Dies\\", nytimes.com, February 7, 1985; accessed December 16, 2011 After graduating from Wellesley College in 1922 she traveled to Europe where she lived until the outbreak of World War II. She attended the University of Oxford and then, in 1926, went to Vienna, hoping to study psycho-analysis and be analyzed by Sigmund Freud. She received a degree in medicine from the University of Vienna and married Joseph Buttinger, leader of the Austrian Revolutionary Socialists. In 1934, she became involved in anti- Fascist activities. Using the code name \\"Mary\\", she smuggled passports and money and offered her home as a safe house for anti-Fascist dissidents, activities which she described in her memoir Code Name Mary: Memoirs of an American Woman in the Austrian Underground (1983). At the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 1939, the couple and their daughter moved to the United States. Gardiner edited The Wolf-Man by the Wolf-Man, which documents the case history of a wealthy young Russian who went to Vienna in 1910 to be analyzed by Freud and who became the subject of Freud's History of an Infantile Neurosis. Gardiner met Freud only once, but she knew the \\"Wolf-Man\\" in Vienna, and Code Name Mary carries a foreword by Freud's daughter, Anna Freud. In 1976, she authored a study of teenage violence called The Deadly Innocents. Between 1965 and 1984, Gardiner gave a total of to the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed Association (now called The Watershed Institute), including Brookdale Farm and two other properties.Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed Association website; accessed December 16, 2011. In 1983, Gardiner became entangled in the controversy between Mary McCarthy and Lillian Hellman, when she claimed that she was the character called Julia in Hellman's memoirs, Pentimento (1973), and in the movie Julia based on a chapter of that book. Hellman, who never met Gardiner, claimed that her \\"Julia\\" was somebody else. Gardiner wrote that, while she never met Hellman, she had often heard about her from a friend, Wolf Schwabacher, who was Hellman's lawyer. In Gardiner's account, Schwabacher had visited Gardiner in Vienna and, after Muriel Gardiner and Joseph Buttinger moved into their house at Brookdale Farm in Pennington, New Jersey, in 1940, the house was divided in two with the Gardiner-Buttingers living in one half and Wolf and Ethel Schwabacher in the other for more than ten years.Muriel Gardiner, Code Name \\"Mary\\": Memoirs of an American Woman in the Austrian Underground (Yale University Press, 1983), xv-xvi Most people believed that Hellmann based her story on Gardiner's life. Gardiner's editor cited the unlikelihood that there were two millionaire American women who were medical students and anti-Nazi activists in Vienna in the late 1930s. Personal life and death Her first husband was British artist Julian Gardiner; they had a daughter, Constance, who she raised in Vienna before sending her to New York City to live with her sister, Dr. Ruth Morris Bakwin, a pediatrician married to Dr. Harry Bakwin.

Most of the films starred the Danish performer Bodil Joensen. History In the early 1980s, during the British home video boom, a videocassette of indeterminate origin began to circulate in underground circles that became known simply as Animal Farm. It contained a plotless series of extremely graphic scenes of zoophilia, including acts of intercourse and fellatio performed with pigs, horses and even chickens (\\"avisodomy\\"), as well as a scene in which a woman inserts live eels into her vagina. To this day, Animal Farm remains one of the most notorious and controversial videotapes ever to find its way to British shores.The Real Animal Farm; The Dark Side of Porn, Channel 4 Documentary The material that constitutes the Animal Farm bootleg was apparently smuggled through British Customs in the Spring of 1981 by a tourist. It found its way under the counters of various Soho stockists and was eventually prosecuted following a series of police raids -- but not before countless bootlegs had gone into circulation. It was discovered that the video actually comprised several short X-rated films from the Danish company Color Climax Corporation, which had been producing a steady stream of extreme pornography since the Danish government made all pornography legal in 1969. To keep up with the growing demand for video titles, Color Climax had taken to transferring their stocks of 8 mm and 16 mm animal films onto cassette, and it was these films -- mostly starring Bodil Joensen -- that composed the Animal Farm video, hence its generic title (which at no point appears on the screen) and shadowy origins. It is possible that some of the material was taken from Alex de Renzy's 1971 cash-in feature Animal Lover, which actually managed a brief cinema run in the liberal atmosphere of San Francisco, and whose entire second half consists of the \\"distinctively amateurish, shaky, clumsily-shot lurid colour footage\\" familiar to anyone who has seen Animal Farm. TV documentary In April 2006, the UK station Channel 4 screened a 50-minute documentary, The Real Animal Farm, as part of their Dark Side of Porn season. Several interviewees, including David Kerekes (co-author of Killing For Culture and See No Evil), author Phil Tonge, feminist writer Germaine Greer and British pornographer Ben Dover, all confessed to having seen bootlegs of Animal Farm in the 1980s, but were apparently unaware that there was no such film ‚Äì the entity referred to as such was merely a number of existing zoophilia shorts tacked together. Tonge described the owner of the copy he saw as an \\"evil, evil scumbag\\" and recalled how several \\"hard lads\\" either \\"left the room\\" or \\"vomited\\", Dover remarked that owning the bootleg was a useful aid to games of one-upmanship, since nothing could top the on-screen depravity of Joensen and her co-stars, and the normally easy-going Kerekes was moved to remark that \\"there's only so much filth you can wallow in...and I think Animal Farm is pretty much at the bottom of the pit.\\" Its impact on viewers was compared to that of hearing for the first time about the Kennedy assassination. The documentary also told the story of Bodil Joensen, a psychologically traumatised young woman whose brief notoriety as the 'Queen of Bestiality' was followed by a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and prostitution before her death of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 40, and featured an interview with the Danish pornographer Ole Ege. The 1970 documentary A Summerday apparently formed at least some of the content of the Animal Farm bootleg, having been shown at the \\"Wet Dreams\\" pornography film festival beforehand.

It is the largest dam in the Philippines and sixteenth largest in the world (see List of largest dams in the world). It spans the municipalities of San Manuel and San Nicolas, Pangasinan, nearly 200 km north of Metro Manila. The dam impounds a reservoir with a surface area of about 12.8 square kilometers extending North into the municipality of Itogon, Benguet. A gated spillway protects the dam from overtopping. Each wet season, the run-off is stored for later release via water turbines to generate power and irrigate crops. Agno River is the third largest river in the Philippines with a total length of 221 kilometers and a drainage basin at the Project site of 1,225 square kilometers. The river originates in the Cordillera Mountains, initially flows from north to south, divides into several channels in the flat central plain of Luzon and meanders westerly through the provinces of Pangasinan and Tarlac before emptying into the Lingayen Gulf. The dam and its immediate river basin are protected as a forest reserve known as the Lower Agno Watershed Forest Reserve. San Roque Power Corporation (SRPC) financed and constructed the SRMP under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the National Power Corporation (NPC) on a Build- Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. SRPC substantially completed the SRMP at midnight, February 14, 2003, at which time its peaking power, irrigation, flood control and enhanced water quality benefits became available to the surrounding regions, which include the Northwest Luzon Economic Growth Quadrangle. In reality, all but its power benefits have been available since mid-2002 when the dam and spillway were completed. Ownership of the dam and spillway was transferred to NPC upon construction completion, as it contributed funds for the non-power components on behalf of several agencies. SRPC will own and operate the power generating facilities for 25 years, after which their ownership transfers to NPC. Power The SRMP has an installed rated capacity of 435 megawatts (MW). It operates primarily as a peaking plant during periods each day when the electrical output of base and inter-mediate load power plants cannot fulfill consumer demand. Capacity of 85 MW, which is the basis for the capacity payments under the PPA. The balance is surplus power that reduces dependence on imported fuel oil and also lowers the variable operating expenses of other power plants. The SRMP offers substantial power benefits in addition to the peaking capacity and energy considered in the economic analysis conducted by NPC and the National Economic Development Authority. Most of these benefits are unique to large hydroelectric facilities. Irrigation The SRMP can provide year-round irrigation benefits for 708 square kilometres of farmland downstream of the dam with a partially diversified crop during the dry season, mostly in Pangasinan, but including parts of Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. Flood control The SRMP produces a marked attenuation (reduction) in the perennial flooding of the Agno River affecting at least 16 Pangasinan and Tarlac towns. It is complemented by the 3-phase, PhP9.7 billion Agno Flood Control Project managed by DPWH. Phase I is completed; Phase II is in progress; and Phase III will begin in 2004 and be completed in 2009. Water quality The SRMP improves the quality of the water in the Lower Agno River via a proactive integrated watershed management plan (IWMP) and by trapping sediments caused by erosion and by such other sources as small-scale mining.

These events became one of the most celebrated English criminal mysteries of the 18th century, and a cause c√©l√®bre at the time. Magistrate and author Henry Fielding was consulted on the matter. Mother Well's house was opposite the Sun and Woolpack public house, formerly the Sun and Punchbowl. The United society, the first friendly society, began to meet in the Sun and Woolpack inn, Enfield Wash, in 1794. The road crosses Turkey Brook at the Woolpack Bridge, where there was a footbridge from the 17th century, but it was not until 1821 that a proper bridge for carts was provided by the Turnpike Trust that managed Enfield Highway. The road at Enfield Wash, and the settlement, was known as '‚ÄòHorsepoolstones‚Äô until the 18th century. Turkey Brook was also known as Maiden Brook and sometimes Wash Brook. According to legend, Bell Lane is haunted by a phantom coach. It is reputed to appear on moonless nights before Christmas, and to travel several feet above the road.

It stood for many years just north of High Barnet on Hadley Green. History Though there is a belief that Hadley Brewery started around 1700, the operation probably started in the later part of the 18th century. Robert and William Thorp were listed as brewers in Hadley in Pigot's Directory (1825). The Brewery was run by a Mr Salisbury in the 1850s, who sold it to W. T. Healey early in 1861, who in turn had the whole reconstructed \\"at great expence.\\" James Harris Brown purchased the brewery in 1887, and was successful enough to rebuild the whole in 1911, creating the structure that existed into living memory. Shortly before James Harris died the works became a private limited company (Harris Browne Ltd). During the 1930s the brewery owned the Star Tavern (High Barnet), the Victoria (Highgate), and the Bridge House (Potters Bar). Brookman‚Äôs Park Hotel was planned in 1936 but was not built until after the takeover of the brewery by Fremlin's. The brewery was supplied by its own artesian well, and by 1937 they were brewing approximately 1500 barrels of beer at a cost ¬£12/6s, importing hops from Czechoslovakia. At this time there were approximately fifty employees. Brewing continued at the location until 1938 when the company was sold to Fremlins. Afterwards, the brewery was only used for storage and distribution. There was a serious fire in 1969 and although much of the brewery was rebuilt, the 18th century buildings did not survive. In 1967 Fremlins was bought out by Whitbread, who closed Hadley Brewery completely, offering the 28 employees work at their new works in Luton. The buildings remained empty until 1978 when the last of the buildings were demolished. Products Beers brewed included Hadley Stout, Hadley Special Pale Ale, Dinner Ale, ginger beer, and Nourishing Stout. Twenty to thirty barrels of barley wine (Old English Ale) were made every year and bottled by hand.

Reverse osmosis is a common process to purify or desalinate contaminated water by forcing water through a membrane. Water produced by reverse osmosis may be used for a variety of purposes, including desalination, wastewater treatment, concentration of contaminants, and the reclamation of dissolved minerals. An average modern reverse osmosis plant needs six kilowatt-hours of electricity to desalinate one cubic metre of water. The process also results in an amount of salty briny waste. The challenge for these plants is to find ways to reduce energy consumption, use sustainable energy sources, improve the process of desalination and to innovate in the area of waste management to deal with the waste. Self-contained water treatment plants using reverse osmosis, called reverse osmosis water purification units, are normally used in a military context.  System Operation  Reverse osmosis plants require a variety of pre-treatment techniques including softening, dechlorination, and anti-scalent treatment. Following pre-treatment, high levels of pressure send water through a semi-permeable membrane, which retains all contaminants but lets pure water pass through. Energy requirements depend on the concentration of salts and contaminants in the influent water; higher concentrations requires more energy to treat. In operation In 1977 Cape Coral, Florida became the first municipality in the United States to use the RO process on a large scale with an initial operating capacity of 11,356 m¬≥ (3 million gallons) per day. By 1985, due to the rapid growth in population of Cape Coral, the city had the largest low pressure reverse osmosis plant in the world, capable of producing 56,782 m¬≥ (15 million gallons) per day.http://www.capecoral.net/department/utilities_department/docs/2012_Citywide_CCR.pdf In Israel at Ashkelon on the Mediterranean coast, the world's largest reverse osmosis plant is producing 396,000 m¬≥ of water a day at around possibly $0.50 USD per m¬≥. In western Saudi Arabia at Yanbu, production started in 1999 at 106,904 m¬≥ of water a day. Later in 2009 with some expansion the production reached to 132,000 m¬≥ of water a day.http://www.swcc.gov.sa/default.asp?pid=96#w3 In Sindh Province Pakistan the provincial government has installed 382 reverse osmosis plants in the province out of which 207 are installed in backward areas of Sindh which includes districts of Thar, Thatta, Badin, Sukkur, Shaheed, Benazirabad, Noshero, Feroz, and others while 726 are on the final stage of their completion. In China a desalination plant was planned for Tianjin in 2010, to produce 100,000 m¬≥ of desalinated seawater a day.http://www.nitto.com/dpage/5.html In Spain in 2004, 20 reverse osmosis plants were planned to be built along the Costas, expecting to meet slightly over 1% of Spain's total water needs.http://www.technologyreview.com/microsites/spain/water/index.aspx Nearly 17% of drinking water in Perth, Australia comes from a reverse osmosis plant that desalinates sea water. Perth is an ideal candidate for reverse osmosis plants as it has a relatively dry and arid climate where conventional freshwater resources are scarce, yet it is surrounded by ocean. Western Australia‚Äôs Water Corporation announced the Perth desalination plant in April 2005. At the time, it was the largest desalination plant using reverse osmosis technology in the southern hemisphere.

The film was released in Colombia in 2005. In that same year the film had its North American premiere at the American Film Institute festival in Hollywood. The film was also nominated for a Goya Award for best foreign film. Rosario Tijeras is reportedly the second highest- grossing film in Colombian history.  Plot  The movie, based on a novel by Jorge Franco, deals with the life of a beautiful woman involved with the subculture of sicarios, the motorcycle-riding hitmen of the slums of Medell√≠n, Colombia, in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Rosario, a dangerous woman who was molested and raped as a child, and now claiming to be owned by no man, lives a life on the edge while trying to come to terms with her past and the men in her life, not making the best choices along the way. The film is told in flashback from the point of view of Antonio, a young man from the upper class of Medell√≠n. While at a Medell√≠n disco one night, both he and his best friend, Emilio, simultaneously lay eyes upon the beautiful Rosario. Emilio pursues her and begins an affair with her, despite knowing that she is involved with drug cartel leaders, and despite getting entangled in her violent life. However, Emilio's family rejects the relationship, which crushes Emilio. Antonio continues his own platonic relationship with Rosario as her confidante. When Rosario's brother, Johnefe, with whom Rosario lives, is killed, Antonio and Rosario grow closer. All along, Rosario starts falling in an spiral of drugs and violence, dragging both Emilio and Antonio with her. Rosario, who often kisses the men she then kills, is a marked woman, and she eventually meets her comeuppance. Antonio takes her to the emergency room, from where he relates her story.

Telefutura broadcast the series in the United States from July 12, 2010 to October 4, 2010 after replacing Las mu√±ecas de la mafia. Mar√≠a Fernanda Y√©pez, a Colombian actress, stars as Rosario Tijeras in the TV series. Currently, Telefutura's successor, Unim√°s, is rebroadcasting the novela in place of the recently cancelled ¬øQui√©n Eres T√∫?. The TV series tells the story of Rosario Tijeras (Maria Fernanda Yepez), a woman raised in a slum that was 18 years old when she was raped by a local gang, and which causes her to change for the better after her classmate was killed by a drug lord, El Papa. Rosario avenges her rape by cutting El Cache's testes with scissors (hence the name, Rosario Tijerias) and purposely goes to the market of her stepfather to get picked up to go to El Papa's house so she can execute her plan. Once Rosario is alone in his bedroom, she grabs a gun he hid in a cabinet and kills him behind a pillow. After news spreads she killed El Papa, Rosario Tijeras gains notoriety and is sought out by El Rey De Los Cielos (The King of the Heavens) to become an assassin. Along the way, she has a stormy love affair with her two inseparable friends from wealthy families, Antonio de Bedout (Andres Sandoval) and Emilio Echegaray (Sebasti√°n Mart√≠nez). The story takes a five-year jump from 1999 to 2004, where Rosario meets Emilio at a nightclub after she killed a target. Antonio notices her for the first time in five years and seeks to be with her once again. Their lives are separated by Rosario, which traps them and takes them to a world full of dangers, where she is a victim and instrument of death and they receive a deadly fate thanks in part to a woman they loved before Rosario, Paula Restrepo, who seeks to destroy Rosario for ruining her love life and at the end she is left without her best friend and husband. Rosario pays the ultimate price when she kills the brother of El Rey, El Teo, who killed her brother (Jhonefe), her close friend (Ferney) who tried to kill her by Teo's orders, her unborn baby in a shootout, and Emilio at the cemetery. Rosario and Antonio plan their escape to Spain but are stopped short by El Rey's men who fulfill his orders and kill both.

He also represented the Welsh national team over 30 times and is regarded as one of Wales' best ever players. Brought up in the Rhondda Valley, Paul became a miner after leaving school, but an offer of a professional contract from Swansea gave him the opportunity to leave the colliery. His football career was then disrupted by Second World War, during which he was a physical training instructor. After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948‚Äì49. Transfer listed after an abortive move to Colombian club Millonarios, Paul joined Manchester City for ¬£19,500 in June 1950. At Manchester City Paul spent seven years as captain, leading the club to successive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956, losing the first and winning the second. In 1957 he became player-manager of Worcester City, and subsequently wound down his career in his native South Wales, becoming a lorry driver. He died in 2002 aged 82. Club career =Early career= Paul was born on 18 April 1920 in Ton Pentre, Glamorgan, in the valleys of South Wales, and was one of 12 children. He attended Bronllwyn School in Gelli. Paul left school at 15, and like many boys from the Rhondda Valley he became a miner. While playing football for Ton Boys Club he was spotted by Swansea Town, for whom he signed first as an amateur, and then a month later as a professional. The Swansea captain was Bill Imrie, a former Scotland international. Paul named Imrie as a strong influence in his early career, particularly for instructing him in the fundamentals of good wing-half play.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 17. Paul played for Swansea's junior sides, but just as he was approaching the fringes of the first team, the league was suspended due to the outbreak of the Second World War. At the start of the war Paul returned to the mines. He continued to represent Swansea in wartime leagues, and played for the senior team for the first time in 1939.A Red Dragon of Wales, pp. 17‚Äì18. Paul struggled to readapt to mining life, and volunteered for the Marines in 1940.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 18. He served as a sergeant physical training instructor, primarily in Devon, though he also spent part of the war in India.Maddox, Saffer and Robinson, Manchester City Cup Kings 1956, p. 69. When in Devon he played football as a guest for Exeter City, and when in Wales he played wartime football for Swansea. Once the war was over Paul finally made his League debut for Swansea, having lost six years of his career to the war. The Swansea coach in the immediate post-war period was Frank Barson, a notoriously aggressive character who was known as \\"the centre-forward's graveyard\\" in his playing days.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 20. Barson instructed Paul in the art of tackling during lengthy practise sessions, and made him aware of the tricks that a wily opponent could use to gain the upper hand in a physical battle.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 21. Paul went on to make 159 league appearances for Swansea in a four-year period, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948‚Äì49. An impressive appearance against top-flight club Arsenal in a 1950 FA Cup match resulted in the Londoners making an offer for the player, but Swansea turned it down. Later that year, Paul received an offer of a trial with Colombian club Millonarios. Colombian clubs, who were not required to pay transfer fees as their governing body was not affiliated with FIFA, made similar offers to several British players. Paul was one of seven to make the trip to South America. Millonarios offered him a ¬£3,000 signing on fee and ¬£150 per month, far in excess of the ¬£12 per week maximum wage in British football. The maximum wage was set at ¬£12 in 1947, and raised to ¬£14 in 1951. Once in Colombia, Paul found himself unimpressed by the conditions. He remarked in his autobiography that seeing football pitches surrounded by barbed wire put him in mind of \\"a concentration camp, or maybe the monkey-house in the zoo\\".A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 26. Paul stayed in Bogota for only ten days, without playing a single match.Moving with the Ball, p. 61. Swansea were angered by Paul's trip, and transfer-listed him upon his return.Manchester City Greats, p. 40. As a result, he transferred to Manchester City for ¬£19,500, a British record for a half-back. Ken Barnes joined the club on the same day. The two became close friends; Paul was best man at Barnes' wedding. =Manchester City= Paul joined a Manchester City side which had just been relegated to the Second Division, and were thus playing at the same level as Swansea. Paul made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 1950‚Äì51 season, a 4‚Äì2 victory against a Preston North End side featuring Tom Finney.The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 118. Manchester City went ten matches unbeaten at the start of the season, until a 4‚Äì3 defeat at Doncaster Rovers, where City blew a 3‚Äì0 half-time lead. Paul played in all but one match that season, becoming club captain and helping his club win promotion, as runners-up behind champions Preston. Writer HD Davies, under his pen name Old International, attributed much of City's cohesive play over the season to the addition of Paul to the side. Promotion meant Paul was playing club football at the highest level for the first time. For the next three seasons, his club languished in the lower reaches of the league table. During one spell of particularly poor form in 1953, newspapers wrote of a feud between Paul and his team-mate Ivor Broadis. Paul was critical of Broadis, a talented inside-forward, but one who in Paul's view did not exert sufficient effort when defending.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 57. In the 1954‚Äì55 pre-season a new tactic was introduced which would change the direction of the club. Inspired by the Hungary team which had beaten England 6‚Äì3 the previous year, the club's reserves had used a tactical system in which Johnny Williamson was used as a deep-lying centre-forward, resulting in a lengthy unbeaten run. p. 131. Manchester City manager Les McDowall decided to try the system at first team level, using Don Revie in the centre-forward role. Henceforth the system became known as The Revie Plan. The opening match of the season resulted in a 5‚Äì0 defeat at the hands of Preston North End. The following match the system was tweaked with Ken Barnes picked in place of John McTavish.Trautmann: The Biography, p. 159. City beat Sheffield United 5‚Äì2, and the system was retained for the remainder of the season. Paul's tactical role was relatively unchanged compared to that of some of his team-mates, but as captain he was responsible for retaining the cohesion of his players. The Manchester Guardian regarded Paul to be well suited to the system, calling it \\"a strategy which shows off to perfection the strength and maturity of Paul among his younger defenders\\". Using the new system, results improved. In September 1954 City beat Arsenal to go top of the league, though not without personal cost for Paul, as an elbow from Arsenal's Tommy Lawton resulted in the loss of four teeth.Manchester City Greats, p. 45. City could not sustain their title challenge, finishing seventh, but Paul's team enjoyed a successful run in the FA Cup, reaching the final, where they faced Newcastle United. An early goal by Jackie Milburn and an unfortunate injury to Jimmy Meadows on 18 minutes left City playing with 10 men and gave them an uphill task. Paul took the responsibility of changing tactics: \\"Like certain generals I believe that in dire emergency it is often better to attack. I clapped my hands and yelled \\"Let's show these Geordies the stuff that's taken us to Wembley\\"\\".The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 121. The performance in the remainder of the first half was improved, resulting in an equalising goal by Bobby Johnstone, but in the second half Newcastle scored twice to win 3‚Äì1. Publicly, Paul vowed to take his team to Wembley again, but privately he blamed himself for the defeat, questioning whether he had failed as captain. The following season the club surpassed the achievements of the previous season, finishing fourth in the league and again reaching the FA Cup final, this time facing Birmingham City. Conscious that early nerves had affected his team in 1955, in the dressing room he focussed on instilling each member of his team with confidence.The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p120 This time it was Manchester City who scored an early goal, and with City leading in the second half Paul told his men to keep the ball in play as much as possible in order to tire out the Birmingham players. Then German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann badly hurt his neck in a collision with Peter Murphy. Paul instructed Roy Little to take Trautmann's place, but Trautmann insisted that he would keep playing. Then Manchester City held on for the victory, and Paul collected the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II. X-rays later revealed that Trautmann had played on with a broken neck. Paul took the match ball from the final as a souvenir, and gave it to his son.Maddox, Saffer and Robinson, Manchester City Cup Kings 1956, p. 59. After the cup win Paul played one more season for Manchester City. In the summer of 1957 he was offered a new contract, but instead retired from the professional game aged 37, citing loss of pace due to age as the deciding factor.Manchester City Greats, p. 49. His final appearance for the club came on 22 April 1957 against Everton.Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 380. In total he made 293 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 9 goals. Upon finishing his professional career, Paul returned to the Rhondda Valley, and settled in Gelli. He continued to play at semi-professional level, joining Worcester City, who paid him ¬£20 a week and loaned him a car. Paul made 124 appearances for Worcester between 1957 and 1960, including a three-month spell as player- manager. In 1959 he was part of the Worcester side which knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup. He then moved to Brecon Corinthians, and later Garw Athletic, where he ended his career. Post-playing life After the end of his football career, he became a lorry driver.The Manchester City Story, p. 45. He died on 21 May 2002 in Treorchy aged 82, following a long illness with Alzheimer's disease, leaving a wife, Beryl, and two children, Robert and Christine. He is buried in Treorchy Cemetery. International career Paul gained 33 caps for Wales. He did not gain any under-age caps, as in his era Wales did not field an under-23 team.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 65. He received his first cap in October 1948, in a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Scotland. His only international goal came in a 5‚Äì1 win against Belgium in November 1949. In October 1955 Paul was part of the Wales team that beat England 2‚Äì1, the first Welsh victory against England in 18 years.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 71. Six months later Wales faced Ireland in their final match of that season's British Home Championship. Wales were leading 1‚Äì0 when a handball by Danny Blanchflower gave Wales a penalty. Paul took the kick, but it was saved by Norman Uprichard. Paul's failure cost Wales victory, as Jimmy Jones equalised in the second half and the match finished 1‚Äì1.A Red Dragon of Wales, pp. 73‚Äì74. A draw in the remaining fixture between Scotland and England meant that the miss also denied Wales victory in the tournament. Instead, for the first and only time there was a four-way tie. Paul did not play for Wales again.Wales: The Complete Who's Who of Footballers Since 1946 Playing style Roy Paul played as a half-back, with the exact position varying during his career. At Swansea he was primarily used as a right-half, but when he joined Manchester City manager Les McDowall switched him to the left, a position which Paul preferred despite being right- footed.Manchester City Greats, p. 41. Internationally, he represented Wales in all three half-back positions over the course of his career. Paul had a reputation as a physically tough player and inspirational captain. Team-mate Ken Barnes described him as a player who was \\"more about power than guile\\", and called him a \\"born leader\\" who was \\"brilliant in the air\\".This Simple Game, p. 44. Paul's approach to captaincy was to ensure that every player gave as much effort as possible,The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 124. mixing the respect of his colleagues with the occasional attempt to frighten them into action; in the tunnel prior to the 1956 FA Cup Final his last action before leading out his team was to hold up his fist and shout \\"If we don't fucking win, you'll get some of this\\". At Manchester City he was occasional penalty taker, but his success rate was not high and he was relieved when Don Revie joined the club and took the responsibility for penalties, commenting that \\"the only reason I took them was because no-one else fancied it\\".Manchester City Greats, p. 42.

The route runs from Route 29 on the border of Pekin and North Pekin east to Interstate 155 (I-155) in Morton. The highway connects Pekin, North Pekin, Morton, and the community of Groveland; it passes through a variety of landscapes between the towns. Route 98 is maintained by the Illinois Department of Transportation. The state of Illinois created Route 98 in 1924; the original route connected several cities in western Illinois. The eastern section of this route appeared on maps by 1928, and the highway was completed in 1929. In 1939, Route 98 moved to its current alignment; it has not changed since.  Route description  Route 98 begins at an intersection with Route 29 on the border of Pekin and North Pekin; Worley Lake and the Illinois River lie to the west. The route heads east as a divided two-lane road called Edgewater Drive, passing a group of houses which lie between two small lakes. After entering North Pekin, the highway becomes undivided and runs through a business district. It intersects County Route 25, known locally as Parkway Road, before crossing into Pekin. Route 98 enters a forested area in Pekin and passes to the north of John T. McNaughton Park near the city's eastern border. After leaving Pekin, Route 98 passes through farmland in unincorporated Groveland Township. The highway meets Cole Hollow Road and California Road at successive intersections in a residential area. Past a creek, the road heads into a rural area with sections of farmland and forest. As it enters Groveland, the highway intersects County Route 1, which runs south through the community. Route 98 leaves Groveland to the east, running through another farmed area. The route curves into Morton and takes the name Birchwood Street, traversing a creek before entering an industrial district. In this area, Route 98 briefly becomes a divided highway before terminating at exit 31 on I-155. The road continues past the terminus as a local street, still carrying the name Birchwood Street. Route 98 is maintained by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), an Illinois state agency responsible for maintaining highways and other transport infrastructure in the state. IDOT is responsible for collecting traffic data on Illinois state highways; this data is measured in terms of annual average daily traffic, an estimate of the number of vehicles which use a road on any given day in a particular year. In 2009, IDOT estimated that 4400 vehicles used the western portion of Route 98, 3900 used the central portion, and 3700 used the eastern portion. No part of Route 98 is included in the National Highway System, a network of roads considered significant to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.  History  =Original Route 98= Route 98 was initially designated in 1924 on a route in western Illinois. The state planned the road to connect Route 3 east of Macomb to Route 95 near Havana by way of Adair, Table Grove, Ipava, and Duncan Mills. The route was first marked on the 1928 Illinois highway map; at this point, the road connected Table Grove in the west to U.S. Route 24 (US 24) and Route 31 at Duncans Mills in the east. By 1929, the highway's western terminus was extended to Route 9 east of Macomb. The original Route 98 in Western Illinois route became part of Route 10 between 1936 and 1939. The original Route 98 is now part of US 136. =Renumbering= When the Route 98 designation was dropped in Western Illinois between 1936 and 1939, it was reused for the present alignment, the former Route 9 between Pekin and Morton, and the Route 9 designation was itself shifted south onto the former Route 164 through Tremont.

After the split within the church in 1844, he continued as a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Early life Andrew was born on May 3, 1794 in the township of Washington in Wilkes County, Georgia, a son of the Rev. John and Mary Cosby Andrew. Rev. John Andrew was the first native Georgian to enter the Methodist ministry. Ordained ministry James Andrew was licensed to preach in 1812 in Eliam Methodist Episcopal Church in the South Carolina Annual Conference of the M.E. Church. The first twenty years of his ministry included appointments to the Salt Ketcher Circuit in South Carolina, the Bladen Circuit in North Carolina, and the Augusta and Savannah circuits in Georgia. In 1824 Andrew was appointed Presiding Elder of the Edisto District, which included Charleston, South Carolina. He was elected a Delegate to quadrennial M.E. General Conferences from 1820 through 1832. Episcopal ministry Andrew was elected as a Bishop by the 1832 General Conference. He moved from Augusta to Newton County, Georgia to be near the Methodist Manual Labor School, of which he was a Trustee. This institution later developed as Emory College at Oxford, Georgia. His Episcopal assignments also took him to Annual Conferences throughout the south and the west. Controversy over slave ownership Bishop Andrew bought a female slave to save her from a less kind master. He let her hire out her labor and keep her earnings. When he married, his wife brought her personal slave into their household. The bishop's ownership of slaves generated controversy within the M.E. Church, as the national organization had long opposed slavery. He was criticized by the 1844 General Convention and suspended from office. Disputing the authority of the Convention to discipline the bishop, southern members seceded and set up the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Andrew became the symbol of the slavery issue for the M.E. Church. But the details surrounding his ownership of slaves, and how he acquired them, has been disputed. According to most published accounts, Andrew never bought or sold a slave. Rather, he became a slave owner through his wives. In 1816 Andrew married Ann Amelia MacFarlane, with whom he had six children. Upon her death in 1842, she bequeathed him a slave. Andrew's second wife, Leonora Greenwood, whom he married in 1844, was also a slave owner. When she died in 1854, he married Emily Sims Childers. Evidence exists to suggest Andrew may have first acquired slaves earlier than 1842. A James Osgood Andrew is listed as a resident of Athens, Georgia in the 1830 U.S. Census. This Andrew is listed as the owner of two slaves; historians disagree as to whether this was the man who was elected bishop. The 1840 Census lists Bishop Andrew as a resident of Newton County, Georgia and the owner of 13 slaves. A grave marker placed in the Oxford City Cemetery in 1938 by H.Y. McCord tells a different tale. (Locals call it \\"Kitty's Stone.\\") McCord claims that Kitty was a slave girl bequeathed to Bishop Andrew when she was 12 years old by a Mrs. Powers of Augusta Georgia. She stipulated that at 19 years of age, Kitty was to be given her freedom and sent to Liberia, which had been established by the American Colonization Society as a colony for free blacks. When Kitty was 19, Bishop Andrews had Dr. A. B. Longstreet, who was then President of Emory College, and Professor George W. Lane interview her about her wishes. Kitty declined to go to Liberia, saying that she preferred to remain with the Andrews. Under the laws of Georgia at that time, if Bishop Andrew freed Kitty she would have to leave the state. He built a cottage for her in his backyard and told her ‚ÄúYou are as free as I am.‚Äù Kitty lived in that cottage as a free woman until she married Nathan Shell. M.E. custom (especially among clergy of the North) was that clergy should not own slaves, no matter how acquired. A growing abolitionist movement was evident within Methodism. At the 1844 General Conference some delegates thought the larger issue was whether the M.E. Church would finally rule on the acceptance of slavery. Founded in opposition, its missionaries in the South had first encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves. By this time, ministers had come to accommodations in order to influence southern planters, and argued for paternal protection and improved treatment of slaves. Northern delegates to the 1844 General Conference sponsored a resolution asking Bishop Andrew to \\"desist\\" from exercising the Episcopal office so long as he owned slaves. Southern delegates countered that the Church would be destroyed in the many southern states that prohibited emancipation. The resolution passed by a vote of 110 to 69. This resulted in a Plan of Separation between northern and southern Methodists. The next year representatives of the Southern Annual Conferences met in Louisville, Kentucky to organize their own denomination. The first General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South met in Petersburg, Virginia in 1846, and Andrew was invited to preside. Later years Bishop Andrew presided as the Senior Bishop of his denomination from 1846 until his death. He led the Southern ministers of the church in dividing from the main church over the issue of slavery in 1846, and became the first bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65), he resided in Summerfield, Alabama. Andrew was a founding trustee of Central University, a Methodist university, in 1858. It was renamed Vanderbilt University in 1872. After his retirement in 1866, he continued to conduct church conferences as his health permitted. He died in 1871 at the home of a daughter and son-in-law, the Rev. and Mrs. J.W. Rush, in Mobile, Alabama. He was buried in Oxford. Andrew College in Cuthbert, Georgia is named for him.

Background The song is named after Bron-Yr-Aur, a house in Gwynedd, Wales, where the members of Led Zeppelin retreated in 1970 to write much of Led Zeppelin III after having completed a concert tour of North America.Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, .Phil Sutcliffe, \\"Back to Nature\\", Q Magazine Special Led Zeppelin edition, 2003, p. 34.

The cottage had no electricity or running water, but the change of scenery provided inspiration for many of the songs on the album, including \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\". Composition and recording Jimmy Page and Robert Plant wrote \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" in 1970. It is a country music-inflected hoedown, with lyrics about walking in the woods with Plant's blue-eyed Merle dog named Strider. Plant reportedly named his dog after Aragorn (often called Strider) from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. However, there are no explicit references to Tolkien works in \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\". The group recorded the song at Headley Grange in 1970, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. They completed it at Island Studios in London, and Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. Reflecting the rustic nature of their retreat, the song is largely acoustic. Guitarist Jimmy Page used a Martin D-28 guitar, drummer John Bonham played spoons and castanets, and bassist John Paul Jones played a double bass. Jennings Farm Blues Led Zeppelin also recorded the song as an electric blues rock instrumental, \\"Jennings Farm Blues\\", a rough mix of which later surfaced as a studio out-take on a number of Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings. Jennings Farm is the name of the property at Blakeshall on which the Plant family stayed in the early 1970s. \\"Jennings Farm Blues\\" was released on 2 June 2014, as part of the remastering process of all nine albums.

Privately held and poorly run for two years, the City Brewery was purchased by an investment group in 1883. The investment group was composed of local businessmen and several moguls already involved in brewing at San Antonio's other major brewery, the Lone Star Brewing Company. Together they formed the San Antonio Brewing Company (1883‚Äì1888), and began to raise capital to fully restart and improve operations at the brewery.The Pearl Brewing Company TexasBreweries.com. July 23, 2008. Accessed on November 11, 2008. In 1886, after three years, the company had secured the necessary capital and began full-time operations at the brewery again. The name San Antonio Brewing Association was used as a parent to the brewing company, since it also managed some of the founding members' other business interests. Functionally, the business structure worked, but it caused confusion with city officials, customers, and business partners; therefore, in the end, the investment group dissolved the San Antonio Brewing Company and used the San Antonio Brewing Association (1888‚Äì1918) name for all operations and business transactions. Thus, in seven years, the same brewery had three different names.Pearl Brewing Company Tavern Trove. January 15, 2007. Accessed on November 11, 2008. In addition, the name City Brewery was frequently used. The first logos used for the San Antonio Brewing Company/Association even featured the name City Brewery in the logo. City Brewery was carried over from the Behloradsky days and was used until the beginning of Prohibition in 1918. During these name changes, the brewery found the product that would become their signature brew. Pearl beer was formulated and first brewed in Bremen, Germany, by the Kaiser‚ÄìBeck Brewery, which produces Beck's beer. Pearl beer's name came from Kaiser‚ÄìBeck's brewmaster, who thought the foamy bubbles in a freshly poured glass of the brew resembled sparkling pearls.Sanford, Nowlin. Plant a part of Brewing History. San Antonio Express News. April 22, 2000. In Germany, the brew was called \\"Perle\\". When brought to the United States, the spelling was changed to English: Pearl.

Legend has it that by sitting on his porch, Koehler could determine whether his employees were hard at work by the smoke color rising up from the brewery's stacks. In 1902, Koehler purchased the property to re-open the since closed Hot Wells hotel, spa, and bathhouse, located on the San Antonio River in the southside of San Antonio. Many celebrities visited Hot Wells in its heyday in their own railroad cars with access by a spur to the resort. The facility was sold in 1923 to a Christian Science group.

January 9, 2008. Accessed on November 13, 2008. With the tremendous production increase, the San Antonio Brewing Association was able to outpace the Lone Star Brewing Company to become the largest Texas brewery and the beer America most widely associated with Texas and the West. During the early 20th century, Pearl used advertisement campaigns that featured Judge Roy Bean - one of the more colorful and popular law enforcement personalities of the wild, wild West. =Prohibition= Prohibition ends at midnight and Pearl beer legally flows once more Prior to Prohibition, Texas was a hot spot for beer production. With a strong German and European influence, small and regional breweries were found throughout the state. San Antonio enjoyed the distinction of having two of Texas‚Äô largest breweries: Lone Star Brewery and the San Antonio Brewing Association. Prohibition, though, changed the face of brewing and forced almost every brewery out of business. When the Volstead Act and Prohibition went into effect on January 16, 1920, Lone Star Brewing Company ended sales, shut the brewery doors, and dissolved the company. Emma Koehler vowed not to let the brewery go under. In late 1919, the San Antonio Brewing Association changed its name to Alamo Industries (1919‚Äì1921) and began operations to comply with Prohibition laws. Times were tough for the brewery and its employees, but the facility stayed open by continuing to produce a near beer called \\"La Perla\\", bottling soft drinks, dry cleaning, operating a small advertising sign division, running a small auto repair shop, and entering the commercial ice and creamery businesses. Being so diverse brought in cash for the company, but it also meant Alamo Industries did not acquire expertise in any one area. As a result, Alamo Industries reorganized their product lines. The company changed its name to the Alamo Foods Company (1921‚Äì1933) and shifted products toward the food specialty. The sections for auto repair, dry cleaning, and advertising were closed or sold off to third parties. Although no solid proof exists, rumors abound that Alamo Foods used the old brewery equipment for more than \\"La Perla\\", and that, in fact, the brewery still bottled a tiny amount of the real Pearl and Texas Pride for close friends and sale on the black market. One thing is certain, though: when the Blaine Act ended Prohibition at midnight on September 15, 1933, within minutes, 100 trucks and 25 railroad boxcars loaded with beer rolled out of the brewery grounds. =After Prohibition= Cases of Pearl being flown to customers after Prohibition With the end of Prohibition, so too came the end of the Alamo Foods Company. The company went back to their prior name: San Antonio Brewing Association (1933‚Äì1952). Most believed beer production would quickly return to the levels before the 1920 ban. However, Pearl's hard times were not over yet. In 1933, the nation was still deep in the grips of the Great Depression. Although most of the public would have loved to enjoy a Pearl, the financial situation of most made buying beer an unaffordable luxury. Through her skillful management, Emma Koehler kept the brewery afloat through the Depression, selling beer to those who could afford it and continuing many of the business ventures that had carried the brewery through Prohibition. As the Great Depression ended in the United States, world affairs worsened and spun the globe toward World War II. After almost 26 years at the helm of the San Antonio Brewing Association, Emma Koehler decided it was time to relinquish the official title. Her ‚Äúretirement‚Äù closed an amazing chapter in the brewery's history. While it may not seem much these days, Emma's successful management role at Pearl was a breakthrough for its day. At a time when women's suffrage was still in its infancy and women did not yet have the right to vote, Emma Koehler led Texas‚Äô largest brewery and one of the larger breweries in the nation. Emma did not fade quietly into the history books, however. For years after her retirement, she remained an important part of brewery operations. While she did not have voting powers with the San Antonio Brewing Association, she typically had the final word on all large deals or changes. Emma's successor depended on her heavily after the transition and during the brewery's changes to meet the effort of World War II. =The return of Otto Koehler= Otto and Emma Koehler's lives were filled with helping others and improving the community through various organizations and corporations. Otto and Emma never had children in their long marriage, but their extended family was huge. A large portion of their substantial wealth was spent on helping their families immigrate to the United States from their homeland in Germany. The Koehlers paid for family members' passage to New York and travel expenses to their city of choice, which was usually San Antonio or close proximity. Once relocated, the Koehlers helped set them up with housing and a job at the brewery or one of the other Koehler-owned companies. One family the Koehlers helped was Otto's twin brother, Karl Koehler. Karl and his wife moved to Pennsylvania, where they had two boys. The older of the two boys was named after Otto. Born on July 24, 1893, as a youngster Otto A. and his younger brother were taken to Europe by their parents for what was supposed to be a short trip. On the trip however, Karl became seriously ill and decided to stay in Germany. In 1908, when Otto A. was just 15, his father finally succumbed to his illnesses and died. Otto A. returned to America and became a ward of his uncle Otto and aunt Emma. Otto A. developed a special bond with Otto and Emma, who treated him as a son. In 1921, Otto A. left his other jobs to come to the brewery to assist Emma in daily operations. When Emma decided it was time to step aside of her post, the board members and Emma picked Otto A. to be her successor. Emma served as Otto's advisor during the transition and his first years as head of the brewery, a position she held until her death on April 26, 1943.Koehler Burial Records. Accessed January 12, 2007. Although the Koehlers did not own the brewery, after the first Otto, his wife Emma, and now Otto A., the family was very much considered the owners not only by the community, but the brewery board members and workers alike. Otto A. was a strong leader and businessman who had learned much from his aunt and uncle. It was this strength that he would have to draw on as turbulent times lay ahead for the brewery and beer brewing industry as a whole. =Power struggle= Through the 1940s, operations at Pearl continued at a steady pace. Pearl was well established as the largest brewer in Texas, even though Lone Star beers had adopted the slogan proclaiming Lone Star the national beer of Texas.History The Lone Star Brewery. October 11, 2008. Accessed on November 23, 2008. Pearl, as a company, did its part in the war effort, reducing can production to save on metals and producing generic beer for the troops abroad. At the end of the war, Pearl reestablished its aggressive growth drive and shifted marketing to focus on the emerging power buyer, the postwar housewife.Wolff, Elaine. Strange Brew. San Antonio Current. November 5, 2003. Production and market-wise, the 1950s were similar to the late 1940s. In the early '50s, the San Antonio Brewing Association felt they needed to increase the association of their number one product, Pearl lager beer, with the company itself. In marketing research, the association found that most consumers believed the San Antonio Brewing Association encompassed more than a single brewery; in fact, the public thought San Antonio Brewing Association referred to all brewing in San Antonio in general. Therefore, in 1952 the San Antonio Brewing Association changed its name to the Pearl Brewing Company (1952‚Äìpresent).Pearl Brewing Company Tavern Trove. January 15, 2007. Accessed on November 22, 2008. Pearl was successful, not only in Texas, but on a national level, as well. Larger companies saw this success and made many attempts to buy out Pearl and their beers. Almost all offers were never even considered. In what would turn out later to be ironic, one company came very close to buying out the Pearl Brewing Company in the 1950s: Pabst Brewing Company. B.B. McGimsey, who was Pearl's plant manager, shareholder, and the face of Pearl at most events, began gaining support to sell the brewery off. McGimsey was a charismatic leader whom most of the employees liked and respected. McGimsey's influence also reached other board members, and when the offer came from Pabst, it was not as easily dismissed. Details of the offer have long been lost, but one can surmise it was a good deal given the consideration given to it by Pearl. McGimsey believed that Pearl's stance as an independent Texas brewer would never allow them to truly compete on a national level with brewers from St. Louis and Milwaukee. Ultimately, the sale to Pabst was defeated by Otto A. and the other shareholders, but only by the slimmest of margins. Pearl maintained its independence, for now. =Goetz Brewing Company= Although narrowly defeated in the vote to be acquired by Pabst, McGimsey and fellow members of Pearl's board still pushed for change in the company. The predominant theme throughout was growth. The acquisition of Pearl by a larger company was no longer considered, but then how could the company really grow and hope to compete with industry leaders such as Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Pabst? Pearl considered expanding the San Antonio brewery to increase production, but after researching the idea, Pearl realized expanding the brewery could only gain them a nominal production increase and ultimately would not be worth the overall investment. M.K. Goetz Brewing Company logo Otto A. and the board began studying other companies to try to see what innovations or organizational structures were working, and if those changes could be applied to Pearl. Pearl's board noticed that the larger brewers such as Anheuser-Busch were not attempting to push more and more products out of a single brewery; instead, they had several breweries spread out to distribute their products. Pearl seized on the idea of a second brewery and began to explore the options. Location was a huge factor in the considerations. San Antonio's location allowed Pearl to reach both the East and West Coasts equally well. However, San Antonio's southern position was not ideal for reaching places such as Maine or Washington state. One idea was to build a second brewery somewhere in the northern Midwest. Initial studies of this idea proved too costly to be feasible. The price tag of land, permits, zoning, construction, equipment, manpower, and initial operations proved to be too large for Pearl to afford. Pearl could have raised the cash need for the project, but doing so would have extended the company a little too thin, and one misstep or hiccup in sales could force Pearl into bankruptcy. Rather than building a second brewery and potentially putting the company at risk, Pearl decided to purchase an existing brewery to increase production and the distribution network. Overall, buying out another brewery meant a larger initial investment, but the new brewery would be able to put out Pearl beer almost immediately and therefore help recoup costs more quickly. From a short list of potentials, the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, Missouri, seemed the perfect fit for Pearl's plans. Goetz's historic brewery would allow increased production levels and the ability to use the well-established distribution network to help Pearl reach untapped markets. In addition, Pearl gained access to the Goetz line of beers, from pilsners to malt liquors. In 1961, the Pearl Brewing Company officially purchased the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company.M. K. Goetz Brewing Company of Saint Joseph, Missouri, USA Tavern Trove, January 5, 2003. Accessed on October 12, 2008. Overall, the merger of the two companies was a success. Beers from both companies began to be produced at the two facilities. Goetz brewed all of the Pearl beers for easier distribution in the north, and Pearl produced Goetz's Country Club malt liquor. Country Club proved very successful for Pearl, and in fact is the only Goetz beer still in production by Pabst today under the Pearl Brewing Company name. The merger was not without its problems, but overall the transition occurred smoothly. Pearl took over as the corporate headquarters and some duplicate jobs were eliminated. The production side of Goetz remained intact, with Pearl treating Goetz employees just as they did the employees in San Antonio, like family.Pearl Parade Monthly Newsletter. Pearl Parade. June 1, 1961. =Judson Candies: Pearl's sweet tooth= Although Pearl had long dominated the Texas market over Lone Star, that did not stop the rivalry between the two. Each brewery was intent on being known as the brewery of Texas. Competition in the community was fierce, with both companies doing all they could to be associated with any large event. In the 1950s and '60s the competition was at its highest. For San Antonio's week-long festival called Fiesta, each company would sponsor as many floats and events as possible in an attempt to get their name out the most in the public eye. During the annual San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, Lone Star and Pearl would get into bidding wars over the blue ribbon winner of each show-animal category. The two breweries would drive the prices up sometimes triple the animal's worth, all in an attempt to best their rival. The strangest twist to the seemingly endless rivalry involved a small candy company in San Antonio, called Judson Candies. In 1965, the Pearl Brewing Company bought Judson Candies from the three sons whose father had helped found the business.Judson-Atkinson Candies History Judson-Atkinson Candies, January 12, 2006. Accessed on January 2, 2007. On its own, Judson was a profitable company that had an established name in the candy industry. Judson was not on the level of Hershey or Mars, but did have strong sales in the Southwest. Pearl simply made the Judson sons an offer they could not refuse. So, in 1965, Judson Candies joined the Pearl and Goetz families under the umbrella of the Pearl Brewing Company. Judson was part of the company, but in many ways it was still very independent. Financial backing came down from Pearl, but Judson still made decisions on their own, setting their own strategic goals independently of Pearl. Whatever the decisions were at Judson, they obviously worked. From the day Pearl acquired them, until they were sold off to members of the Atkinson's Candy family in 1983, Judson remained a profitable business. When the Atkinsons bought Judson, the only real evidence of ownership by a larger company, and one in a completely different industry, was the office furniture and supplies. Everything in the Judson offices were labeled with \\"Property of the Pearl Brewing Company\\" and items such as pencils, pens, ashtrays, notepads, and even first aid kits were branded with the Pearl logos.Amy Atkinson-Voltz, Judson-Atkinson Candies. Telephone. September 18, 2006. Although profitable and requiring little oversight, an official statement was never given on why Pearl purchased Judson. Other than support for Judson, Pearl never branded their name on any of the candy products, even in an era when it was completely acceptable for celebrities and popular cartoon characters to push adult-oriented items such as alcohol and cigarettes.Lighten Up and Light Up, TVParty.com, February 19, 2005. Accessed on January 1, 2007. From the surface, it makes no sense that a major brewery would enter a completely foreign market to buy a company and support it, yet not use the purchased company in the larger company's goals. It makes no sense at all, that is until one looks at the purchase in the context of the feud between Pearl and Lone Star. In 1949, Mr. Harry Jersig became president of Lone Star, and effectively the nemesis to Otto A. Koehler.Lone Star: Profile , Myspace.com, July 18, 2005. Accessed on January 6, 2007. Through the '50s and '60s, competition between the two was fierce and generated a no-holds-barred mentality. Mr. Jersig had not always been in the brewing industry, and in fact got his start doing something completely different. Mr. Jersig learned the ropes of business while working in the Judson Candies Company for many years. In fact, Jersig worked at Judson so long, that he considered the owners and workers at Judson Candies like family. Decades later in 1965, Jersig's adopted family was purchased by his biggest competitor.About Us Judson-Atkinson Candies, February 20, 2008. Accessed on September 30, 2008.

However, these two attributes, along with another surprise development, actually saved the brewery facilities and helped to ensure its architecture would survive. San Antonio has begun work to expand the River Walk north to where the river meets U.S. Route 281.

Can Recycle's giant can at night May 2006 also had the return of another piece of history to the Pearl Brewery. As the new Pearl Stable opened its doors, Engine #2 of the Texas Transportation Company returned from a complete restoration. Originally built in 1909 as lot #758 by the St. Louis-based St. Louis Car Company, Engine #2 served two Texas-based companies prior to coming to Pearl. Most of its career in use was at the Pearl Brewery after the Texas Transportation Company purchased the engine in 1948. Today, the engine's paint scheme is exactly the one used on the locomotive from the time it arrived at the brewery through the early 1970s. Restored at the country's premier locomotive and passenger car restoration service, the Trans-Texas Rail Shop, Engine #2 is immaculate and one of the few examples of electric locomotives on display.

In fact, it was used at the brewery even before Pearl beer became synonymous with the company. When the San Antonio Brewing Association bought the City Brewery and opened it for business in the 1880s, they used the triple Xs in the brewery's logo. Three large Xs were enclosed in a circle, with the words ‚ÄúCity Brewery‚Äù on both sides or around the outside of the circle. This was the brewery's first logo under the San Antonio Brewing Association, thus it appeared on all of their advertising and the majority of their bottled and kegged beers. With the start of Prohibition, the triple Xs disappeared as the company was forced to transform itself to try to survive. The brewery produced a wide variety of bottled drinks during the beer-less time, including near beer and root beer. Other companies picked up on the use of Xs on their near or root beers, the most famous of which being Triple XXX Root Beer, but Pearl (at that time Alamo Industries/Foods) never used the Xs on any of their products. The Xs were gone from the brewery during Prohibition, but not forgotten. When the ban on beer ended in 1933, the brewery quickly began the production of Pearl and Texas Pride beer once again. Along with their return, the triple Xs returned, as well. The Xs were absent from advertising and the company logo for 15 years after Prohibition, but they held a prominent status on every single bottle. In the late 1940s, the brewery launched an advertising campaign stating the brewery's beers were the ‚ÄúThree xXx of Texas.‚Äù The triple Xs took a renewed and increased role at the brewery, but their growth in prominence did not end there. In 1952, when the San Antonio Brewing Association changed its name to the Pearl Brewing Company, the triple Xs joined the Pearl name as a dominant image on the product and the company as a whole. The triple Xs were back on the company logo and were used on almost all of Pearl's advertisements. The Xs held this significant role to the end of production at the brewery in 2001, when the brewery closed its doors and the company logo was abandoned. As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned. The updated label does not use the triple Xs, so a significant part of company identity has been virtually eliminated from the Pearl beers. However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo. Many people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through. The triple Xs were adopted by the San Antonio Brewing Association to portray two things: the high quality of their beers, and the pride that workers put into their products. The triple Xs may be gone from company and Pearl beer logos, but it has not completely vanished. In the 1960s, Pearl absorbed the Goetz Brewing Company and made Country Club Malt Liquor one of Pearl's key products. When Country Club received its only product makeover a few years after the buyout, it gained the triple Xs in its logo. The Xs were situated in the top-center of the logo's crown. Country Club is still produced today, and it still carries the ‚ÄúxXx‚Äù mark of Pearl. In 2006, the triple Xs made a huge comeback. When the old horse stables were converted from the Jersey Lilly into the Pearl Stable by Silver Ventures, the ‚ÄúxXx‚Äù was a massive part of the building's motif. The triple Xs were incorporated into areas such as the chandeliers, the millwork above all the doors, massive bronze plaques above the stage and around the mezzanine, in the custom carpet, and even the rafter bracing. At almost every event, the audience is dared to count all the sets of triple Xs. Pearl City, Texas Pearl City, Texas It is not uncommon to see beers named after the towns where they were brewed.

His reports focus on arts and literature, and he has interviewed numerous writers, poets, and musicians. Brown has worked most of his professional career at PBS and has written a poetry collection called The News.  Early life and education  Jeffrey Brown was born in 1956 to Morton Brown and Mirriam \\"Micki\\" Brown (n√©e Decter). He has four siblings, and grew up in Belmont, Massachusetts. He graduated from high school in 1974. Brown studied Classics at the University of California, Berkeley, earning a bachelor's degree. He planned to pursue a PhD subsequently in order to become an academic, but finally decided he wanted to be a law journalist. Brown did a joint program at Berkeley Law and the Columbia Journalism School. He first studied law for two years and then studied journalism for one year. Brown received a master's degree in journalism, but did not finish law school. In 2010, Brown received an honorary degree (D.H.L.) from Wesley College after giving a commencement speech there.  Career  While studying at Columbia, Brown met television executive Fred W. Friendly, who worked as a professor at the university. After he graduated, Brown became Friendly's teaching assistant and a producer for the Columbia University Seminars on Media & Society, a television production company directed by Friendly. For a few years, Brown helped produce and write the seminars that were aired on public television about, among other things, ethics, law, foreign policy, and the Constitution. Thereafter, in 1988, Brown joined the PBS NewsHour, which was at that time called The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour. He was hired as an off-camera economics reporter, and was initially based in New York City, but moved to Washington, D.C. eight years later. At first, Brown worked as a reporter and a producer, before being promoted to the position of senior producer for national affairs. He became an on-camera correspondent in 1998, covering both general events and arts. Brown was named the NewsHour's arts correspondent, when that position was created, in March 2002. Brown was promoted to senior correspondent three years later. In December 2008, the NewsHour launched a blog called \\"Art Beat\\", covering arts and culture, which is written by Brown and other NewsHour reporters. Brown became part of the anchor team, when The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer was renamed PBS NewsHour in December 2009; Jim Lehrer was joined every broadcast by either Judy Woodruff, Gwen Ifill, or Brown. After Lehrer stepped down in June 2012, the program was hosted by Woodruff, Ifill, Brown, Ray Suarez, and Margaret Warner on a rotating basis. That situation ended in September 2013, when Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff became the sole anchors. Simultaneously, Brown was named \\"chief correspondent for arts, culture, and society\\". Between September 2012 and May 2014, Brown presented the series \\"Where Poetry Lives\\" on the NewsHour together with Poet Laureate Natasha Trethewey. They travelled through the US to report on societal issues through the lens of poetry. In 2014, Brown started presenting the NewsHour series \\"Culture at Risk\\" about threatened heritage in the United States and abroad. For that series, he has reported from numerous countries, including Myanmar, Peru, Mali, Nepal (after the April 2015 earthquake), Cuba, Italy, Spain, Tunisia, and South Africa. When the PBS NewsHour launched a monthly book club in collaboration with The New York Times called \\"Now Read This\\" in 2018, Brown became its host, interviewing the writers. Besides covering arts, culture, and society, Brown has during his years as an arts correspondent for the NewsHour also occasionally reported on other subjects including science and politics. For example, he co-anchored coverage of President Obama's second inauguration, and has participated in election night coverage during the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections. Brown has also released a poetry collection called The News, that contains 45 poems about reporting on television, things he encountered while reporting, and personal events in his life. It was published by Copper Canyon Press in May 2015, and has a foreword written by poet Robert Pinsky. Elizabeth Lund wrote the following about the collection in a review in The Washington Post: \\"[Brown] knows how to tell a story, and The News does a wonderful job of balancing the language of journalism and the power of poetry.\\"  Accolades  Brown has won a number of awards, including a News & Documentary Emmy Award, a Peabody Award, and multiple CINE Golden Eagle Awards. The Emmy was awarded in the category \\"Outstanding Background/Analysis of a Single Current Story - (Segments)\\" to a segment about an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1999 and the Peabody Award to a segment about the unemployment rate in 2003. Brown produced both segments. In 2002, Brown won a CINE Golden Eagle Award for his arts coverage on the NewsHour. In the following years, a number of segments, of which Brown he was the correspondent, won Golden Eagles including \\"Intelligent Design v. Evolution\\" (2005), \\"Doubt\\" (2005), \\"Blues Master: B.B. King\\" (2006), \\"Death is on Hold/Connecting with Kids\\" (2007), \\"Haitian Artists Create Poetry Amid Rubble\\" (2011), and \\"Musical Legend Herbie Hancock\\" (2011).

NA or N.A.) was a Dutch ultranationalist political party. It was disbanded in 2007. The party was formed on 12 November 2003, by Jan Teijn and Virginia Kapiƒá. Teijn kicked off his political career in the Centrum Democraten in Rotterdam, before going over to the CP'86, where he was one of the local council members in Rotterdam of a national socialist faction. Teijn was elected to the district council in the Feijenoord district for the NNP, before he moved to the NA midterm. They lost that seat in the 2006 elections (302 votes or 1.2%). Gemeenteraadsverkiezingen - 1998 t/m 2010 - Zuid-Holland, Municipal elections - 1998 through 2010 - South Holland Ideology The NA's ideology was based on nationalism and socialism. The party wanted to protect Dutch culture, was in favour of animal rights and against Battery cage farming, unnecessary animal testing, fur and leather for which animals have to be slaughtered independent from meat production, against the bio-industry in general, and wanted tougher sentences for criminals. The Party sought the withdrawal of the Netherlands from NATO and the EU and was strongly anticapitalistic. The party also rejected other sexual preferences than heterosexuality. The party displayed itself as a \\"social and democratic nationalistic political party\\". Although the party was non-sectarian, they nurtured the Christian standards and values as a part of their national heritage. In April 2005 the party organized a lecture about 'the Aryan roots of Christianity'. In preservation of their cultural heritage, the party celebrated Yule every year, a festivity on the Germanic calendar. The NA's ideology, although more extreme, was often compared with the New Right of Alain de Benoist. Organizational structure The general members conference was the highest institution in the Nationale Alliantie. At this conference, practical and political decisions are made. Members were invited through the party magazine (Weerstand) and the website to participate in this conference. The general conference was organized once a year: as a rule in November. It was also possible to have a members consultation about a subject. The Nationale Alliantie was run by the board of directors, which existed of a chairman, a treasurer and a secretary for the organisation, chosen by the general members conference. The meetings of the board of directors were attended with an advisory vote by the chairman of the youth organisation Dietsland Jeugd (Dietsland Youth). The members of the board of directors were chosen by the general conference for the period of three years and which were eligible for re-election once. The members of the board of directors had a mutual set of tasks. As of 2007, the board of directors included Jan Teijn (chairman), Mari Kostense (secretary) and Ronald Bredijk (treasurer). The youth organisation Dietsland Jeugd was an independent political youth organization officially linked to the Nationale Alliantie. Activities The NA organized a petition to force Islam out of Europe.National Vanguard article. (Archive.org mirror) They announced its first demonstration, at the beginning of February 2004, in support of a demand for the release of Cees Gardien, who was in jail awaiting his trial for killing Yapcup Yuruyucu, a Turkish immigrant that robbed the garage firm owned by Gardien who uses a wheelchair and has a disability. In June 2004 the NA demonstrated in Utrecht against Turkey in the EU. On 11 June 2005, the NA held a demonstration against the construction of a Surinamese mosque and in November 2004 against Muslim violence after the murder on Theo van Gogh, Dutch writer and film producer who was killed by an extremist. Original logo of the NA, based on a Viking shield The party demonstrated repeatedly against paedophiliac association MARTIJN, and agitated against paedophilia. The newspaper Trouw reported on 19 September 2006 that the NA informed the neighbours of a minister from Rotterdam, Hans Visser, about the \\"paedophiliac nature of the minister\\". The party disapproved of the support of Visser to junks (instead of that the party refers to the organisation Victory Outreach) and illegals and had as a point of view that all paedophiles should be imprisoned for life. Visser, a member of the paedophiliac association MARTIJN considered reporting this to the police because of slander. In June 2006, the party launched a petition (', Citizen Initiative). With this, the Nationale Alliantie wanted to realize a ban on organizations that either glorify paedophilia, incite or have the goal to legalize adult-child sex. In November 2005 the NA started an offensive against a Dutch company called Scarlet, which offers telephony and broadband internet. This was because of an advertising billboard in which a small girl in lingerie was used. A group of which the NA said it has no connections with spray- painted the billboard of Scarlet with the text \\"PEDO'S\\". A few days later, Scarlet announced that they would continue with an amended version of their ad, because of all the complaints.Victory against advertising company, Novopress media, 16 November 2005 (Archive.org mirror) On 21 March 2005, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the NA held a demonstration against \\"leftist fascism\\" in Rotterdam. On 22 October 2005, the NA invited the editor-in-chief of Vooraan! to hold a lecture about the extreme-left and antifascists for NA/Dietsland Jeugd members. Pictures of antifascists taken on demonstrations are being posted on the NA forum, in which they offer a cash reward for information leading them to the persons. In March 2006 the NA participated local elections in Rotterdam and the Feijenoord neighbourhood in Rotterdam. Activists started the electoral campaign by distributing flyers in the centre of Rotterdam, dressed in an orange burqa. The party didn't gain any seats in the local elections. NA demonstration in Amsterdam on 27 May 2006 On 11 June 2005, the NA held a demonstration in Rotterdam against the construction of a Surinamese mosque. The demonstration proceeded peacefully, but the NA was the focus of media attention in June 2005 following an arson attack on their old mosque. Although the NA declared that it had nothing to do with it a NA sympathizer was considered the main suspect (the sympathizer was convicted but this conviction was overturned by a higher court in 2006 after a detention of 14 months, as the higher court deemed the evidence inconclusive). Rechtsradicaal Van der Kooi vrij (Right-wing radical Van der Kooi freed), RTV Rijnmond, 17 October 2006. Following the sympathizer's arrest, several moderate NA members left the party, while a number of prominent party leaders also canceled their membership but continue to exercise influence behind the scenes. In September 2006 the NA again became the focus of media attention after 17 members (including 11 soldiers) of Flemish neo-Nazi group Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw (BBET; \\"Blood, Soil, Honour and Loyalty\\") were arrested. According to the press, the leading suspect was organizing the trafficking of weapons, and was developing international links, in particular with the Nationale Alliantie. The Dutch justice department conducted research, at the request of the Belgian authorities, into the Dutch participants, including one of the NA's founders and a former chairman of the NA's youth organisation, in the Leopoldsburg shooting practices. In March last year, twenty Dutch Nazis, including Kapiƒá, took part in a paramilitary training exercise near Spa, organised by Blood & Honour Flanders. They camped in ten tents and had seven military vehicles at their disposal. The Nazis patrolled the area, intimidating passers-by who then informed the police. A search later uncovered stiletto knives and Nazi propaganda. The NA claimed this wasn't true and that the BBET group had only held a lecture (about Zionism and activism) on 29 January 2005 for their youth organization. Their youth organization, however, held a lecture in cooperation with BBET before on 28 May 2005 about \\"Race and reality ‚Äì to the extinction of the white race?\\". The NA calls on white Dutch people to increase their birthrate and demanding a halt to the building of mosques and the closure of The Netherlands' borders to all migrants and refugees. In February 2005 the NA organized a lecture about \\"Disunion of right-wing parties\\". Their guest speaker was Joop Glimmerveen, the former face and leader of the Dutch People-Union (NVU) since the beginning of the 1970s and party ideologist until the end of the 1990s, now one of the biggest critics of the NVU's current leader.

The NA furthermore was present in Flanders every year at the annual IJzerwake (\\"Yser Vigil\\"). On 11 September 2004 the NA took part in a demonstration against terrorism which was held in Antwerpen (Flanders) in corporation with other Flemish nationalist organizations like Groen Rechts and BBET. On 8 December 2004 the NA joined a demonstration against the invasion of China in Tibet and the violating of human rights of the Tibetan people at the Hague. On the occasion of the first national congress of the NA held in Rotterdam in 2005, the American national socialist Harold Covington sent a letter in the name of the 'white nationalist movement' in the United States and Canada and extended greetings from all white nationalists in North America. Covington's books were being promoted on the NA forum.

It is almost directly in the center of the country on the Southern slope of the Turrialba Volcano. The National Monument covers about and is surrounded by rainforest plant vegetation causing it to be extremely vibrant green due to high precipitation and rich soils. One of the most unique facts about the site is that only a small portion of it has been unearthed, excavated, and studied. History Guayabo de Turrialba seems to have been a locus of social power in the wake of this per√≠odo de integraci√≥n. It was initially populated beginning in about 1000 BCE, in the time of Israel‚Äôs King David, and then abandoned in 1400 CE, a century before the Spanish arrived, for reasons that remain a mystery. Researchers still to this day have not found any sign of why people might have left. Although, there is speculation that it might have had to do with something like disease or rival civilizations. It has been estimated that there were about 10,000 people who were residents. Believed to be the home of the Pre-Columbian people, this relic site was first discovered in the 1800s and was first excavated in the year of 1882. What has been found and what the site consists of is the city's infrastructure, petroglyphs, tombs, and artifacts that were left behind and found by archaeologists in the 1960s during further excavations. To be more specific, the magnitude of the known part of the site, presumed to be its central portion, consists of 43 stone foundations, three aqueducts, two major roadways, dozens of smaller paths, and some stone tombs. The people of Guayabo were known to be well aware of good engineering, which can be assumed by their use of aqueducts. Most of the site consists of the circular mounds that the conical wooden structures were once built on. Side note; the villagers used to live in huge communal-like conical houses with thatched roofs with most, if not all, of their family members. One mound in particular, Mound 1, stands out as it is the largest one of this culture and it is located in the center of the village. To its front runs a paved road which connected the surrounding settlements, with it as far as 9km. That is considered the most impressive finding at the site. Architecturally, back in the day, the main building probably served as both a symbol as well as a place to conduct public business. After ascending the stairs next to the center mound, visitors would have been greeted by a matching pair of structures, rectangular in shape. These were probably guardhouses that flank the road at this point and would have controlled access to the settlement. A lot of the artifacts found when excavating, such as the stones and petroglyphs, represented animals such as jaguars and lizards. There were tools that were found that suggested that Guayabo had people dedicated to growing agriculture which mainly consisted of roots such as yucca. Studies have shown that the people of Guayabo did most of their own work although there is some data suggesting slavery may have been practiced. Excavations and Visiting the Site Today Following an 1891 excavation of a cemetery, near over 100 artifacts were displayed at the 1892 Historical American Exposition in Madrid and then much of the display was taken to the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Some of the most prevalent explorers throughout the history of excavating for this site include Anastacio Alfaro, Carlos Aguilar, Oscar Fonseca, and Sergio Ch√°vez. There have been plenty of studies done on Guayabo that even use today's technologies, such as a study done a couple years ago that executed some remote sensing techniques to detect and map the roads in the region. As of 2020 no studies conducted using LIDAR have been made. In 2009, Guayabo was declared an \\"International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark\\" by the American Society of Civil Engineers because of its roads, walls and water channels represent remarkable civil engineering achievements by pre-Columbian civilization. Today, The site is open to the public daily and is a tourist attraction. It has been open to the public since August 13, 1973. One can hike around the trails and observed the structures or tour it with a professional guide. This is a popular destination to visit because although Guayabo is similar to other excavated sites such as Machu Picchu, Chichen Itza, and other South American and Central American ruins in the sense that the artifacts and structures that can be found look similar, but it draws the public in due to the mystery of why it was abandoned and the fact that there is still a big portion of it that has not yet been excavated. It is also sought out by people because of its remoteness in the rainforest. Current State The current state of the structure is in good shape. Everything has been preserved well and kept as authentic as possible. It is now protected within the Guayabo National Monument and is also a part of the Central Volcania Conservation Area. Keeping this site clean and authentic is a big priority to the people of Costa Rica and especially those Costa Ricans who live near it not only because it brings in tourism but they also really value the environment. With Costa Rica being the most environmental conscious country in the world, it is not a surprise that they want to keep it clean. It also helps that unlike other sites such as Machu Picchu where it gets over half a million visitors each year, Guayabo de Turrialba does not receive nearly as many visitors because it is not as popular so it is easier to maintain. There are measures being taken to make sure it stays the condition it is in today stays the same for the future.

Service under Ushakov  Born in a family estate near Borovsk, Senyavin belonged to a notable noble family of sea captains from the Kaluga Governorate, all of whom, starting with his great uncle, served in the Imperial Russian Navy. Having graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps in 1780, he took part in an expedition to Portugal, then joined the Black Sea Fleet upon its formation in 1783 and helped construct the naval base in Sevastopol. In 1786, he commanded a packetboat while at the fleet. Family interests gained him rapid promotion, especially after his resolute actions had prevented a flagship from capsizing during the Varna expedition and Prince Potemkin had entrusted him with a vital task of transporting diplomatic mail to the Russian embassy in Constantinople. During the Russo-Turkish War, Senyavin was present at the battles of Fidonisi and Ochakov and went to Saint Petersburg to inform the Empress about the former victory. He was promoted to adjudant general in 1788. Although he distinguished himself in command of the battleship Navarchia during the Battle of Caliacria, he had no patience with Ushakov's cautious and cunctatory approach and paid little attention to his authority, which resulted in his confinement to a guardhouse and the threat of his reduction in rank. At last Potemkin effected a reconciliation between Senyavin and his peer, remarking in his letter to Ushakov that Senyavin could become the greatest admiral that Russia had ever known. During Ushakov's Mediterranean Expedition of 1798-1800, in which he took part in the years of 1798-1799, Senyavin assumed command of the flagship Saint Peter, equipped with 72 guns. His sailors stormed the French-held Castle of Santa Maura in Lefkada and took part in the capture of Corfu. The expedition over, Senyavin administered the ports of Kherson, and Sevastopol. In 1804, he was promoted to rear admiral and given the task of administering the port in Reval.  Mediterranean campaigns  Three years later, Alexander I of Russia, still entertaining grand designs aimed at stalling Napoleon's expansion in the Adriatic, mounted another Mediterranean expedition, with Vice-Admiral Senyavin as commander-in-chief. By September 1806, Senyavin reasserted Russian control of the southern Adriatic, disrupted Dubrovnik's sea trade, and was poised to attack Lesina. He found a natural ally in the Orthodox prince-bishops of Montenegro, who pledged to support him on land. The Russian fleet captured the islands of Curzola and Lissa, while the Austrians were persuaded to surrender Cattaro to them. As a result of these operations, the French were prevented from taking hold of the Ionian Islands. However, the fruits of Senyavin's activity were thrown away by the tsar who would conclude the Treaty of Tilsit with Napoleon the following year. Even before the treaty was negotiated, a new war with Turkey had erupted and Senyavin's squadron was ordered to proceed to the Aegean Sea in order to attack Constantinople. He reached the Dardanelles on 24 February 1807 and captured the island of Tenedos in March. Using the island as his place d'armes, Senyavin blockaded the Straits and cut off supplies to the Sultan's capital. Senyavin's squadron after the Battle of Athos Contrary to his expectations, Sir John Thomas Duckworth, a British admiral who had just lost 600 men under fire of the shore batteries, refused to join his own fleet with Senyavin's and embarked upon an ill-fated expedition to Alexandria. The Russians were to fight the outnumbering Turks in the Aegean without foreign support. Senyavin's blockade of their capital eventually drove the Turks to extremes. After food riots broke out, Sultan Selim III was replaced with Mustafa IV, who ordered his fleet to break the blockade. The Ottoman ships clashed with Senyavin's squadron in the Battle of the Dardanelles (May 11) and the Battle of Athos (June 16). Both engagements were Russian victories, and ensured Russia's ascendancy in the Aegean for the rest of the war.  Lisbon incident  Upon receiving news about the Treaty of Tilsit, Senyavin was reported to have been overcome with tears (12 August). All of his conquests had to be forfeited after the international situation had been reversed dramatically: Napoleon was now considered Russia's ally and Britain was Russia's foe. On 14 August, he and Lord Collingwood reluctantly parted ways. Eight days later, a large part of the Russian squadron (5 battleships, 4 frigates, 4 corvettes, 4 brigs) was ordered to return to Sevastopol. Senyavin was to lead the remaining fleet to the Baltic, where the Finnish War with Sweden was already brewing. Tenedos was evacuated on 25 August and Senyavin set sail from Corfu on 19 September. Although he planned to proceed directly to Saint Petersburg, stormy weather induced him to enter the Tagus River and cast anchor in Lisbon on 30 October. Within several days, John VI of Portugal fled to the Portuguese colony of Brazil and the Royal Navy blockaded Lisbon, intercepting a Russian sloop as an enemy vessel: the Anglo-Russian War had been declared. In November, French forces under Jean-Andoche Junot overran the Portuguese capital and Senyavin found himself wedged between two warring powers. In the tricky situation, Senyavin distinguished himself as a skilled diplomat and managed to save his ships from destruction. Upon hearing about his plight, Napoleon extorted from the tsar the privilege of giving orders to Senyavin through the Russian embassy in Paris. He immediately demanded to replace British officers serving in Senyavin's squadron with the French or the Germans and advised Senyavin to exchange several ships with Junot. Napoleon's orders were politely ignored by the Russian admiral, who had no intention to risk the lives of his marines in pointless warfare against erstwhile friends and consequently professed his neutrality. In July 1808, Senyavin's ships, still blockaded in Lisbon by the British, were repeatedly visited by Junot and General Kellermann, who exhorted him to assist in their military operations against the Portuguese and the Spaniards. Senyavin responded that he had not been authorized by the tsar to fight the peoples his country was not at war with, and neither promises nor threats would make him change his mind. In August, the French were beaten by the Arthur Wellesley at the Battle of Vimeiro and were compelled to leave Portugal. Senyavin's seven battleships and one frigate were left face to face with 15 British battleships and 10 frigates, to say nothing about coastal artillery. They could have easily annihilated the Russian squadron if Senyavin refused to surrender. The Russian admiral, however, maintained his neutrality, threatening to blow up the ships and set Lisbon ablaze in case of attack. At last, a convention was signed with the British admiral, Sir Charles Cotton, whereby the Russian squadron was to be escorted by the Royal Navy to London without lowering the Russian flags. Moreover, Senyavin was to assume supreme command of the joint Anglo-Russian fleet (as the senior officer of the two), while two Russian ships (Rafail and Yaroslav) were to be left in Lisbon for repairs. On 31 August, Senyavin's squadron embarked from Portugal for Portsmouth. On 27 September, the British Admiralty was informed that enemy vessels cast anchor in the British harbour, with their flags streaming, as if in times of peace. The Lord Mayor of London declared the convention disreputable for Britain's prestige, and many in the Admiralty shared his opinion. The Russian fleet was therefore detained in Portsmouth under various pretexts until winter, when the weather made their return to the Baltic impossible. The British insisted that unless Senyavin's squadron sailed to Arkhangelsk, they would be intercepted by the Swedish men- of-war. In 1809, the departure was further delayed by the disastrous British expedition to Flushing. At long last, on 5 August, the nearly-starved Russian fleet was allowed to leave Portsmouth for Riga and arrived there on 9 September 1809.  Fall from grace and later career  Senyavin's disobedience to the emperors and the loss of his ships to the British resulted in him not being employed again at sea, as well being disgraced at the imperial court upon his return. During Napoleon's invasion of Russia, he once more administered the peaceful port of Reval and was given no chance to take part in hostilities, despite his regular petitions to let him muster a militia in his native province. Although he settled into retirement in the next year, Senyavin's name remained so popular in the Navy that the Decembrist conspirators planned to make him a member of the Provisional Government after staging a palace revolution. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821, Greek insurgents requested the tsar to send \\"the famous Senyavin\\" to their assistance, but their petition was rejected. A Soviet postage stamp of 1987 commemorating Senyavin It was not until Alexander I's death in 1825 that Senyavin was recalled to active service. As Russia was preparing to resume hostilities against Turkey, Nicholas I of Russia, recalling him to active duty in 1826-1829, as he was appointed to command the Baltic Fleet. The following year, he was promoted full Admiral and accompanied Login Geiden's squadron heading for the Mediterranean, where combined Anglo-Franco-Russian forces would score the great victory at Navarino. Dmitry Senyavin died three years later and was interred with great pomp, in the presence of the tsar, at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. He had several ships named after him in the Imperial and Soviet navies, notably the vessel used for the three-year expedition ordered by Nicholas I in 1826. The Senyavin Islands in Oceania and the promontories in Alaska and Sakhalin still commemorate his name.

He co-founded the American Friends of Vietnam, a Cold War lobbying group. Biography Buttinger was born into a working-class family and left school at age 13 to help support his family. He became a youth movement leader in Austria and, by the age of 24, was secretary of the Social Democratic Party. After being imprisoned for several months in 1934, he became chairman of the Socialist underground and a leader of the anti-Fascist movement. When Germany occupied Austria in 1938, he and his American-born wife Muriel Gardiner fled to Paris, where he was chairman of the exiled Socialists. In 1939, several months before the fall of France, the couple moved to the United States with Gardiner's daughter from a previous marriage, Connie, whom Joseph later adopted. In 1941, he and his wife arranged US visas for his brother Alois Buttinger and his family; one of the references for the visa application was signed by Alfred Einstein. During and after World War II, Buttinger helped establish many of the refugee programs for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). His personal actions helped smuggle thousands of anti-Fascist refugees out of Europe. For over 40 years he served as director of the IRC's Paris office and European division, and as an IRC board member and vice president. Under Buttinger's tenure, the Committee became covertly involved with the Central Intelligence Agency. In the 1950s, the IRC made an agreement with the CIA that they would take on projects which the US government did not want to openly be associated with in Vietnam. IRC official Harold Oram operated as a secret liaison between Buttinger and Allan Dulles. In the 1950s, Buttinger and his wife subsidized the democratic socialist magazine Dissent, edited by Irving Howe. He also wrote \\"In the Twilight of Socialism\\", which was a history of Austrian Socialism in the years 1934-38. =American Friends of Vietnam= During the 1950s, he aided North Vietnamese refugees in South Vietnam and took an abiding interest in the history and culture of that country. Initially a friend and supporter of South Vietnam's founder, Ngo Dinh Diem, Buttinger became disillusioned with Diem's dictatorial ways and renounced him. Buttinger was originally introduced to Diem by Edward Lansdale of the CIA, and under Lansdale's encouragement Buttinger formed the American Friends of Vietnam (AFVN). AFVN lobbied for increasing US funding of South Vietnam and the escalation of military action against communism. It also covertly coordinated propaganda efforts directed at the American public, such as Lansdale and Joseph L. Mankiewicz's controversial pro-CIA film adaptation of The Quiet American. Buttinger became a prominent scholar of that country's culture and politics, producing a two-volume work entitled Vietnam: A Dragon Embattled. He also produced several other books on Vietnam and on the history of socialism. In opposition to early critics of US intervention like Graham Greene, and the later conclusions of the Pentagon Papers, Buttinger refused to concede that Ho Chi Minh's popularity in the South, and the unpopularity of the Saigon government, had created a civil war situation. =Later life= In 1972 the Austrian Government awarded him its Golden Order of Merit. According to the New York Times, the then-Chancellor of Austria, Bruno Kreisky, observed that \`Mr. Buttinger was such a hero that if he had returned he would have become Chancellor.'

Injuries restricted his appearances in the football season of 1929‚Äì1930 and 1930‚Äì1931. He scored 13 league goals in the 1931‚Äì1932 football season and 3 FA Cup goals. City managed to reach the semi final of the FA Cup that year but were defeated by Arsenal by 1‚Äì0. In the 1932‚Äì1933 football season Tilson was the club's leading goalscorer with 23 goals in all competitions. This included 17 league goals and 6 FA Cup goals. In the 1933 FA Cup final Manchester City were defeated three goals to nil by Everton who were captained by England international Dixie Dean. Tilson did not play in the final of that year's competition but did play in the 1934 FA Cup final in which he scored twice in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Portsmouth. City had been trailing by a goal to nil at half time and City goalkeeper Frank Swift blamed himself for that had given Portsmouth the lead. Tilson in an attempt to console the young keeper told him not to worry because he would score two in the second half. He was true to his words. p. 55 Legacy Tilson has been inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame. In 1977 the Manchester City Council named eleven streets in a new estate in Moss Side after famous City players including Tilson. p. 75 He is listed as the twenty-eighth greatest ever City player on the Time website and eighteenth in Ian Penney's book The Essential History of Manchester City. p. 188 References Category:English footballers Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. non- playing staff Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:York City F.C. players Category:England international footballers Category:1904 births Category:1972 deaths Category:People from Swinton, South Yorkshire Category:English Football League players Category:English Football League representative players Category:Association football forwards Category:Sportspeople from Yorkshire ","title":"Fred Tilson"},{"id":"4825947","text":"Gwen Norbeck Munson is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera As the World Turns. She was introduced on March 30, 2005 and was portrayed by Jennifer Landon until April 4, 2008, and again in 2010. Landon won three Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actress in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Originally shown to be a poor, emancipated minor, Gwen has risen to become a strong woman with a tough exterior, but when under pressure, the uncertainty of her life prevails. Character history Gwen first appeared on screen as a waitress at Al's, a popular restaurant in town. She was set up on a date with Will Munson, which ended disastrously with Will kicking Gwen out of the car. Will was nursing a crush on Allison Stewart, while Gwen showed more interest in Casey Hughes, Will's best friend. To get closer to Casey, Gwen befriended his girlfriend Celia Ortega. Casey and Gwen shared a secret and Casey preferred it if Gwen stayed away from his circle of friends, but nevertheless she became part of their group. It became clear that Gwen and Casey had previously slept together. While Casey wanted to leave the past behind them, Gwen had stunning news: she was pregnant. Afraid to tell Casey the truth (for fear of upsetting Celia, with whom Gwen had become good friends), Gwen revealed the truth to Will. Will took charge of the situation and pretended to be the baby's father. He made sure Gwen, an emancipated minor living in a tiny apartment in town, made all of her doctor's appointments and kept her good condition for the baby. When Will's mother, Barbara Ryan, found out that Will was claiming to be the father of Gwen's baby, she insisted on a paternity test (that was never taken), thus beginning the feud Barbara and Gwen would have for months to come. Gwen decided to give the baby up for adoption, to Rosanna Montgomery. She gave birth prematurely, thanks in part to the lack of care she received in her early pregnancy, and began to connect with the baby. When Rosanna fell into a coma after being run off the road in her car, Gwen thought that she and Will (who she fell in love with) would be free to take custody of the baby, but a roadblock was thrown in in the form of Carly Snyder, Rosanna's half-sister. Before slipping into her coma, Rosanna told Carly to take care of the baby boy. Gwen sought custody of the baby, but at the hearing, the judge wanted her to name the father of the child. Tearfully, she confessed that Casey was the father of her child, not Will. A paternity test was done and, shockingly, Casey was not a match to the child! The whole town turned against Gwen, as Casey's family had been the cornerstone of Oakdale for many years. Even Will turned against her. While Carly had custody of the child, Gwen had visitation rights. Carly wanted to force Gwen out once and for all, resorting to dirty tricks to get her out of the picture. Gwen's life became even more complicated when her mother, Iris Dumbrowski, arrived in Oakdale. The judge granted Gwen temporary custody as long as she lived with Iris. Iris didn't like Will and schemed to have him arrested for poisoning her. Gwen and Will took the baby on the run with them to New York City. After Carly, Iris, and Carly's husband Jack followed them, Gwen learned that Carly was her half- sister; they shared the same father! Iris went to jail for setting up Will and the baby went back to Carly and Jack. A surprising truth came out that shocked everyone: the baby was not Gwen's child. It was actually the son of Jennifer Munson, Will's sister. The babies were switched at birth by Craig Montgomery. Since Gwen's baby turned out to be Jennifer's, it was clear that Gwen's baby was the one believed to be Jennifer's: the one who had died shortly after birth. Gwen and Casey mended their relationship and became friends. Gwen and Will fell deeper in love. Barbara was dead set against their love and schemed to break them up. She cut off Will's trust fund, leaving the two teenagers penniless, and she enlisted Hal to help get them evicted from their apartment. After weeks of living life homeless, Gwen and Will ran away to Springfield to get married. They returned to town and moved in with Will's father, Hal Munson, under the condition that they both go back to school and graduate. Casey helped Gwen get a job at his grandmother's new teen music club, Crash, as Gwen had previously been a part of a band. Gwen found out Jade Taylor helped Will cheat on a test. Gwen helped counsel Carly with her divorce from Jack. The Oakdale Slasher killed some of Gwen's classmates and attempted to kill Gwen. The Slasher was revealed to be Eve, Maddie's sister. Jade Taylor pretended to pregnant with Will's child and left Gwen contemplating a divorce of her own. When Gwen and Will found out that Jade was faking her pregnancy, they reunited. Will's brother Adam came to town on the heels of their father's death (Hal Munson). Adam agreed to produce a demo of Gwen's music. When Gwen found out that Adam was seeing Jade, she stopped the production immediately. She didn't want to work with anyone who was involved with Jade Taylor. Still, Gwen was desperate to make music, so, eventually, she agreed to go along with Adam. Gwen was thrilled that she could finally do what she loves the most. Seeing her so happy and enthusiastic, Adam started to fall for her. When they went to New York for a couple of days to promote Gwen's song, Adam decided to make his move and kissed Gwen. However, even though she liked Adam, Gwen made it clear that they were just friends and that she was married. Adam accepted her rejection and apologized to her. But Adam had changed. He kept trying to seduce Gwen, no matter what she said. Then, Gwen and Will's money was stolen, and while some knew Casey was the one behind it, Adam made it look like Will was the one who stole it. He even placed fake evidence and Gwen started to believe that Will was really guilty. But when she heard about Casey's gambling problem, she knew Will wasn't the one who stole the money, Casey was. Will and Casey gave their brother a chance and let him leave Oakdale. Adam asked Gwen to meet him in the forest, so they could say goodbye. Even though Gwen didn't feel comfortable with it, she decided to go anyway. There, Adam confessed his love for her and despite the fact Gwen tried to reject him, Adam forced her to kiss him. Suddenly, Adam was hit from behind by Maddie, who thought Adam tried to rape Gwen. Unfortunately, Adam was hit so hard that his head was covered with blood and he wasn't breathing. Afraid that they might have killed him and that they would go to jail, Maddie and Gwen buried Adam in the forest. Soon after, Gwen discovered her wedding ring was buried along with Adam. Scared to death that someone might find the body along with her ring, Gwen went to his grave several times to find her ring, without any success. Then, someone started to stalk Gwen, sending dead flowers and walking around her house. Eventually Adam revealed he was still alive, and he attacked Gwen. He was caught in mid-attack by Will and Casey, who overpowered him and forced him to agree to leave Oakdale forever. Angry at Gwen and Maddie for getting away with attempted murder while continuing to look down their noses at her, Jade vowed revenge. Posting an ad on the internet for a Gwen lookalike, she caught the attention of Cleo Babbit. Exactly what Jade intended for Cleo to do is unclear because Cleo soon decided to go it alone, and wormed her way into Will and Gwen's lives. Cleo wanted Will to fall in love with her and leave Gwen, and deluded herself for a while into thinking that it was happening. Finally growing impatient, Cleo admitted her feelings to Will, who rejected her. In retaliation, she knocked him out and then kidnapped Gwen, tying her to a railroad track alongside Jade, who had tried to warn the couple and stop the dangerous Cleo. Gwen and Jade escaped, and Cleo was arrested and never heard from again. The Cleo experience changed Jade and caused her to make nice with Gwen before leaving town. With the departure of her longtime nemesis, Gwen enjoyed some happy stress-free time with her husband. Gwen surprised Will with the news that she was pregnant in August 2007. Also in that month, Gwen was shocked to learn that her older brother Cole was back in Oakdale, after deserting her ten years prior to cope with a drunken Iris all alone. Later, Gwen would miscarry, but her life was saved by Alison Stewart and her mother Susan Stewart. Then Barbara tells her son and Gwen that a couple wants to give up their yet unborn child for adoption. Gwen and Will have doubts since the couple wants to remain unknown, but eventually go on with the plan. What they don't know is that this couple is in fact Sofie Duran and her boyfriend Cole Norbeck. The plan was made by Barbara and Iris, who paid Cole big money for this. Sofie was told that her baby would go to a couple who also wanted to remain anonymous. Both sides continued with it all, until Alison found out about the plan. She told Gwen and Will, who confronted both their mothers with their plans. Barbara admitted that there was no other way for them to get a baby otherwise, because no agency would let them adopt a baby due to Will's past. Will broke the bond with his mother and informed Sofie. A week later, Sofie went into labor and Gwen and Will help her deliver the baby. When Sofie is alone in her bedroom she cries for Cole, who left town, and for knowing she can't raise this baby. Back at home, Gwen breaks down in Will's arms because she still wants this baby. Sofie makes a decision. She tells Gwen and Will that she will give them her baby, if she gets to be a part of her life. After Sofie signed all rights of the baby to Will and Gwen, she felt a connection between her and her baby. She thought it would go away, but it didn't. As Sofie got more and more involved in Hallie's (Gwen and Will's choice of name for the baby) life Gwen and Will decided it would be best if Sofie stayed away for a while. Sofie did not like this and broke down and felt depressed. While Will and Gwen let Barbara babysit for Hallie, Sofie came and asked if she could see Hallie. Barbara did not like Sofie so she said no (in a mean way). Later when Barbara was napping (at the same time Hallie is napping) Sofie came back, and saw that Barbara left the door unlocked. Sofie took Hallie. When Gwen and Will come back, they notice that the door is open and when they find Hallie missing, they go to the police. They both know that it was Sofie who took the baby. Aaron (a friend of both Sofie's and Will and Gwen's) goes to find Sofie, and finds her in New York. Eventually Sofie brings back Hallie because she has a fever. Gwen feels bad for Sofie and knows what it feels like to lose a baby, so she convinces Will to drop the charges. Sofie decides that she wants to go to court for custody of Hallie, and feels abandoned when Aaron testifies for Will and Gwen (because he is Hallie's godfather). The judge grants Will and Gwen full custody of Hallie, and Sofie feels even more depressed. As time goes on Gwen is feeling more and more like they took Hallie from her mom, and even though she loves Hallie so much, she can't live with herself if this keeps on going on. Will tries to snap her out of it, because he doesn't want to give Hallie up, but behind his back Gwen gives Hallie to Sofie (not legally). Will comes back to find out that Gwen has already given Hallie to Sofie and is mad, but still loves Gwen. Will hopes that Gwen will change her mind and take Hallie back before Sofie becomes Hallie's mother legally. When Hallie gets sick, Gwen is there to help Sofie. While they help Hallie in time, Sofie realizes that though she is Hallie's biological mother she is not what's good for Hallie. Gwen and Will are. Sofie gives Hallie back to Gwen and Will for the last time. After this, Gwen and Will decide to leave town with Hallie, to start a new life with just the three of them. The character of Hallie has been said to \\"embody the Jungian archetype\\" of the Child, because of the pronounced mode of interaction between Hallie and the other characters in the series.Shatkin, Elina, \\"Searching the Soaps for Substance,\\" Los Angeles magazine, September 4, 2013 References External links * http://www.soapcentral.com/atwt/whoswho/gwen.php Category:As the World Turns characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional clerks Category:Fictional maids Category:Fictional singers Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Gwen Norbeck Munson"},{"id":"4825952","text":"Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Duke of Leinster (born 7 April 1948), styled Earl of Offaly before 1976 and Marquess of Kildare between 1976 and 2004, is an Irish nobleman and landscape designer.A Californian claimant, an 'escape' from the trenches and the fight for a dukedom from The Daily Telegraph retrieved 6 August 2014 The Duke is the highest-ranking member of the peerage of Ireland.Debrett's Family and education The elder son of Gerald, 8th Duke of Leinster, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of Lt-Col Philip Smith, MC, TD, he was educated at Millfield School, Street, Somerset.

It was a court of justice dealing with private law (what is referred to in common law systems as civil law).  Evolution  The name centumviri literally means \\"100 men\\"; this was the original number of members from which pool the court was selected. The number of men of which the court consisted is not known. In the Republic, the number increased to 105 and later still, during the Empire, to 180. During the Empire, four courts were usually chosen from the pool, although the entire membership might sit in unusual cases. The Decemviri (ten men) presided over the court from the Augustan period. Membership of this council was considered to be a standard position for those embarking on the cursus honorum. A number of notable orators appeared in this court, including Cicero, Tacitus and Pliny the Younger. Jurisdiction The jurisdiction of the court is unclear, although cases involving wills and inheritance were certainly part of the court's remit. The querela inofficiosi testamenti (\\"complaint about an undutiful will\\") was established by this court. However, it is uncertain whether this court was simply an alternative to the iudex or part of a more complex judicial system. It has been suggested that cases before the centumviral court had a specific minimum value.  Location  In the second half of the 1st century the court met in the Basilica Julia in the Forum. It is likely that, like many such Roman institutions, the physical location of the court was apt to change. Cicero's account The centumviri were mainly concerned with the property of which account was taken at the census. It was therefore in their power to make or unmake a citizen. They also decided questions concerning debt. Hence the plebs had an interest in securing their decisions against undue influence. They were never regarded as magistrates, but merely as judices, and as such would be appointed for a fixed term of service by the magistrate, probably by the praetor urbanus. But in Cicero's time they were elected by the Comitia Tributa. They then numbered 105. Their original number is uncertain, although the centum (Latin for the number 100) portion of centumviri may provide a clue. It was probably increased by Augustus and in Pliny's time had reached 180. The office was probably open in quite early times to both patricians and plebeians. The term is also applied in the inscriptions of Veii to the municipal senates and Cures, which numbered 100 members.

Its original pejorative meaning of 'fool, idiot' is largely lost and it is now used to mean \\"friend\\", and thus corresponds in some ways to expressions such as \\"mate\\", \\"pal\\", \\"man\\", \\"dude\\". As in the above English examples, re may be used both before or after a phrase: \\"Œ°Œµ, Œ±œÖœÑŒÆ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒÆ ŒºœÄœçœÅŒ±\\" (\\"Hey, this is some good beer\\"), or, \\"Œ†Œ¨ŒºŒµ Œ≥ŒπŒ± Œ∫Œ±ŒºŒπŒ± ŒºœÄœçœÅŒ±, œÅŒµ\\" (\\"Let's go get a beer, man\\"). However, it is familiar, so it is not used to older people or to strangers, when it can be considered offensive. The feminine version, mori, preserves the original pejorative sense regardless of context when used by males, but it is used in familiar context when used among women or in gay slang. In Cyprus, it is common to address either a sister, female cousin, or female friend as \\"ra\\", as opposed to re. When used with loud voice, or with commands, it sounds rude or offensive \\"Stand up, re\\" ‚Üí \\"You, stand up now!\\" However, if followed by sy (\\"you\\") or the addressee's name it is considered milder, and friendly (e.g., \\"Stand up, re George\\" > \\"Stand up, my friend George\\"). Of course the above is not always standard since everything depends on the context and the intonation. It is very common for Greeks raised in Greece but living abroad (especially in the UK) to use re semi-jokingly when speaking English in the same way they use it when they speak Greek (e.g., \\"Are you serious re?\\", \\"How are you re Jim?\\" ) Similarly, Greek rappers will use it along with the interjection man! as in \\"Re man\\". In the Greek American community of Tarpon Springs, Florida, a variation of the word is used with the same meaning. Instead of the term re, with the rolling of the \\"r\\" being said, the Greeks there say \\"ray\\", with no rolling of the \\"r\\". \\"Ray\\" is thus said as in typical English. \\"Ray, lets go to the Sponge Docks,\\" or \\"What's up, Ray?\\" is how the term is used locally. This is common only in Tarpon Springs, and the usage of the term is often mocked by Greek Americans throughout the country. = \\"Re gamoto\\" = In Greece and Cyprus re is often accompanied by a slang word or a profanity, such as gamoto or gamoti (Œ≥Œ±ŒºœéœÑŒø or Œ≥Œ±ŒºœéœÑŒ∑), meaning fuck!, an exclamation of fury, surprise or admiration that is considered vulgar.Œ†Œ±œÅŒ¨ŒªŒªŒ∑ŒªŒ∑ Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∂ŒÆœÑŒ∑œÉŒ∑ In 1992, in her first statement to the Greek journalists minutes after the 100 m hurdles race at the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Voula Patoulidou, the surprise winner, dedicated her medal to her home country by saying \\"ŒìŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±, œÅŒµ Œ≥Œ±ŒºœéœÑŒø\\" (Gia ten Ellada, re gamoto! \\"For Greece, goddamit!\\"), a catchphrase that is still in use; it became emblematic in Greece, and was used and paraphrased in various occasions by the Greek mass media, satirists, Greek bloggers, and ordinary people.

The 90 MHz model was sold in Japan as the Power Macintosh 7215, and the 120 MHz model with bundled server software as the Apple Workgroup Server 7250. When sold as the 8200, it used the 8100's mini-tower form factor. The 7200 was introduced alongside the Power Macintosh 7500 and 8500 at the 1995 MacWorld Expo in Boston. Apple referred to these machines collectively as the \\"Power Surge\\" line, communicating that this second generation of PowerPC machines offered a significant speed improvement over their predecessors. Introduced as a successor to the Power Macintosh 7100, the 7200 represents the low end of this generation of Power Macintosh, which replaced NuBus with PCI. It shares the 7500's \\"Outrigger\\" case. At launch, the 7200 was available with processor speeds of 75 and 90 MHz, with the slower model being replaced by a 120 MHz CPU in February 1996. The 120MHz model was also available in a \\"PC compatible\\" variant, which came with a PCI card that allowed the computer to run Microsoft Windows and other PC operating systems. The card featured a 100 MHz Pentium processor. The Power Macintosh 7300 replaced the 7200 in February 1997.  Upgrades  Unlike other Power Macintosh machines of the time, the CPU is soldered to the motherboard instead of on a daughterboard. This presented a challenge for users who wanted to upgrade to a faster processor. At the time of its introduction, Apple promised an inexpensive logic board upgrade to the 7500, but due to high demand for the 7500, this never materialized. When the upgrade was finally made available, it was to the follow-on model, the Power Macintosh 7600, and came in the form of a complete logic board replacement. The base price was $1,300 and upgraded the system to a CPU, but did not include L2 cache. The 7200's CPU was considered otherwise impossible to upgrade until, over three years after the 7200 was discontinued, Sonnet eventually produced an G3 upgrade card for the PCI slots.

It lies at the centre of the townland of Straidlands, in the Civil Parish of Ballynure within the Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council area, and in the former barony of Belfast Lower. The village has a congregational church, an Orange hall, and a primary school. History The village is of pre-Norman antiquity. Human habitation goes back in the area many thousands of years, and of great local excitement were the discovery of Bronze Age cist graves nearby. For an exhibition at the Ulster Hall in 1870, the Rev. James Bain of Straid Congregational Church contributed arrow-heads, spear-heads, flint and bronze tools, and ancient coins which had been found in the Straid area.The Belfast News-Letter, 21 May 1870 There are other pre- historic earthworks threatened by the expansion of the village. The name of the village is an Anglicisation of the Irish Gaelic word Sraid, meaning \\"street\\", as it was originally just a street. The village has historically developed along Main Street, which contains many original buildings. In recent years development has been concentrated between Main Street and Irish Hill Road. Straid Primary School and Straid Congregational Church are in the village, the inscription on the church reads \\"Ebenezer, erected 1816, rebuilt and enlarged 1837\\" There is also a freemason‚Äôs hall. The local river is called the Bryantang, meaning \\"the fairy-fort of the tongue.\\" This may refer to a fort which was located close to Straid Dam (Straid Fisheries) in the middle of Bryantang townland. The existence of the rath (one of many in the area) was noted in the 1839 Ordnance Survey Memoirs on the land of James Boyd, but by 1875 it was said to have been destroyed. Note: The 'Bronze Age Cysts' discovery of 1990 was in Straid, Londonderry and not as suggested here, from the village of Straid, Ballyclare. =19th century= Straid was influenced by the 1859 Christian revival under the then-pastor James Bain. Tom Shaw writes: \\"The cockfighting pit, which had been a place for vice of the worst kind, became a preaching point where many were won to Christ. Public bars began to close, and profanity and drunkenness, which characterized many lives, were set aside as the Spirit of God moved through the community.\\" James Bain describes a typical revival Sabbath: \\"Our Sabbath services are continuous, from nine in the morning until ten at night. We are engaged from nine to twelve in prayer meetings for the young, from twelve to two in public service, from two to four in prayer meetings, from five to eight in the evening service, and finally in our evening prayer meeting. The evening services at the church became so well attended that the only suitable place to assemble was outdoors. At one of these evening gatherings, some of the new converts gave testimony, and Bain preached two sermons. The whole audience was gripped with a sense of intense spiritual anxiety. Numbers cried for mercy, and not a single soul departed from that scene until morning.\\" In June 1859 3000 people gathered for an open- air service in a field adjoining the village. =Contemporary description= > STRAID is a village less than 2 miles east of Ballyclare, in the barony of > Lower Belfast.

Letters > should be addressed, Straid, Ballyclare Although a small village, it gave the name \\"Straidlands\\" to the \\"townland\\" of the area. Dominating the village is the \\"Irish Hill\\" named after an army camp. A mining village for many years, there is an outcrop of bauxite or Aluminium ore in Irish hill. The woods at the top of the hill have a distinctive gap where a hurricane in the early 1920s blew down part of the forest. =Recent history= In 2003 the village was expanded by 63 houses, creating a new housing estate at \\"village hill\\" - Irish Hill Road. For many years the only two shops in the village were a spirit grocer and Wilson's shop and animal food stuffs. The spirit grocer (a precursor to the modern off licence) was shut when the only alcohol licence for the village was bought by the church to keep Straid \\"dry\\" - the nearest pub is slightly over a mile away in the neighboring village of Ballynure. There was culture in the form of Straid Art Gallery, until it shut. Now there is none. Population In the 1881 Census, Straid had a population of 111 people. In the 2001 Census, the village had a population of 312 people. In the 2011 Census, Straid had a population of 384 people owing to the building of a housing development in 2010. Farming One of the main crops that made the area rich was flax. Cows are now a common sight in the area, as are sheep. Corn was ground in Straid Corn Mill which was built and operated by the Wilson family. In the 1860s there was also a kiln and flax mill on the site. To the East of the village towards Carrickfergus, an important part of local heritage was recently destroyed with the demolition of the old flax mill to make way for new housing. This caused some controversy at the time. A famous local group that reflects the agricultural background of the area is \\"Straid young farmers\\" club. Fishing One of the big attractions to the area is fishing - Straid Fishery is one of the top rainbow trout fisheries in N.Ireland. Based on Straid Dam, which was man-made around 1824 to supply the nearby cottonmill, there are 3 lakes: 20 acre, 2 acre and .5 acre. Fly fishing on the two lake is complemented by a small coarse lake.

L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology, defined it this way in the book Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought: \\"Para-Scientology includes all of the uncertainties and unknown territories of life which have not been completely explored and explained.\\"L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought, 1997 paperback edition, pg. 91 Hubbard sometimes used the term to differentiate between things that he considered facts and absolute certainties, and things that were still partially undetermined and on the cutting edge of Scientology research. One such example can be found in Hubbard's book Scientology: A New Slant on Life: \\"In Para-Scientology, there is some evidence that the stomach once produced sufficient life energy to motivate the body without any further 'food', but the body of man and beasts in general is not equipped so today, and of that we are very certain\\".Hubbard, Scientology: A New Slant on Life, pg. 114, 1997 paperback edition) On other occasions, Hubbard used the term to simply designate basic Scientology concepts that were not fully grasped by beginning Scientologists (pre-clears), and must remain \\"Para-Scientological\\" to that person until he or she accepts them as fact: \\"Some of the classified bodies of data which fall in Para-Scientology are: Dianetics, incidents on the \\"wholetrack\\", the immortality of Man, the existence of God, engrams containing pain and unconsciousness and yet all perception, prenatals, clears, character, and many other things which, even when closely and minutely observed, still are not certain things to those who observe them. Such things have relative truth\\".George Malko - Scientology: the Now Religion Para-Scientology was also a Hubbard lecture recorded in the 1950s but only released in 2002 as part of the Classic Lecture Series by the Church of Scientology. It focuses specifically on so-called \\"paranormal\\" subjects from a Scientological perspective, such as witches, ghouls, demons and \\"the nasty problem of werewolves\\". Critical views George Malko, in his book Scientology: The Now Religion, sees the differentiation between Scientology and Para-Scientology as tenuous and relative. He writes: > The notion of a Scientology and a Para-Scientology confounds only because > with continued development of various avenues of thinking, it became > increasingly difficult to separate what was a concrete Scientological > \\"consideration,\\" and what represented Para-Scientology's \\"highly specialized > system in order to observe them at all.\\" That there is no true division > between the two categories is evident from the Axioms, which represent the > fundamental substance of all which Scientology believes, and which Hubbard > calls \\"commonly held considerations\\". Malko also points out that Hubbard states in 1954's The Creation of Human Ability that the concept of \\"past lives\\" was only a theory. However, by 1960 and the publication of Have You Lived Before This Life, Hubbard was insisting past lives are not a theory,but a fact proven by experiments with his e-meter. Professor Stephen A. Kent, in his paper The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology noted that in 1953 (before Scientology became a religion), > \\"Hubbard began making tentative connections between Scientology and > religion. He formulated the awkward category, \\"Para-Scientology,\\" in which > he placed what he called \\"all greater or lesser uncertainties\\" such as > 'Dianetics, incidents on the 'whole track,' the immortality of Man, the > existence of God,\\" as well as \\"past lives, mysterious influences, astrology, > mysticism, religion, psychology, psychiatry, nuclear physics and any other > science based on theory' (Hubbard, 1953c: 377). Scientology, Hubbard > asserted, was the science of certainty, and Dianetics (like the other > beliefs and practices that he mentioned) 'is a specialized thing based on > theory which, no matter how workable, requires specialized observation'.... > Presumably this distinction makes sense to some of Hubbard's followers\\". > (Religious Studies and Theology journal, Vol.18, No.2 (December 1999) > Scientology - The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology by Stephen Kent References External links * Scientology Glossary * Para-Scientology and the Knowingness of Man *Golden Era's Para-Scientology page Category:Scientology beliefs and practices ","title":"Para-Scientology"},{"id":"4826107","text":"Ranong may refer to *the town Ranong *Ranong Province *Mueang Ranong district ","title":"Ranong (disambiguation)"},{"id":"4826109","text":"Kanchanaburi may refer to *the town Kanchanaburi *Kanchanaburi Province *Mueang Kanchanaburi district ","title":"Kanchanaburi (disambiguation)"},{"id":"4826116","text":"Jonathan Steven Adelstein is an American political appointee and trade association president.

Gang is an educational Nintendo Entertainment System game that was released in 1992 exclusively for a North American audience. It was not licensed by Nintendo. The game teaches children to say no to potentially harmful drugs like tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. Wally Bear and the NO! Gang was designed in cooperation with, and endorsed by, the American Medical Association and the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information.  Wally Bear characters  Wally Bear and related characters were originally conceived by Walter J. Marsh, founder of Foglesville, Pennsylvania Edutainment, Inc. The company was founded in April 1990, and a trademark for \\"Wally Bear and the No Gang\\" was established in September of that year. A newer character, Recycleman, was trademarked in November, 1991. Long after the release of this NES game, and separate from it, Wally Bear and related characters are still used by the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information in publications, for the purposes of substance abuse awareness and prevention, and the promotion of general health.  Game development  Wally Bear and the NO! Gang was developed by American Game Cartridges. Due to financial problems at AGC by 1991, the rights to distribute it were purchased by American Video Entertainment. Wally Bear and the NO! Gang was originally going to be titled Wally Bear and the Just Say No Team, but due to an existing trademark of the phrase \\"Just Say No\\", it was renamed during development.  Game plot  Wally Bear's uncle, Gary Grizzly, has planned a party for Wally and the NO! Gang. At Wally's house, his parents tell him to go invite the rest of his friends to the party, and to reach his uncle Gary's house before dark. They give him parting advice to stay away from drugs. Wally skateboards everywhere he goes in the game on his way to Gary Grizzly's house. The game is a side-scroller, and levels vary from suburban streets, subway cars, industrial areas, demon fortresses, and city streets. Along the way, Wally meets up with members of the NO! Gang, and converses with them about drug and alcohol use. Upon reaching Uncle Gary Grizzly's house, Gary reveals that the rest of the NO! Gang has arrived ahead of Wally. Gary breaks the fourth wall, suggesting that Wally has brought a friend with him (meaning, the player of the game). The game ends with a cutscene of the party in progress, and Wally offers anti-drug advice to the player. = Game characters =  The NO! Gang  * Wally Bear * Billy Bunny * Priscilla Possum * Rachel Rabbit * Stevie Squirrel * Timmy Tiger * Toby Turtle *You  In-game villains * Ricky Rat * Larry Lizard * Willard Weasel  Game manual  = NES system modification = Wally Bear and the NO! Gang, as an unlicensed Nintendo Entertainment System game cartridge, did not work on systems manufactured after October, 1990. Newer NES consoles, with a \\"revision 11\\" circuit board, contained hardware protections preventing unlicensed game cartridges from running properly. The manual explains this (along with a no symbol above 'Rev. 11', and the title \\"Just Say NO!\\"), then provides instructions on how to modify an NES game console to bypass Nintendo's hardware protections. = The Wally Bear and the NO! Gang Club = The game manual for Wally Bear and the NO! Gang contained a cut-out postcard that allowed the purchaser of the game to join the Wally Bear and the NO! Gang Club. The postcard could be mailed to a post office box in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania (the address of Edutainment, Inc. at the time) along with $3.50. A club member received a poster, stickers, and a bi-monthly newsletter with the \\"gang's adventures, and products with special membership discounts\\".  Reception  The game received mixed reviews at release. In its May 1992 issue, GamePro magazine gave Wally Bear a 5 out of 5 rating (\\"Outstanding!\\") for Fun Factor, and Challenge. It received a 4 out of 5 (\\"Great job!\\") for Gameplay and Graphics. Its lowest rating was for its Music, 3 out of 5 (\\"Good job\\"). It had this to say about the game: \\"Wally Bear, like Life cereal, is good for you ‚Äî and fun. The graphics are decent, but the music sounds like a Playskool tune. Hopefully, through Wally, you'll see that it‚Äôs cool to say 'NO' to drugs.\\" Years after its release, Wally Bear and the NO! Gang found renewed notoriety through mentions such as an August 15, 1999 article at seanbaby.com.  Use by NCADI/SAMHSA  The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI), a part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, has used Wally Bear and related characters for several years as part of alcohol and drug and health awareness aimed at children. = Wally Bear and the KNOW Gang = NCADI rebranded the team \\"Wally Bear and the KNOW Gang\\" before 1994, and expanded their message to include social and general health topics. An eighth character was added, Recycleman. Recycleman was billed as the KNOW Gang's favorite superhero, and was half man, and half machine.  The Wally Bear Hotline  A toll free telephone number was created and run by the NCADI. Callers to 1-800-HI-WALLY (1-800-449-2559) would be greeted by Wally Bear, and could hear various anti drug and messages relating to topics like alcohol, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and marijuana. They could join the Wally Bear and the KNOW Gang Club through the mailing address for the NCADI, a post-office box in Rockville, Maryland. This club, unrelated to the one attached to the NES game, allowed ordering posters and other materials. The hotline gained traction as a standalone children's drug use prevention hotline, as evidenced by a 1995 newspaper article that did not mention the NES game at all. The hotline received national exposure in the February 18, 1996 issue of Parade magazine, and was used on the health.org website in its kids area in the early 2000s. The content on the hotline was not updated to reflect a complete retool of the Wally Bear franchise in June 2004. Nevertheless, the hotline was still active as late as 2006 with old \\"Wally Bear and the KNOW Gang\\" material. The NCADI Wally Bear hotline had been disconnected by June 2007. = Building Blocks for a Healthy Future = In June 2004, \\"Wally Bear and the KNOW Gang\\" was retired. It was replaced with the Building Blocks for a Healthy Future program, featuring \\"Wally Bear and Friends\\", later the \\"Building Blocks Friends\\". The new program still featured Wally Bear, but his six animal friends had different names or genders (and the second rabbit of the team was changed into a cat). The program featuring the team focused on childhood development, parental interaction with children, and drug and alcohol awareness. The Building Blocks Friends were retired entirely from the program website by March 2015 as the site was \\"enhanced to incorporate the latest evidence-based strategies and programs on early childhood health promotion and substance abuse prevention\\". That said, it is still possible to order the Building Blocks for a Healthy Future Kit from the old program as a paper publication.

On 21 September 1864, the light-draft monitor departed the sheltered waters of the navy yard on her maiden voyage. However, she soon began taking on water at such an alarming rate that she came about and returned to Philadelphia where she was decommissioned later in the month. Design revisions Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Stimers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Stimers had failed to compensate for the armour his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by nearly two feet and the first few completed vessels had their turrets removed and a single pivot-mount 11 inch Dahlgren cannon mounted. These same few vessels had a retractable spar torpedo added as well. Tunxis would be the first monitor of the class to keep her armoured turret. On 19 October 1864 Tunxis entered William Cramp & Sons' shipyard, Philadelphia, for extensive refit and rebuilding. On 12 July 1866, two years to the day since her first commissioning, the monitor emerged from the complete overhaul far more seaworthy than before. Nevertheless, since her class design had proven disappointing, she was immediately laid up at League Island Navy Yard. Fate On 15 June 1869, her name was changed to Hydra; and, on 10 August 1869, she was renamed Otsego. In 1874, Otsego was broken up for scrap, having never seen active service.

A serviced office broker will commonly help business center owners and facility management companies to rent serviced office space. Companies offering serviced offices are generally able to offer more flexible rental terms, as opposed to a conventional leased office which may require furnishing, equipment, and more restrictive leases. Space is normally flexible, allowing for additional space to be allocated at short notice, should the size of an individual business change. Serviced office providers often allow tenants to share reception services, business machines and other resources, providing reduced costs and access to equipment which may otherwise be unaffordable. By providing businesses with access to a workplace, technology and people central to its operations, the serviced office can be considered a type of virtual office. Serviced offices are a central component to the flexible workspace industry.  History  Pioneers of the serviced office industry in the United States are recorded as early as the 1960s, with the creation of OmniOffices in 1962, followed by the launch of Paul Fegen's furnished law suites for attorneys in 1966. The concept then spread abroad to Australia, where Alf Moufarrige founded ServCorp in 1978, and to the U.K. where the Fuchs family launched a business center in Northampton, England, in 1979. During the 1980s, serviced offices in the major US business cities, evolved from law suites into business centers. In the UK, the concept of working together and sharing premises, staff and other overheads was at first primarily used by Barristers. They normally band together into \\"chambers\\" to share clerks (administrators) and operating expenses. Some chambers grow to be large and sophisticated, and have a distinctly corporate feel. The advances in computer technology during the 1980s reduced the amount of staff required to operate a serviced office, and increased the technologies a serviced office could offer its clients, including access to computers, voicemail, and fax machines. Richard Nissen founded Business Space Ltd. in London in 1980 and was a pioneer of the new digital exchange telecommunications system that used electronics to place and transfer telephone calls. Now primarily virtual offices offering businesses a place, people and technology, serviced offices became an industry. Seminal reports on the industry were carried out by DTZ in the early 2000s, and published with the British Council for Offices. The National Audit Office of the UK has produced a guide to help Government Departments and public bodies to assess the case for flexible managed space instead of conventional office space. In November 2014, a business report carried out by the Business Centre Association (renamed the Flexible Space Association in 2019) showed that serviced offices in the UK are using 70 million square feet of space, house around 80,000 businesses, provide over 400,000 jobs and generate in the region of ¬£2bn to the UK economy. Coworking spaces are a branch of serviced offices that add elements of collaboration and community to the workspace. The term was coined by Bernard de Koven in 1999 and has since become a popular trend for start-ups and international satellites.  Client types  Clients of serviced office facilities fall into the following categories: * New market/locational ‚Äì Businesses which are typically headquartered abroad or in another region of the country which require a business presence in the area of operation of the business center. * Startup Companies / Entrepreneurial ‚Äì Small to medium businesses or enterprises which don't want to make a financial commitment to a longer term lease. This class of client likely also benefits from not having to add administrative and support personnel to payroll, with all the pursuant HR costs (benefits, insurance, recruitment). * Overflow ‚Äì Typically a large company experiencing growth, with traditional leased space in the area which it has outgrown. These can be short-term requirements (3‚Äì6 months) for large number of users (as many as 40-50). * Interim ‚Äì Clients that are in the process of moving from one space to another, and may be facing delays in the completion of the new space. * Project-based ‚Äì Clients that have a specific need for office space, based on a specific contract or project. Examples include film production teams or attorneys in the discovery process.  Services  Services typically include: * Business Support Services * Dedicated Receptionist; * Administrative Support * Telecom service * IT infrastructure and internet connectivity.  Facilities  Facilities typically include: * Conference Rooms; * Meeting Rooms; * Heating, air conditioning and other utilities; * Furniture; * Full-time security; and * Insurance  Benefits  Serviced offices may offer benefits over conventional offices for new or dynamic businesses, including: * No / low start up costs * Prestigious addresses * Flexible leasing with little notice (Duration and size) * Building Maintenance is included * Immediate availability * Support staff available as needed * Receptionist * Access to business centres worldwide * Modern fit-out and fully furnished offices * 'Bundled' packages (where one monthly payment covers most costs) are available, as are 'unbundled' (where each item used attracts a unit cost).  Shortcomings  * Many serviced offices (although not all) give a generic, unbranded impression. * In some cases there may be higher monthly cost than conventional leased space. *As the serviced industry adapts to new technologies and services that are available, the terminology also continues to evolve. \\"Flexible workspace\\" is a term favored by most industry trade organizations (e.g. Flexible Space Association) as of 2019.

(He is not to be confused with the German composer Johann Gabriel Meder, born in 1729 near Erfurt, and active in Amsterdam until 1800; nor is there evidence that the two men were related.) Meder was born in Wasungen, Thuringia to a musical family with his father and four brothers all being organists or Kantors. It is rumored that he moved to Leipzig in 1666, and began his University studies in theology there in 1669. In 1670, Meder left Leipzig to pursue continued studies at the University of Jena. Unable to secure a position there at the University, he resorted to taking a post as a professional singer in the Hofkapelle of Duke Ernst der Fromme (d. 1675).Duff, Robert. \\"The Baroque Oratorio Passion.\\" D.M.A. University of Southern California, 2000, 69-70. He was employed as court singer at Gotha in 1671, Bremen in 1672‚Äì1673, Hamburg in 1673 and Copenhagen and L√ºbeck, where in 1674 he met Buxtehude, whose work influenced Meder's own sacred compositions. From 1674 to 1680 he was Kantor at the Gymnasium at Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia).Duff, Robert. \\" The Baroque Oratorio Passion.\\" D.M.A. University of Southern California, 2000, 70. After a sojourn in Riga (now in Latvia), in 1685-1686 he succeeded Balthasar Erben as Kapellmeister at the Marienkirche in Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) in 1687. In 1698 the Danzig city council refused to allow a performance of his opera Die wiederverehligte Coelia. He had it performed instead in the nearby town of Schottland (now in Poland), which led to his being dismissed from his post. After being briefly employed as Kantor at the cathedral at K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), he went in 1700 back to Riga, where he served as Kantor until his death in 1719. (During this time, in 1710, Riga was taken over from Sweden by Russia in the Great Northern War.) According to his younger contemporary Johann Mattheson's encyclopedic Grundlage einer Ehren-Pforte, Meder was an outstanding organist and singer, as well as being a composer of repute. In spite of his location in Northeast Europe, Meder was, says Mattheson, quite familiar with 17th-century Italian music, such as that of Giacomo Carissimi and Antonio Cesti, and had learned Italian in his youth. Mattheson argued that Meder would have become the music director for the Swedish Court in Stockholm had it not been for the Great Northern War, which involved Sweden, Russia, Denmark, and Saxony-Poland-Lithuania. There are over 130 of Meder's sacred works reported in period inventories, including 37 choral works.Duff, Robert. \\" The Baroque Oratorio Passion.\\" D.M.A. University of Southern California, 2000, 74. One, a Passion oratorio from 1700, anticipates Bach by setting the words of Jesus in arioso style.

It has been suspected that the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n (GAL) death squad was involved in his murder. His half-brother Jean-Jacques Goldman is a popular French singer.  Biography  Pierre Goldman was born near the end of World War II, the son of Alter Mojze Goldman and Janine Sochaczewska, who were active in the FTP-MOI Resistance movement.Micha√´l Prazan, L'assassinat de Pierre Goldman (2005) - film documentary After the liberation of France, his parents separated, and his father, in concert with a group of former FTP-MOI members, kidnapped him. At that time, Alter said that he took Pierre so that he would not grow up in the country that had seen the elimination of so many Jews. Thereafter, he had only sporadic contact with his mother, who returned to Poland. Though he was expelled from various high schools and boarding schools, Goldman obtained his baccalaur√©at and pursued courses at the Sorbonne as an independent auditor. He joined the Union of Communist Students in 1963. In 1966, he refused to do his compulsory military service, and travelled to Cuba instead, where he heard Fidel Castro speak at the Tricontinental Conference in January 1966. Still in Havana for the funerary eve after Che Guevara's death, he met through intermediary R√©gis Debray, a number of Venezuelan guerrilleros. Returning to Paris, he remained distant from May '68 activism. In June 1968 he returned to Venezuela and spent a year there in guerrilla activities. On 11 June 1969, after the attack of an arms depot his group withdrew in the sierra, and then lost all support from Cuba which rallied with the Venezuelan government's side. Goldman then robbed the Royal Bank of Canada in Puerto La Cruz on 11 June 1969, taking 2.6 million bol√≠vars (the biggest hold-up of that year), a robbery later claimed by the FALN guerrilla. Of his comrades, only Goldman was not identified, fleeing in September to Paris. Having quickly spent his remaining money, he staged several robberies of small businesses in December 1969 and January 1970. During this period, he reportedly considered kidnapping writer Jean-Edern Hallier, whom he profoundly disliked. In 1974, he was given a life-sentence by the Paris cour d'assises after being convicted of a bloody robbery on 19 December 1969 on the Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, in which two pharmacists were killed. He denied having committed the robbery, although he admitted having conducted three earlier robberies. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison for the other three robberies and given a life sentence for the December 1969 assassination. During the five years he spent in prison, he studied philosophy and Spanish, and wrote a book on his own case, Souvenirs obscurs d'un juif polonais n√© en France ( Obscure Memories of a Polish Jew Born in France), published in 1975. The impact of the book on some French intellectuals and personalities, including the actress Simone Signoret, the writer Fran√ßoise Sagan, Jean-Paul Sartre and R√©gis Debray, among others, plus many inconsistencies recorded during the investigation led to a second trial, which started on 26 April 1976. He was acquitted and freed in October 1976. Afterward, he contributed to left-wing newspapers, joining the Temps Modernes and Lib√©ration.  Assassination  On 20 September 1979, he was assassinated at point-blank range in Paris. Eyewitnesses described seeing three Spanish- looking persons. The police first suspected the Mafia, however, the murder was vindicated by (according to AFP) an unknown far-right group: Honneur de la police (Honour of the Police). Pierre Goldman's funeral was attended by 15,000 people. A few hours after his death, his wife Christiane gave birth to a son, Manuel. The perpetrators of Pierre Goldman's murder have not been found. Various theories persist, the most serious one pointing to Marseilles' criminal underground, which might have assassinated him on behalf of the GAL ( Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n), a death squad set up by Spanish officials to fight ETA in the 1980s. Pierre Goldman was allegedly helping ETA procure weapons, and planned to create an organization to fight the GAL. Another theory shared by VSD points toward the French intelligence services -- supported by the fact that former police officer Lucien Aim√©-Blanc, in charge of the Narcotics Department, pointed to the presence of a SDECE officer in the scene. In April 2006 Lib√©ration published an interview of said former police officer, who stated that one of his informants, Jean-Pierre Ma√Øone, had admitted a few years later of having killed Goldman on behalf of the GAL:  Identity of the Assassin  On 22 May 2012, a blog post from lemonde.fr identified the killer of Pierre Goldman as Ren√© Resciniti de Says. A former paratrooper for the French Armed Forces, Resciniti de Says was known as Ren√© l'√©l√©gant and died on 17 April 2012 at the age of 61. Goldman's assassin had previously been identified under the pseudonym Gustavo by documentarian Michel Despratx in 2010. Extreme right journalist, Emmanuel Ratier, in the bimonthly newsletter Faits et Documents, claims the true identity of Gustavo to have been Ren√© Resciniti de Says. The blog post alleges that Ren√© Resciniti de Says was an associate of French monarchist group Action Fran√ßaise as well as being one of Bob Denard's mercenaries. Gustavo, the 2010 Michel Despratx documentary which was broadcast by Canal+, claims to have assassinated Goldman as part of a four-person commando squad which included an inspector of the Direction de la surveillance du territoire (DST) and a police officer of the Direction centrale des renseignements g√©n√©raux (RG). Nevertheless, as pointed out by the blog post, Gustavo's testimony and his identification as Ren√© Resciniti de Says remain to be corroborated.

It is performed by filling the defective area with a range of materials, usually a bone piece from the patient or a synthetic material. Cranioplasty is carried out by incision and reflection of the scalp after applying anaesthetics and antibiotics to the patient. The temporalis muscle is reflected, and all surrounding soft tissues are removed, thus completely exposing the cranial defect. The cranioplasty flap is placed and secured on the cranial defect. The wound is then sealed. Cranioplasty was closely related to trephination and the earliest operation is dated to 3000 BC. Currently, the procedure is performed for both cosmetic and functional purposes. Cranioplasty can restore the normal shape of the skull and prevent other complications caused by a sunken scalp, such as the \\"syndrome of the trephined\\". Cranioplasty is a risky operation, with potential risks such as bacterial infection and bone flap resorption.  Etymology  The word cranioplasty can be broken down into two parts: cranio- and -plasty. Cranio- originates from the Ancient Greek word Œ∫œÅŒ±ŒΩŒØŒøŒΩ, meaning \\"cranium\\", while -plasty comes from the Ancient Greek word œÄŒªŒ±œÉœÑœåœÇ, meaning \\"moulded\\" or \\"fashioned\\". Medical Uses The operation has its cosmetic value as the normal shape of the cranium of patients is restored instead of the presence of a sunken skin flap, which may affect the confidence of patients. It also has its therapeutic value as the operation provides structure to the skull and protection to the brain from physical damage. The surgery restores regular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebral blood flow dynamics, along with normal intracranial pressure. Cranioplasty may improve neurological function in some individuals. Furthermore, it can reduce the occurrence of headaches caused by injury or previous surgery. The optimal timing of cranioplasty is controversial among literature. Some literature stated that the time between a craniectomy and a cranioplasty is usually between 6 months to a year, while others stated that the two operations should be more than a year apart. The timing of cranioplasty is affected by multiple factors. Sufficient time is required for the recovery of the incision from the previous operation, as well as to clear any infections (both systemic and cranial). Some findings showed that a greater infection rate is associated with early cranioplasty due to interruption of wound healing, as well as an increased incidence of hydrocephalus. Contrarily, there is evidence of early cranioplasty limiting complications caused by \\"syndrome of the trephined\\", including changes in cerebral blood flow and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics. Other researchers reported no significant difference in infection rate with different operational timings. Contraindications are circumstances that indicate the treatment or operation should not be provided due to potential harm. Contraindications for cranioplasty include the presence of bacterial infection, brain swelling, and hydrocephalus. Cranioplasty is withheld until all contraindications are cleared.  Procedure  Scar remained from a cranioplasty Before the operation, CT scans and MRIs are taken to study the cranial defect. The patient is given antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection. The patient is situated on a foam donut or a horseshoe head holder for the operation. The patient is then anaesthetised and an incision is made following the incision of the previous operation. The scalp and the temporalis muscle is reflected to completely reveal the cranial defect. Significant blood loss is observed as new blood vessels formed in scar tissues are damaged by incision. Any soft tissues at the edge of the defect are removed and the defect is cleaned. The cranioplasty material is placed on the defect and is fixed to the surrounding skull with standard titanium plate and screws. CSF may be drained from the brain to reduce herniation. Small holes may be drilled on the bone graft or the prosthesis to prevent the accumulation of fluid under the repaired defect. Soft tissues, temporalis, and the scalp are then fixed back in place. Subgaleal drain and dressing are applied to control facial swelling. After the operation, a CT scan is taken and patients may stay in intensive care for at least a night for better neurological status observation, or be placed in a regular care unit. The subgaleal drain and dressing are removed before the patient is dispatched. =Children = Special considerations to children undergoing cranioplasty are made to accommodate for their growing cranium. Certain materials are more favoured when compared to adult cranioplasty. Autologous bone grafts are the most preferred materials for paediatric cranioplasty, as they are accepted by the host and the bone flap can be integrated into the body of the host. However, autologous bone pieces may be unavailable or unsuitable in certain occasions. The body size of children may be not enough to have bone flaps to be stored in their subcutaneous spaces, while cryopreservation facilities for bone grafts are not widely available. The use of autograft is also associated with a high rate of bone resorption. Synthetic materials are used for paediatric cranioplasty when the use of autografts is not available or not recommended. Hydroxyapatite is another option for children cranioplasty as it allows the expansion of cranium for children and its ability to be moulded smoothly. It is less commonly used than autografts due to its brittle nature, high infection rate, and poor ability to integrate with the human cranium. Bilateral cranioplasties are more prone to complications compared to unilateral cranioplasties in children. This may be explained by its larger scalp wound area, a higher volume of blood loss, and the higher complexity and duration of the operation.  Risks  Cranioplasty is an operation with a complication risk ranging from 15 to 41%. The cause for such a high risk of complication compared to other neurosurgical operations is unclear. Male patients and older patients are groups with higher rates of complication. Complications occurring after cranioplasty include bacterial infection, bone flap resorption, wound dehiscence, hematoma, seizures, hygroma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. The risk of bacterial infections in performing cranioplasty ranges from 5 to 12.8%. Multiple factors are affecting the risk of infection, one being the materials used for the operation. Using titanium, whether being custom-made or using a mesh, is associated with a lower infection rate; on the other hand, materials such as methyl methacrylate and autologous bone is associated with a higher infection rate. Another risk factor for bacterial infection is the location of the operation. Bifrontal cranioplasties are associated with significantly higher infection rates and higher rates for reoperation. Other risk factors for infection include previous infections, contact between sinuses and operation site, devascularized scalp (loss of blood supply in the scalp), previous operations, and type of injury. Bone resorption is another complication of cranioplasty with a complication rate of 0.7-17.4%. Bone resorption occurs when the autologous graft does not have blood supply due to devitalisation, or when scar tissues or soft tissues remain on the edge of the cranial defect during cranioplasty. Paediatric patients have a higher risk of resorption, with a resorption rate up to 50%. Bone resorption is more likely to occur in this group of patients when their cranioplasty is carried out over 6 weeks from their previous operation. Fragmented bone flaps, as well as large bone flaps (>70 cm2), are associated with a higher resorption rate. History = Ancient history = alt= The earliest cranioplasty operation is dated to 3000 BC in the Inca civilisation, where precious metals, gourds, and shells were found next to trepanned skulls in graveyards, suggesting that cranioplasty had been performed. In the Paracas region of present-day Peru, a skull from 2000 BC with a thin plate of gold covering a cranial defect was found. Moreover, defective skulls were found covered with coconut shells or palm leaves in ancient tribes of the Polynesian Islands. Sanan and Haines stated that the materials being used for cranioplasty were associated with the status of the patient. = Modern history = Research on cranioplasty was not emphasised among early surgical authors in ancient Asia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, although there were research and practice on trephination in ancient Greece and Rome. More emphasis was placed on developing skills in applying dressing on an open wound. Portrait of Gabriele Fallopius The earliest modern description of cranioplasty was written by surgeon Ibrahim bin Abdullah of the Ottoman Empire, in his surgical book Al√¢im-i Cerr√¢h√Æn in 1505. The book mentioned the use of xenografts from Kangal dogs or goats as materials for cranioplasty. Such materials were used due to the accessibility of these animals near battlefields, where the procedure is likely to be performed. The first true description of cranioplasty in Europe was made by Fallopius in the 16th century, stating that the fractured cranium should be removed and be reinserted with a gold plate if the dura was damaged. This was questioned by other practitioners at his time, concerning that surgeons may keep the gold instead of using it for surgery. The first cranioplasty was reported by the Dutch surgeon Job Janszoon van Meekeren. The report described the use of a segment of a canine cranium as a material for cranioplasty on a nobleman in Moscow. The operation was successful, however, the use of canine bone in the operation was not accepted by the church and the man was forced to leave Russia. Since the first operation, bones from more animal species were used as xenografts for cranioplasty. These include dogs, apes, geese, rabbits, calves, eagles, oxen, and buffalos. In 1917, Wiliam Wayne Babcock reported the use of \\"soup bone\\", a piece of cooked and perforated animal bone as a xenograft. = Development of modern materials = The prevalence of head injuries increased in the 20th century with the advancement of armaments, particularly the use of hand grenades in trench warfare during World War I (WWI). Along with a decreased mortality from suffering such injuries due to the development of cell debris removal, wound closing, and the use of antibiotics, cranioplasty techniques were therefore improved. Autografts, allografts and synthetic materials are the main types of materials used for cranioplasty. Sir William Macewen, who reported a case of successful autograft cranioplasty in 1885 Autografts, or autologous grafts, are body tissues taken from the patient. The first successful cranioplasty using an autograft was recorded in 1821, with the bone piece being reinserted into the cranium. The operation achieved partial healing. Subsequently, more studies and operations were carried out with autografts. A successful case of reimplantation of cranial bone was reported by Sir William Macewen in 1885, popularising autografts to be material for cranioplasty. Succeeding operations involved autografts taken from different parts of the patient's body, such as the tibia (leg bone), scapula (shoulder blade), ilium (hip bone), sternum (chest bone), along with fat tissues and fascia. Allografts are tissues from another individual of the same species. The first use of allografts was reported in 1915 with cadaver cartilage by Morestin. Subsequently, another 32 cases of cranioplasties performed with cadaver cartilage were reported by Gosset in 1916. The use of cadaver cartilage was favoured during World War I due to its malleability and resistance to infection. Its use declined because of its lack of significant calcification and strength. Cadaver skull was another type of allograft reported to be used as a cranioplasty material multiple times by Sicard and Dambrin from 1917 to 1919. The material was not favoured due to the high infection rate with its use. In the 1980s, the use of cadaver allograft disc for filling in small holes received a satisfactory result, and there was a resurgence of the use of cadaver bone. However, cadaver bones and allografts, in general, are not the preferred materials in modern operations. The use of methyl methacrylate (PMMA) for cranioplasty was being developed since World War II, and the material is used extensively since 1954, when there is a high demand for cranioplasty due to a large number of injuries. It becomes malleable when an exothermic reaction occurs between its powder form and benzoyl peroxide, allowing it to be moulded to the cranial defect. Advantages of using PMMA is its malleability, low cost, high strength and high durability. Its disadvantages include being vulnerable to infection as bacteria may adhere to its fibrous layer, as well as its brittle nature and having no growth potential. Other common synthetic materials for cranioplasty include titanium and hydroxyapatite. Titanium was first used for cranioplasty in 1965. It can be used as a plate, a mesh, and be 3D printed as a porous form. Titanium is non-ferromagnetic and non-corrosive, making the host free from inflammatory reactions. It is also robust, thus preventing patients from trauma. The use of titanium is associated with a lower infection rate. Disadvantages of using titanium include its high cost, poor malleability, and disruption to CT scan images. Hydroxyapatite is a compound of calcium phosphate being arranged in a hexagonal structure. It bonds well chemically with bones and inflicts little inflammatory reaction by the host, and has good osteointegration. It can be expanded and is used in paediatric cranioplasty. It can be moulded smoothly and has appealing cosmetic results. However, the material is brittle and has low tensile strength, and is only suitable to be used for small cranial defects. Its use is also associated with a high infection rate. Hydroxyapatite is often used with a titanium mesh to prevent fractures and for better osteointegration.

The title of the book was Historia novellamente ritrovata di due nobili amanti (\\"Newly found story of two noble lovers\\"), published posthumously and anonymously about 1531 in Venice and dedicated to his cousin Lucina Savorgnan. The origin of the story of the two unlucky lovers is disputed, however Da Porto probably took the inspiration from a tale by Masuccio Salernitano called Mariotto e Ganozza, introducing many modern elements reprised by Shakespeare's drama. Some inspiration may have stemmed from da Porto's own experiences: in 1511, he apparently fell in love with the sixteen-year-old Lucina Sarvognan who enchanted a Venetian ball with her singing. The conflicts between and within Friulian clans were however at a critical point. Da Porto was very close to his uncle Antonio Savorgnan, unfortunately though, when he met Lucina, Antonio's relationship with her guardian Girolamo Savorgnan was at a nadir. Years later, badly wounded and paralyzed from his battles, Luigi wrote the novella in his villa. Although the setting of the story is Verona, the inspiration for the idea of two warring families came from the two castles of Montecchio Maggiore, which he could see from his window in his villa. He dedicated the work to Lucina, who by then had been married off to someone else. Da Porto set the story in Verona (at that time, a strategic city for Venice), in the age of Bartolomeo della Scala (1301‚Äì1304). He created the names of Romeo (later Romeus) and Giulietta (soon to be Juliet in England) and even created the characters of Mercutio, Tybalt, Friar Laurence, and Paris.

Its interior is now stripped of its adornments. Maio of Bari () (died 10 November 1160) was the third of the great admirals of Sicily and the most important man in the Norman kingdom of Sicily during the reign of William I (1154‚Äì66). Lord Norwich calls him \\"one of the most influential statesmen in Europe.\\" Rise to the rank of admiral Maio was born in the first decades of the twelfth century to Leo of Rayza and Kuraza, members of the urban upper class in Bari. Leo is documented as a judge in Bari between 1119 and 1135, as a royal justice from 1141 and as a regalis supra iudex (\\"royal superior judge\\") or protoiudex (\\"first judge\\") from 1142 to 1147. He was dead by 1155. The death of Maio's mother, Kuraza, is recorded in the necrology of the cathedral of Salerno as falling on 26 July 1158. The contemporary Liber de regno sicilie, a partisan source, falsely claims that Maio was the son of an oil merchant. In his Chronicle and Annals, Romuald Guarna (died 1181/2), a partisan of the other side, calls Maio \\"certainly an eloquent, fully honest and discreet man\\" (vir utique facundus, satis providus et discretus).Berardo Pio, \\"Maione da Bari\\", Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani 67 (Rome: 2007). Maio is first documented as the royal scriniarius, the official in charge of the archive of the royal court (curia regia), in a royal concession to the monastery of Santa Maria Maddalena di Valle Giosafat in October 1144. Down to February 1148 he continued to witness documents, always as scriniarius, whenever the chancellor, Robert of Selby, was absent. The written record attests that he was constantly present with the court at either Messina or Palermo during this period. In 1149 he was granted the title \\"vice-chancellor\\" (vicecancellarius), which appears to have been created specifically for him. His new rank probably reflected a change in status, from that of a functionary internal to the chancery to a more clearly defined role in the government. After the death of Robert of Selby he was promoted to head the chancery. He first appears with the title of \\"chancellor\\" (cancellarius) in May 1152, in an Arabic-language document of the duana regia (or dƒ´wƒÅn al- ma‚Äôm≈´r), the office which controlled the royal fisc, concerning a dispute between the monastery of San Giorgio di Triocala and the lord of Calamonaci. After the deposition and execution of the admiral Philip of Mahdia (1153), the admiralcy was vacant for a year. Shortly after his coronation (4 April 1154), King William I appointed Maio to the rank of \\"admiral of admirals\\" (amiratus amiratorum). In June 1154 he subscribed to an official copy of a donation of land and serfs to the monastery of San Nicol√≤ del Churchuro from 1149. Between October 1154 and May 1160 Maio's standard title was magnus [great] ammiratus ammiratorum. Although this title, derived from the Arabic amir al-umarƒÅ‚Äô (literally \\"emir of emirs\\"), evolved into a purely military one (c.f. admiral), in Maio's time it was an administrative title. The Arabic writer Ibn al-Athƒ´r, who called Maio a \\"sad governor\\" for his role in the rebellion against William I, translated his title as vizier. Heading the government Maio was not popular with the baronage and supported the immigration of Western Europeans, Roman Catholics all, to increase the influence of that church, which was his largest supporter (at first). The chiefest of baronial opponent to Maio was, at first, Robert de Bassonville, the count of Loritello and cousin to the king. He resented Maio's rise and his own cousin's royal powers. He joined with a Byzantine army under Michael Palaeologus in 1155 and took Bari. At that time, the king fell ill and remained so from September to Christmas. Maio and Hugh, Archbishop of Palermo, took control of the kingdom in the meanwhile. It was then, with revolt spreading in the peninsula, that insurrection began in the island. A conspiracy formed to overthrow both Maio and the king. Maio refused to panic and the major revolts were soon dead. However, a revolt led by one Bartholomew of Garsiliato took Butera, on Sicily, and proceeded to declare themselves in armed insurrection. The rebels demanded the king remove Maio and the archbishop from his inner circle. William refused. The rebels stirred up riots in the capital of Palermo itself, where the people demanded the release of Count Simon of Policastro, whom Maio had imprisoned without trial. William negotiated himself out of the bind and Maio remained his right-hand man, though Maio's own right-hand, Asclettin, the chancellor, was imprisoned by the king. In 1156, it was Maio who was primarily responsible for the Treaty of Benevento which ended hostilities between Sicily and the Holy See and preserved for William the legatine powers granted originally to his father. The newfound alliance with Adrian IV made the Sicilians enemies, inevitably, of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Maio may have even been present at the formation of the Lombard League, as an envoy of William's. Maio's concentration on events to the north, however, proved the downfall of the African possessions of the crown. On 11 January 1160, Mahdia surrendered and Maio received a lot of the blame. His unpopularity peaked, but so did his power. His enemies spread rumours that he was aiming to seize the crown, that he had already seized the regalia with the help of Queen Margaret, with whom he was certainly in bed, and that he was even planning the king's assassination: with the help of the pope. Certainly all such allegations were patent nonsense, but a conspiracy arose on the peninsula around one Matthew Bonnellus, who planned to assassinate the admiral himself. Bonnellus was an intimate of Maio, who wished to marry his daughter to him, and therefore well-positioned to strike the undoing blow. While Maio prepared a wedding, Bonnellus prepared an assassination. On 10 November 1160, in the street called Via Coperta, Bonnellus and his conspirators stabbed Maio to death and severely wounded his chief prot√©g√©, Matthew of Ajello. Maio's wife and children were quickly whisked away as a mob descended on his palace. It was a brutal end. Maio's influence as a courtier of William was great. His administration is noted primarily for consolidating the centralisation begun under the first two Rogers. Though he neglected the widespread conquests (wrought largely by George of Antioch) of the kingdom, he assured a stability that proved after his death to be very volatile. The King's confidence in him was so great as to result in the nomination of his brother Stephen and his brother-in-law Simon to high posts of captain in Apulia and seneschal. According to his enemy the chronicler \\"Hugo Falcandus\\" put it: Maio wrote an \\"Exposition of the Lord's Prayer\\" in the scholastic tradition. Notes Sources Alio, Jacqueline.

Conceived primarily as a holding company, National Packing soon began buying up smaller meat companies, such as G. H. Hammond and Fowler. Between 1904 and 1910, National Packing acquired 23 stockyards and slaughtering plants nationwide, which gave it control over about one-tenth of U.S. meat production. The company owned branches in over 150 cities around the world, along with a fleet of 2,600 refrigerated railcars.

He was born in Frick, Canton Aargau, Switzerland. He received his higher education, and later qualified as a veterinarian, in Zurich. In 1891 Theiler travelled to South Africa and at first found employment as a farm worker on Irene Estates near Pretoria, owned by Nellmapius, but later that year started practising as a veterinarian. His success at producing a vaccine to combat an outbreak of smallpox among the miners of the Witwatersrand brought him an appointment as state veterinarian for the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, in which capacity he served during the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902. During this period his research team developed a vaccine against rinderpest, a malignant and contagious disease of cattle. His tremendous energy, pioneering spirit and professional integrity brought him international recognition. He described in 1919 what is now known as Theiler's disease (acute serum hepatitis, postvaccination hepatitis or idiopathic acute hepatic disease) - one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in horses - when he observed the symptoms of liver disease in animals vaccinated against African horse sickness with a combination of live virus and equine antiserum.Theiler A (1919) Acute liver-atrophy and parenchymatous hepatitis in horses.

This institute under his leadership carried out research on African horse sickness, sleeping sickness, malaria, East Coast fever (Theileria parva) and tick-borne diseases such as redwater, heartwater and biliary. The University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science was established there in 1920 which enabled veterinarians to train locally for the first time. Theiler became the first dean of this faculty.

Actor Van Hansis is most recognized for his portrayal of Luke from his debut in December 2005 until the series finale in September 2010. Luke was born to Lily Walsh and Damian Grimaldi, and was subsequently raised by Lily and Holden Snyder (see Holden Snyder and Lily Walsh). When Luke became a teenager, he came out to his parents Lily and Holden that he was gay. Eventually they accepted him. He is also part of soap opera's first gay supercouple, Luke Snyder and Noah Mayer, also known as \\"Nuke\\" (Noah, Luke). Casting The role of Luke Snyder was acted by several child actors from his debut in 1995 until 2001, when the character was SORASed with actor, Christopher Tavani. In March 2005, actor Jake Weary stepped into the role of a once again SORASed character of Luke. Weary announced his decision to leave the series; this announcement led to rumors of the actor and his mother, Guiding Light actress Kim Zimmer leaving due to the character's upcoming coming out storyline. Zimmer denied such rumors, simply stating that Weary, who at the time was 15, wouldn't be able to dedicate the time needed for the storyline. He instead decided to focus on his school work. On December 14, 2005 Van Hansis succeeded Weary in the role. Hansis would portray Luke until the series finale in 2010. Character description Luke is extremely honest, forthright and occasionally sarcastic. At best he's passionate, assertive and perceptive. At his worst he's overbearing, irrational and moody. He values his relationships highly and is very considerate, often putting the needs of others before himself. He's comfortable in both the rich and privileged world of the Walsh and Grimaldi families and the more down-to-earth atmosphere of the Snyder family. Despite being confident in his sexuality, Luke has shown himself to be extremely insecure at times, several times irrationally so. This is especially noticeable when it comes to his relationship with Noah Mayer. Luke came out as a gay teenager, dealt with bullying, and eventually gained the support of his parents and family. However it has left him very sensitive about his sexuality. After a somewhat tumultuous long-term relationship with first love, Noah Mayer, that relationship ended. Luke began developing feelings for neurosurgeon, Dr. Reid Oliver, who was in town because Luke had blackmailed him to treat Noah. However, this was complicated by Noah wanting to restart his relationship with Luke. The show was cancelled before this storyline could play out. Character history =1995‚Äì2005= When Luke was born, his mother Lily Walsh did not know whether his father was her then-spouse Damian Grimaldi or her lover Holden Snyder. Although Damian proved to be the father, the two men struggled over possession of the boy for years before Holden ‚Äì who had married Lily some years earlier ‚Äì adopted Luke. When Luke was a teenager, he confessed to the murder of Julia Larrabee, who he blamed for breaking up his parents' marriage, to protect his mother, who he thought was guilty of the crime. When the true killer was found to be somebody else, his life did not return to normalcy; as his mother began dating another man, Keith Morrissey, Luke became an alcoholic. Following her son's kidney failure, Lily was blackmailed into promising to marry Keith by his promise of a new kidney for Luke, but after Luke's passionate appeal to Keith he released her from her vow. Luke's family was left intact, but Luke's problems were not over, as he continued seeing destructive friends and accidentally hit a pedestrian, Jade Taylor, with his car. =2005‚Äì07= Luke trusted Jade, who claims to everyone that she is Luke's cousin, enough to reveal his deepest secret to her ‚Äì his romantic love for Kevin ‚Äì she turned out to be a fraud, forcing him to pretend to be in love with her. Unfortunately, this destroys his relationship with Kevin. A desperate Luke comes out to his friend Will Munson before, on Will's advice, revealing his secret to his family. While a pregnant Lily can't accept her eldest son's sexual orientation, the rest of his family supports him. Shortly after his surprise reappearance in their lives, Luke's birth father Damian tries to send Luke to a gender re-alignment camp. When Lily realizes the nature of the camp, she tries to reassure Luke that she will accept him, but thinking her the sole responsible party he lashes out angrily at her for her betrayal, inadvertently knocking her down the stairs. She lapses into a coma. Holden will not accept Luke's explanation for what happened, and Luke takes shelter from his adoptive father's anger with Damian. He grows closer to Damian especially when Damian claims to be dying...but it all falls apart when he later discovers the truth of his father's health. He severs ties with his birth father, changing his name, but yields his share in the Grimaldi family fortune to Damian before he goes. Back home, Luke comes out to his friends. While Kevin has difficulty at first, he reconciles with Luke after Luke saves his life. Lily, who gave birth while in her coma, finally emerges to also reconcile with Luke and, to everyone's surprise, Jade turns out not to be a fraud after all. =2007‚Äì10= While interning at WOAK, Luke meets and falls for Noah Mayer. Noah is dating Luke's friend Maddie Coleman, but soon after Luke reveals his feelings to Noah, he begins to struggle with his own attraction. Eventually, he acknowledges that he is also gay, although he fears revealing this to his father. Unfortunately, Colonel Mayer learns the secret when he catches them in their second kiss and rejects Noah before devising a plan to murder Luke. His efforts leave Luke paralyzed for a time, although physical therapy eventually puts him back on his feet. In spite of Colonel Mayer's plans, he and Noah remain a couple. Their relationship is challenged when Noah, to save a young Iraqi woman with connections to his father from deportation, decides to marry her. Although he weds Ameera Ali Aziz, Noah reassures Luke of his steadfast love, but the relationship eventually instigates a break-up of the pair after Colonel Mayer is seemingly killed in a kidnapping plot and Ameera arrested. Noah blames Luke for the events, and Luke is angry that Noah requests time apart. The pair reconcile after a visit from Cyndi Lauper, who dedicates a performance of the song \\"True Colors\\" to them. When Damian returns a portion of Luke's inheritance to him, he decides to start a charitable foundation, run by Brian Wheatley, who encourages Luke to be more discreet in his homosexuality to avoid alienating the philanthropic community. He also enters politics, running against his old friend Kevin for President of the Student Government at Oakdale U. He winds up cheating to overcome a dirty campaign by Kevin and is expelled when Noah comes clean to the dean about what Luke did. When Noah leaves him because of this, Luke begins drinking again and while drunk is kissed by Brian, who has married Luke's grandmother Lucinda. Later, when Luke is living at Holden's house and Brian and Lucinda must come to stay with them, does Brian confess that, while attracted to Luke, he loves Lucinda. In spite of their agreement, this will not remain secret long. Luke and Noah are struggling to reconnect, but when Luke is jealous of Noah's continued relationship with Maddie, he kisses Brian himself. Noah, who sees this, is angry with Luke for some time, and Lucinda is soon angry as well when Jade blurts out the secret. Ostracized, Brian comes very close to suicide before Luke and Noah can intervene, but after their intervention, he makes peace with Lucinda and his own homosexuality before leaving town. Luke turns his Luke Snyder Foundation to LGBT rights after he and Noah are discriminated against in their housing search, but his personal life is complicated when Damian returns, ostensibly to make amends, and when a couple of men he takes on as volunteers for his Foundation prove to be con-men after money, kidnapping first Noah and then Luke. Damian saves them both and remarries Lily, but flees the country mysteriously soon after. When Noah is blinded in an accident at film school, he grows distant with Luke, feeling a need to be independent and continuously holding Luke responsible for what happened. Tired of being pushed away and blamed for Noah's accident Luke ends things with Noah. Now single, Luke falls in love with neurosurgeon Reid Oliver, who is working to save Noah's sight. Their relationship starts out a bit rocky when Noah gets his sight back and decides he wants to reunite with Luke. Feeling loyalty toward Noah, and guilt for falling for his doctor, Luke has a hard time figuring out who he should be with. In the end, however, he decides to pursue his relationship with Reid. Soon after, Noah receives a grant to make a movie in Los Angeles and tries to convince Luke to go with him. He tells him he cannot go and ultimately comes to the conclusion that while they did love each other, they weren't right for each other (while Luke and Reid are). Tragically, Reid is mortally injured when his car is struck by a train. When Reid dies not long before he is set to leave for LA, Noah is convinced by Allison to comfort Luke, but while he is willing to remain in Oakdale during his time in need, Luke urges him to pursue his dream. They agree that they will visit, but when Noah expresses his hope that one day may finally unite, Luke seems noncommittal about it. Noah leaves and Luke continues to grieve Reid. In his last scene Katie, Reid's best friend and roommate, gives Luke his stethoscope saying Reid would want him to have it. Luke asks Chris, the man who received Reid's heart after he died, if he could use it to listen to his heartbeat. He says it's okay and the final shot we ever have of Luke is of him listening to Reid's heart with a sad smile on his face.

Her lifelong quest was for biblical affirmation of the integrity and equality of women, and she published God's Word to Women as a retranslation of the Bible. As a missionary and a doctor, Bushnell worked to reform conditions of human degradation in North America, Europe, and Asia. She was recognized as a forceful and even charismatic speaker.  Early life and education  Born February 5, 1856, in Evanston, Illinois, or ‚Äúthe great Methodist mecca of the northwest,‚Äù Bushnell's roots in Christianity were well established from the beginning. She grew up in the midst of a religious transition; Methodists in her community were striving to be faithful in every area of their lives while simultaneously craving popular success. With this transition came a shift in focus from the individual to the community as a whole, a change in philosophy which ultimately affected Bushnell's life path. Bushnell showed the desire to further her education from an early age and attended Women's Northwestern College‚Äînow known as Northwestern University‚Äîfrom 1873‚Äì1874. Here, she studied under Dean Francis Willard, who inspired Bushnell to pursue a career in social justice. After Northwestern, Bushnell found another mentor in Dr. James Stewart Jewell. The catalyst behind her interest in medicine, Dr. Jewell convinced Bushnell to study medicine at Chicago Women's Medical College, where she specialized in nerve disorders. A driven and intelligent student, she graduated three years ahead of her peers. After obtaining her undergraduate and graduate degrees, Bushnell initially planned on entering postgraduate study but was persuaded by her home church to go to China as a medical missionary in 1879.  Early career  = China = Bushnell served as a medical doctor in Kiukiang, China from 1879‚Äì1882. Upon arrival, her original plan was to postpone setting up her practice and to get her affairs in order first and learn the native tongue. However, she was quickly overwhelmed with visitors seeking medical attention and, finding that she could not refuse their entreaties, treated hundreds of patients. In response to her friend's thriving practice, Dr. Ella Gilchrist came out to China to assist Bushnell, but the hot summers proved to be intolerable. In 1882, both women fell ill and soon after they were forced to return home. Quite discouraged by this mission cut short, Bushnell left feeling that \\"her whole life had been a failure.\\" Yet it was in China that she first became inspired to study Biblical translations. Brushing aside Chinese traditional medicines, Bushnell nevertheless examined Chinese culture more closely than missionaries who had gone before her. She noticed with indignation that the Chinese Bible changed Paul's fellows from women to men, and after that vowed to devote a portion of her life solely to \\"a meticulous examination of male bias that had corrupted the English text.\\" While it is not confirmed, many sources claim that Bushnell established a pediatric hospital sponsored by the Woman's Mission Board of the Methodist Episcopal Church. = America =  Women's Christian Temperance Union  Upon Bushnell and Gilchrist's return from China, both women were looking for a cause that they could stand behind. After disappointment with their recently established American medical practice, the pair joined the Women's Christian Temperance Union, or the WCTU. Bushnell returned to her former mentor Willard and became the National Evangelist of the Department of Social Purity. \\"The largest women's organization of its time,\\" the WCTU championed the causes of families and wives and campaigned to outlaw alcohol, believed to be the root of evil. This reform movement coexisted with the social purity movement, which sought to level the playing field of men and women by raising men's moral standards rather than lowering women's. Bushnell authored The Woman Condemned, a booklet in which she claimed that ‚Äúthe myth of female virtue only exacerbated the hostile legal environment;\\" rather than protecting women, the feminization of virtue harmed them. In her work, she accused men who called themselves godly yet did not hold themselves to biblical standards of behavior.  Wisconsin  She attracted the most attention for her Wisconsin Crusade in 1888 against the \\"white slave trade.\\" Bushnell ignored regional authorities who insisted that it was nonexistent and investigated herself, drawing the conclusion that prostitution in Wisconsin was exploitative and forced. After she succeeded in exposing the prostitution system as unjust, many attempts were made to slander her and take her words out of context, defaming her for creating \\"cruel lies.\\" In response, Bushnell ordered all of her followers to believe only what she herself published. In 1887, Wisconsin passed Senate Bill 46, affectionately termed the ‚ÄúKate Bushnell Bill‚Äù by her supporters. This piece of legislature made it a federal crime to abduct unmarried women for the purpose of prostitution and even contained provisions within the bill for mentally disabled women in order to ensure the safety of all women.Hoppin, Ruth. \\"The Legacy of Katharine Bushnell\\". Accessed 23 Feb 2013  Global mission work  Frustrated by her newfound notoriety and convinced that her status as somewhat of a celebrity distracted people from reform, Bushnell became a global missionary. For guidance, she wrote to Josephine Butler, a more experienced reformer than herself. Butler encouraged her to go to India, and in 1891 Bushnell brought her friend Elizabeth Andrew along with her. Unlike Bushnell, Andrew ‚Äústruggled to shed her prejudice against ‚Äòfallen women‚Äô‚Äù and for a time had difficulty in interacting with prostitutes the pair encountered. From 1891-1893, the two conducted the Indian investigations into prostitution within British camps in colonial India. At the time of Bushnell and Andrew‚Äôs visit in the early 1890s, there were around 100 military cantonments in India under the control and ownership of Great Britain. With India having the greatest British military presence at about 1000 soldiers per regiment, leaders became worried about the potential outburst of the soldiers due to the lack of a sexual outlet. When the rate of venereal diseases continued to rise alarmingly among the men stationed in India, the British government realized that it was ineffective to merely turn the other way when military men consorted with sex workers, especially when they were paying the soldiers and covering the costs of their consistent transfers and travel expenses. Thus, the Contagious Diseases Acts were instituted in 1864. Women suspected of being prostitutes or carrying venereal diseases could be arrested and sent to lock hospitals to suffer a series of traumatic experiences described by Bushnell and Andrews as follows: The concern was with the potential contamination of British troops rather than the potential spread of foreign diseases among the native population, a point which Bushnell and Andrews emphasize. The pair published The Queen‚Äôs Daughters in India, a comprehensive account of their travels throughout India, in 1899. The inspiration for the title came from the missionaries' belief that ‚Äúthe Queen herself must not approve of the measures, ‚Äòfor she has daughters of her own; and she cares for her daughters in India also.'\\" The report consists of the two reformers' descriptions of the harrowing events which took place and their seemingly miraculous entrance into the cantonments. Since the commanding officer of a cantonment has the authority to remove anyone from the garrison at any time for any reason, the women had to step carefully and be sure not to raise suspicion. Furthermore, while they never explicitly lied about their intentions in visiting, they also never explicitly stated their purpose, allowing the officers and the women in charge of running the brothels‚Äîthe mahaldarnis‚Äîto assume that they were there for an evangelical or medical purpose rather than investigative.The women's efforts led to a reprimand for Lord Roberts, the Commander-in-Chief, India. They coauthored two books about their experiences, The Queen's Daughters in India and Heathen Slaves and Christian Rulers. The British government subsequently commissioned her to look into the opium trade between India and China.Kroeger, Catherine C. \\"The Legacy of Katherine Bushnell: a Hermeneutic for Women of Faith.\\" Priscilla Papers, Fall 1995. Available through Christians for Biblical Equality  God's Word to Women  Throughout the nineteenth century, women struggled with \\"oppressive interpretations of the Bible that deprived them of their power and dignity.\\" Bushnell has been called the most prominent voice declaring the Bible as liberating of women. Her classic book, God's Word to Women,Bushnell, Katherine. God's Word to Women. Minneapolis: Christians for Biblical Equality, 2003. was first published in book form in 1921. At the time she was 65 years old. God's Word to Women began as a correspondence course in 1908. In 1916, the loose single sheets were bound into two paper-covered volumes, which evolved into the cloth-bound 1921 edition. The book created a stir in America and elsewhere. It did not have mass appeal when first published because of its scholarly content and the few scholars interested in the topic. It relies on translation of ancient Hebrew and Koine Greek and ancient Hebrew culture. However, the book is now valued highly by Christian egalitarian scholars. It is now in public domain and is available online both electronically and in print. It has been termed a groundbreaking study of what the Bible really says about women. The book is a culmination of her life's work. It was compiled from a correspondence course of the same name. In it, she works through every biblical portion interpreted to mean that women are inferior to men. This included the topics of women not being allowed to preach, required subordination to their husbands, polygamy, and head coverings. She wrote that male-biased mistranslations of the Bible, instead of \\"hastening the coming of the day of God, are hindering the preparation for that coming.\\" The scriptural status of women continued to be of intense concern to her. Bushnell believed that mistranslations were responsible for the social and spiritual subjugation of women. As may be seen in the above quotation, she was very \\"plain-spoken\\" in her writing. Further, she wrote, God does not approve \\"that law which places Jehovah in a position secondary to her husband in a wife's life.\\" In another passage from her book, she courageously wrote:  Death  Bushnell died on January 26, 1946, only a few days before her 91st birthday.

History Building of the palace commenced in 1685 and continued for decades. The work was finished in 1784 or 1785 CE. The palace was damaged by an earthquake in 1840 and for some time abandoned, but partly restored over the next 20 years. It was again damaged during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). The structure was later used by Russians and during World War I when it was damaged by gunfire. Later, the palace was used as the administrative centre for the area, and later as a military fort until 1937. Additional damage was caused later when stone from the building was taken for use to build new homes.Ishak Pasha Palace In 2000, the palace was added to the UNESCO Tentative List of World Heritage Sites. The UNESCO summary states: > Palace on the Silk Route near the Iranian frontier ...

In During a subsequent restoration, a new roof was added, as well as a shelter over some parts of the palace, made of wood and glass.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C1Wa1PHuI Ishak Pasha Palace Dogubeyazit, Turkey] Naturally, this changed the historic character of the palace. Another restoration started in 2011.

Ports to the Atari 8-bit family, Commodore VIC-20, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, Intellivision, and ColecoVision followed. Gameplay Players are tasked with controlling a helicopter and army doctors at varying points, with the mobile army surgical hospital (M*A*S*H) team rescuing wounded to take back to the M*A*S*H 4077. The game is compatible with speech synthesizers, and at times will have characters speaking certain phrases, such as \\"butterfingers,\\" during certain events. Development and release M*A*S*H began development as part of an initiative by Frank O'Connell and Paul Carter, who collaborated to create the studio Fox Video Games in April 1982. The company pushed \\"aggressively\\" to create and market home video games. O'Connell stated that his first major acquisition was getting the rights to make a M*A*S*H video game. The game was designed by Doug Neubauer. M*A*S*H received heavier promotion than other titles released by Fox Video, and was promoted under Fox's \\"Games of the Century\\" banner. Jamie Farr, who portrayed Maxwell Klinger on the M*A*S*H TV series, was the official spokesperson for the video game. In September 1983, it was announced that M*A*S*H would receive a price cut, having the price cut by half. O'Connell stated that one of the reasons for this decision was due to concern by retailers that shelves are over-saturated by Atari 2600 games, hoping that the price would create better sell-through and improve the market. O'Connell argues that the price drop is significant, as the game dropped in price faster than other titles tend to do on the platform. A contest was held, where the person who came up with the best premise for a M*A*S*H 2 would receive $25,000 USD, with an entry included in copies of the game as well as a M*A*S*H t-shirt. Other prizes for those who did not win the money include AMC Jeeps, Texas Instruments 99/4 A home computers, and video games released by Fox Video Games. Despite this contest, a sequel never materialized. Reception Marc Berman for Electronic Fun with Computers & Games felt the game trivialized the war; they found it \\"heartless\\" given how \\"gruesome\\" the war was, and that lacking the humanity present in the show and film. Despite this, Berman still found the gameplay \\"terrific.\\" An author for the \\"Addison-Wesley Book Of Atari Software 1984\\" found the game boring, agreeing with Berman that the lack of the show's humor and personalities was a problem. An author for Computer And Video Games felt that the visuals and audio were \\"well simulated,\\" though found that controlling a scalpel using a joystick was less responsive than it was on a keyboard.

She first became controversial when she began advocating that patients be tested for AIDS prior to surgery. In the 2000s she started to promote an alternative cancer treatment program, which has attracted criticism as being misleading and dangerous.  Life  Day graduated from the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine in 1969 and trained in orthopedic surgery at two San Francisco hospitals. She became an associate professor and vice chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine and Chief of Orthopedic Surgery at San Francisco General Hospital. During the mid-1980s, she received considerable media attention related to public discussions of the risks of acquiring AIDS through exposure to the blood of AIDS patients during trauma surgery. One action she proposed was wearing the airborne protection suit that is usually worn to protect vulnerable patients from a doctor's germs. She published a book, AIDS: What the Government Isn't Telling You, wherein she states that in 1989 she retired from surgery because of the allegedly excessive risk of acquiring AIDS. Day remarried later to former California congressman William Dannemeyer. She has two sons and granddaughters.  Alternative cancer treatment  As a promoter of alternative medicine she claims to have discovered the cause and cure of cancer, as a result of God showing her how to recover from her own cancer with a 10 step plan.

Mises emigrated from Austria to the United States in 1940. Since the mid-20th century, libertarian movements have been strongly influenced by Mises's writings. Mises' student Friedrich Hayek viewed Mises as one of the major figures in the revival of classical liberalism in the post- war era. Hayek's work \\"The Transmission of the Ideals of Freedom\\" (1951) pays high tribute to the influence of Mises in the 20th century libertarian movement. Mises's Private Seminar was a leading group of economists. Many of its alumni, including Hayek and Oskar Morgenstern, emigrated from Austria to the United States and Great Britain.

During World War I, Mises served as a front officer in the Austro- Hungarian artillery and as an economic adviser to the War Department. Mises was chief economist for the Austrian Chamber of Commerce and was an economic adviser of Engelbert Dollfuss, the austrofascist but strongly anti-Nazi Austrian Chancellor. Later, Mises was economic adviser to Otto von Habsburg, the Christian democratic politician and claimant to the throne of Austria (which had been legally abolished in 1918 following the Great War).Mises, Margit von, My Years with Ludwig von Mises, Arlington House Publishers, 1976; 2nd enlarged ed., Cedar Falls, IA: Center for Futures Education, 1984. . In 1934, Mises left Austria for Geneva, Switzerland, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940. While in Switzerland, Mises married Margit Herzfeld Ser√©ny, a former actress and widow of Ferdinand Ser√©ny. She was the mother of Gitta Sereny. = Work in the United States = In 1940, Mises and his wife fled the German advance in Europe and emigrated to New York City in the United States. He had come to the United States under a grant by the Rockefeller Foundation. Like many other classical liberal scholars who fled to the United States, he received support by the William Volker Fund to obtain a position in American universities. Mises became a visiting professor at New York University and held this position from 1945 until his retirement in 1969, though he was not salaried by the university. Businessman and libertarian commentator Lawrence Fertig, a member of the New York University Board of Trustees, funded Mises and his work.Moss, Laurence S. \\"Introduction\\". The Economics of Ludwig von Mises: Toward a Critical Reappraisal. Sheed and Ward, 1976.North, Gary. \\"Mises on Money\\". LewRockwell.com. 21 January 2002 For part of this period, Mises studied currency issues for the Pan-Europa movement, which was led by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, a fellow New York University faculty member and Austrian exile. In 1947, Mises became one of the founding members of the Mont Pelerin Society. In 1962, Mises received the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art for political economy Kurien Society of Science and Art website, Listing of recipients of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art; Google Translated page, accessed June 5, 2013. at the Austrian Embassy in Washington, D.C. Mises retired from teaching at the age of 87Rothbard, Murray, Ludwig von Mises: Scholar, Creator, Hero, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988, p. 61. and died at the age of 92 in New York. He is buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Grove City College houses the 20,000-page archive of Mises papers and unpublished works.Austrian Student Scholars Conference Announcement, Grove City College website, 2013, accessed June 8, 2013. The personal library of Mises was given to Hillsdale College as bequeathed in his will.http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/upldbook514pdf.pdf At one time, Mises praised the work of writer Ayn Rand and she generally looked on his work with favor, but the two had a volatile relationship, with strong disagreements for example over the moral basis of capitalism. Contributions and influence in economics Mises wrote and lectured extensively on behalf of classical liberalism.For example, Murray Rothbard, a leading Austrian school economist, has written that, by the 1920s, \\"Mises was clearly the outstanding bearer of the great Austrian tradition.\\" Ludwig von Mises: Scholar, Creator, Hero, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988, p. 25. In his magnum opus Human Action, Mises adopted praxeology as a general conceptual foundation of the social sciences and set forth his methodological approach to economics. Mises was for economic non-interventionism and was an anti- imperialist. He referred to the Great War as such a watershed event in human history and wrote that \\"war has become more fearful and destructive than ever before because it is now waged with all the means of the highly developed technique that the free economy has created. Bourgeois civilization has built railroads and electric power plants, has invented explosives and airplanes, in order to create wealth. Imperialism has placed the tools of peace in the service of destruction. With modern means it would be easy to wipe out humanity at one blow.\\" In 1920, Mises introduced in an article his Economic Calculation Problem as a critique of socialisms which are based on planned economies and renunciations of the price mechanism. In his first article \\"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth\\", Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual subjective values are translated into the objective information necessary for rational allocation of resources in society. Mises argued that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if a public entity owned all the means of production, no rational prices could be obtained for capital goods as they were merely internal transfers of goods and not \\"objects of exchange\\", unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily irrational, as the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently. He wrote that \\"rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth\\". Mises developed his critique of socialism more completely in his 1922 book Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis, arguing that the market price system is an expression of praxeology and can not be replicated by any form of bureaucracy. Friends and students of Mises in Europe included Wilhelm R√∂pke and Alfred M√ºller-Armack (advisors to German chancellor Ludwig Erhard), Jacques Rueff (monetary advisor to Charles de Gaulle), Gottfried Haberler (later a professor at Harvard), Lionel, Lord Robbins (of the London School of Economics), Italian President Luigi Einaudi, and Leonid Hurwicz, recipient of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.Rothbard, Murray, Ludwig von Mises: Scholar, Creator, Hero, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988, p. 67. Economist and political theorist Friedrich Hayek first came to know Mises while working as his subordinate at a government office dealing with Austria's post-World War I debt. While toasting Mises at a party in 1956, Hayek said: \\"I came to know him as one of the best educated and informed men I have ever known\\". Mises's seminars in Vienna fostered lively discussion among established economists there. The meetings were also visited by other important economists who happened to be traveling through Vienna. At his New York University seminar and at informal meetings at his apartment, Mises attracted college and high school students who had heard of his European reputation. They listened while he gave carefully prepared lectures from notes. pp. 66‚Äì67.Reisman, George, Capitalism: a Treatise on Economics, \\"Introduction,\\" Jameson Books, 1996; and Mises, Margit von, My Years with Ludwig von Mises, 2nd enlarged edit., Center for Future Education, 1984, pp. 136‚Äì37. Among those who attended his informal seminar over the course of two decades in New York were Israel Kirzner, Hans Sennholz, Ralph Raico, Leonard Liggio, George Reisman and Murray Rothbard.On Mises's influence, see Rothbard, Murray, The Essential Ludwig von Mises, 2nd printing, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1983; on Eastman's conversion \\"from Marx to Mises,\\" see Diggins, John P., Up From Communism Harper & Row, 1975, pp. 201‚Äì33; on Mises's students and seminar attendees, see Mises, Margit von, My Years with Ludwig von Mises, Arlington House, 1976, 2nd enlarged edit., Center for Future Education, 1984. Mises's work also influenced other Americans, including Benjamin Anderson, Leonard Read, Henry Hazlitt, Max Eastman, legal scholar Sylvester J. Petro and novelist Ayn Rand.  Reception  = Debates about Mises's arguments = Economic historian Bruce Caldwell wrote that in the mid-20th century, with the ascendance of positivism and Keynesianism, Mises came to be regarded by many as the \\"archetypal 'unscientific' economist\\". In a 1957 review of his book The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality, The Economist said of Mises: \\"Professor von Mises has a splendid analytical mind and an admirable passion for liberty; but as a student of human nature he is worse than null and as a debater he is of Hyde Park standard\\".\\"Liberalism in Caricature\\", The Economist Conservative commentator Whittaker Chambers published a similarly negative review of that book in the National Review, stating that Mises's thesis that anti-capitalist sentiment was rooted in \\"envy\\" epitomized \\"know-nothing conservatism\\" at its \\"know-nothingest\\".Quoted in Sam Tanenhaus, Whittaker Chambers: A Biography, (Random House, New York, 1997), p. 500. . Scholar Scott Scheall called economist Terence Hutchison \\"the most persistent critic of Mises's apriorism\\", starting in Hutchison's 1938 book The Significance and Basic Postulates of Economic Theory and in later publications such as his 1981 book The Politics and Philosophy of Economics: Marxians, Keynesians, and Austrians. Scheall noted that Friedrich Hayek, later in his life (after Mises died), also expressed reservations about Mises's apriorism, such as in a 1978 interview where Hayek said that he \\"never could accept the ... almost eighteenth-century rationalism in his [Mises's] argument\\". In a 1978 interview, Hayek said about Mises's book Socialism: Economist Milton Friedman considered Mises inflexible in his thinking: Economist Murray Rothbard, who studied under Mises, agreed he was uncompromising, but disputes reports of his abrasiveness. In his words, Mises was \\"unbelievably sweet, constantly finding research projects for students to do, unfailingly courteous, and never bitter\\" about the discrimination he received at the hands of the economic establishment of his time.Murray Rothbard, , 1990 talk at Mises University at Stanford, at MisesMedia Youtube channel. After Mises died, his widow Margit quoted a passage that he had written about Benjamin Anderson. She said it best described Mises's own personality: > His most eminent qualities were his inflexible honesty, his unhesitating > sincerity. He never yielded. He always freely enunciated what he considered > to be true. If he had been prepared to suppress or only to soften his > criticisms of popular, but irresponsible, policies, the most influential > positions and offices would have been offered him. But he never compromised. = Debates about fascism = Marxists Herbert Marcuse and Perry Anderson as well as German writer Claus-Dieter Krohn criticized Mises for writing approvingly of Italian fascism, especially for its suppression of leftist elements in Mises's 1927 book Liberalism.Ralph Raico, \\"Mises on Fascism, Democracy, and Other Questions, Journal of Libertarian Studies (1996) 12:1 pp. 1‚Äì27 In 2009, economist J. Bradford DeLong and sociologist Richard Seymour repeated the criticism.Richard Seymour, [The Meaning of Cameron], (Zero Books, John Hunt, London, 2010), p. 32, Mises wrote in the 1927 book:Ludwig von Mises, \\"Liberalism\\", Chapter 10, The Argument of Fascism, 1927. Mises biographer J√∂rg Guido H√ºlsmann says that critics who suggest that Mises supported fascism are \\"absurd\\" as he notes that the full quote describes fascism as dangerous. He notes that Mises thought it was a \\"fatal error\\" to think that it was more than an \\"emergency makeshift\\" against the looming threat of communism and socialism as exemplified by the Bolsheviks in Russia.

Trial Gustafsson was a bus driver and lived a normal life until 2004, almost 44 years after the event, when he was arrested by the police on the suspicion that he was the murderer. In early 2005, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation declared the case reopened, based on some new analysis of bloodstains found at the scene. These analyses required DNA testing, a technique not available at the time of the murders. According to police theory, Gustafsson had an alleged outburst of jealousy involving one of the victims, Irmeli Bj√∂rklund, his girlfriend. Irmeli was stabbed fifteen times that night, while the two other teenagers were killed less savagely. Gustafsson's own injuries were also severe. The trial started on 4 August 2005. The prosecution called for a life sentence against Gustafsson on three counts of murder. They claimed that the re-examination of the old evidence using modern techniques pointed directly to him. The defense argued that the killings were the work of one or more outsiders and that Gustafsson suffered injuries similar to those sustained by the other victims, and therefore would have been incapable of killing three people. Gustafsson had allegedly admitted to a police officer, following his arrest, that he had committed the murders, saying: \\"What's done is done, I'll get 15 years.\\" However, the court dismissed this and charges of false perjury were raised.

The school, which was founded in 1893, is set on 300 acres and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. History Main Hall On March 31, 1836, the Pennsylvania General Assembly granted a charter to Marshall College to be located in Mercersburg. Dr. Frederick Augustus Rauch came from Switzerland to be the first president of the college under the sponsorship of the Reformed Church in the United States. Dr. Rauch served as president from 1836 until 1841. His successor in the position was John Williamson Nevin who served until 1853, when Marshall College joined with Franklin College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to become Franklin & Marshall College. At this time, the preparatory department of Marshall College became known as Marshall Academy which later changed to Marshall Collegiate Institute. In 1865, the name was again changed to Mercersburg College, under whose charter the school continues to operate. The historic tie to the church continues through Mercersburg's membership in the Council for Higher Education of the United Church of Christ. On April 27, 1893, the Board of Regents elected Dr. William Mann Irvine, who had joined Franklin & Marshall College as an instructor after receiving his Ph.D. in political science from Princeton University in 1892 (and eventually an LL.D.), to become the headmaster at the age of 28. In July, Dr. Irvine changed the name of the institution to Mercersburg Academy and began his work as the founder of the present-day preparatory school. In the fall of 1893, he opened the school with an enrollment of 40 boys, four instructors and of ground. During Dr. Irvine's tenure, three dormitories, a dining hall, gymnasium, infirmary, administration building and the Chapel were built. A new Main Hall and Annex were built after a fire gutted Old Main in 1927. After Dr. Irvine's death on June 11, 1928, Dr. Boyd Edwards was elected headmaster, where he remained until he retired in 1941. After his retirement, Dr. Charles S. Tippetts '12 resigned from a deanship at the University of Pittsburgh to become headmaster, where he remained for 20 years. During this time, Irvine Hall was completed and the James Buchanan Cabin was moved onto the campus. His successor was William C. Fowle, who came from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. Fowle's tenure saw Tippetts Hall completed, Boone Hall constructed and Ford Hall constructed. In 1969, Mercersburg again became a coeducational school. In 1972, Walter H. Burgin Jr. '53 was appointed the school's fifth headmaster. Burgin had been a member and the chairman of Mercersburg's mathematics department from 1959 to 1964 and was teaching at Phillips Exeter Academy at the time of his appointment. Burgin oversaw a comprehensive reshaping of the Academy's academic facilities, the building of Lenfest Hall, and the integration of technology into community and classroom life. Douglas Hale was appointed head of school in 1997, coming from Baylor School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he had been a teacher, assistant headmaster, and eventually headmaster since 1973. During Hale's tenure, Mercersburg's endowment grew from $64 million in 1997 to $251 million in June 2015; all dormitories were renovated with new faculty apartments; the Smoyer Tennis Center and the Davenport Squash Center were constructed; the Prentiss- Zimmerman Quad was completely renovated in 2009; Nolde Gymnasium, the second oldest building on campus (1912), received a complete renovation in 2010‚Äîthe same year that Regents' Field, the school's first synthetic-turf athletic field, was completed; the Burgin Center for the Arts was dedicated in 2006; and in 2013 the Simon Student Center was opened after a total renovation and enlargement. Hale was succeeded in 2016 by Katherine Titus, who is the first female head of school in the Academy's history. Mercersburg Academy names first woman as head of school, accessed December 2, 2015 Before coming to Mercersburg, Titus spent 11 years at St. George's School in Rhode Island, most recently as associate head for school life. She had previously worked as dean of students and assistant head for student life at St. George's, and before that, was director of college counseling at Pingree School in Massachusetts. Titus is a graduate of Middlebury College and Columbia University. The school now offers 170 courses and has 106 faculty members (including 77 with master's degrees and four with doctorates). Mercersburg Academy today Now set on , Mercersburg serves grades 9‚Äì12 and postgraduate. As of the 2019‚Äì2020 school year, 442 students are enrolled: 51 percent boys and 49 percent girls. 84 percent of the students are boarding students, while 16 percent are day students. The school has a 33 percent acceptance rate. =Student body= Students come from around the world, representing 36 nations and 27 American states and the District of Columbia. International students account for 20 percent of the student body, and 25 percent of domestic students are persons of color. =Tuition and financial aid= Base tuition for the 2019‚Äì2020 school year is $60,680 for boarding students and $35,960 for day students. 50 percent of Academy students receive financial aid (need- and merit-based).

It was rebuilt that year and opened in 1928. Main Hall was an original building on campus and has been used as a dormitory and classroom space. It was renovated in 1998 and today it is exclusively a boys' dormitory. * Traylor Hall, completed in 1922, is home to the Head of School's Office, the Office of Admission and Financial Aid, the Business Office, and the Office of Summer Programs. * The Irvine Memorial Chapel was built in 1926 under the supervision and planning of Dr. William Mann Irvine by architect Ralph Adams Cram. The Chapel was designed in Gothic style and houses a large pipe organ and a traditional carillon in its tower. * Lenfest Hall is named for alumnus H. F. \\"Gerry\\" Lenfest '49 (a former president of Mercersburg's Board of Regents). Its contemporary design was intended to mirror the Irvine Memorial Chapel, which sits on the opposite side of the school's Prentiss-Zimmerman Quadrangle. Dedicated in 1993, Lenfest Hall houses the school's library (which has 50,000 volumes and various digital assets and capabilities); classrooms and offices for the history department; and the school archives. * Irvine Hall is a four-story classroom building; it was originally dedicated in 1949 and completely renovated in 1993. The building houses the office of the Academic Dean; classrooms and offices for the mathematics, science, and classical and modern languages departments; and the headquarters for the Office of Informational Technology, as well as the Sheridan Gallery, which houses works that are part of the school's permanent collection and is also used as a classroom. * Nolde Gymnasium was built in 1912; it has seen numerous expansions over the years and received a complete renovation in 2010. It is part of the Goldthorpe Athletic Complex, which also contains the Plantz Courts (1968), the Wrestling Center (1998), the McDowell Fitness Center (1998), the Davenport Squash Center (2004), the Hale Field House (2017), and the Lloyd Aquatic Center with the 50-meter Furnary Pool (2019). The Smoyer Tennis Center (2001) and the synthetic-turf Regents' Field (2009), as well as numerous other playing fields, are part of the total athletic center but set apart from Goldthorpe. * Rutledge Hall includes classrooms and offices for the English department and is connected to Keil Hall, a historic dormitory that houses the Edwards Room‚Äîwhich has at various times in the school's history served as a library, dining room, performance space, and student lounge. It includes 36 Tiffany windows adorned with some of the names of colleges and universities attended by Mercersburg students at the time of its dedication in 1900. * The Burgin Center for the Arts opened in 2006 and houses all aspects of the school's performing and visual arts curriculum. It stands on the former site of Boone Hall (the school's previous auditorium). The entire building is 65,500 square feet (6,090 m2) and includes theatres, dance studios, gallery spaces, visual-art labs and studios, a scene shop, classroom space, and offices for the fine arts department. * Ford Hall was built in 1965 and is the school's dining hall, where the Academy maintains its tradition of serving meals family-style. The hall is named in honor of Edward E. Ford '12, namesake of the E.E. Ford Foundation, which provided funds for the building. The Jimmy Walker and Jane Ford lounges on the upper level of the building‚Äîas well as the hall's main entrance‚Äîwere completely renovated in 2013. * The Simon Student Center, located on the lower level of Ford Hall, opened in 2013 after a total renovation and enlargement. It includes a large, circular student lounge with a small thrust stage for live performances; a cafe; a theatre-style HDTV room and game tables; an expanded school store and post office; meeting space for student clubs and organizations; and a handful of administrative offices. * The Masinter Outdoor Education Center was built in 2004 through a contribution from Edgar Masinter '48, a former president of Mercersburg's Board of Regents. It houses a 30-foot climbing wall for Mercersburg Outdoor Education (MOE) and Mercersburg Summer and Extended Programs and was created by a 10,000-square-foot timber-frame barn. * What is now the Prentiss Alumni and Parent Center at North Cottage once housed Mercersburg's head of school and family. While the head of school's family now resides across the street in 1893 House (opened in 2013), North Cottage includes guest rooms and a welcome center for alumni and visitors, and a 2016 addition created workspace for Mercersburg's Office of Advancement and Alumni Relations and Office of Strategic Marketing and Communications. * The Class of 1938 Observatory was given to the school as the 60th reunion gift of class members and has been in use since 2003. * The McFadden Model Railroad Museum is a collection of model trains resulting from the merging of two major collections and other minor donations. The John B. McFadden collection includes many items manufactured by the Lionel Train Company, dating from the pre-Depression years to the 1970s. The collection was given a home at the Academy in 1973 and includes at least 80 engines, as many as 200 pieces of rolling stock, and more than 200 feet of operating track. * The James Buchanan Cabin (believed to be the birthplace of the only Pennsylvanian to be elected president of the United States)Presidents' Places: James Buchanan was originally located at Stony Batter, an early trading post about 2.5 miles west of campus, and was erected sometime prior to 1791. It was moved to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where it served a variety of uses. To ensure that the cabin would be properly stored and maintained, the school purchased it in 1953 and placed it near Nolde Gymnasium on campus. =Boys' dormitories= * Keil Hall ‚Äì located above the historic Edwards Room and Rutledge Hall (which is home to the English Department). * Main Hall ‚Äì the original dorm and first building constructed as part of the school. * Tippetts Hall ‚Äì has three floors with one wing reserved for ninth graders; home to all ninth-grade boarding boys along with some 10th, 11th, and 12th graders. =Girls' dormitories= * Fowle Hall ‚Äì home to all ninth- and 10th-grade boarding girls, as well as some 11th- and 12th-grade girls. * South Cottage ‚Äì one of the oldest buildings on campus; used as a hospital for wounded soldiers during the Civil War. Part of its roof was blown off during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Offered to 11th- and 12-grade boarding girls. * Swank Hall ‚Äì formerly a boys' dorm known as the Main Annex. Offered to 11th- and 12-grade boarding girls. * Culbertson House ‚Äì a freestanding home on campus that houses 10 students and a separate faculty family apartment. It was changed from a boys‚Äô dorm to a girls‚Äô dorm in 2018. Offered to 10th, 11th- and 12-grade boarding students. All dormitories were completely renovated in the 1990s and early 2000s and are air-conditioned and fully wired with wireless and Ethernet connections; each dorm is also home to a number of faculty members and their families. Athletics Mercersburg baseball player, poster by Bristow Adams, 1903 Since 2000, Mercersburg has been a member of the Mid-Atlantic Prep League (MAPL), which includes Blair Academy, The Hill School, The Hun School of Princeton, Lawrenceville School and Peddie School. Mercersburg has produced 54 Olympians in its history. Mercersburg's vaunted swimming teams most recently won the Eastern Interscholastic Swimming & Diving Championships in 2016 (girls) and 2010 (boys). The baseball team has captured several PAISAA state championships (most recently in 2008) and won or shared the MAPL title every year from 2011 to 2018; the girls' basketball team won the 2016 state championship and the softball team earned the state title in 2012. Some of the Division I colleges where Mercersburg graduates compete in varsity athletics have included Air Force, Army, Bucknell, Boston University, College of Charleston, Cornell, Duke, Florida State, Georgetown, Harvard, Lehigh, Miami (Fla.), Navy, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Penn, Penn State, Southern California, Syracuse, Texas, Texas A&M;, Vanderbilt, Virginia, West Virginia, and Yale. Alumni have competed for professional teams including the Detroit Tigers and Baltimore Orioles (MLB), Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers (NFL), and Harlem Globetrotters.

The 65,500-square-foot facility is named for alumnus and former headmaster Walter Burgin '53 and his wife, Barbara. Designed by Polshek Partnership, the Burgin Center hosts concerts, theatre productions, guest speakers, and all-school meetings. Violinist Itzhak Perlman performed at the building's opening gala.Mercersburg Magazine Spring 2007, page 24 The Burgin Center houses: * A 600-seat proscenium stage (Simon Theatre) * A 120-seat studio ‚Äúblack box‚Äù theatre (Hale Studio Theatre) * Two gallery spaces * Two recital/rehearsal halls * Two dance studios * A digital art lab * A digital music lab * Four art studios, including a drawing studio, a painting studio, a sculpture studio and a ceramics studio * A scene shop * An acting studio and a general arts classroom * Several practice rooms and faculty offices =Stony Batter Players (Theatre)= Mercersburg embraced the performing arts as early as 1899 with the formation of Stony Batter, the school's first drama group. Stony Batter was created by Camille Irvine, the wife of founding headmaster William Mann Irvine.One Hundred Years of Life, David Emory, p. 90 The name ‚ÄúStony Batter‚Äù was adopted in honor of the place near campus where U.S. President James Buchanan was born. Today the group is known as Stony Batter Players. Recent productions have included Fiddler on the Roof, Proof, The Real Inspector Hound, Chicago, The Diary of Anne Frank, Antigone: An Apocalypse, Legally Blonde: The Musical, Urinetown, Mere Mortals, The Caucasian Chalk Circle, World War Z, and Lend Me A Tenor, among others. In the spring, Stony Batter typically performs scenes from the classical or Shakespearean repertoire or a modern ‚Äú10-Minute Play Festival.‚Äù Hollywood legend and Oscar- winner Jimmy Stewart '28 performed in Stony Batter productions while a student at Mercersburg. =Music= Music played an integral role at Mercersburg practically from the beginning. Dr. Irvine led the Mercersburg Academy Glee Club for a number of years, and in 1901 he published The Mercersburg Academy Song Book.One Hundred Years of Life, David Emory, p. 94 The Octet, the boys' a cappella group organized in 1947, performs at least three times each year. The Glee Club preceded the Octet and was the school's premier musical group for decades until it disbanded in 1976‚Äîa reflection of Mercersburg's then new coed status‚Äîafter which emerged the Mercersburg Chorale, a mixed chorus for boys and girls, and Magalia, the girls' a cappella group. Both ensembles are very active today. The Chapel Choir has existed since the building of the Irvine Memorial Chapel in 1926. Today the choirs perform at major school events, such as Convocation and Baccalaureate, in addition to occasional services in the Chapel and elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic region. Students with an interest in instrumental music have the opportunity to perform in the Mercersburg Jazz Band, Concert Band, or the String Ensemble. The school offers private music lessons through teachers from the Cumberland Valley School of Music or private studios for an additional fee. =Dance= Prior to 2003, the school showcased official dance recitals, musical-theatre performances, and a dance troupe called Storm Front that performed during halftime of home football games‚Äîbut all of these activities were extracurricular. In 2003, dance formally entered the Mercersburg curriculum, and the program came into its own in 2006 with the opening of the Burgin Center for the Arts and its two large, dedicated dance studios (the first in the school's history). The crux of the dance program today focuses on dance technique at various levels, including ballet, modern, jazz, tap, yoga, and strength training. The curriculum also includes three levels of dance composition. Two formal concerts are presented each year, in the fall and spring. =Visual Arts= Mercersburg's studio arts curriculum includes media ranging from ceramics to digital video art, sculpture, painting, and drawing. Student artwork is displayed in the Burgin Center for the Arts and across the campus. In the past two years, 11 students have captured awards in the annual Mid-Atlantic Prep League Art Exhibition, and five students had their work exhibited at the National K12 Ceramic Exhibition (considered to be the foremost juried ceramic competition for students in the U.S.). =The Carillon and Organ= Irvine Memorial Chapel The Swoope Carillon in Barker Tower of the Irvine Memorial Chapel is one of 163 traditional carillons in the United States. A gift of Mr. Henry B. Swoope, the original 43 bronze bells were cast in 1926 by the English firm of Gillett and Johnston of Croydon. The bells contain bits of historic metal collected worldwide by alumni and friends of the school, including copper coins, metal from Old Ironsides, pieces of artillery shells gathered from the fields of France in World War I, a shaving from the Liberty Bell, and bits from Admiral Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar, HMS Victory. The tower is named for Bryan Barker, who was the school's carillonneur for more than 50 years. Six additional upper bells were added in 1996 and the 50th bell‚Äîa low C#‚Äîwas added in 2008 and dedicated to Barker's successor as carillonneur, James W. Smith. With the whole school assembled to watch, the 50th bell was lifted into place in May 2008, and it was first played by Smith a few days later after the mechanics had been put in place. Smith served as carillonneur from 1981 until he died in 2009. The Chapel organ was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. George A. Wood. Built by the Skinner Organ Company of Boston in 1925, the organ has 55 stops, about 4,000 pipes, 27 couplers, and 33 adjustable combination pistons. School traditions The Washington Irving Literary Society and John Marshall Literary Society‚Äîthe school's oldest student organizations‚Äîtrace their roots back before Mercersburg Academy was even established. Before Marshall College moved to Lancaster to become Franklin & Marshall College, its students created the Diagnothian and Goethean literary societies. In 1865, after the founding of Mercersburg College, the Washington Irving Literary Society was born; within a year, the rival John Marshall Literary Society emerged.[One Hundred Years of Life, David Emory, p. 84] William Mann Irvine helped revive the two societies at the Academy's founding, and the rival societies have competed against one another ever since. All students attending Mercersburg are members of one of the two societies; those with family members who preceded them at the school can choose to represent the same society. Otherwise, society officers meet early in the school year to select new students for each group. (This replaces the early practice of returning students racing to meet stagecoaches carrying new students to campus, in hopes of convincing those students to join a particular society.) What began as a midwinter debate competition has evolved into a week of intense competition in everything from basketball and swimming to chess and poker. The climactic event of the week is Declamation, a speaking contest where five representatives from each society deliver prepared monologues. Winners of each event during the week earn points for their respective societies, with the largest number of points awarded at Declamation. The winning society claims bragging rights for the next 12 months. Each year, on the Friday evening of Alumni Weekend (often held in October), students gather on the steps of Main Hall for Step Songs, which involves the singing of school songs and traditional cheers as a pep rally for the next day's athletic contests, usually against a Mid-Atlantic Prep League opponent. The tradition evolved into its present form from that of an annual concert given for visiting alumni by the Glee Club‚Äîunder the direction of Headmaster Irvine. (Irvine suffered a stroke during Step Songs in 1928 and died a week later.)Mercersburg Magazine Summer 2013, inside front cover In a tradition known as \\"Painting the Numbers,\\" the school seniors gather late one night each fall to paint the school's Academy Drive entrance with their class year. The paint often stays visible until the following fall. Mercersburg holds its commencement exercises outdoors on a raised graduation platform of grass and stone between South Cottage and Keil Hall. It is tradition for students to avoid setting foot on the platform their entire academic careers prior to commencement day. Graduates do not wear traditional caps and gowns to the ceremony; instead, girls wear white dresses and boys wear coats and ties. The class valedictorian receives his/her diploma first, while two class marshals (elected by members of the class) and the senior-class president are the final students to be announced as graduates. A baccalaureate ceremony is held in the Irvine Memorial Chapel the evening before commencement. =Notable alumni= Mercersburg has produced many outstanding individuals, including 54 Olympians (who have won 12 gold medals), seven Rhodes Scholars, several Fulbright Scholars, a Nobel Prize winner, two Academy Award winners, and two Emmy Award winners.

In 1981, E. W. Kelley & Associates, a group led by E. W. Kelley, bought controlling interest in Steak 'n Shake, and grew the company from a small chain to the more than 450 location chain it is today (2006). Originally from Sharpsville, Indiana, Kelley attended Indiana University's (IU) School of Business in the 1930s. While at IU, he founded the Accounting Club, chaired IU Sing, was president of the IU student body, and was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. He graduated in 1939. Kelley ran Bird's Eye, a division of General Foods, and thought up adding pearl onions to frozen peas. He later headed Fairmont Foods, where he helped develop the Klondike Bar, directed the roll-outs of Tang and Cool Whip, created parts of the Lean Cuisine line, and brought Grey Poupon to America. He was founding partner of Kelley & Partners, Ltd. and taught at the Columbia Business School. Kelley was always philanthropic, giving millions of dollars to IU and Howard Community Hospital, now known as Community Howard Regional Health, in Kokomo, Indiana. He donated to Indiana University-Kokomo, (IUK), for the Kelley Student Center, Kelley House, the library building and the E. W. Kelley Scholarship fund. He gave money in 1999 to establish the E. W. Kelley Chair in Business Administration at IU Bloomington, and $23 million to establish the IU Bloomington's Business School's Kelley Scholars program in 1997, which led IU to rename the School of Business to the Kelley School of Business. He also supported the Bloomington campus' Alumni center, School of Music, the Mellencamp Pavilion, and the Alva Prickett Chair in Accounting. E. W. Kelley maintained a home in Sharpsville until his death, and also a home in Florida. He had turned the old family farm, located on U.S. Route 31 about 6 miles south of Kokomo, Indiana, into the Kelley Historical Agricultural Museum. Other family interests include Kelley Farms, which has since merged with Adler Seeds of Sharpsville, just across the road from the E. W. Kelley home. Kelley Farms was run by E. W.'s brother Bill Kelley, who also owned Shady Kennels and the former Red Carpet Motel outside of Sharpsville. Adler Seeds was founded by neighbor and friend Howard Adler. E. W.

Van Meekeren was a pupil of Nicolaas Tulp and became a surgeon in Amsterdam in 1635. He was respected by outstanding contemporary medical doctors for his knowledge of medical literature and his skills, who made a definite link between anatomy and surgery. He showed a great interest in hand surgery, and interesting is a demonstration of flexor tendon repairs on corpses by one of his pupils. He wrote a book, which gives a good representation of the state of the art of surgery in the seventeenth century in Amsterdam. Names and addresses of patients are fully mentioned, so even today we know exactly where they lived and where the events took place. On the other hand, we also know quite well what the surgeons and doctors looked like through the efforts of many excellent painters who depicted anatomy lessons. In Amsterdam, barber- surgeons' guilds were very eager to sit for group paintings, centered on the teaching medical doctor. The painter Aert Pietersz in 1603 painted Dr. Sebastiaan Egberts surrounded by 29 surgeons, and in 1619, Dr. Egberts was painted once more, this time with five learning surgeons, by Thomas de Keyser. Nicolaes Eliasz, named Pickenoy, painted Dr. Johan Fonteyn in 1625, and Rembrandt is well known for the Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp (1632) and Dr. Deyman (1656).

The process took a lot of time, and since the last integrated course class graduated in September 2006, the college did not take in any new students per April 2007. Snorre Runeson Bendiktsen was not happy with this, since he was the entrepreneur of the college. On May 20, 2008 the University of Troms√∏ announced that their flight training programme would be commencing during autumn 2008, with actual flight training starting spring 2009 in Troms√∏. It is still unclear as to what part Norwegian Aviation College would have played in the new establishment, as the company formally ceased to exist at the end of 2007, and their aircraft and other assets sold.  History  Norwegian Aviation College was started in 1992 by Scandinavian Airlines System and SAS Flight Academy.  Fleet  2 Piper Seneca V 4 Piper Archer III 4 Grob 115D NAC operated a fleet of civilian trainers, with the twin engine training being completed on the Piper Seneca V. In 1999, NAC completely renewed its fleet by replacing the Cessna and MFI-15 with 6 Piper Archer III's, 4 Grob 115D's and 2 Piper Seneca V. Later they reduced their fleet by two Piper Archer III.  Location  Bardufoss is located in the beautiful nature of M√•lselv municipality, in the inner part of Troms. The municipality is characterized by wide valleys that cut in between tall mountains. At the floor of the majestic M√•lselv valley, runs the 140 km long M√•lselv, a river renowned for its salmon and trout fishing. The M√•lselv waterfall between Andselv and √òverbygd is 600 meters long with a 15-meter drop. Along the waterfall, a 450 meter long salmon bridge is blasted out of the rock. In eastern M√•lselv, √òvre Dividalen national park is located, known for its ancient pine forest. The area has several large military camps, and Bardufoss is an important air base of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, being the home of two helicopter squadrons. Different NATO allies perform their winter training here, and during January to March there is high activity at the airport and in the airspace around Bardufoss.

The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006 ruled the Kingdom of Kongo from 23 January 1641 to 1661. He is sometimes considered Kongo's greatest king for his religious piety and his near expulsion of the Portuguese from Angola. Early life Garcia and his brother √Ålvaro Nimi were born in the early 17th century. Both brothers attended the Jesuit college at S√£o Salvador (modern M'banza-Kongo) soon after it was opened in 1620, where they studied with the Jesuit priest Jo√£o de Paiva. As students, they joined the lay brotherhood of St. Ignatius. During his youth, Garcia obtained the nickname \\"Kipaku\\" (\\"Quipaco\\") of uncertain meaning. In 1634, when King √Ålvaro V was threatened by Daniel da Silva, Duke of Mbamba, the brothers came to the king's aid. Garcia was particularly valiant during the desperate battle in the County of Soyo, when the royal army was backed up against the river. The brothers were awarded for their bravery: Garcia was named Marquis of Kiova, a small territory on the south bank of the Congo River, while his brother was promoted to Duke of Mbamba. However, in 1636 √Ålvaro V sought to remove and execute the brothers, and in defense they defeated and beheaded the king. √Ålvaro was then crowned King √Ålvaro VI and named Garcia as Duke of Mbamba. Taking the Throne and the Dutch War On 22 January 1641, √Ålvaro died under mysterious circumstances. Before an election to replace his brother could be held, Garcia moved forces from Mbamba to the capital and forcibly became king. Within a few weeks, Paulo, the Count of Soyo and longtime ally, died and was replaced by his and Garcia's enemy Daniel da Silva. Concurrently, the Dutch armada invaded and took the Portuguese colony of Luanda. Garcia immediately moved his armies south to assist the Dutch, as Kongo had a long-term pact to help the Dutch drive the Portuguese out of Angola. In 1642, he received an embassy from the Dutch and signed an alliance and agreement, but refused to accept a Calvinist preacher from them due to his Catholic background. Garcia hoped that the Dutch would assist him in driving the Portuguese out of Angola, as these terms had been laid down as early as 1622, when Pedro II of Kongo had proposed the Kongo-Dutch alliance. However, the Dutch were not as willing to press their attack home once they had taken Luanda. Instead, they hoped to make it a trading post and allowed the Portuguese to continue to possess their inland territories. Dutch soldiers, however, helped Garcia defeat a rebellion in the small southern district of Nsala in 1642, the slaves captured from this paying for Dutch expenses in taking Luanda. In 1643, as the relations between the Dutch West India Company and the Portuguese broke down, Garcia's forces assisted in driving the Portuguese from their positions on the Bengo River. However, the Dutch again refused to press home the attack, allowing the Portuguese to regroup further inland at Massangano. Garcia could not commit more forces to the campaign against Portugal due to increasing hostility with Daniel da Silva. Thus, in 1645, he sought to drive Daniel from Soyo, but was defeated trying to take the Soyo fortified position at Mfinda Ngula. His son and would-be heir, Afonso, was captured while leading the Kongo forces, and a campaign to free him in 1646 failed. Because of these wars, Kongo could only send small forces when the Dutch declared war in alliance with Queen Njinga of Matamba on the Portuguese in fear of the reinforced Portuguese driving them out of Luanda. Although the allies were successful at the Battle of Kombi in 1647, they were unable to dislodge the Portuguese from their forts. Further reinforcements from Brazil in 1648 forced the Dutch to withdraw. Following the Portuguese Restoration In the years following the Dutch war, Garcia sought to make amends with the Portuguese and settle relations. Salvador Correia de S√°, the Portuguese governor, drafted a treaty demanding from Garcia the Island of Luanda, all lands south of the Bengo River, the rights to all mines in Kongo, payment of an indemnity, and other major concessions. Garcia proposed a different treaty that insisted on restoration of his rights to the south of the Bengo River as well as other demands. The treaty was presented in 1649 and, while Garcia did pay an indemnity, neither side signed the treaty. Garcia turned his attention to internal affairs following the Dutch period. Capuchin missionaries, who arrived from Italy and Spain, helped provide more clergy for the Church in 1645. Although Garcia initially welcomed the clergymen, he became suspicious and accused them of plotting against Kongo in 1652. In the same year he imprisoned Do√±a Leonor, an elderly and well respected queen, for her involvement in an alleged plot. Leonor died in prison, which caused Garcia to lose considerable public confidence. In 1655 Garcia again attempted to take Soyo. Two sons of Pedro II, as members of the House of Nsundi (or the Kinkanga a Mvika), tried to overthrow him the next year. The Portuguese intervened on their behalf and also tried to attack Kongo. However, Garcia defeated the brothers and prevented the Portuguese, who remembered their crushing defeat following the Battle of Mbumbi in 1622, from crossing the Loje River. By 1657, Garcia II had annihilated or absorbed all of the House of Nsundi. Garcia died in 1660, leaving his second son Ant√≥nio I of Kongo to succeed him.

Plotted lines are: y = 10x (red), y = x (green), y = log(x) (blue). In science and engineering, a semi-log plot, or semi-log graph (or semi- logarithmic plot/graph), has one axis on a logarithmic scale, the other on a linear scale. It is useful for data with exponential relationships, where one variable covers a large range of valuesM. Bourne Graphs on Logarithmic and Semi-Logarithmic Paper (www.intmath.com), or to zoom in and visualize that - what seems to be a straight line in the beginning - is in fact the slow start of a logarithmic curve that is about to spike and changes are much bigger than thought initially.. All equations of the form y=\\\\lambda a^{\\\\gamma x} form straight lines when plotted semi-logarithmically, since taking logs of both sides gives :\\\\log_a y = \\\\gamma x + \\\\log_a \\\\lambda. This is a line with slope \\\\gamma and \\\\log_a \\\\lambda vertical intercept. The logarithmic scale is usually labeled in base 10; occasionally in base 2: :\\\\log (y) = (\\\\gamma \\\\log (a)) x + \\\\log (\\\\lambda). A log-linear (sometimes log-lin) plot has the logarithmic scale on the y-axis, and a linear scale on the x-axis; a linear-log (sometimes lin-log) is the opposite. The naming is output-input (y-x), the opposite order from (x, y). On a semi-log plot the spacing of the scale on the y-axis (or x-axis) is proportional to the logarithm of the number, not the number itself. It is equivalent to converting the y values (or x values) to their log, and plotting the data on linear scales. A log-log plot uses the logarithmic scale for both axes, and hence is not a semi-log plot. Equations The equation of a line on a linear-log plot, where the abscissa axis is scaled logarithmically (with a logarithmic base of n), would be : F(x) = m \\\\log_{n}(x) + b. \\\\, The equation for a line on a log-linear plot, with an ordinate axis logarithmically scaled (with a logarithmic base of n), would be: : \\\\log_{n}(F(x)) = mx + b : F(x) = n^{mx + b} = (n^{mx})(n^b). =Finding the function from the semi‚Äìlog plot=  Linear-log plot  On a linear-log plot, pick some fixed point (x0, F0), where F0 is shorthand for F(x0), somewhere on the straight line in the above graph, and further some other arbitrary point (x1, F1) on the same graph. The slope formula of the plot is: : m = \\\\frac {F_1 - F_0}{\\\\log_n (x_1 / x_0)} which leads to : F_1 - F_0 = m \\\\log_n (x_1 / x_0) or : F_1 = m \\\\log_n (x_1 / x_0) + F_0 = m \\\\log_n (x_1) - m \\\\log_n (x_0) + F_0 which means that :F(x) = m \\\\log_n (x) + constant In other words, F is proportional to the logarithm of x times the slope of the straight line of its lin‚Äìlog graph, plus a constant. Specifically, a straight line on a lin‚Äìlog plot containing points (F0, x0) and (F1, x1) will have the function: : F(x) = (F_1 - F_0) {\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\log_n (x / x_0)}{\\\\log_n(x_1 / x_0)}\\\\right]} + F_0 = (F_1 - F_0) \\\\log_{\\\\frac{x_1}{x_0}}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{x_0}\\\\right)} + F_0  log-linear plot  On a log-linear plot (logarithmic scale on the y-axis), pick some fixed point (x0, F0), where F0 is shorthand for F(x0), somewhere on the straight line in the above graph, and further some other arbitrary point (x1, F1) on the same graph. The slope formula of the plot is: : m = \\\\frac {\\\\log_n (F_1 / F_0)}{x_1 - x_0} which leads to : \\\\log_n(F_1 / F_0) = m (x_1 - x_0) Notice that nlogn(F1) = F1. Therefore, the logs can be inverted to find: : \\\\frac{F_1}{F_0} = n^{m(x_1 - x_0)} or : F_1 = F_0n^{m(x_1 - x_0)} This can be generalized for any point, instead of just F1: : F(x) = {F_0} n^{\\\\left(\\\\frac {x-x_0}{x_1-x_0}\\\\right) \\\\log_n (F_1 / F_0)} Real-world examples =Phase diagram of water= In physics and chemistry, a plot of logarithm of pressure against temperature can be used to illustrate the various phases of a substance, as in the following for water: log-linear pressure‚Äìtemperature phase diagram of water.

Notice that while the horizontal (time) axis is linear, with the dates evenly spaced, the vertical (cases) axis is logarithmic, with the evenly spaced divisions being labelled with successive powers of two. The semi-log plot makes it easier to see when the infection has stopped spreading at its maximum rate ie. the straight line on this exponential plot, and starts to curve to indicate a slower rate. This might indicate that some form of mitigation action is working eg. social distancing. =Microbial growth= In biology and biological engineering, the change in numbers of microbes due to asexual reproduction and nutrient exhaustion is commonly illustrated by a semi-log plot. Time is usually the independent axis, with the logarithm of the number or mass of bacteria or other microbe as the dependent variable. This forms a plot with four distinct phases, as shown below.

He competed in the AMA Grand National Championship from 1962 to 1977. Lawwill is notable for winning the 1969 AMA Grand National Championship as a member of the Harley-Davidson factory racing team. After his motorcycle racing career, Lawwill became one of the top motorcycle racing frame designers and builders. Lawwill then used his experience as a motorcycle frame builder to become an innovative mountain bike designer, developing one of the first bicycle suspensions. He also developed prosthetic limbs for amputees. Lawwill was inducted in the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998. Motorcycle racing career Lawwill was born in Boise, Idaho. He started his racing career as an amateur racer on the local TT track in Boise and, later, scramble races (later known as motocross) across the United States Northwest. In 1961, he moved to Los Angeles, California so that he could race at the Ascot Park race track which, at the time was the epicenter of dirt track racing. He gained sponsorship from Dudley Perkins, a Harley-Davidson dealer in San Francisco. It was during this time that Lawwill began to learn about modifying motorcycle frames for racing competitions. By 1963, he had become a professional rider and in 1964 he signed a contract to compete for the Harley-Davidson factory racing team with whom he would remain for the rest of his racing career. Lawwill won his first AMA national race at the Sacramento Mile on September 19, 1965. In 1969, Lawwill won the AMA Grand National Championship and, was voted AMA's Most Popular Rider of the Year. His defense of his Grand National Championship during the 1970 season became the subject of Bruce Brown's 1971 motorcycle documentary film, On Any Sunday co-starring actor Steve McQueen and off-road racer Malcolm Smith. Lawwill continued to compete for the AMA Grand National Championship until 1977 when, he retired at the age of 37 due to an inner-ear disorder that affected his balance. He accumulated 161 career AMA Grand National finishes and won 15 Grand National races during his 15-year racing career. Design career In the late 1970s, Lawwill became involved in designing bicycle frames for the burgeoning sport of mountain biking. He was one of the early pioneers in the off-road bicycling world, having introduced the first production mountain bike. He also developed the first commercially produced four-bar linkage suspension for mountain bikes and patented the design. During this period, he continued his involvement in motorcycle racing as a race team owner in the AMA Grand National Championship until 1990 when, he grew frustrated with the way the AMA ran the championship. He then ran the Yeti Cycles racing team competing in downhill mountain bike racing and, developed the successful Lawwill DH-9 full-suspension downhill bike. Lawwill's custom racing bicycles became highly prized by top racers around the world and his designs won numerous national and world titles. Lawwill is currently involved in constructing and marketing street-legal versions of the Harley- Davidson XR-750 bike that he raced in the Grand National Championship. He also runs a non-profit company supplying prosthetic hands so that amputees can ride bicycles or motorcycles. Approximately a third of all the prosthetic hands that he manufactures go to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, for use by military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

Wavefront coding falls under the broad category of computational photography as a technique to enhance the depth of field. Encoding The wavefront of a light wave passing through the camera system is modulated using optical elements that introduce a spatially varying optical path length. The modulating elements must be placed at or near the plane of the aperture stop or pupil so that the same modulation is introduced for all field angles across the field-of-view. This modulation corresponds to a change in complex argument of the pupil function of such an imaging device, and it can be engineered with different goals in mind: e.g. extending the depth of focus. =Linear phase mask= Wavefront coding with linear phase masks works by creating an optical transfer function that encodes distance information.US Patent 7218448 - Extended depth of field optical systems =Cubic phase mask= Wavefront Coding with cubic phase masks works to blur the image uniformly using a cubic shaped waveplate so that the intermediate image, the optical transfer function, is out of focus by a constant amount. Digital image processing then removes the blur and introduces noise depending upon the physical characteristics of the processor. Dynamic range is sacrificed to extend the depth of field depending upon the type of filter used. It can also correct optical aberration.Extended depth of field through wave-front coding The mask was developed by using the ambiguity function and the stationary phase method History The technique was pioneered by radar engineer Edward Dowski and his thesis adviser Thomas Cathey at the University of Colorado in the United States in the 1990s.

He was drafted into the NHL by the San Jose Sharks in the sixth round, 175th overall, at the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. In 2018, he was named the head coach of the ECHL's Newfoundland Growlers, a position he resigned from in January 2019. Playing career =Professional= Having been drafted by the NHL's San Jose Sharks in the sixth round, 177th overall, of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, Clowe played two full seasons with the Cleveland Barons, San Jose's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, and was named team MVP in 2004‚Äì05, before splitting time between the Barons and the Sharks in 2005‚Äì06. Clowe appeared in 18 games with the Sharks in the 2005‚Äì06 season. In the subsequent off-season, he signed a new three-year contract worth $1.625 million; the contract was a two-way deal for two of its first three years. 200px Approximately halfway through the first season of the contract, in 2006‚Äì07, Clowe was given an opportunity to play on the Sharks' first line and power play unit alongside Patrick Marleau and Joe Thornton, where he responded with a career-high 34 points in 58 games. He scored his first career NHL hat-trick on January 6, 2007, in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. In the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, he scored his first playoff goal on April 13 in the Western Conference Quarterfinals series against the Nashville Predators. Securing his roster spot on the Sharks, he became known for his hard-checking game and willingness to fight when needed. Clowe played 11 games for the Sharks in 2007‚Äì08, then went on injured reserve on October 28, 2007, due to torn knee ligaments. He returned to the lineup on March 30, 2008, in time for the 2008 playoffs, during which he recorded 9 points in 13 games, which was second-best on the team behind only Joe Thornton. On July 6, 2009, Clowe signed a new four-year contract that paid him $3.5 million in each of his first three years and $4 million in his final year. On April 5, 2012, Clowe reached out from the bench with his stick to illegally interfere with Los Angeles Kings centreman Jarret Stoll. The Sharks went on to win the game 6‚Äì5 in a shootout. Although review deemed the move illegal, there was no supplemental discipline by the NHL. On November 6, 2012, during the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout, Clowe signed with the San Francisco Bulls of the ECHL. On February 22, 2013, during a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Clowe left the bench to start a fight with Blackhawks forward Andrew Shaw. Clowe was assessed a minor penalty for roughing and a game misconduct for leaving the bench on an illegal line change to start a fight. The Sharks lost the game 2‚Äì1. After supplemental review, Clowe was given a two-game suspension by the NHL. On April 2, 2013, Clowe, with his contract set to expire at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for a second- and a third-round pick in 2013, as well as a conditional second- round pick in 2014. (The conditional pick was to become a fifth-round pick should Clowe not resign with New York, or should New York fail to win two playoff rounds; both conditions were satisfied and the pick became a fifth- rounder.) On July 5, 2013, as an unrestricted free agent, Clowe signed a five- year, $24.25 million contract with the New Jersey Devils. On September 12, 2015, Clowe retired from the NHL after team doctors refused to clear him to return to the ice following a concussion initially sustained in a November 6, 2014, game against the St. Louis Blues. Coaching career On July 12, 2016, Clowe was named the assistant coach of his former team, the New Jersey Devils. After two seasons as an assistant, he was hired as a head coach by the Newfoundland Growlers, an expansion team in the ECHL, for the 2018‚Äì19 season. He stepped down as head coach in January 2019 due to continuing health issues related to his concussion history. He'd already missed several games in November due to health concerns.

They quickly gained enormous popularity, and are the most famous of the many Glasgow tearooms that opened in the late 19th and early 20th century. The building was fully restored largely to Mackintosh's original designs between 2014 and 2018. It was re- opened as working tea rooms in July 2018 and trades under the name \\"Mackintosh at The Willow\\". This follows a trademark dispute with the former operator of The Willow Tearooms which was resolved in 2017. This name is now used at tea room premises in Buchanan Street and was also additionally used at the Watt Brothers Department Store in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow between 2016 and its closure in 2019. The Tea Rooms at 217 Sauchiehall Street first opened in 1903 and are the only surviving Tea Rooms designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for local entrepreneur and patron Miss Catherine Cranston. Over the years and through various changes of ownership and use, the building had deteriorated until it was purchased in 2014 by The Willow Tea Rooms Trust in order to prevent the forced sale of the building, closure of the Tea Rooms and loss of its contents to collectors. Background Mackintosh's design for the frieze at the Buchanan Street tearoom. Early in his career, in 1896, Mackintosh met Catherine Cranston (widely known as Kate Cranston or simply Miss Cranston), an entrepreneurial local business woman who was the daughter of a Glasgow tea merchant and a strong believer in temperance. The temperance movement was becoming increasingly popular in Glasgow at the turn of the century and Miss Cranston had conceived the idea of a series of \\"art tearooms\\", venues where people could meet to relax and enjoy non-alcoholic refreshments in a variety of different \\"rooms\\" within the same building. This proved to be the start of a long working relationship between Miss Cranston and Mackintosh. Between 1896 and 1917 he designed and re-styled interiors in all four of her Glasgow tearooms, often in collaboration with his wife Margaret Macdonald. =The early tearooms= Mackintosh was engaged to design the wall murals of her new Buchanan Street tearooms in 1896. The tearooms had been designed and built by George Washington Browne of Edinburgh, with interiors and furnishings being designed by George Walton. Mackintosh designed stencilled friezes depicting opposing pairs of elongated female figures surrounded by roses for the ladies‚Äô tearoom, the luncheon room and the smokers‚Äô gallery. In 1898, his next commission for the existing Argyle Street tearooms saw the design roles reversed, with Mackintosh designing the furniture and interiors, and Walton designing the wall murals. This was to see the first appearance of Mackintosh's trademark high-backed chair design. In 1900 Miss Cranston commissioned him to redesign an entire room in her Ingram Street tearooms, which resulted in the creation of the White Dining Room. Patrons entering the dining room from Ingram Street had to pass through a hallway separated from the room by a wooden screen with leaded glass inserts, offering tantalising glimpses of the experience to come. This led to the commission to design completely the proposed new tearooms in Sauchiehall Street in 1903. For the first time, Mackintosh was given responsibility for not only the interior design and furniture, but also for the full detail of the internal layout and exterior architectural treatment. The resultant building came to be known as the Willow Tearooms, and is the best known and most important work that Mackintosh undertook for Miss Cranston. The Willow Tearooms The Room de Luxe in the Tearooms as it was in 1903. Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, around 1914 looking east. The Willow Tearoom is shown on the right The location selected by Miss Cranston for the new tearooms was a four-storey former warehouse building on a narrow infill urban site on the south side of Sauchiehall Street. The street and surrounding area are part of the New Town of Blythswood created largely by William Harley of Blythswood Square in the early 1800s. The name \\"Sauchiehall\\" is derived from \\"saugh\\", the Scots word for a willow tree, and \\"haugh\\", meadow. This provided the starting point for Mackintosh and MacDonald's ideas for the design theme. Within the existing structure, Mackintosh designed a range of spaces with different functions and decor for the Glasgow patrons to enjoy. There was a ladies‚Äô tearoom to the front of the ground floor, with a general lunch room to the back and a tea gallery above it. The first floor contained the \\"Room de Luxe\\", a more exclusive ladies' room overlooking Sauchiehall Street. The second floor contained a timber-panelled billiards room and smoking rooms for the men. The design concept foresaw a place for the ladies to meet their friends, and for the men to use on their breaks from office work - an oasis in the city centre. The decoration of the different rooms was themed: light for feminine, dark for masculine. The ladies' tea room at the front was white, silver, and rose; the general lunch room at the back was panelled in oak and grey canvas, and the top-lit tea gallery above was pink, white, and grey. In addition to designing the internal architectural alterations and a new external facade, in collaboration with his wife Margaret, Mackintosh designed almost every other aspect of the tearooms, including the interior design, furniture, cutlery, menus, and even the waitress uniforms. Willow was the basis for the name of the tearooms, but it also formed an integral part of the decorative motifs employed in the interior design, and much of the timberwork used in the building fabric and furniture. =The Room Deluxe= The Room de Luxe was the most extravagant of the rooms that Mackintosh created, and proved to be the tearooms' main attraction. The room was positioned on the first floor at the front of the building, slightly above the level of the tea gallery at the rear, and featured a vaulted ceiling with a full-width, slightly curved bay window looking out to Sauchiehall Street. Entrance to the room was by way of a magnificent set of double doors which featured leaded glass decoration, hinting at the colours and motifs to be found beyond. Margaret MacDonald's famous gesso panel O ye, all ye that walk in Willowood. Described at the time as \\"a fantasy for afternoon tea\\", the room was intimate and richly decorated. It featured a sumptuous colour scheme of grey, purple and white, featuring a soft grey carpet, a silk upholstered dado, chairs and settees upholstered in a rich rose-purple, and silver painted tables with high-backed chairs. The walls were painted a simple white, with a high level frieze of coloured, mirrored and leaded glass panels. One side wall contained the fireplace and, opposite, the other wall featured one of Margaret MacDonald's most famous works, the gesso panel inspired by Rossetti's sonnet O Ye, all ye that walk in Willow Wood. This was all complemented by crisp, white tablecloths and blue willow- pattern crockery. The luxurious decoration of the room can be understood as a logical extension of the Mackintoshes' stylistic development from 1900, where they would develop all-encompassing interior designs for domestic commissions, and then transfer these to their designs for commercial projects and exhibitions. Their colourful interior designs in the House for an Art Lover culminated in the Room de Luxe interior as a commercial vision of the European idea of the room as a work of art. =The external facade= The Willow Tearooms frontage on Sauchiehall Street, around 1903. Mackintosh's redesigned external facade was a carefully considered asymmetric, abstractly modelled composition with shallow curves on some areas of the surface, and varying depths of recesses to windows and the main entrance. The composition respected the urban context of the neighbouring buildings, matching the major cornice lines and heights of adjoining buildings, whilst still exploring emerging ideas of Art Nouveau and the modern movement. The ground floor entrance door is placed far to the left of a wide band of fenestration, both of which are recessed below the first-floor level, the location of the Room de Luxe. To emphasise the importance of this room, Mackintosh designed a full width bay window, projecting the facade outwards with a gentle curve. The two storeys above this featured a more regular pattern of fenestration with three individual windows per floor, recessed to different degrees. The asymmetry of the composition was continued by widening the left side windows and creating another gentle curve in this part of the facade, extending through both storeys. This repeated the curved form of the first floor and emphasised the heavily recessed entrance to the building below. Mackintosh chose to finish the facade in a white-painted smooth render, in contrast to the natural stone finish of nearby buildings. This decision, plus the use of small paned windows and ornamental tile inserts forming a chequered border around the perimeter of the facade, gave it an elegance and lightness of touch appropriate for its purpose. The domestic-style leaded glass announced the intimacy of the interior and hinted at the luxurious willow theme to be found inside. The Willow Tearooms today Following the death of her husband in 1917, Miss Cranston sold her businesses. The Willow Tearooms continued in use under a new name until they were incorporated into Daly's department store in 1928. By 1938 the others had passed into the hands of Cranston's Tearooms Ltd. When this company went into liquidation in 1954 the tearooms were sold and subsequently put to a number of different uses over the years. Though Daly's adapted the Willow Tearooms building as part of their department store, the fa√ßade was unchanged above their ground floor plate glass shop window and fascia, the moulded plaster frieze could still be seen above the ground floor shopfittings, and the Room de Luxe remained in use as the department store tea room until they closed around the start of the 1980s. Extensive restoration work was carried out under the architect Geoffrey Wimpenny of Keppie Henderson, successors of the Honeyman, Keppie and Mackintosh partnership of almost a century earlier. The Willow Tearooms reopened in 1983 with the restored ground floor fa√ßade forming the shop front to Henderson the jewellers which occupied the ground floor and the reconstructed gallery. At the same time the Room de Luxe was refurbished to recreate the original colour scheme, and furnished with reproductions of the high back chairs, though originally there were only eight of these chairs at formal central tables while chairs around the perimeter had lower backs. It was reopened in 1983 by Anne Mulhern, a Glasgow businesswoman, and in 1996 she also leased the tea gallery at the rear of the building. In 2014 the building was bought by Glasgow businesswoman, Celia Sinclair in order to prevent the forced sale of the building, closure of the Tea Rooms and loss of its contents to collectors as the landlord had gone into receivership. The building is now in the ownership of ‚ÄòThe Willow Tea Rooms Trust‚Äô, a registered charity. The aims and objectives of the Trust include the restoration and preservation of the Tea Rooms as part of Scotland‚Äôs heritage and for the benefit of the general public. The restoration of the building during 2014-2018 was budgeted at ¬£10 million and was funded through a mixture of private and grant money including almost ¬£4 million from The Heritage Lottery Fund,https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/media- centre/press-releases/national-lottery-support-restoration- mackintosh%E2%80%99s-willow-tea The Monument Trust, Historic Environment Scotland, Glasgow City Heritage Trust, Glasgow City Council, Dunard Fund and Architectural Heritage Fund. Following an international competition run by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, Simpson & Brown were appointed as Conservation Architects and lead Design Consultants. The restoration project is complemented by the creation of a retail outlet, education, conferencing and visitor centre in the adjoining 215 Sauchiehall Street premises. The restoration of no 217 included extensive re-creation of Mackintosh's interior schemes and decorative elements lost over the years. Large quantities of furniture to Mackintosh's designs have also been reproduced for use in the various parts of the Tea Room ( the originals being lost or in private and museum collections throughout the world ). One of the most celebrated spaces in the building, the Room de Luxe has been fully restored and includes a suite of specially commissioned furniture, re-created chandeliers, gesso panels and carpets. Culturally significant as a venue in Glasgow where women first began to socialise outside the home this room is once again used for its original purpose. The Tea Rooms are operated under the governance of The Trust as a social enterprise with the objectives of creating training, learning, employment and other opportunities and support for young people and communities. The Prince‚Äôs Trust and Dumfries House are partners in providing training for the young people who work at The Tea Rooms and receive training and career-building experience.

Hybrid zones can form in situ due to the evolution of a new lineage but generally they result from secondary contact of the parental forms after a period of geographic isolation, which allowed their differentiation (or speciation). Hybrid zones are useful in studying the genetics of speciation as they can provide natural examples of differentiation and (sometimes) gene flow between populations that are at some point between representing a single species and representing multiple species in reproductive isolation. Definition Hybrid zones are areas where the hybrid offspring of two divergent taxa (species, subspecies or genetic \\"forms\\") are prevalent and there is a cline in the genetic composition of populations from one taxon to the other. The two (or more) genetically differentiated species or lineages contributing to formation of a hybrid zone are regarded as parental forms. Precise definitions of hybrid zones vary; some insist on increased variability of fitness within the zone, others that hybrids be identifiably different from parental forms and others that they represent secondary contact alone.Murray, 1985 The widths of such zones can vary from tens of metres to hundreds of kilometres. The shape of the zones (clines) can be gradual or stepped. Additionally, hybrid zones may be ephemeral or long-lasting. Some hybrid zones can be seen as presenting a paradox for the biological definition of a species, usually given as \\"a population of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals that produce fertile offspring\\" under what has become known as the Biological Species Concept. Under this definition, both parental forms could be argued to be the same species if they produce fertile offspring at least some of the time. However, the two parental populations or species often remain identifiably distinct, conforming to an alternative, and presently preferred concept of species as \\"taxa that retain their identity despite gene flow\\". The clines of hybrid zones can be observed by recording the frequency of certain diagnostic alleles or phenotypic characteristics for either population along a transect between the two parental populations or species. Often the clines take the form of a sigmoidal curve. They can be wide (gradual) or narrow (steep) depending on the ratio of hybrid survival to recombination of genes. Hybrid zones which show no regular transition from one taxon to the other, but rather a patchy distribution of parental forms and subpopulations with hybrid background, are termed mosaic hybrid zones. =Forms= Hybrid zones can be either primary or secondary. Primary hybrid zones occur where divergence is taking place between adjacent populations of a previously homogeneous species, possibly leading to parapatric speciation. As a population spreads across a contiguous area it may spread into an abruptly different environment. Through adaptation to the new environment, the adjacent populations begin parapatric divergence. The point of contact between the older population and the newer population is ideally a stepped cline, but due to dispersal across the line, hybridization takes place and a hybrid zone arises. Secondary hybrid zones in turn arise from secondary contact between two populations that were previously allopatric.In practice it can be quite difficult to distinguish between primary and secondary contact by observing an existing hybrid zone. Most of the prominent, recognized hybrid zones are thought to be secondary. One form of hybrid zone results where one species has undergone allopatric speciation and the two new populations regain contact after a period of geographic isolation. The two populations then mate within an area of contact, producing 'hybrids' which contain a mixture of the alleles distinctive for each population. Thus novel genes flow from either side into the hybrid zone. Genes can also flow back into the distinct populations through interbreeding between hybrids and parental (non-hybrid) individuals (introgression). These processes lead to the formation of a cline between the two pure forms within the hybrid zone. In the centre of such a cline, hybrizymes are commonly found. These are alleles that are normally rare in both species but, probably due to genetic hitchhiking on genes for hybrid fitness, reach high frequencies in the areas where most hybrids are formed. Whereas some hybrid zones may break down due to selection against hybrid individuals (e.g. driving the evolution of reproductive character displacement) or merging of the parental forms, hybrid zones and gene flow do not inevitably lead to merging of the two populations involved, and some hybrid zones may be retained for thousands of years. Some persistent hybrid zones are 'tension zones', where the conflicting effects of dispersal of parental forms and selection against hybrids balance each other. Dispersal of individual parents leads to the creation of more hybrids within the hybrid zone. This may result in introgression between the two parental populations because of backcrossing. However, in the tension zone model, hybrids are less fit than parental forms (perhaps because they lack the coadapted gene complexes of the parentals that make them well adapted to the environments on either side of the hybrid zone), or even inviable or sterile. Inviability or sterility of hybrids forms a barrier to gene flow by making a 'hybrid sink' into which genes from parentals flow but rarely continue into the other parental population. Statistical models suggest that neutral alleles flow across this barrier very slowly, while positively selected alleles move across quite rapidly. An interesting outcome of this model is that tension zones are almost environment independent and can therefore move and empirical cases of this have been found. In contrast to the tension zone model, the bounded hybrid superiority hypothesis predicts that hybrid fitness is enhanced in environments that are intermediate between those of the parental populations or lineages, yielding 'hybrid superiority'. Another model for a persistent hybrid zone is the ecotonal model, in which a hybrid zone occurs over an environmental gradient with each parental lineage being adapted to one part of that gradient. The frequency of alleles finding different equilibria therefore depends on the precise environmental conditions in a particular area. In each location, selection maintains a stable equilibria for each allele, resulting in a smooth cline. The hybrids must therefore be fitter at some point along the cline. Another model is the wave of advance model that sees multiple clines for individual alleles forming due to the progression of advantageous alleles from one population the other. Under the mosaic model, the hybrid zone is maintained by parentals distributed across the landscape among a mosaic of recurring hybrids which are selected against. Certain factors contribute to stability and steepness of hybrid zones within these models by reducing the frequency of inter-population mating and introgression. These include positive assortative mating within populations, habitat selection of different populations and hybrid unfitness. Additionally, it is suggested that individuals in populations near a tension zone (in which hybrids are less fit), evolve methods of only mating with their own population to reduce the prevalence of unfit hybrids. This is dubbed reinforcement, and its importance remains controversial.  Marine hybrid zone case study  Mytilus edulis Hybrid zones are thought to be less common in marine than terrestrial environments. However, blue mussel populations show extensive hybridisation worldwide and are a well studied example of a marine hybrid zone. There are multiple sites of hybridisation between the closely related species Mytilus edulis, Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis across the North Atlantic and Pacific coasts. These hybrid zones vary considerably. Some hybrid zones, such as the one in Newfoundland in Canada show remarkably few hybrids, while in the Baltic Sea most individuals are hybrids. Based on the fossil record and genetic marker studies the following chronology is used to explain the Canadian mussel hybrid zone: *The genus Mytilus is at one point restricted to the North Pacific but spreads to the Atlantic through the Bering Strait around . *M. trossulus evolves in the North Pacific and M. edulis in the Atlantic in near allopatry as migration across the Bering Strait is very low. *Recently, in post-glacial times, M. trossulus from the Pacific enters the Atlantic and colonises shores on both sides, and meets with the local M. edulis. The Canadian mussel hybrid zone is unusual because both species are found along the entire shore (a mosaic pattern) instead of the typical cline found in most hybrid zones. Studies of mtDNA and allozymes in adult populations show that the distribution of genotypes between the two species is bimodal; pure parental types are most common (representing above 75% of individuals) while backcrosses close to parental forms are the next most prevalent. F1 hybrid crosses represent less than 2.5% of individuals. The low frequency of F1 hybrids coupled with some introgression allows us to infer that although fertile hybrids can be produced, significant reproductive barriers exist and the two species are sufficiently deviated that they are now able to avoid recombinational collapse despite habitat sharing. One reason that could account for keeping taxa separate through prezygotic isolation is that in this region M. edulis spawns over a narrow 2‚Äì3 week period in July, while M. trossulus spawned over a more extensive period between late spring to early autumn. No infertility or developmental retardation was found in the hybrid individuals, allowing them to introgress with pure species.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics, and Detroit Tigers. Career Born in Aurora, Illinois, Becker was selected in the third round of the 1990 MLB draft out of West Aurora High School by the Minnesota Twins. In high school Becker, played competitive football and baseball. In football, he played quarterback and running back on offense and corner back on defense. However, he excelled on the baseball diamond and as a result had come to the attention of elite college baseball programs and scouts from MLB. Becker spent his first minor league season with the Elizabethton Twins. He played in 56 games, had 194 at- bats with 56 base hits, including six home runs for a .289 batting average. He played for the Kenosha Twins, Visalia Oaks and the Nashville Xpress teams before being called up to the Minnesota Twins in 1993. Becker made his MLB debut in 1993 as a switch hitter. Appearing in three games with seven at-bats, getting two hits and it was decided that he needed another trip to the PCL Salt Lake Buzz before getting a full-time job. He was called upon again in 1994 and in 28 games with 98 at-bats he hit .265. However, he achieved greater success batting exclusively from the left side of the plate. During the 1995 minor league season, for 36 games he hit .316 and was called up again to the show with the Minnesota Twins. 1995 was Becker's first full year with the Twins. In 1996, manager Tom Kelly put Becker in the position of succeeding Kirby Puckett as the Twins starting center fielder. However, he responded with his best year as a major leaguer, batting .291 with 12 home runs, 71 runs batted in (RBIs) and 19 stolen bases. On July 13 of that year, he had his best day, getting four hits‚Äîincluding two home runs, a double, and six RBIs. However, his numbers declined the following year, and the Twins traded Becker for Alex Ochoa in December 1997. Subsequent to the trade, Becker bounced among several teams, finding marginal playing time with the Baltimore Orioles, New York Mets, Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics, and Detroit Tigers. Following the 2002 season, Becker retired from baseball. His career stats in 789 MLB games are: 2,227 at-bats, 570 base hits, with 45 home runs with a .256 batting average and 66 stolen bases. Becker's minor league numbers show 770 games, 2,851 at-bats, 821 hits, with 75 home runs and a .287 batting average. Becker had spent 13 seasons in professional baseball and was just 31 years of age upon retirement. Rich Becker was the only player to come out of the third round of the 1990 draft and sustain any sort of long-term career.

After just a couple of played matches the club changed its name into FK Sremac Zemun. By the end of that year another club is also formed in Zemun, FK Sparta Zemun. On 20 October 1946, the two clubs were merged to form a new sports society whose football section was FK Jedinstvo Zemun.Copy of the history page of former official website at ticketservis.com By 1962, the club got promotion into the group East of the Yugoslav Second League, which was divided back then into two geographical groups, East and West. It stayed at Second national level for two seasons, after which it returned into the Serbian republic league, Yugoslav third tier. In the late 1960s, the club struggled financially, and on February 23, 1969, it is merged with FK Galenika, a club sponsored by the Galenika a.d., a pharmaceutical company located in Zemun. Under the new name FK Galenika Zemun, and with new financial backing, the club soon returned to the higher leagues, winning promotion as soon as 1970 to the Yugoslav Second League.Copy of the history page of former official website at ticketservis.com Coached by Ivan ƒåabrinoviƒá, the club became one of the strongest teams in the second league, and after several times being close, it finally reached promotion to the Yugoslav First League in 1982. In that same season, the club reached the semi- finals of the 1981‚Äì82 Yugoslav Cup where they lost against the cup winners Red Star Belgrade. The club played in the 1982‚Äì83 Yugoslav First League however it finished bottom of the table subsequently relegated back to the Second League. On 1 January 1985, the club changed its name into the one that still carries nowadays, FK Zemun.Copy of the history page of former official website at ticketservis.com During the late 1980s, the club had fallen into the lower leagues, but after the stabilization of their financial situation the club began rising again. In 1990, after two consecutive promotions, the club was back in the 1990‚Äì91 Yugoslav First League. This time the club stabilized in the top league and even managed to achieve good results, like fourth place in the 1992‚Äì93 First League of FR Yugoslavia, just behind the best Serbian clubs Partizan, Red Star and Vojvodina, or the 5th place archive in the 1993‚Äì94 First League of FR Yugoslavia. In the 1992‚Äì93 season the club had reached again the semi-finals of the Yugoslav Cup.Copy of the history page of former official website at ticketservis.com FK Zemun competed in the top league all the way until 2007. In the season 2004‚Äì05 they managed to achieve 5th place once more.FK Zemun league standings since 2001 at Srbijafudbal In 2007, Zemun competed in the Serbian First League and came away with the 15th position and an automatic relegation to the Serbian League Belgrade, third tier. FK Zemun played in the 2007‚Äì08 Serbian Cup and found its way to the final. The club won three matches after penalties, defeated two first league sides and goalie Nemanja Jov≈°iƒá was voted most valuable player. They lost the final 3‚Äì0 to Serbian team Partizan but since Partizan had already qualified for the Champions League Zemun were given the UEFA Cup spot as they were the runners- up. During the summer, however, Zemun was not able to obtain a license from UEFA and had to give their spot to fourth-placed side Borac ƒåaƒçak. Borac then gave their Intertoto Cup spot to OFK Beograd. In 2008‚Äì09, Zemun became the champion of Serbian League Belgrade and were back to the Serbian First League after only one season. In 2015‚Äì16, Zemun was promoted again to the Serbian First League. The following year after a bad start, they fired manager Neboj≈°a Milo≈°eviƒá, hired Dragoljub Bekvalac, then fired him and later hired Milan MilanoviƒáMilanoviƒá menja Bekvalca at fudbal.info.com, 30-8-2016 In November 2017, a news website Srbijadanas.rs, published a research in which they found that FK Zemun is the club that transferred more players, 35 at that time, than any other club to the Serbian \\"Big two\\" eternal rivals, Partizan and Red Star Belgrade.ODUVEK JE BIO RASADNIK FUDBALERA: Zemun dao Zvezdi i Partizanu vi≈°e od 30 igraƒça (FOTO) at srbijadanas,rs, 21-11-2017, retrieved 22-2-2020 Honours ;Yugoslav Second League (2): *1981‚Äì82 Group east, 1988‚Äì89 ;Serbian Cup: *finalist: 2007‚Äì08 ;Serbian League Belgrade: *2014‚Äì15 ;Serbian Republic League: *1977‚Äì78, 1986‚Äì87, 1987‚Äì88 Stadium The official stadium of FK Zemun is Zemun Stadium and can host up to 9,588 spectators.

The group was formed in 1987. The first organised supporting groups of back then FK Galenika begin to appear by mid-1980s. In 1986 the first ultras groups were formed under the names of Testas Caldas, Pajtosi and Godfathers. In 1987 the three groups united under the name Taurunum. The name comes from the Latin name of a settlement that existed in Roman period in the place where Zemun is located nowadays, and that was named Taurunum. The group stands in the north stand of the stadium. Some supporting groups out of the town of Zemun are formed, the most important being the Rangers from Panƒçevo. In 1995 by the end of the Yugoslav Wars there is a generational turn-over, and the group standing in the east stand formed by younger supporters and named The Boys ‚Äì Dragons, joins Taurunum in the north stand forming a bigger group renamed Taurunum Boys. The moto of the group becomes \\"One city, one club, only Zemun\\".http://www.ultras- tifo.net/interviews/412-interview-with-taurunum-boys-zemun-serbia.html Nowadays the group is composed of several sub-groups, and beside supporting their club FK Zemun, they are usually present at the matches of the Serbian national team.

Jean Le Capelain (plaque in Saint Helier). A plaque in St Helier marks the approximate site of the artist's house and studio. John Le Capelain, later known as Jean, (1812‚Äì1848) was a painter often claimed to have been born in Saint Helier, Jersey, the son of Samuel Le Capelain, a printer and lithographer, and Elizabeth Anne Pinckney, his English wife. He was actually born in London and baptised there two days after his parents married there. After returning to his father's native island, he followed his father's trade in lithography but abandoned it later in life. He also learned the art of painting, without any formal training. About 1832 he returned to London and practiced as water-colour painter. His technique gave his paintings a particularly misty and foggy effect. After Queen Victoria's visit to Jersey in 1846, a volume of drawings by Le Capelain of scenery of the island was presented to her as an official souvenir by the States of Jersey. This led to his receiving a commission from the Queen to paint pictures of the Isle of Wight. While engaged on these he developed tuberculosis, of which he died in Jersey in 1848. A view of Mont Orgueil by Le Capelain was used on the reverse of the 1976 Jersey ¬£20 banknote.Jersey Weekly Post, 12 August 1976 Public collections The Jersey Heritage Trust today holds some of his paintings. A collection of his works, presented by public subscription in his memory, is displayed in the Parish Hall of St. Helier.

In a span of less than ten years‚Äî1807 to 1816‚Äîthe Banda Oriental and its capital city of Montevideo were occupied by the English, retaken by the Spanish, and invaded by the Portuguese. In 1816 Portuguese Brazil took Banda Oriental from the north, ousting the province's hero Jos√© Gervasio Artigas in 1820 and forcing him into exile in Paraguay. Banda Oriental became a province of Brazil, which achieved independence from Portugal in 1822. In 1825 a group of exiled Uruguayan fighters called the 33 Orientals returned from Buenos Aires. They were led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja, who had fought with the exiled Artigas. The 33 Orientals secretly crossed the Plata River, landing on the Eastern Bank on 19 April. There they planted what would be known as the flag of the 33 Orientals and took an oath to kick the Brazilian government out of Uruguay.

A spirited, vivacious young woman with a devil-may-care attitude, Etta first appeared in Sensation Comics #2 (1942), written by Wonder Woman's creator William Moulton Marston. Enrolled in the fictional Holliday College for Women (and often accompanied by her fellow students, \\"the Holliday Girls\\"), Etta would become a constant feature of Wonder Woman's Golden Age adventures, effectively functioning as both the hero's plucky sidekick and her best friend in Man's World. Unapologetically proud of her plus-size figure (and vocal about her love of sweets), \\"Etta's appearance was a stark contrast to the svelte, wasp-waisted women depicted in most comic books, and Etta was a brave and heroic leader who was always in the thick of the fight beside her friend Wonder Woman.\\" Though appearing less frequently in the Silver and Bronze Age, Etta was a recurring presence in Wonder Woman's supporting cast throughout both periods. She would be re-imagined in March 1987Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #2 by comics writer/artist George P√©rez as part of his reboot of the Wonder Woman mythos. This version, a former Air Force captain and intelligence officer, appeared consistently throughout Wonder Woman's post-Crisis adventures.Jimenez, (2010) pp. 406-407. Beatrice Colen portrayed the character in the 1970s Wonder Woman series. Etta made her cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe in the 2017 film Wonder Woman, played by Lucy Davis. Character history =Golden Age= Etta Candy in her original golden age incarnation. Art by H. G. Peter.In her 1940s introduction, Etta Candy is a sickly malnourished woman Wonder Woman discovers at a local hospital. [Note, this version is from the Wonder Woman comic strip and written after Etta's first appearance in the comic books.] When next seen, Etta is transformed into a spirited, rotund young woman who has a great love of candy. When Wonder Woman asks her what caused her sudden health and rather large size, Etta tells her that she was rejuvenated by eating many sweets. With her newfound confidence, Etta Candy soon after leads the fictional Beeta Lambda sorority at Holiday College and aids Wonder Woman in her adventures, first with a hundred other girls she helps Wonder Woman to take over the Nazi base of Doctor Poison without endangering Steve. Throughout her adventures with Wonder Woman she is known for her moxie, her love of candy, and for her trademark call \\"Woo! Woo!\\" (A catch-phrase derived, in part, from exclamations associated with comic actor Hugh Herbert and Curly Howard of The Three Stooges. Other versions of the character have been known to say \\"Woo! Woo!\\" and according to at least one version it is a sorority cry at Holiday College.) Other familiar characteristics included her junky car nicknamed Esmerelda, and a variety of sassy interjections, such as: \\"For the love of chocolate!\\" Her father, \\"Hard Candy,\\" and mother, Sugar Candy, lived on the Bar-L Ranch in Brazos County, Texas, that provided the setting for cowboy-themed adventures. She was shown to have a brother named Mint Candy who served as a soldier in the US Army. Holiday College was the setting for science-driven stories and it was at nearby \\"Starvard\\" (portmanteau of Stanford and Harvard), that her boyfriend, the gangling but very loving \\"Oscar Sweetgulper,\\" studied. She was shown to be brave and even stormed a Nazi concentration camp armed with nothing but a box of candy to rescue captured children. She was also welcomed by Wonder Woman's people, the Amazons of Themyscira and even invited to their festivals. She was aware of her weight but never let it bother her. She even joked about it when asked by the Amazons if she would like to join in one of their sporting events. =Silver and Bronze Age= When Robert Kanigher became writer and editor of the adventures of Wonder Woman, he made little use of Etta Candy and the Holiday girls. When he did, he portrayed Etta as an insecure, weight- conscious girl who followed but never led the girls in her sorority. This was in sharp contrast to Marston characterization of a bold, sassy, wisecracking leader. Despite a few appearances after Kanigher reintroduced her in 1960 (Wonder Woman #117) Candy was left in limbo for decades. Etta Candy was revived twenty years later in 1980 (Wonder Woman #272), along with Steve Trevor and General Phil Darnell. In the years since her last appearance, Candy had not only graduated from Holiday College, but had become a Lieutenant and was on hand to welcome Wonder Woman back to her old job as Air Force officer Diana Prince something she hadn't done since 1968. Lieutenant Candy was featured as a secretary to Darnell and as Diana's roommate. Despite having been Wonder Woman's friend years previous, Candy had never met Diana Prince or learned her secret identity. Thus, from Candy's point of view, she and Prince met for the first time when Prince returned to the Air Force. She was still portrayed as insecure and weight-conscious and, although she no longer said \\"for the love of chocolate\\", was known to swear by Betty Crocker. She also did most of the cooking between herself and her roommate. Her family was not expanded as much as was the family of her golden age incarnation though she did remark on being from a large family and had a niece named Suzie. Her love interest was now nerdy, hopelessly clumsy but nevertheless very loving Howard Huckaby. In one adventure, Etta was kidnapped by Satanists influenced by Klarion the Witch Boy and sent to Hell, where Wonder Woman and Etrigan the demon had to travel to save her, although she remained narcotized and catatonic throughout the ordeal. In the years leading up to Crisis on Infinite Earths (1986), writers Dan Mishkin and Mindy Newell took Etta in a different direction. She displayed more confidence, and even became Wonder Woman for one evening, battling Cheetah, Angle Man, Captain Wonder and Silver Swan. Huckaby, who by then had been convinced for several issues that his girlfriend was the comic book's titular heroine, used Dr. Psycho's machine that could turn his dreams into reality to let the world see Etta as he saw her. After the Amazonian \\"Wonder Etta\\" defeated the villains, she and others saw she was his Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #323 =Modern Age= After the 1987 Greg Potter‚ÄìGeorge P√©rez revamp of Wonder Woman, Etta was romantically linked with, and eventually married to, Steve Trevor, who was no longer Diana's love interest. A career Air Force officer, Etta served as Steve Trevor's aide when he was framed for treason as part of Ares' scheme to spark a global war. Etta was fiercely dedicated to her friends, and her faith in Steve's innocence helped him clear his name, even though the two temporarily became fugitives while helping Wonder Woman overthrow Ares' plans. While on the run, Steve and Etta realized their love for one another. A happy couple, they remained friends with Wonder Woman. Feeling insecure about her weight, Etta developed an eating disorder that was kept secret from her friends.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #78 She was able to lose 20 pounds, but at the expense of her health. When she finally collapsed due to a lack of food in front of Wonder Woman while trying on wedding gowns, Diana advised her to take better care of herself and maintain a sensible diet. Since that time, Etta has gained her original weight back. Etta and Steve largely disappeared from the pages of Wonder Woman during the run of writer/artist John Byrne, and they appeared infrequently since then. She did appear once Diana lost her royal title during writer Phil Jimenez's run as her usual supportive friend, but was depicted as still insecure about her heavy weight and apprehensive about her marriage to Steve. Writer Gail Simone later reintroduced Etta Candy as an intelligence officer requested by Sarge Steel to report on Diana Prince and her associations.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #14 This took place following the Infinite Crisis which altered Diana's origins and to an extent the origins of her supporting cast. Etta remained married to Steve Trevor and was a close friend of Diana and was also aware of Diana's dual identity. The full extent of her history with Diana following the new DCU continuity is not known. Etta joined Wonder Woman on the Khund homeworld to convince an alien race called the 'Ichor' to cease their attacks.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #19 She was successful but returned to Earth only to be tortured by the villain Genocide, leaving her in a coma state.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #32 She eventually regained consciousness in the hospital some time during the next few issues, and after imploring Diana to not feel guilty over her torture at the hands of Genocide revealed that she was recruited as an operative by Mr. Terrific and The Green Lantern as part of the U.N. Authority's observation of the D.M.A. three years earlier.Wonder Woman (vol 3.) #40 =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Etta Candy appeared in the new Justice League title as Steve Trevor's secretary. She was now African American and depicted as young and ambitious, resembling the Etta played by Tracie Thoms in the unaired David E. Kelly Wonder Woman pilot. Trevor soon came to trust Etta, admitting to her secrets he kept close to himself, such as being in love with Wonder Woman.Justice League #7 (March 2012) During the Forever Evil storyline, Steve Trevor returned to the ruins of Washington DC's A.R.G.U.S. headquarters where Etta Candy told him that the destruction was caused by a massive spike in Doctor Light's body where the energies emitted from it exposed the A.R.G.U.S. agents. Etta Candy was later approached by an energy manifestation of Doctor Light.Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S. #1 =Rebirth= After the events of Rebirth, Etta Candy continued working with Steve Trevor, but has been promoted to Commander Candy.Wonder Woman vol. 5 #1 (Aug 2016) Flashbacks throughout the story revealed Etta became friends with Dr. Barbara Minerva prior to becoming Cheetah and developed romantic feelings for her, which Barbara was implied to have returned. Etta is later referenced as working closely with A.R.G.U.S., a government group skilled in dealing with the super-human and super-natural. Justice League Dark #1 (2018) Other versions =Seven Soldiers= Writer Grant Morrison used an aged version of Etta as a counselor in the first issue of Seven Soldiers: Zatanna and showed her as a convention speaker in Seven Soldiers: Bulleteer. =Earth-Two= During DC Comics' Pre-Crisis era, the Golden Age versions of its characters were revived. They were retroactively said to have lived on an alternate dimension dubbed Earth-Two thus explaining why the regular Wonder Woman and her supporting cast could appear youthful despite the \\"original\\" Wonder Woman having appeared decades earlier. Etta Candy was no exception although her Earth-Two self differed slightly from her Golden Age self. For example, she was shown working for the military instead of being a college student. (Thus was done in order to tie into the popular Wonder Woman television series which was set in the 1940s in order to utilize the titular heroine's Golden Age adventures. (Wonder Woman Vol. 1 #229)) In order to harmonize the two versions, it was later explained that this Etta Candy was a college student but had put her studies on hold to serve her country. At war's end, she resumed her studies and became a dietitian. Later appearances of the Earth-Two Etta Candy show her being much more faithful to her Golden Age self. =Superman & Batman: Generations= She makes an appearance in the Superman & Batman: Generations miniseries by John Byrne. Generations takes a different approach from the aforementioned example by imagining a world wherein superheroes age in real time relative to their original appearance in comic books. Thus, by 1953 Etta Candy is happily married to Oscar Sweetgulper, her Golden Age beau, and is Mrs. Etta Candy Sweetgulper. =Wonder Woman: Amazonia= She appears in Wonder Woman: Amazonia, a Wonder Woman story set in a Victorian Britain. There, Etta grew up a hungry, homeless, destitute orphan on the streets of London. Her only friend was Diana, the girl that would grow up to be Wonder Woman. After they grew up and Diana was offered a job in show business exhibiting her great strength, Etta bid goodbye to her friend. She married an army man but she was forced to take up prostitution in order to survive after he took to drink and abandoned her. When she and Diana were reunited years later, she managed to get a job as a nanny for Diana's children, one of whom was named Etta in honor of her mother's best friend. At the climax of the story, the villain tries to kidnap Wonder Woman's daughters (among other things) but Etta bravely rescues them. It closes with Etta Candy as governess to the Princesses Etta and Victoria and best friend to their mother Queen Diana of Britain and Themyscira. =Wednesday Comics= Etta appears as a major supporting character in the Wonder Woman story serialized in Wednesday Comics. In the alternate reality featured in the storyline, Etta is a teenager who befriends the young Diana when she first arrives in America. Etta is eventually kidnapped by Diana's other friend, Priscilla Rich, and is used as bait in a trap set by Doctor Poison. With Etta bound and gagged by Priscilla, Poison attempts to use her as a test subject for her chemicals, only to be defeated when Diana arrives and rescues her friend. =Convergence: Wonder Woman= A Pre-Crisis version of Etta appears in \\"Convergence: Wonder Woman\\". She alerts Wonder Woman to a doomsday cult which has risen from the events of Convergence. She tries to save Wonder Woman from the fanatical followers, but is spirited away by the vampire Joker from the Red Rain universe. Wonder Woman finds her bitten and drained, though she subsequently becomes a vampire in service of the Joker. She is killed when Steve Trevor, also made a vampire, resists the Joker's control and plunges both of them into a deep chasm opened during the battle. =Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman= In Neil Kleid's \\"Ghosts and Gods,\\" his addition to the collaborative collection \\"Sensation Comics featuring Wonder Woman Volume 1,\\" Etta is seen as an active sidekick to the Amazonian Princess, helping her raid Ra's Al Ghul's stronghold. Etta shows skill with a grappling hook during the adventure. Etta doesn't get to say much for herself, because when the pair is captured, \\"Deadman\\" inhabits her body to help Wonder Woman complete the mission. Sensation Comics featuring Wonder Woman Vol 1 #8 (May 2015) =The All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold= Etta makes an appearance in the comic book version of Batman: The Brave and the Bold. =Wonder Woman: Earth One= Etta appears in Wonder Woman: Earth One, but renamed Beth. She's similar to the Pre-Crisis Earth-Two version, being a spirited, plump young woman and the head of the Holiday Girls. She appears to be a lesbian (or possibly bisexual) as she's intrigued by Wonder Woman's stories of Themyscira, an island full of women, but is put off by their attitudes as it \\"spoil[s] [her] fantasy\\". She and the Holiday Girls also designed Wonder Woman's costume. She accompanied Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor to Themyscira for Wonder Woman's trial to defend her; all the other Amazons (except Hippolyta) were disgusted by her appearance. =The Legend of Wonder Woman= Etta Candy appears as a major supporting character in this alternate re-telling of Wonder Woman's origin. The Holliday Girls are also featured in supporting roles. The Legend of Wonder Woman #1-8 (2016) =Smallville Season Eleven= Etta Candy appears as a Lieutenant of United States Air Force. She was described as an excellent pilot and was chosen to escort Queen Hippolyta back to Themyscira. She called her plane the \\"invisible plane\\". Smallville Season Eleven #19 (2014) In other media =Television= Beatrice Colen as Corporal Etta Candy. * Beatrice Colen portrayed Etta in the first season of Wonder Woman which aired from 1976 and 1977 on ABC. She was General Phil Blankenship's secretary in this television series. This version of the character was plump rather than obese. Although she was still clearly there to provide comic relief, the show decided to not make fun of her weight. Instead, the writers portrayed her as a woman of very limited intelligence. * Tracie Thoms played Etta in David E Kelley's 2011 unaired Wonder Woman pilot. =Film= * Etta Candy appears in the animated direct-to-DVD film, Wonder Woman, voiced by California-born actress Julianne Grossman. In this film, Etta is a slim secretary to Steve Trevor who shamelessly uses her feminine charm on her colleague much to Diana's disgust. * Etta Candy is portrayed by Lucy Davis in the 2017 Wonder Woman film, in the character's first live action theatrical appearance.Wonder Woman (2017 film) In this version, she is portrayed as red- haired as opposed to blond and is British as opposed to American. * Etta Candy appears in the animated film Wonder Woman: Bloodlines as an openly lesbian African-American, voiced by Adrienne C. Moore. =Video games= * In the video game Justice League Heroes, one of the buildings is a restaurant called \\"Etta's\\" including a classic image of the character. * In Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure, three versions of Etta Candy are among the thousands of characters that can be summoned by the player.

Granting for the sake of argument that the fetus has a right to life, Thomson uses thought experiments to argue that the fetus's right to life does not trump the pregnant woman's right to have jurisdiction over her body, and that induced abortion is therefore not morally impermissible. Her argument has many critics on both sides of the abortion debate,e.g., Schwarz 1990, Beckwith 1993 and Lee 1996 on the anti-abortion side; Tooley 1972, Warren 1973, Steinbock 1992 and McMahan 2002 on the pro-choice side yet continues to receive defense.Kamm 1992; Boonin 2003: ch 4 Thomson's imaginative examples and controversial conclusions have made \\"A Defense of Abortion\\" perhaps \\"the most widely reprinted essay in all of contemporary philosophy\\".Parent 1986: vii Overview of the essay =The violinist= In \\"A Defense of Abortion\\", Thomson grants for the sake of argument that the fetus has a right to life, but defends the permissibility of abortion by appeal to a thought experiment: :You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.Thomson 1971: 48‚Äì49. Thomson says that one can now permissibly unplug themself from the violinist even though this will cause his death: this is due to limits on the right to life, which does not include the right to use another person's body, and so by unplugging the violinist, one does not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something--the use of someone else's body--to which he has no right. \\"[I]f you do allow him to go on using your kidneys, this is a kindness on your part, and not something he can claim from you as his due.\\"Thomson 1971: 55 For the same reason, Thomson says, abortion does not violate the fetus's legitimate right to life, but merely deprives the fetus of something-- the non-consensual use of the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions --to which it has no right. Thus, by choosing to terminate her pregnancy, Thomson concludes that a pregnant woman does not normally violate the fetus's right to life, but merely withdraws its use of her own body, which usually causes the fetus to die.Thomson 1971: 63; Boonin 2003: 133‚Äì134 =Third-party participation ‚Äì the \\"expanding child\\"= Thomson criticizes the common method of deducing a woman's right to abort from the permissibility of a third party committing the abortion. In almost all instances, a woman's right to abortion may hinge on the doctor's willingness to perform it. If the doctor refuses, then the woman is denied her right. To base the woman's right on the accordance or refusal of a doctor, she says, is to ignore the mother's full personhood, and subsequently, her rights to her body. Thomson presents the hypothetical example of the 'expanding child': :Suppose you find yourself trapped in a tiny house with a growing child. I mean a very tiny house, and a rapidly growing child--you are already up against the wall of the house and in a few minutes you'll be crushed to death. The child on the other hand won't be crushed to death; if nothing is done to stop him from growing he'll be hurt, but in the end he'll simply burst open the house and walk out a free man.Thomson 1971: 52 Thomson concedes that a third party indeed cannot make the choice to kill either the person being crushed or the child. However, this does not mean that the person being crushed cannot act in self-defense and attack the child to save his or her own life. To liken this to pregnancy, the mother can be thought to be the house, the fetus the growing-child. In such a case, the mother's life is being threatened, and the fetus is the one who threatens it. Because for no reason should the mother's life be threatened, and also for no reason is the fetus threatening it, both are innocent, and thus no third party can intervene. But, Thomson says, the person threatened can intervene, by which justification a mother can rightfully abort.Thomson 1971: 52‚Äì53 Continuing, Thomson returns to the 'expanding child' example and points out: :For what we have to keep in mind is that the mother and the unborn child are not like two tenants in a small house, which has, by unfortunate mistake, been rented to both: the mother owns the house. The fact that she does adds to the offensiveness of deducing that the mother can do nothing from the supposition that third parties can do nothing. But it does more than this: it casts a bright light on the supposition that third parties can do nothing.Thomson 1971: 53 If we say that no one may help the mother obtain an abortion, we fail to acknowledge the mother's right over her body (or property). Thomson says that we are not personally obligated to help the mother but this does not rule out the possibility that someone else may act. As Thomson reminds, the house belongs to the mother; similarly, the body which holds a fetus also belongs to the mother.Thomson 1971: 54 =Pregnancy resulting from voluntary intercourse ‚Äì ‚Äúpeople-seeds‚Äù= To illustrate an example of pregnancy due to voluntary intercourse, Thomson presents the 'people-seeds' situation: :Again, suppose it were like this: people-seeds drift about in the air like pollen, and if you open your windows, one may drift in and take root in your carpets or upholstery. You don't want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare occasions does happen, one of the screens is defective; and a seed drifts in and takes root.Thomson 1971: 59 Here, the people-seeds flying through the window represent conception, despite the precautionary mesh screen, which functions as contraception. The woman does not want a people-seed to root itself in her house, and so she even takes the measure to protect herself with the best mesh screens, and then voluntarily opens the windows. However, in the event that one people-seed finds its way through her window screens, unwelcome as it may be, does the simple fact that the woman knowingly risked such an occurrence when opening her window deny her the ability to rid her house of the intruder? Thomson notes that some may argue the affirmative to this question, claiming that \\"...after all you could have lived out your life with bare floors and furniture, or with sealed windows and doors\\". But by this logic, she says, any woman could avoid pregnancy due to rape by simply having a hysterectomy ‚Äì an extreme procedure simply to safeguard against such a possibility. Thomson concludes that although there may be times when the fetus does have a right to the mother's body, certainly in most cases the fetus does not have a right to the mother's body. This analogy raises the issue of whether all abortions are unjust killing. = Caveats = Thomson does not support unlimited abortion rights. She gives as an example a hypothetical woman who seeks a late-term abortion \\"just to avoid the nuisance of postponing a trip abroad\\" and declares this to be \\"positively indecent\\". Thomson also explicitly rejects the claim that pregnant women have a right to kill their offspring. She argues for the right of the mother to stop being pregnant, even if this results in the death of the offspring, but not for the right to ensure that the offspring is dead. If, for example, a late-term abortion accidentally results in the birth of a living baby, then Thomson would conclude that the mother has no right to kill the baby. Criticism Critics of Thomson's argument generally grant the permissibility of unplugging the violinist, but seek to block the inference that abortion is permissible by arguing that there are morally relevant differences between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion. One notable exception to this general agreement is Peter Singer, who says that, despite our intuitions, a utilitarian calculus implies that one is morally obliged to stay connected to the violinist.Singer 2011:134 The most common objection is that Thomson's violinist argument can justify abortion only in cases of rape. In the violinist scenario, the woman was kidnapped: she did not consent to having the violinist plugged in and she did nothing to cause the violinist to be plugged in, just as a woman who is pregnant due to rape did nothing to cause her pregnancy. But in typical cases of abortion, the pregnant woman had intercourse voluntarily, and thus has either tacitly consented to allow the fetus to use her body (the tacit consent objection),e.g. Warren 1973; Steinbock 1992 or else has a duty to sustain the fetus because the woman herself caused the fetus to stand in need of her body (the responsibility objection).e.g. Beckwith 1993; McMahan 2002 Other common objections turn on the claim that the fetus is the pregnant woman's child, whereas the violinist is a stranger (the stranger versus offspring objection),e.g. Schwarz 1990; Beckwith 1993; McMahan 2002 or that abortion directly and intentionally kills the fetus, whereas unplugging the violinist merely lets him die of natural causes (the killing versus letting die objection). Defenders of Thomson's argumentBoonin 2003: 133‚Äì281 reply that the alleged disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not matter, either because the factors that critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but do not apply to abortion in the way that critics have claimed. Thomson's defenders also point to her 'people- seeds' argument as a strong analogy to typical cases of abortion. Thomson's article, by positing a moral justification for abortion even if one grants a fetal right to life, opened up a new avenue in the philosophical debate about the ethics of abortion. Critics of her view have formulated many objections to her argument, and defenders have responded in kind in a back and forth that continues in philosophy journals even now.

Education He attended the Pedro Guevara Memorial National High School and graduated from Colegio de San Juan de Letran, Manila, in 1896. Philippine Revolution He joined the Filipino forces during the Philippine Revolution and assisted in promoting the peace agreement of Biak na Bato at San Miguel, Bulacan, in 1897. He later rejoined the Filipino forces during the revolution, and also served throughout the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was the aide and private secretary to General Juan Cailles. Political career Later, he became a journalist for the Spanish language newspaper Soberania Nacional and Vidas Filipinas and a municipal councilor of San Felipe Neri, Rizal in 1907. He studied law at La Jurisprudencia and became a lawyer in private practice. His political life started when he became a member of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1909 to 1912 and a member of the Philippine Senate from 1916 to 1922. In 1921, Guevara was chair of the Philippine delegation to the Far Eastern Bar Conference at Beijing, China. He later was elected as a Nationalist Resident Commissioner to the House of Representatives of the Sixty-eighth United States Congress for a three-year term and four succeeding three-year terms (March 4, 1923 ‚Äì February 14, 1936). During this time, Guevara worked tirelessly for the approval of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act which would establish the Commonwealth of the Philippines and eventually its independence in 10 years. Later, he served as delegate of Laguna during the Constitutional Convention of 1934 which framed the 1935 Philippine Constitution. His term ended on February 14, 1936, when a successor qualified in accordance with the newly established Commonwealth of the Philippines was selected.

It directs the performer of the music passage to take a breath (for wind instruments and vocalists) or to make a slight pause (for non-wind instruments). This pause is normally intended to shorten the duration of the preceding note and not to alter the tempo; in this function it can be thought of as a grace rest. It is usually placed above the staff and at the ends of phrases. Its function is analogous to the comma in several written languages. Indeed, a common notation for the breath mark looks very similar to a written comma.

Biography The son of George Trefgarne, 1st Baron Trefgarne, Trefgarne succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Trefgarne in 1960 at the age of 19, having attended Haileybury and Imperial Service College. He took his seat in the House of Lords on his 21st birthday in 1962. In contrast to his father, who was a Liberal and later Labour politician, he chose to sit on the Conservative benches. Trefgarne was an opposition Whip from 1977 to 1979 and then served in the Conservative administration of Margaret Thatcher as a Government Whip from 1979 to 1981 and as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Trade in 1981, at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1981 to 1982, at the Department of Health and Social Security from 1982 to 1983 and at the Ministry of Defence from 1983 to 1985. The latter year he was promoted to Minister of State for Defence Support, a post he held until 1986, and then served as Minister of State for Defence Procurement from 1986 to 1989 and as a Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry from 1989 to 1990. In 1989 he was admitted to the Privy Council. He was president of the Institution of Incorporated Engineers when they merged with the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 2006. Lord Trefgarne is still a member of the House of Lords as one of the ninety hereditary peers elected by their colleagues to remain after the passing of the House of Lords Act of 1999. He has since blocked further reform of the Lords, tabling 'wrecking' amendments to a draft Bill to abolish by- elections for hereditary peers, proposed by Lord Grocott in 2018. He is currently the second-longest-serving member of the House after Lord Denham.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 7. He arrived at the Guantanamo detention camps on 11 January 2002, and was held there until 31 May 2014. He was released, along with the other four members of the so-called Taliban five‚ÄîKhairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Norullah Noori, and Mohammad Nabi Omari in exchange for the release of United States Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl, a convicted deserter who had been held captive by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network. Background Not much is known about Fazl, except that he served as the deputy defense minister under the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban rule).Lawmakers may seek to block Taliban transfer by Mark Hosenball and Missy Ryan. January 6, 2012. name=UyghurCongress2006-04-28> American intelligence analysts estimate that Fazl was born in 1967, in Sekzi, Caher Cineh District, Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan. Although he negotiated an amnesty with the Afghan Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum, it is alleged that he is responsible for killing thousands of Shi'a Afghans between 1996 and late 2001. Held aboard the USS Bataan Former Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef described being flown to the United States Navy's amphibious warfare vessel, the , for special interrogation. Zaeef wrote that the cells were located six decks down, were only 1 meter by 2 meters. He wrote that the captives weren't allowed to speak with one another, but that he \\"eventually saw that Mullahs Fazal, Noori, Burhan, Wasseeq Sahib and Rohani were all among the other prisoners.\\" Historian Andy Worthington, author of The Guantanamo Files, identified Fazil as one of the men Zaeef recognized. Release negotiations Most Afghans had been repatriated to Afghanistan by 2009. Throughout the fall of 2011 and the winter of 2012, the United States conducted peace negotiations with the Taliban, and widely leaked was that a key sticking point was the ongoing detention of Fazl and four other senior Taliban, Norullah Noori, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammed Nabi. Negotiations hinged on a proposal to send the five men directly to Doha, Qatar, where they would be allowed to set up an official office for the Taliban. In March 2012, it was reported that Ibrahim Spinzada, described as \\"Karzai's top aide\\" had spoken with the five men, in Guantanamo, earlier that month, and had secured their agreement to be transferred to Qatar. It was reported that Karzai, who had initially opposed the transfer, now backed the plan. Joint Review Task Force When he assumed office in January 2009 President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Mohammed Fazl was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release, would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board, less than a quarter of men have received a review. Release On June 1, 2014, Fazl, and the other four Taliban prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, were released in Qatar in exchange for U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl who had been captured by the Taliban nearly five years previously. Bergdahl later pleaded guilty to the crime of desertion on October 16, 2017. Fazl and other members of the Taliban five, as part of the conditions of their release, were prohibited from leaving Qatar for one year. Human Rights Watch argues that despite his release from Guantanamo Bay, Fazl should be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes.Gossman, Patricia (June 17, 2014) Prosecute Taliban Commander in Bergdahl Swap for War Crimes Human Rights Watch hrw.org References External links * Who Are the Remaining Prisoners in Guant√°namo?

Self-described as having been \\"drawing pictures from the first time I could hold a pencil,\\" Norris became art director of The Warrior, the college yearbook, and also performed in plays, served as president of the campus YMCA, and painted signs for businesses. After two years, Norris left college in an aborted attempt to pursue a career as comic strip cartoonist. He recalled in 2006, Norris worked on his grandmother's farm before obtaining a job at an electric-motor assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio.Fremont Tribune (Nebraska) (Feb. 11, 2006): \\"Norris gives new meaning to 'comic book hero'\\", by Tammy Real-McKeighan. He also enrolled at the Dayton Art Institute School, where he met his wife of 61 years, Ann, whom he married in 1939. He went on to become an illustrator and cartoonist for the Dayton Daily News. =Aquaman and Sandman= In 1940, Norris and his wife moved to New York City, New York, where he created the features \\"Power Nelson, Futureman\\", and \\"Yank & Doodle\\" for the comic-book publisher Prize Publications. Historians tentatively identify Norris' comic- book debut as penciling and inking the cover of Prize Publications' Prize Comics #6 (Aug. 1940), with his first confirmed credit the Power Nelson story \\"Introducing Gene West\\" two issues later.Paul Norris at Grand Comics Database Norris' first confirmed credit for DC Comics (then National Comics) is the story \\"The Sandman at Sea\\", starring DC's original Sandman, Wesley Dodds, in Adventure Comics #65 (Aug. 1941). Norris and writer Mort Weisinger revamped that character in superhero attire and introduced sidekick Sandy the Golden Boy in issue #69 (Dec. 1941). Norris and Weisinger introduced the undersea superhero Aquaman in the eight-page story \\"The Submarine Strikes\\" in More Fun Comics # 73 (Nov. 1941). That same year, Norris began drawing the adventure comic strip Vic Jordan for PM, one of the New York's daily afternoon papers. Norris said in 2007 that he had inadvertently signed an exclusive contract with PM and not realized this for a year, after which he had to give up the \\"Aquaman\\" feature. In 1943, King Features Syndicate assigned Norris to write and draw the existing strip Secret Agent X-9, on which he worked for three months before being drafted into the U.S. Army. =World War II= Norris said that during his World War II military service as a tech sergeant, \\"I did a little [comic] strip for the ship newspaper\\" that came to the attention of Lieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. \\"He saw it and made the order that I be transferred from the 82nd Signal Battalion to JIC POA 10th Army\\", where Norris illustrated propaganda leaflets to be dropped from aircraft over Okinawa, urging Japanese soldiers to surrender. \\"I worked with a prisoner of war. We wanted the translations to be authentic\\". Norris in 2006 recalled the POW as George Totari, formerly a reporter for an English language newspaper in Japan. While Norris told one interviewer that, \\"The Japanese came in with these things in their hands and wanted to surrender\\", he told another that the leaflet, designed to look like a comic-book page, had not yet gone into print when the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, scuttling the project. =Brick Bradford and Gold Key= Following the war, Norris was rehired by King Features Syndicate, and in 1948 began drawing the Sunday edition of Austin Briggs' comic strip Jungle Jim. He continued to freelance for DC Comics through 1953, drawing the detective feature \\"Captain Compass\\" in most issues of Star Spangled Comics #106-130 (July 1950 - July 1952), and the super- speedster feature \\"Johnny Quick\\" in Adventure Comics #171-186 (Dec. 1951 - March 1953). In 1952, Norris succeeded artist Clarence Gray on the science- fiction comic strip Brick Bradford, continuing to draw it for 35 years until his and the strip's retirement in 1987. The final daily appeared April 25, 1987. As well in the 1950s, Norris drew issues of Dell Comics' Tom Corbett, Space Cadet and Jungle Jim, the latter of which he had previously drawn as a newspaper comic strip. The following decade, he drew stories of jungle adventurer Tarzan and science-fiction hero Magnus, Robot Fighter in comic books for Gold Key Comics. With writer Gaylord DuBois, Norris co-created the Gold Key jungle characters Kono and Tono in the namesake series The Jungle Twins, which ran 17 original issues (April 1972 - Nov. 1975), followed by reprints. Norris' last known comics story is co-penciling (with Roman Arambula and Scott Shaw) the cover and the 17-page funny animal feature \\"Now You See Them...\\", starring Yogi Bear, Scooby-Doo, and a plethora of other Hanna- Barbera animated TV series characters, in Marvel Comics' Laff-A-Lympics #10 (Dec. 1978). His last comics work was a drawing of Aquaman in DC Comics' multi-artist, multi-character \\"History of the DC Universe\\" poster in 1987. =Later life= Norris was living in Oceanside, California at the time of his death. Norris and his wife Ann, who died in 2000, had two sons, Michael and Paul Jr. (called Reed). Norris is buried in Glen Haven Memorial Gardens in New Carlisle, OH.

He eventually became the manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in partnership with Colley Cibber and, sometime later, Charles Macklin. Family Fleetwood's father was Thomas Fleetwood and his mother was Frances Gerard, whose brother was Charles, the sixth Baron Gerard. He was the couple's only son. He fell heir to a large estate from a relative of his mother's when he was twenty-one years of age but lost most of it gambling. Fleetwood married Susanna Williams (born 1714), a dancer and actress. The couple had two children, Charles and John, who both made stage appearances. Theatre Royal, Drury Lane The last of Fleetwood's inheritance was used to buy the patent for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane from John Highmore in 1734. Highmore had owned half of the patent and Fleetwood paid ¬£2,250 for it; at the same time Fleetwood bought Robert Wilks' share for ¬£1,500 giving him five-sixths of the patent ownership. Charles Macklin was given the role of stage manager as Fleetwood had no experience in theatrical administration. During Fleetwood's tenure at Drury Lane, he introduced a number of reforms including the abolition of the Footman's Gallery. This gallery was provided for the servants and lackeys of the ladies and gentlemen in the audience and generally it was noisy and disorderly. When this gallery was abolished in 1737, riots broke out in the theatre. Fleetwood's interest in the theatre began to recede and by the end of the 1737‚Äì38 season, he resumed his heavy gambling leaving control of the Theatre's finances to the treasurer, Pierson. Fleetwood's management was artistically noteworthy but a financial disaster due to his gambling; profits from the Theatre were used to fund the bets. His most notable achievement at Drury Lane was Macklin's portrayal of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice in 1741; he was also responsible for bringing in David Garrick after his first season at the Goodman's Fields Theatre to perform at Drury Lane in 1742. Financial problems continued to beset Fleetwood and takings at the theatre were insufficient so he mortgaged the patent for the theatre and secured a loan against other paraphernalia at Drury Lane to the bankers Amber and Green. Increases in the price of entry tickets caused brawls to break out during November 1744, which was possibly the trigger for Fleetwood selling the patent to the bankers a few weeks later in December. Payment took the form of a lump sum, either ¬£3,200 or ¬£6,750, plus an annuity. The re-payment of the ¬£5,000 mortgage on the theatre would, however, have been deducted from the lump sum. Death After the sale of the Drury Lane theatre patent, Fleetwood moved to the Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne area in France sometime in the spring of 1745. He died there, seemingly insolvent, in August 1747.

Biography He originally worked as an estate manager near Kyiv and was banished to Siberia for six years of hard labor for his participation in the January Uprising (1863). While there, he began drawing to relieve the monotony. After his return (1869), he enrolled in a drawing class in Warsaw, taught by Wojciech Gerson and sponsored by the Imperial Academy of Arts. During this time, he was awarded two silver medals by the Academy. From 1873 to 1875 he studied art in the studios of Alexander von Wagner in Munich. From 1876 to 1878, he lived in Paris and exhibited at the Salon. For a time, he worked as the head of a studio in Fontainebleau, where he painted porcelain, but he soon resigned and returned to Warsaw, where he established his own studio in 1880. After 1890, he taught drawing at a private school operated by the art pedagogue, Bronis≈Çawa Po≈õwikowa (1855-1902). His artistic inspiration came mainly from peasant life and history. Among his most noted works is a tableau of scenes entitled Goplana, inspired by the play Balladyna by Juliusz S≈Çowacki. He also did a tableau of twelve drawings based on the Polish historical poem Pan Tadeusz, by Adam Mickiewicz. In addition to his painting, he created religious murals and tried his hand at wood carving. His younger brother, Hiacynt, who lived in France, was also a painter.

It is led by Herr Wallenquist, a German- American (though the name is actually Swedish) mobster shrouded in mystery. The organization has a broad base of criminal enterprise to its name, including drug smuggling, contract killing, racketeering, organ harvesting and human trafficking for the purpose of illegal adoption and slavery, as well as having many city officials on their payroll at one time or the other. Leadership Herr Alarich Wallenquist aka the Kraut, is the mysterious and powerful leader of the organization. His goal is merely to achieve power and profit, regardless of what underhanded methods can lead him to that goal. His stature is consistent with his power, as he is portrayed as being an enormous and imposing man who is of greater size and physical bulk than even Marv. Unlike the other antagonists, he acts measured and thoughtful, as he sees revenge as an unnecessary extravagance and will often take losses with a fair amount of dignity when hostile action will serve no practical purpose. In Hell and Back he is more than willing to allow Wallace to leave in his own words \\"And hope to never see them again.\\" In the same book he shows confidence that his organization will be able to bribe Liebowitz to work for them again. He also proves to be one of the few men able to resist Ava Lord's wiles (going so far as to mock her, pointing out that her sexual allure is her only great weapon and that she wields it clumsily, affecting men in ways that do not aid her, such as Mort), and is rarely directly involved with the perpetration of his organization's crimes. In one of his rare appearances, it can be seen that his face and neck is heavily marked with scars or burns. It is rumoured that he may be the mysterious man known only as 'The Janitor' seen executing an escaped Nazi in 'Rats', but this has not been confirmed in-universe. Enforcers The Colonel is an enforcer and captain for Wallenquist. He trains and coordinates assassins in the organisation's employ, as well as being one himself at some point. He runs the organisation's organ harvesting and human trafficking ring as well as other ventures. His operations are eventually shut down by the Basin City Police in a sting operation at the conclusion of the Hell and Back arc; he then is captured and shot by Commissioner Liebowitz for threatening his family. In the movie continuity, it is believed that he was \\"The Salesman\\" from the Sin City short story The Customer is Always Right. This was previously confirmed in the one-shot Sex & Violence when a fan noticed that The Colonel and The Salesman have the same haircut and inquired about it to Frank Miller in the letter section \\"BLAM!\\". Manute, a huge enforcer who dresses like a valet, and acts very gentlemanly in all situations, even while committing homicide. He initially served Ava Lord and, following her death at the hands of Dwight McCarthy, was later recruited by the Colonel and Wallenquist. He is also nigh indestructible, having been crucified (by Miho), shot repeatedly (by Dwight) and savagely beaten numerous times (by Marv and Wallace). The only lasting injury he received was from Marv, who gouged out his right eye. It was later replaced by a fake golden one. Manute was then put in charge of securing the corpse of Jackie-Boy to instigate a war between the police and the girls of Old Town, allowing Wallenquist to make a power grab for Old Town in the meantime; however, he was finally gunned down by the hookers of Old Town during 'The Big Fat Kill'. In the deleted scenes of the movie adaptation, he was shown to have momentarily escaped from the assault with Schutz and another thug, only to be sliced down the middle by Miho in an alleyway moments later. Assassins Delia aka \\"Blue Eyes\\", a trained assassin hired by The Colonel. She uses the powers of seduction to lead unsuspecting men to their deaths. She usually has sex with her victims before killing them. She was unable to seduce Wallace and later calls him a Monk before Maxine drugs him and Gordo pushes the car down a cliff. She herself is killed by Wallace, despite begging for her life. Mariah, a trained assassin in league with Delia, although apparently less skilled. She, too, uses the powers of seduction, but can also fight with a bo (staff). She does manage to seduce and injure Liebowitz's son Josh by breaking his arms. Despite her combat training Wallace easily beats her, breaking her nose in the process. She works for Wallenquist and she managed to escape from Liebowitz's assault on the factory. She was seen later asking to go after Wallace, which she is denied with Wallenquist saying there is no profit in revenge. Has a penchant for leopard print clothing. Gordo, The Colonel's muscle. Works alongside Delia to try and set-up Wallace's death. He serves as the muscle and can push a car and shoot a gun but seemed to barely be able to carry Wallace. He seems to has limited intelligence and speaks in the third person. On a humorous note he once commented Wallace had a big penis. Was killed by Wallace after he mortally shot Captain. Others Bruno, a former hitman and politician on Wallenquist's payroll. His murder at the hands of the Mafia, and the collateral damage that ensued, set Dwight on a mission to find his murderer. Becky, a young Old Town prostitute who is instrumental in getting Jackie Boy killed by Miho. She also works for the Colonel as a spy, mainly because she didn't want her mother to discover that she was a prostitute, partly because he offered her a considerable sum of money and a new life. Killed during 'The Big Fat Kill'. In the epilogue of the movie adaptation, it is implied she is killed by the Salesman while leaving the hospital. Maxine, a psychopharmacologist who works alongside Delia. She administers a strong hallucinogen into Wallace's system, and later gives him the antidote at gunpoint, but she is killed when Wallace accidentally shoots her. She was also involved in Esther's attempted brainwashing. Doctor Fredric, a doctor in league with the Colonel. Kidnaps and overpowers Esther under the Colonel's orders after incapacitating Wallace with narcotics in Hell and Back. Mariah kills him and his companion, Orrin, to make sure that Wallace doesn't extract any valuable information from him. Orrin, Doctor Fredric's assistant and lover. Shoots and incapacitates Wallace with a strong tranquilliser whilst he and Fredric abduct Esther. Mariah kills him before killing Doctor Fredric.

It was established in 1886. It competes in the Eastern Independent League and is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. In late 2007, The Wall Street Journal identified it as one of the world's top 50 schools for its success in preparing students to enter top American universities. In April 2010, it was named one of the top 10 prep schools in America by Forbes. In 2018, Niche ranked it as the best all- girls school in the United States, the 15th best private school in the country, and the 2nd best high school in the Boston area.  History  In 1886, Mary Pickard Winsor started a six-month school in Boston for her aunt's daughter and friends. Winsor, who had been teaching at her mother's school in Winchester, began with eight little girls in a private home on Beacon Hill. She quickly established a viable and growing school for girls, which bore her name, and began sending its graduates to college in 1895. She established the present structure of eight classes, grades 5‚Äì12, offering a ninth, graduate, year (which has since been discontinued). \\"Miss Winsor's School\\" occupied a number of different locations on the Hill until a group of parents asked her to be the director of the school they intended to build. They hoped to secure for children in private schools \\"at least equivalent advantages given to those in the Public Schools, as to fire-proof construction, light, ventilation, and other sanitary arrangements.\\" They formed a corporation in 1907, bought land on the Fenway, and hired the Boston architect R. Clipston Sturgis to build \\"the most perfect schoolhouse.\\" It included a library, science laboratories, art studios, and a gymnasium and swimming tank. The students and alumnae requested that the new school be named for Miss Winsor. President Eliot of Harvard, who was very supportive of the project, suggested the motto \\"A sound mind in a sound body.\\" In 1910, the Winsor School opened with 225 students. Winsor continued as head of the school until 1922. She wanted to prepare women to be self-sufficient and self-supporting, and hoped they would be competent, responsible, and generous-minded. She influenced the growth of her school and showed continued interest in it until her death in 1950.  Academics  Winsor has a reputation for strong academic excellence and has the ideology that its students \\"should be taught to think and learn independently in order to gain the competence and confidence necessary to be lifelong learners and strong, courageous women.\\" In the Upper School, Winsor requires its students to take four years of English classes and a minimum of: three years of a language, three years of mathematics, two and a half years of history, two and a half years of science, two and a half years of arts, seven semesters of physical education, and three semesters of health and wellness. Students must also complete the Global Studies program during one semester of their junior year. Students can take both literature and history courses in either Africa, China, India, the Middle East, or Russia, and these courses culminate in an end-of-semester research paper on a specific regional topic. The school offers many opportunities for its students to engage in STEM fields including electives like engineering design courses that introduce skills such as coding, computer-aided design (CAD), and 3D printing. Winsor offers 12 AP courses.  Arts  Fifth and sixth graders have drama, arts, and theatre classes interwoven into their schedules. In seventh and eighth grades, however, students can take a wide variety of art electives that include sculpture, Shakespeare performance, dance, set design, painting, digital art, and more. In the Upper School, Winsor offers electives in drama, dance, visual art, and music. More specifically, drama courses consist of acting, directing, and theatre tech. Dance electives consist of both group and independent dance. Visual art courses consist of painting, drawing, architecture, printmaking, ceramics, photography, and art history. Music electives consist of chamber orchestra, guitar, percussion, music technology, and piano. Winsor also has a choir called Small Chorus and an all-senior a cappella group called Senior Small. Winsor students frequently put on theatre productions in collaboration with students from the Belmont Hill School and the Roxbury Latin School.  Athletics  Winsor has a range of sports teams on the varsity, junior varsity, and middle school levels. Fall athletic offerings * Cross country * Field hockey * Volleyball * Soccer * Crew Winter athletic offerings * Basketball * Hockey * Squash * Swimming * Curling (Club) Spring athletic offerings * Track * Softball * Crew * Lacrosse * Tennis * Sailing * Golf (club)  Facilities  The school has expanded its facilities over the years, including a turf playing field in 2008, a full gymnasium in the 1920s, a science wing in the 1980s, expanding the library more than once, adding classrooms in the 1990s, reconstructing a new dining hall, classrooms, laboratories, and faculty work space in 2004, and most recently, renovating many classrooms, offices, and corridors. The Winsor Dining Services are My School Dining. They have recently finished building a new addition to the school, costing upwards of $80,000,000. This addition has included a new gym, workout facilities, as well as new music and performing arts facilities. This building is called The Lubin O'Donnell Center for the Performing Arts, Athletics and Wellness.

For a prospective real estate investor, a lower GRM represents a better opportunity. The GRM is useful for comparing and selecting investment properties where depreciation effects, periodic costs (such as property taxes and insurance) and costs to the investor incurred by a potential renter (such as utilities and repairs) can be expected to be uniform across the properties (either as uniform values or uniform fractions of the gross rental income) or insignificant in comparison to gross rental income. As these costs are also often more difficult to predict than market rental return, the GRM serves as an alternative to a measure of net investment return where such a measure would be difficult to determine. Example: $200,000 Sale Price / (750 per month rent * 12 months) = 22.22 Today, it is quite common for GRM to be quoted by real estate professionals using annual rents rather than monthly rents. A 100 GRM (monthly rents) = 8.33 GRM (annual rents). An 8.33 GRM calculated on annual rents suggests the gross rent will pay for the property in 8.33 years. The common measure of rental real estate value based on net return rather than gross rental income is the capitalization rate (or cap rate). In contrast to the GRM, the cap rate is not a multiplier but a rate of annual return. A similar multiplier to the GRM derived from net return would be the multiplicative inverse of the cap rate. Relationship of the cap rate to the total return Another way to value property is with the use of a multiple of gross potential rent, which is arrived at by observing multiples at comparable properties that have sold. This is done with the gross rent multiplier (GRM) or a gross income multiplier (GIM), which are essentially the same. When using these, it is important to know whether they were derived from multiples of gross potential rent or rather effective gross income. Procedures like the above are sometimes called \\"shortcut\\" procedures and they certainly have their place but as causal models of asset value they tend to be at best simplistic and at worst incomplete and sometimes misleading, compared to the more complete multiperiod discounted cash flow (DCF) procedure. For example, even though an example property's value of $18,325,000 may be expressed in terms of, a 5.46 percent cap rate, this does not imply that its value is caused simply by investors' wanting an initial income yield of 5.46 percent. Investors should care about a more complete multiperiod total return perspective on their future investment performance, as represented in the DCF procedure. It is more accurate to think of the longer-term total return total perspective represented by DCF as causing the property value of $18,325,000. The cap rate of 5.46 percent is then best viewed as a reflective representation of the more fundamental DCF calculation.

Garatuza, whose real name was Mart√≠n de Villavicencio Salazar, came to the attention of the authorities in Puebla in 1640 for posing as a priest without having been ordained. He played this role with great pomp, offering his hand to be kissed, hearing confessions, and saying mass. In this way he travelled through much of New Spain, gaining his living fraudulently. In 1642 he was arrested in Nejapa, Oaxaca by the Inquisition, accused of saying mass without being ordained. He managed to escape, but a few months later he turned himself in to the Inquisition in Mexico City. He soon talked his way out of detention, being granted a leave of 40 days to return to Puebla for health reasons. Naturally, he used this opportunity to escape again and continue his escapades. He was apprehended a third time and condemned to appear in an auto de fe \\"as a penitent, with a green candle in his hands, a rope about his neck, a white hood on his head\\". He was to receive 200 lashes and was sentenced to the galleys of Terrenate for five years without pay. The auto de fe was held March 30, 1648 in Mexico City. Thereafter he left New Spain to complete his sentence and was never heard from again. The expression \\"¬øEn qu√© parar√°n estas misas, Garatuza?\\" (What will end these masses, Garatuza?) has passed into the language. It refers to a difficult position a person finds himself in through the consequences of his own actions. The word gartusa (note the variant spelling) has several meanings as a noun. There is a card game of that name. The word can also mean the use of cajolery and flattery to gain one's ends, and it is the name of a feint in fencing. Vicente Riva Palacio (1832‚Äì96) wrote the novel Mart√≠n Gartuza. There is also a Mexican movie based on this novel (1935). In 1986 a Mexican telenovela of the same name was broadcast.

His family settled on a farm near the village of Muirkirk. Barr assisted his father with his job as a carpenter, and developed a sound work ethic. Robert Barr then worked as a steel smelter for a number of years before he was educated at Toronto Normal School in 1873 to train as a teacher. After graduating Toronto Normal School, Barr became a teacher, and eventually headmaster/principal of the Central School of Windsor, Ontario in 1874. While Barr worked as head master of the Central School of Windsor, Ontario, he began to contribute short stories‚Äîoften based on personal experiences, and recorded his work.

In 1876, Barr quit his teaching position to become a staff member of publication, and later on became the news editor for the Detroit Free Press. Barr wrote for this newspaper under the pseudonym, \\"Luke Sharp.\\" The idea for this pseudonym was inspired during his morning commute to work when Barr saw a sign that read \\"Luke Sharp, Undertaker.\\" In 1881, Barr left Canada for England in order to start a new weekly version of \\"The Detroit Free Press Magazine.\\"  London years  Barr (left) with Arthur Conan Doyle (centre) In 1881 Barr decided to \\"vamoose the ranch\\", as he called the process of immigration in search of literary fame outside of Canada, and relocated to London to continue to write/establish the weekly English edition of the Detroit Free Press.Stephen Knight, introduction to The Triumphs of Eug√®ne Valmont. (NY: Oxford University Press, 1997), x.\\"Literature in Canada.\\" The Canadian Magazine, XIV, 1 (November 1899), 3-7. During the 1890s, he broadened his literary works, and started writing novels from the popular crime genre. In 1892 he founded the magazine The Idler, choosing Jerome K. Jerome as his collaborator (wanting, as Jerome said, \\"a popular name\\"). He retired from its co-editorship in 1895. In London of the 1890s Barr became a more prolific author‚Äîpublishing a book a year‚Äîand was familiar with many of the best-selling authors of his day, including :Arnold Bennett, Horatio Gilbert Parker, Joseph Conrad, Bret Harte, Rudyard Kipling, H. Rider Haggard, H. G. Wells, and George Robert Gissing. Barr was well-spoken, well-cultured due to travel, and considered a \\"socializer.\\" Because most of Barr's literary output was of the crime genre, his works were highly in vogue. As Sherlock Holmes stories were becoming well- known, Barr wrote and published in the Idler the first Holmes parody, \\"The Adventures of \\"Sherlaw Kombs\\" (1892), a spoof that was continued a decade later in another Barr story, \\"The Adventure of the Second Swag\\" (1904). Despite those jibes at the growing Holmes phenomenon, Barr remained on very good terms with its creator Arthur Conan Doyle. In Memories and Adventures, a serial memoir published 1923‚Äì24, Doyle described him as \\"a volcanic Anglo‚Äîor rather Scot-American, with a violent manner, a wealth of strong adjectives, and one of the kindest natures underneath it all\\".Knight, x-xi. In 1904, Robert Barr completed an unfinished novel for Methuen & Co. by the recently deceased American author Stephen Crane entitled The O'Ruddy, a romance.The Saturday Evening Post, V. 176, No. 27, January 2, 1904, p. 20. Despite his reservations at taking on the project, Barr reluctantly finished the last eight chapters due to his longstanding friendship with Crane and his common- law wife, Cora, the war correspondent and bordello owner.

At this home, the author died from heart disease on 21 October 1912.The New York Times. 23 October 1912.Who's Who 1914, xxi  Writing Style  Barr's volumes of short stories were often written with an ironic twist in the story with a witty, appealing narrator telling the story. Barr's other works also include numerous fiction and non-fiction contributions to periodicals. A few of his mystery stories and stories of the supernatural were put in anthologies, and a few novels have been republished. His writings have also attracted scholarly attention. His narrative personae also featured moral and editorial interpolations within their tales. Barr's achievements were recognized by an honorary degree from the University of Michigan in 1900. His protagonists were journalists, princes, detectives, deserving commercial and social climbers, financiers, the new woman of bright wit and aggressive accomplishment, and lords. Often, his characters were stereotypical and romanticized. Barr wrote fiction in an episode-like format. He developed this style when working as an editor for the newspaper Detroit Press. Barr developed his skill with the anecdote and vignette; often only the central character serves to link the nearly self-contained chapters of the novels.

Photo courtesy of the Virginia Commonwealth University Libraries Thousands of small Southern Baptist churches dotted the landscape throughout the United States in the mid-19th century. Recognizing that many churches working together in missions could accomplish more than any one, the Board of Foreign Missions was established on May 10, 1845 (the same date the Southern Baptist Convention was formed) and headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, USA. George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 1206Created as a sending organization funded through the cooperative efforts of SBC churches, they chose China as their first mission field and on September 1, 1845 the board appointed their first missionaries, Samuel C. Clopton and George Pearcy. Bill J. Leonard, Baptists in America, Columbia University Press, USA, 2005, p. 100 In January 1849 the board began The Commission magazine to keep constituents informed of the mission work being carried out. Monthly circulation of the periodical reached 7,000 by April 1850 and is currently an online magazine, although there is an occasional print issue. Their first publication, Southern Baptist Missionary Journal is defunct. Lottie Moon On July 7, 1873 the board appointed its most famous missionary, Charlotte D. \\"Lottie\\" Moon, to China. Lottie served many years among the Chinese and after giving her life to foreign missions.

Tucker, From Jerusalem to Irian Jaya: A Biographical History of Christian Missions, Zondervan, USA, 2011, p. 298By December 1950 the Board had appointed a record-breaking 111 missionaries in that year alone. In July 1964 the Board began a new effort to send single missionaries called the Journeyman Program. Today the Journeyman Program sends out hundreds of college-educated singles and married couples under 27 years of age each year for two-year terms throughout the world. In February 1989 the International Service Corps program was introduced to facilitate short-term missions for projects lasting from 4 to 24 months with a possible 12-month extension. The Foreign Mission Board celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1995 and in 2001 exceeded 5,000 missionaries on the field for the first time. In 1997 the Foreign Mission Board voted to change its name to the International Mission Board which it is known by today. Lamin O. Sanneh, Joel A.

Baptist mission board squelches criticism  Deseret News (Salt Lake City)  Find Articles at BNET.com In 2018, author Anne Marie Miller publicly disclosed in a report by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram how the IMB covered up abuse by one of their missionaries, Mark Edwin Aderholt. Miller disclosed the abuse to the IMB in 2007 and they determined it was \\"more likely than not\\" that Aderholt sexually abused Miller when she was a minor. They allowed Aderholt to resign and did not inform future employers of this accusation. Miller reported the abuse to authorities in early 2018 and Aderholt was arrested in July 2018 and indicted on four felony sex crimes in December 2018. Shortly after his arrest, the IMB apologized and initiated an external examination of Miller's case and all other sexual abuse cases. On June 2, 2019, the Houston Chronicle uncovered a pattern of abuse covered up by the IMB. The third party examination by Minnesota firm Gray Plant Mooty revealed serious faults with IMB's \\"zero tolerance\\" sexual abuse policy. Gray Plant Mooty \\"identified a number of significant concerns with IMB‚Äôs handling of past cases\\" and that the \\"IMB‚Äôs current policies and procedures fall short of contemporary best practice standards.\\" The IMB issued a statement saying they are implementing the recommendations of Gray Plant Mooty, though at the 2019 Southern Baptist Church Annual Convention, new president Paul Chitwood did not mention the report or findings, and a motion made by former IMB trustee Wade Burleson to make the report public was denied by legal counsel saying it was \\"out of order.\\" See also * American Southern Baptist Mission * List of American Southern Baptist missionaries in China * North American Mission Board Notes External links * Official website of the International Mission Board * The Commission magazine Category:Southern Baptist Convention Category:Religious organizations established in 1845 Category:Baptist organizations established in the 19th century Category:Baptist missionary societies Category:1845 establishments in the United States ","title":"International Mission Board"},{"id":"4827231","text":"This is a list of all United States Supreme Court cases from volume 17 of the United States Reports: External links Category:1819 in United States case law ","title":"List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 17"},{"id":"4827238","title":"Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915"},{"id":"4827239","text":"The Armstrong Whitworth Ensign was a British four-engine airliner built during the late 1930s for Imperial Airways. It could seat 40 passengers and was designed for European and Asian routes, connecting Britain with further seaplane flights to Australia and South Africa. In the Second World War, they were used for transport duties to and from the area of Middle East command. After the war, they were withdrawn from service and ‚Äì with no buyers forthcoming ‚Äì scrapped. Design and development Prototype G-ADSR in flight Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft started on the A.W.27 Ensign in 1934 after receipt of a specification from Imperial Airways for a monoplane airliner with four Armstrong Siddeley Tiger engines. Government policy was to send all first-class mail by air and Imperial Airways were increasing their fleet. The first aircraft was ordered in September for a cost of ¬£27,000 (design) and ¬£43,300 (manufacture) of that year, with delivery expected in 1936. Eleven more (at ¬£37,000 each) were ordered in May 1935.\\"Armstrong Whitworth A.W.27 Ensign.\\" Imperial Airways, 20 April 2006. Retrieved: 31 January 2011. An order for a further two aircraft (¬£40,000 each) in December 1936 brought the total to 14.Flight 1957 p. 203 The Ensign was a high-wing cantilever monoplane of light alloy construction and an oval, semi-monocoque fuselage with a conventional tailplane. The wings aft of the single box spar were fabric covered as was the tailplane and fin. It had retractable landing gear and a castoring tail wheel. The main landing gear was hydraulically operated and retracted into the inner engine nacelles. The cockpit had side-by-side seating for two pilots with dual controls; there was also accommodation for a radio operator. The fuselage was divided into separate cabins, either four cabins with accommodation for 40 passengers or three cabins with room for 27 by day or 20 at night with sleeping accommodation. Production of their Whitley heavy bomber for the Royal Air Force was a priority, and work on the Ensign proceeded slowly. Construction took place not at the main Coventry factory, but at the production line of Air Service Training Ltd (another member of the Hawker-Siddeley group) in Hamble. Constant changes were requested by Imperial, slowing production further. As a result, the Ensign's maiden flight did not take place until 24 January 1938 with Charles Turner-Hughes at the controls assisted by Eric Greenwood. The first flight showed a problem with applying full rudder that was cured by modifying the servo. On the second, the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. The prototype then went on for more exhaustive tests before passing to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) for Air Ministry testing. On her fourth flight, the engines cut out due to incorrect settings of the fuel cocks and it had to be glided down to RAF Bicester where it made a perfect \\"dead-stick\\" landing. Imperial Airways named the prototype \\"Ensign\\" and as such the \\"Ensign Class\\" was applied to the whole fleet. The aircraft were fitted out for either Empire routes (eight aircraft) or European routes (four aircraft). The former carried 27 passengers in three cabins or 20 sleeping; the latter 40 passengers across three cabins and a four-person \\"coupe\\" aft of the third cabin. The only difference in crewing was a \\"flight clerk\\" replacing one of the two stewards on Empire routes.Flight 1957 p. 204 Despite its Tiger engines making it underpowered, the aircraft was certified, and full airline service began between Croydon Airport and Paris, France in October of that year. Operational history Armstrong-Whitworth A.W.27 Ensign Three more Ensigns ‚Äì G-ADSS Egeria, G-ADST Elsinore and G-ADSU Euterpe ‚Äì were completed by Christmas 1938, and were dispatched to Australia with the holiday mail. All three suffered mechanical problems and did not reach their destination; consequently, all five Ensigns were removed from active airline service and returned to Armstrong for improvements. Reliability was improved, and more powerful (935 hp) Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IXC engines aided performance somewhat. The aircraft were delivered back to the airline, starting in June 1939, along with the sixth to be built. The plan to use four Ensigns with Indian Trans-Continental Airways, operating from Calcutta, did not come to pass, due to the modifications and the onset of war, although registrations and new names had been made and, in one case, painted on the aircraft. 11 aircraft were in service at the outbreak of the Second World War, with a twelfth following soon after. All were withdrawn in October 1939; they were to be camouflaged before flying a new route from Heston Aerodrome to Le Bourget Airport, Paris. The aircraft remained in service after formation of BOAC that November, but instead of being taken up for military service, remained civilian under direction of National Air Communications. Their first duties after the German invasion of the Low Countries was ferrying supplies to France. This was followed by evacuation before France capitulated in June. Despite operating away from their maintenance base for weeks at a time, Ensigns managed 100% availability and impressed folk with their short take-off run, even when fully loaded. Three Ensigns were destroyed by enemy action in 1940: G-ADSX Ettrick and G-ADSZ Elysian in France, and G-ADTC Endymion at Bristol Whitchurch in November 1940. Ettrick, which had been abandoned at Le Bourget after being damaged by bombs on 1 June 1940, was rumoured to have been used by Germany, and later given Daimler-Benz engines. This is considered by most experts on the Luftwaffe to be a myth which may have its roots in a Flight article by P.W. Moss in 1957.Moss, P.W. Flight (1957) p. 206. Flight (1957) p. 247 However, the Database section in the March 2015 edition of Aeroplane Monthly states that the Germans may have fitted Daimler-Benz engines to G-AFZV Enterprise.Aeroplane March 2015 p. 94 As the aircraft were found to be lacking in performance for their wartime role, it was decided to give the remaining eight aircraft Wright Cyclone G.102A engines. The final two aircraft that had been ordered by Imperial in 1936, were equipped with more powerful Wright Cyclone geared radial engines and completed as A.W.27A Ensign Mk IIs.Moss identifies the AW.27A as a \\"rail-launching project to Specification 13/38\\" The new engines significantly improved performance and allowed the Ensign to be used in hot climates and at high altitude. At the same time, other modifications were incorporated and the prototype Mark II, G-AFZU Everest first flew in June 1941, with G-AFZV Enterprise following at the end of October. All eight surviving airframes were upgraded with these newer engines in 1941‚Äì43, as they were completed they were transferred to the Middle East and worked for BOAC on Africa to India routes. Ensigns flew throughout the war. On a ferry flight to west Africa, following engine trouble, Enterprise made a forced landing in the desert in French West Africa (at that point under Vichy France control) about 300 miles short of their destination. Codebooks and other paperwork on board were destroyed, except for that required to show that the crew were civilian. They were picked up by an RAF Sunderland flying boat and taken on to Bathurst in Gambia. Enterprise was found by the French authorities, repaired and used as a hospital plane at Dakar before being flown to Vichy France. (During service with the French, Enterprise was initially registered as F-AFZV, later becoming F-BAHD). After the German occupation of Vichy France, it was taken by the German Air Ministry and tested, before being used as transport for officers.Flight (1957) p. 249 It was scrapped in Toulouse in 1943. Of those left in service, several were broken up for spare parts to support the remaining fleet. From 1944, towards the end of their service, the Ensigns were used between Cairo and Calcutta. When taken out of use for their Certificate of Airworthiness overhauls, the camouflage dope, which, in combination with the heat, had been rotting the fabric surfaces, was removed and thereafter the Ensigns were in a \\"natural\\" finish. After the end of the war, in part, due to their performance and the problematic maintenance of the fabric surfaces, it was decided, eventually, to remove the Ensigns from service and to return them to the UK. Euterpe, which had been out of use since February 1945, was sacrificed to make repairs to the others.Flight 1957 p. 249 The final Ensign passenger flight took place in June 1946 when G-ADSW Eddystone flew from Cairo to Hurn via Marseille, having been delayed in the Middle East by repairs. Conversion of the Ensigns was considered and they were offered for sale, but the projected costs were too much for those who showed interest. The aircraft were broken up at Hamble in March and April 1947 and removed to Cowley, Oxford where they were reduced to scrap.Flight 1957 p. 250 Accidents and incidents * On 15 December 1939, G-ADSU Euterpe was damaged in a forced landing at Bonnington, Warwickshire. \\\\- See Talk page. * In December 1939, G-ADSU Euterpe overran the runway at RAF Chipping Warden and wrecked its undercarriage. Unlikely - See Talk page * On 23 May 1940, G-ADSZ Elysean was attacked by three Messerschmitt Me 109 aircraft of the Luftwaffe whilst on the ground at Merville, Nord, France and was burnt out. * On 23 May 1940, G-ADTA Euryalus crash-landed at RAF Lympne, Kent and was damaged. The aircraft was one of six that escaped after a Luftwaffe raid on Merville Airfield. The intended destination was Croydon. Approaching the English coast, first, she lost her port inner engine and the pilot set course for RAF Hawkinge. A short time later, her starboard inner engine also had to be shut down. The pilot changed course for Lympne. On landing, the starboard undercarriage was not fully down, causing the wing to scrape the ground and the aircraft to go through a fence as no braking was attempted. Euryalus was flown to RAF Hamble in June, but it was decided to cannibalise her to repair G-ADSU Euterpe which had been damaged in an accident at RAF Chipping Warden in December 1939. Euryalus was officially written off on 15 November 1941 and scrapped in September 1942.Flight (1957) p. 203.Moss, P.W. \\"Ensign Class.\\" Flight, 1957 p. 204.Flight, 1957 p. 205 * On 1 June 1940, G-ADSX Ettrick was abandoned at Le Bourget Airport, Paris, France due to the runway being strewn with time-delay bombs. * On 9 November 1941, G-AFZU Everest was attacked by a Heinkel He 111 aircraft of the Luftwaffe over the Bay of Biscay. A safe landing was made at RAF Portreath, Cornwall. The aircraft was later repaired and returned to service. * On 1 February 1942, G-AFZV Enterprise made a forced landing from the coast of French West Africa due to problems with both port engines. The crew were rescued by a Short Sunderland of No. 204 Squadron RAF. The aircraft was later salvaged by the French and registered F-AFZV. It was later re-registered F-BAHD and entered service with Air France.Then captured by the Germans in November 1942 and re- engined with Daimler-Benz engines.

Anthony Megale (August 1, 1953 ‚Äì July 21, 2015), also known as \\"The Genius\\", \\"Tony Connecticut\\", \\"Machiavelli\\", \\"Mac\\", \\"The Brain\\", \\"Mr. T\\", and \\"Gas Man\\" was a Connecticut mobster who became the acting underboss of the Gambino crime family. Criminal history Born in Italy, Megale moved to Connecticut as a young man. Megale's residence was in Stamford, Connecticut. He married with a son and two daughters. At some point, Megale joined the Gambino family. In 1982, Megale was convicted of a narcotics offense. In 1990, Megale pleaded guilty to racketeering and was sentenced to six years in prison. Megale's plea deal included an admission that he belonged to a La Cosa Nostra family, which infuriated Gambino boss John Gotti. In 1995, Megale was released from prison on parole. However, in 1998 he returned to prison for 11 months for associating with other criminals, a parole violation. In August 2001, Megale became a caporegime in the Gambino family for its Connecticut operations. In 2002, Megale became acting underboss after Peter Gotti's arrest on racketeering charges. A resident of North Stamford, Connecticut, Megale was associated with a garbage-carting operation in that state. Megale died in July, 2015, just 8 months after being released from prison, in December 2014. Extortion victims In August 2002, Megale met with Harry Farrington, aka \\"Oil Can Harry\\" the owner of two strip clubs in Fairfield County, Connecticut who was being extorted by mobsters from the Patriarca crime family of New England. Megale contacted the Patriarca mobsters and told them that Stamford was his territory and then proceeded to extort Farrington himself. In September 2002, Megale told Farrington that he would have to pay Megale $2,000 a month in \\"protection\\" money plus a yearly $3,000 \\"Christmas bonus.\\" If the payments were late, Megale threatened Farrington with violence and property destruction. Farrington's response was to go to law enforcement, which set Farrington up with a listening device for future meetings with Megale. Between November 2002 and February 2004, Farrington made regular payments to Megale while recording their meetings. In September 2002, Megale started extorting $200 a month from a vending machine operator who already been making payments to the Gambino family since 1996. During this period, Megale also extorted money from a construction company in Westchester County, New York and a New Jersey trucking company. Connecticut and New York convictions In September 2004, with evidence from Farrington, Megale was indicted in Connecticut on 38 extortion charges. In October 2005, Megale pleaded guilty to lesser charges and on April 3, 2006, was sentenced to 86 months in prison. On March 31, 2006, Megale pleaded guilty to reduced charges in the New York case. On September 6, 2006, Megale was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. Farrington sold his two clubs and moved out of state. Megale served his sentence at the Allenwood Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. On December 1, 2014, he was released from prison. Megale died on July 21, 2015 at Stamford Hospital after suffering a heart attack.

The recent completion of a bypass for the village on the A930 road from Dundee to Carnoustie is something that was originally planned before the Second World War. There is a water mill (Barry Mill) operated by the National Trust for Scotland. The village is served by Barry Links railway station. The village was formerly served by Barry primary school which closed in 2007. History Barry Mill The Parish of Barry, which was originally known as Fethmoreth, Fethmure, Fettermore or Fethmuref was originally bestowed to the monks of Balmerino Abbey in Fife by Alexander II in 1230. An early record of it can be found in a proverb attributed to Thomas the Rhymer: ::The braes of Fettermore ::Hae been a gude ship's shore The monks originally managed the lands from the Grange of Barry and latterly the land was controlled by the office of the Bailies of Barry, an early holder of this position being Sir Thomas Maule of Panmure in 1511. A number of feus were granted in the Parish around that time, including Ravensby in 1539, Gedhall to David Gardyne in 1541, half of Barry Links and Cowbyres to Walter Cant in 1545 and the other half of the links to Robert Forrester in 1552. Old house in Barry The land was annexed by the crown in the Protestant reformation following an Act of Parliament in 1587 and the Bailiery of Barry was granted by James VI as a heritable gift to Patrick Maule in 1590. Ownership of the lands was granted by the King to James Elphinstone, Secretary of State in 1599 (ratified 1605), and was sold to George Maule, 2nd Earl of Panmure in 1667 (ratified in 1672) for ¬£746 13s 4d. The land was forfeited following James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure's involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1715.

The idea originated in the fact that the German satellite ASTRO-SPAS (see STS-80) had recorded many hours of video footage in space. The BR received this footage, edited the material and added downtempo spherical music. As BR did not want to show the same pictures 7 days a week, both NASA and ESA as well as the German Aerospace Center were addressed. They offered more hours of footage from in and around space, which were thus included. Cult status and music The broadcast quickly turned into a cult: At raves in the mid-90s it wasn't unusual to show the images of Space Night on big TV-screens. Early in the morning after the rave it was often used to calm down, especially from 1996 and later, as Space Night's sound changed through the musical guidance by Alex Azary (a European chill-out-DJ), who provided a more electronic background music. This was a logical step that originated from Alex Azary. He headed the Club XS in Frankfurt where \\"chill out nights\\" started in 1990, supported by spherical music. Alongside, pictures of Space Night were shown, albeit the playback was a little bit slower than in the original program. The images did fit well to the then new music-genre and Alex thought it would be a good idea to show it to the people at BR. A meeting in Munich followed where he could convince them to try something new. The compositions are also available as separate CDs, the mixdown starting from the album \\"Space Night II\\" is done by the German music label Elektrolux. In the meantime, twelve CD-albums with music to the television series have been published, with three of those clearly differing in musical style. While \\"Space Night Vol. 1\\" is an album featuring pop music, \\"Space Night Vol. 10\\" features Jazz music and \\"Space Night Vol. 12\\" is a double CD with classical music. A DVD titled \\"Best of Earth-Views\\" is also available.  Problems  After a change in tariffs by the GEMA, BR stated they would not want to continue Space Night starting in January 2013, due to the drastically increased royalties. Hence the series was ended on January 8, 2013. Numerous viewers engaged BR to continue Space Night by using GEMA-free music. The station decided to undo the cancellation, first by rerunning older episodes starting on February 25, 2013 and to later broadcast new episodes starting in autumn of 2013. To accomplish this, BR will use music with Creative Commons licensing, encouraging their viewer to upload their favorites. The restart was scheduled for November 1, 2013. It had to be postponed to November, 15th, because NASA was not able to provide the necessary graphical material, due to the Government shutdown in the United States. Special broadcasts =Moon landing= Since the 25th anniversary of the first human landing on the moon the original version of the broadcast of the ARD is shown at the exact time of the original airing. =Perry Rhodan= At the 40th anniversary of the Perry Rhodan series in 2001 there was a 'Perry Rhodan-Space Night'. Cover art by the artist Johnny Bruck (who produced the cover artwork for Perry Rhodan) was shown with modern techniques to animate still pictures, there were galaxies, planets, spaceplanes, men and aliens - a visual journey through the Perry Rhodan universe with the known music of Space Night. Following the broadcast, which was repeated for several weeks, a DVD with the title space night presents: Perry Rhodan 40th Anniversary - Special Sci-Fi Edition and a double album with the music was created.

Chia is identified in the novels as \\"The most dangerous woman in the history of man\\". The term \\"Chinese Gothic\\" was coined to describe the world of Chia Black Dragon. Character overview Chia menaced in 19th century London docklandsChia miffed in 19th century docklands Chia is a part-human, part-demon Chinese woman. She was born on the shores of north China in the 3rd millennium BC. Her mother, Chi, was human but her father, Glak, was the last of a monstrous prehuman race who possessed the capacity for \\"infinite flesh\\", i.e. the ability to transform into a bewildering variety of Lovecraftian metamorphoses. This ability has passed on to Chia in the modified form of \\"wild flesh\\" which rejuvenates her every few years, with the result that she ages about three years in every thousand (after having aged normally up to her twelfth year). In the months leading up to her wild flesh rejuvenations she becomes increasingly deranged and dangerous. At the time of the first Chia novel, Spirit Mirror, she is twenty years old in appearance but almost three thousand years old chronologically. Chia, whose name means Twilight in a pre-Chinese language, and who later gained the title \\"Black Dragon\\" from her valley-home on Black Dragon Mountain, is very much a dark and light character, her spirit blighted in infancy by her father whom she later kills with the aid of her twin brother, Nyak. She and Nyak soon take different paths, Chia struggling (and constantly failing) to become fully human, Nyak aspiring to inherit the full powers of his father. As the centuries progress the twins become the bitterest of enemies. Chia Black Dragon was brought up as a cannibal and psychic vampire by her father, and although she rejected the cannibalistic rituals of her childhood she still reverts to vampirism at times throughout her life, sometimes by choice. She never does quests but is spurred into action only by the desire to help a close friend or (more usually) destroy an enemy. Chia's lesbian nature is clearly stated in the novels but, with the exception of a scene in Shadow Sisters, there are no outright sexual encounters. Although the Chia series definitely belongs in the darkest of the dark fantasy genre, the stories, and Chia herself, abound in quirky black humour that counterbalances the frequent eruptions of horror and violence. Chia is, for example, deliberately written as an anachronistic character, in speech and also in appearance (she strolls around ancient China and Rome in a modern black overcoat and wears sunglasses - both of her own design). She is, essentially, a modern character set in the past. Despite her daunting history as a former cannibal, sometime vampire, assassin etc., Chia nevertheless comes across as vulnerable as well as formidable. Self-loathing is a permanent feature of her personality. The other characters in the stories rarely see Chia's vulnerable side but the reader is frequently afforded an insight into her self-doubt and fears even as she is putting on an arrogant front to those around her. To date, there are three Chia Black Dragon novels and also a planned Chia video game, Shadow. Two examples of artist David Hitchcock's concept artwork for Shadow, copyright Creative Reality Software and Stephen Marley, are included here. Set in 1889, they show Chia immediately before and during an ambush by her brother's henchmen.  Novels  Spirit Mirror: publisher HarperCollins (1988) Set in 2nd-century China at the end of the Han dynasty, this is the first and least typical of the Chia books. Spirit Mirror tells the story of a mirror haunting orchestrated by her twin brother, Nyak. Atmospheric, but rather too richly written, it recounts Chia's struggle against an insidious haunting spread through any reflective surface and her gradual realisation that her brother is behind the spreading evil. She discovers that Nyak's aim is to destroy the newly established religion of Buddhism in China. However, as in all the novels, Chia's own actions (in this case predicted by Nyak) almost bring about the very disaster she intends to avert. Although not as unconventional as the following novels, the narrative still features a great deal of the graphic violence, horror and mystical passages that characterise the later works, although the dark comedy elements are less in evidence here. Mortal Mask: publisher Random House (1991) Chia comes into her own in this tale of Nyak's resurrection in a sinister mansion in Silver Music Bay. It is in this book, the first full-fledged example of \\"Chinese Gothic\\", that Chia dons her anachronistic attire and launches full flood into modernistic dialogue. Set a few years after the conclusion of Spirit Mirror, the story of Mortal Mask starts with a wild ride of a prologue in which Nyak's devastated spirit, after a titanic battle with Chia, flies east to Silver Music Bay. Some time later, Chia begins to suspect that her brother may have survived what she had hoped was their final battle after Nyak's deadly servants, the Silver Brethren, invade her home on Black Dragon Mountain. She travels to a Taoist hermitage in Silver Music Bay and meets and falls in love with Xanthippe, an orphaned Nubian girl who accompanied her parents on their journey from Egypt. Prior to Chia's arrival, all manner of insidious hauntings have afflicted the hermitage and the surrounding coastline, and with Chia on the scene matters take a turn from bad to worse. Chia eventually tracks the source of the haunting to a mansion known as the House of Heaven, which she discovers is the location of her birth and infancy. She also realises the full extent of her father's evil nature and of Nyak's impending resurrection. Mortal Mask, which was acclaimed a 'masterpiece' in the Clute/Grant The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, is essentially a deeply layered ghost story that plays out a host of metaphysical themes in a narrative that drives Chia relentlessly to the edge of damnation and an impending apocalypse. Shadow Sisters: publisher Random House (1993) This is a full-scale epic, ranging from 7th-century Rome to China at the fall of the Sui dynasty. Chia has turned the Catholic Church upside down in her desperate (and insane) attempt to make herself pope in place of Pope Adeodatus I. Betrayed by one of her \\"disciples\\", Wittigis, she is forced to flee Rome and return to China after a centuries-long absence. Wittigis, self-renamed Crucifer, leads Chia's former disciples in a purportedly religious mission to China to destroy her, their quest motivated in reality by dark desires that none of the disciples care to admit. In China, Chia forms an intimate attachment to Nua, a young woman who belongs to a sort of all-female Chia fan club in which the members dress and try to act like their idol. Chia, at Nua's urging, agrees to assassinate the emperor, Yang Ti, to make way for the first emperor of the Tang dynasty. After encountering the sole disaffected member of Crucifer's followers, a man renamed Judas, Chia and Nua head for Yang Ti's southern capital of Chiang-tu (modern Yang-chou). It is in Chiang-tu that Chia discovers that Crucifer and his disciples have been transformed into non-human entities by a buried power in Shadow Hill (the site of the Buddhist monastery in Spirit Mirror) and have drawn Yang Ti and his court into an alternative and terrifying reality which threatens to absorb the world. The story reaches its climax as Chia shifts between realities and confronts an old, but unexpected, enemy.  Video game  There is a Chia video game planned with Creative Reality Software, designed by Stephen Marley and provisionally titled Shadow. A companion novel to the game is expected.

Early life Williamson, born in Chicago, to parents George Williamson and Bernice Hunt, was mystically inclined as a teenager, but transferred some of his occult enthusiasm to flying saucers in the late 1940s. He was a student of archaeology at least as early as 1946 when he recorded a site in southern Illinois.Williamson, George Hunt, \\"A Newly Discovered Village Site in Southern Illinois\\" Illinois State Archaeological Society Journal 4(4):22-25, 1947 By 1949, he was a student of anthropology at the University of Arizona and did archaeological fieldwork in Lincoln County, New Mexico.Williamson, George Hunt, \\"Archaeological Investigations along the Rio Bonito, Lincoln County, New Mexico (Preliminary Report on Rio Bonito Cave I), Arizona State Museum, Tucson, 1949 In October 1949, he helped found the Yavapai County Archaeological Society in Prescott, Arizona where he lived until at least 1955. Although he apparently did not remain active long, this society was the foundation of an archaeological group that is still active.Christenson, Andrew L., An Essential Relationship: Amateurs and Professionals in Central Arizona Archaeology. Smoki Museum of American Indian Art & Culture, Prescott, 2014, p. 49-50 Based upon fieldwork in northern Mexico, he published an article on fiestas.Williamson, George H., \\"Why the Pilgrims Come\\" The Kiva 16(1-2):2-8, 1950 Although details are uncertain, he was expelled from the university on academic grounds in early 1951 and does not appear to have ever gotten a college degree, although he did put \\"Dr.\\" in front of his name.Hidel, Alec \\"George Hunt Williamson & the Genesis of the Contactees\\" www.ufomind.com/misc/1997/mar/d21-002.shtml Career Having read William Dudley Pelley's book Star Guests (1950), Williamson worked for a while for Pelley's cult organization, helping to put out its monthly publication Valor. (As a matter of fact, Williamson did not know either the man or his work BEFORE August 1953‚Ä¶. well AFTER the events of November 20, 1952, related in Flying Saucers Have Landed‚Ä¶ and he worked for Pelley in 1954‚Ä¶ See Zirger & Martinelli, The Incredible Life of George Hunt Williamson, p. 101). Pelley had generated huge quantities of communications with \\"advanced intelligences\\" via automatic writing, and very clearly was an immediate inspiration to Williamson, who combined his fascination with the occult and with flying saucers by trying to contact flying saucer crews with a home-made Ouija board. After hearing about the flying-saucer-based religious cult of George Adamski, perhaps through Pelley,in contradiction with Williamson's own statements, see Zirger & Martinelli, pp. 100-103 and 159 Williamson and his wife, and fellow saucer believers Alfred and Betty Bailey, became regular visitors to Adamski's commune at Palomar Gardens and eventually members of Adamski's Theosophy- spinoff cult. They witnessed Adamski \\"telepathically\\" channelling and tape- recording messages from the friendly humanoid Space Brothers who inhabited every solar planet.this is an unsubstantiated rumor contradicted by Williamson's own statement, see Zirger & Martinelli, p. 182 The Williamsons, the Baileys and two other Adamski disciples became the \\"witnesses\\" to Adamski's supposed meeting with Orthon, a handsome blond man from Venus, near Desert Center, California on November 20, 1952. In fact the \\"witnesses\\" experienced nothing more than Adamski telling them to wait and stay put while he walked over a hill,(absolutely false, and does not take into account Williamson's own tape-recorded statements on that matter, see Zirger & Martinelli, p. 65-66) then came back into view an hour later, with a preliminary story of his experiences - a story subsequently greatly changed for book publication in Flying Saucers Have Landed (1953), as Williamson himself later pointed out.absolutely false, contradicts Williamson's own reiterated tape-recorded statements, see Zirger & Martinelli, p. 65 The initial publication of Adamski's tale in an Arizona newspaper on November 24, 1952, triggered an explosive growth in the membership of Adamski's cult. The Williamsons and Baileys continued their Ouija-board sessions, getting their own personal revelations from the Space Brothers, which led to a drastic falling-out with Adamski. In 1954, Williamson and Bailey published The Saucers Speak which emphasized supposed short-wave radio communications with friendly saucer pilots, but in fact depended for almost all its contents on the Ouija board sessions Bailey and Williamson held regularly from 1952 onward. They heard from Actar of Mercury, Adu of Hatonn in Andromeda, Agfa Affa from Uranus,presumably not the same Affa who was the exclusive contact of Frances Swan Ankar-22 of Jupiter, Artok of Pluto, Awa from Outer Space, Garr from Pluto, Kadar Lacu from Saturn, Karas the Space Brother, Lomec of Venus, Nah-9 from Neptune, Noro of the Saucer Fleet, Oara of Saturn, Ponnar of Hatoon (presumably not the same Ponnar who was the exclusive contact of Frances Swan), Regga of Mars, Ro of Torresoton, Sedat of Hatonn, Suttku of Saturn, Terra of Venus, Wan-4 of the Safanian planets, Zago of Mars and Zo of Neptune. The \\"board\\" contacts were in good if uninformative English, but the few reported radio contacts, in International Morse code, left a little to be desired. Sample: \\"AFFA FROM THE P. RA RRR OK K5 K5 FROM THE PLA CHANT RRT IT.\\" Perhaps influenced by the Shaver Mystery, Williamson also reveals that while most space aliens are helpful and good, there are some very bad ones hanging out near Orion and headed for earth in force, bent on conquest. Williamson became a more obscure competitor to Adamski, eventually combining his own channelling and the beliefs of a small contactee cult known as the Brotherhood of the Seven Rays, led by Marion Dorothy Martin, to produce a series of books about the secret, ancient history of mankind: Other Tongues‚ÄîOther Flesh (1957), Secret Places of the Lion (1958), UFOs Confidential with John McCoy (1958), Road in the Sky (1959) and Secret of the Andes (1961). These books, when not rewriting the Old and New Testaments to depict every important person as a reincarnation of one of only six or eight different \\"entities,\\" expanded on the usual late 19th Century Theosophical teachings borrowed without credit from Thomas Lake Harris that friendly Space Brothers in the distant past had taught the human race the rudiments of civilization and, according to Williamson, spacemen had also helped materially in the founding of the Jewish and Christian religions, impersonating \\"gods\\" and providing \\"miracles\\" when needed. Williamson spiced his books with additional Ouija-revelations to the effect that some South, Central and North American ancient civilizations actually began as colonies of human-appearing extraterrestrials. Williamson can be considered a more mystically-inclined forerunner of Erich von D√§niken; Secret Places of the Lion also displays the clear and explicit influence of Immanuel Velikovsky. Like his role-model Adamski, Williamson enjoyed referring to himself as \\"professor,\\" and claimed an extensive academic background, which in fact was completely non-existent. In the late 1950s he withdrew from the contactee scene and even changed his name, concocting a new fictitious academic and family background to go along with the new name, while continuing to live in California. His 1961 book was published under a still different pen name. Little is known about his life between 1961 and his reported death in 1986, other than that at one time he became a priest of the Nestorian Church, actually the Assyrian Church of the East. As of 2006, a number of his books are still in print, in paperback editions. The only other well-known 1950s contactees who still have books in print are Daniel Fry and Truman Bethurum.

In 1859, he was the first elected (provisional) governor of the newly proposed Nevada Territory.  Early life  Roop was born in Carroll County, Maryland. Career In 1851 William Nobles (guide) started taking settlers over a route through the Sierra Nevada passing through the Honey Lake valley; included among these settlers were the 29-year-old Isaac Roop and his family. His first three years in California were spent in Shasta County, in farming and trading. During this period he also held the positions of Postmaster and School Commissioner. He had accumulated in that time upwards of fifteen thousand dollars' worth of property, but in June 1853, lost it all by fire. It was then that Roop retreated to the Sierra Nevada and to Honey Lake, where he concentrated on his own backcountry holdings and nearly single-handedly erected the burg of Rooptown which he would later name for his daughter Susan. In September 1859, Roop was elected the first territorial governor of the proposed Nevada Territory. At the time, Susanville was thought to be in Nevada instead of California. The new provisional government first convened on December 15, 1859, in the town of Genoa. Roop lived in the contested County of Roop. He was elected in 1861 to the new Nevada Territorial Senate. After the county's dissolution in 1865, Roop returned to Susanville, California. Roop became Lassen County's district attorney for two terms.  Personal life  On December 24, 1840, Roop married Nancy Gardner, his tutor. They have 3 children, John, Isaiah, and Susan. On June 20, 1850, Roop's wife died of typhoid fever. In 1865, Roop lived in Susanville, California. On February 14, 1869, Roop died in his residence in Susanville, California. His daughter Susan Arnold resided in the town as well until her own death in 1921, and both were buried in the town's cemetery. There is a mural depicting father and daughter in uptown Susanville, on the outside wall of Johnson's Shoes. Roop County, Nevada was named for him.

During the 1991 World Series, he played in three games and was 0-for-2; he came on in the ninth inning of game seven as a pinch runner, advancing to the third base. Brown thus had the chance to become the first rookie in baseball history to score a World Series-winning run; however, he was stranded. The Twins won anyway, getting Brown a World Series ring. After baseball After the completion of his Major League career, Jarvis Brown became head coach of the University of Wisconsin Parkside Rangers baseball program. After a three-year stint, Jarvis was relieved of his duties as head coach, in which he compiled a career record of 31-108. As of 2009, Brown was an assistant baseball coach at Carthage College.Burke, Michael. \\"WHAT'S YOUR STORY?: Jarvis Brown, a life in baseball\\", The Journal Times (Racine, Wisconsin), March 15, 2010.

They are usually classed as a toy or utility breed. A Spitz-type dog is compact of body, with a dense stand-off coat, tail curled over the back and a fox-like appearance to the head. Archaeological findings date the German Spitz to dogs that were of similar build and size during the Stone Age. Appearance The Spitz Klein has triangular ears and a small, foxy face that is less fluffy than the rest of the body, although the fur is still very thick. The fur around the neck is even thicker, giving the dog a lion-like appearance. The body has a fuzzy, woolly base underneath the straight, smooth upper coat, although it has a tendency to become crimped when wet. The tail will usually curl up over the back and sit flat. The dogs can be a wide variety of colours, including wolf sable, blue, cream, brown, orange, black, white, and a mixture of black/brown and white, and black and tan: gold and black dogs tend to predominate. The Spitz Klein ranges in height from to , and in weight from to . History The German Spitz is thought to have descended from the Nordic Samoyed and Lapphund which were most likely brought over to Germany with the Vikings during the Middle Ages, making spitzers an ancient breed. They were then spread all over Europe, where they were bred with other shepherding breeds. They were originally used as herding and guard dogs, but have been used mostly as companions for the last few centuries. Health The breed has few inherent health problems: it can be prone to patellar luxation, due to its small size, especially if overweight.

A futuristic fusion of rock and classical themes, it is regarded by some to be their best work, along with the 1971 song \\"Tarkus\\". At nearly a half an hour long, it is also their longest studio recording. Part or all of the song is included on many of the group's live albums and on all of the group's compilation albums and box sets. General information \\"Karn Evil 9\\" was written by Keith Emerson, Greg Lake, and former King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield. The phrase \\"Karn Evil\\" is sound-alike (homophonous) with the word \\"carnival\\".Liner notes, Brain Salad Surgery reissue, 1996. Rhino Entertainment R2 72459. Pg. 11-12 It is the fifth and final track on Brain Salad Surgery with a running length of 29 minutes and 37 seconds. The initial release of the album on vinyl found \\"Karn Evil 9\\" split between the two sides due to its length, with a fade out/fade in between First Impression parts 1 and 2. Subsequent releases on compact disc and digital download have \\"Karn Evil 9\\" as a single track. Impressions \\"Karn Evil 9\\" consists of three movements (called \\"impressions\\"), with the first impression being divided into two parts: * 1st Impression, Part 1 (0:00 to 8:41) * 1st Impression, Part 2 (8:42 to 13:22) * 2nd Impression (13:23 to 20:30) * 3rd Impression (20:31 to 29:37) Interpretation The story of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" is told in three parts, with the second part being an instrumental interlude. First Impression, Part 1 begins with a tale of a bleak world (although timeframe is not specified): \\"Cold and misty morning I heard a warning borne on the air ...\\" and where humanity is either being destroyed or has fallen into decay and helplessness. First Impression, Part 2 tells how the decadence of the old world is preserved through exhibits that are part of a futuristic carnival show, which exhibits depravities like \\"seven virgins and a mule\\", along with things that are rare in the future, such as a \\"real blade of grass\\". Unlike the rest of \\"Karn Evil\\", the Second Impression's instrumentation is primarily piano, bass, and drums with a solo by Emerson on a Minimoog set to imitate a steelpan. (Part of the solo very briefly quotes the main melody from Sonny Rollins's \\"St. Thomas\\".) This impression changes from an upbeat out-of-control tune to a slow interval and then picks up the pace with a structure similar to that of a sonata. It is allegedly about computers scheming against the humans, and the humans completely not suspecting this. The Third Impression continues the story begun in the first, describing a war between humans and computers, which can be interpreted in three different ways. One interpretation gives the victory to the humans, who reimpose their dominion over the computers. The second interpretation allows victory to the computers, claiming that the computers were successful in dominating the humans and let them live only for the sake of gloating. The third interpretation, consistent with Peter Sinfield's original interpretation that \\"what [Man had] invented ironically takes him over\\" has humans winning a war with the help of computers, only to find the computers taking over in the moment of victory. Writing credits and vocals * First Impression: Music by Keith Emerson, vocals and lyrics written by Greg Lake. * Second Impression: Music by Emerson. * Third Impression: Music by Emerson, lyrics by Lake and Peter Sinfield. All vocals are sung by Lake, except the computerized vocals, which are Emerson's. There is some disagreement as to how much of the lyrics were written by Sinfield. All credits listed show that Lake wrote the lyrics for First Impression alone, but Sinfield himself implies that he co-wrote all lyrics in Karn Evil 9. 'And if one doubts the prophetic power of Lake's and Sinfield's lyrics, ponder \\"Where the seeds have withered, silent children shiver in the cold/Now their faces captured in the lenses of the jackals for gold\\" during the next media foray into Bosnia or the South Bronx. Or consider \\"Performing on a stool, we've a sight to make you drool, seven virgins and a mule\\" when sampling the exploitative TV wares of Jerry, Jenny, Montel et al.' Other uses Part or all of the song is included on several of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's live albums, including: * Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ‚àΩ Ladies and Gentlemen (1974), which uses a phrase from the song in its title ‚Äì all three impressions * Live at the Royal Albert Hall (rec. 1992, rel. 1993) ‚Äì 1st Impression, Part 2 * King Biscuit Flower Hour: Greatest Hits Live (rec. 1974, rel. 1997) ‚Äì 1st Impression, Part 2 * Live in Poland (1997) ‚Äì 1st Impression, Part 2 * Then and Now (rec. 1974 and 1997‚Äì98, rel. 1998) ‚Äì two versions of 1st Impression, Part 2, and one version of 3rd Impression * The Original Bootleg Series from the Manticore Vaults (rel. 1974‚Äì93, rel. 2001‚Äì06) ‚Äì several versions in a multi-volume set * A Time and a Place (rec. 1974, rel. 2010) ‚Äì all three impressions * High Voltage (2010) ‚Äì 1st Impression, Part 2 * In the Hot Seat (2017 Deluxe Edition, rec. 1997‚Äì98, rel. 2017) ‚Äì 1st Impression, Part 2 Part or all of the song is also included on all of the group's compilation albums and box sets. First Impression Part 2 was used as the theme tune for the BBC's Jim Davidson's Generation Game during the mid late-1990s. The vocals regarding seven virgins and a mule were omitted. Alan Freeman also used the \\"welcome back my friends to the show that never ends\\" line as a jingle on many of his radio shows in the UK. In September 2007, First Impression Part 2 was included in a commercial for Dr Pepper. It is also used as the intro for the Hard Rock Park website. It has also been used as the song for the introduction of Stockton Thunder. The song was covered by guitarist Paul Gilbert on his live album Beehive Live and in the end of his instructional video Guitars from Mars II. First Impression Part 2 can also be heard in the intro of the Episode \\"Career Day\\" in Season 1 of That '70s Show, the song goes for about 10 seconds and can be faintly heard for the first minute or so until it stops completely once Eric leaves the basement. The intro of \\"Zombies, March!\\" by shock rock/thrash metal band GWAR is based on this song. The Blue Devils Drum & Bugle Corps used Karn Evil 9 for a drum break in both 1984 and 1985. It was a favorite of the 1986 World Champion New York Mets baseball team and played in the clubhouse and Shea Stadium before games. It was also used on their official 1986 season highlights home video. Bon Jovi used it as a lead in to their 1988-90 New Jersey Syndicate Tour once the lights went out before their show. First Impression Part 2 is heard in the Freaks and Geeks episode \\"The Garage Door\\". First Impression Part 2 is heard in a Dr. Pepper Commercial In February 2020, Radar Pictures announced a science fiction film inspired by Karn Evil 9 was in development, with Daniel H. Wilson to adapt the song into a screenplay. A heavily abridged edit of First Impression Part 2 is featured in a 2020 NBC NASCAR promo.

In its 50 years of activities, the company reached the number of 48 operating mills in the states of S√£o Paulo, Goi√°s, Paran√° and Minas Gerais. The projected figure for the 2009/2010 crop is 79 million tons of sugarcane, a 16% volume increase over the last crop and a strong demonstration of Copersucar‚Äôs dynamic growth drive. The company accounted for 13% of all sugar and 13% of all the ethanol commercialized in the South Central region in the last crop. Within ten years, Copersucar S.A. plans to have a 30% share of the domestic market and be one of the major world players with 12% of the global ethanol market. The company's main competitors are Cosan, Tereos Internacional, Biosev, Odebrecht Agroindustrial, among others. In addition the company owns the American ethanol company Eco-Energy. The company was created by the sugar and ethanol producers who are members of the Cooperativa de Produtores de Cana-de-A√ß√∫car, A√ß√∫car e √Ålcool do Estado de S√£o Paulo and who are now the shareholders of Produpar, the holding company controlling Copersucar. The new business model permits the producer-shareholders to maintain their independence, autonomy, and the specific efficiencies of their production units, while enabling them to participate effectively in all other stages of the business chain, in which scale and knowledge of global markets are fundamental for generating and capturing value. Copersucar has a unique business model, because it combines production efficiency in the mills, managed by the producers, with gains in scale in logistics, commercialization and risk management.

They have brought with them a Southern Russian dialect of their communities of origin, which over the following decades underwent some changes under the influence of the Canadian English environment and the speech of the Ukrainian settlers in Saskatchewan. Over several generations, this dialect has been mostly lost, as the modern descendants of the original Doukhobor migrants to Canada are typically native English speakers, and when they do speak Russian, it is typically a fairly standard variety of it.  Linguistic history of the Doukhobors  It is reasonable to assume that the formative period for the speech of the Doukhobors was the first four decades of the 19th century. It was in 1802 that the Doukhobors, as well as the members of Russia's other dissenter Christian groups, were encouraged to migrate to the Molochna River region, around Melitopol near Ukraine's Sea of Azov coast. Over the next 10‚Äì20 years, the Doukhobor, Molokan, and other settlers, speaking a variety of mostly Southern Russian dialects arrived to the Molochna from several provinces located, primarily, in what is today eastern Ukraine and south- central Russia.See J.J. Kalmakoff's map, \\"Doukhobor Resettlement to Tavria\\" (Doukhobor Genealogy Website). In the settlers' villages an opportunity thus arose for the formation of a certain dialect koin√©, based on Southern Russian and Eastern Ukrainian dialects. Starting in 1841, the Doukhobors (as well as Molokans and certain other dissenters) were resettled from southern Ukraine to Transcaucasia, where they founded a number of villages surrounded by mostly non-Russian speaking neighbors (primarily Azerbaijanis in Elisabethpol Governorate, ArmeniansTiflis Governorate was in Georgia, it is ethnic Armenians who populated its Samtskhe-Javakheti area, where the Doukhobor villages were in Tiflis Governorate, and likely a mix of both in the later (post-1878) settlements in Kars Oblast). These conditions allowed the dialect to develop in comparative isolation from the \\"mainstream\\" Russian. With the migration of some 7,500 Doukhbors from Transcaucasia to Saskatchewan in 1899, and some smaller latecomer groups (both from Transcaucasia and from places of exile in Siberia and elsewhere), the dialect spoken in the Doukhobor villages of Transcaucasia was brought to the plains of Canada. From that point on it experienced influence from the English language of Canada and, during the years of Doukhobor stay in Saskatchewan, the speech of Doukhobor's Ukrainian neighbors. A split in the Doukhobor community resulted in a large number of Doukhobors moving from Saskatchewan to south-eastern British Columbia around 1910. Those who moved (the so-called \\"Community Doukhobors\\" ‚Äì followers of Peter Verigin's Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood ‚Äì continued living a communal lifestyle for several more decades, and had a better chance to preserve the Russian language than the \\"Independent Doukhobors\\", who stayed in Saskatchewan as individual farmers. By the 1970s, as most Russia-born members of the community died, English became the first language of the great majority of Canadian Doukhobors.Dr. John I. Postnikoff Doukhobors: An Endangered Species MIR magazine, No. 16 (Grand Forks, BC: MIR Publication Society, May 1978) (Doukhobor Genealogy Website). Their English speech is not noticeably different from that of other English-speaking Canadians of their provinces. Russian still remains in use, at least for religious use among those who do practise the Doukhobor religion. However, practising Doukhobors are a shrinking group, with only some 3,800 persons in Canada identifying themselves as members of the Doukhobor religion as of the Canada 2001 Census.  Features of the Doukhobor Russian dialect in Canada  According to Gunter Schaarschmidt's survey article (\\"Four norms...\\"), research into the Russian spoken by Canada's Doukhobors has not been extensive. However, a number of articles, mostly published in the 1960s and 1970s, noted a variety of features in Doukhobors' Russian speech that were indeed characteristic of Southern, and in some cases Central Russian dialects, e.g. use of the Southern [h] where Standard Russian has [g]. Features characteristic of a number of locales in the East Slavic language space were noted as well, reflecting perhaps the heterogeneous origin of the Doukhobors' settlements in Molochna River after 1800, e.g., similarly to Belarusians, Doukhobor speakers don't palatalize [r] in \\"—Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ\\" (redko, 'seldom'). Remarkable was the dropping of the final -t in the 3rd person singular form of verbs. This can be considered a Ukrainian feature, and it is also attested in some Russian dialects spoken in Southern Ukraine (e.g., Nikolaev, not too far from the Doukhobors' old homeland on the Molochna). As with other immigrant groups, the Russian speech of the Doukhobors uses English loanwords for some concepts that they had not encountered until moving to Canada.

Its population is over 28,000 people according to the 2004 census. The municipality (munic√≠pio) of Coromandel is located 495 km from the state capital Belo Horizonte, and 673 km from S√£o Paulo. Coromandel is one of the municipalities of the Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro/Alto Parana√≠ba micro region and its territorial size is 3,296 km¬≤. Its borders are limited in the north by state of Goi√°s and Guarda-Mor municipality, east by the municipalities of Vazante, Lagamar, Patos de Minas and Guimar√¢nia, west by the municipalities of Abadia dos Dourados and Monte Carmelo, and south by Patroc√≠nio municipality. Coromandel has six districts: Alegre, Santa Rosa, P√¢ntano de Santa Cruz, Lagamar dos Coqueiros and Mateiro. Its economy is largely promoted by cerrado coffee agriculture (the legitimate Brazilian coffee for exportation) and plantations of soybean and corn. Also dairy farms supply several dairy products industries in the city. Cattle farms supply with its livestock meat to industries. Another important part of the economy is mining, for example the calcareous rocks exploration that is plenty used for agricultures to correct soil acidity. Diamond exploration has its importance as well, especially for local miners and companies. One of the most important diamonds in the world was discovered in Coromandel in 1938, named as Get√∫lio Vargas Diamond, it was a pure, rare and precious stone. The origins of the name Coromandel is not decisively known among its population, but older generations believe the name is connected to the Coromandel Coast, in India, from where ships loaded with slaves would have departed.

Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day, also termed Take Your Child to Work Day, is a national day that gives children in the United States a glimpse into the working world. Developed by the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organisation, the day revolves around parents taking their children to work to expose students to future job possibilities and the value of education. It is the successor to Take Our Daughters To Work Day, which was expanded to include boys in 2003. In the U.S., it occurs on the fourth Thursday in April every year. The most recent Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day occurred on Thursday, April 23, 2020. In 2018, more than 37 million Americans at over 3.5 million workplaces participated.  History  Take Our Daughters to Work Day was created in New York City in the summer of 1992 by the Ms. Foundation for Women and its president, Marie C. Wilson, the Women's foundation treasurer, Daren Ball, and with support from foundation founder Gloria Steinem. The first celebration took place on April 28, 1993, and has since been celebrated usually on the fourth Thursday of April in order for the 37 million children, parents, schools in over 3.5 million workplaces across the country, in addition to participants in over 200 countries around the world, to plan ahead for the annual event. The day has generally been scheduled on a day that is a school day for most children in the United States, and schools are provided with literature and encouraged to promote the program. Educators are provided with materials for incorporating career exploration into school curricula on the day before or after the event. The program was officially expanded in 2003 to include boys; however, most companies that participated in the program had, since the beginning, allowed both boys and girls to participate, usually renaming it \\"Take Our Children to Work Day\\" or an equivalent. The program's official website states that the program was changed in order to provide both boys and girls with opportunities to explore careers at an age when they are more flexible in terms of gender roles. The Ms. Foundation also states that men who have hosted children have benefited from being seen as parental figures in addition to their roles as professionals, which can contribute to combating gender stereotypes as well. Prior to the inclusion of boys, the Ms. Foundation contended that the program was designed to specifically address self-esteem issues unique to girls and initially resisted pressure to include boys. Much of this pressure came from educators who did not wish to include the event in their curriculum given that their male students were not encouraged to participate. In 2007, upon becoming its own separate foundation, the Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work program was turned over to Carolyn McKecuen, a MacArthur Genius Award recipient, who took effective control as its executive director before relocating to Elizabeth City, North Carolina where it has remained since. Gloria Steinem continues to maintain a role with the Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Foundation as a member of its board of directors. Employees across the United States and around the world typically invite their own children or relatives to join them at work, but the program particularly encourages employees to invite children from residential programs or shelters who may not be exposed to many adults in skilled professions today.

The Leibniz operator was introduced by Wim Blok and Don Pigozzi, two of the founders of the field, as a means to abstract the well-known Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski process, that leads to the association of Boolean algebras to classical propositional calculus, and make it applicable to as wide a variety of sentential logics as possible. It is an operator that assigns to a given theory of a given sentential logic, perceived as a free algebra with a consequence operation on its universe, the largest congruence on the algebra that is compatible with the theory. Formulation In this article, we introduce the Leibniz operator in the special case of classical propositional calculus, then we abstract it to the general notion applied to an arbitrary sentential logic and, finally, we summarize some of the most important consequences of its use in the theory of abstract algebraic logic. Let :\\\\mathcal{S}=\\\\langle{\\\\rm Fm},\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\rangle denote the classical propositional calculus. According to the classical Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski process, given a theory T of \\\\mathcal{S}, if \\\\equiv_{T} denotes the binary relation on the set of formulas of \\\\mathcal{S}, defined by :\\\\phi\\\\equiv_{T}\\\\psi if and only if T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\phi\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\psi, where \\\\leftrightarrow denotes the usual classical propositional equivalence connective, then \\\\equiv_{T} turns out to be a congruence on the formula algebra. Furthermore, the quotient {\\\\rm Fm}/{\\\\equiv_{T}} is a Boolean algebra and every Boolean algebra may be formed in this way. Thus, the variety of Boolean algebras, which is, in algebraic logic terminology, the equivalent algebraic semantics (algebraic counterpart) of classical propositional calculus, is the class of all algebras formed by taking appropriate quotients of free algebras by those special kinds of congruences. The condition :T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\phi\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\psi that defines \\\\phi\\\\equiv_{T}\\\\psi is equivalent to the condition :T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\phi if and only if T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\psi. Passing now to an arbitrary sentential logic :\\\\mathcal{S}=\\\\langle{\\\\rm Fm}, \\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\rangle, given a theory T, the Leibniz congruence associated with T is denoted by \\\\Omega(T) and is defined, for all \\\\phi,\\\\psi\\\\in{\\\\rm Fm}, by :\\\\phi\\\\Omega(T)\\\\psi if and only if, for every formula \\\\alpha(x,\\\\vec{y}) containing a variable x and possibly other variables in the list \\\\vec{y}, and all formulas \\\\vec{\\\\chi} forming a list of the same length as that of \\\\vec{y}, we have that :T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\alpha(\\\\phi,\\\\vec{\\\\chi}) if and only if T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\alpha(\\\\psi,\\\\vec{\\\\chi}). It turns out that this binary relation is a congruence relation on the formula algebra and, in fact, may alternatively be characterized as the largest congruence on the formula algebra that is compatible with the theory T, in the sense that if \\\\phi\\\\Omega(T)\\\\psi and T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\phi, then we must have also T\\\\vdash_{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\psi. It is this congruence that plays the same role as the congruence used in the traditional Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski process described above in the context of an arbitrary sentential logic. It is not, however, the case that for arbitrary sentential logics the quotients of the free algebras by these Leibniz congruences over different theories yield all algebras in the class that forms the natural algebraic counterpart of the sentential logic. This phenomenon occurs only in the case of \\"nice\\" logics and one of the main goals of abstract algebraic logic is to make this vague notion of a logic being \\"nice\\", in this sense, mathematically precise. The Leibniz operator :\\\\Omega is the operator that maps a theory T of a given logic to the Leibniz congruence :\\\\Omega(T), associated with the theory. Thus, formally, :\\\\Omega: \\\\mathrm{Th} (\\\\mathcal{S}) \\\\rightarrow{\\\\rm Con}({\\\\rm Fm}) is a mapping from the collection :{\\\\rm Th}(\\\\mathcal{S}) of the theories of a sentential logic \\\\mathcal{S} to the collection :{\\\\rm Con}({\\\\rm Fm}) of all congruences on the formula algebra {\\\\rm Fm} of the sentential logic. Hierarchy The Leibniz operator and the study of various of its properties that may or may not be satisfied for particular sentential logics have given rise to what is now known as the abstract algebraic hierarchy or Leibniz hierarchy of sentential logics. Logics are classified in various levels of this hierarchy depending on how strong a tie exists between the logic and its algebraic counterpart. The properties of the Leibniz operator that help classify the logics are monotonicity, injectivity, continuity and commutativity with inverse substitutions. For instance, protoalgebraic logics, forming the widest class in the hierarchy, i.e., the one that lies in the bottom of the hierarchy and contains all other classes, are characterized by the monotonicity of the Leibniz operator on their theories. Other notable classes are formed by the equivalential logics, the weakly algebraizable logics and the algebraizable logics, among others. There is a generalization of the Leibniz operator, in the context of categorical abstract algebraic logic, that makes it possible to apply a wide variety of techniques that were previously applicable only in the sentential logic framework to logics formalized as \\\\pi-institutions. The \\\\pi- institution framework is significantly wider in scope than the framework of sentential logics because it allows incorporating multiple signatures and quantifiers in the language and it provides a mechanism for handling logics that are not syntactically based.

Mishkin and Cohn entered the comics industry together following a correspondence with Jack C. Harris, an editor at DC Comics. Their first work for the company was the three-page short story \\"On the Day of His Return\\" published in Time Warp #3 (February‚ÄìMarch 1980) and drawn by Steve Ditko. They wrote several stories for various mystery titles as well as the \\"OMAC\\" backup in The Warlord. In 1983, Mishkin, Cohn and artist Ernie Col√≥n created Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld.

An Artmedia regular and diagnosis of a brain tumour In the seasons following ƒåobej soon became the first choice keeper at Artmedia, however during the 2005‚Äì06 season he was forced out of the game for several months after doctors discovered that he had developed a brain tumour. The tumour was successfully treated and he returned to the first team to feature as one of the most important players during the club's famous run which saw them reach the lucrative group stages of the UEFA Champions League in 2005‚Äì06. In 2007 after a number of successful seasons with Artmedia ƒåobejs lost his place in the starting line up. At the start of the 2008-09 he was fighting to return to the Artmedia first team. International selection On 20 May 2006 ƒåobej played his first and only game for the Slovak national team, featuring for just two minutes. Away from football ƒåobej is married, has two daughters and lives on the outskirts of Bratislava. *Height: 199 cm *Weight: 85 kg *Squad Number: 1 *Position: Goalkeeper *League starts: 187 *CL starts: 12 References External links * Profile at Artmedia Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Stropkov Category:Slovak footballers Category:FC Petr≈æalka players Category:≈†K Slovan Bratislava players Category:Partiz√°n Bardejov players Category:Slovakia international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Slovak Super Liga players ","title":"Juraj ƒåobej"},{"id":"4827706","text":"Gary Miller presents Volker Strassen with the 2008 Knuth Prize at SODA 2009.

His brother, K2 Young, had made in- roads in the reggaet√≥n genre as a member of DJ Playero's crew. He was friends with Baby Ranks, with whom he often performed. Divino decided that it was his brother's fate to conquer the genre, while his own musical aspirations faded to the background. In 1999, Divino's brother was killed, only one day after celebrating his 21st birthday. Baby Ranks then asked Divino to join him on a track he was recording for the production Darwins The Music II. Later, they joined forces again for the hit Quiero Esa Nena from DJ Nelsons The Flow: Sweet Dreams. Impressed by Divino's voice and his unique songwriting abilities, other artists began requesting that he appear on their records. Perhaps the most pivotal release in Divino's career was the song Quiero Saber, which he recorded for the compilation album MVP which sold over 100,000 copies in 2002. Shortly thereafter, Jos√© Angel Gocho Torres, the producer of MVP, teamed up with Ra√∫l L√≥pez, CEO of Luar Music and MVP Records. Gocho approached Divino and asked if he would be interested in signing to the upstart label of MVP Records, Divino quickly agreed. In 2003, he released his solo album Todo A Su Tiempo, which included such hits as the Daddy Yankee collaboration Se Activaron Los Anormales, Super Gangsteril featuring Polaco, Ya Estoy Llegando, and the ballad Dile Mar. But the most meaningful song for Divino was the profoundly personal Una L√°grima, a tribute to his late brother. Divino briefly was a part of the label Drama Records owned by Ivy Queen from 2007 to 2008 where he released one single \\"Pobre Coraz√≥n\\" for her album Sentimiento (2007). Moved by his introspective lyrics and his distinctive flow, audiences and critics alike began to take note. Todo A Su Tiempo achieved gold status and Divino earned two nominations for the 2004 Billboard Awards: one for Best New Artist and another for Best Tropical Album. Since then, Divino has released such hits as Ll√©gale, featured in Hector El Father Presenta Los Anormales and Un Simple Bandolero, featured in MVP 2:The Grand Slam. With reggaet√≥n earning international acclaim and Divino poised for even greater success, MVP Records released Todo A Su Tiempo: Platinum Edition in 2006. The album includes original recordings from Todo A Su Tiempo, and the hits Noche de Travesura, Un Simple Bandolero and Ll√©gale, with two brand new songs, Amor de Una Noche and Para Donde Voy. later in 2010 He is also recording his second solo album, Por Experiencias Propias.

He served as long-time professor of the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw, and taught future luminaries of Polish neo-romanticism including J√≥zef Che≈Çmo≈Ñski, Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Podkowi≈Ñski, J√≥zef Pankiewicz and Anna Bili≈Ñska- Bohdanowiczowa among others. He also wrote art-reviews and published a book of anatomy for the artists. A large number of his paintings were stolen by Nazi Germany in World War II, and never recovered. Biography Gerson was born in Warsaw during the November Uprising against the Russians. He enrolled at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 1844 and graduated with honors in 1850. In 1853 Gerson received a scholarship to the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, and spent two years studying historical painting with Alexey Markov. He graduated with a silver medal in St. Petersburg and returned to Warsaw in 1855. He left for Paris in 1856 and studied under L√©on Cogniet and others. Gerson came back to Poland in February 1858. He resided in Warsaw for the rest of his life, nevertheless continued to travel abroad, until the turn of the century. Gerson was a co-founder of the Fine-Arts Society \\"Zachƒôta\\" established in 1860. It was the first support-group of its kind in Warsaw under the foreign occupation. He began to teach art in his own workshop in 1865, and became professor at the School of Fine Arts (future Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw) in 1872. He trained a generation of future Polish artists there, until his retirement in 1896. Gerson introduced the outdoor landscape trips and genre studies to his students with considerable impact on the art of J√≥zef Che≈Çmo≈Ñski, the monumental painter with gallery named after him at Sukiennice; Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski, the leading field painter of the Young Poland movement; Antoni Piotrowski revered as far as Bulgaria for his epic war-scenes, as well as impressionist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Podkowi≈Ñski and his contemporaries. Gerson was granted the title of academic by the St. Petersburg Fine Arts Academy in 1873 and named a professor in 1878. Gerson also worked as an architect and art critic. He is revered in Poland for his historical paintings of patriotic nature, scenes of country life, and mountain landscapes. Gerson died in Warsaw, at the age of 70, and is buried in the Evangelical Cemetery of the Augsburg Confession in Warsaw. His paintings can be seen at the National Museum, Warsaw; Upper Silesian Museum in Bytom, and in other branches of the National Museum of Poland as well as in selected churches.

Synopsis The show stars Carl Betz, who had previously spent eight years in the role of Dr. Alex Stone, husband of Donna Reed in ABC's The Donna Reed Show. In his new role, reportedly based on high-profile lawyers such as F. Lee Bailey and Percy Foreman,Jamail Center for Legal Research, Tarlton Law Library, University of Texas at Austin Law School. Betz played Clinton Judd, a flamboyant attorney based in Houston, who often took on controversial cases across the country. Playing his top assistant, Ben Caldwell, was Stephen Young. Even before the show premiered, Foreman threatened a lawsuit by saying that the program was \\"appropriating for commercial purposes my career as a lawyer.\\" Throughout the course of the two-year run of the show, there were never enough viewers to establish Foreman's claim, although critics gave it positive reviews. Undoubtedly, the skittishness of viewers was a result of the program's dealing with then-taboo (though contemporary) subjects such as homosexuality, blacklisting, and draft evasion, with open-ended conclusions in many episodes. The show's producer, Harold Gast, sought to break new ground with the program, using a number of new writers for scripts that veered away from previous television conventions. In addition, one personal experience involving credit card problems caused by computers became the basis for an episode titled \\"Epitaph on a Computer Card\\". In 1968, Gast and writer Leon Tokatyan won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the episode \\"Tempest in a Texas Town\\". In an attempt to boost the low ratings of the hour-long program, the episode which aired on January 31, 1969, combined the Judd cast with that of another ABC series, Felony Squad, starring Dennis Cole. The idea did not salvage either program, as both were soon cancelled. Betz's portrayal of a lawyer was enough to provide him paid opportunities to speak before groups of attorneys, and also helped him win both Golden Globe and Emmy Awards after the show's final season. Additionally, screenwriter Robert Lewin won a Writer's Guild award for the episode \\"To Kill a Madman\\". Other actors appearing on episodes of the show included Ed Asner, Karen Black, Scott Brady, Len Birman, Russ Conway, Tyne Daly, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Duvall, Lee Grant, Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr., Ron Howard, Vivi Janiss, Wright King, Ida Lupino, Barry Morse, Jessica Tandy, Lurene Tuttle, and William Windom.Id.

Summary Walsh developed as a township central crossroads gathering point on Young's Creek, in the first quarter of the 19th century. A number of service businesses have come and gone over the years, as road quality improved and practical travel distances increased. No commercial business are remaining in the community, although Walsh is home to two elementary schools, two Christian churches, the township community hall that hosts an annual fall fair and the operating headquarters of a major regional transportation company. Walsh is located near streams, valleys, conservation areas, and bays. Notable attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Walsh include the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, Turkey Point Beach, Lake Erie, and various rural cemeteries. During the fall months, pumpkins become abundant in the area - especially the rare \\"dwarf albino\\" pumpkin. Robins can be seen strutting through the local gardens for all 12 months of the year.

Walsh Area Public School was constructed in 1959 on an open-field site along the north side of St. John's Road, between the Turkey Point Road and Young's Creek. It opened in March 1960, a four-room school that culminated a five-year consolidation effort that merged four one- and two-room elementary schools within five miles of the village: Walsh, Tisdale, Elmwood and McKnight. The guest of honour at the official opening in September 1960 was Education Minister and future Premier John Robarts. Expansion of the public school came in three phases over the next 15 years to achieve its current configuration. It also had its name shortened to Walsh Public School.

St. Michael's Elementary School was launched in the early 1950s, initially in the basement of St. Michael's Catholic Church next door. The current school was opened in January 1961 as a two-room school and subsequently has been expanded to the present structure. Graduates can advance preferentially to Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe. A local bursary; known as the Charlotteville Bursary has been traditionally awarded for secondary school graduates from the Walsh area as an incentive to attend either the college or university of their choice. =Nearest communities= Walsh is located near these major communities: Simcoe - , Delhi - , Port Dover - , Tillsonburg - , Brantford - and Woodstock - . Mount Forest is located to the north of this community.Walsh information at TravelingLuck.com, accessed 19 February 2012 It is an unincorporated community located on the junction of Ontario Highways 6 and 89 in the township of Wellington North. =Places of worship= The first Christian community established in Walsh was the Charlotteville Methodist Church, constructed in 1856 and located 1.3 kilometres to the south. That community thrived through the 1925 merger that created the United Church of Canada and beyond but suffered badly from declining membership during the Great Depression and it ceased operation in the early 1940s. After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the building was demolished in 1962. A commemorative monument remains, in the northeast corner of the cemetery. Two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents: Walsh Baptist Church and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church. Walsh Baptist Church was established in 1876 and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time. During the first few decades of the 20th century, a close collaboration developed with the Charlotteville Methodist Church. When the Walsh United Church dissolved early during the Second World War, their remaining members were welcomed into the Baptist community. The Baptist church annex including Sunday school classrooms, church hall, kitchen, and washrooms was constructed during the winter of 1961-62. The Walsh Baptist Church is led by Pastor Marc Bertrand; who has served the region since 2003.Walsh Baptist Church at Christian-Discipleship.com, accessed 18 February 2012Pastor Marc Bertrand information at SermonCentral.com, accessed 18 February 2012 St. Michael's Catholic Church was established in 1947. Although it functioned as a mission church of St. Cecilia's Parish in Port Dover in earlier years, St. Michael's is now under the care of the Sacred Heart Parish in Langton. Another church that survived for about 35 years was the independent Faith Baptist Church, which officially broke away from the congregation of the regular Baptist church in 1926. Located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection, dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early 1960s. After several years of commercial usage, the building was demolished. =Cemeteries= The Walsh Baptist Cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the Turkey Point Road, north of the main intersection. It has the buried remains of at least 133 individuals or families. Common last names of people buried at the Walsh Baptist Cemetery include Atkinson, Bingleman, Bint, Bye, Cope, Ferris, Pepper, and Shepherd.

They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas. The first Caucasian settlers in Charlotteville were the United Empire Loyalist settlers from just prior to the year 1800. Charlotteville was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, the ruling monarch at the time. Charlotteville, roughly 100 square miles was surveyed by the Walsh/Welch family, with the work completed by 1805. The township was laid out, nine miles wide, back from the nominal shoreline of Lake Erie. On a 180-chain spacing (about four kilometres) between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road, now known as the Turkey Point road, running northwards, from Turkey Point, through Charlotteville Centre and beyond. Perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads, spaced 70 chains apart (about 1.5 kilometres), from the Lake Erie shore, back to the north boundary. The Township of Charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the County of Norfolk, in 1850. Because of its convenient central location, Charlotteville Centre, now known as Walsh, was designated the administrative centre. The Township Hall building, constructed at a cost of $700 in 1868 still stands. In later years, the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of Vittoria, four miles to the southeast. Walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after Charlotteville Township was surveyed. Located at the intersection of the middle of five north-south \\"line roads\\" and the sixth of twelve west-east concession roads made it a logical central focus point for the growing township. Railway service once provided freight and passenger service at a railway junction, three concessions to the south, known as Walsh Station () from its inception in 1886 by the South Norfolk Railway until all service was terminated in 1962 by the Canadian National Railways. Canadian National removed the railway tracks three years later in 1965. The proximity to Young's Creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location. From a geographical perspective, Young's Creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through Walsh, and then Vittoria, before discharging into Lake Erie, away in Port Ryerse.Young's Creek information at TravelingLuck.com, accessed 20 February 2012 This creek would eventually provide water to nearby Vitorria in addition to Greens Corners, Port Ryerse, Normandale, Turkey Point, St. Williams and Port Rowan. =20th century= With the escalation of gasoline consumption after the Great Depression, the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late 1950s. Gas prices reached 5.5 cents a litre by 1959 due to the low fuel taxes and surplus of oil from the Middle East during that era.Your money ‚Äì Farm productivity benefits the average family at Farm Credit Canada At that time, Walsh had three such businesses. Colwell, General Merchant, described more fully below, was located on the northwest corner of the main intersection and sold Supertest products. Facing them, across the road, on the northeast corner was another general store, Earle's Grocery, that sold Reliance products. Ironically, Supertest and Reliance were of the same corporate ownership but operated as separate companies. Half a block to the south of Earle's was the village's only full scope service station, Engell's Walsh Garage that sold Texaco products. At Walsh Station located five kilometers to the south, Cherwaty's Service sold Fina products during the early years of his business. He would keep the business selling Petro-Canada products before passing away in 2008 at the Leisure World in Brantford.Paul Cherwaty's death on The Simcoe Reformer's official website, accessed 23 February 2012 Unfortunately, the local gasoline retailers have all gone out of business. The gas station at the general store belonging to the parents of local petroliana collector Alex Colwell handled Supertest products for oil and automobile gasoline.About Alex Colwell from Walsh, Ontario at BritishAmericanOil.com, accessed 19 February 2012 Supertest was an all-Canadian company that operated until being bought out by BP Canada in the 1970s (which was bought out by Petro-Canada in 1983).Supertest Chronology at AllCanadianCompany.com, accessed 19 February 2012 Natural gas production is found throughout the Walsh area; this production spreads as fast east as Vittoria and as far west as Jericho and Silver Hill.Natural Gas Production System at Metalore Resources Ltd., accessed 27 July 2012 More than of petroleum and mineral leases are within the boundaries of Walsh along with the nearby communities of Walsingham and Houghton.

Donnybrook Fair An annual fair held in the hamlet called the Donnybrook Fair attracts kids and adults from the area in the middle of September.Donnybrook Fair information at DonnybrookFair.ca, accessed 19 February 2012 It has been held since 1857, with the fair growing in size and quality every year. Children who attend school within the immediate vicinity are allowed to enter any artwork that they produced themselves in addition to their own crafts and agriculture-related artifacts. They are typically between the ages of 5 and 13. Homeschooled children may also enter the contests. In the 2011 edition of the Donnybrook Fair, these local students have managed to win $1346 in tax-free cash. This monetary award encourages children to save up for higher education opportunities. The short-term effects of the award system encourages children to work on their innovative spirit and improve their work ethics. Although the winner of the Donnybrook Fair demolition derby is no longer assured a spot in the Norfolk County Fair version of the event, the prize money keeps increasing and the event is done over a traditional dirt track. Fundraising for the Donnybrook Fair involves a Victoria Day brunch, an annual spring barbecue, and numerous raffles.

Walsh, Canadian lawyer and judge Climate Throughout the history of the hamlet, Walsh has seen temperatures as cold as and as hot as . Summers have typically been around for most of Walsh's history. Winter activities are possible between the months of December and March; although recent years have made March and sometimes December too mild for the snow to form. Even during the coldest years, no snow-related activities are possible between April and November. The winter of 1975 was the only unusually mild winter in the region from 1897 to 1977. From the late 1990s onwards, winters became more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. As in all communities, towns and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Walsh over the decades. The warmest summers that Walsh has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Should the sea levels rise by , Walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding. However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available freshwater resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from freshwater sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.

From a long soldierly line and famous Gaelic stock, Hickie's name is best remembered as one of the notable Irishman who served during the First World War. Two of his four brothers also served, one as a major in the Royal Artillery before becoming a priest. Hickie was educated at St Mary's College, Oscott, Birmingham, a renowned seminary for training youths of prosperous Roman Catholic families.

In 1899 he graduated as captain at the Staff College, Camberley and was selected when the Second Boer War broke out as a Special Service Officer in which capacity he acted in various positions of authority and command. He left Southampton for South Africa on board the SS Canada in early February 1900, and was promoted from captain of mounted infantry to battalion command as major on 17 March 1900. He was subsequently in command of a corps until eventually at the end of 1900 he was given command of an independent column of all arms. This he held for eighteen months.

Promoted major general, Hickie took over from Lieutenant General Sir Lawrence Parsons. Hickie ‚Äì one of a rare breed, a senior, Irish, Catholic officer ‚Äì was a popular replacement. It was politically a highly sensitive appointment which required the professionalism and political awareness Hickie fortunately possessed as the division was formed around a core of Irish National Volunteers in response to Carson's Ulster Volunteers. He was much more diplomatic and tactful than his predecessors and spoke of the pride which his new command gave him,Irish Regiments in the Great War p. 119, Timothy Bowmann (2003) but did not hesitate to make sweeping changes amongst the senior officers of the Irish Division. After putting the division through intensive training, it left under Irish command of which each man took personal pride. It arrived in December 1915. Distinguished service General W B Hickie In the next two years and four months during which Hickie commanded the 16th (Irish) Division, it earned a reputation for aggression and √©lan and won many memorials and mentions for bravery in the engagements during the 1916 Battle of Guillemont and the capture of Ginchy, then during the Battle of Messines, in appalling conditions the Third Battle of Ypres and in attacks near Bullecourt in the Battle of Cambrai offensive in November 1917. During this period the Division made considerable progress in developing its operational techniques but at a price in losses. Hickie through integrating non-Irish soldiers into the division because of the growing shortage of Irish replacement recruits (due to nationalist disenchantment with the war and the absence of conscription in Ireland).Corrigan, G. (2003) Mud Blood & Poppycock, Cassell, In February 1918 Hickie was invalided home on temporary sick leave, but when in hospital the German Spring Offensive began on 21 March, with the result that after his division moved under the command of General Hubert Gough it was practically wiped out and ceased to exist as a division. Although promised a new command, this did not happen before the Armistice in November. Hickie had typified the army‚Äôs better divisional commanders, was articulate, intelligent and had been competent and resourceful during the BEF‚Äôs difficult period 1916‚Äì17, laying the foundations for its full tactical success in 1918.

In addition to local and long-distance telephone service, Frontier offers broadband Internet, digital television service, and computer technical support to residential and business customers in 29 states in the United States. Frontier is the eighth largest provider of broadband internet in the United States with 3,735,000 subscribers. It is also the 11th largest pay television provider in the United States with 838,000 subscribers. The company filed for bankruptcy in April 2020. History Originally based in Minneapolis, Citizens Utilities Company was formed from remnants of Public Utilities Consolidated Corporation, owned by Wilbur B. Foshay, in 1935. As the post-war years started, the company caught the interest of a New York investor.

The stock began trading under the same \\"FTR\\" symbol on the NASDAQ exchange at the start of the December 16, 2011, trading day. =Purchase of Verizon lines= In May 2009, Frontier announced that it would acquire Verizon Communications' landline assets in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin for $8.6 billion. Verizon had been in the process of divesting its landlines in an effort to focus more on its broadband and wireless businesses. In all states other than West Virginia, this takeover primarily involved rural exchanges that were formerly a part of the GTE system when Verizon Communications was formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. However, in West Virginia, Frontier acquired Verizon West Virginia, formerly The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia, a former Bell System unit. When combined with its existing subsidiary Citizens Telecommunications Company of West Virginia, Frontier became the incumbent local exchange carrier (or ILEC) telephone company for all but five exchanges in the entire state. The transition was finalized on July 1, 2010; in some states, Frontier was required not to raise rates, and in others, broadband access was to be expanded. Ninety-two percent of people in Frontier's existing service area had access to broadband, while just 65 percent did in the newly acquired areas, with a goal to reach 85 percent in three years. On February 5, 2015, Frontier announced that it would acquire Verizon's wireline assets in California, Florida and Texas for $10.5 billion. =Purchase of AT&T; lines= On October 24, 2014, Frontier closed its acquisition of AT&T;'s wireline, DSL, U-verse video and satellite TV businesses in Connecticut.

Frontier starts with the 8 percent year-over-year decline in revenue, outpacing attempts to cut costs. The ratio of operating income to sales in Q1 dropped from 16.1 percent to just 14.1 percent in the next year. In January 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Frontier was \\"asking creditors to help craft a turnaround deal that includes filing for bankruptcy by the middle of March\\", amidst declining revenue. On April 14, 2020, Frontier Communications filed for bankruptcy. As currently filed, the restructuring plan would wipe out current shareholders, who‚Äôve already lost more than 90 percent this year alone. Fiber optic and Internet services =Frontier FiOS= In addition to the purchase of copper lines from Verizon, over time Frontier also acquired the fiber-optic system built by Verizon primarily in Fort Wayne, Indiana, around Portland, Oregon, the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, Southern California, some eastern suburbs of Seattle, Washington, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, and the Greenville area in South Carolina. The company kept the name \\"FiOS\\" for the fiber systems and licenses it acquired from Verizon. The initial transition was rocky, with Frontier initially claiming that it had no plans for changes after the transition, but later attempted to institute a $500 installation fee for new television subscribers, backed out of franchise agreements in some cities in Oregon, and increased rates by 50% in Indiana. Frontier later retracted the rate increases and installation fee, but has not reclaimed franchises in the cities that it relinquished and not before losing FiOS TV subscribers. Frontier FiOS service in most markets operates on the same technology and software as the Verizon FiOS system. = Frontier DSL Broadband = In parts of upstate New York and other rural markets Frontier offers only DSL internet service to its customers using traditional copper wires. PC Magazine's annual survey of ISP customer satisfaction regularly lists Frontier's DSL service at or near the bottom in terms of \\"Overall Satisfaction\\"; other outlets, including Consumer Affairs, report similar general sentiments from customers regarding Frontier DSL.  Criticism  = West Virginia DSL speeds = In 2015, Frontier agreed to a settlement in West Virginia, over a class-action lawsuit alleging that the company's DSL services in the region did not meet the advertised speeds (such as advertising 6 Mbit/s but only delivering 1.5). The company committed to spending at least $150 million on improving its broadband infrastructure in the region, and promised to discount users who were affected by this. = Service fees = All Frontier FiOS subscribers are charged a fee of $10 for renting a router, even if they have installed their own router, or bought one outright from Verizon prior to the acquisition of their market's operations by Frontier. The company argued that these fees are necessary in order to cover the additional costs of supporting equipment that is not provisioned by Frontier itself.

It is between Ballinamallard and Trillick. In the 2001 census it had a population of 57 people. Kilskeery is within the Omagh District Council area. The Ballinamallard River flows through the village towards Lough Erne. The village has two graveyards within its boundaries. The \\"old\\" graveyard surrounded by stone walls has graves from the 19th century.  Schools  * Queen Elizabeth II Primary School and the Free Presbyterian School.  Layout  The village is headed at the north by the local Church of Ireland church standing on top of a hill overlooking the village, at over 400 years old it once was overnight refuge for the famous King William of Orange. A few years ago uplighting was added around the church making it an amazing sight when it gets dark. The church has a tower with a bell that can be heard for miles around, and is used on Sunday mornings. The Church is surrounded by what is referred to as the 'new' graveyard and just behind the church is the Sunday school rooms, built quite recently to accommodate the expanding Sunday school classes. Behind the church grounds is the local primary school, the Queen Elizabeth II. It has two classrooms and a dining hall, outside is the playing field and the school garden. The row of houses leading southwards from the church is called Beatty Terrace, a row of medium-sized semi detached houses which originally had the same floor plans but due to renovation work now differ slightly. Opposite Beatty Terrace is the Church hall, on the same site as the old Church hall the new building is larger and better equipped than the old one as it has a larger hall, kitchen and an upstairs meeting room. At the end of Beatty Terrace there is the village green, a grassy area with some trees scattered through it and benches which on a sunny day attract travellers to stop and have a picnic. Just behind the green is the 'old' graveyard, which is accessible to the public and conveys the history of the village. The village extends out the Irvinestown road and at the cross can be found the post office, further out there is another group of houses called Armstrong villas. In 2008 the village got a 30 mph speed limit which pleased many of the residents, especially those with young children who walk to school. The local church is the Church of Ireland with a graveyard surrounding it. On the other side of road is the village hall. The Coming of the Railways Kilskeery is near Bundoran Junction railway station which was the junction of the Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway and the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway. The Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway opened from on the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway near Kilskeery, Co. Tyrone to Pettigo on 13 June 1866. It was extended Bundoran, Co. Donegal in 1868Hajducki, 1974, maps 6, 7 and intended to continue to but failed to do so. The Great Northern Railway ran the E&BR; from 1876 and took it over in 1896. The Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (SL&NCR;) Company was incorporated in 1875, and its construction started at a junction with the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Enniskillen and proceeded westwards. The E&BR; accepted defeat and in 1878 Parliament passed an Act allowing it to abandon its commitment to extend to Sligo from Bundoran. The SL&NCR; adopted as its company seal a picture of two steam locomotives colliding, with one derailed and the other remaining on the track. This commemorated the SL&NCR;'s success in reaching Sligo (in 1881) and the E&BR;'s failure to do the same.

He started his professional career in 1990 with PDM, for which he won his first professional race, the Grand Prix de Wallonie, in 1992. In 1994, while riding for the Dutch TVM team, he developed heart rhythm impairments and returned to ride at amateur level. The following year in Colombia he won the amateur world championship. He was the last amateur world champion, the UCI replacing the race with a youth competition in 1996. The triumph lead to Nelissen being voted as 1995 Dutch Sportsman of the year. According to Nelissen, his use of a power meter was key to his win: he claimed that he was one of the few riders \\"(who) had them and knew what they could do\\" at that time, alongside Greg LeMond and Jonathan Vaughters. All three riders shared the same coach, Adrie Van Diemen. He prepared for the race by tackling the hardest climb on the finishing circuit in a variety of ways to find the tactic which would enable him to complete the climb fastest, settling on riding it at a steady tempo. During the race he was able to use this tactic to catch up to the other riders in the winning break after being dropped by them at the start of the climb. He made his winning break just over a lap from the finish, attacking on a descent and soloing to the finish. He was brought into the Rabobank team for two years under manager Jan Raas. In the 1996 Tour de France, he wore the polka dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification for a couple of days.

It has a wide distribution in the oceans of the southern hemisphere. It is commercially important as a food fish. Description Pentaceros richardsoni is a large armourhead with quite a large head and a moderately deep body which is laterally compressed and slightly rounded. The head is largely covered in finely marked bones which are rough to the touch. It has a straight snout which becomes rounded and bulbous in mature adults. The small mouth is slightly angled upwards and has jaws armed with narrow bands of short, moderately curved teeth and there are teeth on the roof of the mouth. The body is covered on small, ctenoid rough scales which form small polygonal plates which interlock on the throat and abdomen. The lateral line is high up on the flanks and its for parallels the dorsal profile. The dorsal fin contains 14‚Äì15 spines and 8‚Äì9 soft rays and is continuous and long based. The spines at the head end increases in length and thickness with the fourth spine being the longest and most robust, the spines the decrease in length and thickness. The soft rays are taller than the ultimate dorsal spines. The anal fin has a short base, sits opposite the soft part of the dorsal fin and is similar in form to it, it has 4‚Äì5 spines and 8‚Äì9 soft rays. The caudal fin is a little bit emarginate. The colouration of this species is that it is iridescent dark blue dorsally and silvery-grey on the flanks and the underside. This species attains a maximum total length of .

Taxonomy Pentaceros richardsoni was first formally described in 1844 by the Scots surgeon, explorer, ethnologist and zoologist Andrew Smith (1797‚Äì1872) with the type locality given as Cape Point, South Africa. For a long time it was placed in the genus Pseudopentaceros but examination of skeletal and musculature has led to Pseudopentaceros being considered a junior synonym of Pentaceros. The specific name honours the naval surgeon, naturalist and arctic explorer Sir John Richardson.
