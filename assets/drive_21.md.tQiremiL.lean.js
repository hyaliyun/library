The three-story urban-style shopping mall once had 70 shops but was down to 54 retailers when Hudson Pacific announced plans to convert most of the site to offices. It has been renamed One Westside as it is transformed into offices for Google. It is owned and operated by Hudson Pacific Properties, which is acting as landlord and developer in a joint venture with previous owner The Macerich Company to transform the mall from retail to media and technology company offices. The former Macy's department store will be converted into a center for tech and entertainment tenants called West End. It is separately owned by GPI Cos. A 12-screen movie theater owned by the Landmark Theatres company, which opened in 2007 as the flagship location for the company will remain. The Interior area of the mall closed in 2019. History The site was originally occupied by a mini mall known as Westland and a free-standing May Company building that was later incorporated into the mall. Part of the mall also occupied the site of the Pico Drive-in movie theater - which was located there from 1934 to 1950 - and is considered only the fourth drive-in in the United States, and the first in California. The Westside Pavilion was developed by the Australian Westfield Group.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-05-26-re-6089-story.html It was designed by The Jerde Partnership, the coordinating architectural firm of the 1984 Olympic Games, with a bold modern design of orange, lavender and green accent colors in geometrical shapes, evoking a Parisian shop-lined street. The mall connected an existing May Co. department store at Pico and Overland with a brand new Nordstrom anchor store at Westwood and Overland. It was constructed at a cost of $90 million, and opened on May 31, 1985.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-05-26-re-6089-story.html The first A√©ropostale clothing store opened at the mall in 1987. The plans to build the mall caused an uproar from the surrounding community over concerns of increased traffic and parking on the street. The community responded by banning street parking to non-residents and the developers agreed to provide adequate parking within the mall, as well as retain the Vons supermarket that existed in the previous shopping center. The mall quickly became a Westside landmark. Westside Pavilion Interior, 2008 There was a plan to build a massive movie theater complex on the opposite side of Westwood Boulevard from the mall in 1986. That plan eventually evolved into an expansion of the mall, designed by the mall's original architect, Jon Jerde, which included new shops and al fresco restaurants all connected to the rest of the mall by a bridge over Westwood. The addition to the Westside Pavilion opened in 1991 despite criticism from many, including Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, The addition, officially known as \\"Westside Too\\", opened up with great fanfare and was very popular for the first couple of years, but its popularity soon began to decline as clients favored the original part of the mall. By the late 1990s only a few shops and restaurants remained open in Westside Too, and the only major features remaining were the Barnes & Noble bookstore (which opened in 1995 in the space of three floors covering four previous shops) and the 1,000 parking spaces it had added. Most of Westside Too still had the dated early-1990s decor on the abandoned storefronts. Agencies serving the community, such as the West L.A. Chamber of Commerce and an infant and toddler gym, soon took over some of these spaces. The original part of the mall was renovated in 2000 with the installation of carpeted seating areas and German limestone flooring to give it a more contemporary and upscale look. Westside Too remained open until January 2006, when it was closed to make way for a 12-screen Landmark movie theater and new restaurants. The new addition opened in June 2007; Barnes and Noble was the only store from Westside Too that remained in the new addition. (The bookstore was closed for the duration of the renovations, but was not itself renovated.) The new addition complex, which was designed by the architectural firms F+A Architects and PleskowRael, features the largest movie theater in the U.S. showing exclusively independent films - with 12-screens and 2,000 total seats. The theater also features Landmark's new \\"Living Room\\" brand auditoriums. The \\"Living Room\\" concept features smaller capacity theaters (30-50 people) with sofas, ottomans, side- tables and other home-like amenities. The theater also features reserved seating and a wine bar. In late 2008, a group of animal rights activists began peaceful protests in Westside Pavilion against a pet store called BarkWorks, which they alleged was a retailer for puppy mills. Macerich restricted the protesters to the pedestrian bridge over Westwood Boulevard and prohibited them from protesting on certain blackout days. The protesters conformed their conduct to Macerich's restrictions, but also filed a lawsuit to enjoin Macerich from enforcing them. On March 2, 2011, the California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District ruled that the trial court had erred in denying the protesters' motion for a preliminary injunction. The appellate court held that Macerich's restrictions (blackout days and not protesting directly in front of the targeted tenant) were unreasonable as a matter of law, and reversed and remanded for further proceedings.Best Friends Animal Society v. Macerich Westside Pavilion Property LLC, 193 Cal. App. 4th 168 (2011). The lawsuit was settled in November 2011. =Decline= In early 2015, Nordstrom announced it would relocate its Westside Pavilion store to Westfield Century City, a competing shopping center less than two miles away. The relocation took place in 2017.http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/nordstrom-announces-relocation-of-westside-pavillion-store-to- westfield-century-city-300040539.html On October 27, 2017, it was announced that Macy's would be closing in March 2018. On January 10, 2019, Macy's announced that the Macy's Furniture Gallery would also be closing as part of a plan to close 8 stores nationwide. The store closed in March 2019. , the movie theater remains open for business. =Transformation= In early 2018, Macerich announced a joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties in which most of the retail space within the three-story enclosed structure would be converted into office spaces for media and technology companies. Hudson Pacific Properties plans to redevelop the mall into \\"One Westside\\", a new office complex for Google that is planned to be opened in 2022. It is anticipated to occupy and cost $410 million to renovate. After the conversion, the Westside Tavern restaurant and the 12-screen Landmark Theater multiplex will remain open to the public. The former Macy's department store will be converted into a center for tech and entertainment tenants called West End. The of office space, owned by GPI Cos., will be designed by HLW Architects. Macerich will retain 25% ownership in the repurposed property. Hudson Pacific Properties will manage the property and also act as developer. Google will be the sole tenant. Popular culture Westside Pavilion has been used for music videos and motion pictures. The mall scenes in Tom Petty's video for \\"Free Fallin'\\" were filmed here, while its exterior was featured in the film Clueless. Howie Mandel visited this mall during an episode of Deal or No Deal to pick a contestant at random.

Fishing from boats and the bank is popular, and common species include striped bass, walleye, pickerel, carp, largemouth and smallmouth bass, muskellunge, and catfish. The water is stained by vegetation and has a very faint current, since the lake is part of the course of Tohickon Creek. It is also fed by two other creeks known as Haycock Run and Three Mile Run.Official DCNR map of Nockamixon State Park Accessed March 8, 2010.

Water is released from the dam (assuming the reservoir has enough water) on the 3rd full weekend of March and the first full weekend of November to facilitate whitewater paddling on Tohickon Creek. The releases provide enough water to paddle all of the creek, from below the dam to confluence with the Delaware River. The most popular section is the last 3 miles, from Ralph Stover State Park to the Delaware River. Releases are timed to provide sufficient flows in that section from about 9 AM until 4 PM on both Saturday and Sunday.Nockamixon State Park Accessed May 8, 2012American Whitewater River Database, Tohickon Creek.

Goddard, for recreational uses. It was originally to be called Tohickon Lake, after the creek, but its name was later changed to Nockamixon, meaning \\"place of soft soil\\" in the Lenape language. The park today contains several historic Native American sites. Following its proposal in 1958, the dam was built by the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters.

Jan Bervida (4 September 1893 in Radkov, district T√°bor - 26 January 1962 in New York, USA). Residence: United States of America, 1948‚Äì1962. Head of department of Czechoslovakian Civilian Airways (1929‚Äì38 and also 1945‚Äì47). Vice president of ICAO and FAI. Member of ICAN and the Council of Free Czechoslovakia.  Biography  After finishing secondary school in T√°bor he began studying at the Imperial-Royal Technical University (now ƒåVUT) in Prague. In 1914, during the 1st World War, he was sent to Eastern Front and 1915 Bervida was taken prisoner by Russians, and later as a private of the Czechoslovak Legion he took part in a march to the United States via Vladivostok. Upon returning to his home country he graduated from the University of Technology, receiving an MA (Ing.) in Aeronautic Engineering. = Public Works Ministry = In 1927‚Äì29 he worked at the Public Works Ministry in Prague, where he became Head of the Aviation Department in 1929. By some sources short time before the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Army of the Nazi Germany in 1938, President Edvard Bene≈° promoted him to Army General in Reserve. There is not any remark in Czech military archives about it. = The Nazi Occupation 1939‚Äì1945 = During the Nazi Occupation of Czechoslovakia from 1939 to 1945, Bervida, as a former member of Czechoslovak Legion, was fired in 1939 and became a teacher. He taught at a secondary school specializing in engineering. Later he was arrested and interrogated. Because he collaborated with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London, he was sentenced to death. He was saved by the end of World War II in May 1945. = Post-war = In 1945‚Äì47, Bervida became Department Head at the Ministry of Transport (Civilian Airways) and Czechoslovak Airlines (ƒåSA) Director. In 1946 was Bervida elected vice president of the FAI and one year later 1947 was he elected vice president to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). He was unjustly charged in a court case brought against him, but the case was dropped after the intervention of President Edvard Bene≈°. During Communist takeover in 1948 he was in France, where applied for citizenship. In Paris he was involved with Czechoslovak exile authorities (Council of Free Czechoslovakia). Shortly thereafter he emigrated to the United States, where he worked with the ICAO in New York and in Montreal.

To be cross-listed, a company must thus comply with the requirements of all the stock exchanges in which it is listed, such as filing. Cross-listing should not be confused with other methods that allow a company's stock to be traded in two different exchanges, such as: * Dual listed companies, where two distinct companies (with separate stocks listed on different exchanges) function as one company. * Depository receipts, which are only a representation of the stock, issued by a third-party bank rather than by the company itself. However, in practice the two terms are often used interchangeably. * Admitted for trading, where a foreign share is accessible in a different market through an exchange convention and not actually registered within that different market. Generally such a company's primary listing is on a stock exchange in its country of incorporation, and its secondary listing(s) is/are on an exchange in another country. Cross-listing is especially common for companies that started out in a small market but grew into a larger market. For example, numerous large non-U.S. companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ as well as on their respective national exchanges such as Enbridge, BlackBerry Ltd, Statoil, Ericsson, Nokia, Toyota and Sony. Difference with Depository Receipts Depository Receipts (DR) are instruments derived from another underlying instrument while Multi- listed instruments represent the actual stock of a company. DR are convertible back to ordinary shares, following a process dependent upon the sponsoring facility that created the instrument. Ownership of a DR does not convey the same rights as a direct holder of equity shares, but in most cases the DR is convertible back into the original instrument through a process of conversion. The DR receive a different ISIN number, recognizing that they are not the same fungible instrument as the underlying stock. Popular DR include American Depositary Receipts (ADR), European Depositary Receipts (EDR), global depository receipts (GDR, also referred to as international depository receipts), and Global Registered Shares (GRS). Multi listed or cross-listed shares, by contrast, are technically the same financial instrument. Fungibility is a concern across markets. For example, shares of IBM cannot be purchased on NYSE and sold, same-day, on the London Stock Exchange, even though IBM is cross listed in both markets. There is a re-registration process that must occur to move the number of outstanding shares from one jurisdiction to the other. This is primarily due to market inefficiencies and structures required to maintain the integrity of registered shares within specific jurisdictions (typically regulatory driven). When a company decides to cross- list, the stock is technically fungible between exchanges. Royal Dutch Shell, IBM, and Siemens are all examples where the same issue is traded in multiple markets. However, in Frankfurt and Paris, they are traded in EUR, London in GBP, and on NYSE in USD. Prices are subject to local market conditions, as well as FX fluctuations and are not kept in perfect parity between markets. They tend to be more liquid than ADRs, GDRs and those types of conventions. While 'technically' fungible, these separate primary listings (they would all be considered 'primary' listings) are subject to re-registration which creates significant settlement risk if an investor wants to buy on one exchange and sell in another (especially where the currencies differ). Difference with Admitted for Trading Shares traded in a true cross listing / multi listed scenario are processed, matched and settled via the market mechanisms specific to the local exchange. In this regard, even though shares of IBM bought on NYSE and shares of IBM purchased on LSE are technically the same instrument, those purchased on NYSE will settle via the mechanisms associated with NYSE and the DTCC in the United States. Those shares purchased on the LSE will settle via the mechanisms of the LSE and CREST in the United Kingdom. Shares 'admitted for trading', such as IBM listed via ARCA in Frankfurt, will settle via DTCC. It is important to note that IBM is also cross-listed in Frankfurt, in which case, those transactions will settle via the local German market processes. Motivations for Cross-Listing The academic literature has identified a number of different arguments to cross-list abroad in addition to a listing on the domestic exchange. Roosenboom and Van Dijk (2009) distinguish between the following motivations: * Market segmentation: The traditional argument for why firms seek a cross-listing is that they expect to benefit from a lower cost of capital that arises because their shares become more accessible to global investors whose access would otherwise be restricted because of international investment barriers. * Market liquidity: Cross- listings on deeper and more liquid equity markets could lead to an increase in the liquidity of the stock and a decrease in the cost of capital. * Information disclosure: Cross-listing on a foreign market can reduce the cost of capital through an improvement of the firm's information environment. Firms can use a cross-listing on markets with stringent disclosure requirements to signal their quality to outside investors and to provide improved information to potential customers and suppliers (for example, by adopting US GAAP). Also, cross-listings tend to be associated with increased media attention, greater analyst coverage, better analysts‚Äô forecast accuracy, and higher quality of accounting information. * Investor protection (\\"bonding\\"): Recently, there is a growing academic literature on the so-called \\"bonding\\" argument. According to this view, cross-listing in the United States acts as a bonding mechanism used by firms that are incorporated in a jurisdiction with poor investor protection and enforcement systems to commit themselves voluntarily to higher standards of corporate governance. In this way, firms attract investors who would otherwise be reluctant to invest. * Other motivations: Cross-listing may also be driven by product and labor market considerations (for example, to increase visibility with customers by broadening product identification), to facilitate foreign acquisitions, and to improve labor relations in foreign countries by introducing share and option plans for foreign employees. Costs of cross-listing There are, however, also disadvantages in deciding to cross-list: increased pressure on executives due to closer public scrutiny; increased reporting and disclosure requirements; additional scrutiny by analysts in advanced market economies, and additional listing fees. Some financial media have argued that the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley act in the United States has made the NYSE less attractive for cross-listings, but recent academic research finds little evidence to support this, see Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2007). Value creation of cross-listings There is a vast academic literature on the impact of cross-listings on the value of the cross-listed firms. Most studies (for example, Miller, 1999) find that a cross-listing on a U.S. stock market by a non-U.S. firm is associated with a significantly positive stock price reaction in the home market.Miller, Darius, 1999, The market reaction to international cross-listings: Evidence from depositary receipts. Journal of Financial Economics 51, 103-123. This finding suggests that the stock market expects the cross-listing to have a positive impact on firm value. Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) show that companies with a cross-listing in the United States have a higher valuation than non- cross-listed corporations, especially for firms with high growth opportunities domiciled in countries with relatively weak investor protection. The premium they find is larger for companies listed at official US stock exchanges (Level II and III ADR programs) than for over-the-counter listings (Level I ADR program) and private placements (Rule 144A ADR's). Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) argue that a cross-listing in the United States reduces the extent to which controlling shareholders can engage in expropriation (through \\"bonding\\" to the high corporate governance standards in the United States) and thereby increases the firm's ability to take advantage of growth opportunities. Recent research, shows that the listing premium for crosslisting has evaporated, due to new U.S. regulations and competition from other exchanges. Some recent academic research finds that smaller foreign firms seeking cross listing venues may be opting for UK exchanges over U.S. exchanges due to the costs imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On the other hand, larger firms seeking \\"bonding\\" benefits from a U.S. listing continue to seek a U.S. exchange listing. There are also studies, however, such as Sarkissian and Schill (2009), who argue that cross-listings do not create long-term valuation benefits. The academic literature largely ignores cross-listings on non-U.S. exchanges. However, there are many cross-listings on exchanges in Europe and Asia. Even U.S. firms are cross-listed in other countries. In the 1950s there was a wave of cross-listings of U.S. firms in Belgium, in the 1960s in France, in the 1970s in the U.K., and in the 1980s in Japan (see Sarkissian and Schill, 2014). Roosenboom and van Dijk (2009) analyze 526 cross-listings from 44 different countries on 8 major stock exchanges and document significant stock price reactions of 1.3% on average for cross-listings on US exchanges, 1.1% on London Stock Exchange, 0.6% on exchanges in continental Europe, and 0.5% on Tokyo Stock Exchange. These findings suggest that cross-listings on Anglo-Saxon exchanges create more value than on other exchanges. They also highlight the incomplete understanding of why firms cross-list outside the UK and the United States, as many of the arguments discussed above (enhanced liquidity, improved disclosure, and bonding) do not apply. In this respect, Sarkissian and Schill (2014) show that cross-listing activity in a given host country coincides with the outperformance of host and proximate home country's economies and financial markets, thus, highlighting the market timing component in cross-listing decisions.

The species is poorly studiedMolecular, morphological, and physiological evolution in South Pacific scincid lizards. Austin, Christopher Cowell, Ph.D., The University of Texas at Austin, 1995, 213 pages; AAT 9603793 and the species' risk of extinction has not been evaluated by the World Conservation Union, and does not appear in any CITES appendix. The skink has developed setae on its toe pads (or digit pads) for climbing analogous to those of geckos and anoles, but the trait is believed to have evolved independently to these groups, so is an example of convergent evolution. With regards to the trait, other species in the genus, P. flavipes and P. prehensicauda, have the primitive character, and lack the setae. Other skinks within the genus Lipinia have also evolved toe pad setae, and within the skink family, four morphologically distinct adhesive microstructures have evolved, possibly all with independent evolutionary origins. By contrast, anoles and geckos each use a single, common structure, although it appears to have evolved independently in the two groups. As in other lizards of the genus Prasinohaema, the blood of P. virens is green, rather than the usual red coloration of most vertebrates. The green blood pigmentation results in a strikingly bright lime-green coloration of muscles, bones, tongue, and mucosal tissue, and is the result of the accumulation of the bile pigment biliverdin in levels that would be toxic in all other vertebrates. Biliverdin is formed from the breakdown of hemoglobin, and is normally converted to bilirubin. However, mutation in various genes regulating bilirubin formation is believed to lead to the formation and accumulation of high levels of biliverdin. It is speculated that the high biliverdin concentration protects against malaria.  Import to Australia  In Australia, Importing this skink is prohibited under State and Territory legislation because the skink's risk as an invasive species has not yet been assessed.Vertebrate Pests Committee, List of Exotic Vertebrate Animals in Australia, Revised January 2006 However, live specimens may be imported with a permit issued under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 for noncommercial purposes, such as research, but not as a household pet.List of Specimens taken to be Suitable for Live Import. Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Last updated 23 October 2006.  Geographic specifications  This species of prasinohaema is native to Papau New Guinea in southeast Asia. P. virens were named after their discovery in the late 19th century by the German zoologist Wilhelm Peters. The species resides across the New Guinean and Solomon Islands in altitudes ranging from sea level to 500m. P. virens inhabit lowland rainforest and plantations of different varieties. The high accumulation of biliverdin in this species blood makes it the only genus known to possess green blood in all of Asia. Due to the abundant rainforest and agrarianism, the species currently faces no clear threats to its habitat.

Lane's career began to take shape in the mid-1970s, after beginning to record for her husband's record label. Her first singles, \\"Trying to Forget About You\\" and \\"Sweet Deceiver\\", were released in 1977 followed by \\"Let Me Down Easy\\", her first major hit, by the end of the year. After having a series of Top 10 and 20 country hits, she signed with United Artists Records, and had her biggest hit with \\"One Day at a Time\\", a gospel song, that peaked at No. 1 on the country charts. Early life On January 8, 1940, Cristy Lane was born Eleanor Johnston to a family of twelve in Peoria, Illinois. Married to Lee Stoller before she was 20 years old, Lane had three children by 1964. Her husband heard her singing in the kitchen one day and encouraged her to sing professionally. Unfortunately, Lane was painfully shy. After a few tentative attempts and several nightclub appearances, she finally landed a guest slot on the Barn Dance radio program on Chicago's WGN in 1968. Chicago proved to be inspirational, as it was from Chicago DJ Chris Lane that she took her stage name. Music career =Early music career= Several early attempts to break into Nashville's country scene ended in disappointment, and Lane was struggling with the pressures of the performing career her husband was urging upon her. In 1969, Stoller organized a 120-show tour of Vietnam which resulted in a helicopter crash, leaving Lane stranded in the midst of a battle. After her harrowing experiences in Vietnam, Lane lost all hope of a jet-setting music career. She and her husband returned to Peoria and opened a pair of nightclubs featuring Lane as the marquee attraction. However, by 1972, Lane and her family had moved to a Nashville suburb to attempt once more to get her career off the ground. Lane was largely met with indifference from label executives, prompting her husband to form LS Records, his own label, in the mid-1970s. =Breakthrough success: 1977-1981= After Stoller continuously promoted Lane's singles, the songs \\"Tryin' to Forget About You\\" and \\"Sweet Deceiver\\" charted in 1977. Her next single, titled \\"Let Me Down Easy\\", was chosen as the background music for a national news story on a balloon festival. Although the exposure was limited, it brought enough attention for the song to peak in the top 10 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs, reaching No. 7\\\\. Her singles \\"Shake Me I Rattle\\" and \\"Penny Arcade\\" were top 20 and top 10 hits respectively. That year, LS released her debut album, Cristy Lane Is the Name, which included all three of the hit singles. In 1979, Lane signed with United Artists Records and performed at the Academy of Country Music Awards, singing \\"I Just Can't Stay Married to You\\", and she won the award for Top New Female Vocalist that night. The national exposure from the performance helped gain her an increase of radio airplay and an increase in record sales, bringing the song to No. 5 on the Billboard Country Chart. She released Simple Little Words, her third studio album, in 1979, after signing the contract with United Artists. Its title track reached the top 10, and the album's two additional singles \\"Come to My Love\\" and \\"Slippin' up, Slippin' Around\\" peaked in the top 20. The next year, United Artists balked at releasing her next single \\"One Day at a Time\\", written by Kris Kristofferson and Marijohn Wilkin, which was previously a country hit by Marilyn Sellars. Before Lane's release of the song, Lena Martell had a No. 1 hit in the United Kingdom with her version. Stoller predicted the song would have a successful impact on the charts, and decided that Lane's version would be released in early 1980. \\"One Day at a Time\\" became Lane's biggest hit, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart. The single's follow-up, \\"Sweet Sexy Eyes\\", made the country top 10 the same year, becoming her final entry in the Top 10. She had a top 20 hit in 1981 with a cover of ABBA's \\"I Have a Dream\\", followed by a top 25 hit with \\"Love to Love You\\" from the same album. While serving eight months of a three-year prison sentence on bribery charges, Stoller collaborated with Pete Chaney to write Lane's biography. The book was published and self-promoted on television. The biography, also titled One Day at a Time, was sold in large amounts after being promoted. Stoller promoted more of Lane's music and material on television in the mid-1980s, releasing new compilation albums along with the book, and her revenues greatly increased, as high as ten to one. Lane's material was soon promoted constantly on television and eventually sold on the world wide web in the 1990s, helping her record sales increase worldwide. =Later career: 1981 - present= In the late 1980s, Lane opened her own theater in Branson, Missouri, called The Cristy Lane Theatre, which helped revive her career. In 1989, she also performed at the Hershey Park Amphitheatre in Pennsylvania, and also recorded a version of \\"Lean on Me\\" with Michael Jackson, Terri Gibbs, and Tom T. Hall for Willie Nelson's Farm Aid Benefit. Lane rented her theater in Branson into the 1990s, continuing to perform local concerts around the Branson area. However, in 1995, she was injured after falling from the top of the stage of the Jim Stafford Theatre where she was performing, temporarily suspending her music career. She then sold her theater, and later began performing again. In the early 1990s, she released many compilation albums, including 20 Greatest Hits. Although it did not contain many of Lane's hits, it did garner positive reviews. Throughout the 1990s, she continued releasing more compilation albums, including releases such as Greatest Hits off the LS label, which included many of Lane's biggest hits as well as covers of other songs, including Christian and country music songs. The Greatest Hits album was given a positive review. In August 2003, she was honored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars in San Antonio, Texas for her recognition to the military, and was inducted into its hall of fame.

In the , Lota recorded a population of 3,256 people.  Geography  Lota is east of the CBD. The south and east of the suburb is dominated by the mudflats and mangrove wetlands of Lota Creek and Waterloo Bay. To the west and north, the land rises towards the heights of Manly and Manly West. The suburb is of primarily post-war residential make-up but is gradually being developed with modern beachside properties. History Lota, near the foreshore, circa 1935 This part of Moreton Bay was originally occupied by the semi-nomadic Mipirimm subclan of the Quandamooka people. Lota and neighbouring suburb Manly were and continue to be known as Narlung to the Quandamooka peopleQuandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation. 2018.

The name ningi ningi (meaning 'oysters') may also have been used in relation to the area of Lota near the creek. Lota was acquired by Irish-born politician and pastoralist William Duckett White in 1860, following sub-division of the lands from Lytton to Fig Tree Point. The first Queensland Premier, Robert Herbert, entered into a partnership with Duckett White for some of the land. The suburb is named after Duckett White's residence, Lota House, built in 1863.Myrtle Beitz (2005) Mangroves to Moorings Revisited: A History of the Wynnum, Manly and Lota District Lota House was the heart of a productive estate, with sugar cane and fodder grown on the flats near the creek and orchards planted on higher ground near Macdonald Street. Aboriginal and South Sea Islander people worked the property, camping to the west of Lota House. Other major Quandamooka campsites in the area in the mid-1800s were located in Manly and Wynnum. Duckett White's land was first subdivided in 1911 to the east of the present railway line. The Lota Park Estate, west of the line, was sold in 1918. Lota School of Arts opened on the corner of Alexander and MacDonald Streets in 1927, and played host to dance evenings, film screenings and classes. The Rix-Farmer Memorial Presbyterian Church opened in opposite Lota House Oceana Terrace in 1931. The same year, Great Depression 'relief work' led to the reclamation of land along the Esplanade, and the building of Lota's seawall. The former St Agnes' Anglican Church on The Esplanade (near Orallo Street, approx ) was dedicated on 16 May 1957 by Archbishop Halse. Its closure was approved on 21 January 1994 by Assistant Bishop Ron Williams. The building was moved to Alexandra Hills Parish. In the , Lota recorded a population of 3,255 people.

It was introduced in the mid-1970s, after the British Army's universal adoption of DPM field clothing. While the design was little different from the Denison smock, it was made from a lighter-weight cloth, printed in the then standard Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM). The Para Smock differs from the three most recent standard patterns of combat jacket, all made from DPM, and is like its Denison predecessor in having no flap to button or velcro over the full length zipper; hip and breast pockets; hem adjustors; and a diaper flap (fastened under the crotch to stop the smock riding up while parachuting) fastened by pres-studs (snaps) (though smaller than on the Denison); and knitted wool cuffs. It is also cut more loosely than the Smock,combat. It lacks the flannel lining on the inside of the collar that the Denison had, and like the standard Smock, combat has a first field dressing pouch on one sleeve (the right), and pen pockets on the other, both closed by buttoned flaps. Like the 1968 Pattern Smock, Combat, it is fitted with three buttons around the outside of the collar, to which a hood can be attached. The hood is DPM, and lined in green. (One is visible in the photograph shown). The Para Smock is standard issue for the Parachute Regiment and other airborne units. With the introduction of the British Army's latest \\"Multi-Terrain Pattern\\" camouflage (MTP), the Para Smock also became available in that pattern and remains on issue with the Parachute Regiment and other airborne units. Outside of airborne units, it is highly sought after not only for its physical qualities, but also as something of a status symbol.

Most electronic bagpipe emulators feature a simulated chanter, which is used to play the melody. Some models also produce a harmonizing drone(s). Some variants employ a simulated bag, wherein the player's pressure on the bag activates a switch maintaining a constant tone. As with other electronic musical instruments, they must be plugged into an instrument amplifier and loudspeaker (or headphones) to hear the sound. Some electronic bagpipes are MIDI controllers that can be plugged into a synth module to create synthesized or sampled bagpipe sounds. Electronic bagpipes are produced to replicate various types of bagpipes from around the world, including the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe (also known as piob mhor), Irish uilleann pipes, Galician gaita, French cornemuse, Italian zampogna and Swedish s√§ckpipa. They have gone from being a rare curiosity to a widely used instrument used for practice, and even performance, by both amateur and professional players. History Hevia and his electronic Asturian bagpipe Electronic bagpipes have been attested as early as 1962, when The Electronic Musical Instrument Manual noted the existence of electronic bagpipes using transistors, caveating: \\" but there is only one commercial musical instrument on the market and it would seem reasonable to wait for the elimination of some of the less desirable features of transistors...\\" In the late 1970s, the late Bazzell Ray Cowan of Austin, Texas, an electronics engineer and piper, developed the first practical electronic bagpipe with an authentic pipe sound, which he called the Bazpipe. According to Mr. Cowan (in an interview in 1993), the project had originally been in response to a bet with another piper at a wedding. The original version consisted of a chanter (the melody pipe) utilizing gold-plated metal contacts, which in turn were connected to a motherboard, transistors and a speaker, powered by a 6 volt lantern battery, all housed in an extruded plastic \\"bag\\" the size and shape of a regular bagpipe bag. Eventually, with the advance of technology, he was able to downsize it, till by the early 1990s, it consisted of a chanter topped with a 6 x 4 inch plastic box which housed all the components, including a 2-inch speaker, all powered by a 9 volt battery. By his death in 1996, it had become one of a well-known devices of the genre. Many of the later electronic pipes would be modeled on the Bazpipe. Another pioneer was George H. Boyd, whose system, although not as easily portable as the Bazpipe, produced an authentic \\"bagpipe\\" sound. Boyd also developed the first electronic uilleann (Irish) bagpipe, but only made one prototype. A range of publications through the 1980s discussed such electronic piping developments, and in 1981 the company Keltronics advertised what they claimed to be \\"the world's first electronic bagpipes\\". However, as can be seen from the dates, Cowan's device (and others) pre-dated not only Keltronics, but most other devices. Other interesting developments included the Ross Technologies Programmable Electronic Bagpipes, which, though looking similar to the Bazpipe, was capable of playing in different keys in order to accompany different instruments. Their second generation model, could not only emulate the Scottish bagpipe and play harmonies, but could emulate other instruments as well. Later models included the MicroPipes, which are a headphones-only electronic practice chanter, and the MidiPipes featuring realistic wavetable sound and MIDI output capability. Later commercial developments included the work of Anders Fagerstr√∂m, who in 1991 manufacturing a Scottish Highland practice chanter emulator, and later developed a \\"full\\" set electronic pipes emulation. Fagerstrom also produces emulators of the Galician bagpipe and Swedish s√§ckpipa. Manfred Deger of Germany developed an interesting Scottish Highland pipe emulator with MIDI, and has since expanded its capabilities. In the early 1990s a multidisciplinary team composed of Alberto Arias, Miguel Dopico and Jos√© √Ångel Hevia patented the first electronic bagpipe in history. Hevia‚Äôs CD ‚ÄúNo Man‚Äôs Land‚Äù was released in 1998 and more than two million copies were sold worldwide. Since then the electronic bagpipe has established itself as a versatile tool in the new musical discourse of European bagpipe playing. A similar development with a pressure-sensitive bag was copied In 2005 the German Rolf Jost, and has since been produced under the brand-name redpipes, in varieties emulating various bagpipes. Another innovation, developed by Ram√≥n M Castro and Jos√© Antonio Garc√≠a, is the vPipes, an Irish uilleann pipes emulator with remarkable capabilities, including the ability to make the caoine (\\"cry\\" - a slurring, note-bending finger movement which produces a sound characteristic of Irish music). It does not use the General MIDI, instead it uses Emulation Mode, a proprietary interface developed by the vPipes team. There is also an electronic bagpipe instrument called Master Gaita, artisanally created under demand by Jos√© J. Presedo, which has been in development for more than a decade spawning several iterations, and currently consists of a bagpipe chanter attached to a cushioned bag which contains a USB connector (which creates a MIDI device in the computer) and, optionally, a MIDI connector which can be used to connect a wireless MIDI transmitter stored inside the bag so the instrument works completely wirelessly. There have also been a number of software programs that have emulated bagpipes using a computer and MIDI interface, as well as computer-based bagpipe music reading and writing programs. Other recent developments have been made by Michael Eskin, a programmer and piper in California, who has developed several virtual instrument emulator apps for the iPad and iPhone. Among these are bagpipes (including Scottish Highland and smallpipes, Irish uilleann pipes, and Swedish s√§ckpipa), as well as a set of regulators for the iPad which can be played in concert with the uilleann pipe apps. He also produces concertina and accordion apps. In 2016, a new kind of electronic bagpipes, based on optical fingering detection have been introduced : the 'a-pipes'. There are also some Open Source approaches to electronic bagpipes like the eChanter or the OpenPipe http://www.openpipe.cc project. Both of them take advantage of the widely spread Arduino board and facilitate people with some technical skills to build and customise their own electronic bagpipes. Most of the modern versions incorporate MIDI capabilities, and have built-in interfaces. Players The first adopter of the electronic bagpipe as a performance instrument was Hevia. Hevia‚Äôs CD ‚ÄúNo Man‚Äôs Land‚Äù was released in 1998 and more than two million copies were sold worldwide. Since then the electronic bagpipe has established itself as a versatile tool in the new musical discourse of European bagpipe playing. The original instruments were seen mainly as curiosities, or at most, as practice instruments. However, they were eventually adopted by some of the best players in the world. One early adopter was James McColl, among the most noted senior Scottish pipers. He still uses an early Boyd pipe for practice and demonstrations. Another early adopter of the electronic bagpipe as a performance instrument was Sean Folsom (formerly of the California-based Celtic group, Shiela na Gig) who incorporated a Bazpipe in his wide-ranging exhibition of world bagpipes and other instruments in the early 1990s. Folsom introduced the Bazpipe to a fellow piper, who immediately saw the potential, and subsequently incorporated it in performances with his group and on their recording. Doubtless others were doing the same thing, as their use is now widespread. Bands and musicians now playing electronic bagpipes include Korn, Ithilien, Eluveitie, Gaelic Storm, Red Hot Chilli Pipers, Seer, Hevia, Nightwish, and The Wiggles.

This early Muromachi period Japanization was based upon the circa 543 CE Chinese Yupian (ÁéâÁØá \\"Jade Chapters\\"), as available in the 1013 CE Daguang yihui Yupian (Â§ßÂª£ÁõäÊúÉÁéâÁØá; \\"Enlarged and Expanded Yupian\\"). The date and compiler of the Wagokuhen are uncertain. Since the oldest extant editions of 1489 and 1491 CE are from the Entoku era, that may approximate the time of original compilation. The title was later written ÂíåÁéâÁØá with the graphic variant wa Âíå \\"harmony; Japan\\" for wa ÂÄ≠ \\"dwarf; Japan\\". Internal collation is through Chinese character radicals. Each head kanji entry gives katakana annotations for readings in on'yomi Sino-Japanese to the right and native kun'yomi Japanese below the character. There are few definitions and no entries for compounds. This format is similar with the Jiky≈çsh≈´, except that the Wagokuhen does not semantically subdivide characters within a radical division. The Wagokuhen was frequently revised and reprinted, for example, the Sh≈´chin Wagokuhen (Ë¢ñÁèçÂÄ≠ÁéâÁØá \\"Pocket Edition Wagokuhen\\"). Scholars categorize over 51 editions (Chen 1996:281) by the number and arrangement of radicals. While the Yupian has a system of 542 radicals, different Wagokuhen editions have from 100 to 542. Bailey (1960:31) notes that the textual variations are usually divided into four types, depending upon the sequence of the first four radicals in the edition. *Type 1: Those beginning with the radicals Êó• (sun), Êúà (moon), ËÇâ (flesh), ‰∫∫ (person) *Type 2: Those beginning with the radicals Èáë (gold), ‰∫∫ (person), Ë®Ä (speech), ÂøÉ (heart) *Type 3: Those beginning with the radicals ‰∏Ä (one), ‰∏ä (above), Á§∫ (point), ‰∫å (two) *Type 4: Those beginning with the radicals Á§∫ (point), Áéâ (gem), Âúü (earth), Áî∞ (field) The evidence shows that Type 1 was closest to the original Yupian, Type 2 was influenced by the Liao dynasty dictionary Longkan shoujian ÈæçÈæïÊâãÈëë (\\"Hand Mirror for the Dragon Niche\\") with 242 radicals, Type 3 was by the expanded Daguang yihui Yupian, and Type 4 was also influenced by the Daguang and the Japanese Jiky≈çsh≈´.

In 1943, Knoll was approached by Florence Schust, an architect who had studied under Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Eliel Saarinen. Schust convinced Knoll that she could help bring in business to his company even in America's wartime economy by expanding into interior design and working with architects. With her architectural background and design flair, she succeeded. Knoll fell in love with Schust, and in 1946 they were married. At that time, they changed the name of the company to Knoll Associates. In 1943 Knoll assisted the war effort by helping the US Air Force construct the German Village (Dugway proving ground), a simulation of German working class dwellings to be used to perfect fire-bombing techniques on German residential areas. The Knolls determined that, although they were focused on modern design, they would also abide by the values of the Bauhaus: design excellence, technological innovation and mass production. They paid royalties to their designers based on how well the designer's furniture sold, a practice that was innovative at the time. In this way, they were able to attract the design services of Harry Bertoia and Eliel Saarinen. Knoll Associates also acquired the rights to the Barcelona chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In 1945, Knoll launched its Knoll Planning Unit under Florence's direction. She also launched a textiles division in 1947. Knoll moved the firm's headquarters to Pennsylvania in 1950, believing that he would be able to find talented craftsmen among the region's large German population. Knoll's sales force included Irving Blum, who was soon to become Andy Warhol's dealer for the groundbreaking Campbell's Soup Can show at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. Knoll had his Porsche sent to Cuba for a business trip, and died in a car crash with a runaway truck in 1955 at the age of 41. He was survived by his widow Florence who became president of their company and his two children from an earlier marriage, Peter Knoll and Maria (Maja) Knoll.

Fran√ßois Dollier de Casson (1636 ‚Äì 27 September 1701) was born in France into a wealthy bourgeois and military family. He began his adult life in the army which he left after three years to continue his studies and become a priest. After becoming a Sulpician, he was assigned to New France, an assignment he took with some reluctance. He arrived in Quebec in 1666 and was immediately sent as a military chaplain with Prouville de Tracy in an action against the Mohawks.Burton, Clarence M. (1922).

He was active as a missionary and explorer until becoming superior of the Sulpicians in New France in 1671. He also built the first canal. In 1674, Fran√ßois returned to France for an extended rest and served as preceptor to his nephew. He returned to Canada in 1678 and served the Sulpicians until his death. Fran√ßois Dollier de Casson is perhaps best known for his Histoire de Montr√©al. He also contributed to church architecture and served as vicar general of the diocese of Quebec. He ordered the first street survey of Montreal, executed by notary and surveyor B√©nigne Basset Des Lauriers, creating the street layout of what is now known as Old Montreal.

The Bureau's main tasks are to counter and investigate organized crime, provide expert services, and develop methods for criminal investigation. NBI is also responsible for financial intelligence (FININT), such as preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. NBI headquarters has been situated in the city of Vantaa within the Capital Region since 1994 with field offices in Tampere, Turku, Mariehamn, Joensuu, Oulu and Rovaniemi. It is subordinate to the National Police Board under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry.  History  The NBI headquarters in leftThe National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) was established on 30 December 1954 upon ratification of Act 510/1954 and became operational in 1955 by merging the Uusimaa Province Crime Police Centre () and the Crime Research Centre (). Previously, the Crime Police Centre had been handling nationwide investigations while the Crime Research Centre was in charge of intelligence and forensic analyses.Laki keskusrikospoliisista 30.12.1954/510. [Act on the National Bureau of Investigation 30.12.1954/510]. (In Finnish). Kosti Vasa was appointed NBI's first Director and served as such until retiring in 1965. In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, NBI's Finnish Disaster Victim Identification Team (DVI) was dispatched to identify Finnish victims in Thailand. 173 out of the 178 Finns missing in Thailand were eventually identified. In April 2013, NBI came under public pressure after it was revealed that the Bureau had collected mostly indirectly connected information of suspicious persons with possible links to organized crime into a secret intelligence database. Russian president Vladimir Putin was one of the persons recorded after his interaction with the motorcycle club Night Wolves. According to prosecutors, the database was lacking proper controls and vulnerable to unauthorized use. Reporters speculated in the media that having a record in the database could possibly cause financial losses and social exclusion for registered persons‚Äîwho had no means to verify or be aware if they had been recorded. By April 2016, 97.3% of the nearly 50 000 entries had been determined legal and the rest deleted. Robin Lardot started as the Director in October 2013 and initiated an organizational reform by concentrating five of the former departments into three divisions and by reducing leadership positions. The reform was completed on 1 January 2015. Similarly, a new unit targeting cyber crime was established at the Bureau's headquarters in April 2015 with a preliminarily number of 45 staff. The unit's chief named concentrated cyber attacks as Finland's greatest threat at the time. In March 2015, the Bureau opened its first official Twitter account and in August 2015, opened its doors for the first time to the public and allowed visitors to see contents of the Bureau's Crime Museum as well as art forgeries kept inside its headquarters. NBI was in charge of investigating the Turku stabbing of August 2017; considered Finland's first suspected terrorist attack since the end of World War II.  Mandate and organization  = Mandate = NBI's mandate per law is to 1) counter international, organised, professional, financial and other serious crime; 2) investigate aforementioned offences; 3) provide expert services; 4) develop methods for criminal investigation; and 5) perform witness protection.9 ¬ß, Laki poliisin hallinnosta (14.2.1992/110) [Act on Police Administration].

It states that investigates high-profile offences, such as * criminal cases of major importance to the society, such as cybercrime, corruption, securities fraud and environmental crime; * homicides with likely connections to organised crime; and * terrorist offences, unless agreed otherwise with the Finnish Security Intelligence Service. The Bureau states that it engages in different operational activities, such as detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorism financing, taking part in major disaster investigations through the Finnish Disaster Victim Identification Team (DVI), and coordinating combined PCB (Police Customs Border) criminal intelligence organised around the National PCB Criminal Intelligence Centre and the PCB Intelligence Units specialised in air, sea and land traffic. NBI hosts the national centres of Interpol, Europol and Schengen cooperation as well as develops new forensic investigation methods, equipment and material for the police force. = Organization = In the fiscal year 2016, the National Bureau of Investigation's budget was approximately 72.5 million euros. NBI headquarters has been located in the Tikkurila district of Vantaa within the Capital region area since 1994. The Bureau also hosts field offices in Tampere, Turku, Mariehamn, Joensuu, Oulu and Rovaniemi. The headquarters houses the Crime Museum, which holds about 6 000 pieces of criminal history, including tools used in crimes and punishment as well as documents and photos with most of the collections from the 20th century. As of January 2014, NBI has been divided into three divisions in addition to administrative services: * Criminal Investigation Division * Criminal Intelligence Division * Forensic Laboratory The Criminal Investigation Division is further divided into sections on organised crime, homicide, financial crime and information gathering‚Äîand the Criminal Intelligence Division contains a separate section on international affairs as well as a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). NBI had 696 staff, of whom 39% were women, at the end of 2016. Most of the Bureau's personnel serve as law enforcement officers (60%) mainly in investigative and intelligence duties.

Publication history The character first appeared in the story \\"From the Nameless Nowhere Comes... Kaluu!\\" in Strange Tales #147 (August 1966). The first five pages were written by Stan Lee, with Denny O'Neil writing the other half of the story (credited as \\"Our Vacationin' Sorcerer\\" and \\"Our Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", respectively), and Bill Everett provided all the art. Fictional character biography Kaluu was born over five hundred years ago in the mystic city of Kamar-Taj, a village in the Himalayan Mountains. He and the Ancient One became fellow students of the mystic arts. Varnae, the eldest of the true vampires, met with Kaluu and imparted to him knowledge from the primeval compendium of black magic known as the Darkhold. Subsequently, Kaluu set about to make himself ruler of Kamar- Taj. While the Ancient One continued his studies, Kaluu used his sorcery to influence the minds of the people of Kamar-Taj. Eventually, Kaluu and the Ancient One together cast a spell that eliminated disease, poverty, and suffering from Kamar-Taj and granted its people immortality. Shortly thereafter, the people of Kamar-Taj, responding to Kaluu's magical influence on their minds, crowned him as their king. For over a year Kaluu organized the men of Kamar-Taj into an army of conquest. Meanwhile, Kaluu slowly increased his mystic control over the minds of the people of Kamar-Taj so that they become little more than his placid puppets. The Ancient One attempted to warn the people of Kamar-Taj about Kaluu, but Kaluu's magic prevented them from heeding him. Kaluu struck the Ancient One with a magical bolt from behind which paralyzed him. Then Kaluu had his soldiers conquer a neighboring village and reduce it to slavery. Using black magic to control the people of Kamar- Taj, he waged war against the Ancient One, but he summoned a pestilence that almost wiped out the entire population of Kamar-Taj and forced Kaluu to flee to the dimension of Raggador. He emerged from Raggador five centuries later and attempted to steal the Book of the Vishanti. He was defeated by Doctor Strange and hurled into another dimension in suspended animation. The forces unleashed in a battle between Doctor Strange and Urthona eventually freed Kaluu from his imprisonment. When he returned from exile he became a businessman and amassed a large fortune. He formed an alliance with the embattled Doctor Strange, and tutored him in the practice of black magic. Alongside Strange, he battled Shuma-Gorath and various other ancient evils.Strange Tales Vol. 3 #8-10 He also witnessed Doctor Strange's defeat of Shuma-Gorath. Kaluu, Strange, Rintrah, and Enitharmon the Weaver, returned to the Earth dimension where he cast a spell to remove the physical and astral pollution from Strange caused by using black magic.Strange Tales Vol. 3 #14-17 Kaluu plans to live a quiet, enjoyable life, while living off money he made by influencing the stock market. He is seen communicating via crystal ball with the new Ronin (who was actually Blade posing as the \\"Spider Hero\\").Mighty Avengers Vol. 2 #4 Kaluu later appears as a member of the Mighty Avengers.Captain America and the Mighty Avengers #1 Powers and abilities Kaluu has the ability to manipulate magical forces for a vast number of effects, including levitation, teleportation, energy projection, conjuration of small physical objects, physical transformation of objects, and the tapping of extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He has used this skill to render himself immortal. He also has the powers of mesmerism, thought-casting, illusion-casting, and astral projection. According to the back story of the character, Kaluu is possibly the most powerful living human black magician. Kaluu's magic derives not only from personal, universal and dimensional powers: he has powers gained through the tapping of the life forces of living beings and the manipulation of the environment in certain ways that have destructive side effects. Kaluu has used mystical means to render himself immortal. He does not age, but he can be killed by external means. Kaluu is a master of various Asian martial arts, but prefers not to engage in physical combat. He has extensively studied sorcery and possesses vast knowledge of black magical lore. Kaluu formerly wore an eye-patch covering his left eye, though this eye has since been restored.

The historical portion of the cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The main areas of the cemetery are laid out in with winding curvilinear paths, typical of the rural cemetery movement popular in the 19th century, while later sections of the cemetery are typically (but not entirely) laid out in a more rectilinear fashion. A number of architecturally significant mausoleums are located in the cemetery, the most prominent of which are the Chisholm Tomb and the F.O.J. Smith Tomb; the former is a small-scale Classical Revival replica of the Maison Carr√©e, a Roman temple in N√Æmes, France. The cemetery was established in 1855 in Saccarappa (Westbrook) and became the area's main cemetery after the Western Cemetery.

It is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder. It is generally not discovered until 2‚Äì3 years of age, since growth is normal at first. Pseudoachondroplasia is usually first detected by a drop of linear growth in contrast to peers, a waddling gait or arising lower limb deformities. Pseudoachondroplasia (also known as PSACH, pseudoachondroplastic dysplasia, and pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia syndrome) is an osteochondrodysplasia that results in mild to severely short stature due to the inhibition of skeletal growth primarily in the limbs. Though similarities in nomenclature may cause confusion, pseudoachondroplasia should not be confused with achondroplasia, which is a clinically and genetically distinct skeletal dysplasia. Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Mutation in the COMP gene can also cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Despite the radioclinical similarities between pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, the latter is less severe.132400 Signs and symptoms Disproportionate short stature, deformity of the lower limbs, short fingers, and ligamentous laxity give pseudoachondroplasia its distinctive features. The average height of adult males with the condition is around 120 centimeters (3 ft, 11 in), while adult females are typically around 116 cm (3 ft, 9in). Affected individuals are not noticeably short at birth. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia present with gait abnormalities, lower limb deformity, or a retarded growth rate that characteristically appear at age 2‚Äì3 years. Disproportionate short stature is characterized by shortening of proximal limb segments (humeri and femora) also called rhizomelic shortening. Other known clinical features include, genu valgum/varum, brachydactyly (short fingers), supple flexion deformity of the hips, knees, hyperlordosis of lumbar spine, rocker bottom feet and broadening of the metaphyseal ends of long bones especially around the wrists, knees and ankles. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia have normal intelligence and craniofacial features. image:Pseudoachondroplasia 01.jpgPseudoachondroplasia image:Pseudoachondroplasia 02.jpgPseudoachondroplasia image:Pseudoachondroplasia 03.jpgPseudoachondroplasia Genetics Pseudoachondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, though one case of a very rare autosomal recessive form has been documented. The offspring of affected individuals are at 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele. Prenatal testing by molecular genetic examination is available if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member (Hecht et al. 1995). Pathophysiology COMP is an extracellular calcium binding protein directly involved in chondrocyte migration and proliferation. It is observed at a high frequency in chondrocytes in developing bone and tendon. In pseudochondroplasia, COMP is not secreted, but instead collects in the chondrocytes, ultimately poisoning and killing them. Though some chondrocytes do manage to survive, growth is significantly reduced, resulting in the characteristically short limbs and seemingly unaffected face and torso of those inflicted with the disorder (OMIM 2008). Mutations in COMP result in a phenotypic spectrum that varies from pseudochondroplasia (at the most extreme end) to multiple epiphyseal dysplasia or MED (a genetically similar, though milder skeletal dysplasia). Studies conducted by Hetch et al. suggest that type IX collagen, a collagen active specifically in the construction of cartilage, plays a key role in pseudoachondroplasia. The researchers found that IX collagen was amassed within the pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes. This discovery suggests that the pathogenesis of pseudoachondroplasia involves the interactions of the mutant COMP gene products with specific cartilage components, such as type IX collagen, and that it is not solely the result of the effects of mutant molecules on the production and secretion of COMP (OMIM 2008). =Molecular biology= The COMP gene is located on chromosome 19p13.1; its precise locus is P49747. COMP contains 19 exons. The cartilage oligomeric matrix protein is 757 aa (OMIM 2008). COMP protein is found in the extracellular matrix, a complex web of proteins and other molecules that form in the spaces between the cells that make up ligaments and tendons. It is also found near chondrocytes (cartilage-forming cells). Chondrocytes play a vital role in osteogenesis (the formation of bone), particularly in the spine, hips, and limbs where osteogenesis begins with the formation of cartilage, which is then calcified and transformed into bone. We do not yet fully understand the normal function of COMP protein, though it is believed to play a part in cellular growth, division and apoptosis (self-destruction) of cells, as well as participating in the regulation of cell movement and attachment (OMIM 2008). Nearly 60 mutations in the COMP gene have been identified in individuals with pseudoachondroplasia. However, the mutation responsible for the most common allele is a deletion of one codon within a very short triplet repeat (GAC), in which the 469th amino acid, an aspartic acid, is deleted (OMIM 2008). Diagnosis Pseudoachondroplasia. Leg radiographs depicting dysplastic distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses, and distal femoral metaphyseal broadening, cupping, irregularities (white arrows) and radiolucent areas especially medially. Note the metaphyseal line of ossification of the proximal tibias (blackarrows) and relative sparing of the tibial shafts. The changes around the knee are known as \\"rachitic-like changes\\". Lesions are bilateral and symmetrical. Exact diagnosis remains widely built on precise history taking, with the characteristic clinical and radiographic skeletal features. Genetic diagnosis is based on DNA sequencing. Because plasma COMP levels are significantly reduced in patients with COMP mutations, such as pseudoachondroplasia, measuring plasma COMP levels has become a reliable means of diagnosing this and pathopysiologically similar disorders. =Skeletal radiography= Accurate assessment of plain radiographic findings remains an important contributor to diagnosis of pseudoachondroplasia. It is noteworthy that vertebral radiographic abnormalities tend to resolve over time. Epiphyseal abnormalities tend to run a progressive course. Patients usually suffer early-onset arthritis of hips and knees. Many unique skeletal radiographic abnormalities of patients with pseudoachondroplasia have been reported in the literature. *Together with rhizomelic limb shortening, the presence of epiphyseal-metaphyseal changes of the long bones is a distinctive radiologic feature of pseudoachondroplasia. *Hypoplastic capital femoral epiphyses, broad short femoral necks, coxa vara, horizontality of acetabular roof and delayed eruption of secondary ossification center of os pubis and greater trochanter. *Dysplastic/hypoplastic epiphyses especially of shoulders and around the knees. *Metaphyseal broadening, irregularity and metaphyseal line of ossification. These abnormalities that are typically encountered in proximal humerus and around the knees are collectively known as ‚Äúrachitic-like changes‚Äù. *Radiographic lesions of the appendicular skeleton are typically bilateral and symmetric. *Oval shaped vertebrae with anterior beak originating and platyspondyly demonstrated on lateral radiographs of the spine. *Normal widening of the interpedicular distances caudally demonstrated on anteroposterior radiographs of the dorsolumbar region. This is an important differentiating feature between pseudoachondroplasia and achondroplasia. *Odontoid hypoplasia may occur resulting in cervical instability. =Differential diagnosis= *Achondroplasia *Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia *Mucopolysaccharidosis *Other causes of genu valgum (knock knees) or genu varum (bow legs) such as rickets *Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita *Radiographic findings of the pelvis and hips found in Perthes disease should not be confused with pseudochondroplasia. Patients with Perthes disease may present with unilateral hip affection. Besides bilateral hip affection are usually asymmetric. In contrast patients with pseudochondroplasia typically exhibit bilateral and symmetric hip involvement. Treatment There is currently no cure for pseudoachondroplasia. However, management of the various health problems that result from the disorder includes medications such as analgesics (painkillers) for joint discomfort, osteotomy for lower limb deformities, and the surgical treatment of scoliosis. Prevention of some related health problems includes physical therapy to preserve joint flexibility and regular examinations to detect degenerative joint disease and neurological manifestations (particularly spinal cord compression). Additionally, healthcare providers recommend treatment for psychosocial issues related to short stature and other physical deformities for both affected individuals and their families (OMIM 2008). Epidemiology Pseudoachondroplasia is one of the most common skeletal dysplasias affecting all racial groups. However, no precise incidence figures are currently available (Suri et al. 2004). History In 1995 the gene responsible for Pseudoachondroplasia was identified by a research team led by Dr. Jacqueline Hecht of The University of Texas-Houston, Health Science Center. This discovery additionally shed light on the COMP protein, which the team recognized as somehow involved in skeletal growth and height determination (Hetch et al. 1995). In 1997, Hetch and her colleagues from the Research Department at Shriners Hospital for Children in Portland, Oregon conducted further research, which led to their discovery that the intracellular fate of mutant COMP is determined by the environment of individual chondrocytes, contrary to the previous notion that COMP activities leading to Pseudoachondroplasia were determined by structural effects of the mutation on COMP; this meant that COMP activities are cell-specific (Hetch et al. 1995). Hetch et al. also discovered type IX collagen accumulated within the Pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes. This discovery indicated the pathogenesis of Pseudoachondroplasia results from the interactions of the products of the mutant COMP allele with certain ‚Äúcartilage components,‚Äù particularly with type IX collagen (Hetch et al. 1995).

Education Cassidy was born in Illinois. He received a Bachelor of Music degree, with distinction, from Northwestern University's School of Music in Evanston, Illinois, where his main instructors in composition were Jay Alan Yim, Alan Stout, and Michael Pisaro. He went on to study composition with David Felder and Jeffery Stadelman at the University at Buffalo (SUNY) where he received a Ph.D. in 2003. He also participated in masterclass and lessons with composers including Richard Barrett, Chaya Czernowin, Brian Ferneyhough, Jonathan Harvey, Alvin Lucier, and Tristan Murail, among others. Style Cassidy's music exhibits a radical approach to parametric organisation in composition, especially in his solo works, in a manner that he describes as to do with \\"decoupling\\". In works such as the ten monophonic miniatures for pianist, he treats the sound of the pianist's fingers on the keys as a separate parameter in the music, and in this and other pieces he incorporates and integrates a wide range of extended instrumental techniques. He is concerned to explore the possibilities of fracturing between different musical parameters, and to defamiliarise aspects of traditional performance practice. Intellectual influences upon his music include the work of Roman Jakobson and that of Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari. His work is sometimes associated with the New Complexity. Cassidy's work has been performed by a wide range of leading contemporary music specialists, including ELISION Ensemble, Ensemble SurPlus, the Ictus Ensemble, the Kairos Quartet, Quatuor Diotima, ensemble recherche, Mieko Kanno, Garth Knox, Ian Pace, Christopher Redgate, Carl Rosman, and Peter Veale, at many venues and festivals including the Gaudeamus International Music Week (where he was a Jurors Prize nominee, in 2002 and 2004), the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, the Bludenzer tage zeitgem√§√üer musik, the Bienal Internacional de Musica y Tecnolog√≠a (Mexico City), the Samtida Musik Stockholm, the festival June In Buffalo, and the ISCM World Music Days (Zagreb 2005), as well as being broadcast by radio stations in Britain, France, Germany and Austria. Writings Cassidy has also written articles for New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century and is currently preparing an article on the compositional pedagogy of Michael Finnissy. He also works as a conductor and organist, and acts as conductor and pianist for Augenmusik, a Buffalo-based ensemble specializing in the performance of graphic scores and works in open form, frequently for unusual instrumentations. He has also worked recently as a CD producer, particularly for EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble in their discs of the music of Michael Finnissy, Christopher Fox, and Howard Skempton, which were released on the NMC label. In 2005, Cassidy was appointed to the composition faculty of the Bienen School of Music at Northwestern University, where he taught and was also responsible for organizing the New Music Northwestern concert series. He was formerly a visiting assistant professor of music at Buffalo State College. He joined the faculty of the University of Huddersfield in 2007 as senior lecturer in composition.

He succeeded Bernd Pischetsrieder as CEO of Volkswagen AG in 2007. Prior to that, he had been the chairman of the board of management of the Volkswagen Group subsidiary Audi AG. Winterkorn resigned from Volkswagen on 23 September 2015, several days after an emissions cheating scandal was revealed that concerned the company's diesel cars. He resigned as chairman of Audi on 11 November 2015, after further information associated with the scandal was revealed in regard to VW's gasoline-powered engines. Winterkorn was on the board of supervisors for German football club Bayern M√ºnchen from 22 February 2003 until 18 December 2018. Winterkorn was credited for the successful partnership between Audi and Bayern. Winterkorn was criminally indicted over the emissions cheating scandal in the United States on 3 May 2018 on charges of fraud and conspiracy. In April 2019 he was criminally indicted on charges of fraud in Germany. Biography =Education= Winterkorn studied metallurgy and metal physics at the University of Stuttgart from 1966 to 1973. From 1973 to 1977 he was a PhD student at the Max-Planck-Institute for Metal Research and Metal Physics, where he received his doctorate in 1977. He played football as a goalkeeper.Muller, Joann (6 May 2013). \\"How Volkswagen Will Rule The World\\" Forbes Magazine. Page 2 Page 3 Archive of page 1 =Career= Winterkorn embarked on his career in 1977, as a specialist assistant in the research division \\"Process Engineering\\" at Robert Bosch GmbH. From 1978 to 1981, he headed the refrigerant compressor development group \\"Substances and Processes\\" at Robert Bosch and Bosch-Siemens-Hausger√§te GmbH. In 1993 Winterkorn became head of Group Quality Assurance at Volkswagen AG, and was appointed General Manager of Volkswagen AG with power of attorney in March 1994. He was additionally responsible for the VW Group Product Management from June 1995. In January 1996, Winterkorn took over from Herbert Schuster as Member of the Brand Board of Management for \\"Technical Development\\" for the Volkswagen brand. From July 2000, he was Member of the VW Group Board of Management for Technical Development. Winterkorn was instrumental in getting Volkswagen CEO Ferdinand Pi√´ch to approve the production of the New Beetle. Winterkorn had been chairman of the board of management of Audi AG since 1 March 2002. He headed the Audi brand group, including the brands SEAT and Lamborghini, which was formed on 1 January 2002. Winterkorn also assumed responsibility for Technical Development at Audi AG with effect from 1 January 2003. In his capacity as CEO of the Board of Management of Audi AG, Winterkorn was also Member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG. He succeeded Bernd Pischetsrieder as CEO of Volkswagen AG on 1 January 2007, and by 2014 he was the highest paid CEO of all companies listed on Germany's blue-chip DAX stock market. Since June 2003, Winterkorn has served as an honorary professor of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, in recognition of his service to the promotion of research at the establishment. He was featured both in the 2007 and the 2008 Power List of American automotive magazine Motor Trend. After he succeeded Pischetsrieder in 2007, Winterkorn embarked on the \\"Strategie 2018\\" with the goal to bypass General Motors and Toyota by the year 2018, to become the world's largest automaker. Among Winterkorn's initiatives are the platforms MQB and MLB which standardize the area between accelerator pedal and front wheels (including engines) where 60% of the development costs occur, to reduce cost while increasing design flexibility for the rest of the car. In the VW Group, he was viewed as having attention to detail,Muller 2013. Quote: \\"earning a reputation as a boss who obsesses about the tiniest product details\\" being \\"product-focused\\" and \\"methodical and precise\\", but also demanding.Muller 2013. Quote: \\"He doesn‚Äôt like bad news. Before anyone reports to him, they make sure they have good news.\\" =Diesel emissions scandal= In September 2015, Winterkorn apologized for Volkswagen AG having installed software in its diesel cars to allow the vehicles to pass emissions tests by decreasing emissions when the vehicle detected it was undergoing testing but otherwise pollute at amounts well beyond legally allowed limits. Winterkorn confirmed that Volkswagen AG could face fines of up to $18bn, but had not issued a recall at the time of Winterkorn's departure. Winterkorn blamed \\"the terrible mistakes of a few people,\\" whom he did not name, for the international scandal. Winterkorn resigned as CEO on 23 September 2015, as he accepted responsibility for the scandal while asserting that he was \\"not aware of any wrongdoing on my part.\\" Winterkorn additionally resigned as Audi chairman on 11 November 2015. The resignation came a week after additional revelations were made public regarding further vehicle emission test rigging, this time in gasoline-powered vehicles, in amounts approaching one million. Trial In September 2020, the Braunschweig state court ruled that Winterkorn would face trial over his role in the emissions scandal. He faces charges of fraud and market manipulation regarding the installation of the illegal ‚Äúdefeat device‚Äù in Volkswagen cars but knowingly failing to inform the markets in good time. Winterkorn has since denied all charges. Winterkorn indictments =United States= Winterkorn was charged in a United States indictment with fraud and conspiracy in the case on 3 May 2018. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated Winterkorn would be prosecuted vigorously, and added ‚ÄúIf you try to deceive the United States, then you will pay a heavy price.‚Äù The criminal charges increased the likelihood that Winterkorn would face similar actions in his native Germany, and impact an existing shareholders lawsuit against Volkswagen. Additionally, the indictment raised questions regarding Volkswagen‚Äôs internal review of the incident, which at the time of the Winterkorn indictment had not been made public. Winterkorn had repeatedly denied knowledge of the widespread Volkswagen emissions test cheating up to the indictment, including his statements before the German parliament, the Bundestag. The chairman of the committee looking into the scandal, Herbert Behrens, was reported to be incredulous at Winterkorn‚Äôs statement that he had not heard the term defeat device (the technology at the heart of the scandal) prior to the first news reports about the emissions lawbreaking in 2015. The indictment specifically references a 2015 business conference in Wolfsburg, Germany where Winterkorn is alleged to have been briefed on, and approved the ‚Äúcontinued concealment‚Äù of, the defeat device software from U.S. regulators, and notes emails from that year from VW‚Äôs then- compliance liaison Oliver Schmidt, who pled guilty in the case in 2017, receiving a seven year jail term. =Germany= On 15 April 2019 he was also charged in Germany by regional prosecutors of the city of Braunschweig of fraud, of violating laws prohibiting unfair competition as well as defalcation (Untreue). In January 2020 it was reported that the German judge in the case stated that Winterkorn might be allowed to keep 12 million dollars in bonuses, and possibly walk free from the charges.https://www.businessinsider.com/former-vw-ceo-may-keep-12-million- bonus-dieselgate-charges-2020-1 References External links * Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from Leonberg Category:German Roman Catholics Category:German chief executives Category:Chief executives in the automobile industry Category:Volkswagen Group executives Category:Audi people Category:Scania AB people Category:Porsche people Category:FC Bayern Munich board members Category:Fugitives wanted by the United States Category:Fugitives wanted on fraud charges ","title":"Martin Winterkorn"},{"id":"7960298","text":"Ribeira do Ilh√©u is a settlement in the northern part of the island of Fogo, Cape Verde.

The BPP's mission states that it is \\"dedicated to the furthering of new original plays and theatre.\\" The BPP only produces original work. It also holds playwriting contests and offers programs and classes in playwriting and acting. History Tom Moseman and Jim Leonard founded the BPP in 1979, seeking to create a venue for local playwrights that would serve as an alternative to Indiana University. The first productions, including Leonard's And They Dance Real Slow in Jackson and Greg Owens' Queen of Bakersfield, were done on a tight budget and fast-paced schedule. Eventually, the BPP established itself as the only theater in Indiana‚Äîand one of the few theaters in the entire country‚Äîdedicated to producing only new plays. In 1993, BPP benefactor Reva Shiner helped establish an annual new play competition, the Reva Shiner Full Length Play Contest, which brought submissions of scripts from all around the country, including work from both established and up-and-coming playwrights. In its first year of existence the contest, which awards the winner both a cash prize and a full production, was won by Glenn Alterman and his play Nobody‚Äôs Flood. Subsequent winners include Between Men and Cattle by Richard Kalinoski; Sister Calling My Name by Buzz McLaughlin; Medea With Child by Janet Burroway; Alice in Ireland by Judy Sheehan; The Return of Morality by Jamie Pachino; Outrage by Itamar Moses; and Maleficia by Suzanne Wingrove. Many of these plays have gone on to win additional awards and high-profile productions. In 2010, a new competition for dramatic plays was established. The Woodward/Newman Drama Award is an exclusive honor offered by Bloomington Playwrights Project, sponsored by Newman's Own Foundation, remembering the many great dramas Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman performed in together. The winner is awarded a prize of $3,000 and a full production as part of the BPP‚Äôs Mainstage season. Other playwrights who have had work produced at the BPP include Israel Horovitz, Wendy MacLeod, Craig Wright, Toni Press-Coffman, Michael Healey, Sheila Callaghan, Don Zolidis, Jim Henry, Arlene Hutton, OyamO, Trista Baldwin, Eric Pfeffinger, Susan Lieberman, Marsha Estell, Janet Allard, Henry Murray Henry Murray (playwright) and Suzanne Bradbeer. The BPP began performing in a simple black box space, but now has two theater spaces: the Timothy J. Wiles mainstage and the Lora Shiner Studio. It produces a full subscription season, and at various times in its recent history has also hosted a drama school, a children's play festival, resident improv and sketch comedy troupes, an edgy late-night theater series, and cutting-edge cabaret. In 2006 a substantial grant from the National Endowment for the Arts subsidized a festival of plays by Latino and Latina writers.

He played for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League from 1969 to 1978. High school Wade attended Martinsville High School where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He was selected to the first team all-state football team as both a quarterback and punter. Not only excelling in football, Wade also was on the 1964 State Basketball Championship team and performed well enough on the baseball diamond so that he was offered a professional baseball contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates franchise out of high school. Spurning the baseball contract, Wade decided to attend Virginia Tech on a full football scholarship after graduating in 1965. College Once at Virginia Tech, Wade was one of 9 Freshman quarterbacks and earned his position as the quarterback of the Freshman team. After having philosophical differences with Head Coach Jerry Claiborne Wade decided that he was going to transfer schools and play football somewhere else. Prior to transferring, Wade went back for summer camp and worked his way up to starting quarterback. Upon being named first string quarterback, Wade informed the coaching staff that he would be leaving. After transferring out, Wade found himself at Emory & Henry College in Southwest Virginia where he participated in football, basketball, and baseball. While at Emory and Henry, Wade started at quarterback where he also assumed the role of punter, placekicker, and offensive coordinator by calling his own plays. He led the nation in scoring during the 1967 season with 141 points and with his athletic ability and astute play calling, also led the team to a national record in total offence with an average of 553.3 yards per game during the 1968 season. During that same 1968 season, he was second in the nation in total offense and passing, threw 28 touchdowns, rushed for 9 touchdowns, kicked 31 extra points, had a 9-1 winning record, and was voted 1st team Associated Press Little All-American Quarterback, his second All-America selection after his first coming after the 1967 season. Wade was voted Virginia's College Football Player of the Year in 1966, 67, and 68. As a result of his performance in the 1968 season, Wade was selected to play quarterback at the North-South Shriners Classic football game. Expected to be selected in one of the first several rounds of the 1969 NFL draft, Wade's draft position slipped to the tenth round after throwing three interceptions in the North-South game and was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles with the 236th overall pick. Wade was also selected by the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League and in the days prior to TV deals and large salaries offered to players, he was offered the same contract terms for both teams and decided to head to Montreal after extensive changes were made in the Philadelphia front office. One year after graduating, he was inducted into the E&H; Hall of Fame and his #18 jersey was retired. CFL Wade joined the Montreal Alouettes in 1969 after they had suffered 9 straight losing seasons. Coached by former Alouettes great Sam Etcheverry and starting in the 1973 season the famed Marv Levy, Wade became one of the best clutch players in Grey Cup history. Wade started his first game in Montreal on the defensive side of the ball. He played his first Canadian Football League plays as the \\"Monster Man\\" which is the 12th man in Canadian football that is a hybrid between a defensive back and linebacker. After diving for an interception and dropping it upon hitting the ground, Wade started the next offensive series as quarterback and it is from that position and as punter where he achieved his lasting fame. His first season in 1969 was statistically not great with 164 completions out of 348 attempts for a completion percentage of 47.1%. He also was intercepted a total of 30 times that year with only 12 passing TDs. Montreal finished the season with a record of 2-10-2 and finished fourth in the eastern conference. The following season things turned around for both Wade and the Alouettes. Although Wade posted similar statistics as the prior year, including a career high of 31 interceptions thrown for the season, the Alouettes finished the season with a 7-6-1 record heading into the playoffs. Known for his cool headed play in the post season, Wade led the team to a 4-0 record in the playoffs including the 1970 Grey Cup victory where they Alouettes defeated the Calgary Stampeders 23-10. For his performance in this game, Wade was awarded the first of his three Grey Cup MVP awards. Injured in the 1973 season and only playing one game, he returned to the 1974 season to split time with Jimmy Jones at quarterback. The Als fared well during this season with the dual QB lineup and made it to the Grey Cup where they faced the favoured Edminton Eskimos. After a largely ineffective performance by Jimmy Jones, Wade came in during the second quarter with the Als down 7-0 and led the team to a 20-7 victory and was awarded his second Grey Cup MVP award. The following year the Als again met the Eskimos in the Grey Cup and Wade again reprised his role as relief for an ineffective Jimmy Jones and led the team on a late fourth-quarter drive deep into Edmonton territory before falling 9-8 on a missed field goal attempt. Wade and the Alouettes once again played the Eskimos in the Grey Cup after the 1977 season where during the 65th Grey Cup of 1977, while quarterbacking on ice, he completed 22 of 40 passes for 340 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception in a crushing 41-6 win over the Edmonton Eskimos. After this game he received his third Grey Cup MVP award. Wade was known to perform exceptionally well under difficult weather conditions, playing better in the playoffs than the regular season. After the 1978 season and a career of injuries Wade decided to head to Philadelphia to play as the backup quarterback and the punter but suffered a career ending injury after a few minutes of the first day of training camp. After that final injury, Wade decided to head back to his hometown of Martinsville to settle down. During his 10 years with Montreal, he completed 1083 of his 2087 passes, for 51.9%, and 15,014 yards. He threw for 89 touchdowns, but his greatest weakness was the interception, and he was picked off 169 times. This includes 30 picks in his rookie season of 1969 and 31 in the Grey Cup championship year of 1970. He also had a record 7 interceptions thrown against the Calgary Stampeders on September 24, 1972. In addition, he still hold the Als record for most punts, with 852. He was the first three-time winner of the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player award, equaled by Doug Flutie and Damon Allen.  Post Football Career  After football, Wade entered into the textile industry in his hometown of Martinsville Virginia which during the 1980s and early 1990s was known as the \\"sweatshirt capital of the world\\". After a 20-year career in sweatshirt sales, Wade retired in 1999 and lives out his golden years hunting, gardening, trapping, and fishing. Wade now spends his Wednesday and Saturday mornings as a perennial staple and crowd favorite at the local farmers market where he sells the vegetables he has grown in his personal garden.

He was consul in 2 BC as the colleague of the emperor Augustus.Attilio Degrassi, I fasti consolari dell'Impero Romano dal 30 avanti Cristo al 613 dopo Cristo (Rome, 1952), p. 5 Biography Marcus Plautius Silvanus was a member of the gens Plautia, the son of another Marcus Plautius Silvanus and Urgulania.Lily Ross Taylor, \\"Trebula Suffenas and the Plautii Silvani\\", Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, 24 (1956), p. 24 She was probably of Etruscan descent, and the close friend of the empress Livia. It is suggested by Ronald Syme Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 88; The Roman Revolution (Oxford: University Press, 1939), pp. 385, 399 extrapolating from Tacitus Tacitus, The Annals of Imperial Rome, Penguin, 1956, p. 93 that it was Urgulania's influence over Livia that allowed Silvanus to climb the cursus honorum, enabling him to reach the consulate in 2 BC alongside Augustus. Silvanus was then made proconsul of Asia in 4-5 AD,Syme, Roman Revolution, p. 435; Augustan Aristocracy, p. 340 followed by a posting as imperial legate in Galatia in 6 AD, where he was involved in suppressing the Isaurians Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 333; also \\"Galatia and Pamphylia under Augustus: The Governorship of Piso, Quirinus and Silvanus\\", Klio, 27 (1934), pp. 122-148. as mentioned in Cassius Dio.Cassius Dio, The Roman History, LV, 28 He was also a septimvir of the Epulones. Attested in the inscription on his Mausoleum in Tivoli (ILS 986), and Although serving under Tiberius for the duration of the Great Illyrian Revolt or Bellum Batonianum, Syme extrapolates from Tacitus that the future emperor had doubts concerning Silvanus, due to his close connection, via his mother Urgulania, with Livia.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, 1986, p. 88 Tacitus, Annales, II, 34. Certainly Silvanus does not appear in the histories after the events in Illyricum during AD 6-9.  Suppression of the Isaurians  In the year AD 6, Silvanus was assigned as Proconsul to the province of Galatia, which by that date included the coastal region of Pamphylia. Cassius Dio writes that the Isaurians began a series of 'marauding expeditions', and did not desist until they were faced with 'grim war.' The modern historian, Noel Lenski, following Syme and Mitchell, writes that the client king, Archelaus I, was unable to handle the uprising himself, 'and thereby forced the Romans to commit at least two legions under Marcus Plautius Silvanus to regain control.'Lenski, N. (1999) \\"From Assimilation and Revolt in the Territory of Isauria, from the Sixth Century BC to the Sixth Century AD\\" Syme, \\"Galatia and Pamphylia under Augustus: The Governorship of Piso, Quirinus and Silvanus\\", Klio 27 (1934), pp. 122-148. Mitchell also suggests that one of these legions was Legio VII Macedonica which was stationed at Antioch during the period.S. Mitchell, \\"Legio VII and the Garrison of Augustan Galatia\\", Classical Quarterly, 26 (1976), pp. 298-308.  Participation in The Great Illyrian Revolt, or Bellum Batonianum  Late in AD 6, the Great Illyrian Revolt or Bellum Batonianum began in Illyricum.Cassius Dio, Roman History, Bk 55, ch 29 In AD 7, probably late in autumn of early in winter, Silvanus was summoned by Tiberius, who had been assigned to the command of the military situation in Illyricum, to bring more forces to help suppress the revolt.Velleius Paterculus, The Roman History, II, 111.2 The ancient writers do not state where these legions came from; however modern historians have deduced that he brought two (or possibly three) legions, possibly Legio IV Scythica and Legio V Macedonica, perhaps drawn from Syria Syme, \\"Some Notes on the Legions Under Augustus\\", Journal of Roman Studies (1933), p. 29.Daniel Dzino, The Failure of Greater Illyricum (2010), pp. 152-3J.J. Wilkes, Dalmatia (1969), pp. 92-93 Regarding the year in which Silvanus arrived in Illyricum, the ancient writers all give the year AD 7, which was followed by the twentieth century historian Syme who stated the 7 AD date was 'indisputable.'Syme, \\"Some Notes on the Legions Under Augustus\\", p. 28.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 289 However, some modern historians have suggested a contradictory, and probably erroneous, 'amphibious landing' during AD 6 For example, Jason R. Abdale, The Great Illyrian Revolt (2019), p. 144. Velleius Paterculus seems to suggest that Silvanus joined Caecina Severus, the imperial legate of Moesia, in his province before they marched together towards Illyricum. During the march, they were joined by a cavalry force of Thracians, led by King Rhoemetalces. This force was unexpectedly attacked en route by the enemy near the Volcaean marshes, in northern Pannonia near Siscia (modern Sisak), but successfully defeated them.Velleius Paterculus, The Roman History, II, 112.4 Dio, however, does not mention Silvanus' involvement in this incident, Cassius Dio, Roman History, LV, 31 while modern historians explicitly state that this event only involved Caecina and his Moesian forces.Daniel Dzino, The Failure of Greater Illyricum, p. 151Syme, \\"Some Notes on the Legions Under Augustus\\" Once the two generals, Silvanus and Caecina Severus, and their legions had joined forces and successfully reached Illyricum, they fought a major battle against the rebels near Sirmium. The Roman forces were victorious, but suffered heavy losses. Velleius Paterculus mentions the deaths of military tribunes, a number of prefects, a camp prefect and some centurions, including some of the front rank. No number is given of total deaths.Velleius Paterculus, The Roman History, Bk 2, ch 112.5 Paterculus called this battle 'an almost deadly defeat' and states that the victory 'won more glory [for the soldiers] than was left over for their officers,' due to their failure to follow Tiberius' example and send out scouts to ascertain the location of the enemy. Following this unpromising beginning, Silvanus with his two 'eastern legions', accompanied by Caecina's legion, marched to Siscia (modern Sisak) to join Tiberius and the two legions already assembled there. Dzino, Failure of Greater Illyricum, p. 153 Once the men had had time to recover, Tiberius immediately split the forces into four, sending Caecina back to Moesia, and marching with Silvanus and the 'eastern legions' back to Sirmium where they wintered, and where Silvanus continued to operate from for the remainder of the conflict. Paterculus states that Tiberius took them on a 'long and extremely arduous march, the difficulties of which are hardly describable,'Velleius Paterculus, The Roman History II, 113.3 though he does not mention Silvanus' role specifically. During AD 8, Dio relates that Silvanus personally led a successful campaign to defeat the Breucians, and won the allegiance of some other Illyrian tribes without a fight.Cassius Dio, Roman History LV, 34 In the final year of the revolt, AD 9, Silvanus remained in Illyricum, acting out of Sirmium. Dio states that his forces were ravaging Pannonia, which caused the remaining tribes to make terms. For his actions, he was granted triumphal honours along with the other commanders,Cassius Dio, Roman History, LVI, 17 attested by the inscription which appears on Silvanus' tomb in Tivoli, Italy.  Family  Marcus Plautius Silvanus was the son of another Marcus Plautius Silvanus (unattested) and Urgulania, a close friend of Livia. It is possible that the family is descended from Marcus Plautius Hypsaeus, consul in 125 BC, however this is doubted by Syme.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 87 Silvanus married Lartia. Their known children include: * Marcus Plautius Silvanus. First married Fabia Numantina, but their marriage was over prior to AD 24, as by then he was married to Apronia, daughter of Lucius Apronius. He was accused of murdering Apronia by throwing her out of a window.Tacitus, Annales IV.22.3 Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 418 The murder was investigated by emperor Tiberius himself. Urgulania then sent her grandson a dagger, encouraging him to commit suicide, which he duly did. Shortly after the murder of Apronia, Fabia Numantina was \\"charged with having caused her husband's insanity by magical incantations and potions\\", but was acquitted. * Aulus Plautius Urgulanius. Died at the age of nine. * Publius Plautius Pulcher. Friend and companion of his nephew Claudius Drusus. Quaestor to Tiberius, and augur; governor of Sicilia. * Plautia Urgulanilla, first wife of the emperor Claudius. He is also the first cousin of Aulus Plautius, who was the father of Aulus Plautius, leader of the Invasion of Britannia in 43 AD.  Mausoleum of the Plautii  thumb The mausoleum in which Marcus Plautius Silvanus was interred still stands in modern Tivoli, Italy. A large inscription outlining Silvanus' achievements is still in place, and includes his wife, Lartia and one of his sons, Aulus Plautius Urgulanius, alongside the separate, very detailed stone of his adopted grandson Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus. The Latin inscription reads: \\"M Plautius M F A N/ Silvanus/ Cos VIIvir Epulon/ huic senatus triumphalia/ ornamenta decrevit/ ob res in Ilyrico/ bene gestas/ Lartia CN F Uxor/ A Plautius M F/ Urgulanius/ vixit ann IX.\\" The mausoleum was famously painted as 'The Lucano Bridge and Mausoleum Plauti', and engraved from two different places by Giovanni Battista Piranesihttp://collection.imamuseum.org/artwork/9742/, and amongst others, by Franz Knebel and Onorato Carlandi. It also featured on Spode ceramics, the design called 'Bridge of Lucano' during the early 19th century.

He is best known for his co-writing with Valerie Avon, particularly the song \\"Long Live Love\\" (1974) performed by Olivia Newton-John, which was the UK's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974. He won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Novel or Unusual Song for co-writing \\"Nice One Cyril\\". Early days His interest in music began at an early age, in London's East End, where his uncle regularly took him to the Music hall. It was here that he first met Tony Hiller, (who helped create Brotherhood of Man) and so began a lifelong friendship. Years later Hiller gave Spiro his first publishing deal, and later still was to be involved in producing him in his singing career as 'Hoagy Pogey'. In 1944, aged 18, Spiro volunteered for the Royal Navy and did his training in Chatham, Kent, where he qualified as a nurse, and was sent to Iceland to work on an American naval base. After the World War II ended, he knew that he wanted a career in the music industry, rather than taking over the family shop. He enrolled at Carnegie Hall, where he studied musical theory and conducting. However, popular music became his main interest. Continuing to work in the shop, he wrote songs in his spare time, inspired by the works of George Gershwin and Hoagy Carmichael. In 1954 his father died, and he met his future wife, Barbara, and they married the following year. In 1956, their first child, Judith, was born. Their daughter Lorraine, was born in 1959, and Spiro started a wholesale greeting cards business, where he wrote the verses for the cards he sold. In 1961, their son, Russell, was born.  Musical years  Spiro decided to enter the music business full-time after a discussion with Eddie Cantor. He got his first publishing deal, and also supported his wife's cousin, Phil Wainman, who was later to become the producer for The Bay City Rollers and The Boomtown Rats. Together, they wrote for Mike and Bernie Winters and they also initially worked together with a band, later to become The Sweet, who first rehearsed in the Spiro's living room. Spiro was the co- writer (with Wainman) behind The Yardbirds' hit, \\"Little Games\\" (1967), successful on both sides of the Atlantic. It was one of the first songs of that era to use a sitar in the recording mix. In the 1970s, Spiro met Valerie Avon, his most significant songwriting partner, when he was working at Belwin Mills Publishing. During that time, they wrote many songs together, including tracks recorded by Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway, as The Pipkins, Georgie Fame, Tina Charles, Peter Noone, \\"Desdemona\\" by The Searchers (US #94), \\"Easy Loving\\", a hit for The Troggs and the track, \\"Don't Move Away\\", for both Cliff Richard and Olivia Newton-John. They were involved in the Eurovision Song Contest for two consecutive years with, \\"Can I Believe\\", for Mary Hopkin and \\"In My World of Beautiful Things\\", for Clodagh Rodgers. This culminated in representing the UK with \\"Long Live Love\\", performed by Olivia Newton-John in 1974, which went on to be recorded worldwide by more than fifty artists. Valerie Avon was also instrumental in helping to create a performing image for Spiro. From 1973, as 'Hoagy Pogey', he worked with Jamie Philips and Dougie Squires and the Second Generation, touring Europe, making stage and television appearances. He also had an interview on the Russell Harty show. Football Spiro loved football and was a season ticket holder at Tottenham Hotspur F.C.. This led him to compose \\"Nice One Cyril\\", winning him an Ivor Novello Award. The song, performed by Cockerel Chorus, was inspired by Cyril Knowles who was widely regarded as the greatest left-back in the club's history. The song peaked at number 14 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1973. Spiro, with Jamie Philips singing the operatic introduction, fronted the group, which then went on to record an [album. Throughout his life, Spiro wrote many other football songs, recorded by major teams, including \\"Here We Go\\" for Everton; and \\"Nice One Gazza\\", as well as \\"Tribute to Ardiles and Villa\\" again for Spurs. Spiro also formed a partnership with Alan A. Freeman, well known as a record producer and for establishing Pye Records. Together, they created Spiral Records and later on, a music publishing company, Trekfarm. Jointly they discovered Red Box, who went on to have success with \\"Lean on Me (Ah-li-ayo)\\", a song which reached number three in the UK Singles Chart. Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen The partnership also recorded Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen, with Spiro writing the theme music for Ball's television show, Saturday Night at the Mill. Spiro and Freeman also recorded Barbara Woodhouse, famous for her dog-training skills, \\"Diddy\\" David Hamilton and Les Dawson. Latter years After his success in the 1970s and early 1980s, Spiro became a financial consultant with the insurance company, Sun Alliance. He later moved home to Westgate-on-Sea, and bought a holiday home in Cyprus. He worked with Cypriot writers and musicians, and appeared on Cyprus television. One of the last songs he ever wrote was dedicated to peace and unity there, entitled, \\"Only One Sky\\". When back in England, Spiro continued with his projects, involving local musicians and writers, including the novelist, Peter Corey. He later worked on a musical for children. More recently, thanks to his son Russell, now director of Trekfarm, Spiro's song, \\"We're on the Ball\\", became the official World Cup song for 2002, and with Ant and Dec became a success. Harold Spiro died on 11 December 1996 in Cyprus, where he was buried.

Combinatorial Nullstellensatz  A powerful tool in the study of lower bounds for cardinalities of various restricted sumsets is the following fundamental principle: the combinatorial Nullstellensatz. Let f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) be a polynomial over a field F. Suppose that the coefficient of the monomial x_1^{k_1}\\\\cdots x_n^{k_n} in f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) is nonzero and k_1+\\\\cdots+k_n is the total degree of f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n).

The method using the combinatorial Nullstellensatz is also called the polynomial method. This tool was rooted in a paper of N. Alon and M. Tarsi in 1989, and developed by Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa in 1995-1996, and reformulated by Alon in 1999.

In the , Nudgee had a population of 3,578 people.  Geography  Nudgee is north-west by road of the Brisbane CBD. The suburb is bounded to the north-east by the Gateway Motorway, including Nudgee Golf Club down to Kedron Brook () which forms the south-east boundary, then along Gateway Motorway, including Nudgee Waterhole Reserve () and roughly following Farnshaw Road and Red Hill Road to the south, and then roughly following the Shorncliffe railway line to the north-west.  History  The name Nudgee is derived from the Yuggera word in the Yugarabul dialect nardha or nedgee meaning place of ducks, from nar meaning duck' and dha' meaning place. St Vincent's Convent, early 1900s St Vincent's Orphanage (also known as Nudgee Orphanage) opened on Queens Road (formerly known as Orphanage Road) on 18 December 1866 with children transferred from St Vicent's Orphanage in New Farm. The orphanage was operated by the Sisters of Mercy and had its own school. In 1935 it was renamed St Vincent's Home for Children. The school operated until the 1950s after which the children attended local schools. The home closed in 1971. Having started with 47 children, over 10,500 children lived in the home throughout its operation. The site now accommodates the head office of Mercy Family Services, which provides services to children, adolescents and families. The buildings of the orphanage complex are listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register (). Nudgee Cemetery was established at 493 St Vincents Road in 1867. In 2014 a crematorium was added with columbarium walls for the placement of ashes. New building at Nudgee State School, August 1950 Nudgee State School opened on 28 June 1875 on the western side of Nudgee Road, just south of the junction with Tufnel Road (approximately ) on land donated by Isaac Stuckey (now within the suburb of Banyo). By 1924 frequent flooding of the school building and growth in the local population led to new school buildings being erected at 453 Earnshaw Road. On 31 December 2002 it was closed as part of an amalgamated with Banyo State High School to form Earnshaw State College, which operates from the site of the former high school. \\"A\\" Block of the former state school is listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register () but is now within the suburb of Banyo, just beyond the boundary with Nudgee. St Joseph's College, 2017 St Joseph's College (also known as Nudgee College) opened on January 1891 as a boarding campus of St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. Some of the buildings of the school are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register but the school is now within the suburb of Boondall, just west of Nundah Creek, which is the boundary separating Boondall from present day Nudgee. In 1967 the course was increased to 27 holes. In 1895 a paper was read at Brisbane's Natural History Society meeting at the Queensland Museum about the bora ring identified at Nudgee, described as a circle in diameter and sitting higher than the surrounding land. It was believed there was a second bora ring in the area but it had been lost to farming. Bora rings came in pairs, one for the initiation of young men and the other for communal use. Circa 2000, the surviving bora ring was thought to be the communal bora ring and being oval in shape with dimensions of with an entrance to the west and that the smaller men's initiation bora ring was about away near Redway Street. Plan for the first clubhouse for Nudgee Golf Club, 1930 Nudgee Golf Club was established on 18 January 1930 on land formerly used for grape growing by the Childs family. The first clubhouse opened on 21 January 1931. Initially the course had nine holes, which increased to 16 holes in 1950. On 6 November 1954 the club opened its new clubhouse. In 1985 the Queensland Government wanted to resume part of the golf club's land to construct the Gateway Arterial Road (now the Gateway Motorway). Following two years of negotiations an arrangement was reached in which the government made additional land available to the south to compensate for the resumed land, enabling the course to be extended to 36 holes. Nudgee was part of the Shire of Toombul until 1925 when the shire was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. In 1971 the Banyo Devils Rugby League Club opened beside the Bora Ring on Childs Road in Nudgee (). In the , Nudgee had a population of 3,578 people. Transport Nudgee railway station, 2013 Nudgee is served by the Nudgee railway station () on the Shorncliffe railway line and provides access to regular Queensland Rail City network services to Brisbane and beyond. In the 2011 census, 18.0% of employed people traveled to work on public transport and 60.3% by car (either as driver or as passenger). Telecommunications Nudgee will be amongst the first suburbs in the Brisbane Area to be connected to the National Broadband Network, with services predicted to be available in November 2013. Nudgee's upcoming fibre network will be serviced by the 4NDG fibre serving area. Facilities Nudgee Cemetery entrance.jpg Nudgee cemetery is located on St Vincents Road () and is operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane. It is the largest private cemetery in Brisbane. Although most people buried there are Catholics, non-Catholics can also be buried there. Nudgee Golf Club is at 1207 Nudgee Road (). Despite its name, the Banyo Devils Rugby League Club is at 51 Childs Road in Nudgee ().  Education  There are no schools within the suburb. Earnshaw State College is both the nearest primary and secondary school in neighbouring Banyo.  Attractions  Tours of Indigenous culture including the bora ring and the Nudgee waterhole are available (). Demographics In the 2011 census, Nudgee recorded a population of 2,856 people; 53% female and 47% male. The median age of the Nudgee population was 37 years of age, which was the same as the national median. Children aged under 15 years made up 19.8% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 15.4% of the population. 78% of people living in Nudgee were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 3.6%, England 2.5%, India 2.3%, Philippines 1.8%, Ireland 0.9%. 88.1% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 1.3% Filipino, 1.1% Punjabi, 0.6% Tagalog, 0.6% German, 0.6% Mandarin.

Retrieved 2015-12-22 History =Early history= The Matranga crime family, established by Charles (1857 - October 28, 1943) and Antonio (Tony) Matranga (d. 1890 ?), was one of the earliest recorded American Mafia crime families, operating in New Orleans during the late 19th century until the beginning of Prohibition in 1920. Born in Sicily, Carlo and Antonio Matranga settled in New Orleans during the 1870s where they eventually opened a saloon and brothel. Using their business as a base of operations, the Matranga brothers began establishing lucrative organized criminal activities including extortion and labor racketeering. Receiving tribute payments from Italian laborers and dockworkers, as well as from the rival Provenzano crime family (who held a near monopoly of commercial shipping from South American fruit shipments), they eventually began moving in on Provenzano fruit loading operations intimidating the Provenzanos with threats of violence. Although the Provenzanos withdrew in favor of giving the Matrangas a cut of waterfront racketeering, by the late 1880s, the two families eventually went to war over the grocery and produce businesses held by the Provenzanos. As both sides began employing a large number of Sicilian mafiosi from their native Monreale, Sicily, the violent gang war began attracting police attention, particularly from New Orleans police chief David Hennessy who began investigating the warring organizations. Within months of his investigation, Hennessy was shot by several unidentified attackers while walking home on the night of October 15, 1890; he died of his wounds less than twelve hours later, having failed to identify his assailants beyond allegedly claiming \\"The Dagoes shot me\\". The shooter was never positively identified and the assassination remains unsolved. The murder of Hennessey created a huge backlash from the city and, although Charles and several members of the Matrangas were arrested, they were eventually tried and acquitted in February 1891 with Charles Matranga and a 14-year-old member acquitted midway through the trial as well as four more who were eventually acquitted and three others released in hung juries. The decision caused strong protests from residents, angered by the controversy surrounding the case (particularly in the face of incriminating evidence and jury tampering), and the following month a lynch mob stormed the jail killing 11 of the 19 defendants--five of whom had not been tried--on March 14, 1891. Since then, it has been a hard and fast rule in the American Mafia that law enforcement and prosecutors are not to be harmed. While it was common for gangsters to kill officials who got in their way, the Hennessey murder convinced American gangsters that it was not worth the backlash. Matranga was able to escape from the vigilante lynchings and, upon returning to New Orleans, resumed his position as head of the New Orleans crime family eventually forcing the declining Provenzanos out of New Orleans by the end of the decade. Matranga would rule over the New Orleans underworld until shortly after Prohibition when he turned over leadership over to Sylvestro \\"Sam\\" Carollo in the early 1920s. =Silver Dollar Sam= Slot machines were installed in towns throughout Louisiana, generating a dependable stream of revenue for the \\"family\\". \\"Silver Dollar Sam\\" Carollo led the New Orleans crime family transforming predecessor Charles Matranga's Black Hand gang into a modern organized crime group. Born in Sicily, Carollo immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1904. By 1918, Carollo had become a high- ranking member of Matranga's organization, eventually succeeding him following Matranga's retirement in 1922. Assuming control of Matranga's minor bootlegging operations, Carollo waged war against rival bootlegging gangs, gaining full control following the murder of William Bailey in December 1930. Gaining considerable political influence within New Orleans, Carollo is said to have used his connections when, in 1929, Al Capone supposedly traveled to the city demanding Carollo supply the Chicago Outfit (rather than Chicago's Sicilian Mafia boss Joe Aiello) with imported alcohol. Meeting Capone as he arrived at a New Orleans train station, Carollo, accompanied by several police officers, reportedly disarmed Capone's bodyguards and broke their fingers, forcing Capone to return to Chicago. In 1930, Carollo was arrested for the shooting of federal narcotics agent Cecil Moore, which took place during an undercover drug buy. Despite support by several New Orleans police officers who testified Carollo was in New York at the time of the murder, he was sentenced to two years. Released in 1934, Carollo negotiated a deal with New York mobsters Frank Costello and Phillip \\"Dandy Phil\\" Kastel, as well as Louisiana Senator Huey Long, to bring slot machines into Louisiana, following New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's attacks on organized crime. Carollo, with lieutenant Carlos Marcello, would run illegal gambling operations undisturbed for several years. Carollo's legal problems continued as he was scheduled to be deported in 1940, after serving two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, following his arrest on a narcotics charge in 1938. His deportation was delayed following the U.S. entry into World War II, and Carollo would continue to control the New Orleans crime family for several years before a campaign, begun by reporter Drew Pearson, exposed an attempt by Congressman Jimmy Morrison to pass a bill awarding Carollo with American citizenship (thereby making deportation illegal). Carollo would be deported in April 1947. Soon after returning to Sicily, Carollo organized a partnership with fellow exile Charles Luciano, establishing criminal enterprises in Mexico. Briefly returning to the United States in 1949, he was deported the following year as control of the New Orleans crime family reverted to Carlos Marcello. Living in Palermo, Sicily until 1970, Carollo once again returned to the US. According to Life Magazine, he was asked to return by Marcello, who needed him to mediate disputes within the New Orleans Mafia. After a subsequent attempt to deport him failed, he died a free man in 1970. =Carlos Marcello= FBI's 1963 La Cosa Nostra Commission Chart By the end of 1947, Carlos Marcello had taken control of Louisiana's illegal gambling network. He had also joined forces with New York Mob associate Meyer Lansky in order to skim money from some of the most important casinos in the New Orleans area shortly after becoming associated with the Hotard family through marriage. According to former members of the Chicago Outfit, Marcello was also assigned a cut of the money skimmed from Las Vegas casinos, in exchange for providing \\"muscle\\" in Florida real estate deals. By this time, Marcello had been selected as \\"The Godfather\\" of the New Orleans Mafia, by the family's capos and the National Crime Syndicate after the deportation of Sylvestro \\"Silver Dollar Sam\\" Carollo to Sicily. He held this position for the next thirty years. In a 1975 extortion trial, two witnesses described Marcello as \\"The Godfather\\" of the New Orleans crime syndicate. The New Orleans crime family frequently met at an Italian restaurant in the New Orleans suburb of Avondale, known as Mosca's, a building which Marcello had owned. Marcello appeared before the U.S. Senate's Kefauver Committee on organized crime on January 25, 1951. He pleaded the Fifth Amendment 152 times. The Committee called Marcello \\"one of the worst criminals in the country\\". On April 4, 1961, the U.S. Justice Department, under the direction of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, apprehended Marcello as he made what he assumed was a routine visit to the immigration authorities in New Orleans, then deported him to Guatemala. Two months later, he was back in New Orleans. Thereafter, he successfully fought efforts by the government to deport him. In November 1963, Marcello was tried for \\"conspiracy to defraud the United States government by obtaining a false Guatemalan birth certificate\\" and \\"conspiracy to obstruct the United States government in the exercise of its right to deport Carlos Marcello\\". He was acquitted later that month on both charges. However, in October 1964, Marcello was charged with \\"conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing a juror [Rudolph Heitler] and seeking the murder of a government witness [Carl Noll]\\". Marcello's attorney admitted Heitler had been bribed but said that there was no evidence to connect the bribe with Marcello. Noll refused to testify against Marcello in the case. Marcello was acquitted of both charges. In September 1966, 13 members of the New York, Louisiana and Florida crime families were arrested for \\"consorting with known criminals\\" at the La Stella Restaurant in Queens, New York. However, the charges were later dropped. Returning to New Orleans a few days later, Marcello was arrested for assaulting an FBI agent. His first trial resulted in a hung jury, but he was retried and convicted. He was sentenced to two years but served less than six months. In 1981, Marcello, Aubrey W. Young (a former aide to Governor John J. McKeithen), Charles E. Roemer, II (former commissioner of administration to Governor Edwin Edwards), and two other men were indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans with conspiracy, racketeering, and mail and wire fraud in a scheme to bribe state officials to give the five men multimillion-dollar insurance contracts. The charges were the result of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe known as BriLab. U.S. District Judge Morey Sear allowed the admission of secretly-recorded conversations that he said demonstrated corruption at the highest levels of state government. Marcello and Roemer were convicted, but Young and the two others were acquitted. In its 1978 investigation of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said that it recognized Jack Ruby's murder of Lee Harvey Oswald as a primary reason to suspect organized crime as possibly having involvement in the assassination. In its investigation, the HSCA noted the presence of \\"credible associations relating both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby to figures having a relationship, albeit tenuous, with Marcello's crime family or organization\\". Their report stated: \\"The committee found that Marcello had the motive, means and opportunity to have President John F. Kennedy assassinated, though it was unable to establish direct evidence of Marcello's complicity\\".

Early years Born in Chicago, Illinois, Daddano became a member of the Forty-Two Gang, a local street gang from Maxwell Street on Chicago's West Side. Gang members included such future Outfit heavyweights as Sam Giancana ( also known as \\"Momo\\" or \\"Mooney\\") and Sam \\"Teets\\" Battaglia. Enforcer and mobster By 1936, at age 24, Daddano had accumulated an extensive criminal record in the 42-Gang, including nine counts of bank robbery, larceny and auto theft. Giancana and Battaglia eventually recruited Daddano into the Chicago Outfit. In 1944,Russo, Gus, Outfit, The (2001), pgs. 184ff; Giancana was not part of the Outfit until February 1945, when he became Tony Accardo's driver; but Giancana apparently did not return to the 42-Gang after leaving prison in 1942. He went \\"legit\\" for those few years. Daddano was arrested for attempting to steal three million war ration stamps. While police suspected that the Outfit was behind this crime, Daddano refused to name his accomplices. After World War II, Daddano became a leading enforcer for The Outfit. He also controlled illegal gambling operations in Dupage, Will and Kane countiesSifakis, Carl, Mafia Encyclopedia, The, Second Ed. (1999), pages 106 and in the Chicago suburbs of Cicero and Berwyn. Though a \\"made man\\" and valued \\"capo\\" in the Chicago Outfit, Daddano was not unlike Sam \\"Mad Sam\\" DeStefano, who was not allowed by the Outfit bosses to be \\"made.\\" Daddano has been described as a \\"ruthless and pitiless killer\\" who was refined in torture with ice picks and blowtorches, keeping victims alive for hours while torturing them. In 1963, he had left a Capone-era mobster's wake with DeStefano, in his Cadillac, with Chicago police in hot pursuit of the speeding car.Roemer William F. Jr., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather (1995), pages 87-88 Daddano was the main suspect in at least seven murders. Daddano also had the responsibility to know who every Chicago burglar was, so that the Chicago Outfit could take a \\"street tax ('Tribute')\\" percentage of everything he stole.Roemer, William F.

He was later arrested for conspiracy to rob a Franklin Park Bank, a heist planned by him six years earlier. Daddano was sentenced to 15 years in prison, in the Marion, Illinois, federal penitentiary, a supermax prison at the time. The prison was downgraded in 2006.Marion, IL On September 9, 1975, he died of natural causes in prison, three months after Giancana was executed in the basement of his home by someone who has never been positively identified.

The state park offers wide vistas of the Atlantic Ocean where it meets Narragansett Bay. The park lies adjacent to the Newport Country Club, part of Newport's Ocean Drive Historic District. It is managed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Division of Parks and Recreation, and is overseen by the staff at nearby Fort Adams State Park. History Brenton Point bears the name of Governor William Brenton, an early settler who owned the land as a large farm in the 17th century. Brenton called the area \\"Hammersmith,\\" a name which survives in the name of Hammersmith Farm, an estate on the point later owned by the family of First Lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis. In 1776, during the American Revolution, a battery was set up on the southwest part of Brenton Point as a coastal defense. Between 1876 and 1883, lawyer and businessman Theodore M. Davis built a mansion known as \\"The Reefs\\" (later \\"The Bells\\") on the property, where he lived until his death in 1915. Following the death in 1922 of Emma Andrews, Davis's longtime mistress, the estate became the property of auto magnate Milton J. Budlong. During World War II, the Budlong home was condemned and purchased by the government in order to erect a coastal defense battery as part of the Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay. One of the original four circular concrete \\"Panama mounts,\\" built for towed 155 mm guns, remains in place. Radar and searchlights were also in the area. An anti-motor torpedo boat battery, AMTB 923, was at Brenton Point from July 1943 until moved to Fort Wetherill in July 1944. This battery had four 90 mm guns and two 37 mm guns.Battery AMTB 923 (1) at FortWiki.comBattery AMTB 923 (2) at FortWiki.com At war's end, the battery was dismantled and the estate returned to the Budlongs, who allowed the property to fall into disrepair. The heavily vandalized manor house was partially destroyed by fire in 1960, then torn down in 1963. The state took possession in 1969 as part of Governor John Chafee's Green Acres program; it was then dedicated as a state park in 1974. The park opened to the public in 1976. The former laundry/servants' quarters building serves as the park's visitor center and rangers office. The mansion's now-derelict carriage house and stables still stand, though they have been fenced off and are routinely patrolled by park rangers. A stone observation tower is used by park rangers and tourists to view the forest and ocean. Activities and amenities The park offers picnicking facilities, hiking paths, fishing, and kite flying, and is home to the annual Newport Kite Festival. Though the park is open for parking for fishermen after dusk, state park rangers are known to strictly enforce park regulations even after hours, in response to several large parties that have taken place on the property in years past.

Born in Chicago and moved to Blue Island, Dauber was brought into the Chicago crime syndicate by mobster James \\"Jimmy the Bomber\\" Catuara, who operated illegal gambling and vice in Chicago's Southside. One of only a few southerners within the syndicate, Dauber quickly proved to be a valuable member of \\"The Outfit.\\" As Catuara's prot√©g√©, Dauber was suspected in over 20 unsolved homicides, between 1969 and 1980, in the decade-long struggle for Steven Ostrowski's lucrative South Side chop shop operation. In 1973, Dauber was convicted of mail fraud and the interstate transportation of a stolen car used in an unsolved murder. After his release in 1976, Dauber joined rival mobster Albert Caesar Tocco as a top enforcer who had slowly gained control of the Southside. Shortly after Dauber's defection, Catuara was found shot to death in his red Cadillac on July 28, 1978. During the next several years, relations between Dauber and his former associates would become increasingly strained, as voiced by his wife Charlotte. He reportedly was becoming disgruntled over his treatment as well as his facing several federal indictments for which others may have come to suspect Dauber had agreed to become an informant. It was also well known that Dauber was a \\"hot-head\\" and believed he should have had more power in the rackets he was involved in. He was suspected of running several \\"competing\\" rackets that were not sanctioned by The Outfit and for which he did not \\"kick up\\" for. On July 2, 1980, the Daubers received a continuation from Judge Angelo Pistilli on charges accusing the couple of concealing cocaine and weapons in their suburban residence. While leaving the Will County courthouse, Dauber answered to reporters regarding his criminal activities, \\"I just live quietly in this country, that's all.\\" While driving home from the courthouse, unidentified gunmen (in the Family Secrets case it was said that the hitmen were Frank Calabrese Sr., Ronnie Jarrett, Butch Petrocelli and Gerry Scarpelli) driving a Ford van drove up alongside them and began firing at the car. Dauber, attempting to avoid the gunfire, crashed the car into an apple tree where, after being set on fire, it was later found by two farmers (the van was later found abandoned only a mile up the road). The incident was confessed to by Geri Scarpelli‚Äîa longtime associate of The Outfit. Further reading *Chiocca, Olindo Romeo. Mobsters and Thugs: Quotes from the Underworld.

The subject of a two-year federal undercover operation, DeCarlo's conviction revealed widespread corruption of New Jersey public officials and tied singer Frank Sinatra to organized crime. Early years DeCarlo was born in Hoboken, New Jersey on September 2, 1902. He represented Genovese family business interests in the New Jersey underworld; he was an associate of Abner \\"Longey\\" Zwillman and Gerardo Catena. DeCarlo was an excellent cook; his specialty was fried pasta with anchovies. His wife died mysteriously after giving birth. He reportedly later married a woman named Frances Ryan and had two children. His arrest record included income tax evasion, breaking and entering, counterfeiting, robbery, and liquor law violations. DeCarlo owned the La Martinique Tavern in Mountainside, New Jersey Based in New Jersey, DeCarlo rose to the position of caporegime, or captain, of a crew. He achieved this promotion by gaining control over the loansharking, or \\"juice\\" racket, illegal gambling, and murder for hire. DeCarlo also systematically eliminated his rival mobsters during the late 1950s. Mob career =Wiretapping= Between 1961 and 1963, federal agents began wire tapping conversations between DeCarlo and his mob associates. These wire taps revealed corruption among law enforcement, prominent businessmen and state officials including Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio and influential Hudson County politician John J. Kenny. Both Addonizio's and Kenny's political careers ended after the wire transcripts were published. The transcripts also mentioned Sinatra. On one tape, DeCarlo discussed methods for committing murder; he described a so-called \\"humane\\" hit in which he shot a victim through the heart. According to DeCarlo, it was a painless way to die. =Saperstein death= In September 1968, DeCarlo and his men brutalized Louis Saperstein, who owed DeCarlo $400,000. Government witness and former mob associate Gerald Zelmanowitz described an intense beating of Saperstein in DeCarlo's office due to a $5,000 monthly interest payment. Zelmanowitz said Saperstein was lying on the floor, looking purple, his tongue hanging out, and he was covered in blood and spit. On November 26, 1968, Saperstein died of arsenic poisoning. That same day, the FBI received a letter from Saperstein that detailed his problems with DeCarlo.\\"A Tale of Two Tapes\\" The Mafia in New Jersey In March 1970, DeCarlo was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\\"Frank Sinatra and the Mob\\" Crime Magazine =Presidential pardon= After DeCarlo served 18 months in prison, President Richard Nixon pardoned him, ostensibly due to his poor health. DeCarlo himself claimed to be dying of cancer. Disregarding the usual protocol, U.S. Attorney General Richard Kleindienst approved the pardon request and sent it to White House Counsel John Dean. Dean then delivered the request directly to Nixon. It was rumored that Vice President Spiro Agnew, a personal friend of Frank Sinatra, persuaded Nixon to approve the request.The Mob's President: Richard Nixon's Secret Ties to the Mafia by Don Fulsom Special Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox later investigated the DeCarlo pardon, but found no evidence of corruption. In December 1972, DeCarlo was released from prison. He died in Mountainside, New Jersey on October 20, 1973. This was five days before a deadline to pay a $20,000 fine from his 1970 conviction. He was buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey. The funeral was scheduled for the afternoon but was held in the morning because \\"the family just didn't want any more publicity.\\" In popular culture DeCarlo is portrayed by actor Christopher Walken in the 2014 film Jersey Boys about Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons.

Clarke. It was originally published in 1971 and has since been included in the anthology Nebula Award Stories Eight as well as several collections of Clarke's writings. A sequel, The Medusa Chronicles, was published in 2016 as a collaborative effort between Alastair Reynolds and Stephen Baxter. Plot summary Taking place partly on Earth and partly in the atmosphere of Jupiter, the story tells of Howard Falcon, the captain of a new and experimental giant-sized helium-filled airship. When an accident causes the ship to crash, Falcon is badly injured and takes over a year to fully recover. Later, Falcon promotes an expedition to explore the atmosphere of Jupiter. After several years and many trials, the expedition is launched, with Falcon at the controls of the Kon-Tiki, a hot-hydrogen balloon-supported craft that descends through the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. As the craft descends through the various cloud layers, Falcon discovers that the atmosphere supports at least two large forms of life, as well as microscopic and bioluminescent air plankton, producing atmospheric sea-fire. One form is a giant jellyfish-like creature (the Medusa of the title) about a mile across, and the others are manta ray-like creatures about a hundred yards wide that apparently prey on the Medusa. The Medusa begins to show an interest in the Kon-Tiki, and for his own and the expedition's safety, Falcon ignites his emergency power and escapes back into the upper atmosphere. After his return, it is revealed to the reader that because of the airship accident much of Falcon's body was replaced by prosthetics, making him a cyborg with increased speed and reactions - allowing him to venture further into deep space than anyone, while leaving him feeling distanced from other humans. Influence The story was the inspiration for The Medusa Encounter, the fourth novel in the Venus Prime series by Paul Preuss. The concept of life on Jupiter was explored in the second episode of Carl Sagan's 1980 PBS series Cosmos, which featured lifeforms similar in concept to those in this story. Clarke himself revisited the notion of giant lifeforms in the atmosphere of Jupiter in his 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two. Ben Bova's 2011 novel Leviathans of Jupiter, part of his Grand Tour series, features giant creatures called \\"Clarke's Medusas\\" living in the planet's atmosphere.

After the retirement of family boss Nicholas Delmore (real name Nicholas Amoruso)Mafia: the government's secret file on organized crime By United States. Dept. of the Treasury (pg. 284) between 1960 and 1964, DeCavalcante replaced him. Shortly after that, he acted as a liaison between the Mafia Commission and the Bonanno crime family after the beginning of the Bonanno War between the New York Five Families. From 1961 to 1965, DeCavalcante was the subject of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation known as the \\"Goodfella Tapes\\". This investigation confirmed claims by informant Joe Valachi, provided crucial information on La Cosa Nostra, and revealed the existence of the Mafia Commission. However, since no court order was issued for the wire tap, none of tapes could be used to indict DeCavalcante. In 1969, after compiling almost 2,300 transcript pages of taped conversations, the FBI released them to the public.Taping the Mafia, Time Magazine, June 20, 1969 Later in 1969, DeCavalcante was convicted of extortion-conspiracy and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment.

Large inboard convex surface is separated from small outboard aspheric surface. Side mirror with integrated turn signal repeater Side mirror with warning legend A side-view mirror (or side mirror), also known as a wing mirror, is a mirror placed on the exterior of motor vehicles for the purposes of helping the driver see areas behind and to the sides of the vehicle, outside the driver's peripheral vision (in the \\"blind spot\\"). Almost all modern cars mount their side mirrors on the doors‚Äînormally at the A-pillar‚Äîrather than the wings (the portion of the body above the wheel well) The side mirror is equipped for manual or remote vertical and horizontal adjustment so as to provide adequate coverage to drivers of differing height and seated position. Remote adjustment may be mechanical by means of bowden cables, or may be electric by means of geared motors. The mirror glass may also be electrically heated and may include electrochromic dimming to reduce glare to the driver from the headlamps of following vehicles. Increasingly, the side mirror incorporates the vehicle's turn signal repeaters. There is evidence to suggest mirror-mounted repeaters may be more effective than repeaters mounted in the previously predominant fender side location. Side mirror on Korean-spec vehicle. Legend in Korean reads \\"Objects in mirror are closer than they appear\\". Driver's control for side mirrors, with tiny curb- view button Optional side mirror In the 1940s many roads were unpaved and had two lanes, one in each direction. Drivers had to be aware only of traffic on their side and directly behind them (rear view). Due to this, most passenger vehicles with an internal rear-view mirror until the late 1960s had the passenger-side mirror only as an optional addition, as it was considered a luxury. Planar, convex, aspheric In the U.S. and Canada, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 and the Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 require the driver side mirror to provide \\"unit magnification\\", i.e., an undistorted 1:1 reflection achieved with a flat mirror. However, unit magnification limits the field of view that can be provided by a mirror of size compatible with the vehicle body. The ECE regulations in use throughout most of the world except North America permit the driver side mirror to have a planar, convex, or aspheric surface; an aspheric section is often combined with a larger convex section, and the two sections are separated by a visible line to alert the driver to the two sections' different perspective shifts. Because of the distance from the driver's eye to the passenger side mirror, a useful field of view can be achieved only with a convex or aspheric mirror. However, the convexity also minifies the objects shown. Since such objects seem farther away than they actually are, a driver might make a maneuver such as a lane change assuming an adjacent vehicle is a safe distance behind, when in fact it is quite a bit closer. In the United States, Canada, India, Korea and Australia, non-planar mirrors are etched or printed with the warning legend . In Canada, this warning is often supplemented by a transparent decal on the passenger side window repeating the warning in French: . In Korea, the warning appears in Korean. Warnings of this nature are not required in Europe.Side mirror retraction control =Other requirements= More commonly in cars manufactured since the 2000s, side mirrors may be manually or electrically folded in, to protect them when the car is parked or being washed in an automated car wash. Passing cars can easily clip protruding side mirrors; the folding capability helps protect them from harm. ECE Regulation 46 requires that side mirrors be mounted such that they swing away when struck by a test cylinder meant to represent a pedestrian. Until March 1983, the Japanese Ministry of Transport did not allow to register cars without mirrors on front fenders,Mainichi Shimbun 19 March 1983 morning p. 22 so the mirrors were mounted far forward atop the front fenders. More recent Japanese-specification vehicles have side mirrors similar to those in other countries. Taxi drivers and other professional drivers retain a preference for the wing-mounted mirrors as they feel that they work better in extremely tight traffic. U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 requires that convex side view mirrors must have a curvature radius of between 889 mm and 1651 mm. Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 111 stipulates a range of between 890 mm and 1800 mm. Neither the U.S. nor the Canadian standard allows for aspheric mirrors. The European ECE Regulation 46 used throughout most of the world permits planar, convex, and/or aspheric mirrors on either side of the vehicle. American research suggests non-planar driver side mirrors may help reduce crashes.

D'Elia's business background in solid waste brokering and other areas would later be useful in making contacts in New York, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. Rising through the ranks, D'Elia was said to be a mediator among mob families, meeting frequently with mobsters from the Philadelphia crime family, Western Pennsylvania, and New York City.

Built in response to a naval expansion program of the British Royal Navy, she was one of a group of five roughly similar battleships, including Mass√©na, Bouvet, Carnot, and Charles Martel. Jaur√©guiberry was armed with a mixed battery of , and guns. Constraints on displacement imposed by the French naval command produced a series of ships that were significantly inferior to their British counterparts, suffering from poor stability and a mixed armament that was difficult to control in combat conditions. In peacetime the ship participated in routine training exercises and cruises in the Mediterranean Sea, primarily as part of the Mediterranean Squadron. The ship was involved in several accidents, including a boiler explosion and an accidental torpedo detonation that delayed her entry into service in 1897. Two more torpedo explosions occurred in 1902 and 1905, and she ran aground during a visit to Portsmouth in August 1905. By 1907, she had been transferred to the Reserve Division, although she continued to participate in maneuvers and other peacetime activities. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Jaur√©guiberry escorted troop convoys from North Africa and India to France. She supported French troops during the Gallipoli Campaign, including during the landing at Cape Helles in April 1915, before she became guardship at Port Said from 1916 until the end of the war. Upon her return to France in 1919 she became an accommodation hulk until 1932. The ship was sold for scrap in 1934. Background and design Right elevation and section, from Brassey's Naval Annual 1897 In 1889, the British Royal Navy passed the Naval Defence Act, which resulted in the construction of the eight s; this major expansion of naval power led the French government to respond with the Statut Naval (Naval Law) of 1890. The law called for twenty-four \\"cuirasses d'escadre\\" (squadron battleships) and a host of other vessels, including coastal-defense battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats. The first stage of the program was to be a group of four squadron battleships built to different designs, but meeting the same basic requirements, including armor, armament, and displacement. The naval high command issued the basic characteristics on 24 December 1889; displacement should not exceed , the main battery was to consist of and guns, the belt armor should be , and the ships should maintain a top speed of . The secondary armament was to be either or caliber, with as many guns fitted as space would allow. The basic design for the ships was based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. Although the navy had stipulated that displacement could be up to 14,000 metric tons, political considerations, namely parliamentary objections to increases in naval expenditures, led the designers to limit displacement to around . Five naval architects submitted proposals to the competition. The design for Jaur√©guiberry was prepared by Amable Lagane, the director of naval construction at the Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e shipyard in La Seyne-sur-Mer. Lagane had previously supervised the construction of the Magenta-class ironclad , which influenced his design for Jaur√©guiberry. Though the program called for four ships to be built in the first year, five were ultimately ordered: Jaur√©guiberry, , , , and . Jaur√©guiberry used a very similar hull form to Marceaus, and as a result, was shorter and wider than the other vessels. The design for Jaur√©guiberry was also influenced by the Chilean battleship , then under construction in France (and which also had been designed by Lagane). A small vessel, Capit√°n Prat had adopted twin-gun turrets for her secondary battery to save space that would have been taken up by traditional casemate mountings. Lagane incorporated that solution in Jaur√©guiberry, though she was the only French battleship of the program to use that arrangement owing to fears that the rate of fire would be reduced and that the turrets would be more vulnerable to being disabled by a single lucky hit. She was the first French battleship to use electric motors to operate her main-battery turrets. She and her half-sisters were disappointments in service; they generally suffered from stability problems, and Louis-√âmile Bertin, the Director of Naval Construction in the late 1890s, referred to the ships as \\"chavirables\\" (prone to capsizing). All five of the vessels compared poorly to their British counterparts, particularly their contemporaries of the . The ships suffered from a lack of uniformity of equipment, which made them hard to maintain in service, and their mixed gun batteries comprising several calibers made gunnery in combat conditions difficult, since the splashes of relatively similarly sized shells were hard to differentiate and thus made it difficult to calculate corrections to hit the target. Many of the problems that plagued the ships in service were a result of the limitation on their displacement, particularly their stability and seakeeping. =General characteristics and machinery= Jaur√©guiberry was long overall. She had a maximum beam of and a draft of . She displaced at normal load and at full load. She was fitted with two heavy military masts with fighting tops. In 1905 her captain described her as an excellent sea-boat and a good fighting ship, although her secondary armament was too light. He also said that she was stable and well laid-out with good living conditions. She had a crew of 631 officers and enlisted sailors. Jaur√©guiberry had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, also built by Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e, which were designed to give the ship a speed of . On trials they developed and drove the ship to a maximum speed of . Each engine drove a propeller. Twenty-four Lagraffel d'Allest water-tube boilers provided steam for the engines at a pressure of . The boilers were distributed between six boiler rooms and were ducted into a pair of closely spaced funnels. She normally carried of coal, but could carry a maximum of . This gave her a radius of action of at . =Armament= Line-drawing showing the arrangement and firing arcs of the ship's main battery Jaur√©guiberrys main armament consisted of two 45-caliber Canon de Mod√®le 1887 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. A pair of 45-caliber Canon de Mod√®le 1887 guns were mounted in single-gun wing turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the tumblehome of the ship's sides. Each 305 mm turret had an arc of fire of 250¬∞. The 305 mm guns fired cast iron (CI) projectiles, or heavier armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells at a muzzle velocity of . The 274 mm guns were also supplied with a mix of CI, AP, and SAP shells, with the same muzzle velocity as the larger guns. The ship's offensive armament was completed by a secondary battery of eight 45-caliber Canon de Mod√®le 1891 guns mounted in manually operated twin-gun turrets. The turrets were placed at the corners of the superstructure with 160¬∞ arcs of fire. They fired CI or AP or SAP shells at a muzzle velocity of . Defense against torpedo boats was provided by a variety of light-caliber weapons. Sources disagree on the number and types, possibly indicating changes over the ship's lifetime. All sources agree on four 50-caliber () guns. These fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . Gibbons and Gardiner agree on twelve, later eighteen, although d'Ausson lists fourteen, 40-caliber Canon de 47 mm Mod√®le 1885 Hotchkiss guns that were mounted in the fighting tops and on the superstructure. They fired a projectile at to a maximum range of . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute, but only seven rounds per minute sustained. Gibbons and Gardiner agree that eight Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns were mounted on the fore and aft superstructures, although none are listed by d'Ausson. The ship was initially fitted with torpedo tubes, though sources disagree on the number. Gardiner states that she had two submerged tubes and two above-water tubes, but d'Ausson states that she had six tubes, two each above water in the bow and stern and one on each broadside underwater. The above-water tubes were removed during a refit in 1906. The M1892 torpedoes carried a warhead, and could be set at or , which could reach targets at or , respectively. =Armor= Jaur√©guiberry had a total of of nickel-steel armor; equal to 33.5% of her normal displacement. Her waterline belt ranged from in thickness. Above the belt was a thick strake of side armor that created a highly divided cofferdam. Around the above-water torpedo tubes, the upper strake increased to . The armored deck rested on the top of the waterline belt. Her 305 mm gun turrets were protected by of armor on the sides and faces while her 274 mm turrets had of armor. The ship's secondary turrets were protected by of armor. The walls of her conning tower were thick. Service Jaur√©guiberry was ordered on 8 April 1891 and laid down on 23 April at Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e in La Seyne-sur- Mer. She was launched on 27 October 1893 and was complete enough to begin her sea trials on 30 January 1896. A tube in one of her boilers burst on 10 June during a 24-hour engine trial, killing six and wounding three. Two months later she suffered an accident while testing her main armament. She was finally commissioned on 16 February 1897, although the explosion of a torpedo's air chamber on 30 March delayed her assignment to the Mediterranean Squadron until 17 May. During this period, she was fitted with a new electric order-transmission system that relayed instructions from the ship's fire- control center to the guns, a marked improvement over the voice tubes that were in standard use in the world's navies at the time. Immediately on entering service, she and her half-sisters Charles Martel and Carnot were sent to join the International Squadron that had been assembled beginning in February. The multinational force also included ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the Imperial German Navy, the Italian Regia Marina, the Imperial Russian Navy, and the British Royal Navy, and it was sent to intervene in the 1897‚Äì1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. Throughout the ship's peacetime career, she was occupied with routine training exercises, which included gunnery training, combined maneuvers with torpedo boats and submarines, and practice attacks on coastal fortifications. One of the largest of these exercises was conducted between March and July 1900, and involved the Mediterranean Squadron and the Northern Squadron. On 6 March, Jaur√©guiberry joined the battleships Brennus, , , Charles Martel, and Bouvet and four protected cruisers for maneuvers off Golfe-Juan, including night- firing training. Over the course of April, the ships visited numerous French ports along the Mediterranean coast, and on 31 May the fleet steamed to Corsica for a visit that lasted until 8 June. After completing its own exercises in the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean Squadron rendezvoused with the Northern Squadron off Lisbon, Portugal, in late June before proceeding to Quiberon Bay for joint maneuvers in July. The maneuvers concluded with a naval review in Cherbourg on 19 July for President √âmile Loubet. On 1 August, the Mediterranean Squadron departed for Toulon, arriving on 14 August. Jaur√©guiberry at Spithead in 1905 On 20 January 1902 the air chamber of another torpedo exploded, killing one sailor and wounding three. In September she transported the Minister of the Navy to Bizerte. By this time, the ship had been assigned to the 2nd Battle Division of the Mediterranean Squadron, along with Bouvet and the new battleship , the latter becoming the divisional flagship. In October, Jaur√©guiberry and the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron battleships steamed to Palma de Mallorca, and on the return to Toulon they conducted training exercises. Jaur√©guiberry was transferred to the Northern Squadron in 1904, her place in the Mediterranean Squadron being taken by the new battleship . Jaur√©guiberry arrived at Brest on 25 March. She was lightly damaged when she touched a rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July and, in another incident, her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air chamber burst between her screws during a torpedo-launching exercise on 18 May 1905. While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August, Jaur√©guiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbor. She returned to the Mediterranean Squadron in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division, and the following year was reassigned to the 3rd Division. On 13 January 1908, she joined the battleships , , Gaulois, Charlemagne, , and Mass√©na for a cruise in the Mediterranean, first to Golfe-Juan and then to Villefranche-sur-Mer, where the squadron stayed for a month. In 1909, the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910. Beginning on 29 September 1910 her boiler tubes were renewed in a four- month refit at Cherbourg. On 4 September 1911, she participated in a naval review off Toulon. In October 1912 the Squadron was reassigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and a year later, in October 1913, Jaur√©guiberry was transferred to the Training Division. During this period, she was fitted with an experimental fire-control system as part of a series of tests before it was installed in the new dreadnought battleships. She became the flagship of the Special Division in April 1914; in August, the commander of the division was Contre-amiral (Rear Admiral) Darrieus. At that time, the division also included the battleship Charlemagne and the cruisers and . =World War I= Jaur√©guiberry in Port Said in 1915 Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, France announced general mobilization on 1 August. The next day, Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re ordered the entire French fleet to begin raising steam at 22:15 so the ships could sortie early the next day. The bulk of the fleet, including the Division de compl√©ment, was sent to French North Africa, where they escorted the vital troop convoys carrying elements of the French Army from North Africa back to France to counter the expected German invasion. The French fleet was tasked with guarding against a possible attack by the German battlecruiser , which instead fled to the Ottoman Empire. As part of her mission, Jaur√©guiberry was sent to Oran, French Algeria on 4 August, in company with Bouvet, Suffren, and Gaulois. She also escorted a convoy of Indian troops passing through the Mediterranean in September. Beginning in December, Jaur√©guiberry was stationed at Bizerte, remaining there until February 1915 when she sailed to Port Said to become flagship of the Syrian Division, commanded by Admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet. At that time, the division included Saint Louis, the coast defence battleship , and D'Entrecasteaux. On 25 March, Jaur√©guiberry departed Port Said for the Dardanelles, where the French and British fleets were attempting to break through the Ottoman defenses guarding the straits. An earlier Anglo-French attack on 18 March had cost the French fleet the battleship Bouvet, and two other battleships‚ÄîSuffren and Gaulois‚Äîhad been badly damaged and forced to withdraw. To make good his losses, Admiral √âmile Gu√©pratte requested that Jaur√©guiberry and Saint Louis be transferred to his command. On 1 April, Gu√©pratte transferred his flag from Charlemagne to Jaur√©guiberry. By late May, the French squadron had been restored to effective strength, and included the battleships Saint Louis, Charlemagne, Patrie, Suffren, and Henri IV. The formation was designated the 3rd Battle Division. Jaur√©guiberry provided gunfire support to the troops during the Landing at Cape Helles on 25 April, during which the French forces made a diversionary landing on the Asian side of the straits. During the operation, Jaur√©guiberry and the other French ships kept the Ottoman guns on that side of the strait largely suppressed, and prevented them from interfering with the main landing at Cape Helles. She continued operations in the area until 26 May, including supporting the Allied attack during the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May. She was lightly damaged by Turkish artillery on 30 April and 5 May, but continued to fire her guns as needed. Jaur√©guiberry was recalled to Port Said on 19 July and bombarded Ottoman-controlled Haifa on 13 August. She resumed her role as flagship of the Syrian Division on 19 August. The ship participated in the occupation of Ile Rouad on 1 September and other missions off the Syrian coast until she was transferred to Ismailia in January 1916 to assist in the defense of the Suez Canal, although she returned to Port Said shortly afterward. Jaur√©guiberry was refitted at Malta between 25 November and 26 December 1916, thereafter returning to Port Said. She landed some of her guns to help defend the canal in 1917 and was reduced to reserve in 1918. The ship arrived at Toulon on 6 March 1919 where she was decommissioned and transferred to the Engineer's Training School on 30 March for use as an accommodation hulk. She was struck from the Navy List on 20 June 1920, but remained assigned to the Engineer's School until 1932. Jaur√©guiberry was sold for scrap on 23 June 1934 for the price of 1,147,000 francs.

It is a \\"comedy of ideas\\" which was published in 1995. It is set in a fictional world, and its primary source of humour is based upon the allusions Lukes makes to this world. The plot follows Professor Nicholas Caritat, who is an allusion himself to Marquis de Condorcet, a French Enlightenment scholar.  Plot summary  In the military run country of Militaria, Professor Nicholas Caritat, a secluded Enlightenment scholar, is arrested because he has been giving hope to the Optimists, the nation‚Äôs enemies. Once in prison, he is rescued by Justin, a former student and current part of a guerrilla group called \\"the Hand,\\" and given a mission: to find the best possible world. The mission leads him through three countries of political extremes that all claim to be the best. Nicholas‚Äôs mission begins in Calcula, a city in the forward thinking, Utilitarian country named Utilitaria. The country has two parties: the Rule party, in government and the Act party, in opposition. The Ruler party follows John Stuart Mill‚Äôs idea of having society be ruled mainly by the most talented individuals. The Act party encourages democracy as it follows Jeremy Bentham‚Äôs ideas of having everyone‚Äôs opinions count equally in government. There is a group in the Northern area of the country called the Bigotarians which are focused on the past and want independence. The only thing that matters to the people of Utilitaria is producing the greatest utility, as that will produce the greatest amount of happiness, following the ideas of early utilitarian thinkers. Classes are non-existent. Calculators and computers are used to calculate consequences and utility, despite the limitations and difficulties that occur when trying to do so. Everyone is cared for, provided that they contribute to the well-being of society. Those who cannot contribute are used as organ donors to help the working force. On the third day of his visit, he is kidnapped by the Bigotarians. The group holds him for ransom as they think he is a Utilitarian ideologist. After thirteen days and two letters to the man he had been staying with, Nicolas realizes that Utilitaria, with its lack of regard for human rights, is not the best possible world. He is soon released and finds his way to Polygopolis, Communitaria with the help of Reverend Goddington Thwaite. In Communitaria, society is based on equality and multiculturalism. People are greatly attached to their own ways of life, but recognize and accept others‚Äô. Everyone has a place in one of the thirty-four ethnic groups and seventeen religions. People cannot change communities to which they belong, but instead have to conform. The right to practice their culture is balanced by law with the responsibility to never offend another community. Nicholas meets a rock star who is hiding because he had been excommunicated from his communities because he wrote a \\"satirical\\" rock opera. Satire is seen as sacrilegious, which is the worst crime in Communitaria, so he no longer has a place in society. Reverend Goddington Thwaite and the rock star look to Nicholas to help. When he talks to the two communities, though, he finds that individual rights do not exist in Communitaria. The only right that exists is the right the communities have to be respected. Upon visiting the unidiversity (the Communitarians‚Äô university), he is told that his mission undermines multiculturalism. It, according to the professors there, implies that one culture or society is better than another, which is impossible to do if one wants to have multiculturalism. Despite this, he is offered a temporary position lecturing on \\"Did the Enlightenment have to fail\\". The intent of this suggested topic is to warn students against ethnocentrism and the idea of civilization and universal reason. They view the Enlightenment as a way for one culture to oppress others, which is unacceptable in their world. One of the professors, Professor Bodkin, is an extreme feminist who argues that there is still oppression in the country on the basis of gender. Her peers avoid her eyes as she speaks of this, as they prefer to believe that there no longer is oppression. When Nicholas meets a group of students, he finds that free speech is a punishable offence for fear of offending someone. He is invited to a secret club by another group of students, though, who argue against that. Through their stories, he finds the problem behind the Communitarian way of life: extreme separation of the communities. Marriage between members of different communities is frowned upon. People who try to change their community are shunned from society and called \\"rootless cosmopolitans\\". While trying to find the washroom, he finds Professor Bodkin in the shower. When she sees him, he stumbles out, making apologies. She mistakes his apologies for insults against her community. She presses charges against him, causing him to flee the country to Freedom. On the train ride to Freedom, he dreams of the perfect world. In the dream, he meets two men who show him around Proletaria. Like Marx‚Äôs ideology, the Proletarian class in Proletaria took over the government which caused the state to disintegrate and left complete communism. There are no classes, states, legal systems, wages, rights, or markets. People are free to do as they wish and are not confined to one particular area of labour or activity. Upon waking, he finds himself heading towards Freedom, the capital city of Libertaria. Based on libertarian thinking, \\"society\\" no longer exists in the country; all that matters is the individual. People are completely left alone as the government does not believe in social programs. Everything is privatized, so schools and hospitals are closed to those who cannot pay for them. Freedom arises in that people are free to do whatever they like without interference from the government. The market, as once stated by Steven Lukes, reproduces and creates inequalities. This is shown in Libertaria through the difficulties people have living in society. The entire state is built on the privatization and trade of various programs and industries on the stock market. Due to this, it is difficult to find work. People often have to live on the streets, while students do not have enough money to buy books. The only way to make money is through stocks, but it is only the wealthy that have the money to do that, creating inequalities. After limited success in Libertaria, he leaves to Minerva, and then starts to walk to the border. On his way, he is confronted by an owl who explains why each country failed to be the best it could be: they were all too focused on a single value. Since this is the Owl of Minerva, it is wise and philosophical. As dusk approaches, the owl flies away, symbolizing, as German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel says, that \\"philosophy understands reality only after the event.\\" Nicholas, demonstrating this, starts to comprehend all that has happened. His final letter to Justin places his experiences in context with his mission and ideas. He realizes that the best possible world would encompass all values and have its citizens willing to learn and think. References # * (2006-11-6) Liska, Jasmine.

When one of the pulsing white rings scattered around the level is collected, the robot becomes temporarily invulnerable and can safely touch the fireballs, destroying them. In each level the player begins with 100 units of energy and loses units at a rate of about one per second, making quick completion of each level important. When the energy runs out, the player loses a robot. Points are granted in 10 point increments as the robot advances through the level. Collecting a ring earns 100 points, as does collecting the small musical note at the beginning of the level that turns off the game's sound effects. Dispatching a fireball is worth 500 points. Completing a level earns 100 points per unit of energy remaining on the screen. Later levels include bombs and magnets. There are a total of 22 levels, not counting the 26 customized levels. Reception Mr. Robot and His Robot Factory was reviewed by Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was compared to Miner 2049er and described as \\"sufficiently different [...] to represent an enthralling new test of skill\\". The reviewers praised the efforts of programmer Ron Rosen, noting that \\"the programming skill evidenced in the preparation of Mr. Robot is awesome,\\" and concluding \\"what this game lacks in stark originality, it more than makes up for with polish\\".

It follows a series of violent murders centered around a Los Angeles apartment complex, followed by the kidnapping and disappearance of a teenage girl who resides there. The film was marketed as being a dramatization of a true story, and was briefly banned in the early 1980s in the United Kingdom during the \\"video nasty\\" panic. It has garnered a cult following in the years since its release, and been cited by horror writer Stephen King as one of his favorite horror films.  Plot  A man dressed in black drives through Los Angeles. Near a car dealership, the man has a flashback of a car accident that occurred at the site which killed a young woman. The man arrives at an apartment complex and kills Mrs. Andrews, a female tenant (who recognizes him) with an electric drill. Afterward, the man dons a ski mask and murders two other women, the first with a hammer and the second with a screwdriver. The police are called and they interview the people who found the bodies, as well as Vance Kingsley, the owner of the building. The next night, the killer strikes again, breaking into the apartment of a woman who is masturbating in her bathtub and shooting her in the stomach and head with a nail gun. The murderer then abducts Laurie Ballard, a fifteen-year-old who lives in the above apartment with her family. Laurie's brother Joey is questioned by Detective Jamison and, frustrated by the detective's seemingly lax attitude towards Laurie's disappearance, decides to search for his sister on his own. While looking through the homes of the murdered women, Joey meets up with Kent, Vance's nephew, who has been hired to clean up the apartments of the deceased tenants. While Joey is helping Kent, Kent mentions that Vance has not been the same since Kathy, (his cousin and Vance's daughter), died in a car accident. It is revealed that Vance is the serial killer, having been driven insane and to religious mania by the death of his daughter. He is killing sinners and has kidnapped Laurie (who is kept tied up and gagged in Kathy's bedroom) to replace Kathy. During a discussion with Detective Jamison, Joey realizes that all the clues point to Vance being the killer, so he goes to the Kingsley house and is followed there by Kent (who had earlier seen the bound and gagged Laurie in his uncle's home). Joey finds bloody tools in Vance's garage, and is confronted by Kent, who sets Joey on fire‚Äîburning him to death‚Äîto protect his family. Kent walks in on Vance talking to Laurie, and enrages his uncle by telling him that he and Kathy had an incestuous relationship. Vance and Kent fight, and Kent ends up fatally stabbing Vance with a kitchen knife. Kent goes to Laurie, cuts her bonds and rapes her. Afterward, Kent acts as if he and Laurie are married and implies that he killed Joey and Vance, prompting Laurie to stab him to death with a pair of scissors. A dazed and bloodied Laurie wanders out of the house, as an intertitle states that the film was a dramatization of events that occurred in 1967 and that Laurie was institutionalized for three years and now resides in San Fernando Valley with her husband and their child.  Cast  Production =Development= Development for The Toolbox Murders began in 1977 when Los Angeles producer Tony Didio wanted to make a low-budget horror film after noticing a successful second release of Tobe Hooper's landmark horror film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Didio had been intrigued by the film's financial success and, knowing the film's distributors, contacted them inquiring why the film was being re-released so soon. After a conversation with the film's distributors, Didio decided that he would release his own low- budget horror film. Didio screened the film with writers Ann Kindberg, Robert Easter and Neva Friedenn, giving them the mandate to create a variation of Hooper's landmark film. According to journalist Linda Gross, the screenplay was loosely based on a string of serial killings in Michigan committed by a man who attacked women using various tools. =Casting= Wesley Eure was cast in the role of Vance's nephew, Kent, who helps clean the apartment, and who in fact turns out to be an accomplice to his uncle's killings. Eure, who had previously appeared on the series Land of the Lost‚Äîwhich had recently been canceled at that time‚Äîagreed to take the role as he had been tired of taking \\"goody-goody roles. I'd been running from dinosaurs and being the perfect son for years, and now I got to be the killer!\\" =Filming= Principal photography of The Toolbox Murders began in the summer of 1977 in Canoga Park, Los Angeles at locations on Sherman Way and Vanowen Streets. The film was shot over a total of 18 days, on a budget of approximately $165,000.  Release  =Box office= The Toolbox Murders was released theatrically in the United States by Cal-Am Artists, The film was put out on VHS by VCI Entertainment. opening regionally in El Paso, Texas on February 17, 1978. By mid-1978, the film had grossed $512,000 at ninety theaters in the United States. It had its Los Angeles premiere on November 1, 1978. In 1979, it was selected for screening at the 12th International Festival de Cine Fant√°stico y de Terror in Sitges, Spain. =Censorship= The film was briefly on the list of the video nasties and was initially banned in the United Kingdom before being subsequently acquitted in court and removed from the Director of Public Prosecutions' (DPP) list. = Critical reception = Upon its release, critics complained about the film's misogynistic views towards victimization, and exploitation of women along with its graphic violence and nudity. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times lambasted the film as \\"degenerate, unmotivated, and pornographic trash,\\" summarizing Donnelly's direction as \\"flaccid and voyeuristic.\\" Fred Beldin from The New York Times criticized the film's characters and villains as \\"clumsily expressed\\" and called the films conclusion \\"incredibly silly\\" concluding, \\"as a result, the only enjoyment that can be obtained from the film is ultimately derisive\\". Robert Firsching from Allmovie called it \\"misogynistic\\" and \\"nasty\\", when talking about the film's murder scenes Firsching stated, \\"None of these things would be quite as shocking if not for the cast, most of whom (save for Cameron Mitchell and Nichols) might have wondered what they were doing in junk like this\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Verdict, said the film was \\"a cut above (no pun intended) your average exploitation horror film\\" though went on to say \\"if The Toolbox Murders has one major flaw, it is in the division between the gory slasher and neurotic thriller film\\" and \\"The first half is gruesome. The last half is unsettling. But they really are almost two different movies\\". Another review by the same website was also predominantly positive, stating \\"Sure it's got gore and nudity galore, but I think it's survived as long as it has because it completely upsets viewer expectations in its second half. By starting out as a typical slasher and ending as a psychological thriller, Toolbox gets under the skin in a way that sticking with one genre or another would not have\\". The review concluded by saying \\"it's gory side is gory enough and its creepy side creepy enough to make it worth a watch for those interested in exploitation fare\\" despite the flat middle half and unrealistic, twist-filled ending. Jacob Knight of the film criticism website Birth.Movies.Death. praised the film as a \\"blitzkrieg of brutal, Biblical violence,\\" adding: \\"Truth be told, The Toolbox Murders is a really nasty affair‚Äîutterly unpleasant up until its final moments. But Dennis Donnelly has crafted a San Fernando Valley slice of gnarly exploitation that's sure to please even the most hardcore horror hounds. While the mutilations comes fast and furious, there's not a whole lot of gore to speak of. Instead, there's a fatalistic tone that permeates every frame, reinforced by George Deaton's preposterously portentous score.\\" =Home media= The film was released on VHS by VCI/Anchor Bay on September 15, 1989. An edited DVD was released in the UK in 2000 by VIPCO, in 2017 an uncut version was released in the UK by 88 Films. The film was also released as a Special Edition DVD by Blue Underground in 2003, and was re-released on Blu-ray in 2010. Legacy The film has gained a cult following in the years after its release, and has been cited by author Stephen King as one of his favorite horror films. Scott Glosserman claimed to have put an easter egg in his film Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon with the character of Eugene being responsible for the toolbox murders. In 2004, Tobe Hooper directed a remake simply entitled Toolbox Murders. The film veered considerably from the original plotline but ultimately was better received than the original.

The scale is such that the fine grains of light represent collections of large numbers of superclusters. The Virgo Supercluster ‚Äì home of the Milky Way galaxy ‚Äì is at the center of a Hubble volume, but is too small to be seen in the image. In cosmology, a Hubble volume or Hubble sphere is a spherical region of the observable universe surrounding an observer beyond which objects recede from that observer at a rate greater than the speed of light due to the expansion of the Universe. The Hubble volume is approximately equal to 1031 cubic light years. The proper radius of a Hubble sphere (known as the Hubble radius or the Hubble length) is c/H_0, where c is the speed of light and H_0 is the Hubble constant. The surface of a Hubble sphere is called the microphysical horizon, the Hubble surface, or the Hubble limit. More generally, the term \\"Hubble volume\\" can be applied to any region of space with a volume of order (c/H_0)^3. However, the term is also frequently (but mistakenly) used as a synonym for the observable universe; the latter is larger than the Hubble volume.For a discussion of why objects that are outside the Earth's Hubble sphere can be seen from Earth, see For an example of mistaken usage, see Relationship to age of the universe The Hubble length c/H_0 is 14.4 billion light years in the standard cosmological model, somewhat larger than c times the age of the universe, 13.8 billion years. Hubble limit as an event horizon For objects at the Hubble limit the space between us and the object of interest has an average expansion speed of c. So, in a universe with constant Hubble parameter, light emitted at the present time by objects outside the Hubble limit would never be seen by an observer on Earth. That is, the Hubble limit would coincide with a cosmological event horizon (a boundary separating events visible at some time and those that are never visible). See Hubble horizon for more details. However, the Hubble parameter is not constant in various cosmological models so that the Hubble limit does not, in general, coincide with a cosmological event horizon. For example, in a decelerating Friedmann universe the Hubble sphere expands with time, and its boundary overtakes light emitted by more distant galaxies so that light emitted at earlier times by objects outside the Hubble sphere still may eventually arrive inside the sphere and be seen by us. Conversely, in an accelerating universe, the Hubble sphere shrinks with time, and its boundary overtakes light emitted by nearer galaxies so that light emitted at earlier times by objects inside the Hubble sphere will eventually recede outside the sphere and will never be seen by us. Observations indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, so that some objects that we can currently exchange signals with will one day cross our Hubble limit. However, from our perspective we could not observe such crossing only a \\"freeze', the associated redshift would grow asymptotically to infinity as such limit is approached.

The first member churches were received in 2005. According to information on its website, the ERPC's formation was in response to a perceived acceptance by churches such as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Presbyterian Church in America of departures from Biblical doctrine in a number of areas, including: *the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ alone, apart from good works *the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy *the teaching of baptismal regeneration *failure to discipline ministers, elders, and seminary professors who hold such views *the development of what the ERPC considers to be un-Presbyterian bureaucratic structures that impede discipline and undermine spiritual vitality in the churches. The ERPC was governed by a General Synod, presbyteries, and elders (sessions) elected by the local congregations. Under the denomination's Form of Government, local congregations delegated specific and limited powers to presbyteries and synods, designed to promote orthodoxy, evangelism, and the spiritual well-being of the membership while strongly limiting denominational bureaucracy. The ERPC was dissolved by a vote of member churches at a meeting of the Presbytery in October, 2015. The meeting was held at Grace Presbyterian Church in Hanover, Pennsylvania on October 16, 2015.

Vanderbeek, a New Jersey native and Devils season ticket holder since the late 1980s, bought a minority stake in the Devils when Puck Holdings, an affiliate of YankeeNets, purchased the team in 2000. In 2004, he bought the team outright and resigned his position as an executive vice president of Lehman Brothers, which he joined in 1984. Filed 2002-03-01. Retrieved on 2006-11-15. He was ranked the ninth highest paid executive of 2002 by Business Week with pay totaling over $29 million. Owner of the New Jersey Devils Vanderbeek has been a strong proponent of the Prudential Center, which hosted its first New Jersey Devils hockey game on October 27, 2007. In 2012, Vanderbeek finalized a deal with the team's lenders that allowed him to retain the franchise for at least two years. For the most part, Vanderbeek was a hands-off owner. He left the Devils' day-to-day operations in the hands of president and general manager Lou Lamoriello. In August 2013, a deal was reached where Josh Harris, owner of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, bought controlling interest in the Devils for over $320 million. Vanderbeek remained as a minority owner after the sale. High school football coach In December 2014, Vanderbeek was hired by Kyle Franey, Director of Athletics at Somerville High School, as co-head football coach. Somerville High School, one with a storied past, had lost 22 games in a row. In just his 4th game as head coach, on October 2, 2015, Somerville won its first home game in nearly four years. Somerville High School football had gone 2-28 in the three season prior to his arrival. In just Jeff Vanderbeek's second season as head coach \\"The Ville\\" ran off 10 straight wins, falling in the state semifinal to the eventual champion, Rumson-Fair Haven. Along the way the Pioneers recorded a Mid State Conference Mountain Division Championship and dubbed the season #TheRise, which is chronicled at www.somervillefootball.com. Their 25-game losing streak far in the rearview mirror, in 2017, The Ville, led by Jeffrey Vanderbeek won their second consecutive Mid State 38 Mountain Division Championship and added the NJSIAA Central Jersey Group 3 State Championship - The Pioneers first state title since 1994. After going 2-21 in their previous 23 games, \\"The Ville\\" under Jeffrey Vanderbeek turned their football program around to go 21-3 and won the Central Jersey Group 3 NJSIAA State Sectional Championship on December 2, 2017 at Rutgers High Point Solutions Stadium. After graduating 12 first team all conference players during an 11-1 season in 2016, The Ville was expected to have a rebuilding year, but in quite possibly the greatest turnaround in high school football history, Somerville Football defeated Rumson-Fair Haven to become state champions, defeating the 4 time defending state champions who had also won 8 of the last 9 sectional championships. #TheGrind became the motto of the season, and the 2017 team saw underclassman score 31 of the last 32 touchdowns of the season. For this unlikely and unprecedented turnaround Jeff Vanderbeek was named the area and state Coach of the Year.

The cross section in the mature portion is slightly wider than high, but is narrower laterally in the young. Sutures are straight and transverse. Endoceras has a large siphuncle, located close to the ventral margin, composed of concave segments, especially in the young but which may be tubular in the adult stage. Endocones are simple, subcircular in cross section, and penetrated by a narrow tube which may contain diaphragms reminiscent of the Ellesmerocerid ancestor. Specimen from Stevns, Denmark Endoceras was named by Hall in 1847. Distribution is widespread, especially in North America and Europe. Endoceras is similar to Cameroceras, the two may be synonymous, but differs from the genus Nanno in that the siphuncle in Nanno fills the entire apical portion of the shell while in Endoceras the siphuncle is ventral even there with septa formed at the onset. Mature, full grown, Endoceras were most likely ambush predators that lay in wait on the sea floor, moving when necessary to gain the advantage. Younger individuals with compressed cross sections may have been more actively mobile. Size A specimen of Endoceras giganteum at the Museum of Comparative Zoology measures 3 meters (9.8 ft) as preserved. The most recent estimate puts its complete size at 5.7 meters (18.7 ft). This would make it the largest cephalopod by length in the fossil record. There is additionally an unconfirmed report of a 9.1 meter (30 ft) shell that was destroyed. References *Teichert, C. 1964.

He is one of China's modern era pioneers in pop music and is considered China's King of Pop. He combines his music career with teaching the history of Western music at the Beijing University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Early life On August 26, 1963, Liu Huan was born into a family of teachers in Tianjin. Liu graduated from Yaohua High School in Tianjin in 1981. Four years later, he graduated from the University of International Relations in Beijing, majoring in French literature. During his university days, he participated in a French songwriting competition and won first prize, as well as sponsorship from the French government to go on a tour to Paris. Following that, Liu was sent to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in China for one year to help promote local education by teaching music there, and the time he spent there had an influence on his music. Liu never received any systematic training in music, but is self-taught. His classmates recall Liu Huan sitting on the stairs of his dorm, playing his guitar and singing songs until midnight. During his time in France, unlike his classmates who spent their time shopping and sightseeing, he went to bars in search of inspiration. Singing career Liu has performed the theme songs for a number of television series. In 1987, he performed his first song, Sun in Heart (ÂøÉ‰∏≠ÁöÑÂ§™Èò≥), for Snowing City (Èõ™Âüé). He is also well known for performing theme songs to historical television dramas, such as The One Who Wins the Hearts of the People Gains the Empire (ÂæóÊ∞ëÂøÉËÄÖÂæóÂ§©‰∏ã) for 1996 series Yongzheng Dynasty and Heroes' Song (Â•ΩÊ±âÊ≠å), for the 1998 series The Water Margin. His song, Asking Myself a Thousand Times (ÂçÉËê¨Ê¨°ÁöÑÂïè) remained in the top position for ten weeks on Chinese radio stations. In 1990, Liu performed the official theme song, Asian Mighty Winds (‰∫öÊ¥≤ÈõÑÈ£é), with Wei Wei at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. On 19 March 2004, Liu held the first concert in his 19-year career at the Capital Indoor Stadium, Beijing, called \\"Huange 2004\\" (Ê¨¢Ê≠å2004). Other singers included Na Ying, Sun Nan, Sha Baoliang and Warren Mok. In 2006, Liu held his second concert in the Shanghai Indoor Stadium, with fellow singers Na Ying, Sun Nan, Warren Mok and Song Zuying present as guests. On 3 July 2007, Liu, Liao Changyong and Warren Mok held a \\"Zhenhan\\" music concert in the Great Hall of the People, Beijing. The singers introduced a blend of popular and classical music in their performance. On 8 August 2008, Liu appeared in front the international audience when he performed the official theme song You and Me with British singer Sarah Brightman at the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Beijing. Huan was also featured in the 2008 Beijing Olympics song, Beijing Welcomes You. In 2012, Liu was asked to act as one of the four judges on The Voice of China, a singing talent show broadcast on Zhejiang TV. The other three judges are Na Ying, Yang Kun and Harlem Yu. Liu returned again in 2017 as a new coach in Sing! China (a rebrand of The Voice of China), and emerged as the winning mentor (his finalist, Tashi Phuntsok ÊâéË•øÂπ≥Êé™, won the season). In 2019, Liu returned to television to take part in the Hunan TV's long-running singing competition Singer (called I Am a Singer before 2017).On April 12, Liu was crowned the winner of Singer 2019. It was revealed on the final that the song he chose for the final round, which is a three-song medley themed for Empress Xiaoshengxian, was made in tribute to Yao Beina, one of the contestants from the second season of The Voice of China, who died on 16 January 2015, which received a standing ovation from the panel of 500-member judges, and won the season with 62.22% of the votes cast, the highest score attained so far in the history of I Am a Singer. Teaching career As well as being a singer-songwriter, Liu is also a teacher. He has taught at the University of International Relations and is currently teaching the history of Western music at the Beijing University of International Business and Economics. \\"It's a good idea to bring music to more students in China,\\" says Liu. Despite his pop career in China, Liu is not willing to give up his secondary job, teaching, which he considers to be a stable career. Liu has taught students for ten years, and he is very proud of the fact that he is one of the most popular teachers at the university. ‚ÄúThere doesn‚Äôt have to be any contradictions between being a singer and a teacher, although they are totally different jobs. I can focus on how to make students have more interest in music when I am in class, after that, I do have time to write songs. I am enjoying being a teacher.‚Äù His classes are crowded with other students besides his own students, who come to stand in the classroom to listen to his lectures. \\"Liu is perfect for us to carry out the plan because he is such an iconic figure in China's music industry,\\" says David Jin, president and country manager of China and Northeast Asia of Harman. ‚ÄúI am a teacher so I am close to the students and know their desire for music,\\" Liu Huan says. ‚ÄúUnlike our generation, today's students are active and curious about everything. They are not only interested in established musicians, but also new, alternative music.\\" Personal life Liu Huan married Lu Lu, a hostess for Hunan TV, in 1988. Their daughter was born in September 1991. Liu underwent hip replacement surgery at the Beijing University Third Hospital in mid-April 2010. The surgery was very successful. Liu has a round body, round face, and long braids, the image of Liu Huan is generally unchanging. He prefers to wear black to almost all of his performances. He wore a plain black T-shirt when singing at the 2008 Olympic opening ceremonies. Liu Huan had tried many hairstyles until he first opened in a concert overseas, when his hair was very long and he tied his hair back. From that time onwards, he has kept his hairstyle long, and thinks it is more convenient than other hairstyles. In December 26, 2018, on the same day Liu was announced as one of the contestants who would take part in Singer 2019, Liu founded \\"The Liu Huan's Foundation of Original Music\\" (ÂàòÊ¨¢ÂéüÂàõÈü≥‰πêÂü∫Èáë) in collaboration with Mango TV and Mango V, the show's sponsors, where every (approximately ) of the funding would be extracted every January 11 (the date of the show's premiere episode) of the year to sponsor one potential singer of China. Liu was also the series ambassador and promoting the Mango TV app to encourage viewers across the world to watch the series, as shown before each episode begin airing. On April 3, 2020, Liu was confirmed to have been diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis, also called osteonecrosis or bone infarction. =Foreign language skills= During Liu Huan‚Äô s lectures, he introduces some foreign words when naming people, schools, and locations. These words are sometimes English, and sometimes French, German, and even Italian. Liu Huan says modestly: ‚ÄúMy major is French, and I can speak English, too.

Brill, 1992,80 He was the son of Ma'mun I ibn Muhammad.The Monumental Inscriptions from Early Islamic Iran and Transoxiana, editor Sheila Blair, E.J. Brill, 1992,80 The greatest threat to Ma'mun's rule came in the form of the Ghaznavid sultan, Mahmud of Ghazni. Mahmud viewed Khwarazm as a strategically important province, as it would allow him to widen the front against his biggest enemy, the Karakhanids of Transoxiana. When the caliph al-Qadir sent Ma'mun several awards, including an investiture patent for Khwarazm (confirming him as independent ruler) in 1014, Ma'mun refused to accept the awards in his capital, fearing that personally accepting the symbols of independence would anger Mahmud. He instead sent out a delegation to accept the awards on the steppe. Ma'mun also married Mahmud's sister Hurra-yi Kalji, who had previously been married to his brother, in 1015 or 1016.The Early Ghaznavids, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol.4, ed. R. N. Frye, (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 174. Despite these efforts to placate Mahmud, the Ghaznavid demanded that Ma'mun put his name in the khutba, in effect acknowledging his suzerainty. Although the nobility and the army were opposed to such measure, Ma'mun had no choice but to give in. He agreed to place Mahmud's name in the khutba and to fulfil other humiliating demands. In response the army revolted and Ma'mun was killed. The rebels placed his nephew Muhammad on the throne, but Mahmud used the death of his brother-in-law as a pretext for annexing Khwarazm.The Early Ghaznavids, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol.4, 174. During Ma'mun's reign several scholars, such as al-Biruni, resided in Khwarazm, and in fact one of Mahmud's demands upon the shah was that several of them be sent to him. Ma'mun also was responsible for several building projects; he ordered a minaret to be constructed in Konya-Urgench in 1011.The Monumental Inscriptions from Early Islamic Iran and Transoxiana, editor Sheila Blair, E.J.

As of the 2010 census the neighborhood had a population of 1,780. The ZIP Codes serving the neighborhood are 33607 and 33614. Geography Drew Park boundaries are Hillsborough Avenue to the north, Tampa Bay Blvd. to the south, Tampa International Airport to the west, and Dale Mabry Highway to the east.Hillsborough Community Atlas The area is flat but above any flood zones. Drew Field in 1948 Description Drew Park was originally Drew Field, named for cattleman and land developer John H. Drew. It was Tampa's first municipal airport, a grass airfield that opened in 1928. At the onset of World War II, the federal government took over the field and developed a military base containing airstrips, barracks, field hospitals, and a German and Italian POW camp. The City of Tampa leased the field to the army for one dollar a year. Parts of the film Air Force were filmed here. The base theater is still standing today as the Playhouse Adult Theater. Dale Mabry Highway was built in 1943 to link Drew Field with MacDill Air Force Base to the south. Drew Park is now home to the main campus of the Hillsborough Community College, George M. Steinbrenner Field and (before it was demolished) the former W. T. Edwards Tuberculosis Hospital. Auto dealerships populate much of the Dale Mabry edge of Drew Park and shopping and restaurants make up the Hillsborough Ave edge. The core of Drew Park is occupied by light industry, adult entertainment establishments and several homes, due to its mixed-use zoning. Law enforcement has conducted many raids on the businesses in the area accusing them of prostitution, operating without licenses, and illegally selling alcohol. In 1988, Hillsborough County Aviation Authority announced long-term plans to acquire several hundred acres in Drew Park for the expansion of Tampa International. This will include the redevelopment of the Airport's air cargo facility, aircraft maintenance, fuel farms, equipment maintenance, Aircraft Rescue Fire Training facilities and other aviation-related facilities. To date, the authority has acquired 96% of the parcels in the land acquisition area. Durex Industrial On June 13, 1992, two nine-year-old boys, Scotty Perez and Anthony Storman, died after climbing into an open dumpster containing toxic chemicals. The dumpster was used by Durex Industrial, Inc. at 4815 N West Shore Blvd. to illegally dispose of toluene which was used in the manufacturing of printing rollers. Two employees, William C. Whitman and Duane C. Whitman, were sentenced to 27-month prison sentences for illegally handling, storing or disposing of toluene. Durex Industries was fined $1.5-million. A Hillsborough county jury awarded the families a $500-million verdict against the company. The corporation itself was broke and no money was paid to the families. In 1998, the owner William Recht Jr. agreed to pay each family $400,000 and a $200,000 fine after pleading guilty to storing hazardous wastes without a permit. He was sentenced to 30 months of probation. The incident caused many businesses in the area to install locks on their dumpsters. It later inspired the play The Toxic Wave by Susan Hussey, co- founder of the Drew Park-based Gorilla Theatre. Demographics Source: Hillsborough County Atlas As of the census of 2010, there were 1,780 people and 654 households residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 1,376/mi2. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 66% White, 15% African American, 2% Native American, 2% Asian, 11% from some other race and 4% from two or more races.

History The battalion was organized at Albany, December 5, 1861, and there mustered in the United States service for three years, December 6 and 7, 1861. The three companies recruited originally--Ransom's, Lee's and Sauer's--were consolidated into two companies on December 5 and the battalion, commanded by Maj. Thomas W. Lion, left the state on December 9. It served at and near Washington, D. C., from December 1861, and in North Carolina, (2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, Dept. of North Carolina), from May 1862 until February 11, 1863, when the battalion organization was discontinued. The two companies, A and B, were designated the 23rd and 24th batteries of Light Artillery, having served provisionally as such from November 1, 1862. The loss and engagements of the battalion are included in the record of the batteries into which its two companies were converted. Rocket artillery A British Whitworth rifled- breechloader, not unlike the breechloading guns used by the Rocket Battalion. During its months of service, the Rocket Battalion used eight breechloading cannon designed to fire Hale rockets. These were developed by Major Lions himself, and presented to President Lincoln shortly after the Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. They proved very unreliable during tests and in combat, so after the battalion was disbanded, each battery received regular M1857 12-pounder Napoleon's instead.

As such, he advised on Argentine foreign policy strategy vis-√†-vis the Western powers particularly in the wake of the Falklands War. Escud√© graduated in sociology from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina in 1973. In 1977 he matriculated in St. Antony‚Äôs College, Oxford, transferring to Yale University in 1978 upon receipt of a Fulbright Fellowship. In 1981 he earned his Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale; in 1984 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship; in 1986 he was decorated with the Order of Bernardo O‚ÄôHiggins for promoting peace and friendship between Argentina and Chile; in 1996 he received the Konex Award, and in 2003 he was appointed 2003-2004 Ashley Fellow by Trent University (Canada), nominated as ‚Äúlikely the most distinguished political theorist in Latin America‚Äù. His books have been edited in Argentina, the United States and Italy. His academic articles have also been published in the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Israel, Poland and Mexico. He has been visiting professor at Harvard University‚Äôs Department of Government and at Madrid‚Äôs Ortega y Gasset Institute, as well as visiting fellow at St. Antony‚Äôs College (Oxford), University of Augsburg (Germany), Johns Hopkins University (SAIS), UNC (Chapel Hill) and Texas (Austin). Escud√©'s academic work is associated with neomodernism and with peripheral realism. These approaches posit an interstate system with two complementary hierarchies that are only partially overlapping. Peripheral realism is a foreign policy theory that argues that the international system has an incipiently hierarchical structure based on differentiated roles: rule-makers, rule-takers and rogue states. It appraises the costs, for the citizens of weaker states without rule-making capabilities, of defying the order established by the stronger, rule-making actors of the interstate system. This global power hierarchy is complemented by a moral hierarchy that acknowledges that all cultures are not morally equivalent. Here is where neomodernism comes in. If all cultures were morally equivalent, then all human individuals would not be endowed with the same human rights, because some cultures award some men more rights than are allotted to other men and women. Hence, if all men and women are endowed with the same human rights, then all cultures cannot not be morally equivalent, because cultures that acknowledge that ‚Äòall men are created equal‚Äô are superior, in terms of their civil ethics, to those that do not. In the West, the neomodern era is characterized by this inevitable conflict between postmodern relativism and modernity‚Äôs assumptions about the essential equality of human individuals. Concomitantly, the neomodern world-system is characterized by the two hierarchies, one related to an ethics of human rights and the other to a logic of power. He converted to Conservative Judaism. In 2010 he spoke in favour of the Cristina Fern√°ndez administration's foreign policy. Publications =Recent papers= * \\"'Linguistic Peace'?

He was an irrigation engineer who proposed and built the first Aswan Dam, the scale of which had never been attempted previously.Frederic Courtland Penfield, Harnessing the Nile, Century Magazine, Vol. 57, No. 4 (February 1899) He later undertook other major irrigation projects in South Africa and in Arab regions of the dying Ottoman Empire. Biography Willcocks was one of four sons of a British Engineer posted in Roorkee for Ganges canal works. He graduated from the Thomason College of Civil Engineering, Roorkee in 1872, and joined the Indian Public Works Department the same year. Following the British invasion and occupation of Egypt, he began work with the long- established Egyptian Public Works Department in 1883. He was serving as director general of reservoirs for Egypt when he completed his studies and plans in 1896 to construct the Aswan Low Dam, the first true storage reservoir on the river. He supervised its construction from 1898 to its completion in 1902. He also designed and constructed another dam on the Nile, the Assiut Barrage, also completed in 1902. He later became chairman of the Cairo Water Works Company, and was also president of the Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotments Company which was instrumental for the urbanization of Zamalek district (then known as Gezireh) early in the 20th century. One of the streets of Zamalek was named 'Willcocks' after him. He left his position in Egypt by 1897 and four years later he was invited to South Africa. With the end of the Anglo-Boer War he was asked to look into the possibility of irrigation projects in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony. Part of his plans were implemented and for this he was granted the title of KCMG. He later became head of irrigation for the Ottoman Turkish government, for what was then the greater area of Turkish Arabia. He drew up the first accurate maps of the region, which were subsequently a great help to British expeditionary forces in 1914 and again in 1915. In 1911 he proposed to have the water brought to the ancient area of Chaldea in Southern Mesopotamia. The Hindiya Barrage was consequently built on the River Euphrates near ancient Babylon, bringing under irrigation.\\"Willcocks, Sir William.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2006. He worked on irrigation projects in Romania shortly before the outbreak of World War I, and again as late as 1928 in Bengal, where he had received some his early training. In January 1921 he was put on trial before the Supreme Consular Court of Egypt on a charge of sedition and criminal libel, on account of statements made by him impugning the trustworthiness of the data concerning the Nile irrigation published by Murdoch Macdonald, adviser of the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works. He was found guilty 11 March, and on 16 April he was bound over to be of good behaviour for one year. He died at the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo.

Anangabhima Deva III was a powerful Odia ruler and reformist of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty that ruled an early medieval Odisha centered empire in eastern India from the year 1211-1238 A.D. He was successful in maintaining a large extent of territory that stretched from the river Ganga in the north to Godavari in the South. He had successfully defeated the Kalachuris on the western frontiers of the empire and established a matrimonial alliance with them. His brother or brother in law, Rajaraja II became the ruler of the Dynasty in 1198. When Anangabhima III came into power, in 1211, he expelled the Muslims of Bengal from his kingdom. He had a son, Narasingha Deva I, who would later invade Bengal in 1244, and captured the capital city, Gauda. He was a reformist in the social and spiritual structure of the Odia society as the vaishnavite deity Jagannath was declared as the supreme ruler of the empire and the emperor as the deputy under him. The Madala Panji records he claiming himself as Shri Purushottama dedicating everything to lord Jagannath.  Foundation of Bidanasi Katak or Cuttack City  Ananga Bhima Deva III became the ruler of the ancient land of Kalinga in the year 1211 A.D. At the time of his coronation, his kingdom faced repeated attacks from the Muslim forces of Ghiyasuddin Iwaj Shah, the ruler of Bengal. The Kalachuri kings had been struggling to take over the territory of Odisha from the times of the Somavanshi rulers and the western frontier of Anangabhima's kingdom was repeatedly violated by them. Anangabhima chose the strategic location on the bifurcation of rivers Mahanadi and Katthajodi for the site of his new capital and moved his capital to Baranasi Katak. In 1230 A.D he moved his headquarters to the new capital. Katak literally means a fortification. The city was named as Bidanasi Katak (new Varanasi fort) and a new fort complex called Barabati was constructed to build up his military force under the guidance of his able Brahman minister and military adviser named as Vishnu.  Military Career and Achievements  Anangabhima Deva III was the most successful achiever of military objectives after a long line of limited rulers in the region. While regaining lost territories, he also managed to defend his kingdom from greater threats of the Bengal Muslim rulers by crossing over into their territory and also expanded his empire in southern India till Srirangam that is situated in the heart land of today's Tamil Nadu state. = Victory Over the Kalachuris at Seori Narayana = alt= Anangabhima Deva III was at the threshold of the continuous conflict with the eventually depleting Ratnapura Kalachuri dynasty which had defeated the Somavamshis and occupied the western tracts of ancient Kalinga kingdom at its height in the past or the complete Tri Kalinga region. The southern Haihaya kings of Tumana in modern Bilaspur district were also to a certain extent fighting against the Ganga forces. Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva , the ancestor of Anangabhimadeva III was unsuccessful in reclaiming these lost territories despite his numerous military achievements. The Kalachuri king, Pratapmalla continued his attempts to invade the frontiers of the Ganga territory along with his son Paramardi Dev. Anangabhima send a large force under the command of his able Brahman commander, Vishnu. The two forces met face to face at the Seori Narayana village in undivided Sambalpur district on the banks of the river called Bhima near the Vindhya hills and the Kalchuris were defeated for the first time in a major way by the Gangas. According to the Chateswara Temple Inscription of Anangabhima mentions that Vishnu terrorized the Kalachuri king to an extent when he lost his psychological balance. > Vindhyadreradhisima-Bhimatatini-kunje....Vishnu-Vishnu-. > Rasavasaviti-Bhayadvai-Tandisah-Pasyatah....Visvam- > Visnumayam Yatha Parinatam Tummana Prithivipateh Which means: Vishnu, the Brahamin minister and general of Anangabhima Deva III frightened the king of Tummana on the bank of the Bhima river near Vindhyas so much so that the latter perceived Vishnu every where through out his kingdom. Pratapmalla was taken prisoner and forced to cede the Sambalpur-Sonepur- Bolangir tracts along with parts of what is now Chhattishgarh state to the Ganga kingdom. Later with the advise of his minister Vishnu, Anangabhima established a diplomatic and matrimonial alliance with the Kalachuris by offering the hand of his daughter Chandrika in marriage to the Kalachuri prince, Parmardi Dev. Once the alliance was secured, the Ganga forces multiplied in strength. This diplomatic decision was made keeping in eye the long term prospects of a major threat from the Muslim rulers of Bengal.  Chandrika, the Ganga Princess  Chandrika, the daughter of Anangabhima III was an expert in music and dance. She was a devout Vaishnavite and later built the Ananta Vasudeva temple at Bhubaneswar with the permission of his brother Narasingha Deva I after he inherited the throne. She was married to the Haihaya prince Parmardi Deva by the wishes of her father for the foundation of a military alliance through a marital relation between the Eastern Gangas and the Kalachuri-Haihaya princedoms of Tumana. She lost her gallant Haihaya husband in the final recorded battle of Narasingha Deva I's invasion of Bengal at Umurdan (Amarda in Mayurbhanj district). Paramardi Deva had led the Eastern Ganga forces with possibly the other conscript soldiers from the independent and Semi independent Hindu kingdoms in Eastern India against the Muslim rulers of Bengal under the command of his Eastern Ganga brother in law. = War with the Invading Khilji Malik of Bengal (1223-1225 A.D.) = Sanskrit Inscription of Anangabhima Deva III at Chateswara Temple built during his rule After defeating the Kalchuris, Anangabhima faced a major threat from the invading Muslim forces of Khilji Maliks from Bengal. His prime enemy Ghiyasuddin Iwaj Shah, the ruler of Bengal was a successor of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji who was a successful military general of Qutb Ud Din Aibak. Ghiyassuddin had built a powerful navy and set out for conquest of neighboring kingdoms like Kamarupa and Odisha. He invaded the northern territories and also sent naval armadas over the river Mahanadi to capture his newly founded capital, destabilize his military strength and occupy lands. During the series of these events the newly built Barabati Fort was successfully used to repulse the enemy attacks from the river. His able minister and military adviser, Vishnu commanded a force that chased the invading Muslims on the land out of northern Odisha. The inscriptions of Chateswar temple (Salepur in Cuttack district) and Ananta Vasudeva temple confirm that the Muslim forces of Bengal were defeated by the able commander Vishnu who was able to pull his bow string until his ears and shot arrows killing many enemy soldiers. Odia forces are noted to have crossed over into Bengal, giving chase to the fleeing Yavanas during the conflict as mentioned in the inscriptions. Chateswara Temple Inscription Statements Indicating the Role of Vishnu in the Battle Against the Yavanas (Muslims) : > Karnottam- Sita-Savakasya-Subhata-Nekakina Nighnatah > Kimbruna-Yavanavanindra-Samare Tattasaya-Varabratam Anantavasudeva Temple Inscription Statements: > Yadvamse-Vaijayanti-Patamiva-Subhato-Anangabhimah Pravavah > -Pradhvastaratiraja Vraja -Yuvati-Yanodgita Gambhirasarah > Asidasivisire-Radhikataratarasta Drugarvorugarobah-Svante > Svantapasarpata Yavamapi Yavanam Sangare Sanjahara. Which Means: In Chodaganga Deva's lineage was like a flag the heroic Anangabhima, whose profound strength was celebrated by the damsels of a multitude of hostile kings destroyed by his power, and who was exceedingly proud of his swift horses, the speed of which surpassed that of snakes' foes Garuda. He made an end of the war by defeating the Yavanas with impetuosity after entering into their territory beyond the frontier. = Conflicts in Southern India and Conquests till Kanchi and Srirangam (1230 A.D.) = In the first stage of this campaign on his southern rival Ganapatideva, Anangabhima advanced until the Krishna river and camped there. The territories were included in the Odisha in the year 1230 A.D. However, in the second stage the Kakatiya king by the name Narasimha II defeated his forces and the territories until East Godavari were lost to the Kakatiyas. Taking advantage of the Kakatiya king Ganapati Deva's invasion on the Chola territory and according to Allalanatha temple inscription, Anangabhima III overran the Kanchipuram and Srirangam towns in south India. His queen Somaladevi Mahadevi is recorded to have made a valuable gift to the temple of Allalanatha. Anangabima became the first Eastern Ganga ruler to place his inscription in the Simhanchalam temple. Historian T.V. Mahalingam states that Anangabhima Deva III took the advantage of political situation in the Chola kingdom during the rule of Rajaraja III and occupied Kanchipuram. Anangabhimadeva might have been invited by the rebellious vassal of the Chola ruler Kopperunjinga who had imprisoned Rajaraja III at Sandamangalam in the south Arcot district. Vira Narasimha II of the Hoysala dynasty who reinstated Rajaraja III back on the throne has also inscribed that he uprooted a contingent of Kalingan forces from the city of Kanchipuram.This eventful conflicts in the southern regions let the Odishan forces extend their hegemony till the Krishna river in the south. According to the Sri Ranganathaswamy temple inscriptions at Srirangam, the Pandyan king Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I liberated the temple situated today in the heartland of Tamil Nadu state from the occupying Odia soldiers in 1225 A.D. This indicates that the empire of Anangabhima Deva III had briefly expanded till extreme southern ends of the Indian subcontinent from Bengal in the east.  Personality, Constructive Activities and Cultural Contribution  Megheswara temple in Bhubaneswar built during the rule of Anangabhima Deva III Chateswara Temple built during the rule of Anangabhima Deva III Srikumam and Draksarama inscriptions mention that Anangabhima was a devout Vaishnavite and extremely spiritual person. The Allalnath Perumal inscription at Kanchipuram of his wife Somaladevi says he used to follow the fasting ritual of Ekadasibrata of Vaishnavism and was the son of Purrushottama (a name of Vishnu). He assumed the title of Anangabhima-Rauta-Deva (Rauta meaning deputy) and declared himself as the sole deputy of Lord Purushottama or Lord Jagannath. He also assumed the titles of Parama Vaishnava and Parama Mahesvara to legalize his higher spiritual position in the state. It was during his rule that Lord Jagannath of Puri was officially accepted as the national deity. In the year 1238 A.D. he declared his regnal year or Anka as the regnal year of Lord Purushottama. Anangabhima Deva III's Jagannath Temple at Jajpur that was rebuilt in 18th Century by the Maratha Hindu ruler Raghuji Bhonsle I and after it was attacked by Bengal Nawab Suleiman Karani in the year 1568. He is speculated to have build a new Jagannath temple at Cuttack, his newly founded capital city along with two Shiva temples like Meghesvara at Bhubaneswar. Anangbhima Deva III is also credited for the construction of the Chateswara Shiva temple situated near Salepur in Cuttack district along with the Jagannath temple at Jajpur town that was destroyed by the invading forces of Suleiman Karani in the sixteenth century and was later rebuild by Maratha ruler Raghuji Bhonsle I of Nagpur in the eighteenth century. He had also erected the original Baladevjew temple at Tulasi Khetra in Kendrapada and it was later demolished by the Mughal subedar of Aurangzeb named as Khan-I- Dwina in 1663 to erect a Mosque. The original deities were taken into hiding by the priests and later restored to a new location and in a new temple erected after a century by local Zamindars and rulers with the permission of the Maratha ruler Janoji. The later temple is still existing while the Mosque stands on the original site. During his rule the leaning temple of Huma at Sambalpur was also built which was later renovated or reconstructed by Chauhan kings in seventeenth century. Anangabhima Deva financed and monitored constructions along with serious maintenance activities of the old structures within the Jagannath temple complex at Puri. Some four inscriptions recording details about daily food offerings and land donations to lord Jagannath has been found in the entrance walls of Pataleswara temple inside the complex. Anangabhima Deva declared himself as Purushottamaputra, Rudraputra and Durgaputra in his Draksarama inscription. This indicates the state policy of all the three Brhaminical cults came together under a harmonious unified spiritual structure during his rule. He donated to multiple Shaiva shrines across his empire. He completed the construction of Puri Jagannath temple. He introduced the Chattishaniyoga or 36 types of services to the lord Jagannath. Some four recorded inscriptions of the Ganga king has been found inside the Jagannath temple of Puri and in which mentions about huge land grants to the temple and lord Jagannath. He had also introduced the ‚ÄòPanda‚Äô or priest care system at the Puri shrine.The Draksarama Nagari plate inscription also credits him for making many land grants to the Brahmins. His Chatesvara temple inscription states that he undertook numerous public welfare projects for construction of roads, tanks, houses and temples for the people. As per the Madalapanji temple records of Puri Jagannath, the king undertook a land settlement by the assistance of his two revenue ministers Damodar Badapanda and Isana Pattanayak. The total revenue collected during his rule was four crores and forty-three lakhs of tankas. He also ordered repairing of old temples and places of historical significance.

As an activist she opposed the federal termination of tribes from the 1950s following the bills led by Arthur Vivian Watkins, a Republican senator. Background A member of the Menominee tribe, Deer was born in Keshena, Wisconsin in 1935 and grew up living on an Indian reservation. She obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and a Master of Social Work from the New York School of Social Work (later Columbia University School of Social Work). Native American advocacy Following completion of her graduate work, Deer returned to the Midwest to be closer to the Menominee Nation, settling in Minneapolis. She found few local services in place for Native Americans living in urban settings. She worked to advocate on their behalf with federal authorities. She also led a newer generation of Native American Leaders which helped gain acceptance of self-determination in things that they do, but also works to implement it consistently. Ada Led the Menominees in their drive to restore the ties that their tribe had with the federal government in 1991. Ada Deer does this because in 1991 she became the head of the Native American Right's Fund. This is a large accomplishment, which led to immense leadership capabilities. In the book, American Indians by Hagan, Ada Deer is described as a part of the \\"increasing number of women\\" that are making a difference in the Native American environment. Since the \\"Termination Era\\" of the 1950s and 1960s (resulting in reduced federal oversight of Native American affairs), the Menominee tribe had been governed by a corporate body called Menominee Enterprise, Inc.. Menominee Enterprises, Inc. was controlled by a voting trust and Menominee tribal members had no shares in the corporation. Four of the voting trust members were Menominee; however, five votes were required in order for the trust to take action. In the 1960s and 1970s there was renewed Congressional involvement in rebuilding tribal infrastructure, both socially and economically. During that time, Deer became involved in a group called DRUMS (Determination of Right and Unity for Menominee Shareholders) in opposition to Menominee Enterprise's proposed sale of former Menominee lands. At first, Deer encountered difficulty with Wayne Aspinall, chairman of the Interior Committee in Congress, who had supported termination of the Menominee as a federally recognized tribe. . She took frequent trips to Washington, but was denied the chance to speak with Aspinall. After he was defeated for his seat, Deer raised publicity as well as support for the Menominee cause. Her efforts, along with many other Menominees, played a part in bringing the Termination Era to a close. On December 22, 1973 President Richard Nixon signed the Menominee Restoration Act. This legislation restored official federal recognition to the Menominee tribe. From 1974 to 1976, Deer served as chair of the Menominee Restoration Committee. In 1993, Deer was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Interior by President Bill Clinton and served head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1993 to 1997 and as the first woman to head this Bureau. During this period, she was a delegate to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. From January to May 1997, she served as Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission.NIGC.gov , Past Commissioners, Commission Chairs Before and after her term in the BIA, Deer served on the National Support Committee of the Native American Rights Fund. She has served as chair of the NSC and chair of the NARF board of directors. Political efforts Deer ran for Wisconsin's secretary of state in both 1978 and 1982 but was not successful. She served as vice-chair of the Walter Mondale/Geraldine Ferraro presidential campaign in 1984. In 1992, she ran for a seat in the United States Congress in Wisconsin's Second District. She won the Democratic primary without \\"soft money\\" funding from political action committees. Following her primary win, a local newspaper ran a photo of Deer proudly holding a sign reading \\"Me Nominee\\" in a reference to her tribal membership. Educational career Deer has taught in the School of Social Work at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison since 1977, currently holding the title of Distinguished Lecturer. Since 1999, she has been the director of the American Indian Studies Department at UW‚ÄìMadison. During her tenure, she co-founded Milwaukee's Indian Community School. She also created the first program at the University to provide social work training on Native American reservations. In addition, she is a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government.

It opened in 1964 and thrived for a time by using then-cutting-edge innovations like top-to-bottom snowmaking and lighted night skiing. Founder Jim Kelly gave the resort an Irish theme: its nickname was \\"Kelly's Irish Alps\\"; the slopes had names like \\"Shamrock,\\" \\"Killarney,\\" and \\"JFK\\"; and the base lodge housed an Irish-themed bar that did a rousing business in drinks and live music. But like many small independent ski areas, Brodie lost business over time to larger, higher- capitalized, corporate-owned resorts. In 1999 the Kellys sold it to the owners of nearby Jiminy Peak, who closed Brodie in 2002 and sold it to a Texas-based condominium developer. The area continued to operate snow tubing, in conjunction with Jiminy Peak, through the 2006‚Äì07 season. With a vertical drop of 1,250 feet and four chairlifts, Brodie is the largest closed ski area in the Berkshires. Wind power Part of the mountain is now the site of a Wind power project: the Berkshire Wind Power Project is owned by the Berkshire Wind Power Cooperative Corporation, a non-profit, public power corporation.

K. Rowling and the 2007 film of the same name, for Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X,\\"EA : Harry Potter : Order of the Phoenix\\" - - Retrieved on 7/4/07 Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2,\\"EA : Harry Potter : Order of the Phoenix\\" - - Retrieved on 7/4/2007 PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and Xbox 360. It was released on June 25, 2007 in North America, June 28, 2007 in Australia and June 29, 2007 in Europe. The theme of the game is to explore Hogwarts and follow the story from the book and movie. EA encouraged fan participation in the development of this game, and worked with a fan council. The game returns to the sandbox style of the first three games rather than the action-oriented Goblet of Fire. Similar to any sandbox, Hogwarts is fully explorable most of the time, and there are \\"discovery points\\" that provide rewards to the player, which can be activated by completing side missions. Furthermore, there are battles between groups of students, as shown in the game trailer. Gameplay The game presents the player with a large part of the Harry Potter universe, combining the movie blueprints, J.K. Rowling's drawings and books' descriptions to recreate known places, including the Ministry of Magic, Grimmauld Place and Little Whinging. As well as the main missions, and as part of the new sandbox style of playing, players can explore Hogwarts and interact with objects, using magical spells to earn Discovery points. One can duel Slytherins in the Entrance Courtyard, Paved Courtyard, and specific floor corridors. One can also duel throughout the story. Most of them are played as Harry. Nevertheless, near the end, one will play as Sirius Black and Dumbledore in different duels. Earning Discovery points increases the power of the owned spells, and earns player bonuses, such as behind-the- scenes videos and trophies, which can be viewed in the Room of Rewards. Items in the room such as trophies can also be unlocked by taking part in the various mini games, such as Exploding Snap, Wizard chess and Gobstones. There are various missions to complete which follow the storyline of the film, such as the recruiting of Dumbledore's Army members, or creating havoc when Umbridge is made Headmistress. Spells =Environmental Spells= ‚ñ™ Accio: Summons objects towards the caster. ‚ñ™ Depulso: Pushes objects away from the caster. ‚ñ™ Wingardium Leviosa: Lifts objects in the air. ‚ñ™ Incendio: Sets objects on fire. ‚ñ™ Reparo: Mends broken objects. ‚ñ™ Reducto: Breaks objects. =Defensive Spells= ‚ñ™ Stupefy: Stuns enemies. ‚ñ™ Expelliarmus: Disarms an enemies wand. ‚ñ™ Protego: Shields and deflects enemy spells. ‚ñ™ Rictusempra: Stuns enemies. ‚ñ™ Levicorpus: Lifts enemies by their ankles. ‚ñ™ Pertrificus Totalus: Freezes enemies. ‚ñ™ Expecto Patronum: Used in combat against Dementors. Only used at certain points of the game.  Development  The game's sandbox style provides the player with an open environment, as the player is able to move around parts of Hogwarts freely. Hogwarts in this game was modeled after the movie sets rather than a recreation of the developer's own design. They recreated every single iconic background from all movies and added their own unfeatured rooms. In an interview with MTV, lead designer Chris Roberts described the game as having heavy input by Rowling. The game features Wizard games, such as \\"Gobstones\\" and \\"exploding snap\\", which were created by the developers, and later confirmed by J.K. Rowling as the official rules for those games. He also stated that she had input over some of the game's content, saying: During development, certain characters from the film series visited the studio to have their faces rendered into the game; where the cast members included Rupert Grint and Evanna Lynch. Soundtrack The game's soundtrack was composed by James Hannigan and conducted by Allan Wilson. Hannigan wrote themes for the various characters and incorporated \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" by John Williams into the score. IGN has given the game's music a rating of 9.5 out of 10. A small number of tracks present in the Order of the Phoenix video game were also featured in The Philosopher's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets and The Prisoner of Azkaban video games, composed by Jeremy Soule. The Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix game soundtrack featuring James Hannigan's music was released on the E.A.R.S. label in 2007, with references to John Williams' Hedwig's Theme removed, to much critical acclaim from fans of film and game soundtracks. For reasons unknown, the soundtrack, along with Hannigan's later Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince soundtrack and the earlier game scores by Jeremy Soule, was withdrawn from sale in 2009. It has been speculated that market confusion involving multiple soundtracks with the same title may have led to the withdrawal, but others have speculated that reviews by various soundtrack critics describing Hannigan's work as superior to the score of the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix film may have contributed to the decision. Hannigan's soundtracks for the last two games in the series were never officially released. In 2020, the soundtrack album was re-released under the title of EA Music Composer Series: James Hannigan, Vol. 2, and many of the references to the Harry Potter series are censored in the track titles. Reception The game itself received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The game's best scores came from the seventh generation of video game consoles, with the Wii version scoring the highest overall at 69%. Reviewers were particularly pleased with how the Wiimote controlled the game, but claimed the game's design was poor. Greg Damiano of Game Revolution was very critical of the game, saying \\"One-on-one duels are dreadfully easy, and the occasional free-for-alls are an unplayable chaos\\" Damiano was also critical of how the plot of the novel is played out in the game, \\"plot points are introduced and quickly forgotten in an impressively senseless flurry.\\" The game's music was one of the few positive points for the game, with Damiano saying \\"At least the musical score rocks out with a full orchestra, with songs from the film and a very appealing flow of music overall. Twenty-two actors from the film lend their voices to the game, though some of the performances (unfortunately including Harry‚Äôs) sound flat and phoned-in\\" Hypers Daniel Wilks however, commended the Wii game for its \\"great looks, the Wii-wand and in-game exploration\\". However, he criticised it for its \\"repetitive quests and poor waypoints\\". Phil Theobald of GameSpy was also positive about the game's design, and the Wii version, saying \\"The Wii controls are quite a bit of fun\\" and concluded that whilst \\"the 360 and PS3 versions looks quite a bit better\\" the \\"Wii version certainly doesn't look bad.\\" Charles Herold of The New York Times gave it a mixed review and stated that the game \\"has an unfinished feel, as though the game‚Äôs designers stuck in a placeholder for game play, planning to flesh it out later, only to run out of time.\\" Notes and References =Notes= =References= External links  * Category:2007 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Game Boy Advance games Harry Potter 5 Category:Video games based on adaptations Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games developed in Romania Category:Video games scored by James Hannigan Category:Video games set in England Category:Video games set in London Category:Video games set in Scotland Category:Video games set in the 1990s Category:Video games set in 1995 Category:Video games set in 1996 Category:Warner Bros.

The University of Panama was founded under the administration of the President of the Republic, Dr. Harmodio Arias Madrid. Its founder and first President was the distinguished citizen Dr. Octavio M√©ndez Pereira. The University of Panama is a state institution of superior, independent education, inspired by the highest civic, moral, and ethical values. History The University of Panama was created by presidential decree on May 29, 1935. However, it began operations on October 7 of the same year in one of the wings of the Instituto Nacional (National Institute). Later on, under the administration of Enrique A. Jim√©nez, the government purchased around 60 hectares of land in the neighborhood of El Cangrejo, destined to be the future University's main campus. Construction work began in January 1948, under the supervision of Engineer Alberto De Saint Malo, who was the Dean of the Engineering and Architecture Faculty at the time. The first four buildings to be constructed were those that would be home to the Humanities, Engineering and Architecture faculties and Science laboratories, and the Administration and Library. Classes in the new buildings began on May 29, 1950. However, the campus was officially inaugurated on November 1, 1953, the same year of the Republic of Panama's 50th Anniversary of Independence. In the 1950s, construction work continued and 11 additional buildings were raised, some of which would hold the Biochemistry Center, and the Faculties of Pharmacy, and Public Administration and Commerce. In the following decade, 15 more buildings were constructed, among of which figure the Odontology and Law Faculties, and the Experimental Center for Agricultural Research in Tocumen. Between 1970 and 1980, the buildings that were destined for Biology, Architecture, Engineering, Humanities (other), and those destined for the Sim√≥n Bolivar Library and for the Laboratory of Specialized Analysis, among others, were finished. At the end of 1979, the University of Panama received the facilities of the Rainbow City High School in Col√≥n, where the first of the University's Regional Centers would begin operations. In the following decade, the Regional Centers for the provinces of Veraguas, Chiriqu√≠ and Cocl√©, and for the region of Azuero were built, including an Agricultural Sciences Faculty in Chiriqu√≠. In the 1990s, the Regional Center for Panam√° Oeste (Western Panama) and four buildings destined for research were constructed. At the end of the decade, in 1999 to be more specific, the ARI (Interoceanic Regional Authority), the Panamanian government agency once responsible for the management of the land of the former Panama Canal Zone, transferred the buildings of the former Curundu Junior High School to the University of Panama. This complex would later become the Harmodio Arias Madrid Campus. Other facilities transferred were the ones later used for the Veterinary Hospital, in Corozal. Also during this time, the University expanded its number of buildings by adding 19 more, thanks to the acquisition of adjacent buildings and to the construction of the Regional Center in Bocas del Toro, the extensions of Chepo and Dari√©n, and the Popular Universities of Azuero and Cocl√©, today known as Universidades del Trabajo y La Tercera Edad (Universities of Labor and Elders). Achievements Several international research agreements and personnel exchanges have been made by government agencies with the institution. Professors in areas of science and technology, medical health, economics and law have been invited to give keynotes and also teach in other campuses around the world. The University of Panama has also sent representatives to several international congresses and meetings such as Women and Gender, World Economic Forum, environmental congresses, biological research meetings, statistics congresses and many other disciplines.

In the , Cannon Hill had a population of 5533 people.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . Geography The suburb is located east of the CBD and borders Carina, Morningside, Murarrie, and Tingalpa. History Cannon Hill was originally inhabited by Murris, but they were \\"dispersed\\" by the Native Police and Brisbane Mounted Police in November 1861, around the time when European settlement began in the area. Some land was used by settlers for farming and grazing, but the area remained mostly bushland. The suburb is most likely named after Cannon Hill House, a residence formerly located on Wynnum Road. It was occupied by the Weedon family from its construction in 1867 until burning down in 1927. Thornhill Weedon named the house after two fallen trees which were said to have resembled a cannon. The Cleveland railway line was opened in 1889 going through Cannon Hill to Cleveland. At the same time blocks of land near the station were offered for sale. Cannon Hill State School opened on 16 August 1915. In 1931, Brisbane's sale yards for livestock were relocated from Newmarket to Cannon Hill adjacent to the abattoir. The sale yards at Cannon Hill were described as \\"a paradise as compared to the old yards at Newmarket\\" and \\"possibly the best in the Southern Hemisphere\\". Specifically the yards had been specially constructed to prevent the bruising of cattle and the meat could be produced more hygienically for both local consumption and export. Blessed Oliver Plunkett School opened in January 1947 with an initial enrolment of 90 students. It was operated by the Presentation Sisters, a Roman Catholic order of nuns. When Oliver Plunkett was canonised on 12 October 1975 by Pope Paul VI, the school was renamed Saint Oliver Plunkett School. In December 1986 the involvement of the Presentation Sisters in the school ceased and a lay principal was appointed. St Boniface's Anglican Church Room was opened circa 1952. It closed circa 1964. In 1994, a Cannon Hill paddock became one of the first places where Hendra virus was transmitted between bats and horses. The infected mare was taken to a training complex, starting an outbreak that eventually killed horse trainer Vic Rail. The paddock has since been turned into housing and parkland in Murarrie.

Gilbert for his friend Rutland Barrington, who was then leasing the St. James's Theatre. The play opened on 29 November 1888 and closed on 29 December, after about 27 performances.Moss, Simon. \\"Brantinghame Hall\\" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 21 November 2009 It starred Barrington, his younger brother, Duncan Fleet, Lewis Waller, and Julia Neilson (being the professional stage debut of the latter two).Barrington, p. 78 Its companion piece was A Patron Saint.Information about cast and companion piece of Brantinghame Hall Brantinghame Hall was the worst financial failure of Gilbert's career and sent Barrington into bankruptcy. Gilbert vowed never to write another serious drama again, although eventually he did. Historian Jane Stedman speculates that the failure of this play (produced soon after The Yeomen of the Guard, which increased Arthur Sullivan's desire to turn to more serious operas), and Gilbert's subsequent aversion at this time to writing serious drama, may have hurt Gilbert's partnership with Sullivan, since Gilbert declined to write any more serious librettos for Sullivan.Stedman, pp. 252‚Äì58. However, this conclusion is dubious, since Gilbert and Sullivan soon collaborated on the comic and lively (and very successful) The Gondoliers (1889). Moreover, though Gilbert declined to write the libretto to Sullivan's grand opera, Ivanhoe (1891), it was he who recommended Julian Sturgis, who wrote the libretto for Sullivan. Many of the characters in the play are reminiscent of those in Gilbert's Savoy Operas, including Somers/Boatswain; Ross/Dr. Daly; Ruth/Patience and Elsie; Alaric/Giuseppe; Mabel/Aline; and Thursby/Ludwig. Also, as in some of his earlier plays, including Charity, Gilbert touches on the theme of how a shamed woman is truly the noblest in society. The character Ruth notes, regarding the scoundrel, Crampton, \\"your heart was slow to turn; your eyes were closed. To open them it needed that a woman should clothe herself with shame. That has been done; and now, you see!\\" And she is told by Mr. Thursby, \\"the sooner a ship-load of you is shot into London society the better!\\" (Act IV) Roles and cast *Lord Saxmundham, of Brantinghame Hall ‚Äì Nutcombe Gould *Hon.

Ruth (the daughter of an ex-convict) had nursed Arthur to health from near death when he first arrived in the village, and the two fell in love. The stockmen like Ruth and want to make sure that Arthur treats her well. Arthur tells them and then Ruth that he doesn't plan to give the news of his marriage to his father until he and Ruth travel to England to tell the old Lord in person. Meanwhile, the Rev Noel Ross, who performed Ruth and Arthur's wedding ceremony, reveals that he has come to Brunt's Station to avoid the temptations of the city, for his flesh is susceptible. Crampton (a creditor of Lord Saxmundham's) and Paulby arrive. Crampton declares his love for Ruth (having brought the dying Arthur to her), and Arthur aims a savage diatribe at Crampton, finally pointing out that Ruth is Arthur's wife. Crampton curses Arthur for this ill-treatment, stating that he has made a lifelong enemy. Meanwhile, Paulby has brought news that Arthur's godfather, Sir James Crawshay, has died in England and has left Arthur a fortune of three hundred thousand pounds ‚Äì enough to make them rich and to extract his father from his debts. Arthur is a trustee under the will and must return to England at once to sort out affairs. But Ruth feels that she cannot leave her sick old father, and Arthur agrees to go alone, with Ruth to follow at her first opportunity. Arthur leaves Noel Ross with his own will, made in Ruth's favour, and leaves in haste. ;Act II Eighteen months later, we learn that a bottle washed ashore near Point de Galle, Sri Lanka, containing a slip of paper indicating that Arthur's ship had sunk. Lord Saxmundham, as heir-at-law to his son, is therefore entitled to the estate demised to Arthur by his godfather. In Brantinghame Hall, Lord S., still in desperate financial straits, waits to hear whether a judge has ordered the estate to be turned over to him. Alaric Redmayne (in his last year at Eton) and Mabel tell Lady Saxmundham that they wish to marry, but Lady S. says that they are too young and asks them to postpone any discussion of marriage for \\"a long time.\\" Alaric makes a comically poor attempt to explain to Mabel why Radicals (him) are much better than Tories (Mr. Thursby), and Mabel finds his tortured logic very statesmanlike. Thursby brings the good news that the estate has been settled. Crampton arrives, threatening to foreclose on Brantinghame Hall, but Lord S. states that his debt shall be paid within the week. The grieving Ruth (her ex- convict father has died) shows up and points out that she is Arthur's widow and she has come to meet her beloved husband's family and to offer them her love. Lord S. blurts out that he is \\"amazed and distressed.\\" When he sees the marriage certificate and will, Lord S. notes that the fortune now belongs to Ruth. Ruth offers it to Lord S., but he declines sadly, saying \\"You speak kindly and generously; but you do not understand these matters.\\" He sends her to his solicitor and asks to be alone as he bursts into tears. ;Act III Two weeks later, in Brantingame Hall, Mr. Parfit readies the deed to surrender the Hall to Crampton. He urges Lord Saxmundham to borrow money from his friends to try to hang on to the Hall, in which nine generations of Saxmundhams have lived and died. Lord S. sadly declines, saying that this would only be postponing the inevitable. Lord S. points out to Alaric that they are now penniless, and that the lad must not marry Mabel, to avoid any accusation that he is a \\"fortune hunter.\\" Instead, he must go to India to \\"make his own way.\\" He breaks the news to Mabel and they part. Crampton tells Parfit, as they arrive at the Hall, that he is disposed to suspend the foreclosure, and Parfit goes to fetch the old Lord. Ruth enters and tries to avoid Crampton. He again declares that he loves her and tries to explain that his ex-wife had left him wrongfully. Ruth rejects him, and Crampton says angrily that in retaliation, he will go ahead to ruin Lord S. Ruth eloquently explains that this would be a cowardly act and suggests that perhaps Crampton is not a coward, and she leaves. Parfit returns with Lord S., and Crampton says that he wishes to go ahead with the foreclosure. Ruth returns with Thursby, and they implore Lord S. to permit Ruth to help him. He declines again, and Ralph suggests that he will stay the execution of the foreclosure if Ruth will \\"give me the love for which I have so long waited.\\" Ruth then declares, to everyone's astonishment, that she has lied: she was not Arthur's wife after all. She rushes from the room, and Crampton is left in distress. ;Act IV Later that day, in Thursby's morning room, Ruth and Thursby acknowledge that she must leave at once. Ruth tells Mabel that Alaric is wealthy again, and so she may get back together with him. Ruth also tells Mabel that she must go, and that if Mabel hears ill of her, \\"to believe that there is something kept back ‚Äì something which, if it were known, would clear me of all blame.\\" Ruth leaves. Crampton arrives and, moved by Ruth's selfless act, confesses to Thursby and Parfit that he knows Ruth was truly married to Arthur. Ruth returns, confirms this, and tells Crampton that she forgives him. Everyone leaves Ruth alone, when the missionary, Noel Ross arrives unexpectedly. He tells Ruth of his difficult voyage from Australia and notes that one must not give up hope when there is even the tiniest hope left, even if one were shipwrecked and \\"counted as dead....\\" Ruth is upset at his imagery, but then she grows suspicious. Arthur bursts into the room very much alive. Ruth kneels, saying, \\"Let us pray.\\"* Criticism In general, the critics felt that the play reflected Gilbert's 1860s style more than his more mature playwriting.Stedman, p. 253 The closing line, \\"Let us pray\\", added by Gilbert late in the play's construction, was widely believed to ruin the final scene and cause hilarity where drama was needed. Gilbert soon cut the line, but it was too late, and the play folded. Clement Scott's harsh review (especially of Neilson) led to the termination of Gilbert's relationship with Scott and threats of legal action.Stedman, pp. 254‚Äì55 According to Barrington's 1908 memoir, the critics also felt that no woman would go to the lengths that the heroine does in the play to save her husband's father.Barrington, p. 79; see also Stedman, p. 254 Notes References * * Glynn, Gerald, \\"Brantinghame Hall: 1.

He was the founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission (USCWM), William Carey International University, and the International Society for Frontier Missiology. His 1974 presentation at the Congress for World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland ‚Äì an event organized by American evangelist Billy Graham ‚Äì was a watershed moment for global mission. It was during this presentation that Winter shifted global mission strategy from a focus on political boundaries to a focus on distinct people groups. Winter argued that instead of targeting countries, mission agencies needed to target the thousands of people groups worldwide, over half of which have not been reached with the gospel message. Billy Graham once wrote: ‚ÄúRalph Winter has not only helped promote evangelism among many mission boards around the world, but by his research, training and publishing he has accelerated world evangelization.\\" In 2005, Winter was named by Time magazine as one of the 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America. Dr. Ray Tallman, shortly after Winter's death, described him as \\"perhaps the most influential person in missions of the last 50 years and has influenced missions globally more than anyone I can think of.\\" Early adulthood and works Winter grew up in the Los Angeles area. His father, Hugo, was a self-trained engineer who ended up leading a division of the L.A. planning department with 1,200 engineers under his leadership and was instrumental in the development of the greater L.A. Freeway system. When World War II broke out, Ralph was too young to enlist, so he studied for just two and a half years at Caltech and earned his B.S. degree, in order to join the U.S. Navy's pilot training program. Before he finished that training, the war ended and he was discharged, but his service in the Navy helped pay for his further education. He then went on to earn his MA at Columbia University, and PhD at Cornell University, and then a B.Div. at Princeton Theological Seminary. With childhood friend Dan Fuller (son of revival preacher Charles E. Fuller), he also studied at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., the first semester the school was open in 1946. He would later teach there.Parsons, Greg H. Ralph D. Winter: Early Life and Core Missiology, WCIU Press, 2012 At Princeton Seminary, Winter met future Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC) founder Bill Bright. The two Christian leaders maintained a close friendship throughout their lives until Bright's death in 2003.Winter, Ralph D. Frontiers in Mission William Carey International University Press, 2005. In 1951, Winter married his first wife, Roberta Helm, with whom he would later establish the USCWM in Pasadena. The couple, along with their four young daughters, served as Presbyterian missionaries to Guatemala from 1956 to 1966. It was in Guatemala where Winter developed and spearheaded the first Theological Education by Extension (TEE) program - the precursor for modern day theological distance education programs and the multi-campus models used by schools and seminaries today. Ralph Winter (far left) in Guatemala The idea behind TEE was to make it easier for local church leaders to learn and be ordained as ministers without relocating them and their families for years to the capital city to attend seminary. These students could continue their ministry while studying at extension campuses near their town or village. Then, once a month, they would go to the seminary in the capital city to study. The Theological Education by Extension idea inspired a movement and soon similar programs were replicated around the world. Although many credit him for the TEE idea, Winter points to missionary James Emery, who had served in Guatemala before him, for conceiving the idea upon which he built. Donald McGavran at Fuller Theological Seminary's School of World Mission was so impressed by the TEE education system that he asked Winter to join the faculty with him and Alan Tippett, a noted anthropologist. Winter was a professor at Fuller from 1966 to 1976. During this time, Winter taught more than a thousand missionaries who he said helped him learn about the global mission fields. It was also in these years that he founded the William Carey Library, which publishes and distributes mission materials; co- founded the American Society of Missiology; launched what is now the Perspectives Study Program (first called the Summer Institute of International Studies); and presented the idea of the \\"hidden peoples,\\" which later became synonymous with the phrase \\"unreached peoples,\\" at the 1974 Lausanne Congress in Switzerland.  Later life and works  After the 1974 Lausanne Congress, Winter and his wife Roberta felt there needed to be a place to tackle cultural and linguistic barriers hindering the sharing of the Gospel with all peoples. In 1976, Winter left his secure, tenured position at Fuller Theological Seminary to focus on calling attention to the unreached peoples. In November 1976, the Winters founded the mission think tank USCWM with no staff but their secretary and only $100 in cash. Ralph (right) and Roberta (left) Winter on the campus of William Carey International University in Pasadena, Calif. Calling himself a \\"Christian social engineer,\\" Winter helped found a number of other organizations and groups, including William Carey Library, William Carey International University (1977), the International Society for Frontier Missiology (1986), and the Institute for the Study of the Origins of Disease (1999). In the last year of his life, Winter helped organize the Tokyo 2010 Global Mission Consultation, which was held in May 2010. Tokyo 2010 brought together around 1,000 mission leaders to discuss the unfinished task of reaching the world's remaining least-reached peoples. Steve Richardson argues that Winter \\"effectively reframed the unfinished task and the church's understanding of the Great Commission in terms of reaching unreached ethnolinguistic people groups.\\"  Recognition  In 2005, Winter was named by Time magazine as one of the 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America. He was presented the 2008 Lifetime of Service Award at the North American Mission Leaders Conference.  Death  Winter died on May 20, 2009, at the age of 84 from multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Family Winter's first wife, Roberta, died of multiple myeloma in 2001, just six weeks shy of their 50th anniversary. He remarried on July 6, 2002, to Barbara Scotchmer, a long-time family friend. In total, Winter had four daughters (Elizabeth, Rebecca, Linda and Patricia) with Roberta. All four of his daughters are involved in mission activities. At the time of his death, Winter had 14 grandchildren, two great- granddaughters and one great-grandson. He had two brothers, David K. Winter, president of Westmont College for many years, and Paul Winter, structural engineer. His parents were Hazel Clare (Patterson) Winter and Hugo H.

Written by Kia Corthron from a story by Ed Burns & Kia Corthron, and directed by Alex Zakrzewski, it originally aired on November 12, 2006.  Plot summary  =Bodie's crew= Poot returns to the streets from prison after having been arrested alongside Avon Barksdale and many of his lieutenants and soldiers in Season 3. Bodie tells him about how Marlo was able to threaten the crew into working under him, but Poot does not mind the change of leadership, stating that one boss is the same as the next. Herc and Dozerman pull up in a patrol car, looking for Little Kevin to question in Lex's murder. Nobody tells Herc their names. Recognizing only Bodie and Poot, he says everyone under 5'6\\" and 150 lbs. goes into the wagon, and the three smallest corner boys are snatched up. Not realizing that Kevin's nickname is a joke on his portly size, Herc and Dozerman leave the real Little Kevin on the street. Bodie delineates Namond's new corners, having been pressured by De'Londa, insisting that Namond keep his mother from interceding again. As they work their corner, Carver and Colicchio catch Namond's crew unprepared. The corner boys flee, but eight-year-old Kenard is not fast enough. Carver destroys the stash of vials and lets Kenard go, claiming that it is not worth processing. When Carver catches up with Namond, Donut, and Kenard at Cutty's gym, he chastises them for being so careless and warns them that the next time he catches them dealing drugs, he will beat them and send them to be processed for juvenile detention. =Politics= Carcetti attends a meeting with city leaders to inform him of the issues facing Baltimore as he heads toward his mayoral term. On the matter of growing the tax base, Carcetti raises the idea of adding casinos to the waterfront, but it is shot down. The city council president, Campbell, finds it suspicious that Carcetti wants to give a pay raise to the position of commissioner, given Burrell's recent poor performance, and explains how such a raise will never make it into the budget. Later, in private, Campbell tells Carcetti that Royce had groomed her to be his successor. She seems angry at both Carcetti and Gray for jumping the line to take Royce's position as mayor, given their more junior status in the city council. Carcetti admits to being ignorant of this relationship, and hints that she may become mayor, being first in the line of succession, if he decides to run for governor in two years time. Carcetti, Norman Wilson, and Delegate Watkins agree that firing Burrell is off the table because of the potential backlash of his black voters at the idea of a white mayor firing a black police commissioner. Carcetti tries to coax Burrell into stepping down, but Burrell understands the racial situation in which the mayor-elect finds himself and refuses to leave quietly, claiming that he will only do so if he is fired. Instead, Carcetti tells William Rawls that Burrell is to undertake no initiative as Commissioner without clearing it through him first. He then requests two promotions: Stan Valchek to Deputy Commissioner of Administration for helping him throughout the campaign, and Major Cedric Daniels will become C.I.D. Colonel, filling the late Ray Foerster's position. Carcetti claims that he wants to give Daniels carte blanche to reform the investigative units. Daniels tells Rhonda Pearlman that there's a chance Baltimore might be able to turn itself around under the new administration. She, Carver, Greggs and Sydnor are present at the promotion ceremony. =Bubbles= Bubbles tracks down Kima Greggs and tells her about the other junkie who has been assaulting and robbing him constantly. She tells him that, as a homicide detective, there is little she can do for him, but offers to put him in touch with Herc. The latter meets Bubbles and tells him he's looking for Little Kevin. Bubbles reuses his \\"hat trick\\" from Season 1, visiting Bodie's crew, pretending to sell hats, and placing a red hat on Kevin as Herc watches from a distance. As Herc and Dozerman see the red hat go onto the real Little Kevin, the fattest member of the crew, they are both chagrined at their earlier stupidity in not having realized that Kevin's nickname was ironic. In return, Herc promises Bubbles to come within five minutes the next time his aggressor shows up again. That night, Bubbles catches sight of the assailant in an alley. He quickly phones the major crimes unit from a payphone and leaves a message with Dozerman for Herc to come immediately. Herc is busy interrogating Little Kevin, whom he has brought in for questioning over Lex's murder. Herc gets Bubs' message and tells Dozerman to call Bubbles back and tell him to wait until tomorrow, forgetting that Bubs has no cell phone. Bubs sees a police car come down the street and makes his move, announcing his presence to his tormentor. But Herc is not in the car, and the driver does not see the two dope fiends' altercation. Bubs is once again badly beaten by his antagonist. Meanwhile, Herc's interrogation of Little Kevin is fruitless. In an attempt to get Kevin to admit to witnessing the murder, Herc tells him that he's already talked to an informant who places him at the crime scene. When Kevin inquires if Randy is the person that he has talked to, Herc tips his hand by not making any inquiries about the name. Detective Sydnor leaves in disgust at Herc's attempt to interrogate Little Kevin. Sydnor tells Dozerman that they aren't going to get anywhere as they have no charges against him to use as leverage, which Sydnor believes from past experience is key to making an interrogation work. =Prez's class= Prez sets his math class to work in groups. Watching Dukie use the class computer, Randy discovers that he can buy candy online in bulk and increase his profits, but he needs a credit card. They ask for Prez to order the candy with his card, stating that the business helps improve his arithmetic. Prez agrees on the condition that he receive the cash upfront, but warns Randy and Dukie against selling drugs to get the money more quickly. As he and Dukie pass men playing craps in the alleyway after school, Randy decides to wager money. Putting the probability skills he learned in class to work, he wins big and has enough cash to present to Prez the next day. Prez is not happy that Randy gambled, but orders the bulk candy anyway as promised. At a faculty meeting, Assistant Principal Marcia Donnelly announces that all teachers, even those in math, will help their students prepare for the reading comprehension portion of the standardized tests coming in the spring. The new material is meant to teach the students how to answer the test questions correctly, but is repetitive and leaves the students unable to grasp any of the language concepts they are supposed to be learning. The sole purpose is to improve the school's test scores. Prez draws a comparison with \\"juking the stats\\" in the police department. His class is bored by the new material, and their practice test answers show that none of them understand it. Prez says that he doesn't care about his evaluation and that he is not going to try to teach the reading comprehension test preparation anymore. =School pilot program= Elsewhere at Tilghman Middle School, the special class presents a teamwork challenge to the \\"corner kids.\\" They are divided into groups and made to assemble model buildings from kits, with no instructions included. Howard Colvin promises a dinner downtown to the group that builds its model the fastest. Namond, Zenobia, and Darnell build a seemingly sturdy Eiffel Tower, with Namond pocketing the pieces that didn't appear to fit anywhere. Colvin is suspicious, but declares them the winners. True to his word, Colvin takes the three students to Ruth's Chris Steak House, a high-class establishment by the waterfront. The evening starts well, with Namond appreciating Colvin's Billie Holiday music and the students looking forward to a new experience. But once inside, Darnell and Namond find the atmosphere overwhelming and intimidating and fail to even pretend to grasp the restaurant protocol or enjoy the experience. After they finish dinner and leave the steakhouse disappointed, all three refusing Colvin's offer to take a picture, Darnell asks to go to McDonald's for french fries and Namond cranks up hip-hop on the radio over Colvin's protestations. The next day, Colvin discusses the experience with Dr. Parenti. He tells him that the students were capable of behaving well and enjoying something new, but reverted to their \\"corner kid\\" ways without even realizing it once they felt stifled. He expresses his worry that this lack of self-awareness on the kids' part is a barrier to future progress. Colvin then sees the group boasting to the rest of the students that the dinner was amazing. =Kima= Kima is surprised and delighted to find how well working overtime in homicide pays. She goes to her old apartment to visit her ex- girlfriend Cheryl and their son, Elijah, and pay her overdue share of housing expenses. Kima hopes they can get back together, but just then Cheryl's new partner, a lawyer named Nancine, appears. Kima exits, and Cheryl has Elijah wave goodbye to \\"Aunt Kima.\\" =Marlo= Proposition Joe informs Marlo that Herc is now working for the Major Crimes Unit; the same unit that brought down Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell. He advises Marlo to stop using cell phones. Chris and Snoop have successfully driven off the New York dealers. Chris has learned that Omar is no longer in the city jail. Marlo suggests that the charges against Omar may have been dropped since Andre has closed his shop. Finding Andre is now their top priority. Chris and Snoop break into Andre's house and threaten his girlfriend, who swears she does not know his whereabouts. Marlo's soldiers believe her and decide not to kill her. Andre has gone over to East Baltimore to ask Prop Joe to help him leave town until he is safe from Marlo. Prop Joe offers him $2000 plus a ride to a northern city in exchange for Andre's convenience store. Andre says this is undervalued. Prop Joe points out that Andre is not in a position to bargain. When Marlo pays Prop Joe for his package, he expects a discount for dealing with the New York threat. Joe tells him this has already been factored into the cost. Joe, however, indicates to Marlo that \\"something that you want\\" is about to be returned at no cost. When Slim Charles drives Andre to one of the vacant houses, Andre protests that Slim Charles was supposed to be his way out. Charles quips \\"In a manner of speaking, that be true\\". Chris and Snoop are there with their lime and sheeting. Andre begs Chris to shoot him in a place where his family will find him, but Chris insists that \\"here is good\\" and walks Andre up to the house. =Omar= When Omar is released from the Harford County Detention Center he finds Bunk waiting for him. He demands that Omar promise not to kill anyone in revenge for his false imprisonment: \\"no more bodies on this.\\" Omar gives his word as his bond. Bunk offers him a ride to the train station, but Omar insists on staying in Baltimore. Omar and Renaldo wait in their van outside Andre's store, with Omar assuring his boyfriend that he intends to keep his promise to Bunk, but that merely threatening Andre with a gun should be fair game. They leave when it is clear to them that Andre is not there. Omar and Renaldo end up staking out the public square where they know Marlo spends much of his time. They recognize him from the card game they had robbed. Renaldo points out Michael with Marlo, but Omar says that he is just a kid. =Michael= Michael continues to be disturbed by the return of Bug's father. He shoos Bug from the room when the man enters, and refuses to be touched by him in any way. Michael asks Randy and Dukie what will happen if he calls social services. Randy says they will split him and his brother up and put them in group homes, and won't simply take away Michael's stepdad like he wants. Michael is escorted by Dukie to Marlo's courtyard and allowed to enter. He tells Marlo that he needs Chris, telling him that \\"I got a problem I can't bring to no one else.\\"  Production  =Title reference= The kids from Colvin's class find themselves out of place dining at a fancy restaurant, which Colvin worries will stop them from achieving in the world. The title also refers to Carcetti keeping the high-up police in line, as well as Carcetti being challenged by Nerese Campbell in the first budget meeting. =Epigraph= Proposition Joe remarks that instead of trying to repair an object that's broken or defective, it's more cost- effective to just get a new one. This also parallels the fate of Old Face Andre. =Credits= Starring cast Although credited, Dominic West and Glynn Turman do not appear in this episode.

He was shot dead in a Johannesburg bar. Hundred on debut Harvey-Walker was born in East Ham, London and educated at Strathallan School in Perthshire, where he was in the first XI for five years. After school he joined Warwickshire in 1963 and played for the second XI team. He moved to Derbyshire in 1967 where he also played in the second XI. In the 1971 season he made his first team debut. He became the first Derbyshire cricketer to score a century on his debut scoring an unbeaten 110 against Oxford University at Burton-on- Trent. Career Harvey-Walker was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break and medium-pace bowler. Early in his career he played purely as a top order batsman, though he struggled to hold down a regular place in a weak batting side. His best season was in 1974 when he scored 727 runs at 25.96, and also scored 448 List 'A' runs. In June 1975, during a match between Derbyshire and Lancashire at Buxton, a highly unseasonal snowstorm took place. To that date, it was the only first-class cricket match in history whereby, 'snow stopped play', in what was one of the hottest summers on record. Shortly after the thaw set in, Harvey-Walker came out to bat and surprised square leg umpire Dickie Bird by asking him to look after his false teeth, wrapped in a handkerchief, because he wouldn't be in for long! Not regarded as a regular bowler much beforehand, he was regularly employed when selected in the 1978 season, taking 10‚Äì82, including 7‚Äì35 in the second innings against Surrey on the notoriously uncertain wicket at Ilkeston. Despite playing in the 1978 Benson & Hedges Cup Final he was not re-engaged at the end of the season in a general clearout by the County.1979 Derbyshire Yearbook Following his release from Derbyshire, he played for Undercliffe Cricket Club in the Bradford Cricket League and then emigrated to South Africa. He was working as assistant groundsman at the Wanderers Stadium in Johnannesburg, and only a month before his death had helped to prepare the pitch for the Test against Australia. Death On 28 April 1997, at the age of 52, Harvey-Walker was shot dead at a private club in the Berea neighbourhood of Johannesburg. Apparently, a gunman walked into the bar, called out Harvey-Walker's name, and shot him when he responded.\\"Death by Misadventure\\" by P Thorn & K.Bartlett.

It has a 12th-century chapel on its . Most of the present building was constructed in the 18th century, but an attached hall dates from the 13th century. Warwick the Kingmaker reportedly dined at Swainston Manor. It is a Grade II* listed building. Swainston is derived from its original name, \\"Sweyn's Town\\". It was founded by king Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, whose son was King Canute. The parish of Calbourne was at one time dependent on Swainston Manor. The poet Alfred Lord Tennyson also visited Swainston a few times. It is claimed that he wrote \\"Maud\\" on its grounds. He also wrote \\"In the Garden at Swainston\\" after the death of his friend and Swainston's owner, Sir John Simeon. The house was severely damaged by incendiary bombs during World War II. The church on the site, however, was untouched. Swainstone was one of the locations for the King James School during the 1960s. Other locations for the school included Newport and Cowes.

Abstract state machines are known for their versatility in modeling of algorithms, architectures, languages, protocols, and virtually all kinds of sequential, parallel, and distributed systems. The ASM formalism has been studied extensively by researchers in academia and industry for more than 15 years with the intention to bridge the gap between formal and pragmatic approaches. Model-based systems engineering can benefit from abstract executable specifications as a tool for design exploration and experimental validation through simulation and testing. Building on experiences with two generations of ASM tools, a novel executable ASM language, called CoreASM, is being developed (see CoreASM homepage). The CoreASM language emphasizes freedom of experimentation, and supports the evolutionary nature of design as a product of creativity. It is particularly suited to Exploring the problem space for the purpose of writing an initial specification. The CoreASM language allows writing of highly abstract and concise specifications by minimizing the need for encoding in mapping the problem space to a formal model, and by allowing explicit declaration of the parts of the specification that are purposely left abstract. The principle of minimality, in combination with robustness of the underlying mathematical framework, improves modifiability of specifications, while effectively supporting the highly iterative nature of specification and design.

Theory In 1911, a German sociologist, Robert Michels propounded a view that all democratic organisations were prone to become oligarchies because of the growth and size of modern organisations, the need for specialisation of officials, and the necessity that this division of labour would lead the rank and file to struggle to understand the activities of their leaders. Michels argued that this amounted to an iron law of oligarchy: all groups, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, eventually and inevitably develop into oligarchies with swollen bureaucracies. Michels himself, after falling out with the German Social Democrat Party, migrated to Italy and joined Mussolini's Fascist Party. Nevertheless, his ideas were popularized after the Second World War in particular by Seymour Martin Lipset, Trow, and James Samuel Coleman in a book entitled, Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union (1957). This book argued that the ITU was an exception to Michels' general law, and that the conditions necessary to ensure democracy were that an opposition to the union's leadership could form. This depended on ensuring the leadership did not monopolize the channels of communication with members. Lipset and his coauthors confined their understanding of \\"democracy\\" to the existence of organised opposition. They were skeptical that the conditions in the ITU, which made it democratic, were likely to arise in many other unions spontaneously. Following this, in 1959, the US Federal government passed the Landrum-Griffin Act 1959 to mandate democratic principles be followed in union governance. Law *International Labour Organization, Freedom of Association Convention (1948) No 87 *US Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act 1959 *UK Trade Union Act 1984, now in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s 72 Principles Principles include: *Frequent, contested elections, with rank- and-file members regularly challenging incumbents, and resultant turnover in officers and representatives, with all candidates having equal access to membership lists before elections, including the right to copy the list. *Open publications, with newsletters and websites publishing all members' views, including those critical of officials, representatives, or union policy, and the union encouraging open and free debate and discussion of issues and candidates; with election candidates having equal use of union publications and means of communication (website, newsletter, e-mail list) to put out their campaign material. *Member ratification, with all contracts and \\"side agreements\\" between union and management subject to ratification by secret ballot by the members covered by the contract. *Strike votes: members should vote on striking, on return to work, and on other decisions during strikes, with strike votes not used to force members to ratify contracts (\\"either you vote 'yes' or you vote to strike\\"). *\\"Informed vote\\": the complete text of proposed contract changes, amendments, referendums, etc. should be distributed to members prior to ratification votes, with sufficient time for meaningful membership review and discussion, and the union circulating (or at least not obstructing) different opinions about the contract offer. *Election of representatives: shop stewards, business agents and other member representatives (paid or otherwise) should be elected by secret ballot of the members they represent, and subject to recall by the members they represent; stewards and active members should be trained in legal rights and organizing; and there should be stewards' councils that meet to plan and coordinate action. *Grievants' rights: workers should participate fully in the grievance process at every step, with full information about their case and its progress. *Member access to information: union representatives should provide members current and complete copies of the contract and the union constitution/bylaws, and the contract and constitution should be published on union websites. Members must have easy access to information on officers' salaries, budget, and expenses. Union representatives should regularly inform members of their rights under national and local law, and how to enforce them, including rights and responsibilities under the relevant regulations. *Regular local meetings, to be at least quarterly, announced ahead of time, at a time and place convenient to members, with an agenda circulated in advance, under reasonable quorum requirements not set so high as to prevent valid membership meetings. Real business should be conducted (not just a pep rally), with members encouraged to speak, make proposals, vote, and ask questions, and meeting minutes available to all members afterwards. *Independent organizing and communication outside union official structure: members should have the right to organize in independent committees and caucuses, publish rank-and- file newsletters and websites, and run candidates for union office, and union officers should encourage this. *Inclusion and equality: all members should be treated fairly, with the union fighting discrimination by management and among members. Union officers and representatives should reflect membership in terms of gender, race, language, craft or bargaining unit, seniority, etc. Union contracts, constitution and bylaws, meetings, and publications should be accessible in the languages spoken by members. *Education for members: unions should train all interested members in legal rights and organizing, including how to participate effectively in the union and how to organize on the job. While there are some superficial similarities to the so-called organizing model of union activity, advocates of union democracy are swift to point out that many of the alleged exemplars of the organizing model do not, in their internal structure, meet the requirements listed above.

Born in the Finger Lakes region of New York, he started painting signs and portraits as a young man. In 1842 he traveled to the American West to paint Native American life. In 1846 he exhibited a gallery of 85 of his paintings in Cincinnati and Louisville. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he joined Colonel Stephen Watts Kearney's expedition to California and painted accounts of the campaign, as well as aspects of the Oregon Territory. Stanley continued to travel and paint in the West, and mounted a major exhibit of more than 150 works at the Smithsonian Institution in 1852. Although he had some Congressional interest in purchasing the collection, he was unsuccessful in completing a sale to the government. He never recovered his expenses for a decade of intensive work and travel. In 1854 he exhibited a 42-scene panorama of western scenes in Washington, DC: Baltimore, New York and London, but it has been lost. More than 200 of his paintings, maps and other work being held at the Smithsonian were lost in an 1865 fire. The irreparable loss of most of his works caused the eclipse of Stanley's reputation for some time in American art history. His appreciation and portrayal of the American West is valued, and today his few surviving works are held by national and numerous regional museums. Early life and education John Mix Stanley was born in Canandaigua, New York to Seth and Sally (McKinney) Stanley. He was orphaned at the age of 12. At age 14, Stanley was\`apprenticed to a coach maker. He taught himself painting skills, and at the age of 20 moved to Detroit, the largest city in the Michigan Territory, and started doing itinerant work. Career River in a Mountain Landscape, oil on canvas painting by John Mix Stanley, c. 1840s Stanley moved to what was considered the frontier town of Detroit in 1832, where he became an itinerant painter of signs and portraits. He traveled also to Fort Snelling, Galena and Chicago. In the latter part of the decade, he returned East, apparently to Washington, D.C., where he briefly had a studio.Robert Taft, \\"THE PICTORIAL RECORD OF THE OLD WEST: XV. John M. Stanley and the Pacific Railroad Reports\\", Kansas Historical Quarterly, Vol. XX, February 1952, at Internet Archive, accessed 22 May 2011 In 1842, accompanied by Sumner Dickerman of Troy, New York as an assistant, Stanley went to the American Southwest expressly to paint Native Americans, perhaps inspired by the work of the artist George Catlin. They settled at Fort Gibson in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma); the community was a crossroads of many Indian nations. In the summer of 1843, Stanley went to the council at Tahlequah called by the Cherokee chief John Ross and the Republic of Texas. An estimated 10,000 Native Americans of 17 tribes attended to negotiate peace with Texas, as did many European Americans. Stanley spent four weeks there and worked intensely through the next three months to complete his numerous paintings of individuals and tribal groups. He also spent more time with Cherokee and Creek groups, painting portraits. That fall he accompanied the party of the US Indian agent Pierce M. Butler to a council with Comanche and other Plains Indians, probably in southwest Oklahoma near present-day Texas. In early 1846 in Cincinnati, Ohio, he and Dickerman exhibited a gallery of 85 paintings of Indians, which received favorable reviews there and in Louisville, Kentucky. Stanley left Dickerman in charge and returned to the West. At the outbreak of the Mexican War in 1846, Stanley was appointed a draftsman for the Corps of Topographical Engineers to Colonel Stephen Watts Kearney's expedition to California and the Oregon Territory. He produced many sketches and paintings of the campaign, making more finished paintings after reaching San Francisco in early 1847. Some works were reproduced as engravings. He traveled further north to the Oregon and Washington territories to paint landscapes and various Native American tribes, and worked through part of 1848.Forbes (1992) That year Stanley traveled to Hawaii, where he spent nearly twelve months painting portraits of King Kamehameha III, his wife, and the royal family. After his return to the East, he organized his large gallery of Indian portraits and paintings to be mounted in several cities, including New York. In 1852 he gained a major exhibit in Washington, DC at the Smithsonian Institution of his Native American Gallery, which attracted much attention in the city. As he noted in the preface to the catalogue published by the Smithsonian, Stanley portrayed 43 tribes. His paintings represented a decade of work, with extensive travel in the West and the Hawaiian Islands. Nellie B. Pipes, \\"John Mix Stanley, Indian Painter\\", Oregon Historical Quarterly, Vol. 33, No. 3, September 1932, accessed 22 May 2011 His collection numbered nearly 200 works and was celebrated at the time. Seth Eastman, also an artist of Native American life, wrote to Stanley of his gallery: \\"that I consider the artistic merits of yours far superior to Mr. Catlin's; and they give a better idea of the Indian than any works in Mr. Catlin's collection.\\" Stanley interested members of the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in purchasing his gallery, but could not gain approval; and the Smithsonian did not have sufficient funds to purchase it. He struggled financially, trying to keep his collection together in hopes of gaining Congressional support, rather than sell it privately. In 1853, Stanley was appointed chief artist at a salary of $125 per month for Isaac I. Stevens' expedition to survey a northern railroad route to the Pacific Coast; he made the most of this chance for travel and work in the Northwest. They traveled from St. Paul Minnesota Territory to the Washington Territory. Stanley observed gatherings of nearly 1500 Assiniboine, traveled to a distant Blackfoot (Piegan) village, and saw a large hunting party of several hundred, including families from the Pembina area near the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The latter were known as the Red River of the North hunters. They were generations of European and mixed-race trappers who lived on the frontier and had Indian wives and mixed-race children. (In Canada descendants of such families have achieved recognition as the M√©tis ethnic group). They had come to the area for bison hunting, as the herds were still vast on the prairies. Stanley painted and sketched many Northwest landmarks, which were reproduced in lithographs for inclusion in Stevens' last volume of the Pacific Railroad Reports. These gained wide circulation and added to Stanley's reputation. His portraits of two early Oregon settlers are held by the Oregon Historical Society. Later in the West, he painted Comanche warriors in their natural environment. The party returned that year to the East, crossing the Isthmus of Panama from the west and arriving by ship in New York in January 1854. After his return, Stanley worked intensely at painting and organizing a large panorama of western scenes from the northern survey route. His exhibition of 42 scenes went on display in Washington, DC on September 1, 1854, accompanied by a 23-page booklet of descriptions. Visitors said they needed two hours to see everything in the panorama. This exhibit represented the last of Stanley's great western adventures and was highly praised by Washington papers. It was shown in Baltimore for three weeks, and went on tour to New York and London. The panorama later disappeared, and historians have not been able to trace it. Stanley returned to Detroit in 1864, where he set up his art studio. He essentially remained in Detroit the rest of his life, helping to found a forerunner of the Detroit Institute of Arts and its School of Arts. He also helped incorporate the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; originally he had hoped his Indian gallery would be the basis of its collection. More than 200 of his works, as well as many of his maps and other documentation, were destroyed in the Smithsonian fire of 1865. =Indian atlas= Stanley intended to produce an atlas of the American Indian but, after the loss of most of his paintings in 1865, never completed it. Only eight leaves exist. Probably written in the winter of 1868‚Äì1869, these include his preface, as well as pages describing three plates: a Plains Indian encampment, Chinook burial ground, and a buffalo hunt. Stanley described what the plates represent and also provided historical and cultural information about each tribe or area.This information may be found online at www.catalog.library.cornell edu, but was followed up by contact with the Rare Book librarian, Cornell University, September 2008 (OR). =Maps= As an artist-explorer, Stanley had traveled extensively, especially in the American West. He created a large collection of maps, which was held by the Smithsonian Institution. They were also destroyed in the 1865 fire. Paintings of Native Americans Buffalo Hunt on the Southwestern Prairies, 1845, Smithsonian American Art Museum Stanley's primary interest and sympathies were with the American Indians. The Smithsonian had a large and successful exhibit of his paintings in 1852, but Congress never appropriated monies to acquire them. More than 200 of his works, as well as many of his maps and other documentation, were destroyed in the Smithsonian fire of 1865. This loss likely contributed to the decline in his reputation and lack of knowledge about him in later American art history.

Route description Wyoming Highway 24 northbound toward Devil's Tower WYO 24 is spawned from US 14 at Carlile Junction (also known as Devils Tower Junction). From there, it travels in a north‚Äìsouth direction, although the route is signed east‚Äìwest. It is mainly a two-lane highway from US 14 to near Devils Tower National Monument. When it gets to Devils Tower, it spawns a short spur, Wyoming Highway 110. After passing by WYO 110, it then curves northeast-southwest. The road reaches Hulett, where it intersects Wyoming Highway 112. In Hulett, WYO 24 is dubbed Main Street and A Street. Moving on, WYO 24 curves to the signed east‚Äìwest orientation, but curves northwest- southeast. WYO 24 passes by some gulches, most notably Reservoir Gulch and Lucky Gulch. WYO 24 then turns south, then generally follows the east‚Äìwest orientation. It then intersects Wyoming Highway 111 a short time later. There are no further major junctions and towns on the route, as WYO 24 crosses the state line and becomes South Dakota Highway 34. History Wyoming Highway 24 was not in the original State Highway grid until 1961. The predecessor to this route was Wyoming Highway 514.

US 80/SR 26 was designated on SR 21 from Bay Street to Ogeechee Road. Upon departing I-516/SR 21, US 80/SR 26 traveled on US 17S to Abercorn Street, where US 17S ended. The next year, US 17S was decommissioned. In 1995, US 17 was shifted off of I-516/US 80/SR 21/SR 25/SR 26 north of I-16 and onto I-16 and SR 404 Spur. In 2017, it was planned to extended Jimmy DeLoach Parkway from its current southern terminus at US 80/SR 17/SR 26, partially along the path of Bloomingdale Road (from SR 17's current southern terminus at I-16 to just south of its intersection with the northern terminus of Pine Barren Road). Construction on the extension began in 2018. Future The at- grade intersection at Jimmy DeLoach Parkway's current southern terminus is to be converted into a full diamond interchange. The extension of the parkway is planned to be designated as SR 1251 until it is opened. The former alignment of SR 17 is planned to be redesignated as SR 17 Spur. Also, the eastern end of Osteen Road, which lies on the right-of-way of the extension, is to be shifted to the west. Major intersections Special routes =Hawkinsville spur route= State Route 26 Spur (SR 26 Spur) was a spur route of SR 26 that existed in the central part of Hawkinsville. It was entirely in the central part of Pulaski County. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, it was established and paved from US 129 north/US 341 south/SR 27/SR 230/SR 257 (Broad Street) to US 129 south/US 341 north/SR 26 (Commerce Street). Between the beginning of 1984 and the beginning of 1992, SR 26 Spur was decommissioned and redesignated as US 341 Truck/SR 230 Truck. =Hartford connector route= State Route 26 Connector (SR 26 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 26 that existed in Hartford in the central part of Pulaski County. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, it was established from US 129/US 341 north/SR 26/SR 27 south/SR 257 to US 341/SR 27\\\\. It was entirely concurrent with US 341 north/SR 27. Between the beginning of 1984 and the beginning of 1992, it was decommissioned. =Garden City connector route= State Route 26 Connector (SR 26 Conn.) is a connector route that exists entirely within the north-central part of Chatham County. The entire route is in the northeastern part of Garden City. It is known as Burnsed Boulevard for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with US 80/SR 26\\\\. The highway curves to the north-northeast until it meets its northern terminus, an interchange with I-516/SR 21/SR 25. The entire length of SR 6 Conn. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. Between the beginning of 1977 and the end of 1985, SR 26 Conn. was established on its current path. =Savannah loop route= State Route 26 Loop (SR 26 Loop) was a loop route that existed entirely within the central part of Chatham County. Most of it was in the city limits of Savannah. All of its routing was later used for the route of I-516. Between June 1960 and June 1963, SR 26 Loop was established and paved on DeRenne Avenue from Montgomery Street to southeast of Savannah. It was proposed to be built from US 17/US 80/SR 17/SR 25/SR 26 on the northwestern edge of Savannah south- southwest to just south of US 17/SR 25 and then east-southeast to Montgomery Street. By the end of 1965, it was proposed to be extended from DeRenne Avenue/La Roche Avenue north-northeast to US 80/SR 26 west-northwest of Thunderbolt. In 1966, the loop was under construction from Augusta Avenue to Liberty Parkway. It was completed from Liberty Parkway to Montgomery Street. The next year, the segment from Liberty Parkway to I-16 was indicated to \\"open spring '68\\". In 1968, SR 26 Loop was open from I-16 to Liberty Parkway. In 1970, the loop was open from Augusta Avenue to I-16. It was proposed to be extended to US 17/US 80/SR 25/SR 26 southeast of Fair Street. In 1977, this extension was open. In 1978, it was redesignated as part of an eastern extension of SR 21. =Savannah connector route= State Route 26 Connector (SR 26 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 26 that existed in the central part of Chatham County. It was in the western part of Savannah. Between the beginning of 1945 and the end of 1946, US 17/SR 25 entered Savannah from the southwest on Ogeechee Street. They turned right onto 37th Street and left onto US 80/SR 26 (Montgomery Street). In 1953, US 17/SR 25's northbound and southbound lanes split. Their northbound lanes traveled on Mills B. Lane Boulevard, 52nd Street, and curved left onto Montgomery Street. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, SR 25 Spur was designated on US 17's northbound lanes. SR 25 only traveled on US 17's southbound lanes. In 1969, it was redesignated as SR 26 Conn. In 1985, the connector was decommissioned. =Whitemarsh Island‚ÄìWilmington Island loop route= State Route 26 Loop (SR 26 Loop) was an east‚Äìwest loop route of SR 26 that was located in the east- central part of the state. It was completely within Chatham County in the Savannah metropolitan area. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, it was established from US 80/SR 26 in Whitemarsh Island, then southeast over Turner Creek, then northeast and north-northeast to US 80/SR 26 in Wilmington Island. Its entire length was hard surfaced. In 1969, it was redesignated as SR 367. =Savannah Beach spur route= State Route 26 Spur (SR 26 Spur) was a spur route of SR 26 that existed in two parts in Savannah Beach, what Tybee Island was known as at the time. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, the western segment of SR 26 Spur was established between two intersections with US 80/SR 26 in the northern part of the city. It traveled on North Campbell Avenue, Van Horne Avenue, Taylor Street, Meddin Drive, Cedarwood Avenue, another segment of Van Horne Avenue, and 2nd Avenue. An eastern segment was established from US 80/SR 26 east-southeast to SR 26 Loop in the southern part of the city. In 1969, both segments of the spur route were decommissioned. =Savannah Beach loop route= State Route 26 Loop (SR 26 Loop) was a loop route of SR 26 that existed in the eastern part of Chatham County, in Savannah Beach, which is what Tybee Island was known at the time.

Life Born into poverty in Glasgow, Simpson went on to become one of the leading 'special artists' of his day, and sketched many scenes of war for the Illustrated London News. His early years were very difficult living in a house with an abusive and alcoholic father, and in 1834 he was sent to live with his grandmother in Perth. Simpson's only formal schooling took place during this period and within a few years, he was working as an apprentice in the Glasgow lithographic firm of Macfarlane. The artist stated later that \\"this was the turning point which changed all my boyish intentions.\\" It was during the years in Glasgow that he attended the Andersonian University and the Mechanics Institute in the evenings. Bomarsund during the √Öland War; lithograph from The Seat of the War in the East His next position was to create an image of the Alma based on various accounts so that it could be lithographed by another London publisher, Lloyd's. He also put sketches sent from the Baltic onto stone for the firm of Colnaghi. In anticipation of the fall of Sebastopol, Lloyd's had him prepare an image of the fall of the town so that it could be published immediately upon news of its actual capture. This presented a challenge to Simpson as he had little information about Sebastopol. He occasionally spoke with Mr. Day of Day and Son about the need to have sketches drawn at the front. Shortly thereafter, Colnaghi's contacted Simpson and invited him to go out to the Crimea and make sketches for the company. Crimean War Cathecart Hill before Sebastapol. Crimea. 1855. Simpson arrived off the Crimean peninsula on 15 November 1854 and could hear distant firing. While he had missed the early battles, he was able to record the events before Sebastopol. He made numerous acquaintances who helped him with details for his pictures, but he was also struck by the plight of the common soldiers, \\"miserable looking beings...covered with mud, dirt, and rags,\\" he wrote. He hobnobbed with many officers including Lord Raglan and Captain Peel; he also met Roger Fenton who took his photograph. In May 1855, Simpson accompanied Raglan on the expedition to Kertch which was captured on the 24th, but was back in time to observe the first attack on Sebastopol in June. On the night of the 17th, he crawled out of a trench to view the attack. He wrote, \\"It was a wild orchestra of sound, never to be forgotten.\\" He was still at the front when the city finally surrendered, and he quit the Crimea in the autumn of 1855. \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava,\\" lithograph from The Seat of the War in the East Throughout his time at the front, he would send back his water-colors to London where the lithographers of Day & Son would transfer them to stone. Simpson was paid 20 pounds for each picture. For the color, a separate stone was used for each tone. Colnaghis exhibited some of the water-colors including a show at the Graphic Society in February 1855. The first advertisements for the lithographs appeared in May 1855 and in the following month, a second series was announced. Another of his works for the Colnaghis, showing Queen Victoria, to whom the image is dedicated, visiting HMS Resolute. In all, the Colnaghis produced two large portfolios containing over eighty lithographs entitled The Seat of the War in the East. Two thousand copies of the complete set were produced. Simpson dedicated the series to Queen Victoria whose patronage he enjoyed for the rest of his life, and he was a frequent visitor to Windsor Castle and Balmoral. So popular were his pictures that he became affectionately known at 'Crimean Simpson'. There was a plan for the water- colors to be purchased for the nation but this came to nothing and they were sold-off by the Colnaghi's. India and Abyssinia Return visit of the Viceroy to the Maharaja of Cashmere In the late 1850s he was sent to India to sketch scenes relating to the recent Sepoy Revolt. The idea was to produce an illustrated publication similar to the Crimean portfolio, and Simpson had discussed the possibility with Mr. Day. The artist arrived at Calcutta on 29 October 1859, and traveled in Punjab, Sutlej, Bengal, Lucknow and Cawnpore, central India, the Himalayas, Kashmir and Madras. In February, 1862, he left Bombay and arrived in London only to find that Day and Son could not afford to produce a portfolio. Nevertheless, a large volume of colored lithographs was published under the title India Ancient and Modern. He was commissioned by Day & Son to visit these parts of India and record the places affected by the momentous events of the 'Mutiny' of 1857. Before leaving, he spent 'a considerable time in the library of the India House, then in Leadenhall Street, looking over books about India, such as Daniels', to see what had been already done, and to get hints as to places I ought to visit'. The set of lithographs produced, based on his watercolours, was intended to rival David Roberts' Holy Land in scope. However, the project never came to fruition. This was caused by the financial collapse of Day & Son, due to the rise of wood engraving. By 1866, Simpson had delivered 250 watercolours to Day & Son and these were subsequently sold off as bankrupt stock. Only 50 had been prepared as chromolithographs, and were published in 1867 as India ancient and modern. A series of illustrations of the country and people of India and adjacent territories. For Simpson this was little consolation: 'So the great work on India, on which I had bestowed so much time and labour, never came into existence...' In 1866, Simpson was contacted by the Illustrated London News to do some sketches of the Prince of Wales, on a visit to the Duke of Sutherland at Dunrobin Castle. Afterwards, the paper asked him to go to St. Petersburg and cover the Prince of Wales's attendance at the marriage of the Czarevich, afterward Emperor Alexander III. Two years later, Simpson was out in Abyssinia covering the campaign that had broken out. Initially, the paper used sketches supplied by one of the soldiers on campaign, Colonel Baigrie, but as his pictures were most landscapes, the paper felt that Simpson could add more life to the accounts of the war. The artist arrived at Suez on 18 June 1868, but by the time he neared the front, news came that Magdala had fallen to the Anglo- Indian force. Nonetheless, he was able to observe the retreat of the Abyssinian army, and the remains of the royal quarters of Emperor Theodore at Magdala. He arrived back at Dover on 2 July 1868 and the Illustrated London News published a special folio volume on the Abyssinian Campaign containing many of Simpson's and Baigrie's drawings. Franco-Prussian War and The Commune thumb In 1870, he went to France to sketch the war with Prussia. On 25 July 1870, Simpson headed for the front by going from Nancy to Metz. In Metz, several journalists had already been arrested on suspicion of spying, and Simpson had to be very careful while making his sketches. He had to be creative in getting his sketches to London, and began using cigarette papers. As he said: \\"One could do a great deal on a book of that kind, and in the event of being apprehended, could make a cigarette of the sketch and smoke it before the eyes of one's accusers.\\" In early August, he observed the arrival of the wounded after the battle of Forbach. Later while sketching a coach, he was surrounded by soldier and arrested on suspicion of being a spy but he finally convinced the French authorities that he was a 'special artist'. At the police station, his sketches were carefully examined, and he was finally released. Upon news of the surrender at Sedan, Simpson traveled to sketch the battlefield from the windows of a nearby chateau. In November 1870, he returned to London but was back in France in April 1871 to observe the events around Paris, where he was once again suspected of spying but was allowed to go free. On 27 April, he visited Paris and spent four weeks there, sketching the fortifications and the events of the Commune. He was safely back in London, by 11 June 1871. In 1872 in Beijing he sketched the Chinese Emperor's wedding festivities. In 1873, during a trip around the world, Simpson just happened to be in San Francisco when, on 11 April, Captain Jack and his Modoc henchmen murdered Brigadier-General Edward Canby and Methodist minister Eleazar Thomas at a peace parley. Accordingly, Simpson immediately interrupted his world tour and journeyed up to Tule Lake and the lava beds at the California/Oregon border to make sketches of the Modoc War. His sketch of the Canby/Thomas assassination scene is, today, the signature graphic representation of the 1873 Modoc Indian War in Northern California and Southern Oregon. In 1874, he was elected an Associate of the (soon to be Royal) Institute of Painters in Water Colours. In 1875, he accompanied the Prince of Wales to India, and in 1877, visited Athens, Mycenae and Troy, with the excavations of Schliemann. Afghan War On 15 October 1878, Simpson left London en route to Afghanistan to provide illustrations of the Afghan war that had broken out. Traveling via Lahore and Peshawar, he passed through the Khyber Pass and witnessed the 'first shot' fired at Ali Masjid. He became friendly with Sir Louis Cavagnari and the latter encouraged Simpson with his explorations of ancient Buddhist stupas in and around the Jalalabad Valley. While the Peshawar Valley Field Force was encamped at Jalalabad and later Gandamak, Simpson was allowed to have some soldiers to help him excavate Ahin Posh Tope and several other sites. On one occasion, he was shot at by an Afghan but the bullet just missed. At Gandamak, he met the photographer John Burke and his counterpart at The Graphic, Frederic Villiers, and after the departure of Archibald Forbes, Simpson took over the task of supplying the Daily News with accounts of the campaign. In May 1879, he observed the signing of a peace treaty at Gandamak which ended the war for the time being. When it was decided to send a mission to Kabul, Simpson applied to go but was turned down. His primary interest in accompanying the mission was to visit the giant Buddhas at Bamyan, but had he gone to Kabul, he probably would have been killed liked the rest of the mission. It was this event which precipitated the second part of the war including the disaster at Maiwand. Simpson returned to London in the summer of 1879. Upon his arrival, he visited the offices of the Illustrated London News on the Strand and collected all his sketches and water-colors which he proceeded to mount in two large albums. He also presented several papers to various learned societies on such aspects as Buddhist prayer wheels, sculptured topes and ancient remains in the Jalalabad Valley. In the same year he was elected a full member of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours. The Petroleum Oil Wells at Baku, on the Caspian Throughout the following decade, Simpson continued his travels on behalf of his newspaper covering such events as royal weddings and coronations. In 1890, he observed the opening of the Forth Bridge and caught a chill which was to have detrimental effects on his health. Family and death Simpson married late in life to Maria Eliza Burt herself a portrait painter, and had one daughter, Ann Penelope born in 1884, who eventually emigrated to Australia. He died at home in Willesden, North London, on 17 August 1899, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. Besides his war pictures, he covered state events, coronations, funerals, and other ceremonies. He was particularly interested in India and sketched scenes of the Kashmir Maharajas. He was a noted ethnographer and antiquarian, and wrote extensively on ancient religions, customs, and ancient artifacts. It is said that the Queen intervened to prevent him from going out to Italy in 1859, to cover the Austro-Sardinian War, for fear that he would get killed.

As the liner notes by Barry Alfonso explain: > Of course, folk as a genre had never gone away, just slipped out of the > limelight.

David Shore won an Emmy in 2005 for Outstanding Writing for A Drama Series for this episode. It won the Humanitas Prize in the '60 minute' category for the year 2006. Plot House begrudgingly agrees to fill in for a sick professor and give a lecture on diagnostics to a class of medical students. On his way to the lecture, he encounters Stacy Warner, his ex-girlfriend whom he has not seen in five years. Stacy asks him to examine her husband Mark, but he looks at his file and tells her that Mark doesn‚Äôt appear to be sick. At the lecture, House presents three cases of patients with leg pain to the students. The three stories are intercut with each other; the following summary presents each case in chronological order. The first patient is a farmer who appears to have been bitten by a snake. Foreman and Chase visit the man‚Äôs farm and find a timber rattlesnake. However, the farmer suffers an allergic reaction to the anti- venom and a test of the snake‚Äôs venom sac indicates that it did not recently bite anyone. The patient continues to decline, and when House informs him he is dying, he asks what will happen to his dog. House then realizes that the farmer was bitten by his dog, and bacteria from its mouth caused necrotizing fasciitis. The dog is euthanized and the farmer‚Äôs leg is amputated, but he survives. The second patient is a teenage girl who collapsed at volleyball practice. Cameron takes an excessively detailed medical history and puts her through several invasive and painful tests, only to discover a thyroid condition causing a depressed mental state and tendinitis. The patient does not improve after thyroxine treatment and suddenly develops hypersensitivity to touch. An MRI reveals a tumor in her leg, and Cameron warns the patient that the surgeon may have to amputate her leg to remove the tumor. In the end, the tumor is removed without amputation and she fully recovers. House initially presents the third case as Carmen Electra complaining of leg pain after a round of miniature golf. The patient is in reality a middle-aged man with extreme leg pain; the doctors initially write him off as a drug-seeker. House catheterizes the patient and discovers his urine is tea-colored, indicating both blood and waste in the urine. The medical students do not know the differential diagnosis for waste in urine. House‚Äôs team is by this point observing the lecture, and Cameron suggests muscle death‚Äî myoglobin released by dying muscle shuts down the kidneys. House reveals it took three days for doctors to diagnose the patient properly: he had a clotted aneurysm in his leg, leading to infarction. House‚Äôs team realize that the third patient is House himself. Cuddy informs House that the only options are to either amputate his leg or perform a risky bypass surgery (which could either lead to a full recovery or kill him). He opts for the bypass against the advice of both Cuddy and Stacy. The surgery itself goes well, but House is left in extreme pain and goes into cardiac arrest, clinically dying for almost a full minute. Stacy begs House to agree to the amputation, but he refuses again and asks to be put in a medically-induced coma. While he is unconscious, Stacy (as House‚Äôs medical proxy) knowingly acts against his wishes and authorizes a middle course of treatment: surgery to remove the dead muscle in his leg. As a result, House now has a permanent limp and chronic pain. At the end of the lecture, Cuddy arrives and informs House that the lecture has run twenty minutes over. Later that night, House calls Stacy and agrees to treat her husband. Production The episode was written by series creator David Shore and directed by Paris Barclay.Challen, pp. 172-174 As the episode differed from Shore's earlier work, Shore was unsure how the episode would be received, as he stated in an interview with Canadian Jewish News, \\"it was either the worst thing I had ever written or the best. Honestly I wasn't sure.\\" Shore's narrative device of \\"false flashbacks\\" was largely influenced by the 1968 French science fiction film Je t'aime, je t'aime as well as Alfred Hitchcock's 1949 film Stage Fright. Fans have compared the episode's storytelling to the thriller The Usual Suspects (1995), which was directed by House executive producer Bryan Singer. Reception \\"Three Stories\\" was first broadcast in the United States on Fox on May 17, 2005. The episode was watched by 17.68 million viewers, making House the 14th most-watched program of the week. Shore received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. Shore was \\"shocked\\" when he heard he was nominated. He had been nominated for an Emmy Award twice before, as a producer on Law & Order, but felt this nomination was more personal and individual. Shore won the Emmy Award, and also received the 2006 Humanitas Prize in the 60 Minute Category. \\"Three Stories\\" is also responsible for the show's Peabody Award win in 2005. Barclay was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award, but lost to Michael Apted, who had directed the Rome episode \\"The Stolen Eagle\\". Critics reacted positively to the episode. Matt Zoller Seitz placed the episode second on his list of 2005's best individual television episodes, calling it a \\"high- point\\" for the show. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised the episode for its \\"twisty, smart and moving storytelling\\". In 2009, TV Guide ranked \\"Three Stories\\" #66 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.

Its headwaters are Moreno, Sixmile, and Cieneguilla creeks in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which feed into Eagle Nest Dam. From the dam, it runs for to below the city of Springer, New Mexico in the Taylor Springs area, where it flows into the Canadian River, the southwesternmost major tributary flowing into the Mississippi River via the Arkansas River sub- basin. This river flows within a mountainous canyon that is part of Cimarron Canyon State Park in the lower Sangre de Cristo Mountains and runs down into eastern plains of New Mexico. This headwaters region is also home to the Philmont Scout Ranch. Etymology Cimarron was first applied to either the river or mountains in northeastern New Mexico and applied to other places in the state. The most common belief is that it was named for the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, called carnero cimarrn√≥ in New Mexican Spanish. In addition, cimarr√≥nes was the name for cattle and wild horses. Another of several theories is that is named for the plant rosa cimarr√≥na, a wild rose plant that grows along the river. However, in 1719, it was called La Flecha which means \\"the arrow\\", and may refer to the pass, Palo Flechado. Irrigation The Cimarron River is primarily used to convey runoff water from the Moreno Valley, to local farmers and ranchers downstream who have water rights from Eagle Nest Lake. There are several diversion points along the river in which water is moved into canals and ditches. The three major irrigation districts are Springer Ditch Company, Antelope valley irrigation district, and Vermejo Conservancy District. Some irrigation water travels 50 miles downstream to locations where it is to be used. Climate  Recreation and wildlife  =State park= Mountain valley at Cimarron Canyon State Park. Cimarron Canyon State Park, located along the river, offers equestrian and hiking trails, fly-fishing, and camping. Located within the Colin Neblett Wildlife Management Area, it is near Angel Fire, New Mexico on the Enchanted Circle Scenic Byway. =Fishing= The first dozen miles of the Cimarron River (from Eagle Nest Lake to Ute Park, New Mexico) are known for fine trout fishing. Stocked trout include rainbow and brown. The river is maintained by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish at a trout density of approximately 3,000 fish per mile, although water flow can vary between 2 and 50 cubic feet per second. Ed Adams. Retrieved July 28, 2013. =Wildlife= The most common wildlife to frequent the region include deer, beavers, mice, squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks, and swallows.

She directed Children of the Secret State about North Korea and was an anchor for BBC World News. After leaving BBC World, she directed Dying for the President\\" about Chechnya, Lifting the Veil, about women in Afghanistan, Iran Undercover (Forbidden Iran for PBS Frontline World) and My Friend the Mercenary about the coup in Equatorial Guinea. Her feature, Screamers, was theatrically released in the U.S. in December 2006 and early 2007, and was on Newsweek's pick of non-fiction films for 2006/7. The Independent called it \\"powerful\\" and Larry King for CNN described it as \\"a brilliant film. Everyone should see it.\\" The New York Times deemed it \\"invigorating and articulate,\\" while the Los Angeles Times called it \\"eye- opening.\\" \\"Carla Garapedian is a screamer, too,\\" said the Washington Post.  Early career  She earned her undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science before working as a producer, director and foreign correspondent based in Britain. Between 1987 and 1990, she was a producer/director and reporter for over 75 editions of The World This Week (Channel 4, UK). Her first documentary, Cooking the Books (1989, Channel 4 Dispatches), was a controversial investigation of the Thatcher government's alleged manipulation of official statistics. Between 1991 and 1992 she went in front of the camera, to become the London correspondent for NBC London Live, producing twice-weekly live spots for NBC Newschannel and NBC affiliate, KCRA. From 1991, she also worked for the BBC, producing and directed documentaries for the BBC's long- form foreign affairs documentary series, Assignment. Films included Europe's Nuclear Nightmare (1991), an investigation of East Europe's most dangerous nuclear reactors, post-Chernobyl; A Short Break in the Interference (1993), with Donald Woods, examining radical changes in South African broadcasting; and Aliens Go Home (1994) unraveling the immigration backlash in California following the 1994 earthquake. She was CNBC's London anchor and correspondent in 1995-1996, and in the same period reported for NBC Weekend Nightly News and NBC Today News.  BBC World  The first American to anchor BBC World News, Garapedian presented news and analysis for the main news programs and bulletins between 1996 and 1998. In her later screenplay, Talkback, she dramatizes the night Princess Diana died. Her experiences are also humorously recalled in a 2002 Los Angeles Times article.  Dispatches, Channel 4 (UK)  With the advent of smaller digital cameras, Garapedian began making documentaries in areas usually out of reach to journalists. Working with Hardcash production company, she produced and directed films for Channel 4's investigative series, Dispatches. Her films, all using undercover filming, included Dying for the President (Chechnya), Children of the Secret State (North Korea), Lifting the Veil (Afghanistan), Iran Undercover (Iran) and My Friend the Mercenary (South Africa/Equatorial Guinea). A description of this work is partly described in The Los Angeles Times article, \\"Documenting Truth in Dangerous Places.\\"  Lifting the Veil  Lifting the Veil is a 50-minute documentary that was funded by Channel Four in the UK. The filmmaker traveled to Afghanistan to investigate the public murder of Zarmina, an Islamic mother of seven. Her abusive husband was going to tell the Taliban that she had committed adultery, a crime punishable by death. She killed him in self- defense and was sent to prison. Her seven children, all under the age of 15, were persuaded by the Taliban to find their mother guilty. Garapedian searched out the children, who provide commentary. Lifting the Veil was originally broadcast on British television in 2002, and later broadcast on the U.S. Sundance Channel.  Screamers  Screamers was a documentary feature film released in December 2006.\\"IMDB: SCREAMERS\\" This film features the band System of a Down and depicts genocides of the past century, with a focus on the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923. Also mentioned are the Jewish Holocaust, the Bosnian Genocide, the Rwandan genocide, and the genocide of the Darfur region. The movie examines the problem of why genocides repeat, with contributions from Pulitzer prize-winning author Professor Samantha Power (A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide), currently the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. The film consists of a tour with System of a Down interspersed with various scenes of genocides in the twentieth century.\\"Huffington Post: Carla Garapedian\\" The film premiered at the AFI Film festival in November 2006, where it shared the Audience Award for Best Documentary. After the film's release, one of the contributors in the film, Hrant Dink, an editor for Agos Newspaper, was murdered in Istanbul, Turkey. In addition to its theatrical release in the United States, Screamers has been translated into 13 languagesArmenian, Arabic, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and shown in political venues like the U.S. Congress, British Parliament, European Parliament, Canadian Parliament and United Nations (UNHCR).\\"Screamers Official site\\" The film was officially selected for festivals around the world, including the Warsaw International Film Festival, Hamburg International Film Festival, S√£o Paulo Mostra International Film Festival, Reykavik Film Festival, Montreal Human Rights festival, Amnesty International Film Festival in Vancouver, Flanders International Film Festival, MOFFAM festival in Prague, Encounters festival in Johannesburg and Cape Town, and the Golden Apricot International Film Festival in Yerevan. On April 24, 2007, when Screamers was screened in the British Parliament, the Chairman of the Genocide Prevention Committee, John Bercow MP (current Speaker of the House), made the following statement: \\"Timed to coincide with the 92nd anniversary of the horrific Armenian genocide, this harrowing film is the most powerful reminder that the evil of genocide is sadly not a thing of the past but has remained a recurrent feature in our world to the present day, from Armenia to the Holocaust, from Srebreni√ßa to Rwanda, and now to Darfur. Bestial slaughter of whole peoples continues to blight humanity, shaming and diminishing us all. By pitching the film to young people who often will know nothing of earlier horrors, Carla is encouraging a new generation to treat the business of murder as their business to stop, through campaigning, protest and pressure.\\" In 2015, Screamers screened in Berlin, Minsk, and Moscow for the 100th commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. It was also shown in Turkey for the first time, sponsored by the Documentarist film festival, which features banned and censored films.  Weimar-era Feature Film  At the 2008 Hamburg International Film Festival, Garapedian was asked by a member of the audience about the lessons Germany may have learned from the Armenian genocide. She replied that she was fascinated with the inter-war period of German politics and, in particular, with a murder trial that occurred in Berlin in 1921. This trial was touched on by Samantha Power in Screamers, referring to \\"A Crime with No Name,\\" the first chapter of Power's book, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide. Garapedian said that she believed this trial foreshadowed the Holocaust. She confirmed in October 2015, during her discussion at the Hammer Museum with Eric Bogosian, author of Operation Nemesis, that she is making a feature film about the trial which has been the subject of a number of books.  Awards  Garapedian has received numerous awards for her piercing documentaries. Her first documentary, \\"Cooking the Books\\" for Dispatches (Channel 4, UK, 1989), was nominated for a Royal Television Society award. She is the recipient of the Armin T. Wegner Humanitarian Award (Armin T. Wegner Society), and the Clara Barton Medal (National Academy of Sciences, Armenian Genocide Museum Institute). Germany and the Secret Genocide, a film she co-wrote with J. Michael Hagopian, won the Gold Camera for History in the U.S. International Film and Video Festival in 2004. In 2006 \\"Screamers,\\" co-created and co- produced with Peter McAlevey, shared the American Film Institute Audience Award for Best Documentary. It won the Audience award at the Montreal Human Rights festival, and the Golden Apricot and Ecumenical Jury Award in Yerevan in 2007. On February 27, 2009, AGBU honored Garapedian with GenNext's \\"Community Hero award.\\" Garapedian accepted the award for her film Screamers, the critically acclaimed documentary about System of a Down's efforts to raise Armenian Genocide awareness in the minds of mainstream audiences. During her acceptance speech, Garapedian said: After Screamers, she started to speak about genocide prevention and human rights to university audiences. At the Claremont McKenna Atheneum series, in 2013, she spoke about \\"Truth, Denial and the Armenian Genocide. She was the keynote speaker at the 2010 official commemoration of the Armenian genocide at the Massachusetts State Parliament, and the moderator of the I am Armenian film series at the Hammer Museum in 2015. Carla Garapedian is one of the individuals recognized in 100 Lives an initiative that aims to \\"show gratitude through action.\\" On April 24, 2016, along with George Clooney, the organization will launch the Aurora Prize, supporting humanitarian projects around the world.  Armenian Film Foundation  Leo Garapedian, her father, was a journalism professor and co-founder of the Armenian Film Foundation. This organization supported the late filmmaker, J. Michael Hagopian, and his 40-year quest to record, on 16mm film, Armenian Genocide survivors around the world. Carla Garapedian narrated Hagopian's film, Voices from the Lake, and The River Ran Red, as well as co-writing Hagopian's film, Germany and the Secret Genocide. After Hagopian's death, she became the project leader of the Armenian Film Foundation's Armenian Genocide Testimonies collection, which digitized approximately 400 interviews of Armenian genocide survivors (filmed by J. Michael Hagopian) for the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive. The Shoah Foundation, founded by filmmaker Steven Spielberg, created the Visual History Archive, to make available 52,000 Holocaust testimonies for research and education. The Visual History Archive has now added testimonies from other genocides, including the Armenian Genocide. Garapedian continues to work with the Armenian Film Foundation, one of the preeminent centers for visual images of Armenian history and culture.  Pomegranate Foundation  She founded the Pomegranate Foundation in 2009 to raise awareness, through the arts, about genocide and intolerance. A rare library of Rwanda genocide survivor testimonies, filmed by Professor Donald E. Miller and Lorna Tourian Miller, was added to the foundation's collection in 2015.

It was founded in May 1951 and currently maintains 140 member organisations from 129 countries on six continents.  History  The International Federation of Medical Students' Associations was one of the numerous international student organizations set up directly after the end of the Second World War. The first meeting that saw the establishment of the Federation was held in Copenhagen, Denmark in May 1951. The first members of this new organization were England, Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Denmark. London saw the first General Assembly of IFMSA in July 1952. The meeting had a total of thirty participants from ten countries. Starting from the exclusively European founding organizations the Federation has expanded to include 136 members from all over the world. IFMSA has always focused on student mobility and exchange as well as conference and workshop organization. The first conferences were the Student International Clinical Conferences, which were quite successful in the 1950s. Various summer schools have been organized through the years, starting in 1963 in Denmark, the UK and Scandinavia. Other conferences have discussed medical education, drugs and AIDS and HIV issues. In the 1960s projects were organized to help less advantaged students in developing countries the Book Aid project, which sought to send medical books from wealthier nations and the Equipment Appeal, which promoted the shipping of surplus medical equipment to these countries. The 1970s medical students saw a need for the decentralization of IFMSA. To this aim, IFMSA contributed to the creation of regional medical student organizations in Africa and Asia. Subsequently, regional vice-presidents were elected for six regions as a way of promoting regionalization but this structure was abandoned after a few years. In the early 1980s IFMSA issued a number of resolutions and declarations on topics ranging from Medical Education to the Prevention of Nuclear War to Primary Health Care. In the late 80's there was a push towards organizing projects that would be able to make a change locally and thus the Village Concept Project idea was born after collaboration with other international student organizations. 1986 also saw the start of the Leadership Training Programs in collaboration with World Health Organization. These training programs are still active today. Official relations with WHO started back in 1969, when the collaboration resulted in the organization of a symposium on \\"Programmed Learning in Medical Education\\", as well as immunology and tropical medicine programs. In the following years, IFMSA and WHO collaborated in the organization of a number of workshops and training programs. IFMSA has been collaborating with UNESCO since 1971. Since 2007 IFMSA has been an official supporting organization of HIFA2015 (Healthcare Information For All by 2015).  Activities  The main activities of IFMSA are student exchanges and different projects. Around 14 000 medical students each year participate in international medical student exchanges, both professional and academic (research). IFMSA organizes projects, programs, seminars and workshops on areas of public health, medical education, reproductive health and human rights and peace.  Organization  All activities of the IFMSA are linked to one of its six standing committees, which are: * Standing Committee on Medical Education (SCOME) * Standing Committee on Professional Exchange (SCOPE) * Standing Committee on Research Exchange (SCORE) * Standing Committee on Public Health (SCOPH) * Standing Committee on Sexual & Reproductive Health and Rights including HIV & AIDS (SCORA) * Standing Committee on Human Rights and Peace (SCORP)  Structure  To be able to work together, IFMSA has created an organizational structure, which facilitates the flow of ideas and enables the development of activities. IFMSA is composed of medical students' associations from 126 different countries, from which are formed 136 members of IFMSA and are called National Member Organizations (NMOs). All the activities of IFMSA are organized by the NMO's. Each NMO has its own identity. Most NMOs have Local Committees at the medical schools in their country. The Local Committees coordinate and organize IFMSA activities. Through these Local Committees the NMO's are in direct contact with the medical students. IFMSA is a federation, which respects the autonomy of its members, the NMO's. The NMO's can decide which activities they take part in and what new activities should be developed. IFMSA functions as an umbrella organization with 140 national and local organisations in 129 countries. The decision making process is in the hands of the General Assembly, the executive process is in the hands of the International Board and the controlling power is in the hands of the Supervising Council. The General Assembly (GA) is composed of representatives of all NMO's, and meets twice a year in March and August. The General Assembly decides the activities of IFMSA, the regulations, and the management and elects the Team of Officials and the Supervising Council. The General Assembly elects the Team of Officials (TO) each year. It is composed of the Executive Board (EB), Standing Committee Directors, Liaison Officers and Regional Directors. The Executive Board is responsible for the daily management of the Federation and deals with issues such as fundraising, marketing, external relations, finances, administration, development and support to National Member Organisations. Standing Committee Directors are assigned to one field of activities. They coordinate the Standing Committee, which carries out these activities. They give support to national and local officers, prepare the meetings of the Standing Committee and are responsible for development of new activities. Liaison Officers maintain the contacts with important external relations and represent IFMSA towards those organizations. The Regional Directors are responsible of each of the IFMSA 5 Regions. The Supervising Council is elected by the General Assembly to evaluate and supervise the work of the IFMSA officials and undertakes actions in case problems arise.

The March Meeting and the August Meeting bring together several hundred (600‚Äì900) medical students from all around the world. During the seven days of the meetings, the delegates discuss matters of the Federation and make valuable contacts for their organizations. The General Assembly remains the highest decision making body of the Federation although the actual program of the meeting has developed into a mixture of training, planning and evaluation sessions in between the legislative Plenary Sessions. The work in the Standing Committees of IFMSA is the essence for most delegates: signing contracts, presenting and planning projects are all in a day's work for the National Officers from the participating organizations. An extensive Training and Resource Development component has been integrated in the program, providing the participants with new skills needed in their work, but seldom found in the regular University curriculum: Lobbying Skills, Group Dynamics and Strategic Planning to name a few. With IFMSA being much more than just exchanges, the Project Fair has evolved to extend presentations of local, national and international projects outside the Standing Committees. Round Table Discussions enable the student delegates to discuss currently relevant topics with invited experts and short lectures are frequently given by representatives from, for example, different UN agencies. A special Financial Committee is elected at each General Assembly to audit the budget and finances of the Federation. Other legislative proceedings at the meetings include adoption of reports from the Executive Board members, IFMSA Officials and IFMSA projects, and adoption of official IFMSA Policy Statements. Guidelines on which areas IFMSA should focus on and other important decisions for the future of the Federation are prepared by the Presidents of the National Member Organizations together with the Executive Board and brought for approval to the Plenary Sessions. Hosting a General Assembly is an honor, but also a great trial for the Organizing Committee. The entire process is run by voluntary students, from the fundraising to the implementation, and shows that the power of IFMSA indeed lies at the local level. As with any international meeting, the social program is important in providing relaxation between the long hours of work, and giving the hosts an opportunity to show their culture and creativity to their foreign friends. =Regional and sub-regional meetings= In addition to the General Assemblies, the National Member Organizations are also getting together for Regional Meetings. These meetings follow a similar agenda as General Assemblies, and are organized yearly for each region. They allow more students of the Region to gather, because the meeting is always in the Region, and the agenda is focused on regionally relevant topics.  Awards  The IFMSA won on 3 October 2014 the Health Systems Award - Civil Organization. This award recognizes the organization that best employs social media to engage civil society in health systems-related dialogue. It recognizes the work the Federation has been doing all around the world to connect and engage with health communities around the world so to shape the sustainable and healthy future we want.

In his will he decreed that the majority of his estate be disposed of by 1916 for the benefit of various public institutions and causes. The trustees decided to establish the Massey Foundation. The trustees were family members, including Hart's son Chester and Chester's son, Vincent. In 1918, the foundation was incorporated. The Massey Foundation was designed to create new projects. One of the first projects supported was the Massey Memorial Pipe Organ (completed in 1907 with Massey estate funds and named for Hart Massey) which is located in Chautauqua Institution and the completion of Hart House, which was started in 1911 with Massey estate funds and also named after Hart Massey. It also funded the construction of the Hart House Theatre. In 1933, the foundation undertook the renovation of Massey Hall. In 1962, it built and endowed Massey College at the University of Toronto.

Initially set to release their debut EP Weed Bus on local independent label Imaginary Records (for which a handful of white labels with unique picture sleeves were pressed up), the band ended up signing to Go! Discs, home to The La's and Paul Weller with whom they would issue cult album Mexican R'n'B (1992) along with 3 EPs, all recorded in mono as a nod to their garage rock influenced sound. The band's manager Jason Otty, although not a proper member of the band, would often play harmonica and appear in press shots. The band would also release an EP featuring the Del-Vetts cover \\"Last Time Around\\" and provide a cover version of the Captain Beefheart version of the David Gates penned \\"Moonchild\\" for a compilation for Imaginary Records to make up for not releasing the Weed Bus EP with them.

The theory is that across cultures and linguistic groups there are five sounds, each with a meaning, that are used by infants before the language acquisition period. The hypothesis was developed by Australian former mezzo- soprano, Priscilla Dunstan, and has been featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show.Dunstan on The Oprah Winfrey Show Dunstan's theory has not been scientifically validated. Dunstan's theory Between 0‚Äì3 months, infants make what Dunstan calls sound reflexes. According to Dunstan, we all have reflexes, like sneezes, hiccups, and burps, that all have a recognizable pattern when sound is added to the reflex. There are other reflexes that all babies experience, and when sound is added to these, a distinct, preemptive \\"cry\\" will occur before the infant breaks into what Dunstan calls the hysterical cry. Dunstan states that these preemptive cries can indicate what the infant requires (e.g., food, comfort, sleep, etc.), and they escalate to the hysterical cry if they are not answered. As the infant matures past 3 months in vocalization, the sound reflexes become replaced with more elaborate babbling. =Words (sound reflexes)= According to Dunstan, the five universal words (or sound reflexes) used by infants are:Five Universal Words of Dunstan Baby Language as Posted on Oprah.com * Neh (I am hungry) - An infant uses the sound reflex \\"Neh\\" to communicate its hunger. The sound is produced when the sucking reflex is triggered, and the tongue is pushed up on the roof of the mouth. * Owh (I'm sleepy) - An infant uses the sound reflex \\"Owh\\" to communicate that they are tired. The sound is produced much like an audible yawn. * Heh (I'm experiencing discomfort) - An infant uses the sound reflex \\"Heh\\" to communicate stress, discomfort, or perhaps that it needs a fresh diaper. The sound is produced by a response to a skin reflex, such as feeling sweat or itchiness in the bum. * Eairh (I have lower gas) - An infant uses the sound reflex \\"Eairh\\" to communicate they have flatulence or an upset stomach. The sound is produced when trapped air from a belch is unable to release and travels to the stomach where the muscles of the intestines tighten to force the air bubble out. Often, this sound will indicate that a bowel movement is in progress, and the infant will bend its knees, bringing the legs toward the torso. This leg movement assists in the ongoing process. * Eh (I need to be burped) - An infant uses the sound reflex \\"Eh\\" to communicate that it needs to be burped. The sound is produced when a large bubble of trapped air is caught in the chest, and the reflex is trying to release this out of the mouth. Dunstan states that she has a photographic memory for sounds and that this, combined with her years in the opera and her experience as a mother, allowed her to recognize certain sounds in the human voice. A DVD set called The Dunstan Baby Language was released by Dunstan in November 2006. The two-disc set covered the five universal words of the language, methods of learning how to recognize the vocalizations and sounds, numerous examples of baby cries from around the world to \\"tune your ear,\\" and live demonstrations of newborn mother groups experimenting with the language. Criticism Linguistics experts point out that Dunstan's hypothesis has not been subjected to rigorous testing or academic scrutiny. The Dunstan company had, at one time, developed a clinical trial plan with Brown University researchers to test its claims, but abandoned it for consumer surveys and small-group observations in order \\"to hasten the development of a system that could be used by parents,\\" skipping rigorous testing to go straight to market.\\"Dare I Trust My Intuition?\\", Mary Carmichael, Newsweek, 31 January 2009 See also * Elimination communication * Baby talk * Fis phenomenon * Baby sign language * Confirmation bias References External links * Dunstan Baby Language Website * Dunstan Baby Language Website - French Version * Dunstan Baby Language on Oprah.com * News from Language Log Labs * Baby Language Information ;Video links * Dunstan Baby Language * Dunstan Baby Language on CTV News Category:Language acquisition Category:Infancy Category:Child development Category:Pseudoscience Category:Pseudolinguistics ","title":"Dunstan Baby Language"},{"id":"7962270","text":"Bishop Ryan Catholic School is a PK‚Äì12 private, Roman Catholic, co-educational school in Minot, North Dakota, United States.

America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a mechanical articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees). History The spherical rod end bearing was developed by Nazi Germany during World War II.History of the Heim Joint - AKA Rod End Bearing When one of the first German planes to be shot down by the British in early 1940 was examined, they found this joint in use in the aircraft's control systems. Following this discovery, the Allied governments gave the H.G. Heim Company an exclusive patent to manufacture these joints in North America, while in the UK the patent passed to Rose Bearings Ltd.Howard, K. 1999. Technofile: The rod end bearing. Motor Sport. LXXV/8 (August 1999), 70-71 The ubiquity of these manufacturers in their respective markets led to the terms heim joint and rose joint becoming synonymous with their product. After the patents ran out the common names stuck, although \\"rosejoint\\" remains a registered trademark of Minebea Mitsumi Inc., successor to Rose Bearings Ltd. Originally used in aircraft, the rod end bearing may be found in cars, trucks, race cars, motorcycles, lawn tractors, boats, industrial machines, go-karts, radio- control helicopters, formula cars, and many more applications.  Female Heim Joint  Female Heim Joint Using female heim joints will allow users to make precise changes on key components of fixtures. One example of needing fine adjustment is within the helicopter‚Äôs adjustment of the blades. When using the adjustment, it is key to make sure it is in the correct spot or excessive wear will occur. This change allows quick adjustments that are easy with a female heim joint. When dealing with the pitch of a helicopter blades, heim joints are able to be adjusted to 0.010in. If spacing is critical, female heim joints are able to be threaded on, instead of welding inserts to the shaft. When dealing with aluminium shafts, the easiest way to use heim joints is to use the female heim joint. One example is using robots in robotics competitions. Light weight is a key factors when building competitive robots, so using aluminum rods and female heim joints can be key. Another example using female heim joints is the shifter of motorcycles. The shifting mechanism allows forces to be applied linear, but still be able to work at angles when in different gears. Both male and female heim joints require the use of a lock nut after getting adjustment to correct specification needed.

At 3,680 feet (1,121 m) in elevation, it is the 20th-highest peak in the Catskill Mountains and considered a member of the Catskill High Peaks. While there is no maintained trail, a bushwhack to the summit is considered relatively easy, and required for membership in the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club. Geography Rusk is the highest peak (and the only High Peak) on what Catskill forest historian Michael Kudish calls the Lexington Range, the northern of two that fork off from nearby Hunter Mountain, the second-highest Catskill peak. Between Rusk and Taylor Hollow, the col between it and Hunter to its east, there is an unnamed 3,640-foot (1,109 m) summit referred to as East Rusk. The range continues to Evergreen and Packsaddle mountains to the west before ending at Lexington. The mountain is within the Schoharie Creek watershed. Its southern slopes are drained by an unnamed brook that flows down Ox Hollow into Hunter Brook just above where that stream joins the West Kill, which later drains into the Schoharie. The northern slopes drain directly into the Schoharie headwaters just below them. Its runoff helps feed Schoharie Reservoir, part of the New York City water supply system. While Rusk is dwarfed from the perspective of the Spruceton Valley by 3,880-foot (1,183 m) West Kill Mountain, it is more impressive due to a greater rise from the valley floor. The north face can be glimpsed in its entirety from NY 296 just north of its junction with NY 23A. That slope rises up steadily and steeply to the summit ridge. The south is marked by Ox Hollow, and the ridge to its south that is the most frequently used approach when climbing the mountain. The summit ridge leads out to a promontory to the south at the head of the ridge. Much of the mountain is owned by the state of New York, part of its Forest Preserve, and included in what is currently the Hunter Mountain Wild Forest unit of the Catskill Park. A proposed change, however, would upgrade the lands on Rusk and most of its neighboring peaks into a new unit to be called the Hunter-West Kill wilderness area, while preserving a corridor going up Hunter as the Rusk Mountain Wild Forest (although Rusk would not be a part of that). The only large private landholding on the slopes is to the southwest. History Rusk was named by Arnold Henri Guyot after Samuel Rusk, who assisted the Princeton geology professor on what would be the first accurate survey of the Catskills in the 1870s and '80s. There is some evidence, however, that Guyot meant to name what is today East Rusk after Rusk and save Evergreen for today's Rusk, but got confused with his maps. Guyot made probably what is the first recorded ascent of the mountain during his survey, but it is unknown whether anyone else had come first. Natural history According to Kudish, Rusk boasts, in the upper reaches of Ox Hollow, one of the few virgin stands of Eastern Hemlock he has so far identified in the Catskills. This suggests that the barkpeelers of the late 19th century, who deforested large tracts of the region looking for tannin, never got up to this area. The peak was, however, definitely well- explored by the local lumber industry, as skid and wood roads can be found in the woods today, some well above 3,000 feet (900 m) in elevation. The forest below that elevation is thus dominated by the beech and maple trees that are common second-growth in the Catskills. Above those elevations, those trees persist, albeit in smaller and more stunted forms as elevation increases, until finally they share the summit ridge with the red spruce and balsam fir of the boreal forest found on Catskill summits. Rusk's, however, is more open and passable than some of its neighbors. Approaches Land ownership and existing roads in the area have long favored the popular southern approach up the ridge leading up to the summit from Ox Hollow, although easier approaches are theoretically possible. Altogether, there are four routes up the mountain. =Ox Hollow= Hikers taking this route park at the Spruceton trailhead along Spruceton Road (Greene County Route 7) six miles (9.6 km) east of NY 42 at West Kill. They follow the Spruceton Trail, the old road to the fire tower on Hunter, for roughly 0.5 mile (900 m) until it makes a sharp curve shortly after crossing Hunter Brook. At that point, an old wood road can be seen intersecting from the southwest. This is followed, making for easy crossings of Hunter's unnamed tributary and the intermittent Ox Hollow drainage brook. A short distance afterward it is at the center of the ridge. From this point, it is very easy to follow the wide ridge's line straight up to the promontory. A stone wall left over from past attempts to farm this land runs nearly parallel to the route at first, and then it is necessary to either cut across a corner of private property or drop slightly down into the Ox Hollow side to remain on public land. Most hikers choose the former. The woods here remain fairly open, although stinging nettles flourish here in wetter summers. Above approximately 3,200 feet (975 m), after the last wood road has been crossed and the land belongs to the state once again, the climb becomes more difficult. Not only does the slope becomes steeper and rockier, immature seedlings become denser in the forest understory, making it necessary to gently shove them away and duck underneath or step around them. Hikers who reach the 3,500-foot (1,067 m) cutoff elevation for High Peak status will find themselves at the base of the shale cliffs around the promontory. This is the crux of the Ox Hollow route. While they are not very sheer and present a number of safe routes to a climber willing to use his or her hands, it can take some time to find one and reach the top. A comparatively easy traverse through the cliffs exists, but is not immediately evident, especially in warmer weather when vegetation limits the view. Once atop the promontory, the ground is level. Climbers who turn due north at this point, towards the obvious higher ground, invariably find the herd path that leads toward the 3500 Club summit canister. At the point where it climbs up onto the summit cap, there is in all seasons of year an excellent view east and southeast toward Kaaterskill High Peak, Hunter and Southwest Hunter. Next to the top of the short scramble, there is a somewhat limited view across the valley to West Kill's summit nunatak. Total vertical gain via this route is 1,597 feet (487 m). Approximate distance to the summit from Spruceton Road is 2 miles (3.2 km) Drainage variant A small number of hikers prefer to follow the creek at the bottom of Ox Hollow instead of the ridge and climb the hollow's steep headwall to the summit or the connecting ridge to East Rusk. This requires more effort later on but avoids the cliffs. =East from Taylor Hollow= When Hunter and Rusk are climbed on the same outing it is common to follow the ridgeline from the Spruceton Trail at Taylor Hollow between the two peaks. This is a gentler rise that also allows for a visit to East Rusk. =Southwest= Since open land, and driveable roads that run off Rusk Mountain Road, climb a good distance up the mountain in this direction it could, if used, provide a relatively easy hike until just before the promontory. However, this land is privately owned and it would be necessary to get permission to cross it. =North face= While this slope is on public land, it is also necessary to get permission to cross private property to reach its base. Some hikers have taken this approach, mainly for variety's sake. Total gain via this route would be 2,180 feet (664 m). There is no herd path in this direction. Some hikers report views to the Blackhead Range exist but are not significantly different or better than the many found in more accessible locations. Summit alt=A snow-covered forested mountain with brushy snow-covered vegetation in the foreground under a blue sky with streaky clouds As with many other Catskill peaks, it is difficult to determine where the true high ground on Rusk is as the top is fairly flat. The herd path from the promontory is fairly strong (though some sections near its start can be almost imperceptible in summer when the surrounding ferns grow waist-high) and gets wider and easier to follow as it gets closer to the canister, located near the northwest corner of the summit. There is ample room for a party of hikers to relax and have lunch around it, as many do. There are few views that equal the viewpoint early on the herd path, though some limited ones to West Kill and its neighbors are available for those who search around in the brush south of the canister, especially if leaves are down. Anecdotal accounts from GPS readouts on the summit suggest that the mountain may be higher than officially reported.

By early 1996 the project was renamed ELKS (Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset), and in 1997 the first website www.elks.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ (offline, ) was created. ELKS version 0.0.63 followed on August 8 that same year. On June 22, 1999, ELKS release 0.0.77 was available, the first version able to run a graphical user interface (the Nano-X Window System). On July 21, ELKS booted on a Psion PDA with SIBO architecture. ELKS 0.0.82 came out on January 10, 2000. By including the SIBO port, it became the first official version running on other computer hardware than the original 8086 base. On March 3 that year, the project was registered on SourceForge, the new website being elks.sourceforge.net. On January 6, 2001, Cox declared ELKS \\"basically dead\\".January 6, 2001, Nonetheless, release 0.0.84 came along on June 17, 2001, Charilaos (Harry) Kalogirou added TCP/IP networking support seven days later, and in the same year ELKS reached 0.0.90 on November 17. On April 20, 2002, Kalogirou added memory management with disk swapping capability, followed nine days later by ELKS release 0.1.0, considered the first beta version. By end of the year, on December 18, the EDE (Elks Distribution Edition, a distribution based on the ELKS kernel), itself version 0.0.5, is released.Announce of the EDE 0.0.5 release January 6, 2003, brought ELKS 0.1.2, an update to 0.1.3 followed on May 3, 2006, the first official release after a long hiatus in development. A development into FlightLinux, a real-time operating system for spacecrafts, once was planned, but the project it was intended for (UoSAT-12) eventually settled on the qCF operating system from Quadron Corporation instead.Linux-8086: Flight Linux Current status and usage Since January 2012 ELKS is again under development. The CVS repository was migrated to Git in February 2012, and numerous patches from the Linux-8086 mailing list were committed to the new repository. Version 0.1.4 came out on February 19, 2012, released by Jody Bruchon in memory of Riley Williams, a former co-developer. It included updated floppy disk images, fixing compilation bugs of the previous version and removing unused codes. On May 10, 2012, BusyELKS was added to the repository by Jody Bruchon in an attempt to replace stand-alone binaries and to take advantage of shared code (ELKS does not support shared libraries). BusyBox-like binaries attempt to save space with symbolic links, eliminating redundant chunks of code, and are combining separate programs into one bigger binary.BusyELKS introduction On November 14, 2013, project development moved to GitHub.Info on ELKS' GitHub move Rudimentary Ethernet and FAT support were added in 2017. More than 30 developers have contributed to this project since the fork in 1995. As of March 2015, development of the ELKS project was again active, reaching a milestone 1,000 source code commits on March 8, 2015. As of June 2018, many bug fixes and improvements were performed with 583 more commits, leading to the 0.2.1 release. In March 2019, the project completed it's transition from the obsolete BCC compiler to the more recent GCC-IA16.

It originated with the realist art movement that began with mid-nineteenth-century French literature (Stendhal), and Russian literature (Alexander Pushkin). Literary realism attempts to represent familiar things as they are. Realist authors chose to depict everyday and banal activities and experiences. Background Broadly defined as \\"the representation of reality\\", realism in the arts is the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, as well as implausible, exotic and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization. In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. Realist works of art may emphasize the ugly or sordid, such as works of social realism, regionalism, or kitchen sink realism. There have been various realism movements in the arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism and Italian neorealist cinema. The realism art movement in painting began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution. The realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century. Realism as a movement in literature was a post-1848 phenomenon, according to its first theorist Jules-Fran√ßais Champfleury. It aims to reproduce \\"objective reality\\", and focused on showing everyday, quotidian activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization. It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person objective reality, without embellishment or interpretation and \\"in accordance with secular, empirical rules.\\"in so far as such subjects are \\"explicable in terms of natural causation without resort to supernatural or divine intervention\\" Morris, 2003. p. 5 As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such reality is ontologically independent of man's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As literary critic Ian Watt states in The Rise of the Novel, modern realism \\"begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses\\" and as such \\"it has its origins in Descartes and Locke, and received its first full formulation by Thomas Reid in the middle of the eighteenth century.\\"Watt, 1957, p.12 In the Introduction to The Human Comedy (1842) Balzac \\"claims that poetic creation and scientific creation are closely related activities, manifesting the tendency of realists towards taking over scientific methods\\". The artists of realism used the achievements of contemporary science, the strictness and precision of the scientific method, in order to understand reality. The positivist spirit in science presupposes feeling contempt towards metaphysics, the cult of the fact, experiment and proof, confidence in science and the progress that it brings, as well as striving to give a scientific form to studying social and moral phenomena.\\" In the late 18th century Romanticism was a revolt against the aristocratic social and political norms of the previous Age of Reason and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature found in the dominant philosophy of the 18th century, as well as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography,David Levin, History as Romantic Art: Bancroft, Prescott, and Parkman (1967) educationGerald Lee Gutek, A history of the Western educational experience (1987) ch. 12 on Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and the natural sciences.Ashton Nichols, \\"Roaring Alligators and Burning Tygers: Poetry and Science from William Bartram to Charles Darwin,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 2005 149(3): 304‚Äì315 19th-century realism was in its turn a reaction to Romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as traditional or \\"bourgeois realism\\". However, not all writers of Victorian literature produced works of realism. The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of Victorian realism prompted in their turn the revolt of modernism. Starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.John Barth (1979) The Literature of Replenishment, later republished in The Friday Book' '(1984).Gerald Graff (1975) Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

Sub-Genre of Literary Realism  =Social Realism= Social Realism is an international art movement that includes the work of painters, printmakers, photographers and filmmakers who draw attention to the everyday conditions of the working classes and the poor, and who are critical of the social structures that maintain these conditions. While the movement's artistic styles vary from nation to nation, it almost always uses a form of descriptive or critical realism. Kitchen sink realism (or kitchen sink drama) is a term coined to describe a British cultural movement that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in theatre, art, novels, film and television plays, which used a style of social realism. Its protagonists usually could be described as angry young men, and it often depicted the domestic situations of working-class Britons living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore social issues and political controversies. The films, plays and novels employing this style are set frequently in poorer industrial areas in the North of England, and use the rough-hewn speaking accents and slang heard in those regions. The film It Always Rains on Sunday (1947) is a precursor of the genre, and the John Osborne play Look Back in Anger (1956) is thought of as the first of the genre. The gritty love-triangle of Look Back in Anger, for example, takes place in a cramped, one-room flat in the English Midlands. The conventions of the genre have continued into the 2000s, finding expression in such television shows as Coronation Street and EastEnders.Heilpern, John. John Osborne: The Many Lives of the Angry Young Man, New York: Knopf, 2007. In art, \\"Kitchen Sink School\\" was a term used by critic David Sylvester to describe painters who depicted social realist‚Äìtype scenes of domestic life.Walker, John. (1992) \\"Kitchen Sink School\\". Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945, 3rd. ed. Retrieved 20 January 2012. =Socialist Realism= Socialist realism is the official Soviet art form that was institutionalized by Joseph Stalin in 1934 and was later adopted by allied Communist parties worldwide. This form of realism held that successful art depicts and glorifies the proletariat's struggle toward socialist progress. The Statute of the Union of Soviet Writers in 1934 stated that socialist realism ::is the basic method of Soviet literature and literary criticism. It demands of the artist the truthful, historically concrete representation of reality in its revolutionary development. Moreover, the truthfulness and historical concreteness of the artistic representation of reality must be linked with the task of ideological transformation and education of workers in the spirit of socialism.On Socialist Realism\\" by Andrei Sinyavsky writing as Abram Tertz , p.148. The strict adherence to the above tenets, however, began to crumble after the death of Stalin when writers started expanding the limits of what is possible. However, the changes were gradual since the social realism tradition was so ingrained into the psyche of the Soviet literati that even dissidents followed the habits of this type of composition, rarely straying from its formal and ideological mold. The Soviet socialist realism did not exactly emerge on the very day it was promulgated in the Soviet Union in 1932 by way of a decree that abolished independent writers' organizations. This movement has been existing for at least fifteen years and was first seen during the Bolshevik Revolution. The 1934 declaration only formalized its canonical formulation through the speeches of the revolutionary Maxim Gorky and Andrea Zhdanov, the representative of the Party's Central Committee. The official definition of social realism has been criticized for its conflicting framework. While the concept itself is simple, discerning scholars struggle in reconciling its elements. According to Peter Kenez, \\"it was impossible to reconcile the teleological requirement with realistic presentation,\\" further stressing that \\"the world could either be depicted as it was or as it should be according to theory, but the two are obviously not the same.\\" =Naturalism= Naturalism was a literary movement or tendency from the 1880s to 1930s that used detailed realism to suggest that social conditions, heredity, and environment had inescapable force in shaping human character. It was a mainly unorganized literary movement that sought to depict believable everyday reality, as opposed to such movements as Romanticism or Surrealism, in which subjects may receive highly symbolic, idealistic or even supernatural treatment. Naturalism was an outgrowth of literary realism, influenced by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.Williams, Raymond. 1976. Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society. London: Fontana, 1988, p. 217. . Whereas realism seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also attempts to determine \\"scientifically\\" the underlying forces (e.g., the environment or heredity) influencing the actions of its subjects. Naturalistic works often include supposed sordid subject matter, for example, √âmile Zola's frank treatment of sexuality, as well as a pervasive pessimism. Naturalistic works tend to focus on the darker aspects of life, including poverty, racism, violence, prejudice, disease, corruption, prostitution, and filth. As a result, naturalistic writers were frequently criticized for focusing too much on human vice and misery.  Realism in the Novel  =Australia= In the early nineteenth century, there was growing impetus to establish an Australian culture that was separate from its English Colonial beginnings. Common artistic motifs and characters that were represented in Australian realism were the Australian Outback, known simply as \\"the bush\\", in its harsh and volatile beauty, the British settlers, the Indigenous Australian, the squatter and the digger- although some of these bordered into a more mythic territory in much of Australia's art scene. A significant portion of Australia's early realism was a rejection of, according to what the Sydney Bulletin called in 1881 a \\"romantic identity\\" of the country. Most of the earliest writing in the colony was not literature in the most recent international sense, but rather journals and documentations of expeditions and environments, although literary style and preconceptions entered into the journal writing. Oftentimes in early Australian literature, romanticism and realism co-existed, as exemplified by Joseph Furphy's Such Is Life (1897)-a fictional account of the life of rural dwellers, including bullock drivers, squatters and itinerant travellers, in southern New South Wales and Victoria, during the 1880s. Catherine Helen Spence's Clara Morison (1854), which detailed a Scottish woman's immigration to Adelaide, South Australia, in a time when many people were leaving the freely settled state of South Australia to claim fortunes in the gold rushes of Victoria and New South Wales. The burgeoning literary concept that Australia was an extension of another, more distant country, was beginning to infiltrate into writing: \\"[those] who have at last understood the significance of Australian history as a transplanting of stocks and the sending down of roots in a new soil\\". Henry Handel Richardson, author of post-Federation novels such as Maurice Guest (1908) and The Getting of Wisdom (1910), was said to have been heavily influenced by French and Scandinavian realism. In the twentieth century, as the working-class community of Sydney proliferated, the focus was shifted from the bush archetype to a more urban, inner-city setting: William Lane's The Working Man's Paradise (1892), Christina Stead's Seven Poor Men of Sydney (1934) and Ruth Park's The Harp in the South (1948) all depicted the harsh, gritty reality of working class Sydney. Patrick White's novels Tree of Man (1955) and Voss (1957) fared particularly well and in 1973 White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. A new kind of literary realism emerged in the late twentieth century, helmed by Helen Garner's Monkey Grip (1977) which revolutionised contemporary fiction in Australia, though it has since emerged that the novel was diaristic and based on Garner's own experiences. Monkey Grip concerns itself with a single-mother living in a succession of Melbourne share-houses, as she navigates her increasingly obsessive relationship with a drug addict who drifts in and out of her life. A sub-set of realism emerged in Australia's literary scene known as \\"dirty realism\\", typically written by \\"new, young authors\\" who examined \\"gritty, dirty, real existences\\", of lower-income young people, whose lives revolve around a nihilistic pursuit of casual sex, recreational drug use and alcohol, which are used to escape boredom. Examples of dirty-realism include Andrew McGahan's Praise (1992), Christos Tsiolkas's Loaded (1995), Justine Ettler's The River Ophelia (1995) and Brendan Cowell's How It Feels (2010), although many of these, including their predecessor Monkey Grip, are now labelled with a genre coined in 1995 as \\"grunge lit\\". =United Kingdom= Ian Watt in The Rise of the Novel (1957) saw the novel as originating in the early 18th-century and he argued that the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism': the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'.Watt, I. (1963). The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 32. His examples are novelists Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also claims that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.Watt, I. (1963). The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 61. Later in the 19th century George Eliot's (1819‚Äì1880) Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life (1871‚Äì72), described by novelists Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language, is a work of realism.Long, Camilla. Martin Amis and the sex war, The Times, 24 January 2010, p. 4: \\"They've [women] produced the greatest writer in the English language ever, George Eliot, and arguably the third greatest, Jane Austen, and certainly the greatest novel, Middlemarch.\\" Through the voices and opinions of different characters the reader becomes aware of important issues of the day, including the Reform Bill of 1832, the beginnings of the railways, and the state of contemporary medical science. Middlemarch also shows the deeply reactionary mindset within a settled community facing the prospect of what to many is unwelcome social, political and technological change. While George Gissing (1857‚Äì1903), author of New Grub Street (1891), amongst many other works, has traditionally been viewed as a naturalist, mainly influenced by √âmile Zola,Keary, C. F. (1904). \\"George Gissing,\\" The Athenaeum, Vol. XVI, p. 82. Jacob Korg has suggested that George Eliot was a greater influence. Other novelists, such as Arnold Bennett (1867‚Äì1931) and Anglo-Irishman George Moore (1852‚Äì1933), consciously imitated the French realists.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble. Oxford: Oxford University Press, (1985)1996, p.824 Bennett's most famous works are the Clayhanger trilogy (1910‚Äì18) and The Old Wives' Tale (1908). These books draw on his experience of life in the Staffordshire Potteries, an industrial area encompassing the six towns that now make up Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. George Moore, whose most famous work is Esther Waters (1894), was also influenced by the naturalism of Zola.Moran, Maureen, (2006), Victorian Literature And Culture p. 145. =United States= William Dean Howells (1837‚Äì1920) was the first American author to bring a realist aesthetic to the literature of the United States. His stories of middle and upper class life set in the 1880s and 1890s are highly regarded among scholars of American fiction. His most popular novel, The Rise of Silas Lapham (1885), depicts a man who, ironically, falls from materialistic fortune by his own mistakes. Other early American realists include Samuel Clemens (1835‚Äì1910), better known by his pen name of Mark Twain, author of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), Stephen Crane (1871‚Äì1900), and Horatio Alger, Jr. (1832-1899). Twain's style, based on vigorous, realistic, colloquial American speech, gave American writers a new appreciation of their national voice. Twain was the first major author to come from the interior of the country, and he captured its distinctive, humorous slang and iconoclasm. For Twain and other American writers of the late 19th century, realism was not merely a literary technique: It was a way of speaking truth and exploding worn-out conventions. Crane was primarily a journalist who also wrote fiction, essays, poetry, and plays. Crane saw life at its rawest, in slums and on battlefields. His haunting Civil War novel, The Red Badge of Courage, was published to great acclaim in 1895, but he barely had time to bask in the attention before he died, at 28, having neglected his health. He has enjoyed continued success ever since‚Äîas a champion of the common man, a realist, and a symbolist. Crane's Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893), is one of the best, if not the earliest, naturalistic American novel. It is the harrowing story of a poor, sensitive young girl whose uneducated, alcoholic parents utterly fail her. In love, and eager to escape her violent home life, she allows herself to be seduced into living with a young man, who soon deserts her. When her self-righteous mother rejects her, Maggie becomes a prostitute to survive, but soon commits suicide out of despair. Crane's earthy subject matter and his objective, scientific style, devoid of moralizing, earmark Maggie as a naturalist work.Holton, Milne. Cylinder of Fiction. - The Fiction and Journalistic Writing of Stephen Crane. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State UP, 1972. 37. Horatio Alger Jr. was a prolific 19th-century American author whose principal output was formulaic rags-to-riches juvenile novels that followed the adventures of bootblacks, newsboys, peddlers, buskers, and other impoverished children in their rise from humble backgrounds to lives of respectable middle-class security and comfort. His novels, of which Ragged Dick is a typical example, were hugely popular in their day. Other later American realists are: John Steinbeck, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, Upton Sinclair, Jack London, Edith Wharton and Henry James. =Europe= Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, Spanish writer from the Canary Islands Honor√© de Balzac (1799‚Äì1850) is the most prominent representative of 19th-century realism in fiction through the inclusion of specific detail and recurring characters.Rogers, Samuel (1953). Balzac & The Novel. New York: Octagon Books. .Stowe, William W (983). Balzac, James, and the Realistic Novel. Princeton: Princeton University Press. .C. P. Snow (1968). The Realists: Portraits of Eight Novelists. Macmillan. . His La Com√©die humaine, a vast collection of nearly 100 novels, was the most ambitious scheme ever devised by a writer of fiction‚Äînothing less than a complete contemporary history of his countrymen. Realism is also an important aspect of the works of Alexandre Dumas, fils (1824‚Äì1895). Many of the novels in this period, including Balzac's, were published in newspapers in serial form, and the immensely popular realist \\"roman feuilleton\\" tended to specialize in portraying the hidden side of urban life (crime, police spies, criminal slang), as in the novels of Eug√®ne Sue. Similar tendencies appeared in the theatrical melodramas of the period and, in an even more lurid and gruesome light, in the Grand Guignol at the end of the century. Gustave Flaubert's (1821‚Äì1880) acclaimed novels Madame Bovary (1857), which reveals the tragic consequences of romanticism on the wife of a provincial doctor, and Sentimental Education (1869) represent perhaps the highest stages in the development of French realism. Flaubert also wrote other works in an entirely different style and his romanticism is apparent in the fantastic The Temptation of Saint Anthony (final version published 1874) and the baroque and exotic scenes of ancient Carthage in Salammb√¥ (1862). In German literature, 19th-century realism developed under the name of \\"Poetic Realism\\" or \\"Bourgeois Realism,\\" and major figures include Theodor Fontane, Gustav Freytag, Gottfried Keller, Wilhelm Raabe, Adalbert Stifter, and Theodor Storm.; In Italian literature, the realism genre developed a detached description of the social and economic conditions of people in their time and environment. Major figures of Italian Verismo include Luigi Capuana, Giovanni Verga, Federico De Roberto, Matilde Serao, Salvatore Di Giacomo, and Grazia Deledda, who in 1926 received the Nobel Prize for Literature. Later realist writers included Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, Guy de Maupassant, Anton Chekhov, Leopoldo Alas (Clar√≠n), Jos√© Maria de E√ßa de Queiroz, Machado de Assis, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Boles≈Çaw Prus and, in a sense, √âmile Zola, whose naturalism is often regarded as an offshoot of realism. Realism in the Theatre Theatrical realism was a general movement in 19th- century theatre from the time period of 1870‚Äì1960 that developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of a broader artistic movement, it shared many stylistic choices with naturalism, including a focus on everyday (middle-class) drama, ordinary speech, and dull settings. Realism and naturalism diverge chiefly on the degree of choice that characters have: while naturalism believes in the overall strength of external forces over internal decisions, realism asserts the power of the individual to choose (see A Doll's House). Russia's first professional playwright, Aleksey Pisemsky, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy (The Power of Darkness (1886)), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia which culminated with the establishment of the Moscow Art Theatre by Constantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370, 372) and Benedetti (2005, 100) and (1999, 14-17). Their ground-breaking productions of the plays of Anton Chekhov in turn influenced Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of actor training that is particularly suited to psychological realism. 19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, \\"is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s\\" with the \\"middle-period\\" work of the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been \\"enormously influential.\\"Harrison (1998, 160). In opera, verismo refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the naturalism of √âmile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic ‚Äì sometimes sordid or violent ‚Äì depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes. In France in addition to melodramas, popular and bourgeois theater in the mid-century turned to realism in the \\"well-made\\" bourgeois farces of Eug√®ne Marin Labiche and the moral dramas of √âmile Augier.  Criticism  Critics of realism cite that depicting reality is not often realistic with some observers calling it \\"imaginary\\" or \\"project\\". This argument is based on the idea that we do not often get what is real correctly. To present reality, we draw on what is \\"real\\" according to how we remember it as well as how we experience it. However, remembered or experienced reality does not always correspond to what the truth is. Instead, we often obtain a distorted version of it that is only related to what is out there or how things really are. Realism is criticized for its supposed inability to address this challenge and such failure is seen as tantamount to complicity in a creating a process wherein \\"the artefactual nature of reality is overlooked or even concealed.\\" According to Catherine Gallagher, realistic fiction invariably undermines, in practice, the ideology it purports to exemplify because if appearances were as self-sufficient, there would probably be no need for novels. This can be demonstrated in the literary naturalism's focus during late-nineteenth-century America on the larger forces that determine the lives of its character as depicted in agricultural machines portrayed as immense and terrible, shredding \\"entangled\\" human bodies without compunction. The machines were used as a metaphor but it contributed to the perception that such narratives were more like myth than reality. There are also critics who fault realism in the way it supposedly defines itself as a reaction to the excesses of literary genres such as romanticism and Gothic - those that focus on the exotic, sentimental, and sensational narratives. Some scholars began to call this an impulse to contradict so that in the end, the limit that it imposes on itself leads to \\"either the representation of verifiable and objective truth or the merely relative, some partial, subjective truth, therefore no truth at all.\\" There are also critics who cite the absence of a fixed definition. The argument is that there is no pure form of realism and the position that it is almost impossible to find literature that is not in fact realist, at least to some extent while, and that whenever one searches for pure realism, it vanishes. J.P. Stern countered this position when he maintained that this \\"looseness\\" or \\"untidiness\\" makes the term indispensable in common and literary discourse alike. Others also dismiss it as obvious and simple-minded while denying realistic aesthetic, branding as pretentious since it is considered mere reportage, not art, and based on naive metaphysics.

Typically, events are handled synchronously with the program flow; that is, the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled, frequently an event loop. A source of events includes the user, who may interact with the software through the computer's peripherals - for example, by typing on the keyboard. Another source is a hardware device such as a timer. Software can also trigger its own set of events into the event loop, e.g. to communicate the completion of a task. Software that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be event-driven, often with the goal of being interactive.  Description  Event driven systems are typically used when there is some asynchronous external activity that needs to be handled by a program; for example, a user who presses a button on their mouse. An event driven system typically runs an event loop, that keeps waiting for such activities, e.g. input from devices or internal alarms. When one of these occurs, it collects data about the event and dispatches the event to the event handler software that will deal with it. A program can choose to ignore events, and there may be libraries to dispatch an event to multiple handlers that may be programmed to listen for a particular event. The data associated with an event at a minimum specifies what type of event it is, but may include other information such as when it occurred, who or what caused it to occur, and extra data provided by the event source to the handler about how the event should be processed. Events are typically used in user interfaces, where actions in the outside world (mouse clicks, window-resizing, keyboard presses, messages from other programs, etc.) are handled by the program as a series of events. Programs written for many windowing environments consist predominantly of event handlers. Events can also be used at instruction set level, where they complement interrupts. Compared to interrupts, events are normally handled synchronously: the program explicitly waits for an event to be serviced (typically by calling an instruction that dispatches the next event), whereas an interrupt can demand service at any time.  Delegate event model  Delegate event model. \`clickme\` is the event source -a button in this example-, and it contains a list of listeners. A common variant in object- oriented programming is the delegate event model, which is provided by some graphic user interfaces. This model is based on three entities: * a control, which is the event source * listeners, also called event handlers, that receive the event notification from the source * interfaces (in the broader meaning of the term) that describe the protocol by which the event is to be communicated. Furthermore, the model requires that: * every listener must implement the interface for the event it wants to listen to * every listener must register with the source to declare its desire to listen to the event * every time the source generates the event, it communicates it to the registered listeners, following the protocol of the interface. C# uses events as special delegates that can only be fired by the class that declares it. This allows for better abstraction, for example: delegate void Notifier (string sender); class Model { public event Notifier notifyViews; public void Change() { ... notifyViews(\\"Model\\"); } } class View1 { public View1(Model m) { m.notifyViews += new Notifier(this.Update1); } void Update1(string sender) { Console.WriteLine(sender + \\" was changed during update\\"); } } class View2 { public View2(Model m) { m.notifyViews += new Notifier(this.Update2); } void Update2(string sender) { Console.WriteLine(sender + \\" was changed\\"); } } class Test { static void Main() { Model model = new Model(); new View1(model); new View2(model); model.Change(); } }  Event handler  In computer programming, an event handler is a callback subroutine that handles inputs received in a program (called a listener in Java and JavaScripthttps://developer.mozilla.org/en- US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener). Each event is a piece of application-level information from the underlying framework, typically the GUI toolkit. GUI events include key presses, mouse movement, action selections, and timers expiring. On a lower level, events can represent availability of new data for reading a file or network stream. Event handlers are a central concept in event-driven programming. The events are created by the framework based on interpreting lower-level inputs, which may be lower-level events themselves. For example, mouse movements and clicks are interpreted as menu selections. The events initially originate from actions on the operating system level, such as interrupts generated by hardware devices, software interrupt instructions, or state changes in polling. On this level, interrupt handlers and signal handlers correspond to event handlers. Created events are first processed by an event dispatcher within the framework. It typically manages the associations between events and event handlers, and may queue event handlers or events for later processing. Event dispatchers may call event handlers directly, or wait for events to be dequeued with information about the handler to be executed.  Event notification  Event notification is a term used in conjunction with communications software for linking applications that generate small messages (the \\"events\\") to applications that monitor the associated conditions and may take actions triggered by events. Event notification is an important feature in modern database systems (used to inform applications when conditions they are watching for have occurred), modern operating systems (used to inform applications when they should take some action, such as refreshing a window), and modern distributed systems, where the producer of an event might be on a different machine than the consumer, or consumers. Event notification platforms are normally designed so that the application producing events does not need to know which applications will consume them, or even how many applications will monitor the event stream. It is sometimes used as a synonym for publish-subscribe, a term that relates to one class of products supporting event notification in networked settings. The virtual synchrony model is sometimes used to endow event notification systems, and publish-subscribe systems, with stronger fault- tolerance and consistency guarantees.  User-generated events  There are a large number of situations or events that a program or system may generate or respond to. Some common user generated events include: =Mouse events= A pointing device can generate a number of software recognisable pointing device gestures. A mouse can generate a number of mouse events, such as mouse move (including direction of move and distance), mouse left/right button up/downMouse and Keyboard Events in Windows Forms. Microsoft. Retrieved on February 12, 2008. and mouse wheel motion, or a combination of these gestures. =Keyboard events= Pressing a key on a keyboard or a combination of keys generates a keyboard event, enabling the program currently running to respond to the introduced data such as which key/s the user pressed. =Joystick events= Moving a joystick generates an X-Y analogue signal. They often have multiple buttons to trigger events. Some gamepads for popular game boxes use joysticks. =Touchscreen events= The events generated using a touchscreen are commonly referred to as touch events or gestures. =Device events= Device events include action by or to a device, such as a shake, tilt, rotation, move etc.  See also  * Callback (computer programming) * Database trigger * DOM events * Event-driven programming * Exception handling * Interrupt handler * Interrupts * Observer pattern (e.g., Event listener) * Reactor pattern vs. Proactor pattern * Signal programming * Virtual synchrony  References   External links  * Article Event Handlers and Callback Functions * A High Level Design of the Sub-Farm Event Handler * An Events Syntax for XML * Distributed Events and Notifications * Event order * Javadoc documentation * Java package Javadoc API documentation * Java package Javadoc API documentation * Write an Event Handler Category:Computer programming Category:Subroutines ","title":"Event (computing)"},{"id":"7962422","text":"View of the Manzano Mountains from the north Location of the Manzano Mountains within New Mexico Fall maple, Fourth of July Canyon The Manzano Mountains are a small mountain range in the central part of the US State of New Mexico. They are oriented north‚Äìsouth and are 30 miles long.https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:0::NO::P3_FID:918245 The center of the range lies due east of the town of Belen. The name \\"Manzano\\" is Spanish for \\"apple tree\\"; the mountains were named for apple orchards planted at the nearby town of Manzano.Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, The high point of the Manzano Mountains is Manzano Peak (10,098 ft, 3,078 m), at the southern end of the range. Other notable peaks include flat- topped Bosque Peak (9,610 ft, 2,929 m), near the center of the range, and the twin pyramids of Mosca Peak (9,509 ft, 2,898 m) and Guadalupe Peak (9,450 ft, 2,880 m). The last two are the most easily recognized peaks in the range as viewed from Albuquerque. Manzano Peak and Guadalupe Peak are the most dramatic in the range in terms of local relief and steepness; however, there are few cliffs in the range, as compared to the more dramatic Sandia Mountains. Manzano Peak and the crest and western slopes of the range are included in the Manzano Wilderness which comprises and is 17 miles (27 km) north to south and 3‚Äì5 miles (5‚Äì8 km) east-west. There are 64 miles (104 km) of trails in the wilderness, including the 22 mile Crest Trail which traverses the highest part of the range.\\"Manzano Mountains\\" Summit Post http://www.summitpost.org/manzano-mountains/347496, accessed 29 Aug 2013 The Manzano Mountains are the southern part of a larger geologic unit known as the Sandia‚ÄìManzano Mountains, which are an east-tilted fault-block range forming part of the eastern edge of the Albuquerque Basin in the Rio Grande rift. They are separated from the Sandia Mountains to the north by the \\"Manzanitas Mountains\\" and Tijeras Canyon. Both the Manzano and Sandia mountains are capped by Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, with Proterozoic metamorphic rocks making up most of the mountains' steep western faces. These include the Sevilleta metarhyolite, with an age of 1665 ¬±16 Ma. The southern part of the Manzano Mountains is in the Mountainair Ranger District while much of the northern part is in the Sandia Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest. On September 14, 1977, a USAF Boeing EC-135 crashed into the Manzano Mountains just after takeoff from the Albuquerque International Sunport, killing all 20 people on board. Compared to the Sandias, the Manzanos are much less visited, lacking the paved road and tramway access of their northern neighbors. However, many recreational sites exist, with opportunities for picnicking, camping, mountain biking, and hiking.

(Jack) Bryant, MD, 1925‚Äì2017‚Äù, American Journal of Public Health 107, no. 11 (November 1, 2017): pp. 1747-1749.  Early life and education  He attended 32 schools before entering high school. During World War II he served as a pilot in the Navy. Following the war he pursued a pre-med program of study at the University of Arizona, earning a B.A. degree in 1949 before enrolling at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons where he got his MD degree in 1953.  Career  He completed an internship and residency in medicine at Presbyterian Hospital in New York City and decided on an academic career. His first job was a postgraduate research position at the National Institutes of Health. Following a fellowship in biochemistry at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases and a special research fellowship in biochemistry at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Munich, Dr. Bryant took a fellowship in hematology at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1960, he joined the medical faculty of the University of Vermont and served as director of the clinical research program and later as assistant dean in charge of undergraduate education. His life changed when he was invited to help the Rockefeller Foundation with a study of health in the developing world. In 1969 Cornell University Press published his first book \\"Health & the Developing World\\".Bryant, John, Health & the developing world. Ithaca (N.Y.) Cornell University Press (1969) Dr. Bryant's landmark assessment of the problems and vast inequities in health care delivery in the world's less economically favored nations. The book's systematic approach, fair assessment, and stark conclusions stunned many of its readers and helped inspire an entire generation of students in public and international health. Following the completion of his study, the Rockefeller Foundation arranged for him to write up the results in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was appointed professor of medicine at the Ramathibodi Hospital Faculty of Medicine and where he simultaneously served as a consultant on medical education to the government of Thailand. In Thailand Dr. Bryant shifted his focus from clinical medicine to the business of teaching health to people at the community level and reaching populations that weren't served. He helped establish a program in community medicine, in the process helping Thailand transform its medical education programs. Meanwhile, \\"Health & the Developing World\\" brought him to the attention of the Columbia University administration. In 1971, he was named Joseph DeLamar Professor of Public Health, director of the School of Public Health, and Associate Dean of the Faculty of Medicine (Public Health). During his tenure at the helm, with Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundation support, Dr. Bryant created the Center for Community Health Development to help foster a more fluid and effective interaction among the medical school, Presbyterian Hospital, the community, and smaller hospitals and health care centers in the community. With the goal of breaking through institutional barriers to reach out to the community, he developed interdisciplinary programs with Columbia's business and social work schools. In 1978, Dr. Julius Richmond, U.S. Surgeon General under President Jimmy Carter, invited him to expand the activities of the Office of International Health and increase its effectiveness in linking the United States with international health activities. As director of the office and deputy assistant secretary for international health in the Department of Health and Human Services from 1978 to 1983, Dr. Bryant represented the U.S. government on the executive board of the World Health Organization (WHO) and participated in a number of joint US-WHO activities, including the development of the WHO Code on Infant Formulas. In 1978 Dr. Bryant served as a member of the U.S. delegation to the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, then a part of the USSR. The first international gathering to recognize the need to reach out beyond existing hospital structures, Alma Ata affirmed that \\"no one would be left out.\\" Its very name became a catchword for the fundamental doctrine of \\"health for all.\\" In 1985, his input was sought in the creation of Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan. What began as a consultancy blossomed into an appointment. Dr. Bryant was named Noordin M. Thobani Professor and founding chairman of the Department of Community Health Sciences, a position he held until 1993, when he retired as emeritus professor. In the course of those eight years, Dr. Bryant helped design the curriculum and build the faculty of what became the university's largest department. Dr. Bryant has been a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences; he served a tenure as chairman of the Christian Medical Commission of the World Council of Churches, advising that group on how best to continue to participate in health-care delivery in newly independent African states. He helped the council shift its focus from an exclusive dependence on mission hospitals. As a member since 1982 and president since 1990 of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, he helped organize a number of international conferences on health policy, ethics and human values, and various aspects of the international pharmaceutical industry. This role has led to many cooperative efforts with the Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences, to which he was a trusted adviser. Since the mid-1970s, he has served as a consultant to, and subsequently joined the board of, H√¥pital Albert Schweitzer in Haiti. In 1998, Dr. Bryant engaged in co-organizing a WHO conference in Geneva on equity in health-care delivery. This work expanded into a series of workshops on the ethics of health-care delivery, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, and workshops were held in Pakistan, Thailand, Mexico, and Colombia. He helped the government of Thailand cope with a serious \\"brain drain\\" of its physicians from rural to urban areas. He helped create and taught at the Tropical Institute for Community Health and Development for Africa in Kisumu, Kenya, and lent his guidance to students and faculty in the development there of community-based Orphan Care Support Systems. Among other projects, he is participated in an effort to develop the Pakistan-India Forum for Health and Well-Being as a binational health research collaboration in the interest of peace. Recipient in 2000 of the Life Time Achievement Award for Excellence in International Health of the American Public Health Association and in 2001 of an honorary doctorate of science degree from the University of Arizona. He is author or co-author of multiple books and monographs. Retirement He lived in a retirement community in Charlottesville, Virginia. Each summer, he worked in Kenya, teaching in Kisumu at the Tropical Institute for Community Health and Development. He also worked with UN Habitat, Nairobi, on the problems of Aids Orphans and Vulnerable Children in the Urban Slums of Africa. In 2011 he received the Gordon Wyon Award from the American Public Health Association for his outstanding contribution to Community-Based Public Health.Weblog of APHA's International Health Section Bryant died on July 5, 2017, in the retirement community of Westminster Canterbury of the Blue Ridge, Charlottesville, Virginia aged 92.

In the preface to the novel, he is described as a \\"receiver of stolen goods\\". He is the leader of a group of children (the Artful Dodger and Charley Bates among them) whom he teaches to make their livings by pickpocketing and other criminal activities, in exchange for shelter. A distinguishing trait is his constant‚Äîand insincere‚Äîuse of the phrase \\"my dear\\" when addressing others. At the time of the novel, he is said by another character, Monks, to have already made criminals out of \\"scores\\" of children. Nancy, who is the lover of Bill Sikes (the novel's lead villain), is confirmed to be Fagin's former pupil. Fagin is a confessed miser who, despite the wealth that he has acquired, does very little to improve the squalid lives of the children he guards, or his own. In the second chapter of his appearance, he is shown (when talking to himself) that he cares less for their welfare, than that they do not \\"peach\\" (inform) on him and the other children. Still darker sides to the character's nature are shown when he beats the Artful Dodger for not bringing Oliver back; in his attempted beating of Oliver for trying to escape; and in his own involvement with various plots and schemes throughout the story. He indirectly but intentionally causes the death of Nancy by falsely informing Sikes that she had betrayed him, when in reality she had shielded Sikes from the law, whereupon Sikes kills her. Near the end of the book, Fagin is captured and sentenced to be hanged, in a chapter that portrays him as pitiable in his anguish. In popular culture, Fagin (or at least his name) is used in comparison with adults who use children for illegal activities. Historical basis Dickens took Fagin's name from a friend he had known in his youth while working in a boot-blacking factory. Fagin's character might be based on the criminal Ikey Solomon, who was a fence at the centre of a highly publicised arrest, escape, recapture, and trial. Some accounts of Solomon also describe him as a London underworld \\"kidsman\\" (a kidsman was an adult who recruited children and trained them as pickpockets, exchanging food and shelter for goods the children stole). The popularity of Dickens' novel caused \\"fagin\\" to replace \\"kidsman\\" in some crime circles, denoting an adult who teaches minors to steal and keeps a major portion of the loot. Other sources, such as Howard Mancing in The Cervantes Encyclopedia, claim that Fagin is assumed to be modeled on Monipodio, one of the main characters in Miguel de Cervantes' Rinconete y Cortadillo (1613). Monipodio is the leader of a criminal ring in 17th-century Seville that features cutpurses and cape stealers. Allegations of antisemitism Fence Ikey Solomon, on whom Fagin has often been said to be based Fagin has been the subject of much debate over antisemitism, during Dickens' lifetime and in modern times. In an introduction to a 1981 Bantam Books reissue of Oliver Twist, for example, Irving Howe wrote that Fagin was considered an \\"archetypical Jewish villain.\\" The first 38 chapters of the book refer to Fagin by his racial and religious origin 257 times, calling him \\"the Jew\\", against 42 uses of \\"Fagin\\" or \\"the old man\\". Dickens, who had extensive knowledge of London street life, wrote that he had made Fagin Jewish because: \\"it unfortunately was true, of the time to which the story refers, that the class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew\\". It is often argued that Fagin was based on a specific Jewish criminal of the era, Ikey Solomon.Donald Hawes, Who's Who in Dickens, Routledge, London, 2002, p.75. Dickens also claimed that by calling Fagin \\"the Jew\\" he had meant no imputation against the Jewish people: \\"I have no feeling towards the Jews but a friendly one. I always speak well of them, whether in public or private, and bear my testimony (as I ought to do) to their perfect good faith in such transactions as I have ever had with them...\\" In later editions of the book, printed during his lifetime, Dickens excised over 180 instances of 'Jew' from the text. This occurred after Dickens sold his London home in 1860 to a Jewish banker, James Davis, who objected to the emphasis on Fagin's Jewishness in the novel. When he sold the house, Dickens allegedly told a friend: \\"The purchaser of Tavistock House will be a Jew Money-Lender.\\" Dickens became friends with Davis' wife Eliza, who told him in a letter in 1863 that Jews regarded his portrayal of Fagin a \\"great wrong\\" to their people. Dickens then started to revise Oliver Twist, removing all mention of \\"the Jew\\" from the last 15 chapters; and later wrote in reply: \\"There is nothing but good will left between me and a People for whom I have a real regard and to whom I would not willfully have given an offence\\". In one of his final public readings in 1869, a year before his death, Dickens cleansed Fagin of all stereotypical caricature. A contemporary report observed: \\"There is no nasal intonation; a bent back but no shoulder-shrug: the conventional attributes are omitted.\\" In 1865, in Our Mutual Friend, Dickens created a number of Jewish characters, the most important being Mr Riah, an elderly Jew who finds jobs for downcast young women in Jewish-owned factories. One of the two heroines, Lizzie Hexam, defends her Jewish employers: \\"The gentleman certainly is a Jew, and the lady, his wife, is a Jewess, and I was brought to their notice by a Jew. But I think there cannot be kinder people in the world.\\" The comic book creator Will Eisner, disturbed by the antisemitism in the typical depiction of the character, created a graphic novel in 2003 titled Fagin the Jew. In this book, the back story of the character and events of Oliver Twist are depicted from his point of view. Media portrayals Fagin waits to be hanged. Numerous prominent actors have played the character of Fagin. Alec Guinness portrayed Fagin in David Lean's 1948 film adaptation of Oliver Twist, with controversial make-up by Stuart Freeborn which exaggerated stereotypical Jewish facial features. The release of the film in the USA was delayed for three years on charges of being anti-Semitic by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the New York Board of Rabbis. It was finally released in the United States in 1951, with seven minutes of profile shots and other parts of Guinness' performance cut. Ron Moody's portrayal in the original London production of the musical Oliver! by Lionel Bart, which he repeated in the Oscar-winning 1968 film, is recognizably influenced by Guinness' portrayal. However, the antisemitic quality of Guinness' portrayal was considerably toned down in the musical, partly because of Moody being Jewish himself; he was in fact the first Jewish actor to portray Fagin. While Fagin remains an unrepentant thief, he is a much more sympathetic and comic character than he is in the novel. His plot with Monks is deleted and his role in Nancy's death is similarly excised, and he is portrayed as being cowardly and deeply afraid of Bill Sikes. Fagin is completely innocent of Nancy's murder and is horrified when he finds out. He even admonishes Sikes saying that: \\"[He] should not have done that.\\" Bart's musical also deletes Fagin's arrest and the musical ends with Fagin, faced with beginning again, pondering the possibility of going straight. The film version reverses this ending, with Fagin briefly considering reformation, but then gleefully teaming up again with Dodger to start their racket again. Moody's performance as the character is often considered the most critically acclaimed. He won a Golden Globe for his performance, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. When Oliver! was brought to Broadway in 1964, Fagin was portrayed by Clive Revill, but in a 1984 revival, Moody reprised his performance opposite Tony Award winner Patti LuPone, who played Nancy. Moody later stated: \\"Fate destined me to play Fagin. It was the part of a lifetime.\\" Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Fagin in Roman Polanski's 2005 screen adaptation was also inspired by the 1948 version. In the 1980 ATV series The Further Adventures of Oliver Twist, Fagin was played by David Swift. In this 13-episode series, Fagin has escaped his hanging by pretending to have had a stroke, which has left him paralyzed (and therefore unfit to be executed) and is in hiding at The Three Cripples, tended to by Barney. In the 1982 made-for-TV movie version, Fagin is portrayed by George C. Scott. Although the character is generally portrayed as elderly, diminutive, and homely, Scott's version of the character was markedly younger, stronger, and better-looking. Also, this version of the character had him more caring of his orphan charges, feeding them well and treating them with obvious concern. In the 1985 miniseries, Fagin is portrayed by Eric Porter. In Disney's animated version, Oliver & Company (1988), Fagin is a kind-hearted but poor man living in New York City. He lives in poverty with his five dogs and is desperately searching for money to repay his debts to a ruthless loan shark. This version does away with the moral quandary of child exploitation as all the characters are dogs who have no real need for money and genuinely want to help their owner. Informed by earlier portrayals, he retains a large nose but his racial characteristics, religion or \\"Jewishness\\" play no role in his character. He is voiced by Dom DeLuise. In 1994, Oliver! was revived in London. Fagin was played by many noted British actors and comedians, including Jonathan Pryce, George Layton, Jim Dale, Russ Abbot, Barry Humphries (who had played Mr Sowerberry in the original 1960 London production of Oliver!) and Robert Lindsay, who won an Olivier Award for his performance. The different actors playing Fagin were distinguished by their different costumes, especially their coats. Pryce used a patched red and brown coat, while Lindsay used the traditional dark green overcoat seen in the 1968 film version. In Disney's live action television production Oliver Twist (1997), Fagin is played by Richard Dreyfuss. In the film Twisted (1996), a film loosely based on Dickens' Oliver Twist, the Fagin character is played by actor William Hickey. In the miniseries Escape of the Artful Dodger (2001), Fagin is played by actor Christopher Baz. In the film Twist (2003), a film also loosely based on Dickens' Oliver Twist, Fagin is played by actor Gary Farmer. In a 2007 BBC television adaptation, Fagin is played by Timothy Spall. Contrary to his appearance in the novel, he is beardless and overweight in this version. He is also a more sympathetic character. In December 2008, Oliver! was revived at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London with Rowan Atkinson playing the character. This role was taken over by Omid Djalili in July 2009. Griff Rhys Jones took over the role from Omid Djalili in December 2009. He was succeeded by Russ Abbot in June 2010. In 2015-16, BBC2's Dickensian Fagin was played by the actor Anton Lesser.

The West Berkeley Shellmound, a Chochenyo shellmound During the California Mission Era, the Chochenyos moved en masse to the Mission San Francisco de As√≠s (founded in 1776) in San Francisco, and Mission San Jos√© of Fremont (founded in 1797). Most moved into one of these missions and were baptized, lived and educated to be Catholic neophytes, also known as Mission Indians, until the missions were discontinued by the Mexican Government in 1834. Then the people found themselves landless. A large majority of the Chochenyo died from disease in the missions and shortly thereafter, only a fragment remaining by 1900. The speech of the last two native speakers of Chochenyo was documented in the 1920s in the unpublished fieldnotes of the Bureau of American Ethnology linguist John Peabody Harrington.

'Ultra-linear' is a special case of 'distributed loading'; a circuit technique patented by Alan Blumlein in 1937 (Patent No. 496,883), although the name 'distributed loading' is probably due to Mullard. In 1938 he applied for the US patent 2218902. The particular advantages of ultra-linear operation, and the name itself, were published by David Hafler and Herbert Keroes in the early 1950s through articles in the magazine \\"Audio Engineering\\" from the USA. Alt URL. The special case of 'ultra linear' operation is sometimes confused with the more general principle of distributed loading. Operation A pentode or tetrode vacuum-tube (valve) configured as a common-cathode amplifier (where the output signal appears on the plate) may be operated as: * a pentode or tetrode, in which the screen-grid is connected to a stable DC voltage so there are no signal variations on the screen-grid (i.e. the screen- grid has 0% of the plate's output signal impressed on it), or * a triode, in which the screen-grid is connected to the plate (i.e. the screen-grid has 100% of the plate's output signal voltage impressed on it), or * a blend of triode and pentode, in which the screen-grid has a percentage (between 0% and 100%) of the plate's output signal impressed on it. This is the basis of the distributed load circuit, and is usually achieved by incorporating a suitable \\"tap\\" on the primary winding of the output transformer that the vacuum-tube (valve) is connected to. The impression of any portion of the output signal onto the screen-grid can be seen as a form of feedback, which alters the behaviour of the electron stream passing from cathode to anode. Advantages By judicious choice of the screen-grid percentage-tap, the benefits of both triode and pentode vacuum-tubes can be realised. Over a very narrow range of percentage-tapping, distortion is found to fall to an unusually low value-- sometimes less than for either triode or pentode operation--while power efficiency is only slightly reduced compared with full pentode operation. The optimum percentage-tap to achieve ultra-linear operation depends mainly on the type of valve used; a commonly seen percentage is 43% (of the number of transformer primary turns on the plate-circuit) which applies to the KT88, although many other valve types have optimum values close to this. A value of 20% was recommended for 6V6GTs. Mullard circuits such as the 5-20 also used 20% distributed loading (but did not achieve ultra-linear operation), while LEAK amplifiers used 50%. The characteristics of the circuit which make distributed loading suitable for audio power amplifiers, when compared to a tetrode or pentode amplifier, are: * The output impedance is lowered to be about half that achieved with a triode. * Distortion is lowered to approach that achieved with a triode tube, but may be even less for ultra-linear operation. * The power output is higher than from a triode, approaching that delivered by a pentode. * The power output is more constant as distributed loading is a combination of a transconductance amplifier and a voltage amplifier. The distributed load circuit may be applied to either push-pull or single-ended amplifier circuits. Note that the term 'ultra linear' was expressly reserved only for the condition of optimum tapping point. As Hafler and Keroes wrote: \\"Our patent claims cover the use of any primary tap in this circuit arrangement. However, we have restricted the use of the term \\"Ultra Linear\\" to the conditions where the dynamic plate characteristic curves are most linear\\". Related circuits The \\"QUAD II\\" amplifier from QUAD uses a circuit in which the cathode has a portion of the output signal applied to it, and was referred to as \\"distributed load\\" by Peter Walker of QUAD. In the United States, McIntosh Laboratories used this technique extensively in their vacuum-tube power amplifiers. Audio Research Corp have also used a similar circuit.

Early life  Born in Bournemouth, the son of the late Lord Forte and his wife Irene, he was educated at St Peter's Catholic School, Southbourne (at the time an independent and fee-paying Roman Catholic grammar school) and Downside School. He read modern languages at Pembroke College, Oxford, where he won a blue for fencing. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1969, later becoming a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1979.  Career  Forte took over from his father as CEO of the Forte Group in 1992. In the mid-1990s, the Forte Group was faced with a hostile takeover bid from Gerry Robinson's Granada. Ultimately, Granada succeeded with a ¬£3.87 billion tender offer in August 1995 that left the family with around ¬£350 million in cash. In 2001, following the de-merger of Compass Group from Granada's media interests, the use of the Forte trademark was returned to Forte in a gesture intended to dispel the bitter legacy of the takeover. After the takeover, Forte set up his own chain of hotels in 1996, initially known as RF Hotels and re-branded as The Rocco Forte Collection after the return of the Forte brand name. He bought the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh and Brown's Hotel in London for ¬£51.5m. As of April 2013, The Rocco Forte Collection operates eleven hotels in Europe, Russia, northern Africa and the Middle East. Forte's family wealth in 2013 was listed as ¬£250,000,000. Honours and awards Forte was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1995 New Year Honours list for services to the UK tourism industry. In March 2005, he received the highest Italian accolade, the Gran Croce dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana, for his entrepreneurial merits and strong links with Italy. He was President of the British Hospitality Association from 1991 to 1996. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the World Travel & Tourism Council and chaired the appeals to send the English teams to the Commonwealth Games for many years. Philanthropy Forte funded a series of lectures at Westminster Cathedral in April 2008 organised by Cardinal Archbishop Cormac Murphy-O'Connor. In 1992, Forte and Martin Landau opened a City Technology College in Derby named Landau Forte College. In 2006, they changed to an academy. In 2010, they took a Tamworth High School (Woodhouse Business & Enterprise College) and turned it into Landau Forte Academy Tamworth, but in 2011, when they opened Landau Forte Academy QEMS in Tamworth, they changed their name to Landau Forte Academy Amington. There has since been a Sixth Form centre open next to Landau Forte Academy QEMS named Landau Forte Academy Tamworth Sixth Form. Political activity Forte paid for a victory party for Boris Johnson in one of his hotels upon him winning the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election. He donated ¬£100,000 to the Conservative Party during the 2019 general election.

They are the context-free languages that can be accepted by a deterministic pushdown automaton. DCFLs are always unambiguous, meaning that they admit an unambiguous grammar. There are non- deterministic unambiguous CFLs, so DCFLs form a proper subset of unambiguous CFLs. DCFLs are of great practical interest, as they can be parsed in linear time, and various restricted forms of DCFGs admit simple practical parsers. They are thus widely used throughout computer science. Description The notion of the DCFL is closely related to the deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA). It is where the language power of pushdown automatons is reduced to if we make them deterministic; the pushdown automatons become unable to choose between different state-transition alternatives and as a consequence cannot recognize all context-free languages. Unambiguous grammars do not always generate a DCFL. For example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the unambiguous context-free grammar S ‚Üí 0S0  1S1  Œµ. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first, which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string. Properties Deterministic context-free languages can be recognized by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time and O(log2 n) space; as a corollary, DCFL is a subset of the complexity class SC. The set of deterministic context-free languages is closed under the following operations: *complement *inverse homomorphism *right quotient with a regular language *pre: pre( L ) is the subset of all strings having a proper prefix that also belongs to L . *min: min( L ) is the subset of all strings do not have a proper prefix in L . *max: max( L ) is the subset of all strings that are not the prefix of a longer string in L . The set of deterministic context-free language is not closed under the following operations: *union *intersection *concatenation *Kleene star *Œµ-free morphism *Mirror image Importance The languages of this class have great practical importance in computer science as they can be parsed much more efficiently than nondeterministic context-free languages. The complexity of the program and execution time of a deterministic pushdown automaton is vastly less than that of a nondeterministic one. In the naive implementation, the latter must make copies of the stack every time a nondeterministic step occurs. The best known algorithm to test membership in any context-free language is Valiant's algorithm, taking O(2.378) time, where is the length of the string. On the other hand, deterministic context-free languages can be accepted in O() time by an LR() parser. This is very important for computer language translation because many computer languages belong to this class of languages.

History  In 1959, the State Government of Queensland, Australia, invited local Rotary Clubs to help plan an event to help celebrate the upcoming centennial of the state. Princess Alexandra, who was in her early 20s was due to attend the celebrations, so activities were planned specifically for the princess's age group. The gundoo, an aboriginal word meaning \\"festival\\" or \\"fun together,\\" was deemed successful with more than 300 men and women between the ages of 17 and 23 attending. Encouraged by the event's popularity with the young attendees, Rotary saw potential to create an annual youth program based on Gundoo. The governor of the then District 260, Art Brand, approved the project and on 2 May 1960, RYLA was an official Rotary project. Australian districts 258 and 260 established a committee together that developed the official framework of RYLA: > to train youth ages 14-30 in character, leadership, personal development, > and good citizenship. These guidelines helped RYLA expand to all Rotary districts in Australia and led to its approval as a Rotary International program by the RI Board at the 1971 Convention in Sydney, Australia.

There are multiple types of neurogenic bladder depending on the underlying cause and the symptoms. Symptoms include overactive bladder, urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence or difficulty passing urine. A range of diseases or conditions can cause neurogenic bladder including spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain injury, spina bifida, peripheral nerve damage, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. Neurogenic bladder can be diagnosed through a history and physical as well as imaging and more specialized testing. Treatment depends on underlying disease as well as symptoms and can be managed with behavioral changes, medications, surgeries, or other procedures. The symptoms of neurogenic bladder, especially incontinence, can have a significant impact on quality of life. Classification There are different types of neurogenic bladder depending on the underlying cause. Many of these types may have similar symptoms. Urinary bladder and urethra (red) with ureters (green) =Uninhibited= Uninhibited bladder is usually due to damage to the brain from a stroke or brain tumor. This can cause reduced sensation of bladder fullness, low capacity bladder and urinary incontinence. Unlike other forms of neurogenic bladder, it does not lead to high bladder pressures that can cause kidney damage. =Spastic= In spastic neurogenic bladder (also known as upper motor neuron or hyper-reflexive bladder), the muscle of the bladder (detrusor) and urethral sphincter do not work together and are usually tightly contracted at the same time. This phenomenon is also called detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD). This leads to urinary retention with high pressures in the bladder that can damage the kidneys. The bladder volume is usually smaller than normal due to increased muscle tone in the bladder. Spastic neurogenic bladder is usually caused by damage to the spinal cord above the level of the 10th thoracic vertebrae (T10). =Flaccid= In flaccid bladder (also known as lower motor neuron or hypotonic bladder), the muscles of the bladder lose ability to contract normally. This can cause the inability to void urine even if the bladder is full and cause a large bladder capacity. The internal urinary sphincter can contract normally, however urinary incontinence is common. This type of neurogenic bladder is caused by damage to the peripheral nerves that travel from the spinal cord to the bladder. =Mixed= Mixed type of neurogenic bladder can cause a combination of the above presentations. In mixed type A, the bladder muscle is flaccid but the sphincter is overactive. This creates a large, low pressure bladder and inability to void, but does not carry as much risk for kidney damage as a spastic bladder. Mixed type B is characterized by a flaccid external sphincter and a spastic bladder causing problems with incontinence. Signs and symptoms Neurogenic bladder can cause a range of urinary symptoms including urinary urgency, urinary incontinence or difficulty urinating (urinary retention.) The first sign of bladder dysfunction may be recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Causes Urine storage and elimination (urination) requires coordination between the bladder emptying muscle (detrusor) and the external sphincter of the bladder. This coordination can be disrupted by damage or diseases of the central nervous system, peripheral nerves or autonomic nervous system. This includes any condition that impairs bladder signaling at any point along the path from the urination center in the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves and the bladder. = Central nervous system = Damage to the brain or spinal cord is the most common cause of neurogenic bladder. Damage to the brain can be caused by stroke, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative conditions. Bladder involvement is more likely if the damage is in the area of the pons. Damage to the spinal cord can be caused by traumatic injury, demyelinating disease, syringomyelia, cauda equina syndrome, or spina bifida. Spinal cord compression from herniated disks, tumor, or spinal stenosis can also result in neurogenic bladder. = Peripheral nervous system = Damage to the nerves that travel from the spinal cord to the bladder (peripheral nerves) can cause neurogenic bladder, usually the flaccid type. Nerve damage can be caused by diabetes, alcoholism, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Peripheral nerves can also be damaged as a complication of major surgery of the pelvis, such as for removal of tumors. Diagnosis Cystourethrograph showing bladder obstruction with dilation of urethra and bladder The diagnosis of neurogenic bladder is made based on a complete history and physical examination and may require imaging and specialized studies. History should include information on the onset, duration, triggers, severity, other medical conditions and medications (including anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, sedatives, alpha- adrenergic agonist, alpha 1 antagonists). Urinary symptoms may include frequency, urgency, incontinence or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Questionnaires can be helpful in quantifying symptom burden. In children it is important to obtain a prenatal and developmental history. Ultrasound imaging can give information on the shape of the bladder, post-void residual volume, and evidence of kidney damage such as kidney size, thickness or ureteral dilation. A voiding cystourethrography study uses contrast dye to obtain images of the bladder both when it is full and after urination which can show changes in bladder shape consistent with neurogenic bladder. Urodynamic studies are an important component of the evaluation for neurogenic bladder. Urodynamics refers to the measurement of the pressure-volume relationship in the bladder. The bladder usually stores urine at low pressure and urination can be completed without a dramatic pressure rise. Damage to the kidneys is probable if the pressure rises above 40 cm of water during filling. Bladder pressure can be measured by cystometry, during which the bladder is artificially filled with a catheter and bladder pressures and detrusor activity are monitored. Patterns of involuntary detrusor activity as well as bladder flexibility, or compliance, can be evaluated. The most valuable test to test for detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DESD) is to perform cystometry simultaneously with external sphincter electromyography (EMG). Uroflowmetry is a less-invasive study that can measure urine flow rate and use it to estimate detrusor strength and sphincter resistance. Urethral pressure monitoring is another less-invasive approach to assessing detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. These studies can be repeated at regular intervals, especially if symptoms worsen or to measure response to therapies. Evaluation of kidney function through blood tests such as serum creatinine should be obtained. Imaging of the pelvis with CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging may be necessary, especially if there is concern for an obstruction such as a tumor. The inside of the bladder can be visualized by cystoscopy. Treatment Treatment depends on the type of neurogenic bladder and other medical problems. Treatment strategies include catheterization, medications, surgeries or other procedures. The goals of treatment is to keep bladder pressures in a safe range and eliminate residual urine in the bladder after urination (post-void residual volumes). =Catherization= Emptying the bladder with the use of a catheter is the most common strategy for managing urinary retention from neurogenic bladder. For most patients, this can be accomplished with intermittent catherization which involves no surgery or permanently attached appliances. Intermittent catheterization involves using straight catheters (which are usually disposable or single-use products) several times a day to empty the bladder. This can be done independently or with assistance. For people who are unable to use disposable straight catheters, a Foley catheter allows continuous drainage of urine into a sterile drainage bag that is worn by the patient but are associated with higher rates of complications. =Medications= Oxybutynin is a common anti-cholinergic medication used to reduce bladder contractions by blocking M3 muscarinic receptors in the detrusor. Its use is limited by side effects such as dry mouth, constipation and decreased sweating. Tolterodine is a longer acting anticholinergic that may have fewer side effects. For urinary retention, cholinergics (muscarinic agonists) like bethanechol can improve the squeezing ability of the bladder. Alpha blockers can also reduce outlet resistance and allow complete emptying if there is adequate bladder muscle function. =Botulinum Toxin= Botulinum toxin (Botox) can be used through two different approaches. For spastic neurogenic bladder, the bladder muscle (detrusor) can be injected which will cause it to be flaccid for 6‚Äì9 months. This prevents high bladder pressures and intermittent catherization must be used during this time. Botox can also be injected into the external sphincter to paralyze a spastic sphincter in patients with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. = Neuromodulation = There are various strategies to alter the interaction between the nerves and muscles of the bladder, including nonsurgical therapies (transurethral electrical bladder stimulation), minimally invasive procedures (sacral neuromodulation pacemaker), and operative (reconfiguration of sacral nerve root anatomy). =Surgery= Surgical interventions may be pursued if medical approaches have been maximized. Surgical options depend on the type of dysfunction observed on urodynamic testing, and may include: * Urinary Diversion: Creation of a stoma (from the intestines, called \\"conduit\\") that bypasses the urethra to empty the bladder directly through a skin opening. Several techniques may be used. One technique is the Mitrofanoff stoma, where the appendixor a portion of the ileum (‚ÄòYang-Monti‚Äô conduit) are used to create the diversion. The ileum and ascending colon can also be used to create a pouch accessible for catheterization (Indiana pouch). * Urethral stents or urethral sphincterotomy are other surgical approaches that can reduce bladder pressures but require use of an external urinary collection device. * Urethral slings may be used in both adults and children * Artificial Urinary Sphincters have shown good term outcomes in adults and pediatric patients. One study on 97 patients followed for a mean duration of 4 years found that 92% percent were continent at day and night during follow up. However, patients in this study who had intermediate-type bladders underwent adjuvent cystoplasty.  Epidemiology  The overall prevalence of neurogenic bladder is limited due to the broad range of conditions that can lead to urinary dysfunction. Neurogenic bladder is common with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Rates of some type of urinary dysfunction surpass 80% one year after spinal cord injury. Among patients with multiple sclerosis, 20‚Äì25% will develop neurogenic bladder although the type and severity bladder dysfunction is variable. Complications Neurogenic bladder can cause hydronephrosis, recurrent urinary tract infections, and recurrent kidney stones which may compromise kidney function. This is especially significant in spastic neurogenic bladder that leads to high bladder pressures. Kidney failure was previously a leading cause of mortality in patients with spinal cord injury but is now dramatically less common due to improvements in bladder management.

Early life William grew up on his father‚Äôs farm where he was born, near Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 1836 he proceeded to Georgetown, Massachusetts, and finding employment in a shoe factory there, remained about ten years. Also in 1836, William married Louisa Bartlett (born Lois-White Bartlett). Their daughter Sarah Louise Hayward was born in 1838. Louisa died in 1840. California Gold Rush Learning of the 1848 finding of gold in California, Hayward booked passage on the steamer Unicorn which set sail on April 23, 1849, steamed through the Strait of Magellan, and arrived in San Francisco on August 31, 1849. Proceeding to the gold fields, he \\"mined as long as his money lasted\\" and then returned to the San Francisco Bay Area, a disappointed gold seeker. For a while, William squatted on Guillermo Castro's ranch, in Palomares Canyon (). Castro tried to evict him, but William persuaded him otherwise by making him a pair of boots. His stubbornness and shoe-making ability convinced Castro to hire him. William set up a small store and saved up enough money to buy of Castro's land including what is now the downtown Hayward area. On this land, he established a store and a small dairy operation. This land was along the road that ran from San Jose to Oakland (now called Mission Boulevard in the portion through Hayward and southward). Castro emigrated to Chile with most of his family in 1864, after he lost his land in a card game. His ranch was split up and sold to various locals, William among them. He constructed a resort hotel on what is now the northeast corner of Main and A Streets, which eventually grew to a hundred rooms. The surrounding area came to be called \\"Haywards\\" after William's hotel which bore the name \\"Haywards Hotel\\" (no apostrophe before the \\"s\\"). Haywards Hotel Haywards Hotel became a destination for travelers and tourists. It grew to be four stories. Inside the grand building was a large lobby, reception rooms, dining halls, and sitting and card rooms. The hotel also served as a post office. The main force behind the success of Haywards Hotel wasn't William Hayward, but his wife Rachel, who arranged and managed parties, receptions, picnics, rides, and entertainment for guests. The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1923. Town of Haywards William then became the road commissioner for Alameda County. He used his authority to influence the construction of roads in his own favor. In 1876, the town was chartered under the name of \\"Haywards\\". However, it was not legal to name a post office after a living person, so the official name was \\"Haywood\\". In 1876, \\"Haywood\\" was incorporated as the \\"Town of Haywards\\", with a population of 1,100. William served two terms on the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. On April 5, 1866, William married Mrs. Rachel Rhodes Bedford, a widow, in Haywards. Rachel had a daughter from her first marriage, Mary E. Bedford (b. Feb. 1852). William and Rachel had one child together, William Martin Hayward. 1991 dedication at Hayward gravesite William Hayward died at age 75, as a result of skin cancer, at Haywards Hotel, and was buried in Lone Tree Cemetery in Fairview, near Hayward.

This arguably sealed the song's cult status among SFA fans, and it became the group's standard set-closer when playing live: the outro would often extend to ten or twenty minutes, with keyboard player Cian Ciaran in particular taking the opportunity to improvise wildly around the basic sample. A live version was released in 2004. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 66 on its list \\"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\\".150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years  NME.COM Themes \\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\\" was written by Super Furry Animals as a \\"multi-compass protest anthem\\" according to the band's singer and chief lyricist Gruff Rhys. Rhys has claimed that the track does not refer to a particular issue but is about the \\"mistreatment that we've had at the hands of politicians for years\\". Rhys has described \\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\\" as a \\"protest song for our time\\" which can be used against \\"any organisation which you feel is terrorising you as an individual, anyone who's cramping your style\\". On the song's initial single release in 1996, Rhys stated that the track \\"could be used now to bring down the Government, but in five years time the world could be run by some pilots from Venus, and they will be The Man\\". First release \\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\\" was issued as a single in December 1996, having originally been set for release as a B-side on Super Furry Animals' previous single \\"If You Don't Want Me to Destroy You\\". Steely Dan frontman Donald Fagen was upset that a sample of his band's track \\"Show Biz Kids\\" featured so prominently on \\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\\", and refused Super Furry Animals' request to use it at the time. Eventually Fagen relented but demanded 95% of the track's proceeds, a situation which Rhys was happy with as he felt the song would never get played due to its frequent use of the swear word 'fuck'. Asked about the \\"perverse\\" decision to release a single containing the word 'fuck' 50 times by a journalist for X-Ray magazine in 2003, Rhys claimed that the band allowed themselves to be manipulated by former label Creation Records who came up with the idea. The group felt that by issuing the track as a single they could \\"remind people how ridiculous censorship is\\", with Rhys stating that he didn't think people found 'fuck' to be offensive anymore \\"unless you're in the church where it's beaten into you that ... swearing is bad\\". The single's packaging features a photograph of the footballer Robin Friday showing a V sign to Luton Town goalkeeper Milija Aleksic while playing for Cardiff City. The artwork also features a dedication to the memory of Friday \\"and his stand against the 'Man'\\" alongside the Welsh proverb \\"Stwffiwch y dolig ddim y twrci\\" which roughly translates into English as \\"Stuff Christmas not a turkey\\". The song was recorded and produced by Gorwel Owen at his home studio in Llanfaelog, Anglesey, Wales. Second release A live, 23 minute version was released in 2004 as a single with the word 'fuck' mentioned approximately 100 times. It was recorded in London's Hammersmith Apollo. It was printed in a limited edition with an identification number on the back cover.

History The route of the Roman Road called the Rykeneld Street passed very close to Stoke-on-Trent railway station. Shelton had an artisan pottery industry which was documented as early as 1685, when one Thomas Miles was producing white stone ware. Shelton had the earliest gas works in the Potteries. The works were opened in Shelton's Lower Bedford Street, under the ownership of the British Gaslight Company, to supply Hanley and Stoke in 1825. The British Pottery Manufacturer's Federation Club is a large private member's club situated in Federation House, just opposite Stoke-on-Trent railway station, and is run for the benefit of the many local pottery manufacturers. It was established in 1951, and still operates. Current profile Shelton is the home of the main Staffordshire University campus and library, which specialises in art and design teaching. The presence of a major University has resulted in the residential area having a large student population during term-time. Shelton mostly consists of Victorian terraced houses and is occupied by a combination of owner occupiers, students, and private landlords. Families tend to cluster more around the western edges of Hanley Park and around the large cemetery that stretches north into Cliff Vale. These latter two protected green spaces, along with the route of the Cauldon Canal, serve as a natural buffer between Shelton and the south of Hanley (the \\"city centre\\"). The 2001 Census defined Shelton as \\"multicultural\\". Religion (2001): *Christian 19.4% *Muslim 48.2% *Hindu 1.3% *Sikh 0.3% Staffordshire University and two colleges The Staffordshire University main campus and main library are located a few yards from Stoke-on- Trent railway station, which is a mainline station with excellent connections to Birmingham and London. Stoke-on-Trent College is also located at the northern boundary of Shelton. In September 2011 the city's Sixth Form College also moved nearby, to a new building, as part of a masterplan to create a unified educational \\"University Quarter\\" for the city. The wider Shelton area is included within this area known as the University Quarter, and has subsequently seen continuing regeneration in recent years. Within the grounds of the University is the Film Theatre, a purpose-built cinema which during term-time shows art house films. There is also a large art supplies shop that serves the many art students and which is open to the public. The University Library can be joined by members of the public for a small annual fee. Each year in June the campus becomes a huge public art and design show, as the graduates show their final work. Mainline railway station Hanley Park The large historic Victorian ornamental park called Hanley Park underwent a ¬£2.8m improvement project which was completed in 2007. The Park often plays host to Council-funded pop music events and similar summer outdoors entertainment.

In the , Deagon had a population of 3,675 people.  Geography  Deagon is north of the CBD. History The Jagera and Turrbal groups occupied land in the Brisbane and Ipswich areas. The exact boundaries are not known, however, the Turrbal generally occupied the area north of the Brisbane River. Both groups had closely related languages which are classified as belonging to the larger Yaggera language group. In nearby Shorncliffe the Ningy-Ningy clan had displaced the Turrbal by the 1850s. The area has a rich indigenous history. Evidence of Aboriginal occupation can be found; in a bora ring at Nudgee Waterhole, and in sites of special importance at Dinah Island near Nundah, and by Aboriginal camps on the banks of the Cabbage Tree Creek. The suburb was named after its railway station, which in turn was named in 1887 after William Deagon who was Mayor of Sandgate from 1882 to 1884. William Deagon was an old identity of the area, and his name was used for the locality when the railway line went through in 1887. He owned the Sandgate Hotel, a stopping place for the Cobb & Co. coaches. Deagon Street, the racecourse, the railway station and the Deagon Wetlands all bear his name. Deagon Post Office opened on 18 June 1947 at Mr Torpie's store next to the railway station. Sandgate District State High School opened in 1959. When the Minister of Education Jack Pizzey officially opened it in 1961, he said the school, which had an elaborate man-made lake in its grounds, was one of the most attractive in Queensland. Extensions were then completed four years after that. In the 1980s a performance hall and library building were added and then, in 2001‚Äì03, under the secondary school renewal program, a modern sports hall and home economics block. In , the population of Deagon was 3,460, In May 2012 the Sandgate Baptist congregation merged with the Geebung Baptist congregation and established a new church, Connect Baptist Church at 21 Braun Street, Deagon. Demographics In the , Deagon recorded a population of 3,675 people, 51.1% female and 48.9% male. The median age of the Deagon population was 42 years of age, 4 years above the Australian median. 75.7% of people living in Deagon were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were England 3.9%, New Zealand 2.2%, Philippines 0.3%, Ireland 0.3%, Germany 0.4%. 87.3% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 0.5% Tagalog, 0.4% Samoan, 0.4% Dutch, 0.4% Mandarin, 0.3% Japanese. According to the 2016 census 14.3% of Deagon residents were born overseas and 8.8% speak a language other than English at home. This compares with 28.9% for Queensland as a whole. The most common foreign languages spoken were Tagalog, Samoan, Dutch, Mandarin and Japanese. 2.5% were of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, compared to 4.0% for Queensland. Landmarks Green Pine Taoist Temple, 2007 A Queensland Racing training facility, Deagon Racecourse, lies to the north of the suburb. Horse racing in Deagon ceased in 1941, but the racecourse remains a first rate training establishment. The Bligh government intended to make the racecourse the centre for all greyhound racing in Brisbane (replacing Albion Park Raceway) but this plan was cancelled in February 2012. The Gateway Arterial Road runs through the western side of the suburb. The (Evergreen) Ching Chung Taoist Temple sits next to the Gateway Arterial Road. It was built at Deagon in 1991. There are three Halls which were built according to Taoist beliefs. The three halls are: The Hall of Three Purities, the Hall of Three Masters and the Hall of the Spiritual Garden. There is also a Memorial Hall of Ancestors. Environment Deagon has a flat topography with one of its boundaries being Cabbage Tree Creek. The Creek's catchment is largely urbanised but the Boondall Wetlands, which is separated from Deagon by the Creek, plays an important role in providing essential habitat for a range of birds and animals, including migratory birds, which make their way from the arctic circle. The Boondall Wetlands near Deagon have ecosystems that are fresh as well as areas that are salt water. The smaller reserves such as Brighton and Deagon Wetlands are fresh water only. The Deagon Wetland is an important remnant of tea tree woodland on a 50ha site. Notable bird species include the striped honeyeater and the white-cheeked honeyeater. Transport Deagon can be easily accessed via Sandgate Road and the Gateway Motorway. Deagon also has a railway line with three stations easily accessed by Deagon residents: North Boondall, Deagon, and Sandgate. Deagon also has a variety of bus services operated by Brisbane Transport and Hornibrook Bus Lines. All public transport services in Deagon are operated under Translink Including school bus services operated by Thompson Bus Lines. Local information Deagon is home to the following popular fast food outlets: * KFC, a new store opened in May 2008.

It transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast, alongside sister station WHOM. Despite primarily serving northern New Hampshire and western Maine, WPKQ's city-grade signal covers portions of New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, and Quebec. The station serves as the northern New Hampshire and Lewiston-Auburn, Maine area affiliate for the New England Patriots Radio Network. History The 103.7 frequency now occupied by WPKQ began in March 1952 as WMOU-FM, the FM sister station to WMOU (1230) in Berlin. The stations became WKCB and WKCQ in 1957, but returned to their original callsigns two years later. WMOU-FM separated from the simulcast of WMOU in 1972 and became WXLQ-FM, airing a rock and oldies format. This evolved to a mix of top 40 and oldies in 1975. The station reverted to the WMOU simulcast in 1977 (but retained the WXLQ call letters). A construction permit for a new 103.7, using WXLQ's former transmitter, was granted on August 8, 1983 to New England Broadcasting, Inc. (formed by Steve Powell, the son of previous WMOU owner Bob Powell) and revived the WMOU call letters (without the \\"-FM\\" suffix), with a license to cover issued on March 15, 1984. In 1990, the station moved its transmitter to Mount Washington in 1990, changed its format to an innovative hot AC format and officially became \\"WZPK 1-0-3-7 Peak-FM\\". Branding themselves as \\"The Peak of New England\\" with a Class C flamethrower signal that reached from Boston to Montreal. The station debuted by originally simply asking on-air to its audience what they wanted on air by airing the message \\"We are building YOUR Superstation. Please tell us what you would like to hear\\" and supplied a 1-800 number for listeners to contact the station. The station was really refreshing to Sherbrooke Qu√©bec's audience just north of the border who were then losing their own English top 40 local radio station CKTS AM 900 when WZPK made its startup. In 1996, 103.7 adopted its present callsign and format upon its sale to Fuller-Jeffrey in 1996. The city of license was changed to North Conway in 1999. On July 6, 2015, WPKQ split from its simulcast with WOKQ 97.5 FM Dover, NH and rebranded as \\"103.7 The Peak\\". In doing so, it moved its studios from WOKQ's facility in Dover to Townsquare's existing studio in Portland, alongside WBLM, WCYY, WJBQ and fellow Mount Washington broadcaster WHOM. Signal Due to its transmitter location on the top of Mount Washington, the station has one of the largest coverage areas in North America, reaching most of New Hampshire (except where WKNE comes in better), the Northeast Kingdom and other portions of Central and Northern Vermont (including Montpelier, Saint Johnsbury and Burlington), Western, Central and Southern Maine (including the Lewiston/Auburn, Augusta and Portland areas), Southern Quebec (including eastern exurbs of Montreal and the Sherbrooke/Estrie area), and small portions of northeast Massachusetts (the northernmost areas of Essex County). However, as the slogan shows, the station chooses to focus mainly on New Hampshire (specifically areas north of the Lakes Region and Maine (specifically the Western Maine Mountains tourism region and portions of greater Portland), while still getting some listenership in Estrie and the Northeast Kingdom (especially within the former, as it is the only country station audible there).

It was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany on 9 September 1928, and named for American astronomer Louis Henyey.  Orbit and classification  Henyey is a member of the Flora family, a large population of stony S-type asteroids in the inner main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,232 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first Identified as at Heidelberg in 1907. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation in 1928.  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = In August 2012, a first rotational lightcurve of Henyey was obtained from photometric observations by Daniel Klinglesmith at Etscorn Campus Observatory () in New Mexico. It gave a rotation period of 18.986 hours with a brightness variation of 0.23 magnitude (). In November 2016, a divergent period solution of 32.2 hours with a change in brightness of 0.32 magnitude was found by French amateur astronomer Ren√© Roy (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Henyey measures 10.31 and 10.96 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.26 and 0.28. respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of the family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 11.31 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.9.  Naming  Based on a suggestion by William Westbrooke, this minor planet was named after American astronomer Louis Henyey (1910‚Äì1970), known for his contributions in the field of stellar structure and stellar evolution. The lunar crater Henyey is also named in his honour. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 February 1971 ().

Since 2011, he has played lead guitar with Bon Jovi and officially replaced former lead guitarist Richie Sambora in 2016. Career In 1982, Phil formed the hard rock/heavy metal band Sidinex (naming it after himself, the moniker being his last name spelled backwards) with singer Todd Farhood, bassist Kevin Gingrinch and drummer Scott Masterson. The band released only one EP in 1985, Forever Young, before changing name to Flip City in 1987 and disbanding soon after. An opportunity in Xenidis' career came when he was asked in 1990 to tour with Randy Coven, whom he met through Aldo Nova; in 1991, he toured the US with Aldo Nova. From 1992 to 1993 he played with Triumph, recording Edge of Excess and touring with them. In 1994, Phil collaborated with Terry Brown, Doug Varty, Rob Kennedy and others to form a short lived band, The Bushdoctors, in Mississauga, Ontario. They recorded one album, a self-titled debut, now out of print. Also in 1994 he played a guitar solo for Our Lady Peace‚Äôs song ‚ÄúDenied‚Äù from the album Naveed. Phil X was guitarist for US power pop band Powder alongside vocalist and then-wife Ninette Terhart. The band released three albums between 2002 and 2008.https://www.discogs.com/artist/2886316-Powder-11https://www.allmusic.com/artist/powder- mn0000360530/biography Phil X is a prolific session guitarist, having played on albums by Tommy Lee, Methods of Mayhem, Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, Orianthi, Rob Zombie, Chris Daughtry, Alice Cooper, Thousand Foot Krutch and many others.

Phil X was featured in the \\"making of\\" bonus features for the movie Josie and the Pussycats. He acted as a music coach for the film and taught the young actresses to appear as if they were actually playing their instruments. =Bon Jovi (2011-present)= left In 2011, Phil X substituted for Bon Jovi's lead guitarist Richie Sambora, who missed 13 dates after entering rehab, and later filled in for Sambora on the US and Europe leg of the 2013 tour after Sambora left the band suddenly due to personal reasons. It was a mutual friend between Phil X and Jon Bon Jovi, Arman Ghasemi who recommended to Jon Bon Jovi to use Phil X as a substitute. In mid-2013 he filled in for Sambora during a number of dates of the Because We Can tour, including their only Italian date in Milan, the entire British leg of the tour including the Isle of Wight Festival and Hyde Park BST dates, the South African leg, the South American leg, and the Australian leg of the tour. In 2016, Phil became an official member in the band along with bass guitarist Hugh McDonald and also features as guitarist for the band on their single, \\"This House Is Not for Sale\\" on the album of the same name as well as their latest studio effort Bon Jovi: 2020.

Equipment =Guitars= Phil X has used many guitars during his session and live work. He prefers bridge pickups and often removes the neck pickup from his personal guitars for added vibration, clarity and harmonics. For humorous effect, he will usually place an action figure and fan grille in the pickup cavity.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0VZzNXiXO8&t;=1s He also favors P-90 pickups due to their tonal flexibility; their tone can be cleaned up on an overdriven amp by simply lowering the volume on the guitar. His most notable guitar is his ESP LTD Viper, which he refers to as the \\"sticker guitar\\". This guitar originally had a Seymour Duncan JB pickuphttps://farm3.static.flickr.com/2486/3873460790_02e764e086.jpg and later a Gibson P-94, but it has since been replaced with an Arcane PX-100.https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/c6/ee/c5c6ee679514a8edcb47e6b117e828df.jpg In 2012, Phil X received a signature guitar from Yamaha, in 2015 followed the release of a signature XG model made by Framus.

At the suburb recorded a population of 5,313.  Geography  Sherwood is south west of the Brisbane CBD and borders the Brisbane River. The suburb is mostly low and medium-density housing with a retail strip centred along Sherwood Road.  History  On 24 October 1885 auctioneer John F. Buckland offered 268 suburban blocks (mostly 16 perches) in the Township of Sherwood Estate. Most of the blocks were in the area bounded by Oxley Road to the west, Sherwood Road to the north and the Corinda‚ÄìYeerongpilly railway line to the south-east. The remaining blocks were south of the railway line on Railway Terrace. However, only about 40 blocks were sold. On 23 June 1888 auctioneer John F. Buckland offered the remaining 200 suburban blocks in the Township of Sherwood Estate. In 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891 parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the suburb of Sherwood. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. On Saturday 17 March 1928 Herbert Hoare in conjunction with auctioneer Norman C. Cosssart offered 8 suburban sites in the Sherwood Station Estate, which was bounded by Dewar Terrace to the west, Station Street (now Marlborough Street) to the north and Honour Avenue to the west (and north of Lilly Street). The land was formerly the home of judge Pope Alexander Cooper who died in 1923. At the suburb recorded a population of 5,313. Heritage listings Sherwood Arboretum wetlands, 2014 Sherwood has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 464 Oxley Road: Sherwood State School * Sherwood Road: Berry and MacFarlane Monument * 39A Turner Street: Sherwood Arboretum, a large botanical garden and lake fronting the river which was planned and landscaped in the 1920s. Commercial area Sherwood Road and shops There are a number of cafes, both a BWS and Liquorland liquor store, a Fitness center, a Bank of Queensland branch, Op shops, and a Woolworths supermarket.

The Sherwood Arboretum is on the western side of the suburb, bordering the Brisbane River. Hives park borders the Ipswich line on the southern end of the suburb, and contains a Girl Guides building. Thomas Street Park and Strickland Terrace Park is on the eastern end of the suburb, bordering the Oxley Creek. The Stewart Franklin Park is a small park on the southern border of the suburb, next to the Tennyson line. Transport Sherwood railway station, 2017 The suburb is serviced by the Sherwood railway station which links Ipswich and the Springfield Central lines to the Brisbane central business district. Bus services along Oxley Road link the Centenary suburbs to Indooroopilly and the Great Circle Line service passes through the suburb. Education Sherwood State School, established in 1867 is one of the oldest schools in the state and still has preserved many of its original timber buildings. Sherwood State School was originally known as West Oxley State School and opened on 25 March 1867 (other records indicate 23 March). The first head teacher (Headmaster) appointed to the school was Major William Jenyns Boyd. He was born in Paris in 1842 and migrated to Australia in 1862. In 1868, Oliver Radcliffe was the first name on the roll as a pupil teacher. He became a teacher, a headmaster and then a school inspector. By his retirement in 1932, he was the Chief Inspector for the Queensland Education Department. He personally inspected schools from Coolangatta to Thursday Island and from Rockhampton to the border with South Australia.

Ricouxas observation arc begins with its official discovery observation in 1906, as no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made.  Physical characteristics  = Rotation and poles = In the 1990s, Italian astronomer Maria A. Barucci obtained a rotational lightcurve of Ricouxa, using the ESO 1-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 10.438 hours with a brightness variation of 0.62 magnitude (). Photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini in April 2006, gave a similar period of 10.033 hours and an identical amplitude of 0.62 magnitude (). Additional periods were derived on modeled light-curves from various data sources. They gave a period of 10.42466 and 10.42468 hours, as well as a spin axis of (0¬∞, 71.0¬∞) and (251.0¬∞, 75.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates, respectively. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Ricouxa measures 7.78 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.228 (revised albedo-fits per 2014), while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì taken from 8 Flora, the family's principal body and namesake ‚Äì and derives a diameter of 7.07 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.92.

The Heidelberg Observatory is a direct successor to the old Mannheim Observatory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 February 1976 ().  Physical characteristics  = Slow rotator = Photometric observations taken in 2006 and 2011, by Adri√°n Gal√°d and by the Palomar Transient Factory, showed a leisurely rotation period of 105.745 and hours with a brightness variation of and 0.46 magnitude, respectively (). While most asteroids rotate within 20 hours once around their axis, Barry belongs to the relatively small group of slow rotators with a period above 100 hours. It may have a non-principal axis rotation. However, no follow-up measurements have since confirmed its tumbling motion. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Barry measures between 9.21 and 9.50 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.216 and 0.330, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.280 and a diameter of 9.54 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.1.

They were among the earliest merchants to arrive in Singapore when it was established as a trading port by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819. They numbered around 100 individuals at their peak in the early 1920s, but most have moved on to other countries or become absorbed into the wider Singapore community. Despite their small number, they had an impact in the commercial life of early Singapore, and members of the community co-founded the newspaper The Straits Times and built the Raffles Hotel. The Armenian Apostolic Church of St Gregory the Illuminator on Armenian Street, the second church to be built in Singapore, is today the oldest surviving one. History The early Armenians of Singapore had their origin in Julfa, whose population were deported to Isfahan (forming New Julfa) by Shah Abbas of Persia after he captured the city in 1603. Some of these Armenians then migrated to India and further beyond, and by the 18th century, Armenian communities had established themselves in India (particularly Kolkata), Myanmar, the Malay Peninsula (particularly Penang and Malacca), and Java. Soon after Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore as a trading port in 1819, Armenian merchants arrived in Singapore. The first census of Singapore in 1824 showed 16 Armenians, and the 1826 census showed that there were 16 male and 3 female Armenians in Singapore. Although small in number, the Armenians were active in the commercial activity of early Singapore. Armenian trading firms such as Sarkies and Moses (1840-1914), Apcar & Stephens (1826-1845) and Mackertich M. Moses (1820s-1839) were prominent in Singapore's economy. By the 1830s, Armenian merchants began investing in land. In March 1836 the Church of St Gregory the Illuminator was consecrated, making it the second church in Singapore. There were around a hundred individuals in the early 1920s but the number declined. The 1931 census showed 81 Armenians, although actual numbers were around 95. Many of the Armenians, being British subjects, were forcibly interned by the Japanese during World War II. By the 1950s, much of the local Armenian community had emigrated to Australia or become part of the larger communities in Singapore. Nevertheless, during the Feast of the Epiphany, the flags of Singapore and Armenia are still raised at the Armenian church. Armenians today The Armenian community in Singapore remains small. There are around a dozen families in Singapore who are descended from the early immigrant families: Aviet, Carapiet, Galestin, Galistan, Johannes, Moses, Sarkies, and Zechariah. In the 2000s, some Armenians have emigrated from Armenia to Singapore. Notable Armenians Catchick Moses (Movessian) (1812-1895), was a co-founder of the Straits Times, which was to become the national English newspaper, in 1845. He sold the paper a year later because it was unprofitable. The Sarkies brothers (Martin, Tigran, Aviet and Arshak) founded the Raffles Hotel and several other hotels in Southeast Asia, including Eastern Oriental Hotel in Penang, Malaysia and Strand Hotel in Yangon, Myanmar (previously known as Rangoon, Burma). The brothers' cousin Arathoon Sarkies managed the Adelphi Hotel. Sarkies Road is named after his wife Regina Sarkies (n√©e Carapiet). Their direct descendants still reside in Singapore. Martyrose Arathoon who became a partner in Sarkies Brothers in 1917 managed Raffles Hotel during its halycon days of the 1920s. Agnes Joaquim (Hovakimian) born in Singapore on 7 April 1854, hybridised the orchid named Vanda Miss Joaquim by Henry Ridley. In 1899 at a flower show, Agnes unveiled the Vanda Miss Joaquim for the first time, and won the $12 first prize for her flower. As she was suffering from cancer at that time, Agnes died 3 months later at the same year, at the age of 44. In 1981, the Vanda Miss Joaquim was designated Singapore's national flower. Her tombstone stands in the Armenian Church in Singapore and reads: Agnes' younger brother Joaquim P. Joaquim (1856-1902) became one of Singapore's most prominent criminal lawyers. He served as president of the Municipal Council, member of the Legislative Council, and Vice-Consul for the USA. George Seth, born in 1877 was Solicitor-General of the Straits Settlements in the 1920s. Emile Galistan, born 1881 was domiciled in Singapore. Galistan owned an extensive collection of orchids and was master at growing them, and he freely shared his knowledge of growing orchids with his regular contributions of articles to the Malayan Orchid Review, the journal of the Malayan Orchid Society that was founded in 1931. He was elected an honorary member of the Society in 1958. Galistan Avenue in Singapore was named after, which recognizes the work of Emile Galistan of the Singapore Improvement Trust.

They were originally part of a nationwide effort during the Civil Rights Movement to organize African Americans to achieve social, political and economic equality in the United States. The most prominent example of Freedom Schools was in Mississippi during the summer of 1964. Origins Despite the Supreme Court's ruling of 1954 in the Brown v. Board of Education case striking down segregated school systems, in the mid-1960s Mississippi still maintained separate and unequal white and \\"colored\\" school systems. On average, the state spent $81.66 to educate a white student compared to only $21.77 for a black child. Mississippi was one of only two states in the union that did not have a mandatory education law and many children in rural areas were sent to work in the fields and received little education at all. Even the curriculum was different for white and black. As a typical example, the white school board of Bolivar County mandated that \\"Neither foreign languages nor civics shall be taught in Negro schools. Nor shall American history from 1860 to 1875 be taught.\\" In late 1963, Charles Cobb, Charles E. Cobb Jr. biography a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) activist, proposed the organization sponsor a network of Freedom Schools, inspired by examples of the concept used previously in other cities. In the summer of 1963, the county board of education in Prince Edward County, Virginia had closed the public schools rather than integrate them after having been sued in a case following Brown vs. Board of Education, and so Freedom Schools emerged in their stead. In September, 1963, about 3,000 students participated in a Stay Out for Freedom protest in Boston opting instead to attend community-organized Freedom Schools. On October 22, 1963, known as Freedom Day, more than 200,000 students boycotted the Chicago Public Schools to protest segregation and poor school conditions, with some attending Freedom Schools instead. Subsequently, on February 3, 1964 in a similar Freedom day protest, over 450,000 students participated in a boycott of the New York City public schools in what was the largest civil rights demonstration of the 1960s, and up to 100,000 students attended alternative Freedom Schools. Mississippi Freedom Schools The Mississippi Freedom Schools were developed as part of the 1964 Freedom Summer civil rights project, a massive effort that focused on voter registration drives and educating Mississippi students for social change. The Council of Federated Organizations (COFO)--an umbrella civil rights organization of activists and funds drawn from SNCC, CORE, NAACP, and SCLC--among other organizations, coordinated Freedom Summer. The project was essentially a statewide voter registration campaign, and the framers called for one thousand volunteers to assist in the undertaking. Activists made plans to conduct a parallel Democratic primary election, because the systematic exclusion of black voters resulted in all-white delegations to presidential primaries. These efforts culminated in the creation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Both the official delegation and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party went to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In December 1963, during planning for the upcoming Freedom Summer project, Charles Cobb proposed a network of \\"Freedom Schools\\" that would foster political participation among Mississippi elementary and high school students, in addition to offering academic courses and discussions. Activists organizing the Freedom Summer project accepted Cobb's proposal and in March 1964 organized a curriculum planning conference in New York under the sponsorship of the National Council of Churches. Spelman College history professor Staughton Lynd was appointed Director of the Freedom School program. Over the course of Freedom Summer, more than 40 Freedom Schools were set up in black communities throughout Mississippi. The purpose was to try to end political displacement of African Americans by encouraging students to become active citizens and socially involved within the community. Over 3,000 African American students attended these schools in the summer of 1964. Students ranged in age from small children to the very elderly with the average approximately 15 years old. Teachers were volunteers, most of whom were college students themselves.Freedom Schools ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans Political and educational objectives The Freedom Schools were conceptualized with both political and educational objectives. Freedom School teachers would educate elementary and high school students to become social change agents that would participate in the ongoing Civil Rights Movement, most often in voter registration efforts. The curriculum adopted was divided into seven core areas that analyzed the social, political, and economic context of precarious race relations and the Civil Rights Movement. Leadership development was encouraged, in addition to more traditional academic skills. The education at Freedom Schools was student-centered and culturally relevant. Curriculum and instruction was based on the needs of the students, discussion among students and teachers (rather than lecturing) was encouraged, and curriculum planners encouraged teachers to base instruction on the experiences of their students. Curriculum Curriculum development revolved around The Curriculum Conference, which consisted of teachers and directors discussing the type of education that would be taught at the freedom schools. The teachers were to write an outline for their curriculum planning. They were told to keep in mind what life was like in Mississippi and the short amount of time that they had to teach the material. The curriculum had to be teacher- friendly and immediately useful to the students, while being based on questions and activities. The primary focus was questions and discussion rather than memorization of facts and dates. Instructions to teachers included: :In the matter of classroom procedure, questioning is the vital tool. It is meaningless to flood the student with information he cannot understand; questioning is the path to enlightenment... The value of the Freedom Schools will derive mainly from what the teachers are able to elicit from the students in terms of comprehension and expression of their experiences. Since the curriculum conference brought together citizens of different backgrounds and origins, the final curriculum outline incorporated material from different origins and consisted of three different sections. The three sections of the Freedom School curriculum were the Academic Curriculum, the Citizenship Curriculum, and the Recreational Curriculum. The purpose of these sections was to teach students social change within the school; regional history; black history; how to answer open-ended questions; and the development of academic skills. The Academic Curriculum consisted of reading, writing, and verbal activities that were based on the student's own experiences. The Citizenship Curriculum was to encourage the students to ask questions about the society. The Recreational Curriculum required the student to be physically active. In most of the schools, the Citizenship Curriculum focused on two sets of inter-related questions for class discussion: : Why are we (teachers and students) in Freedom Schools? : What is the Freedom Movement? : What alternatives does the Freedom Movement offer us? : What does the majority culture have that we want? : What does the majority culture have that we don't want? : What do we have that we want to keep? First year Freedom Schools opened during the first week of July 1964, after approximately 250 Freedom School volunteer teachers attended one-week training sessions at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio. The original plans had anticipated 25 Freedom Schools and 1,000 students; by the end of the summer, 41 schools had been opened to over 2,500 students. Freedom Schools were established with the help and commitment of local communities, who provided various buildings for schools and housing for the volunteer teachers. While some of the schools were held in parks, kitchens, residential homes, and under trees, most classes were held in churches or church basements. Attendance varied throughout the summer. Some schools experienced consistent attendance, but that was the exception. Because attendance was not compulsory, recruitment and maintaining attendance was perhaps the primary challenge the schools faced. In Clarksdale, Mississippi, for instance, the average student attendance during the first week was fifteen, the second week was eight, but at any point during the summer the school may have had in attendance as many as thirty-five students. It was not uncommon for adults to attend class regularly. Instruction was changed based on local conditions. In rural communities where students were expected to work during the school day, classes were often held at night. In schools that maintained traditional school hours, typically in urban areas, citizenship curriculum and traditional academic courses were offered in the morning and special classes such as music, drama, and typing were offered in the afternoon. In many instances, entire school days would be devoted to voter registration efforts. It was imperative for SNCC activists that students would be invested in civil rights activity because this cadre of students was expected to remain in the state to enact social change. At the conclusion of the Freedom School term, activists and students organized a student-led conference on August 8, 1964, the day after the funeral of James Chaney, one of the victims in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. The conference was held in Meridian, Mississippi, at the former Meridian Baptist Seminary. The school was described as \\"the palace of the Freedom School circuit.\\" Each Freedom School sent three representatives to the conference to form a youth platform for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. The student delegates discussed issues related to jobs, schools, foreign affairs, and public accommodations and proffered recommendations for the state party. By the end of the conference, students prepared a statement that demanded access to public accommodations, building codes for each home, integrated schools, a public works program, and the appointment of qualified blacks to state positions. Freedom School teachers and students remained committed to the Freedom School concept. In early August 1964, plans were being made to continue the Freedom Schools during the upcoming school year, and some volunteer teachers had already agreed to stay. Students decided, however, during the Freedom School Conference in early August to not continue the schools. Yet students implemented the leadership and activism experienced during the summer in their own schools. Some students returned to school and demanded better facilities and more courses. Students in Philadelphia, Mississippi, returned to school wearing SNCC \\"One Man, One Vote\\" buttons--for which they were expelled. Freedom Library Day School, Philadelphia The Philadelphia Freedom Library was founded by John E. Churchville in 1964. Over the next few years he began to offer evening classes and eventually converted the library into a school. Upon the founding of this school, he prepared a short set of essays which were published in the book, What Black Educators Are Saying, edited by Nathan Wright Jr. and published in 1970. This essay includes much of Churchville's thoughts on the state of the Black Power movement as well as his ideas for the pedagogy of his new Freedom School. He denigrates the ideas of both the cultural and progressive nationalist movements as being facades and without teeth. For him, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement which called for total and complete revolution both here and everywhere on earth, was the most accurate and true to its principles. They identified both intragroup and intraindividual issues facing black people in America and the only way to truly become a revolutionary was to be born-again; acted on by an outside power which began to rid you of these deficiencies. The schools themselves were based on a simple set of priorities. If education is the indoctrination of the young into a ideological system, then the Freedom School must reeducate black children to reject the dominant ideology and construct a new system. To do this, the first element of pedagogy to be established must be the new ideology of the school. After this, teachers must be found who can bridge the gap between identity and alienation, being object lessons for their students both inside and outside the classroom. Finally, the curriculum was designed to explain the objective situation of black people and teach the tools and skills to deal with this reality. The curriculum as described by Churchville was merely a vehicle for teaching revolutionary truth; the content was mostly irrelevant as it was the analysis which would demonstrate the reality. The school was raided by the FBI on August 13, 1966 on suspicion of harboring militant groups. After the raid, Churchville dropped out of activism. Legacy Part of the Freedom School legacy can be seen in the schools that hold the name today: Akwesasne Freedom School on a Mohawk Indian reservation; The Freedom Schools in St. Louis, Missouri and Chicago, Illinois, the Tyree Scott Freedom School in Seattle, Washington, and the Paulo Freire Freedom School in Tucson, Arizona. The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) operates a nationwide modern Freedom School program. This program is coordinated through the Children's Defense Fund's Black Community Crusade for Children initiative. The CDF Freedom Schools national program operates over 130 summer program sites in 24 states across the country serving nearly 12,000 children. In Michigan the Black Radical Congress in Detroit launched a campaign to create a model based on the Freedom Schools. Philadelphia Freedom Schools is an independent community education initiative operating a modern version of the Mississippi curriculum with an emphasis on academic scholarship, social action and intergenerational leadership. Philadelphia Freedom Schoolshttp://www.philadelphiafreedomschools.blogs.com are organized through a lead agency, Communities In Schools.http://www.cisphl.org Atlanta's Freedom University, a modern day freedom school and only school in the world where all students are undocumented immigrants, offers a tuition-free, liberatory college curriculum that helps undocumented youth access higher education.

Early life Anthony Indelicato is the son of Alphonse \\"Sonny Red\\" Indelicato, a powerful capo in the Bonanno family. Anthony Indelicato's wife is Catherine Burke, a daughter of Lucchese crime family associate Jimmy Burke. In 1979, Anthony Indelicato participated in the murder of Bonanno boss Carmine Galante. With the official Bonanno boss Philip Rastelli in prison, Galante had taken effective control of the family in the early 1970s. His ruthlessness and ambition created many enemies within the Bonanno family and in the other New York families.Raab, pp. 203‚Äì205 The Mafia Commission finally allowed several Bonanno capos to plot Galante's assassination. On July 12, 1979, Galante entered Joe and Mary's Italian- American Restaurant in Bushwick, Brooklyn for lunch. Three gunmen murdered Galante at his table as he was eating lunch on the patio of the restaurant. As a reward for his involvement in killing Galante, Indelicato was promoted to capo. Three capos murder After Galante's murder, a power struggle erupted between two factions of the Bonanno family. One faction included capos Dominick Napolitano and Joseph Massino, who were loyal to Rastelli. The second faction, which included Indelicato's father Alphonse, Philip Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera, wanted to murder the leaders of the Massino faction and assume power for themselves. After receiving permission from the Mafia Commission, Massino set up a plot to murder the rival captains first. Napolitano later contacted undercover agent Donnie Brasco, whom he hoped to make a made man,DeStefano 2007, pp. 112, 117 to murder Indelicato, who had previously evaded death after missing a meeting which left his father, Giaccone, and Trinchera dead on May 5, 1981. After his father's murder, Indelicato went into hiding in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Massino wanted to kill him also, but he had missed the meeting. His father brought Lino instead, who was the sole survivor of the massacre. Lino, who had escaped, was quickly won over to Massino's side.Raab, p. 615 Napolitano assigned associate Donnie Brasco, whom he hoped to make a made man, to kill Indelicato.DeStefano 2007, pp. 112, 117 \\"Brasco\\", however, was in fact an undercover FBI agent named Joseph Pistone; shortly after the hit was ordered, Pistone's assignment was ended and Napolitano was informed of their infiltration.DeStefano 2007, pp. 118‚Äì120 Mafia Commission Trial and prison On November 19, 1986, Indelicato was convicted of the 1979 Galante murder during the historic Mafia Commission Trial.

It was discovered on 1 November 1905, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, and later named after American astrophysicist Donald Howard Menzel.  Classification and orbit  Menzel is a stony S-type asteroid that orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,219 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first used observation at Goethe Link Observatory in 1965, or 60 years after its official discovery, with a number of unused observations previously made at Heidelberg.  Naming  This minor planet was named after American astrophysicist Donald Howard Menzel (1901‚Äì1976), who was the director of the Harvard College Observatory and a pioneer in theoretical and observational astrophysics. Menzel, a mentor of several prolific astronomers, calculated Atomic Transition Probabilities, analysed the composition of stars from their spectra, studied the physics of gaseous nebulae and the Sun's chromosphere, observed solar eclipses, and measured the rotation period of Uranus and Neptune by means of spectroscopy. Menzel was also popular for debunking UFO sightings. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 April 1977 ().  Physical characteristics  Between September 2005 and November 2015, a total of least 10 rotational lightcurves were obtained for this asteroid from photometric observations from several observatories all over the world. They all gave a concurring, well-defined rotation period of 2.83‚Äì2.84 hours with a brightness variation between 0.24 and 0.39 magnitude.(). According to the space-based survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Menzel measures between 9.6 and 10.2 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.21 and 0.25. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives a typical albedo for stony asteroids of 0.21 and a diameter of 10.1 kilometers, with an absolute magnitude of 12.25.

The freeway removal policy resulted in the demolition of the Park East Freeway, the only section to have been completed. Route The planned eastern terminus of the Park Freeway in downtown Milwaukee was near Prospect Avenue and Ogden Avenue. At that point, the freeway was to turn southward as the Lake Freeway. The Park East Freeway, as built, extended from Jefferson Street westward to Interstate 43, carrying Highway 145. From I-43, the Park West Freeway was to continue northwesterly to just north of North Avenue. From there, it would continue westward to its intersection with the Stadium Freeway. History The right of way for the entire Park Freeway was purchased and cleared. However, only a small portion was ever built - between North 12th Street and North Jefferson Street. Because of opposition of the freeway by community leaders, the remainder of the freeway was never built, and the right of way lay vacant for years. Much of the land has been redeveloped or designated as urban prairie parkland. The only built portion was demolished beginning in 2002, most of which was replaced by an improved at-grade West McKinley Avenue and East Knapp Street and a new vertical-lift bridge over the Milwaukee River. Redevelopment of the cleared freeway right-of-way was slowed by the economic recession that started in 2008. Milwaukee School of Engineering constructed an athletic facility. Commercial developments include an ALOFT Hotel and offices. The footprint of the freeway also contains the Fiserv Forum arena, the replacement for the Bradley Center, along with additional buildings, a practice facility, and entertainment properties encompassing the Milwaukee Bucks's Deer District. Development has occurred on land adjacent to the former right-of-way, which is no longer overshadowed by the elevated freeway.

Judo was the first Japanese martial art to gain widespread international recognition, and the first to become an official Olympic sport. Pedagogical innovations attributed to Kan≈ç include the use of black and white belts, and the introduction of dan ranking to show the relative ranking among members of a martial art style. Well-known mottoes attributed to Kan≈ç include \\"maximum efficiency with minimum effort\\" ( seiryoku zen'y≈ç) and \\"mutual welfare and benefit\\" ( jita ky≈çei). In his professional life, Kan≈ç was an educator. Important postings included serving as director of primary education for the from 1898 to 1901, and as president of Tokyo Higher Normal School from 1900 until 1920.Strictly speaking, the name was Tokyo Normal School from 1901 until 1903, and Tokyo Higher Normal School from 1903 to 1924. Tokyo Higher Normal School is today viewed as an ancestor of the Institute of Health and Sport Sciences at University of Tsukuba. See the Institute of Health and Sport Science's web site He played a key role in making judo and kendo part of the Japanese public school programs of the 1910s. Kan≈ç was also a pioneer of international sports. Accomplishments included being the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) (he served from 1909 until 1938); officially representing Japan at most Olympic Games held between 1912 and 1936; and serving as a leading spokesman for Japan's bid for the 1940 Olympic Games. His official honors and decorations included the First Order of Merit and Grand Order of the Rising Sun and the Third Imperial Degree. Kan≈ç was inducted as the first member of the International Judo Federation (IJF) Hall of Fame on 14 May 1999.\\"Judo founder named 1st member of IJF Hall of Fame\\", Kyodo World News Service. Early years Kan≈ç as a child (right) Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç was born to a sake-brewing family in the town of Mikage, Japan (now within Higashinada-ku, Kobe) on 10 December 1860 (the 28th day of the 10th month of the Man'en era, thus leading to his birthday being celebrated on October 28thBy the time of Kan≈ç's birth, Japan used a lunar calendar, therefore the days and months did not match the Gregorian calendar‚Äîthe Japanese only switched to a Gregorian calendar-based system in 1873. Kano was born in the first (and only) year of the Man'en era, on the 28th day of the 10th month (j≈´gatsu), which actually corresponds to December 10,1860 in the Gregorian calendar. That is why his birthday is celebrated in Japan on October 28th, the rest of the world following suit. And this is how Jigoro Kano's date of birth and birthday are on separate dates.). The family sake brands included \\"Hakushika\\", \\"Hakutsuru\\", and \\"Kiku-Masamune\\". But Kan≈ç's father Kan≈ç Jir≈çsaku (n√©e Mareshiba Jir≈çsaku) was an adopted son and he did not go into the family business. Instead he worked as a lay priest and as a senior clerk for a shipping line. Kan≈ç's father was a great believer in the power of education, and he provided Jigor≈ç, his third son, with an excellent education. The boy's early teachers included the neo-Confucian scholars Yamamoto Chikuun and Akita Shusetsu. Kan≈ç's mother died when the boy was nine years old, and his father moved the family to Tokyo. The young Kan≈ç was enrolled in private schools, and had his own English language tutor. In 1874 he was sent to a private school run by Europeans to improve his English and German language skills. At the time of his adolescence, Kan≈ç stood but weighed only . He was frequently bullied at school due to this small size and his intellectual nature, to the point other students dragged him out of the school buildings to beat him, so he wished he were stronger in order to defend himself. One day, Nakai Baisei (a friend of the family who was a member of the sh≈çguns guard), mentioned that j≈´jutsu was an excellent form of physical training, and showed Kan≈ç a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Seeing potential for self-defense on this, Kan≈ç decided he wanted to learn the art, despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and dangerous. Kan≈ç's father also discouraged him from j≈´jutsu, as he ignored the bullying his son suffered, but after noting Kan≈ç's deep interest on the art, he allowed him to train on condition Kan≈ç would strive to master it. J≈´jutsu Kan≈ç demonstrated j≈´jutsu for Ulysses S. Grant when the former U.S. president visited Japan in 1879. When Kan≈ç attended the Tokyo Imperial University in 1877, he started looking for j≈´jutsu teachers.The Father of Judo: A Biography of Jigoro Kano by Brian N. Watson, pages 29 and 189. He first looked for bonesetters, called seifukushi. His assumption was that doctors who knew the martial art were better teachers. His search brought him to Yagi Teinosuke, who had been a student of Emon Isomata in the Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ school of j≈´jutsu. Yagi, in turn, referred Kan≈ç to Fukuda Hachinosuke, a bonesetter who taught Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ in a 10-mat room adjacent to his practice. Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ was itself a combination of two older schools: the Y≈çshin-ry≈´ and Shin no Shind≈ç-ry≈´. Fukuda's training method consisted mostly of the student taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand the mechanics of the technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors. Kan≈ç had trouble defeating Fukushima Kanekichi, who was one of his seniors at the school. Therefore, Kan≈ç started trying unfamiliar techniques on his rival. He first tried techniques from sumo taught by a former practitioner named Uchiyama Kisoemon. When these did not help, he studied more, and tried a technique (\\"fireman's carry\\") that he learned from a book on western wrestling. This worked, and kataguruma, or \\"shoulder wheel\\", remains part of the judo repertoire, although at this moment the judo organizations of some countries prohibit this throw in competition judo. On 5 August 1879, Kan≈ç participated in a j≈´jutsu demonstration given for former United States president Ulysses S. Grant. This demonstration took place at the home of the prominent businessman Shibusawa Eiichi. Other people involved in this demonstration included the j≈´jutsu teachers Fukuda Hachinosuke and Iso Masatomo, and Kan≈ç's training partner Godai Ryusaku. Fukuda died soon after this demonstration, at the age of 52.https://judoinfo.com/kano5/ Kan≈ç began studying with Iso, who had been a friend of Fukuda. Despite being 62 years old and standing only tall, Iso had gained a powerful build from jujitsu training. He was known for excellence in kata, and was also a specialist in atemi, or the striking of vital areas. In Iso's method, one began with kata and then progressed to free fighting (randori). Due to Kan≈ç's intense practice and his solid grounding in the jujitsu taught by Fukuda, he was soon an assistant at Iso's school. In 1881, Fukuda's widow gave the scrolls of the school to Kan≈ç, then 21 years old. Some popular works suggest that Kan≈ç obtained a teaching license in this school, but this has not been documented: no Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ certificate(s) with Kan≈ç's name visible is depicted anywhere in the K≈çd≈çkan museum or in any published source. Neither is such rank specified in any authentic Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ archival documents. While under Iso's tutelage, Kan≈ç witnessed a demonstration by the Y≈çshin-ry≈´ j≈´jutsu teacher Totsuka Hikosuke and later took part in randori with members of Totsuka's school. Kan≈ç was impressed by the Y≈çshin-ry≈´ practitioners and realized that he might never be able to beat someone as talented as Totsuka simply by training harder: he also needed to train smarter. It was this experience that first led Kan≈ç to believe that to be truly superior, one needed to combine the best elements of several ry≈´, or schools, of j≈´jutsu including Yagyu Shingan-ry≈´ Taijutsu. Toward this end, he began to seek teachers who could provide him with superior elements of j≈´jutsu that he could adopt. After Iso died in 1881, Kan≈ç began training in Kit≈ç-ry≈´ with Iikubo Tsunetoshi (K≈çnen). Iikubo was an expert in kata and throwing, and fond of randori. Kan≈ç applied himself thoroughly to learning Kit≈ç-ry≈´, believing Iikubo's throwing techniques in particular to be better than in the schools he had previously studied. It is Iikubo who issued Kan≈ç's only verified j≈´jutsu rank and teaching credential, namely a certificate of Menkyo (not Menkyo kaiden) in Nihonden Kit≈ç J≈´d≈ç, dated October 1883. Kodokan judo =Establishment= , written in Kanji. During the early 1880s, there was no clear separation between the j≈´jutsu that Kan≈ç was teaching and the j≈´jutsu that his teachers had taught in the past. Kan≈ç's Kit≈ç-ry≈´ teacher, Iikubo Tsunetoshi, came to Kan≈ç's classes two or three times a week to support Kan≈ç's teaching. Eventually student and master began to exchange places, and Kan≈ç began to defeat Iikubo during randori: To name his system, Kan≈ç revived a term that Terada Kan'emon, the fifth headmaster of the Kit≈ç-ry≈´, had adopted when he founded his own style, the Jikishin-ry≈´: \\"j≈´d≈ç\\". The name combined the characters , meaning \\"pliancy\\", and d≈ç, which is literally \\"The Way\\", but figuratively meaning 'method.'Waterhouse, David. \\"Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç and the Beginnings of the J≈´d≈ç Movement\\", Toronto, symposium, 1982, pp. 170‚Äì171.Draeger, Donn F. Martial Arts and Ways of Japan: Volume II; Classical Budo and Bujutsu. Weatherhill, Tokyo, 1973. From a technical standpoint, Kan≈ç combined the throwing techniques of the Kit≈ç-ry≈´ and the choking and pinning techniques of the Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´. As such, judo's Koshiki no Kata preserves the traditional forms of the Kit≈ç-ry≈´ with only minor differences from the mainline tradition. Similarly, many of the techniques (but not the forms) of the Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ are preserved in the Kime no Kata. Kan≈ç's initial work was influenced by various methods and institutions. As he wrote in 1898, \\"By taking together all the good points I had learned of the various schools and adding thereto my own inventions and discoveries, I devised a new system for physical culture and moral training as well as for winning contests.\\" However, after judo was introduced into the Japanese public schools, a process that took place between 1906 and 1917, there was increasing standardization of kata and tournament technique. =Development= Statue of Kan≈ç Jigoro outside the Kodokan Institute in Tokyo Kan≈ç also oversaw the development and growth of his judo organization, the Kodokan Judo Institute. This was a remarkable effort in itself, as the Kodokan's enrollment grew from fewer than a dozen students in 1882 to more than a thousand dan-graded members by 1911.According to data presented by Yokoyama Sakujiro, in 1911, the Kodokan had two members ranked 7th dan, three members ranked 6th dan, six members ranked 5th dan, 30 members ranked 4th dan, 120 members ranked 3rd dan, 300 members ranked 2nd dan, and 750 ranked 1st dan. Source: Paul Nurse, \\"The Beginnings of Kodokan Jud≈ç: 1882‚Äì1938\\", unpublished manuscript, 1983. In May or June 1882, Kan≈ç started the Kodokan dojo with twelve mats, in space belonging to the , a Buddhist temple in what was then the Shitaya ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of Tait≈ç ward), with Iikubo attending the d≈çj≈ç three days a week to help teach.For location of Eisho-ji temple, see: Japan Times, 30 March 1913; see also Kodokan. Kan≈ç had only a handful of students at this time, but they improved their technique through regular contests with local police j≈´jutsu teams.Abel, Laszlo. \\"The Meiji Period Police Bujutsu Competitions: Judo versus Jujutsu\\", JMAS Newsletter, December 1984, v. 2:3, pp. 10‚Äì14..Muromoto, Wayne. \\"Judo's Decisive Battle: The Great Tournament Between Kodokan Judo's Four Heavenly Lords and the Jujutsu Masters\\", Furyu: The Budo Journal, v. 3.Holmes, Ben. \\"Shiro Saigo: Judo's Secret Weapon?\\" The Kodokan moved to a 60-mat space in April 1890.For dates, see Kodokan. In December 1893, the Kodokan started moving to a larger space located in Tomizaka-cho, Koishikawa-cho, and the move was completed by February 1894. The Kodokan's first kangeiko, or winter training, took place at the Tomizaka-cho dojo during the winter of 1894‚Äì1895. Midsummer training, or shochugeiko, started in 1896. \\"In order to inure the pupil to the two extremes of heat and cold and to cultivate the virtue of perseverance\\", Britain's E.J. Harrison wrote:Harrison, E.J. The Fighting Spirit of Japan. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press, 1982, p. 50. During the late 1890s, the Kodokan moved two more times; first to a 207-mat space in November 1897, and then to a 314-mat space in January 1898. In 1909, Kan≈ç incorporated the Kodokan, and endowed it with 10,000 yen (then about US$4,700). The reason, said Japan Times on 30 March 1913, was \\"so that this wonderful institution might be able to reconstruct, for that is what it really does, the moral and physical nature of the Japanese youth, without its founder's personal attention.\\" The Kodokan moved once again during Kan≈ç's lifetime, and on 21 March 1934, the Kodokan dedicated this 510-mat facility. Guests at the opening included the Belgian, Italian, and Afghan ambassadors to Japan.Japan Times, 23 March 1934. In 1958, when the Kodokan moved to its current eight story facility, that now has more than 1200 mats, the old building was sold to the Japan Karate Association. =Ideals= On 18 April 1888, Kan≈ç and Reverend Thomas Lindsay presented a lecture called \\"Jiujitsu: The Old Samurai Art of Fighting without Weapons\\" to the Asiatic Society of Japan. This lecture took place at the British Embassy in Tokyo. Its theme was that the main principle of judo involved gaining victory by yielding to strength.Lindsay, Thomas and Kano, Jigoro. \\"The Old Samurai Art of Fighting without Weapons\\", Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, XVI, Pt II, 1889, 1915 reprint, pp. 202‚Äì217 Being an idealist, Kan≈ç had broad aims for judo, which he saw as something that simultaneously encompassed self-defense, physical culture, and moral behavior.Kano, Jigoro. \\"The Life of Jigoro Kano\\". Reprinted in AikiNews, 85, 1990. In 1915, Kan≈ç gave this definition to judo:Murata, Naoki. \\"From 'Jutsu to D≈ç: The Birth of K≈çd≈çkan Judo.\\" In Alexander Bennett, ed., Budo Perspectives. Auckland: Kendo World, 2005, pp. 147‚Äì148. In 1918, Kan≈ç added:Murata, Naoki. \\"From 'Jutsu to D≈ç: The Birth of K≈çd≈çkan Judo.\\" In Alexander Bennett, ed., Budo Perspectives. Auckland: Kendo World, 2005, p. 150. The Kodokan dojo main entrance, Tokyo, Japan. During March 1922, Kan≈ç brought all this to fruition through the introduction of the Kodokan Bunkakai, or Kodokan Cultural Association. This organization held its first meeting at Tokyo's Seiyoken Hotel on 5 April 1922, and held its first public lecture three days later at the YMCA hall in Kanda. The mottoes of the Kodokan Cultural Association were \\"Good Use of Spiritual and Physical Strength\\" and \\"Prospering in Common for Oneself and Others.\\" Although those are literal translations, the phrases were usually translated into English as \\"Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort\\" and \\"Mutual Welfare and Benefit.\\" The theories of this organization were described in some detail in an article published in an American magazine Living Age in September 1922.Kano, Jigoro. \\"The Contribution of Jiudo to Education\\", Journal of Health and Physical Education, 3, 1932, pp. 37‚Äì40, 58. Professional life =Educator= Although Kan≈ç promoted judo whenever he could, he earned his living as an educator. Kan≈ç entered Tokyo Imperial University during June 1877. He majored in political science and economics, which at that time were taught by the Department of Aesthetics and Morals. He graduated in July 1882, and the following month he began work as a professor, fourth class, at the Gakushuin, or Peers School, in Tokyo. In 1883, Kan≈ç was appointed professor of economics at Komaba Agricultural College (now the Faculty of Agriculture at University of Tokyo), but during April 1885, he returned to Gakushuin, with the position of principal. In January 1891, Kan≈ç was appointed to a position at the Ministry of Education. In August 1891, he gave up this position to become a dean at the Fifth Higher Normal School (present-day Kumamoto University). One of the teachers at Fifth Higher between 1891 and 1893 was Lafcadio Hearn. Around this same time, Kan≈ç married. His wife, Sumako Takezoe, was the daughter of a former Japanese ambassador to Korea. Eventually, the couple had six daughters and three sons.Ishikawa, Yasujiro. Who's Who in Japan, fifth edition. Tokyo: Keiseisha, 1916, p. 256.Japan Times, 7 July 1914. During the summer of 1892, Kan≈ç went to Shanghai to help establish a program that would allow Chinese students to study in Japan. Kan≈ç revisited Shanghai during 1905, 1915, and 1921. In January 1898, Kan≈ç was appointed director of primary education at the Ministry of Education, and in August 1899, he received a grant that allowed him to study in Europe. His ship left Yokohama on 13 September 1899, and he arrived in Marseilles on 15 October. He spent about a year in Europe, and during this trip, he visited Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Amsterdam, and London. He returned to Japan in 1901. Soon after returning to Japan, he resumed his post as president of Tokyo Higher Normal School, and he remained in this position until his retirement on 16 January 1920.Japan Times, 12 January 1920; Japan Times, 15 January 1920; Japan Times, 17 January 1920. He also helped establish Nada Middle High School in 1928 at Kobe, which later became one of highest-ranked private high schools in Japan. Considering that he majored in political science and economics, Kan≈ç's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to the doors of the classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers often felt compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants. Kan≈ç believed this to be unacceptable. He refused to play such a subservient role when teaching his students. To Kan≈ç, a teacher must command respect. At the same time, he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods. The theories of the American educator John Dewey especially influenced him.Dewey visited the Kodokan on 31 March 1919. For Dewey's thoughts on Kan≈ç's methods, see John Dewey and Alice Chipman Dewey, Letters from China and Japan, edited by Evelyn Dewey (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1920), pp. 93‚Äì94. Kan≈ç's manner had the desired effect upon the students, but the administration was slower to warm to his methods and it was not until the arrival of a new principal that Kan≈ç's ideas found acceptance. All this is to say that Kan≈ç's educational philosophy was a combination of both traditional Japanese neo-Confucianism and contemporary European and American philosophies, to include Instrumentalism, Utilitarianism, and \\"evolutionary progressivism\\", as Social Darwinism was then known. The goals of Kan≈ç's educational philosophies and methods (indeed, the goals of most Japanese educational programs of the early 20th century) were: to develop minds, bodies, and spirits in equal proportion; to increase patriotism and loyalty, especially to the Emperor; to teach public morality; and to increase physical strength and stamina, especially for the purpose of making young men more fit for military service.Amano, Ikuo, Education and Examination in Modern Japan, translated by William K. Cummings and Fumiko Cummings (Tokyo: University of Tokyo, 1990), pp. 71‚Äì81 and Harries, Meirion and Susie Harries, Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army (New York: Random House, 1991), pp. 170‚Äì175. Calisthenics, especially as done in the huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and at the high school and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.Japan Times, 17 August 1936, p. 3. For Kan≈ç, the answer to this conundrum was one word: judo. Not judo in the sense of simply throwing other people around, and definitely not judo in the sense of winning at any cost. Instead, it was judo in the sense of \\"Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort\\" and \\"Mutual Welfare and Benefit.\\" Or, as Kan≈ç himself put it to a reporter in 1938: \\"When yielding is the highest efficient use of energy, then yielding is judo.\\"Japan Times, 17 May 1938, p. 5. =International Olympic Committee= Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç after the IOC vote on 31 July 1936 in Berlin, which decided to organize the 1940 Olympics in Tokyo. Kan≈ç became active in the work of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1909. This came about after Kristian Hellstr√∂m of the Swedish Olympic Committee wrote to the governments of Japan and China to ask if they were going to send teams to the 1912 Olympics.Guttman, Allen. The Olympics: A History of the Modern Games (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 31. The Japanese government did not want to embarrass itself on an international stage by saying no, so the Ministry of Education was told to look into this. The Ministry logically turned to Kan≈ç, who was a physical educator with recent experience in Europe. Kan≈ç agreed to represent Japan at the International Olympics Committee, and, after talking to the French ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes, developed, in his words, \\"a fairly good idea of what the Olympic Games were.\\"Kano, Jigoro. \\"Olympic Games and Japan,\\" Dai Nippon, 1936, p. 197. Toward fulfilling his duties as a member, in 1912, Kan≈ç helped establish the Japan Amateur Athletic Association (Dai Nippon Tai-iku Kyokai), which had the mission of overseeing amateur sport in Japan. Kan≈ç was the official representative of Japan to the Olympics in Stockholm in 1912, and he was involved in organizing the Far Eastern Championship Games held in Osaka during May 1917. In 1920, Kan≈ç represented Japan at the Antwerp Olympics, and during the early 1920s, he served on the Japanese Council of Physical Education. He did not play much part in organizing the Far Eastern Championship Games held in Osaka in May 1923, nor did he attend the 1924 Olympics in Paris, but he did represent Japan at the Olympics in Amsterdam (1928), Los Angeles (1932), and Berlin (1936). From 1931 to 1938, he was also one of the leading international spokesmen in Japan's bid for the 1940 Olympics.Svinth, Joseph R. \\"Fulfilling His Duty as a Member: Jigoro Kano and the Japanese Bid for the 1940 Olympics.\\"Svinth, Joseph R. \\"Jigoro Kano in North America\\" , The Kano Society. Kan≈ç's chief goal in all this was, in his words, to gather people together for a common cause, with friendly feeling.Kano, Jigoro. \\"Olympic Games and Japan,\\" Dai Nippon, 1936, p. 199. His goals did not, however, particularly involve getting judo into the Olympics. As he put it in a letter to Britain's Gunji Koizumi in 1936:Brousse, Michel and Matsumoto, David. Judo in the U.S.: A Century of Dedication. Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books, 2005, p. 110. Death and legacy In 1934, Kan≈ç stopped giving public exhibitions. The reason was his failing health, probably compounded by kidney stones. The British judoka Sarah Mayer wrote \\"People don‚Äôt seem to think he will live much longer\\" to her friends in London.Letters from Sarah Mayer to Gunji Koizumi, annotated by Joseph R. Svinth. Nevertheless, Kan≈ç continued attending important Kodokan events such as kagami-biraki (New Years' ceremonies) whenever he could, and he continued participating in Olympics business. In May 1938, Kan≈ç died at sea, during a voyage that he made as member of the IOC on board the NYK Line motor ship Hikawa Maru.\\"Dr. Jigoro Kano, 78, of Olympic Group; Japan's Representative on the Committee Dies at Sea\\", New York Times. 4 May 1938. p. 23, 172 words Because the Japanese merchant fleet of the 1930s used Tokyo time wherever it was in the world, the Japanese date of death was 4 May 1938 at about 5:33 am JST, whereas the international date of death was 3 May 1938 at 20:33 UTC.Japan Times, 7 May 1938. The cause of death was officially listed as pneumonia.Hirasawa, K. \\"The Death of Professor Jigoro Kano, Shi-Han\\", Judo International, edited by Henri Pl√©e. Paris, 1950, pp. 3‚Äì4. but other sources list food poisoning as the cause of death.Stephens, John Three Budo Masters Kodansha International, 1995 During the 1990s, there appeared allegations that Kan≈ç was murdered by poisoning rather than dying of pneumonia.Brown, Carl. Law and the Martial Arts. Black Belt Communications, 1998. Although there is no known contemporary documentation to support this claim, Kan≈ç's opposition to Japanese militarism was well-known, and many others who also opposed it were allegedly assassinated. Judo did not die with Kan≈ç. Instead, during the 1950s, judo clubs sprang up throughout the world, and in 1964, judo was introduced as an Olympic sport in the Tokyo Olympics, and was reintroduced at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Kan≈ç's posthumous reputation was therefore assured. Nonetheless, his true legacy was his idealism. As Kan≈ç said in a speech given in 1934, \\"Nothing under the sun is greater than education. By educating one person and sending him into the society of his generation, we make a contribution extending a hundred generations to come.\\" Kan≈ç has also been compared to the 9th Marquess of Queensberry in the way his legacy left a whole new set of rules: =Honors= * Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, 1938 (Japan).NNDB: Order of the Rising Sun Published works * Kan≈ç, Jigor≈ç.

This freeway was the first road of its kind built in Milwaukee County. It is designated as Wisconsin Highway 175 (WI 175) along its northern stretch from WIS 59, past Interstate 94 (I-94) to Lisbon Avenue. The southern portion from I-94 to National Avenue was designated as unsigned WIS 341 from August 1999 to August 2015, and is called Miller Park Way. The road travels adjacent to the east side of Miller Park, home of Major League Baseball's Milwaukee Brewers. History This freeway is the stump of what was to be a much larger freeway in Milwaukee. The Stadium Freeway, originally called the South 44th Street Expressway, was intended to extend much further to the north and south than it currently does: * The Stadium Freeway was to continue northward from its present terminus at Lisbon Avenue, where it was to intersect with the proposed Park West Freeway. It was to continue northward, intersecting with the proposed Bay and Fond du Lac freeways, and continuing northward to the city of Port Washington. * The Stadium Freeway was to continue southward from its present terminus at National Avenue, and terminate at I-43/I-894. In fact, the interchange that was supposed to connect the Stadium Freeway to the Airport Freeway (I-43/I-894) was built entirely as the Greenfield Interchange. The interchange has since been renovated by having one of the ramps (eastbound I-894/I-43 to northbound Stadium Freeway) removed, while three other ramps connect to a park and ride. In 2012, during the reconstruction of the Mitchell Interchange and the WIS 241/South 27th Street exit, another ramp (southbound Stadium Freeway to westbound I-894/I-43) was removed. This currently leaves only two ramps remaining to the original interchange. * This highway once carried U.S. Route 41 (US 41) in Wisconsin, but became WIS 175 when US 41 was moved to its current alignment with I-41 and the Zoo Freeway.  Funding  The funding may be provided by either of the following: federal, state, and county governments, although the exact mix depends on whether the routes are designated for interstate or non-interstate usage.

After graduation in 1973, he played college football at the University of Idaho in Moscow, to the south. Tormey had a standout sophomore season in 1974 for the Vandals under first-year head coach Ed Troxel, but incurred a knee injury in final game of the season which required surgery. Tormey redshirted in 1975, and returned in 1976 and was named the team's outstanding defensive player. He was all- conference (Big Sky) in 1976 at defensive end and at outside linebacker in 1977. Idaho changed from a five-man defensive line to a 4‚Äì3 defense after the 1976 season. Tormey was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and completed his bachelor's degree in education in 1978. Coaching career =Assistant coach (1978‚Äì1994)= Tormey had a brief stop with the Washington Redskins of the NFL in then began his coaching career as a high school assistant back at Gonzaga Prep in Spokane, where he also taught geography. In 1980, his collegiate coaching career began as a graduate assistant at Washington in Seattle, a position he left in 1982 to coach the defensive line at his alma mater in Moscow, serving under newly hired Idaho Vandals' head coach After two years on the Palouse, Tormey returned to the Huskies in Seattle for eleven seasons, 1984‚Äì94, coaching tight ends, linebackers, and the secondary for Don James and Jim Lambright. Undefeated UW (12‚Äì0) shared the national championship with Miami in 1991. For the 1994 season, Tormey was promoted by Lambright to defensive coordinator. =Head coach= Idaho (1995‚Äì1999) Following the 1994 season, John L. Smith left Idaho and Tormey returned to Moscow to succeed him as head coach. His first season in 1995 was the Vandals' last in the Big Sky and Division I-AA; Idaho joined the Big West in Division I-A in 1996. His starting salary in 1995 was $71,868. In Tormey's five seasons at the helm in Moscow, Idaho went , including the Vandals' first-ever bowl appearance in 1998 in the Humanitarian Bowl, a victory over 16-point favorite Southern Mississippi. The Vandals earned the bowl berth by winning the Big West title with a dramatic one-point overtime win over rival Boise State, on the road in Bronco Stadium in Boise. (Although this was Idaho's 15th win in the last 17 games in this rivalry, the 1998 win remains their most recent over BSU.) The bowl victory propelled Idaho to an impressive 9‚Äì3 record in 1998, their third season back in Division I-A, and Tormey was named coach of the year in the Big West. Before the season, the Sporting News had Idaho ranked last of 112 teams in Division I-A. Tormey interviewed in early January for the open position at Washington in Seattle, which went to Rick Neuheisel. He also interviewed at Oregon State, which hired Dennis Erickson to replace Mike Riley. The Vandals went 7‚Äì4 in 1999, including a over neighboring Washington State, to the west. It was Idaho's first football victory in the Battle of the Palouse in 34 years, breaking the Cougars' 14-game winning streak in the lopsided series.

While his win totals improved each season (2, 3, 5, 6), he was released from the fourth and final season of his contract at the end of the 2003 season, the final game marked by a 56‚Äì3 blowout loss at #18 Boise State. Most notably, Tormey failed to defeat bitter in-state rival UNLV in the annual Battle for the Fremont Cannon; his teams were also winless against Boise State and Fresno State. The Wolf Pack did defeat the Washington Huskies 28‚Äì17 in Seattle that final season (UW finished at ).

He was one of the commanders of the Egyptian forces that inflicted a defeat on the Seventh Crusade of King Louis IX of France. He also led the vanguard of the Egyptian army at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260,The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Macrop√¶dia, H.H.

Saunders, pg. 115 The reign of Baibars marked the start of an age of Mamluk dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean and solidified the durability of their military system. He managed to pave the way for the end of the Crusader presence in the Levant and reinforced the union of Egypt and Syria as the region's pre-eminent Muslim state, able to fend off threats from both Crusaders and Mongols, and even managed to subdue the kingdom of Makuria, which was famous for being unconquerable by previous Muslim empire invasion attempts. As sultan, Baibars also engaged in a combination of diplomacy and military action, allowing the Mamluks of Egypt to greatly expand their empire. Name In his native Turkic language, Baibars' name means \\"great panther\\" or \\"lord panther\\" (see also Wiktionary: bay \\"rich person, noble\\" + pars \\"leopard, panther\\"). Blazon Dinar minted during Baibars' reign, bearing his blazon, the lion/pantherhttps://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/dynasties/mamluks/coins/c50?back=1&show;=comment Possibly based on the Turkic meaning of his name, Baibars used the panther as his heraldic blazon, and placed it on both coins and buildings. The lion/panther used on the bridge built by Baibars near al-Ludd (today's Lod) plays with a rat, which may be interpreted to represent Baibars' Crusader enemies. Early life Baibars was a Kipchak born in the Dasht-i Kipchak, between the Edil (Volga) and Yaiyk (Ural) rivers.Al-Maqrizi, from the Berish tribe that currently lives in the Western part of Kazakhstan, Al Selouk Leme'refatt Dewall al-Melouk, p.520/vol.1Ibn Taghri, al-Nujum al-Zahirah Fi Milook Misr wa al-Qahirah, Year 675H /vol.7Abu al-Fida, The Concise History of Humanity, Tarikh Abu al-Fida pp.71-87/ year 676HIbn Iyas , Badai Alzuhur Fi Wakayi Alduhur, abridged and edited by Dr. M. Aljayar, Almisriya Lilkitab, Cairo 2007, , p.91Baibars in Concise Britannica Online, web pageBrief Article in Columbia Encyclopedia, web page There is a discrepancy in Ibn Taghrƒ´birdƒ´'s dating of his birth, since he says it took place in 625 AH (12 December 1227 ‚Äì 29 November 1228) and also that Baibars was about 24 years old in 1247, which would put his birth closer to 1223. He belonged to the Barli tribe. According to a fellow Cuman and eyewitness, Badr al-Din Baysari, the Barli fled the armies of the Mongols, arranging to settle in the Second Bulgarian Empire. They crossed the Black Sea from either Crimea or Alania, where they had arrived to Bulgaria about 1242. In the meantime, the Mongols invaded Bulgaria, including the regions where the Cuman refugees recently settled. Both Baibars, who witnessed his parents being massacred, and Baysari were among the captives during the invasion and were sold into slavery in the Sultanate of Rum at the slave market in Sƒ´wƒÅs. Afterwards, he was sold in Hama to , an Egyptian of high rank, who brought him to Cairo. In 1247, al-BunduqƒÅrƒ´ was arrested and the sultan of Egypt, As-Salih Ayyub, confiscated his slaves, including Baibars.. Baibars was described as fair-skinned in contrast to the \\"swarthy\\" skin of the native Egyptians, broad-faced with small eyes, very tall (which was typical in both Arabic and European descriptions of Turkic men), and having a cataract in one of his eyes. Several descriptions say he had blue eyes.  Rise to power  The Mamluks under Baibars (yellow) fought off the Franks and the Mongols during the Ninth Crusade. Baibars was a commander of the Mamluks under the Ayyubids. He may have been involved in the significant victory of the Egyptian army at the Battle of La Forbie, east of Gaza in 1244 in the aftermath of the Sixth Crusade. In 1250 he supported the defeat of the Seventh Crusade of Louis IX of France in two major battles. The first was the Battle of Al Mansurah, where he employed an ingenious strategy in ordering the opening of a gate to let the crusader knights enter the town; the crusaders rushed into the town that they thought was deserted to find themselves trapped inside. They were besieged from all directions by the Egyptian forces and the town population, and suffered heavy losses. Robert of Artois, who took refuge in a house,Lord of Joinville, 110, part II.Asly, p. 49. Skip Knox, Egyptian Counter-attack, The Seventh Crusade. and William of Salisbury were both killed, along with most of the Knights Templar. Only five Templar Knights escaped alive.According to Matthew Paris, only 2 Templars, 1 Hospitaller and one ‚Äòcontemptible person‚Äô escaped. Matthew Paris, Louis IX's Crusade, p. 14/ Vol. 5. The second was the Battle of Fariskur which essentially ended the Seventh Crusade and led to the capture of Louis IX. Egyptian forces in that battle were led by sultan Turanshah, the young son of recently deceased as-Salih Ayyub. Shortly after the victory over the Crusaders, Baibars and a group of Mamluk soldiers assassinated Turanshah, leading to as-Salih Ayyub's widow Shajar al-Durr being named sultana.Runciman, Steven, A History of the Crusades, Volume Three: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades, Cambridge University Press, London, 1951, pp. 272-273 Baibars was still a commander under sultan Qutuz at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, when he decisively defeated the Mongols. After the battle, Sultan Qutuz (aka Koetoez) was assassinated while on a hunting expedition. It was said that Baibars was involved in the assassination because he expected to be rewarded with the governorship of Aleppo for his military success, but Qutuz, fearing his ambition, refused to give him the post.The story of the involvement of Baibars in the assassination was told by different historians in different ways. In one account the assassins killed Qutuz while he was giving a hand to Baibars (Al-Maqrizi and Ibn-Taghri). In another, from an Ayyubid source, Qutuz was giving a hand to someone when Baibars struck his back with a sword (Abu- Al-Fida). A third account mentioned that Baibars tried to help Qutuz against the assassins (O. Hassan). According to Al-Maqrizi, the Emirs who struck Qutuz were Badr ad-Din Baktut, Emir Ons, and Emir Bahadir al-Mu'izzi. (Al-Maqrizi, p.519/vol.1) Baibars succeeded Qutuz as Sultan of Egypt.MacHenry, Robert. The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 1993. Baibars  Sultan of Egypt  Once Baibars had ascended to the Sultanate, his authority was soon confirmed without any serious resistance, except from Sinjar al- Halabi, another Mamluk amir who was popular and powerful enough to claim Damascus. Also, the threat from the Mongols was still serious enough to be considered as a threat to Baibars' authority. However, Baibars first chose to deal with Sinjar, and marched on Damascus. At the same time the princes of Hama and Homs proved able to defeat the Mongols in the First Battle of Homs, which lifted the Mongol threat for a while. On 17 January 1261, Baibars' forces were able to rout the troops of Sinjar outside Damascus, and pursued the attack to the city, where the citizens were loyal to Sinjar and resisted Baibars, although their resistance was soon crushed. After suppressing the revolt of Sinjar, Baibars then managed to deal with the Ayyubids, while quietly eliminating the prince of Kerak. Ayyubids such as Al-Ashraf Musa, Emir of Homs and the Ayyubid Emir Dynasty of Hama Al-Mansur Muhammad II), who had earlier staved off the Mongol threat, were permitted to continue their rule in exchange for their recognizing Baibars' authority as Sultan. After the Abbasid caliphate in Iraq was overthrown by the Mongols in 1258 when they conquered and sacked Baghdad, the Muslim world lacked a caliph, a theoretically supreme leader who had sometimes used his office to endow distant Muslim rulers with legitimacy by sending them writs of investiture. Thus, when the Abbasid refugee Abu al-Qasim Ahmad, the uncle of the last Abbasid caliph al-Musta‚Äòsim, arrived in Cairo in 1261, Baibars had him proclaimed caliph as al-Mustansir II and duly received investiture as sultan from him. Unfortunately, al-Mustansir II was killed by the Mongols during an ill-advised expedition to recapture Baghdad from the Mongols later in the same year. In 1262, another Abbasid, allegedly the great-great-great grandson of the Caliph al-Mustarshid, Abu al-‚ÄòAbbas Ahmad, who had survived from the defeated expedition, was proclaimed caliph as al-Hakim I, inaugurating the line of Abbasid caliphs of Cairo that continued as long as the Mamluk sultanate, until 1517. Like his unfortunate predecessor, al-Hakim I also received the formal oath of allegiance of Baibars and provided him with legitimation. While most of the Muslim world did not take these caliphs seriously, as they were mere instruments of the sultans, they still lent a certain legitimation as well as a decorative element to their rule. = Campaign against the Crusaders = As sultan, Baibars engaged in a lifelong struggle against the Crusader kingdoms in Syria, in part because the Christians had aided the Mongols. He started with the Principality of Antioch, which had become a vassal state of the Mongols and had participated in attacks against Islamic targets in Damascus and Syria. In 1263, Baibars laid siege to Acre, the capital of the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, although the siege was abandoned when he sacked Nazareth instead. He used siege engines to defeat the Crusaders in battles such as the Fall of Arsuf from 21 March to 30 April. After breaking into the town he offered free passage to the defending Knights Hospitallers if they surrendered their formidable citadel. The Knights accepted Baibars' offer but were enslaved anyway.Rodney Stark, 'God's Battalions', 2009, p. 230 Baibars razed the castle to the ground. He next attacked Athlith and Haifa, where he captured both towns after destroying the crusaders' resistance, and razed the citadels. In the same year Baibars laid siege to the fortress of Safed, held by the Templar knights, which had been conquered by Saladin in 1188 but returned to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1240. Baibars promised the knights safe passage to the Christian town of Acre if they surrendered their fortress. Badly outnumbered, the knights agreed. On capturing Safed, Baibars did not raze the fortress to the ground but fortified and repaired it instead, as it was strategically situated and well constructed. He installed a new governor in Safed, with the rank of Wali Later, in 1266, Baibars invaded the Christian country of Cilician Armenia which, under King Hethum I, had submitted to the Mongol Empire. After defeating the forces of Hethum I in the Battle of Mari, Baibars managed to ravage the three great cities of Mamistra, Adana and Tarsus, so that when Hetoum arrived with Mongol troops, the country was already devastated. Hetoum had to negotiate the return of his son Leo by giving control of Armenia's border fortresses to the Mamluks. In 1269, Hetoum abdicated in favour of his son and became a monk, but he died a year later.Claude Mutafian, p.60 Leo was left in the awkward situation of keeping Cilicia as a subject of the Mongol Empire, while at the same time paying tribute to the Mamluks.Bournotian, A Concise History of the Armenian People, p. 101 This isolated Antioch and Tripoli, led by Hethum's son-in-law, Prince Bohemond VI. After successfully conquering Cilicila, Baibars in 1267 settled his unfinished business with Acre, and continued the extermination of remaining crusader garrisons in the following years. In 1268, he besieged Antioch, capturing the city on 18 May. Baibars had promised to spare the lives of the inhabitants, but he broke his promise and had the city razed, killing or enslaving much of the population after the surrender.Hudson Institute > American Outlook > American Outlook Article Detail prompting the fall of the Principality of Antioch. The massacre of men, women, and children at Antioch \\"was the single greatest massacre of the entire crusading era.\\"Thomas F. Madden, The Concise History of the Crusades (3rd ed. 2014), p. 168 Priests had their throats slit inside their churches, and women were sold into slavery.Madden, supra at 168. Then he continued to Jaffa, which belonged to Guy, the son of John of Ibelin. Jaffa fell to Baibars on 7 March after twelve hours of fighting; most of Jaffa's citizens were slain {citation}, but Baibars allowed the garrison to go unharmed. After this he conquered Ashkalon and Caesarea. = Diplomacy with Golden Horde = In some time around October to November 1267, or about 666 Safar of Hijra year, Baibars wrote condolences and congratulations to the new Khan of the Golden Horde, Mengu-Timur, to urge him to fight Abaqa. Despite the failure to incite infighting between the Golden Horde and Ilkhanate, Baibars continued to conduct warm correspondence with the Golden Horde, particularly with Mengu Timur's general Noqai, who unlike Mengu Timur was very cooperative with Baibars. It is theorized that this intimacy was not only due to the religious connection (as Noqai was a Muslim, unlike his Khan), but also because Noqai was not really fond of Mengu-Timur. However, Baibars was pragmatic in his approach and did not want to become involved in complicated intrigue inside the Golden Horde, so instead he stayed close to both Mengu Timur and Noqai. = Continued campaign against Crusaders = In 1271, after Baibars captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc, he besieged Krak des Chevaliers castle, held by the Hospitallers, on 30 March. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived he began erecting mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would turn on the castle. According to Ibn Shaddad, two days later the first line of defences was captured by the besiegers; he was probably referring to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission for them to surrender. The garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives. The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward. The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two mihrabs were added to the interior. Baibars then turned his attention to Tripoli, but he interrupted his siege there to call a truce in May 1271. The fall of Antioch had led to the brief Ninth Crusade, led by Prince Edward of England, who arrived in Acre in May 1271 and attempted to ally himself with the Mongols against Baibars. So Baibars declared a truce with Tripoli, as well as with Edward, who was never able to capture any territory from Baibars anyway. According to some reports, Baibars tried to have Edward assassinated with poison, but Edward survived the attempt and returned home in 1272. = Campaign against Makuria = In 1272 the Mamluk Sultan invaded the Kingdom of Makuria, after its King David I had raided the Egyptian city of Aidhab, initiating several decades of intervention by the Mamlukes in Nubian affairs. Hostilities toward the dying Christian kingdom were sidelined as Baibars' invasion of Makuria continued for four years until, by 1276, Baibars had completed his conquest of Nubia, Including the Medieval lower Nubia which ruled by Banu Kanz. Under the terms of settlement, the Nubians were now subjected to paying jizya tribute, and in return they were allowed to keep their religion, being protected under Islamic law as 'People of the Book'; they were also allowed to continue being governed by a king from the native royal family, although this king was chosen personally by Baibars, namely a Makurian noble named Shakanda. In practice this was reducing Makuria to a vassal kingdom, effectively ending Makuria's status as an independent kingdom = Campaign against the Mongols = In 1277, Baibars invaded the Seljuq Sultanate of R√ªm, then controlled by the Ilkhanate Mongols. He defeated a Mongol army at the Battle of Elbistan and captured the city of Kayseri. Baibars himself went with a few troops to deal with the Mongol right flank that was pounding his left wing.Ibn Taghri, Al-Zahir Baibars Baibars ordered a force from the army from Hama to reinforce his left. The large Mamluk numbers were able to overwhelm the Mongol force, who instead of retreating dismounted from their horses. Some Mongols were able to escape and took up positions on the hills. Once they became surrounded they once again dismounted, and fought to the death.Al-Maqrizi,p. 99/vol.2 During the celebration of victory, Baybars said that \\"How can I be happy. Before I had thought that I and my servants would defeat the Mongols, but my left wing was beaten by them. Only Allah helped us\\".Reuven Amitai Press, Mamluk Ilkhanid war 1260‚Äì1281 The possibility of a new Mongol army convinced Baibars to return to Syria, since he was far away from his bases and supply line. As the Mamluk army returned to Syria the commander of the Mamluk vanguard, Izz al-Din Aybeg al-Shaykhi, deserted to the Mongols. Perv√¢ne sent a letter to Baibars asking him to delay his departure. Baibars chastised him for not aiding him during the Battle of Elbistan. Baibars told him he was leaving for Sivas to mislead Perv√¢ne and the Mongols as to his true destination. Baibars also sent Taybars al-Waziri with a force to raid the Armenian town of al-Rummana, whose inhabitants had hidden the Mongols earlier. Death Baibars died in Damascus on 1 July 1277. His demise has been the subject of some academic speculation. Many sources agree that he died from drinking poisoned kumis that was intended for someone else. Other accounts suggest that he may have died from a wound while campaigning, or from illness. He was buried in the Az-Zahiriyah Library in Damascus.Zahiriyya Madrasa and Mausoleum of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars Family Baibars married several women and had seven daughters and three sons. Two of his sons, al-Said Barakah and Solamish, became sultans. Assessment The lion passant was the heraldic blazon of Baibars from 1260. As the first Sultan of the Bahri Mamluk dynasty, Baibars made the meritocratic ascent up the ranks of Mamluk society. He took final control after the assassination of Sultan Sayf al Din Qutuz, but before he became Sultan he was the commander of the Mamluk forces in the most important battle of the Middle Ages, repelling a Mongol force at the legendary Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260.100 Decisive Battles: From Ancient Times to the Present. Paul K. Davis, pg. 141 Although in the Muslim world he has been considered a national hero for centuries, and in Egypt, Syria and Kazakhstan is still regarded as such, Sultan Baibars was reviled in the Christian world of the time for his seemingly unending victorious campaigns. A Templar knight who fought in the Seventh Crusade lamented: Baibars also played an important role in bringing the Mongols to Islam. He developed strong ties with the Mongols of the Golden Horde and took steps for the Golden Horde Mongols to travel to Egypt. The arrival of the Mongol's Golden Horde to Egypt resulted in a significant number of Mongols accepting Islam.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith, By Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 192 Legacy = Military legacy = Baibars was a popular ruler in the Muslim World who had defeated the crusaders in three campaigns, and the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut which many scholars deem of great macro- historical importance. In order to support his military campaigns, Baibars commissioned arsenals, warships and cargo vessels. He was also arguably the first to employ explosive hand cannons in war, at the Battle of Ain Jalut.Ahmad Y Hassan, Gunpowder Composition for Rockets and Cannon in Arabic Military Treatises In Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries (Part 4 and Part 5) His military campaign also extended into Libya and Nubia. = Culture and science = He was also an efficient administrator who took interest in building various infrastructure projects, such as a mounted message relay system capable of delivery from Cairo to Damascus in four days. He built bridges, irrigation and shipping canals, improved the harbours, and built mosques. He was a patron of Islamic science, such as his support for the medical research of his Arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis.Albert Z. Iskandar, \\"Ibn al-Nafis\\", in Helaine Selin (1997), Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, Kluwer Academic Publishers, . As a testament of a special relationship between Islam and cats, Baibars left a cat garden in Cairo as a waqf, providing the cats of Cairo with food and shelter.<!--accessdate=15 August 2013url=http://cairocats.com/title=Lorraine Chittockfirst=Leonard Younglast=leonardyoung.comdate=website=cairocats.comaccessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> His memoirs were recorded in Sirat al-Zahir Baibars (\\"Life of al- Zahir Baibars\\"), a popular Arabic romance recording his battles and achievements. He has a heroic status in Kazakhstan, as well as in Egypt and Syria. Al-Madrassa al-Zahiriyya is the school built adjacent to his Mausoleum in Damascus.

Biography  Wilkins was born at King William's Town, Eastern Cape, South Africa. His cricketing career started with Border in 1962, when he represented them for the first time in the season's Currie Cup tournament. He was the South African Cricket Annual Cricketer of the Year in 1966. He continued playing for Border through to the 1969/70 season, and represented them for the last time when visited by the travelling Australians in February 1970. In 1970, Wilkins switched from the South African game to the English game, making his debut for Derbyshire in May of the same year against Yorkshire. Wilkins spent October to February in his homeland before moving back to England to play for Derbyshire again in the 1971 season, though he stayed in England over the winter and was a first-team choice once again in the 1972 season. At the end of the 1972 season, Wilkins moved back to South Africa, but this time played for Eastern Province, having agreed a deal with Border to play for them. Eastern Province over the next few years had slightly better fortunes in their half of the Currie Cup draw than Border in theirs. He did not appear for an English county side again. Wilkins continued to play in South Africa for Natal from 1978 to 1984. Wilkins was a right-handed batsman and played 357 innings in 198 matches with an average of 32.63 and a top score of 156. He also played 91 innings in 91 one-day matches. He was a right-arm medium-pace bowler and took 142 first-class wickets at an average of 35.50 and a best performance of 4 for 19. In the one-day game he took 80 wickets with a best performance of 5 for 40. He was also an occasional wicket-keeper.

The WZKX calls were applied to 107.9. 107.1 took the name WXLS and played adult contemporary music as \\"Surf 107\\" and later \\"Lite Rock 107\\". =Kiss 107/107.1 The Monkey= On February 14, 1997, WXYK \\"Kiss 105.9\\", the market's premier CHR/Top 40 station moved to 107.1 as \\"Kiss 107, Today's Hottest Music\\" featuring market vet Patty Steele in mornings, Dave Allen for middays, Matt Austin hosting afternoons and Hurricane Kelly for nights. On September 18, 1998, after over a year of struggling to achieve ratings success, Kiss 107 relaunched as \\"107-1 The Monkey, Party Music For Humans\\" and featured more of a dance lean than a typical top 40. The Monkey debuted with market vet \\"Collin \\"The Reverend\\" Powell hosting \\"The Morning Zoo\\", Kyle Curley in Middays, Scot Fox in afternoons and current Program Director, Lucas, hosting nights. The station immediately garnered successful ratings, and in 2000 was named \\"Mississippi Radio Station Of The Year.\\" In June 2003, WXYK added nationally syndicated The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show to mornings. In July 2014, station owner, Triad Broadcasting was sold to Alpha Media along with sister stations, WCPR, WGBL, WQBB and WTNI In December 2018, it was announced Alpha Media would be selling its Gulf Coast cluster to local Mississippi broadcast company, Telesouth Communications, who already owns WOSM, the SuperTalk Mississippi affiliate in the Biloxi market. To comply with FCC ownership rules, WXYK was spun off to another local company, Port Broadcasting. The FCC approved the sale on February 12, 2019, and closed on March 1, 2019 =K-Love= At midnight on February 28, 2019, after playing \\"Now Or Never\\" by Halsey, WXYK's programming moved to sister station Bob 105-9 as \\"105.9 The Monkey\\" replacing that station's variety hits format and ending its 22-year run on 107.1 FM. The station was also assigned new call letters, WLGF.

(born February 28, 1948) is an American physicist, Nobel laureate, and the 12th United States Secretary of Energy. He is currently the William R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of Physics and Professor of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at Stanford University. He is known for his research at the University of California at Berkeley and his research at Bell Laboratories and Stanford University regarding the cooling and trapping of atoms with laser light, for which he shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics with Claude Cohen- Tannoudji and William Daniel Phillips. Chu served as United States Secretary of Energy under the administration of President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013. At the time of his appointment as Energy Secretary, Chu was a professor of physics and molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where his research was concerned primarily with the study of biological systems at the single molecule level. Chu resigned as energy secretary on April 22, 2013. He returned to Stanford as Professor of Physics and Professor of Molecular & Cellular Physiology. Chu is a vocal advocate for more research into renewable energy and nuclear power, arguing that a shift away from fossil fuels is essential to combating climate change.Sarah Jane Tribble, 'Nuclear: Dark horse energy alternative,' Oakland Tribune, 2007-06-18. He has conceived of a global \\"glucose economy\\", a form of a low-carbon economy, in which glucose from tropical plants is shipped around like oil is today. On February 22, 2019, Chu began a one-year term as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Early life and education  Chu was born in St. Louis, Missouri, with Chinese ancestry from Liuhe, Taicang, Jiangsu province, and graduated from Garden City High School. He received both a B.A. in mathematics and a B.S. in physics in 1970 from the University of Rochester. He went on to earn his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley under Eugene D. Commins, in 1976, during which he was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Chu comes from a family of highly educated white collar professionals and scholars. His father, Ju-Chin Chu, earned a doctorate in chemical engineering from MIT and taught at Washington University in St. Louis and Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and his mother studied economics at MIT. His maternal grandfather, Shu-tian Li, was a hydraulic engineer who earned a Ph.D. from Cornell University, and was a professor and president of Tianjin University (Peiyang University). His mother's uncle, Li Shu-hua, a biophysicist, studied physics at the University of Paris before returning to China. Chu's older brother, Gilbert Chu, is a professor of biochemistry and medicine at Stanford University. His younger brother, Morgan Chu, is a patent lawyer who is the former co-managing partner at the law firm Irell & Manella. According to Chu, his two brothers and four cousins have four Ph.D.s, three M.D.s, and a J.D. among them. Career and research Steven Chu lecturing After obtaining his doctorate he remained at Berkeley as a postdoctoral researcher for two years before joining Bell Labs, where he and his several co-workers carried out his Nobel Prize-winning laser cooling work. He left Bell Labs and became a professor of physics at Stanford University in 1987, serving as the chair of its Physics Department from 1990 to 1993 and from 1999 to 2001. At Stanford, Chu and three others initiated the Bio-X program, which focuses on interdisciplinary research in biology and medicine, and played a key role in securing the funding for the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology. In August 2004, Chu was appointed as the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratory, and joined UC Berkeley's Department of Physics and Department of Molecular and Cell Biology. Under Chu's leadership, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was a center of research into biofuels and solar energy. He spearheaded the laboratory's Helios project, an initiative to develop methods of harnessing solar power as a source of renewable energy for transportation. Chu's early research focused on atomic physics by developing laser cooling techniques and the magneto-optical trapping of atoms using lasers. He and his co-workers at Bell Labs developed a way to cool atoms by employing six laser beams opposed in pairs and arranged in three directions at right angles to each other. Trapping atoms with this method allows scientists to study individual atoms with great accuracy. Additionally, the technique can be used to construct an atomic clock with great precision. At Stanford, Chu's research interests expanded into biological physics and polymer physics at the single-molecule level. He studied enzyme activity and protein and RNA folding using techniques like fluorescence resonance energy transfer, atomic force microscopy, and optical tweezers. His polymer physics research used individual DNA molecules to study polymer dynamics and their phase transitions. He continued researching atomic physics as well and developed new methods of laser cooling and trapping. Honors and awards Steven Chu in 2014 Steven Chu is a co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for the \\"development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light\\", shared with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William Daniel Phillips. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Academia Sinica of Taiwan, and is a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Korean Academy of Science and Engineering. He was also awarded the Humboldt Prize by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 1995. In 1998, Chu received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Steven Chu with his medal as a Pontifical Academician, 12 November 2018 Chu received an honorary doctorate from Boston University when he was the keynote speaker at the 2007 commencement exercises. He is a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council.Design Futures Council Senior Fellows. di.net Diablo Magazine awarded him an Eco Award in its April 2009 issue,Diablo Eco Awards Diablo Eco Awards. Diablo magazine April 2009 shortly after he was nominated for Energy Secretary. Washington University in St. Louis and Harvard University awarded him honorary doctorates during their 2010 and 2009 commencement exercises, respectively. He was awarded an honorary degree from Yale University during its 2010 commencement. He was also awarded an honorary degree from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, the same institution at which his father taught for several years, during its 2011 commencement. Penn State University awarded him an honorary doctorate during their 2012 commencement exercises. In 2014, Chu was awarded an honorary doctorate from Williams College, during which he gave a talk moderated by Williams College Professor Protik Majumder. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth College during its 2015 commencement. Chu was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Amherst College in 2017, where he later gave a lecture titled \\"Climate Change and Needed Technical Solutions for a Sustainable Future\\" in March 2018. Chu was elected an international fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering UK in 2011, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2014. His nomination reads: U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu meeting with President Barack Obama on February 5, 2009. Steven Chu in 2011 His nomination to be Secretary of Energy was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 20, 2009. On January 21, 2009, Chu was sworn in as Secretary of Energy in the Barack Obama administration. Chu is the first person appointed to the U.S. Cabinet after having won a Nobel Prize. He is also the second Chinese American to be a member of the U.S. Cabinet, after former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao. His scientific work continued, however, and he even published a paper on gravitational redshift in Nature in February 2010 According to Nature he worked on this \\"during nights, weekends and on planes ‚Äì after putting in 70‚Äì80 hours a week as energy secretary\\" and another one he co-authored in July 2010. In March 2011 Chu said that regulators at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission should not delay approving construction licenses for planned U.S. nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. In August 2011 Chu praised an advisory panel report on curbing the environmental risks of natural-gas development. Chu responded to the panel's report on hydraulic fracturing, the controversial drilling method that is enabling a U.S. gas boom while bringing fears of groundwater contamination. The report called for better data collection of air and water data, as well as \\"rigorous\\" air pollution standards and mandatory disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Chu said that he would \\"be working closely with my colleagues in the Administration to review the recommendations and to chart a path for continued development of this vital energy resource in a safe manner\\". Chu faced controversy for a statement he made prior to being appointed, claiming in a September 2008 interview with the Wall Street Journal that \\"somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.\\" However, in March 2012 he retracted this comment, saying \\"since I walked in the door as secretary of Energy I've been doing everything in my powers to do what we can to ‚Ä¶ reduce those prices\\" and that he \\"no longer shares the view [that we need to figure out how to boost gasoline prices in America]\\". On February 12, 2013, Chu was the designated survivor during the State of the Union address. On February 1, 2013, Chu announced his intent to resign. In his resignation announcement, he warned of the risks of climate change from continued reliance on fossil fuels, and wrote, \\"the Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones; we transitioned to better solutions\\". He resigned on April 22, 2013. Energy and climate change Chu has been a vocal advocate for more research into renewable energy and nuclear power, arguing that a shift away from fossil fuels is essential to combat climate change and global warming. He also spoke at the 2009 and 2011 National Science Bowl about the importance of America's science students, emphasizing their future role in environmental planning and global initiative. Chu said that a typical coal power plant emits 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant.Steven Chu: ‚ÄòCoal is My Worst Nightmare‚Äô, Wall St. Journal, December 11, 2008 Steven Chu (right) with IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol (middle) and Oliver Inderwildi (left) at the Oxford Union, University of Oxford Chu warns that global warming could wipe out California farms within the century. He joined the Copenhagen Climate Council, an international collaboration between business and science established to create momentum for the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 2015, Chu signed the Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, Fran√ßois Hollande, as part of the successful COP21 climate summit in Paris. Chu was instrumental in submitting a winning bid for the Energy Biosciences Institute, a BP-funded $500 million multidisciplinary collaboration between UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, and the University of Illinois. This sparked controversy on the Berkeley campus, where some fear the alliance could harm the school's reputation for academic integrity. Based partially on his research at UC Berkeley, Chu has speculated that a global \\"glucose economy\\", a form of a low-carbon economy, could replace the current system. In the future, special varieties of high-glucose plants would be grown in the tropics, processed, and then the chemical would be shipped around like oil is today to other countries. The St. Petersburg Times has stated that Chu's concept \\"shows vision on the scale needed to deal with global warming\\". Chu has also advocated making the roofs of buildings and the tops of roads around the world white or other light colors, which may reflect sunlight back into space and mitigate global warming. The effect would be, according to Chu, similar to taking every car in the world off the roads for about 11 years. Samuel Thernstrom, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and co- director of its Geoengineering Project, expressed support for the idea in The American, praising Chu for \\"do[ing] the nation a service\\" with the concept. Chu is on the board of directors of Xyleco, a company developing alternate energy.  Personal life  In 1997, he married Jean Fetter, a British- American Oxford-trained physicist. He has two sons, Geoffrey and Michael, from a previous marriage to Lisa Chu-Thielbar. Chu is interested in sports such as baseball, swimming, and cycling. He taught himself tennis‚Äîby reading a book‚Äîin the eighth grade, and was a second-string substitute for the school team for three years. He also taught himself how to pole vault using bamboo poles obtained from the local carpet store. Chu said he never learned to speak Chinese because his parents always spoke to their children in English.

The video, created using the fighting game Soulcalibur, features two players both controlling the character Voldo, using existing in-game animation to have the characters perform a synchronized dance to the song \\"Hot in Herre\\" by musician Nelly. The result of over a week's full-time preparation and training, the video was conceived after Brandt noticed the character's animations and attacks could be triggered in sync with the beat of a song, and the reactions of onlookers to such a display. While several groups demonstrated interest in showcasing the video, complications arose from the copyright holders whose works were involved in creation. The video has been well received, cited as one of the first examples of machinima-based music videos, and has since spawned several fan-based imitations with Voldo dancing to various songs. Several sources such as The Village Voice have praised the video for its choreography and presentation, while several books and college professors have cited it as a notable example of machinima animation in lectures on the subject. It was also nominated at the 2005 Machinima Film Festival awards for Best Virtual Performance, and served as part of an exhibit for the San Jose Museum of Art. Conception and creation In February 2002, Chris Brandt and Jesse Reklaw played Soulcalibur during a party hosted by Landry Walker. Both Brandt and Reklaw were using the Voldo character, but rather than fighting, Reklaw was making the character do herky-jerky moves. Brandt decided to mimic Reklaw's gameplay, resulting in what he describes as \\"an impromptu dance of sorts\\". When the party music changed to \\"Move Bitch\\", Brandt noticed a consistent time interval for all of Voldo's motions, and had the character's movement follow the beat of the music. Reklaw noticed and followed in rhythm, entertaining other party guests with the results. In September, Brandt met up with Reklaw and other friends, and the subject turned to what had happened in February. Deciding to demonstrate it, the two played against each other using Voldo again, with the characters \\"dancing\\" to various songs. Noticing that everyone was entertained by the homoerotic nature of Voldo's animation, Brandt decided to develop a music video. In October, realizing he lacked the funds to pursue his bigger art projects, Brandt decided to work on the Voldo video project using the song \\"Hot in Herre\\". However, the only partner he had to create the video with was his roommate, M., who initially wanted nothing to do with it. After seeing Brandt work on the concept by himself however, M. agreed to help as long as he remained anonymous, and the project's schedule fit around his drinking habit. Development of the choreography was completed the next day, and the following five days were devoted to producing the video at five-hour intervals for each day, while the music played through the television via a PlayStation 2's audio cable. However, by the fifth day, both realized that the music was actually distracting, and Brandt recorded himself counting out the beat of the song. Using this as the audio track, they were able to complete the project easily, and after editing the video Brandt released two versions online, with the latter utilizing the song \\"Kiss\\" by Prince. In 2004, Brody Condon showed the video at a gaming/machinima conference in Australia. Interest was shown by G4TechTV, MTV, and Microsoft to feature the video on their respective media; however, they hit complications with both the copyright holders of Soulcalibur, Namco, and Nelly, whose agents wanted $100,000 to license the song. To rectify the latter problem, Brandt contacted a musician he had worked with on another project, Tana Rusitanonta, who'd expressed interest in producing his own music for the character, to produce a song that sounded similar to the original without infringing on the copyright, producing the \\"final\\" version of the video. However, shortly thereafter Namco explicitly stated they would not license the character for such means, and discussions ceased. Critical reception Since its release, Dance, Voldo, Dance has been well received by the public, appearing briefly on the popularity index Popdex's \\"Top 10\\". Several fan-made machinima have followed suit, each using the same concept of two Voldo characters dancing to various songs. In 2005, it was nominated for Best Virtual Performance at the Machinima Film Festival. In 2006, from January 21 to April 29 it was featured at the San Jose Museum of Art as part of their \\"Heavenly Bodies\\" exhibit. At the 2006 Machinima Film Festival, Machinima.com founder Hugh Hancock and Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences founder Paul Marino cited Dance, Voldo, Dance as one of the first examples of machinima-based music videos. The book SwanQuake: The User Manual described it as a difficult form of machinima to characterize, describing it \\"genre-bending work\\" and having elements of puppetry, moviemaking, and choreography. Another book, The Machinima Reader, described it as \\"an ingenious fight-as-dance choreography\\", citing the \\"sexualized virtual identity\\" of the character combined with the original soundtrack. In Developing Interactive Narrative Content, Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor Michael Nitsche compared the animation to virtual puppetry in that it was rooted solely on in-game animation, yet also used it as an example to illustrate that such material could be entertaining. In Medien K√∂rper Imagination, the motions used in the video were described as both descriptive and often prescriptive, comparing it to time and motion studies. The Village Voice described it as a \\"virtuoso in-game performance\\", describing it as one of the most impressive works showcased at 2005 Machinima Film Festival. The book Playing with Videogames called it \\"extraordinarily skillful and humorous\\", citing it as both a suspension of the game's normal purpose by players with \\"parodic humor\\" and one of the defining moments in machinima. In a study of video games as an art form, University of Montreal lecturer Martin Picard cited it as an example of machinima and performance, calling it \\"perfectly choreographed\\" and a \\"superb example of gameplay and performance\\". University of California professor Michael Mateas stated he enjoyed the dance performance of the presentation in light of more narrative forms of machinima, adding that it was enhanced by Voldo's \\"S&M; attire\\".

At about RM 12 (RK 19), Abiqua Creek receives Hammond Creek, and shortly thereafter Echo Creek, and about later, Powers Creek, all from the left. = Gallon House Bridge = About from the mouth, the stream passes under Oregon Route 213 between Silverton and Molalla, and about from the mouth it goes under Oregon Route 214 between Silverton and Mount Angel. Shortly thereafter, it passes under Gallon House Road, which is carried by the covered Gallon House Bridge. It crosses under Mount Angel Highway before reaching the Pudding River, by river from its confluence with the Molalla River. =Discharge= The Marion Soil and Water Conservation District operates a stream monitor on Abiqua Creek at Gallon House Road about from the mouth. District calculations based on data from the monitor suggest that the flow of the creek there varies from near zero to about . These figures do not include readings near flood stage because the district's monitor cannot safely measure the highest flows. Reservoir and fish ladder Abiqua Creek is the main water supply for the city of Silverton, which also gets water from Silver Creek and stores water in Silverton Reservoir. The Abiqua Creek water reaches the city from a diversion dam in the Cascade Range foothills at RM 10.4 (RK 16.7). The diversion dam's higher elevation above sea level allows water to flow to the Silverton water treatment plant without pumping. In 2007, the city of Silverton, the Pudding River Watershed Council, and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) began a project to improve fish passage on Abiqua Creek. The first stage of the project involves evaluating the effectiveness of the fish ladder on the city's diversion dam, built in 1916. The creek supports native populations of winter steelhead and has the potential to support spring chinook salmon. Abiqua Creek has historically supported the largest steelhead spawning populations in the Pudding River watershed. A catch-and-release fishing season for coastal cutthroat trout begins at the end of May, but the creek is closed to salmon and steelhead fishing.

Wise Temple (formerly the Plum Street Temple) is the historic synagogue erected for Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise and his congregation in Cincinnati, Ohio. Wise was among the founders of American Reform Judaism. The temple building was designed by prominent Cincinnati architect James Keys Wilson. Its design was inspired by the Alhambra at Granada. The temple is located at 720 Plum Street in Cincinnati, Ohio and was built by members of the Lodge Street Synagogue. It was built chiefly during the Civil War, at a cost of $275,000. The temple was dedicated on Friday, August 24, 1866, and is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States.\\"Rediscovering Jewish Infrastructure: Update on United States Nineteenth Century Synagogues,\\" Mark W. Gordon, American Jewish History 84.1 (1996) 11-27 . 2019 article update. The temple is across Plum Street from the historic Saint Peter In Chains Cathedral and next to the site of the former St. Paul Episcopal Cathedral, which was torn down in 1937. In 1972, the Plum Street Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975 for its architecture and its role in the Reform movement. History Early 20th century photo of the Plum Street Temple In 1840, a group of German Jewish immigrants in Cincinnati organized as a separate congregation, K.K. B'nai Yeshurun, breaking away from the existing congregation, K. K. Bene Israel. Their first place of worship was in a home on Third Street, between Sycamore and Broadway. In 1841 the congregation purchased and renovated for use as a house of worship a Federal- style, brick, four-story row house on Lodge Street.Picture available in The History of the K. K. Bene Yeshurun, of Cincinnati, Ohio, from the Date of Its Organization, Bloch Printing Co., 1892, book has no page numbers. The congregation built its first synagogue in 1848 on Lodge Street in the gothic Revival style. The Lodge Street Synagogue was dedicated on September 22, 1848 in Cincinnati, Ohio. It can be seen here: , Cincinnati Memory The congregation voted in 1853 to engage Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise as its spiritual leader; this congregation built the Plum Street Temple beginning in 1865. Prior to the Civil War, the 200 families of K. K. B'nai Yeshurun (Isaac M. Wise Temple) envisioned a magnificent building to house their growing twenty-year-old congregation that had already gained a national prominence because of their rabbi, Isaac Mayer Wise. With his energy and vision, the congregation and Cincinnati were fast becoming a center of national Jewish life. Plum Street Temple was built chiefly during the Civil War, at a cost of $275,000. Plum Street Temple was dedicated on Friday, August 24, 1866. The original ledger book with all the entries of specific costs entailed in the construction of Plum Street Temple was found in the early 21st century. A commemorative march for piano, called The Progress March, by P. Martens, was published by J. L. Peters. The temple is featured prominently on the cover.https://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/collection- pdfs/levy-034-066a.pdf In 1972 Sally Priesand became America's first female rabbi ordained by a rabbinical seminary, and the second formally ordained female rabbi in Jewish history, after Regina Jonas of Germany in 1935.

Terrain or relief is an essential aspect of physical geography, and as such its portrayal presents a central problem in cartographic design, and more recently geographic information systems and geovisualization. Hill profiles From a 1639 map of Hispaniola by Johannes Vingboons, showing use of hill profiles The most ancient form of relief depiction in cartography, hill profiles are simply illustrations of mountains and hills in profile, placed as appropriate on generally small-scale (broad area of coverage) maps. They are seldom used today except as part of an \\"antique\\" styling. =Physiographic illustration= Section of Raisz' 1941 map of the Northwestern United States, showing his style of landform illustration. In 1921, A.K. Lobeck published A Physiographic Diagram of the United States, using an advanced version of the hill profile technique to illustrate the distribution of landforms on a small-scale map.Lobeck, A.K. (1921) A Physiographic Diagram of the United States, A.J. Nystrom & Co., digital scan at David Rumsey Map Collection, List No.7129.000. Erwin Raisz further developed, standardized, and taught this technique, which uses generalized texture to imitate landform shapes over a large area. A combination of hill profile and shaded relief, this style of terrain representation is simultaneously idiosyncratic to its creator‚Äîoften hand-painted‚Äîand found insightful in illustrating geomorphological patterns. =Plan oblique relief= Web version of Patterson's Physical Map of the Coterminous United States featuring plan oblique relief. Note the appearance of the Rocky Mountains in the full-size version. More recently, Tom Patterson developed a computer-generated technique for mapping terrain inspired by Raisz's work, called plan oblique relief. This tool starts with a shaded relief image, then shifts pixels northward proportional to their elevation. The effect is to make mountains \\"stand up\\" and \\"lay over\\" features to the north, in the same fashion as hill profiles. Some viewers are able to see the effect more easily than others. Hachures Dufour map of Bern (1907); this is a shaded hachure map. Hachures, first standardized by the Austrian topographer Johann Georg Lehmann in 1799, are a form of shading using lines. They show the orientation of slope, and by their thickness and overall density they provide a general sense of steepness. Being non-numeric, they are less useful to a scientific survey than contours, but can successfully communicate quite specific shapes of terrain. They are especially effective at showing relatively low relief, such as rolling hills. It was a standard on topographic maps of Germany well into the 20th Century. There have been multiple attempts to recreate this technique using digital GIS data, with mixed results. Contour lines First developed in France in the 18th Century, contour lines (or isohypses) are isolines of equal elevation. This is the most common way of visualizing elevation quantitatively, and is familiar from topographic maps. Most 18th- and early 19th-century national surveys did not record relief across the entire area of coverage, calculating only spot elevations at survey points. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographical survey maps included contour representation of relief, and so maps that show relief, especially with exact representation of elevation, came to be called topographic maps (or \\"topo\\" maps) in the United States, and the usage has spread internationally. Siegfried map of Bernina Pass (1877) with black, blue and brown contour lines at 30-meter intervals On maps produced by Swisstopo, the color of the contour lines is used to indicate the type of ground: black for bare rock and scree, blue for ice and underwater contours, and brown for earth-covered ground. Swisstopo, Conventional Signs . =Tanaka (relief) contours= The Tanaka (relief) contours technique is a method used to illuminate contour lines in order to help visualize terrain. Lines are highlighted or shaded depending on their relationship to a light source in the Northwest. If the object being illustrated would shadow a section of contour line, that contour would be represented with a black band. Otherwise, slopes facing the light source would be represented by white bands. This method was developed by Professor Tanaka Kitiro in 1950, but had been experimented with as early as 1870, with little success due to technological limitations in printing. The resulting terrain at this point was a grayscale image.Fundamentals of Cartography. Misra R. P. and A. Ramesh. Concept Publishing Company. 1989. pp. 389-390 Cartographer Berthold Horn later created software to digitally produce Tanaka Contours, and Patrick Kennelly, another cartographer, later found a way to add color to these maps, making them more realistic.Patrick Kennelly & A. Jon Kimerling (2001) Modifications of Tanaka's Illuminated Contour Method, Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 28:2, 111-123. There are a number of issues with this method. Historically, printing technology did not reproduce Tanaka contours well, especially the white lines on a gray background. This method is also very time-consuming. In addition, the terraced appearance does not look appealing or accurate in some kinds of terrain.\\"RELIEF (TERRAIN) DEPICTION.\\" UNBC GIS LAB: GIS & Remote Sensing. University of Northern British Columbia, n.d. Web. 28 Sept. 2013. Hypsometric tints Shaded relief Top: map of Lake Mead area. Bottom: the same map with sun shading. Shaded relief, or hill-shading, shows the shape of the terrain in a realistic fashion by showing how the three- dimensional surface would be illuminated from a point light source. The shadows normally follow the convention of top-left lighting in which the light source is placed near the upper-left corner of the map. If the map is oriented with north at the top, the result is that the light appears to come from the north-west. Although this is unrealistic lighting in the northern hemisphere, using a southern light source can cause multistable perception illusions, in which the topography appears inverted. Shaded relief was traditionally drawn with charcoal, airbrush and other artist's media. The Swiss cartographerr Eduard Imhof is widely regarded as a master of manual hill-shading technique and theory. Shaded relief is today almost exclusively computer-generated from digital elevation models (DEM). The mathematical basis of analytical hillshading is to calculate the surface normal at each location, then calculate the angle between that vector and the vector pointing to the illumination using the Dot product; the smaller that angle, the more illumination that location is receiving. However, most software implementations use algorithms that shorten those calculations. This tool is available in a variety of GIS and graphics software, including Photoshop, QGIS, GRASS GIS or ArcMap's Spatial Analyst extension. While these relatively simple tools have made shaded relief almost ubiquitous in maps, many cartographers have been unhappy with the product, and have developed techniques to improve its appearance, including the following: =Illuminated shading= Imhof's contributions included a multi-color approach to shading, with purples in valleys and yellows on peaks, which is known as ‚Äúilluminated shading.‚Äù Illuminating the sides of the terrain facing the light source with yellow colors provides greater realism (since direct sunlight is more yellow, and ambient light is more blue), enhances the sense of the three-dimensional nature of the terrain, and make the map more aesthetically pleasing and artistic-looking. Much work has been done in digitally recreating the work of Eduard Imhof, which has been fairly successful in some cases.Tom Patterson, \\"See the light: How to make illuminated shaded relief in Photoshop 6.0,\\" http://www.shadedrelief.com/illumination/ (accessed 30 October 2017). =Multi-directional shading= Zion National Park, Utah, showing the effect of multi-directional hillshading. Left: one light source, standard northwest azimuth; Middle: average of two light sources, northwest + vertical; Right: average of 32 light sources from all directions but concentrated in the northwest, each with shadows added. Note the decreasing starkness, increasing realism, and increasing clarity of cliffs, canyons, and mountains in this area of over 1,000 m of local relief. A common criticism of computer-generated analytical hillshading is its stark, artificial look, in which slopes facing the light are solid white, and slopes facing away are solid black. Raisz called it \\"plastic shading,\\" and others have said it looks like a moonscape. One solution is to incorporate multiple lighting directions to imitate the effect of ambient lighting, creating a much more realistic looking product. Multiple techniques have been proposed for doing this, including using Geographic information systems software for generating multiple shaded relief images and averaging them together, using 3-d modeling software to render terrain,Huffman, Daniel P. (2014) Shaded Relief in Blender, 9th ICA Mountain Cartography Workshop and custom software tools to imitate natural lighting using up to hundreds of individual sources.Kennelly, J., & Stewart, J. (2006). A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas. Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 33(1), 21‚Äì36. https://doi.org/10.1559/152304006777323118. This technique has been found to be most effective for very rugged terrain at medium scales of 1:30,000 to 1:1,000,000. =Texture/bump mapping= Map of Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, using texture mapping to subtly indicate vegetation cover It is possible to make the terrain look more realistic by imitating the three- dimensional look of not only the bare land surface, but also the features covering that land surface, such as buildings and plants. Texture mapping or bump mapping is a technique adapted from Computer graphics that adds a layer of shaded texture to the shaded surface relief that imitates the look of the local land cover.Blinn, James F. \\"Simulation of Wrinkled Surfaces\\", Computer Graphics, Vol. 12 (3), pp. 286-292 SIGGRAPH-ACM (August 1978) This texture can be generated in several ways: * Texture substitution: Copying, abstracting, and merging remote sensing imagery of land cover. * Texture generation: Creating a simulated land cover elevation layer in GIS, such as a random scattering of \\"trees,\\" then generating a shaded relief of this. * Elevation measurement: Using fine resolution remote sensing techniques, especially Lidar and drones, to directly or indirectly (through Photogrammetry) measure the height and or shape of land cover features, and shade that elevation surface. This technique is most useful at producing realistic maps at relatively large scales, 1:5,000 to 1:50,000. =Resolution mixing or bumping= An illustration of the resolution bumping technique of shaded relief, Bitterroot Mountains and Salmon River, Montana/Idaho. Left: 200 m resolution shaded relief, middle: shaded relief after 7000 m smoothing filter, right: 65%/35% mix. The original image looks uniformly rugged, while the one on the right emphasizes the larger mountains and canyons. One challenge with shaded relief, especially at small scales (1:500,000 or less), is that the technique is very good at visualizing local (high-frequency) relief, but may not effectively show larger features. For example, a rugged area of hills and valleys will show as much or more variation than a large, smooth mountain. Resolution bumping is a hybrid technique developed by NPS cartographer Tom Patterson to mitigate this problem.Patterson, Tom., \\"Resolution bumping GTOPO30 in Photoshop: How to Make High-Mountains More Legible,\\" http://www.shadedrelief.com/bumping/bumping.html (accessed 24 September 2012) A fine-resolution DEM is averaged with a heavily smoothed version (i.e., significantly coarser resolution). When the hillshading algorithm is applied to this, it has the effect of blending the fine details of the original terrain model with the broader features brought out by the smoothed model. This technique works best at small scales and in regions that are consistently rugged. Oblique view 1618 oblique map of Paris by Claes Jansz. Visscher. A three-dimensional view (projected onto a two-dimensional medium) of the surface of the Earth, along with the geographic features resting on it. Imagined aerial views of cities were first produced during the late Middle ages, but these \\"bird's eye views\\" became very popular in the United States during the 1800s. The advent of GIS (especially recent advances in 3-D and global visualization) and 3-D graphics modeling software has made the production of realistic aerial views relatively easy, although the execution of quality Cartographic design on these models remains a challenge. Raised- relief map Hand-made raised-relief map of the High Tatras in scale 1: 50 000 This is a map in which relief is shown as a three-dimensional object. The most intuitive way to depict relief is to imitate it at scale. Hand-crafted dioramas may date back to 200BCE in China, but mass production did not become available until World War II with the invention of vacuum-formed plastic maps, and computerized machining to create molds efficiently. Machining is also used to create large custom models from substrates such as high-density foam, and can even color them based on aerial photography by placing an inkjet printhead on the machining device. The advent of 3D printing has introduced a much more economical, means to produce raised-relief maps, although most 3D printers are too small to efficiently produce large dioramas. Skeletal, structural, or break lines Emphasizes hydrological drainage divide and watershed streams. Forums and associations Portrayal of relief is especially important in mountainous regions. The Commission on Mountain Cartography of the International Cartographic Association is the best-known forum for discussion of theory and techniques for mapping these regions.

Prior to that, she served as a US Navy transport ship under the name USS Chaumont (AP-5). USS Chaumont, one of twelve 13,400-ton (displacement) Hog Island Type B (Design 1024) transports laid down in November 1918 as SS Shope for the U.S. Shipping Board, launched in March 1920 at Hog Island, Pennsylvania by the American International Shipbuilding Corporation. In November 1920 the ship was delivered to the Shipping Board and transferred to the War Department on 15 December 1920 with assignment to the U.S. Army Transport Service. Redundant to Army needs, she was transferred ‚Äúon loan‚Äù to the Navy on 3 November 1921 and commissioned on the 22nd, Lieutenant Commander G. H. Emmerson in temporary command. On 1 December 1921, Commander C.L. Arnold assumed command. Permanent transfer to the Navy by Executive order was effective 6 August 1924. Peacetime service Assigned to transport duty, Chaumont sailed the Atlantic, Pacific, and Caribbean throughout the 1920s and 1930s. From her home port at San Francisco, she commenced a career of trans- Pacific troop service that initially consisted of voyages between California and Manila via Honolulu. Two or three voyages in 1925-26 took her to Shanghai instead of Manila, and she continued to stop at Shanghai at least once during most subsequent years. One of her most important contributions, when in the Pacific, was aiding in the collection of meteorological information used by the Weather Map Service of the Asiatic Fleet. She also carried military supplies, Marine expeditionary forces, sailors and their dependents, and occasionally members of congressional committees on inspection tours, calling at ports from Shanghai to Bermuda. In August 1926 she sailed from San Francisco through the Panama Canal to Annapolis. The return trip took her to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was drydocked for routine maintenance, and then to Guantanamo Bay. Such voyages between the East and West Coasts also became near-annual events. =Missions to Shanghai= Chaumont's voyages to Shanghai provided important assistance to U.S. Far Eastern diplomacy during the 1920s and 1930s by supporting the Marine Corps units deployed to the International Settlement in that city to protect U.S. nationals there. At the end of January 1932 Japanese forces in the Settlement attacked nearby Chinese forces, leading to intensive fighting in the city. USS Chaumont with the 6th Marine Regiment, Shanghai, China 1937 Chaumont was in Manila at the time, and on 31 January the Navy Department ordered her to embark the 1,000 men of the Army's 31st Infantry Regiment and sail for Shanghai. Responding rapidly, Chaumont cleared Manila with the troops on board on 2 February and arrived at Shanghai on the 5th. Five years later, in mid-September 1937, Chaumont rushed the 6th Marine Regiment to Shanghai to reinforce the 4th Regiment that was protecting the Settlement during the all-out Japanese effort to seize the city from tenacious Chinese defenders. Chaumont suffered two mishaps during her China service in 1936-37, a week-long period aground at Chingwangtao and a collision at Shanghai with the Italian cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli. World War II When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Chaumont was on one of her regular voyages from Hawaii to Manila, carrying sailors, civilian workmen, and cargo that included munitions. She was diverted as part of the \\"Pensacola Convoy\\" to Brisbane then, after a period of reloading the convoy's men and cargo, she proceeded to Darwin, Australia with Navy supplies where she discharged her passengers and cargo on 5 January 1942. After returning to Brisbane she went to Sydney then Wellington, New Zealand and Balboa before returning to San Francisco on 29 March 1942. After two runs to Pearl Harbor, the now elderly transport was assigned to service between Seattle and Alaska, bringing men and supplies to assist in the defense of the Aleutians. Selected in March 1943 for conversion to a hospital ship, Chaumont was decommissioned in August for conversion at Seattle. Renamed Samaritan (AH-10), she was recommissioned in March 1944. Between 25 March and 11 May, she made two voyages from San Francisco to Hawaii, with passengers outward bound and patients homeward bound. Arriving in Honolulu a third time 11 May, she continued to Kwajalein, where from 17 June to 1 July, she treated casualties from the Saipan invasion. On 8 July she arrived off Saipan itself to embark patients for evacuation to Noumea, New Caledonia, from which she returned to Saipan 1 August for two weeks of duty as a receiving hospital. Off Iwo Jima, February 1945 Samaritan evacuated patients from Guam to Guadalcanal, and from Peleliu to the Russell Islands in August and September 1944. After a brief overhaul at Espiritu Santo, she served as base hospital at Ulithi until 16 February 1945, when she sailed for Iwo Jima. She arrived off the bitterly engaged island 20 February, and sailed 2 days later with 606 patients on board for Saipan. On the second day out, eight men were buried at sea. The hospital ship returned to Iwo Jima 25 February 1945 to embark patients for transportation to Guam on the first of two such voyages. She arrived at Ulithi 2 April, and a week later got underway for embattled Okinawa. Arriving 13 April, she received casualties at the beach during the daytime and withdrew at night to the transport areas offshore, alternating her stays at Okinawa with evacuation voyages to Saipan until 1 July, when she sailed from Saipan for Pearl Harbor. Here she took patients from several island hospitals on board, sailed to San Francisco, and on 10 September back to Pearl Harbor thence Sasebo, where she provided hospital facilities to occupation forces until 15 March 1946. Decommissioning She returned to San Francisco 23 April, and was decommissioned there 25 June 1946. On 29 August 1946 she was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal, and was delivered to a scrapping firm in January 1948.

He was a wealthy inventor and manufacturer in New York City. They lived in New York City until 1928, then moved to Beverly Hills, California. During World War I, Mrs. McQueen left her home and served in war relief work in Palestine under Field Marshal Allenby. In 1919, she founded the Jerusalem News, the first English-language newspaper in Jerusalem. =Interest in aviation= In 1920, she witnessed seven airplanes \\"take the place of two British regiments of soldiers\\" in routing a large number of rebel Arab cavalry in the desert near Aden. This ignited her interest in aviation. In September 1928, she organized the Women's Aeronautic Association of California. Similar organizations were soon founded in New York, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Canada, England, France, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. In May 1929, these various groups were merged into the Women's International Association of Aeronautics (WIAA), and this organization became the principal focus of her activities for the rest of her life. She served as \\"founder and honorary president\\" of the WIAA; presidents of the association were, in turn, prominent British aviator Lady Mary Heath (1929-1932), British reporter Lady Grace Hay Drummond-Hay (1932-1940), educator Dr. Mary Sinclair Crawford (1940-1947), actress Mary Pickford (1947-1949), airplane manufacturing executive Olive Ann Beech (1949-1954), and pioneer aviator Matilde Moisant (1954-). There was even a junior division of the WIAA, formed in 1931; members under 7 years old were called \\"tailwinds\\", and those from 7 through 20 years old were called \\"zoomers\\". In 1929, Mrs. McQueen and Lady Heath approached the Federation Aeronautique Internationale in Paris in order to have women's air records recognized. At the same time, in order to arouse greater interest in women's flying, Mrs. McQueen conceived the idea and was one of the principal organizers of the first Women's Air Derby from Santa Monica, California, to the 1929 National Air Races in Cleveland. (This event would become known as the \\"Powder Puff Derby\\".) =Later life= Ulysses Grant McQueen died in 1937, and about 1955 Mrs. McQueen married Dr. Irving Reed Bancroft, a prominent retired Los Angeles physician. =Death= She died at her home in Hermosa Beach, California, on December 24, 1958, at the age of 80, after a long period of declining health. She was cremated and her ashes were buried at the Portal of Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation. Her archive is at the University of Southern California, Doheny Memorial Library in the Rare Books & Manuscripts room.

The reservoir serves the purpose of flood control on the creek. The lake is popular in the spring and summer as a recreation area. Stocked with roughly 20,000 hatchery trout each spring and early summer, the lake also provides opportunities to catch bullhead catfish. Swimming is also quite popular on warm summer days as well as recreational boating, though no gas motors are allowed on the lake. Since the reservoir was created in 1960, there has been fear in Silverton that Silver Creek Dam might someday give way. Though structural engineers have declared the dam safe and deemed the conditions for a dam breach to be almost out of the realm of possibility, US Army Corps of Engineers studies have found that a collapse of the dam would be catastrophic to the city below.

Organizations that were part of Red Power Movement included American Indian Movement (AIM) and National Indian Youth Council (NIYC). This movement sought the rights for Native Americans to make policies and programs for themselves while maintaining and controlling their own land and resources. The Red Power movement took a confrontational and civil disobedience approach to inciting change in United States to Native American affairs compared to using negotiations and settlements, which national Native American groups such as National Congress of American Indians had before. Red Power centered around mass action, militant action, and unified action. The phrase \\"Red Power\\", attributed to the author Vine Deloria, Jr, commonly expressed a growing sense of pan-Indian identity in the late 1960s among American Indians in the United States. Events that were part of the movement include the Occupation of Alcatraz, the Trail of Broken Treaties, the Occupation of Wounded Knee, along with intermittent protests and occupations throughout the era. The lasting impression of the Red Power movement was the resurrection of American Indian pride, action, and awareness. Many bills and laws were also enacted in favor of American Indians in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most important being the reversal of tribe recognition termination.  Background  From 1953 to 1964, the United States government terminated recognition of more than 100 tribes and bands as sovereign dependent nations with the House Concurrent Resolution 108. This resolution stated that the tribes would be under US law and treated as American citizens instead of having the status as wards of the US. The affected tribes were no longer protected by the government and stripped of their right to govern their own people. The Relocation Act of 1956 resulted in as many as 750,000 American Indians migrating to cities during the period from 1950-1980. This Act was implemented to encourage and provide support for American Indians to find jobs in cities and improve their lives from the poverty-ridden reservations. The government offered vocational training, housing, and financial support for those who chose to relocate. These promised amenities were often not provided or inadequately provided, resulting in American Indians distanced from their cultural lands and economically worse off than before. The Relocation and Termination era described above fueled the resistance of American Indians. The oldest recognized National American Indian group was National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), established in 1944. NCAI set a precedent by successfully being the first multi-tribal political organization run entirely by Indians. NCAI fought against voting discrimination, against the termination of government to government relationship between the US and native tribes, and against US interference in tribal counsels. They aimed to close gaps between Indians who lived on reservations and those who had relocated to cities, elderly and Indian Youth, and different tribes from one another. NCAI was the main political organization that preceded the Red Power Movement.  Main organizations involved  = American Indian Movement = At the forefront of the Red Power Movement was American Indian Movement(AIM), which was founded in 1968 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Its members belonged to and represented mainly urban Indian communities, and its leaders were young and militant. Like the Black Panthers and Brown Berets, AIM was initially organized to work for Indian civil rights in cities. Its members monitored law enforcement practices, and worked to highlight and prevent police harassment and brutality. AIM soon played a major role in building a network of urban Indian centers, churches and philanthropic organizations. It helped establish the \\"powwow circuit,\\" which publicized news of protest activities across the country. Skillful in attracting attention from the news media, AIM inspired local chapters and writing about American Indian political issues. = National Indian Youth Council = The National Indian Youth Council(NIYC) was founded in 1961 by young American Indians who were college students or recent college graduates. They were one of the first militant Indian rights organizations following the conservative ways of the NCAI. NIYC were strong opponents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and got involved in many of the events in the Red Power Movement. Like AIM, the council believed in and fought for the recognition of tribes federally and reinstating tribal governance. = Women of All Red Nations = Women of All Red Nations (WARN) emerged in 1974 from the main founders, Lorelei DeCora Means, Madonna Thunderhawk, Phyllis Young, Janet McCloud, and others. WARN acted as a branch from AIM that focused on American Indian women's and family rights. Main issues that WARN fought against were the forced sterilization of Native women and the lack of adequate health services on the reservations. WARN took action by becoming involved in Indian custody battles, protesting mining companies who were poisoning food and water sources, and collecting data on Indian women who had been sterilized without consent. = International Indian Treaty Council = The International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) was founded in 1974 in Standing Rock, South Dakota. More than 98 Indigenous tribes were represented by over 5000 people at this first gathering. IITC grew into a voice for Indians internationally‚Äîcovering North, Central, and South America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. IITC focuses on the pursuit of sovereignty and self-determination for indigenous peoples through activism, training, and unified gatherings. As the first indigenous organization to be granted Consultive Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1977, IITC was able to represent the concerns and fight for the acknowledgement of indigenous rights to the UN.  Events  From 1969 to the Longest Walk of 1978, the Red Power Movement highlighted issues through social protest. Its goals were for the federal government to honor treaty obligations and provide financial \\"resources, education, housing and healthcare to alleviate poverty.\\"\\"Alcatraz Is Not an Island\\", Indian Activism, pbs.org, accessed 10 Nov 2009 The RPM wanted to gain Indian participation in social institutions; it was instrumental in supporting the founding of Indian colleges, as well as the creation of Indian studies programs at existing institutions, and the establishment of museums and cultural centers to celebrate Indian contributions. The 1960s marked the beginning of a \\"Native American Renaissance\\" in literature. New books such as Vine Deloria, Jr.'s Custer Died for Your Sins (1969) and the classic Black Elk Speaks (1961), reprinted from the 1930s, reached millions of readers inside and outside Indian communities. A wide variety of Indian writers, historians, and essayists gained publication following these successes and new authors were widely read. N. Scott Momaday won the Pulitzer Prize for one of his novels and Leslie Silko received acclaim. Fiction and nonfiction works about Indian life and lore have continued to attract a large audience. Authors such as Louise Erdrich and Michael Dorris have earned continued recognition. Since the late twentieth century, novels by Sherman Alexie have been adapted for film as well. = Occupation of Alcatraz = The Occupation of Alcatraz began on November 20, 1969 when more than 80 young, mostly college aged American Indians, who identified themselves as Indians of All Tribes (IAT) boarded boats to approach and occupy Alcatraz Island overnight. The young American Indians settled with the legal backing of a Sioux Treaty that named any federal \\"out of use\\" land available for Indians. The US federal government had closed the Alcatraz federal prison and the island was no longer in use as of 1962. This treaty was used to send the message that treaties are still relevant and should be honored. Sign in Alcatraz (1969) The occupation had been planned ahead of time by Adam Nordwall, a successful Indian businessman, and Richard Oakes, a San Francisco State student. The two agreed to and told sympathetic media outlets about their plan to take over Alcatraz at a dinner party hosted by San Francisco Chronicle reporter Tim Findley. They threatened that if there were any leaks of the story early, the plan to occupy Alcatraz would be called off. Their first attempt, on November 9, 1969‚Äîthe date the media had been told‚Äîresulted in circling the island in a boat with media coverage from all over the Bay Area. Although they did not begin the occupation that night, Oakes jumped off of the circling boat as others followed and swam to Alcatraz. After making it to Alcatraz, the young Indians were removed by Coast Guard that night but would be back in much larger numbers on November 20.During the occupation, IAT released a statement called the Alcatraz Proclamation which explained that the Indians had the right to Alcatraz Island due to the right to discovery. The Proclamation went on to describe the deserted prison island as comparable to the conditions of the Indian Reservations. IAT was also joined by National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) during the Alcatraz movement and the growing group of young, educated, and passionate American Indians made their presence known in the media. Richard Oakes became the public figure for the occupation and participated in the press conferences for releases of documents such as the Alcatraz Proclamation and goals for the island which included building cultural centers, educational facilities, and recreational spaces for Indians to be together as Indians. The Occupation of Alcatraz ended after a series of disorienting events on the island. The January 1970 death of Richard Oakes' 13-year-old stepdaughter due to falling from a building brought Richard and his wife Anne back to the mainland. Some of the student occupiers went back to school when the Oakes' left. A problem of drug and alcohol abuse also became prominent on the island, which affected the occupations reputation. The remaining leaders were John Trudell, LaNada Means, and Stella Leach, who could not end up agreeing on a way to further develop the occupation. Electricity and water being cut off to the island by May, and a suspicious fire that burned three buildings were further factors that led to the dismantling of the occupation. Protestors continued to depart from the island during the downward spiral. On June 11, 1971 a large number of police officers used force to remove the remaining few protestors. Although the protesters ultimately failed to achieve their specific goals, they helped catalyze the Indian community. With the occupation of Alcatraz, a participant said, \\"we got back our worth, our pride, our dignity, our humanity.\\" = Occupation of D-Q University = With young, college aged students at the center of many Red Power movement protests, the pursuit of higher education, particularly for American Indians became a main initiative. In 1970, while the Alcatraz occupation was still occurring, a group of Indian youth took over US military surplus land near Davis, California. These youth had applied for the land but were denied access after UC Davis was granted access, regardless of UC Davis' legally incomplete application. In retaliation, the youth hopped the fences onto the property leading to the establishment and occupation of D-Q University. D-Q University became the first tribal university that was established in California, and the first that was not affiliated with a single reservation. A deed was granted to the student occupation in April 1971. Since then, D-Q University became part of the Tribal Colleges and Universities and received accreditation in 1977. The curriculum of D-Q University included cultural and traditional focused education in order to educate Indians about Indians. The university struggled to keep enrollment rates up and secure funding, which resulted in the ultimate loss of accreditation in 2005. However, the occupation that created D-Q University highlighted the importance of higher education for American Indians to the Red Power Movement. = Trail of Broken Treaties = BIA seal In August 1972, the Red Power movement continued under the direction of American Indian Movement(AIM) with the trail of broken treaties. The trail of broken treaties, a play on the \\"Trail of Tears,\\" was the migration of seven caravans from areas across the west coast to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Washington D.C. The BIA had become widely associated with corruption and not acting in the best interest of the American Indians. The protestors started arriving in D.C. on November 1 with the intent of bringing a list of twenty demands to the BIA. Upon arrival, the activists and GSA security had a misunderstanding about the activists being housed in the BIA building. This resulted in the activists overpowering the security and taking over the building. The American Indians then barricaded the doors, with furniture from the BIA they had broken apart, and the occupation began on November 2, 1972. This occupation of the BIA had started the week before the presidential election, making a D.C. occupation the center of media attention. Threats of police force were used daily against the Indians if they did not come out. Supporters from outside of the occupation would come to the BIA to create a human barricade keeping the police from entering the occupied building. On November 6, a judge had given an order for the occupiers to vacate the building before 6 pm that day or they would be forcibly evicted. As the Indians braced for eviction, some exited the building to create a perimeter around it with clubs, spears and other weaponry to resist. Others inside the building were rumored to have guns and explosives awaiting the invasion of GSA officials. The spokesman of the occupation, Russel Means, spoke on the front stairs of the BIA explaining that the occupation would end when their demands had been met, and no time sooner. The deadline for the Indians to leave was pushed back yet again to November 8. Before this date, Indian lawyers had discovered evidence that would essentially abolish the BIA with exposure of corruption and misuse of the program. On November 8, the protestors left the BIA building with paintings, artifacts, and $2 million worth of damage. = Wounded Knee = The Wounded Knee Incident started on February 27, 1973 and lasted 71 days. More than 200 Indians in support of the Oglala Sioux people of Pine Ridge Reservation took over the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota. The Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO), a group of mostly full-Indian women that lived on Pine Ridge Reservation had been unsuccessful in a trial to impeach Dick Wilson, who was the chairman of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council. Critics of Wilson claimed he was too close to white people, too cozy with the government, and was disrespecting his Oglala Sioux culture. Enraged that Wilson had not been impeached, OSCRO continued to gather and brainstorm a response. They decided to ask AIM for help in reacting to what they felt was an injustice. With AIM in the picture, occupying Wounded Knee was their final decision. Wounded Knee was chosen as a tribute to the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890, where hundreds of Lakota Indians were killed by the 7th US Cavalry Regiment in reported efforts to disarm the Indians. As a historical remembrance of the massacre, the town had visitor trade posts dedicated to the grave sites of the Indians that many Indians thought were disrespectful and used for commercial purposes. The owners of the trade posts would sell native Indian crafts for more than they had bought them and had a history of racism towards the local Indians. The occupiers attacked the trade posts first to accumulate the ammunitions and weaponry that were held there. The occupation formed to deliver a message that American Indians would not sit around peacefully as treaties were broken, unfair trials were given, and their land was ceded. Federal agents gathered around Wounded Knee while the occupiers would host events for the media to cover in order to promote their message. Throughout the occupation of Wounded Knee, the protestors and federal agents would often have shootouts at night. The Indians would be shooting from inside Wounded Knee and the federal agents from the outside perimeter they had formed. From these shootouts, two Indians were killed and one federal agent was permanently paralyzed. The death of the second Indian, who was from the Pine Ridge Reservation and an Oglala Sioux, Buddy Lamont, led many Indians to seek an end to the violent occupation. On May 8, 1973 the American Indians surrendered to the surrounding federal agents after 10 weeks. Russell Means, one of the more recognized leaders of the AIM, negotiated with U.S. forces to release the hostages on the premises that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold hearings on the Indian treaties that were broken by the U.S. government as well as investigations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and its members' attention to the living conditions at Pine Ridge. This event is not only significant because it was one of the first violent acts initiated first by the Natives, but it also led to generations of Indians getting involved in civil rights and tribal affairs. The Nixon administration had earlier declared that it had wanted to end the \\"revolutionary Indian element\\", but because so many Natives took notice and began to make changes in the local governments controlling their reservations, the administration failed to end their protests and stopped trying to interfere. Russell Means and Dennis Banks, the two AIM leaders mostly in charge of Wounded Knee II, were arrested immediately after the hostages were released. However, on September 16, 1973, the charges were dropped and they were dismissed on the account that the U.S. government had unlawfully influenced witnesses and tampered with evidence. The violence of these types of protests then continued through the rest of the 1970s. = List of occupations by Red Power activists = The following is a list of occupations by Red Power activists: * Occupation of Alcatraz- San Francisco, CA (1969) * Occupations of Argonne National Laboratory, Wrigley Field, Belmont Harbor Nike - Chicago, IL (early 1970s) * Occupation of Winter Dam- Winter, WI (1971) * Occupation of abandoned Nike Missile Field- Richmond, CA (1971) * Occupation of abandoned Coast Guard station- Milwaukee, WI (1971) * Occupation of BIA- Washington D.C. (1972) * Occupation of Wounded Knee- Wounded Knee, SD (1973)  Legacy  The Red Power movement had accomplished many of its goals by the time direct social activism declined in the late 1970s. \\"By the early 1980s, over 100 Indian studies programs had been created in the United States. Tribal museums opened.\\" Among the most prominent of the cultural centers is the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), which was sponsored by Hawaii's senator Daniel Inouye and authorized by the US Congress in 1989. The NMAI opened on the Mall in Washington, DC in 2004. It also has a branch at the former US Customs House, on the Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan. Many laws were passed in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most notable being the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, which reversed the termination of federal tribe recognition. This act restored the recognition and government to government status to tribes, giving them control to govern their own tribes and reservations with funding provided by the government if they followed certain guidelines. Since the termination of Indian tribe recognition was a major catalyst to start the movement, regaining recognition was considered a huge success for RPM. = Laws passed in favor of American Indians during the Red Power movement = The following laws were passed during the movement: * Indian Education Act of 1972 provided additional funds to school districts with high populations of Indian children * Indian Health Service budget doubled from 1970 to 1975, which provided funding for Indian hospitals and clinics. * Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC) was established in 1975, as a result of fish-in protests. The NWIFC consists of members from 20 tribes who are recognized as natural resources co-managers with the State of Washington. * Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 was passed by Congress to improve the health-care system for American Indians. This act includes scholarships for American Indians who are looking to pursue studies in medicine, dentistry, psychiatry, nursing and pharmacy. * American Indian Religious Freedom Act was passed in 1978 and terminated the outlaw of Indian religious practices such as sun dance, bear dance, and the use of sweat lodges. * Branch of Acknowledgement and Research (BAR) was created by the BIA in 1978 to process applications from tribes for federal recognition. BAR was never federally approved, but still is in control of recognizing Indian tribes. * Indian Child Welfare Act was passed by Congress in 1978. This act was in response to years of the BIA placing Indian children in boarding schools away from their reservations. It allows tribes to have some control over adoption and placement of Indian orphan children. * Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 authorized community colleges to exist on reservations See also *American Indian Movement *Black Power movement *Chiapas conflict *Chicano movement *Civil Rights Movement References Further reading *Paul Chaat Smith & Robert Allen Warrior, Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee (The New Press, 1997) Category:American Indian Movement Category:Civil rights and liberties Category:History of social movements Category:Indigenous politics in North America Category:Indigenous rights Category:Minority rights Category:Native American history Category:Native American nationalism Category:Rebellions in the United States ","title":"Red Power movement"},{"id":"7963679","text":"USS Benevolence (AH-13) a United States Navy Hospital Ship, was built as SS Marine Lion in 1944 by Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., in Chester, Pennsylvania, under a Maritime Commission contract.

Post war Upon VJ Day, Benevolence was with the Allied fleet in Tokyo Harbor during the Surrender of Japan. She anchored off Yokosuka, Japan, 29 August to begin processing liberated Allied prisoners of war where she screened 1520 prisoners of war. She remained in Japanese waters until 27 November 1945 and then returned wounded to the United States, arriving in San Francisco on 12 December 1945. She served as a casualty evacuation ship between Pearl Harbor and San Francisco from December until February 1946 and then underwent an overhaul until 1 April 1946.

(Low socioeconomic status is almost universally associated with worse population health and higher death rates everywhere in the world.) The paradox usually refers in particular to low mortality among Latinos in the United States relative to non-Hispanic Whites. First coined the Hispanic Epidemiological Paradox in 1986 by Kyriakos Markides, the phenomenon is also known as the Latino Epidemiological Paradox. According to Markides, a professor of sociomedical sciences at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, this paradox was ignored by past generations, but is now \\"the leading theme in the health of the Hispanic population in the United States.\\" The specific cause of the phenomenon is poorly understood, although the decisive factor appears to be place of birth, raising the possibility that differing birthing or neonatal practices might be involved via a lack of breastfeeding combined with birth trauma imprinting (both common in American obstetrics) and consequent mental and physical illness, the latter compounded by the impact of psychological problems on the capacity for social networking. It appears that the Hispanic Paradox cannot be explained by either the \\"salmon bias hypothesis\\" or the \\"healthy migrant effect,\\" two theories that posit low mortality among immigrants due to, respectively, a possible tendency for sick immigrants to return to their home country before death and a possible tendency for new immigrants to be unusually healthy compared to the rest of their home-country population. Historical differences in smoking habits by ethnicity and place of birth may explain much of the paradox, at least at adult ages. Others have proposed that the lower mortality of Hispanics could reflect a slower biological aging rate of Hispanics. However, some believe that there is no Hispanic Paradox, and that inaccurate counting of Hispanic deaths in the United States leads to an underestimate of Hispanic or Latino mortality.  Statistical findings  =Mortality= Though they are often at lower socioeconomic standing, most Hispanic groups, excepting Puerto Ricans, demonstrate lower or equal levels of mortality to their non-Hispanic White counterparts. The Center for Disease Control reported in 2003 that Hispanic‚Äôs mortality rate was 25 percent lower than non-Hispanic whites and 43 percent lower than African Americans. This mortality advantage most commonly found among middle-aged and elderly Hispanics. The death rates of Hispanics to non- Hispanic whites was found to exceed 1.00 in the twenties, decreases by age 45, then is severely reduced to 0.75‚Äì.90 by at age 65, persisting until death. When controlling for socioeconomic factors, the health advantage gap for Mexican Americans, the largest Hispanic population in the US, increases noticeably. Hispanics do not have a mortality advantage over non-Hispanic Whites in all mortality rates; they have higher rates for mortality from liver disease, cervical cancer, AIDS, homicide (males), and diabetes. =Infant mortality= Another important indicator of health is the infant mortality rate, which is also either equal or better in Hispanic Americans than in non- Hispanic Americans. A study by Hummer, et al. found that infants born to Mexican Immigrant women in the United States have about a 10 percent lower mortality in the first hour, first day, and first week than that of infants born to non-Hispanic white, U.S.-born women. In 2003, the national Hispanic infant mortality rate was found to be 5.7, nearly equal to that of non- Hispanic white Americans and 58 percent lower than that of African Americans. Hispanic immigrants also have a 20 percent lower infant mortality rate than that of U.S.-born Hispanics, though the latter population usually has a higher income and education, and are much more likely to have health insurance.  Reasons for the paradox  = Socio-economic factors = According to Alder and Estrove (2006), the more socioeconomically advantaged individuals are, the better their health. Access to health insurance and preventative medical services are one of the main reasons for socioeconomic health disparities. Economic hardship within the household can cause distress and affect parenting, causing health problems among children leading to depression, substance abuse, and behavior problems. Low socioeconomic status is correlated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Mental health disorders are an important health problem for those of low socioeconomic status; they are two to five times more likely to suffer from a diagnosable disorder than those of high socioeconomic status, and are more likely to face barriers to getting treatment. Furthermore, this lack of treatment for mental disorders can affect educational and employment opportunities and achievement. = Residential segregation = Important to the understanding of migrant community health is the increasingly stratified American society, manifested in residential segregation. Beginning in the 1970s, the low to moderate levels of income segregation in the United States began to degrade. As the rich became richer, so did their neighborhoods. This trend was inversely reflected in the poor, as their neighborhoods became poorer. As sociologist Douglas Massey explains, ‚ÄúAs a result, poverty and affluence both became more concentrated geographically.‚Äù Professor of public administration and economics John Yinger writes that ‚Äúone way for poor people to win the spatial competition for housing is to rent small or low-quality housing.‚Äù However, he continues, low-quality housing often features serious health risks such as lead paint and animal pests. Though lead-based paint was deemed illegal in 1978, it remains on the walls of older apartments and houses, posing a serious neurological risk to children. Asthma, a possible serious health risk, also has a clear link to poverty. Moreover, asthma attacks have been associated with certain aspects of poor housing quality such as the presence of cockroaches, mice, dust, dust mites, mold, and mildew. The 1997 American Housing Survey found that signs of rats or mice are almost twice as likely to be detected in poor households as in non- poor households.  Hypotheses  =Barrio advantage= One hypothesis for the Hispanic Paradox proposes that living in the same neighborhood as people with similar ethnic backgrounds confers significant advantages to one‚Äôs health. In a study of elderly Mexican-Americans, those living in areas with a higher percentage of Mexican-Americans had lower seven-year mortality as well as a decreased prevalence of medical conditions, including stroke, cancer, and hip fracture. Despite these neighborhoods' relatively high rates of poverty due to lack of formal education and a preponderance of low paying service sector jobs, residents do not suffer from the same mortality and morbidity levels seen in similarly disadvantaged socioeconomic neighborhoods. These neighborhoods do have intact family structures, community institutions, and kinship structures that span households, all of which are thought to provide significant benefits to an individual‚Äôs health. These social network support structures are especially important to the health of the elderly population as they deal with declining physical function. Another reason for this phenomenon could be that those Hispanic-Americans that live among those of similar cultural and social backgrounds are shielded from some of the negative effects of assimilation to American culture. =Acculturation= The extent of a Hispanic American‚Äôs acculturation in the United States, or their assimilation to mainstream American culture, is relative to his or her health. One of the main negative effects of acculturation on health has been on substance abuse. More assimilated Latinos have higher rates of illicit drug use, alcohol consumption, and smoking, especially among women. Another negative effect of acculturation is changes in diet and nutrition. More acculturated Latinos eat less fruits, vegetables, vitamins, fiber and protein and consume more fat than their less acculturated counterparts. One of the most significant impacts of acculturation on Latino health is birth outcomes. Studies have found that more acculturated Latinas have higher rates of low birthweight, premature births, teenage pregnancy and undesirable prenatal and postnatal behaviors such as smoking or drinking during pregnancy, and lower rates of breastfeeding. Acculturation and greater time in the United States has also been associated with negative mental health impacts. US-born Latinos or long term residents of the United States had higher rates of mental illness than recent Latino immigrants. In addition, foreign-born Mexican Americans are at significantly lower risk of suicide and depression than those born in the United States. The increased rates of mental illness is thought to be due to increased distress associated with alienation, discrimination and Mexican Americans attempting to advance themselves economically and socially stripping themselves of traditional resources and ethnically-based social support. =Healthy migrant effect= The ‚Äúhealthy migrant effect‚Äù hypothesizes that the selection of healthy Hispanic immigrants into the United States is reason for the paradox. International immigration statistics demonstrate that the mortality rate of immigrants is lower than in their country of origin. In the United States, foreign-born individuals have better self-reported health than American-born respondents. Furthermore, Hispanic immigrants have better health than those living in the US for a long amount of time. =Salmon Bias= A second popular hypothesis, called the ‚ÄúSalmon Bias‚Äù, attempts to factor in the occurrence of returning home. This hypothesis purports that many Hispanic people return home after temporary employment, retirement, or severe illness, meaning that their deaths occur in their native land and are not taken into account by mortality reports in the United States. This hypothesis considers those people as ‚Äústatistically immortal‚Äù because they artificially lower the Hispanic mortality rate. Certain studies hint that it could be reasonable. These studies report that though return migration, both temporary and permanent, depend upon specific economic and social situations in communities, up to 75 percent of household in immigrant neighborhoods do some kind of return migration from the U.S. However, Abraido-Lanza, et al. found in 1999 that the ‚ÄúSalmon Hypothesis‚Äù cannot account for the lower mortality of Hispanics in the US because, according to their findings, the Hispanic paradox is still present when non-returning migrants are observed (e.g. Cubans). =Slow biological aging= Horvath et al. (2013) have proposed that the lower mortality of Hispanics could reflect a slower biological aging rate of Hispanics. This hypothesis is based on the finding that blood and saliva from Hispanics ages more slowly than that of non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, and other populations according to a biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock. Comparison with other ethnicities One of the most important aspects of this phenomenon is the comparison of Hispanics' health to non-Hispanic African Americans' health. Both the current and historical poverty rates for Hispanic and non-Hispanic African American populations in the United States are consistently starkly higher than that of non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian Americans. Dr. Hector Flores explains that ‚ÄúYou can predict in the African‚ÄìAmerican population, for example, a high infant-mortality rate, so we would think a [similar] poor minority would have the same health outcomes.‚Äù However, he said, the health poor outcomes are not present in the Hispanic population. For example, the age-adjusted mortality rate for Hispanics living in Los Angeles County was 52 percent less than the blacks living in the same county. Comparison to Non-Hispanic White Americans Although Hispanic Americans are twice more likely to be living under the poverty line and three times more likely to not have health insurance than Non-Hispanic White Americans, they have a longer life span than them by 3 years. More Hispanics, than any other racial group, are uninsured and are in general less likely to use medical care. The median life span of Hispanic Americans is an average of 81.8 years and Non-Hispanic White Americans have an average of 78.8 years . This could be explained from scientist taking DNA samples from multiple ethnic groups, the blood from Latino aged more slowly than any other group. It is also found that Hispanics, when first migrating to the US, have lower smoking rates, better diet and general health. Hispanic infant mortality is also less than NHWs with an average of 5.8 per 1000 births and 9.1 per 1000 births for Non- Hispanic Whites. Through the statistics shown of Hispanics and NHW's with cancer, we can see it as a clear example of The Hispanic Paradox. In 2012, new cancer cases of all sites among Hispanic men and Non-Hispanic men had a ratio of 0.7, Hispanic men having 362.2 and Non-Hispanic men having 489.9 In comparison to Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic men are 10 percent less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Hispanic women, compared to NHW, were found to be 30 percent less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Criticism Some public health researchers have argued that the Hispanic paradox is not actually a national phenomenon in the United States. In 2006, Smith and Bradshaw argued that no Hispanic paradox exists. They maintain that life expectancies were nearly equal for non-Hispanic White and Hispanic females, but less close for non-Hispanic White and Hispanic Males. Turra and Goldman argue that the paradox is concentrated among the foreign born from specific national origins, and is only present in those of middle to older ages. At younger ages, they explain, deaths are highly related to environmental factors such as homicides and accidents. Deaths at older ages, they maintain, are more related to detrimental health-related behaviors and health status at younger ages. Therefore, immigration-related processes only offer survival protection to those at middle and older ages; the negative impact of assimilation into poor neighborhoods is higher on the mortality of immigrants at a younger age. In contrast, Palloni and Arias hypothesize that this phenomenon is most likely caused by across-the-board bias in underestimating mortality rates, caused by ethnic misidentification or an overstatement of ages. These errors could also be related to mistakes in matching death records to the National Health Interview Survey, missing security numbers, or complex surnames. Although it may not mean progress for all Hispanics, NPR.org claims some Hispanic migrant's lifestyles have been drastically improving within the United States due to Latino unemployment being at an all-time low of 4.2 percent. The low unemployment rates have enabled families like the one talked about in the NPR.org article to have multiple streams of income by work more than one job.

Two men shot dead four people and wounded seven more, before being killed by police and military officers. Though politically and religiously motivated, the men were not members of any sanctioned armed force and the attacks were criminal. The two men were later identified as Muslim \\"Ghans\\" from colonial India (some sources incorrectly identify them as Turkish).\\"Battle of Broken Hill\\" , George Negus Tonight, ABC-TV, 23 February 2004 The assailants The attackers were both former camel-drivers working at Broken Hill. They were Badsha Mahommed Gool (born c. 1874), an ice-cream vendor, and Mullah Abdullah (born c. 1854), a local imam and halal butcher. Gool's ice-cream cart was well known in town and was used to transport the men to the attack site. They also fashioned a home- made Ottoman flag which they flew. There appears to have been little effort made at hiding their identities. Abdullah had arrived in Broken Hill around 1898 and worked as a camel driver. Several days before the killings Mullah Adbullah was convicted by Police Court for slaughtering sheep on premises not licensed for slaughter. It was not his first offence.The Argus, 2 January 1915 Since the sanitary inspector, Mr. Brosnan, acting to enforce the municipal regulations, observed that the unauthorised slaughter was insanitary, he acted to enforce the law. In addition, Abdullah had ceased wearing his turban years before, \\"since the day some larrikin threw stones at me, and I did not like it\\".The Argus, 6 January 1915 Attack Each New Year's Day the local lodge of the Manchester Unity Order of Oddfellows held a picnic at Silverton. The train from Broken Hill to Silverton was crowded with 1200 picnickers on 40 open ore trucks. Three kilometres out of town, Gool and Abdullah positioned themselves on an embankment located about 30 metres from the tracks. As the train passed they opened fire with two rifles, discharging 20 to 30 shots. The picnickers initially thought that the shots were being discharged in honour of the train's passing, as a sham fight, or as target practice. Once their companions started falling, the reality sank in. Alma Cowie, aged 17 died instantly. William John Shaw, a foreman in the Sanitary Department, was killed on the train and his daughter Lucy Shaw was injured. Six other people on the train were injured: Mary Kavanagh, George Stokes, Thomas Campbell, Alma Crocker, Rose Crabb and Constable Robert Mills.The Barrier Miner, 2 January 1915. The conductor on the train was \\"Tiger\\" Dick (Eric Edward) Nyholm, soon to be a father of six children, including Sir Ronald Nyholm, also of Broken Hill. Nyholm was a renowned marksman and proved instrumental in protecting the train's passengers from further injury. Police response Gool and Mullah Abdullah made their way from the train towards the West Camel camp where they lived. On the way they killed Alfred E. Millard who had taken shelter in his hut. By this time the train had pulled over at a siding and the police were telephoned. The police contacted Lieutenant Resch at the local army base who despatched his men. When police encountered Gool and Abdullah near the Cable Hotel, the pair shot and wounded Constable Mills. Gool and Abdullah then took shelter within a white quartz outcrop, which provided good cover. A 90-minute gun battle followed, during which armed members of the public arrived to join the police and military. By the end of the battle very little shooting came from the pair and most of it was off target, leading Constable Ward to conclude that Mullah Abdullah was already dead and Gool was wounded. James Craig, a 69-year-old occupant of a house behind the Cable Hotel, resisted his daughter's warning about chopping wood during a gun battle and was hit by a stray bullet and killed. He was the fourth to die. At \\"one o'clock a rush took place to the Turks' stronghold\\". An eyewitness later stated that Gool had stood with a white rag tied to his rifle but was cut down by gunfire. He was found with 16 wounds. The mob would not allow Abdullah's body to be taken away in the ambulance. Later that day both bodies were disposed of in secret by the police. Aftermath =Immediate events= The attackers left notes connecting their actions to the hostilities between the Ottoman and British Empires, which had been officially declared in October 1914. Believing he would be killed, Gool Mahomed left a letter in his waist-belt which stated that he was a subject of the Ottoman Sultan and that, \\"I must kill you and give my life for my faith, AllƒÅhu Akbar.\\" Mullah Abdullah said in his last letter that he was dying for his faith and in obedience to the order of the Sultan, \\"but owing to my grudge against Chief Sanitary Inspector Brosnan it was my intention to kill him first.\\"Stevens, Christine. Tin Mosques and Ghantowns; A History of Afghan Cameldrivers in Australia. Oxford University Press. Melbourne 1989, p. 163 Turkish sources claim that the letter from the Ottoman Sultan was a forgery, and that the Turkish flag found with the perpetrators was planted. It is claimed that the incident was attributed to Turks in order to rally the Australian public for the war. The actions were seen as representative of enemy aliens and Germans in the area were the focus of violence, as it was believed that the Germans had agitated the assailants to attack. On the evening of Friday 1 January an angry mob burnt the local German Club to the ground, cutting the hoses of the firemen who came to fight the flames. Afterwards, the mob marched over to a nearby camp used by Afghan camel drivers, but were prevented from attacking the settlement by the police and military. There was no further violence against the Afghan community. The next day the mines of Broken Hill fired all employees deemed enemy aliens under the 1914 Commonwealth War Precautions Act. Six Austrians, four Germans and one Turk were ordered out of town by the public. Shortly afterwards, all enemy aliens in Australia were interned for the duration of the war.Jones, Mary Lucille. \\"The Years of Decline: Australian Muslims 1900‚Äì1940\\", in Mary Lucille Jones (ed) An Australian pilgrimage: Muslims in Australia from the Seventeenth Century to the Present. Victoria Press in association with the Museum of Victoria. p. 64 On Sunday 3 January thousands of people assembled in Broken Hill to witness the funerals of the four victims. The Silverton Tramway Company refunded in full the fares for the picnic train, and the money was used to launch a public relief fund. =German Propaganda= The Sydney journal The Bulletin published a burlesque of the incident in the style of German propaganda, suggesting the Germans lauded the attack as a victorious military battle between Turkish forces and recruits on a troop train. supposedly the Turkish attackers killed 40 and wounded 70 (ten times the real figures) for the loss of only two dead. The parody was, for some reason, taken seriously by other newspapers, which published it almost verbatim a genuine example of German propaganda. The story was picked up by international papers in the US, the UK and NZ. When clippings from the foreign papers filtered back to Australia in the letters home of serving soldiers, it only reinforced the belief that the story in the Bulletin was true. The 'fake news' was revived as an example of German mendacity by Australian papers during the Second World War and even as late as 1951 in Broken Hill's own Barrier Daily Truth paper.Whyte, Brendan. \\"Propaganda eats itself: The Bulletin and the battle of Broken Hill\\".

Sigmund Freud used this term to describe the sexual disposition from infancy to about age five. Freud's theory Freud theorized that some are born with unfocused pleasure / libidinal drives, deriving pleasure from any part of the body. The objects and modes of pleasurable satisfaction are multifarious, directed at every object that might provide pleasure. Polymorphous perverse sexuality continues from infancy through about age five, progressing through three distinct developmental stages: the oral stage, anal stage, and genital / phallic stage. Only in subsequent developmental stages do children learn to constrain drives towards pleasure-satisfaction to socially accepted norms, culminating in adult heterosexual behavior focused on the genitals and reproduction or sublimations of the procreative drive. Freud thought that during this stage of undifferentiated impulse for pleasure, incestuous and bisexual urges are normal. Lacking knowledge that certain modes of gratification are forbidden, the polymorphously perverse child seeks gratification wherever it occurs. In the earliest phase, the oral phase, the child forms a libidinal bond with the mother via the inherent pleasure gained from suckling at the breast. For Freud, \\"perversion\\" is a non-judgmental term. He used it to designate behavior outside the socially acceptable norms of his era.

When a node wants to transmit, it sends a signal called Request-To-Send (RTS) with the length of the data frame to send. If the receiver allows the transmission, it replies the sender a signal called Clear-To-Send (CTS) with the length of the frame that is about to receive.

The ZIP code is 94019 and the community is inside area code 650. Profile This area was inhabited by Ohlone tribes in pre-Columbian times. According to mission records, the Chiguan Ohlones, who numbered about 50, called the place Ssatumnumo, and had a second village, Chagunte, near Half Moon Bay.Historic Resource Study for Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Mateo County, p. 26 Because of the special microhabitat of the adjacent Pillar Point Harbor, there are numerous pelagic birds that visit the local area.

Background On September 29, 2004 the City Council of Winnipeg voted to abandon plans for a bus rapid transit (BRT) system for Winnipeg. Several weeks later, Dallas Hansen returned to his home town of Winnipeg and discovered the online message board, NewWinnipeg.com. Among the thread topics, some were about rapid transit in Winnipeg. Dallas had posted his opinions of the BRT plan and had also discovered, around the same time, a website that Jim Jaworski had created about local Transit issues, including the subway plan published by Norman D. Wilson. He wrote an op-ed piece published in the Winnipeg Free Press on November 29, 2004 -- Mass Transit Best Route for Winnipeg. Several more months had passed, and Dallas, Jim, Jeff Lowe, and another person who was interested in the re-urbanization of central Winnipeg, Robert Galston, had decided it was time to form a new Transit rider group. A previous transit rider group formed by Jim Jaworski and others in the late 1990s had fizzled because there was never a consensus over the form of rapid transit Winnipeg should have, while others believed that Winnipeg doesn't need rapid transit at all. The TRUWinnipeg website domain was registered in early July 2005 and contains several archival and new articles and photos about the reurbanification of downtown Winnipeg. June 2008 had the group's website viewed by 2,070 individuals, a new record.

The Boston-based group's first album, titled Avoid One Thing, was released in 2002 on Side One Dummy Records. The album was written and recorded almost solely by Gittleman. Gittleman assembled a band with which to tour and play his music. Before the release of the band's next album in 2004, the band went through several lineup changes. John Lynch joined the band after Dave Karcich's death due to a sudden brain aneurysm. Later, Delano left and the band continued as a three-piece.

Since that time, Griffin has been playing guitar for Darkbuster and Gittleman has moved to Los Angeles and is once again a member of the reunited Bosstones. Paul Delano underwent emergency surgery in 2006 and a series of benefit shows were held. John Lynch has since joined up with David Minehan and is now playing drums for The Neighborhoods. The Bouncing Souls covered the song \\"Lean on Sheena\\" on their 2006 The Gold Record. The band got back together and released a new record in September 2019 titled \\"Right Here Where You Left Me\\" on Big Rig Records.

He is the son of Bryan Martyn who also played for North Melbourne and is a relative of early Carlton champion Paddy O'Brien. He is an AFL life member. After retiring from the AFL Mick played a season with Spotswood in the W.R.F.L. Early life Martyn was born with a cleft palate disorder which did not allow him to speak normally or fluently. He attended St. Paul's College in North Altona. North Melbourne Football Club Martyn was drafted to the Kangaroos under the father-son rule. He notched up his first league game against Geelong but did not come on until the third quarter where he lined up on Gary Ablett, Sr. In 1995 he was awarded the Michael Tuck Medal after the Kangaroos beat the Adelaide Crows in the 1995 Ansett Cup. In 2002 he gained permission by the AFL to wear his father's number 30 jumper, as it would be the last match his father ever witnessed before dying a few days later. Martyn won two premierships with the Kangaroos in 1996 and 1999 until he was delisted by the Kangaroos at the end of the 2002 season. Bali Bombings Martyn was injured in the 2002 Bali bombings where he received burns to the back of his scalp.http://www.theage.com.au/cgi- bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2002/10/15/1034561155706.html He had been drinking with Jason McCartney at Paddy's bar at the time of the attack. After exiting the building, he and McCartney left the scene and were admitted to hospital, McCartney suffering more life-threatening injuries. Carlton Football Club At the 2002 draft, with Denis Pagan needing a \\"gorilla\\" at full-back, Martyn was drafted by Carlton to play for the 2003 season. He played a handful of games to notch up his 300th match against Essendon in round 18 2003 at the MCG where Carlton lost by 34 points; after the match he was chaired off the ground. However, that turned out to be his last match; he announced his retirement after the serious injury he suffered the next week at training. He did cause some controversy during the year, commenting on radio that after the Bali Bombings \\"it wasn't the blue and white in my corner, it was the navy blue\\".

With a bed capacity of 750 and a complement of 564, the Repose departed Norfolk on 8 July 1945 for the Pacific. Serving as a casualty transport from various ports in the Pacific Ocean, the Repose also served as a base hospital ship in Shanghai and later Tsingtao, China supporting the occupation forces in northern China. Repose remained in Asian waters, with an occasional return trip to the States until July 1949. She was decommissioned, in reserve, at San Francisco on 19 January 1950. Repose was activated on 26 August 1950 and sailed for Pusan Korea, picking up the navy crew in Yokosuka, Japan en route. Serving in Korean waters and evacuating patients to Japanese ports as necessary, the Repose remained on station until early 1954 with a short repair period in San Francisco from February to March 1953 and the installation of a helicopter landing pad. She remained at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard until her transfer to the Naval Reserve Fleet on 27 September 1954; and she was decommissioned on 21 December 1954 at Hunters Point Naval Ship Yard. After nearly 11 years in reserve at Suisun Bay, Repose was recommissioned on 16 October 1965 for service in Vietnam. Arriving on 3 January 1966, she was permanently deployed to Southeast Asia and earned the nickname ‚ÄúAngel of the Orient.‚Äù Operating mainly in the I Corps area, she treated over 9,000 battle casualties and 24,000 inpatients while deployed. Notably, USS Repose was on station during the 1967 USS Forrestal fire that killed 134 sailors and injured 161. Her medical staff also treated legendary marksman Staff Sergeant Carlos Hathcock in September 1969 after he and seven other U.S. Marines suffered extensive burns from an anti-tank mine blast. The Repose departed Vietnam 14 March 1970 and was decommissioned in May 1970 and used as a hospital annex for Long Beach Naval Hospital. This proved uneconomical and she was sold for scrap in 1975.

She was used by the Union Navy as a hospital ship in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways. Purchase The Ben Morgan was a ship rigged (not schooner), sailing vessel launched at Philadelphia in 1826. Some sources state that this vessel was at one time named \\"Mediator\\" but evidence of that is lacking. Prior to being in government service this vessel was engaged in the whale fishery out of New London, CT starting in 1843. She completed five whaling voyages. At that time she was listed in whale fishery records as the Benjamin Morgan, which indicates this was her proper name. The Benjamin Morgan was purchased at New York City by the Navy on May 27, 1861. In naval records her name appears shortened, perhaps never officially, as \\"Ben Morgan.\\" She also appears as \\"Ben Morgan\\" in the 1861 and 1862 shipping registers. However, naval yard surveys of the vessel at the National Archives in College Park give her name as \\"Benjamin Morgan\\" as do letters of those who were later aboard her in naval service. No logs for this ship have survived, and no record of her commissioning ceremony ‚Äî if any indeed occurred ‚Äî has been found. Nevertheless, Ben Morgan was fitted out as a hospital ship and was sent to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to take over the role of the Norfolk Naval Hospital which had fallen into Confederate hands when Union forces evacuated Norfolk, Virginia, on April 20, 1861, three days after the Virginia convention had voted for secession. Hampton Roads hospital ship Commanded by Master James B. Gordon, the ship lay anchored in Hampton Roads as she cared for sick and wounded sailors from the Union warships blockading the Confederate coast. She also served concurrently as a collier and supply ship. Possibly the highlight of her medical service began on March 8, 1862 when she received on board men who had been wounded during the deadly foray into Hampton Roads of CSS Virginia, the former Federal screw frigate which Union officers had put to the torch and scuttled just before abandoning the Norfolk Navy Yard almost a year before. Raised, rebuilt, protected by a thick covering of iron plates, and armed with a sharp, strong prow, the Southern ironclad ram had proved to be almost impervious to shot and shell as she destroyed Union frigates and and damaged other Federal warships before withdrawing for the night. Monitor and the Virginia That evening, , arrived in Hampton Roads and prepared to challenge Virginia upon her return. Built with a flat deck and an extremely low freeboard, Monitors hull above the waterline was protected by strong iron plate which, the following day, enabled her to fight her Southern ironclad opponent to a standstill. This action saved the remaining Union fleet at Hampton Roads ‚Äî including Ben Morgan ‚Äî from almost certain destruction, maintained the blockade, and enabled the threatened Union Army of the Potomac to continue its drive toward Richmond, Virginia. Peninsula Campaign These developments prompted the Confederates to evacuate Norfolk on 9 May, and Northern troops entered on the following day. However, heavy Union casualties during the Peninsula Campaign filled the Norfolk Naval Hospital with wounded soldiers and prevented the U.S. War Department from returning that facility to the Navy until September 1862. Thus Ben Morgan remained busy at Hampton Roads seeing to Navy needs. Staff moves ashore in Richmond Meanwhile, the buildup of the fleet to tighten the Union blockade of the South increased the Navy‚Äôs need for arms and ammunition in Hampton Roads, and the task of storing ordnance supplies was added to Ben Morgans duties. In June 1862, when the Navy occupied a vacant building near Fort Norfolk, Ben Morgans embarked medical team ‚Äî headed by Assistant Surgeon James H. Macomber ‚Äî went ashore to turn that structure into a temporary naval hospital. This freed the ship to devote herself exclusively to her logistical missions. From that time on, she lay anchored in Hampton Roads ‚Äî some distance from other ships lying there ‚Äî while laden with explosives and moored at Norfolk when carrying a less dangerous cargo. Final operations Early in the spring of 1863, the ship was surveyed and condemned; but the need for her services had proved so great that she continued to function in Hampton Roads until autumn when she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs and recaulking. She was scheduled to perform similar duties at New Berne, North Carolina, upon the completion of the yard work; but smallpox broke out among her crew and the ship remained in quarantine until after another vessel had taken her place in the North Carolina Sounds. As a result, when she was ready to resume her labors, Ben Morgan returned to Hampton Roads and served in the Norfolk vicinity until she returned to New York City after the collapse of the Confederacy. She was sold there to a Mr. Hammill on November 30, 1865.

The film is about a teenager coping with life in the ghetto, sustained by her fierce desire to become successful and not a product of her environment.  Plot  Chantel Mitchell (Ariyan A. Johnson) is an African-American, 17-year-old high school junior who lives in Brooklyn, New York. Chantel is very smart, although her sharp tongue, abundant ego, and occasional naivete undermine her efforts. Her ultimate dream is to leave her poor neighborhood, go to college, and eventually become a doctor. Throughout the movie, Chantel breaks the fourth wall and states that she wants to be seen as more than just another teenage black girl on the subway. The \\"I.R.T.\\" in the film's title refers to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway system (I.R.T. stands for \\"Interborough Rapid Transit Company\\"). She lives with her struggling working class parents and her two younger brothers. With her mother working during the day and her father working the night shift and hence sleeping all day, Chantel is given the responsibility of taking care of her brothers in addition to going to school full-time and working a part-time job at a local grocery store. However, she earns mostly As and Bs in school, and is fully determined to receive an education beyond her primary one. Much to the chagrin of her teachers, she wants to graduate early in order to get into college as soon as possible. Her dream is tested with her constant clashes with her school's administration, and her recent romantic involvement with her seemingly rich boyfriend Tyrone (Kevin Thigpen). She becomes pregnant and undermines herself with false confidence and lack of real worldly knowledge.  Cast *Ariyan A.

It finds its foundation in Kenneth Waltz's Theory of International Politics, in which Waltz argues that the anarchical structure of the international system encourages states to maintain moderate and reserved policies to attain security.Waltz 1979. In contrast, offensive realism assumes that states seek to maximize their power and influence to achieve security through domination and hegemony.Mearsheimer 2001. Defensive neorealism asserts that aggressive expansion as promoted by offensive neorealists upsets the tendency of states to conform to the balance of power theory, thereby decreasing the primary objective of the state, which they argue is ensuring its security.Layne 2003. While defensive realism does not deny the reality of interstate conflict, nor that incentives for state expansion do exist, it contends that these incentives are sporadic rather than endemic. Defensive neorealism points towards \\"structural modifiers\\" such as the security dilemma and geography, and elite beliefs and perceptions to explain the outbreak of conflict.Taliaferro 2000/01. Theoretical origins Defensive neorealism is a structural theory that is part of structural realism, also known as neorealism, which is a subset of the realist school of thought in International Relations theory. Neorealism therefore works from realism's five base theoretical assumptions as outlined by offensive neorealist scholar John J. Mearsheimer in \\"The False Promise of International Institutions\\". These assumptions are:Mearsheimer 1994-1995. # The international system is anarchic. # States inherently possess some offensive military capability, which gives them the ability to hurt and possibly destroy each other. # States can never be certain about the intentions of other states. # The basic motive driving states is survival. # States think strategically about how to survive in the international system. These five assumptions drive neorealism's belief that state survival is attained through \\"self-help\\".Mearsheimer 2006 However, neorealism departs from classical realism's other main assumption that it is the flaws and complexities of human nature that drive the international system.Morgenthau 1948.Machiavelli 2010. Instead, neorealists assert that the anarchy inherent to the structure of the international system is the driving force of international politics. It is on these key neorealist assumptions that defensive and offensive neorealists base their competing understandings of state behavioural patterns. Main tenets =Defensive neorealism= As Kenneth Waltz asserted in his seminal defensive neorealist text Theory of International Politics, defensive neorealists argue that the anarchic nature of the international system encourages states to undertake defensive and moderate policies. They argue that states are not intrinsically aggressive and that \\"the first concern of states is not to maximize power but to maintain their position in the system\\".Waltz 1979, p. 126. This is the crucial point of departure from offensive neorealism, which instead argues that anarchy encourages states to increase state power vigorously, as \\"the world is condemned to perpetual great power competition\\". Defensive neorealists identify a number of problems regarding offensive neorealism's support of aggressive expansion of power. Building on Waltz's balance of power theory and the assumption that \\"balancing is more common than bandwagoning\\", defensive neorealists assert that states which strive to attain hegemony in the international system will be counterbalanced by other states seeking to maintain the status quo. While offensive realists believe states inherently desire either global hegemony or local hegemony, defensive neorealists argue that states are socialised and aware of historical precedent, which defensive neorealists assert, generally displays state aggression and expansion to fulfil the aim of hegemony as attracting resistance from other states. Aggression is therefore argued to be self- defeating in achieving the aim of security, which defensive neorealists posit to be the state's primary objective. Indeed, Jack Snyder asserts, \\"international anarchy punishes aggression; it does not reward it\\".Snyder 1991, p. 11. This assumption in turn, informs defensive neorealism's assertion that the benefits of conquest rarely outweigh its negatives. Defensive neorealists state that the problems conquest faces are diverse, existing both during the opening phases of expansion and during occupation. They contend that the subjugation of a state's population is risky and difficult, especially in the face of the modern concept of nationalism, which can provide an effective narrative of resistance if the state is conquered. This increases the already expensive process of occupation, especially in societies that rely on freedom of movement and transportation for economic prosperity because these are vulnerable to sabotage and embargo. In addition, newly acquired infrastructure must be protected and rebuilt when destroyed, the defence of new borders must be consolidated, and the possible resistance of local workers to contributing skilled labour to the new authorities, all combine to place heavy strain on the economic and production capabilities of the conquering state. In contrast to offensive neorealists, defensive neorealists assert that these strains outweigh the economic benefits states can attain from conquered territory, resources and infrastructure. =Individual security and state security= Defensive neorealists also point to the disconnect between individual security and state security, which they believe offensive neorealists conflate. Defensive neorealists assert that \\"states are not as vulnerable as men are in a state of nature\\"Jervis 1978, p. 172. and their destruction is a difficult and protracted task. They contend that states, especially major powers, can afford to wait for definitive evidence of attack rather than undertaking pre-emptive strikes or reacting inappropriately to inadvertent threats. This aspect is crucial. It allows the possibility of overcoming, or at least reducing, the impact of one of the prominent theories of neorealism: the security dilemma or spiral model. Coined by John H. Herz in his 1951 work Political Realism and Political Idealism, defensive neorealists believe the security dilemma, as expanded by Robert Jervis in \\"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma\\" in 1978, is defined by the assumption that the offense-defense balance tends to favour defensive capability over offensive capability.Herz 1951. The outbreak of World War I and its subsequent hostilities is commonly used as an example in which states erroneously believed offensive capabilities to be superior to those of defense. Defensive neorealists argue that just as in World War I, offensive dominance tends to be unsupported by political reality and military reality and is in fact, only perceived.Van Evera 1998. A key component of this view is that geography, offensive neorealists such as John Mearsheimer contend, usually inhibits the projection of power due to the natural barriers rivers, mountains, deserts, oceans, jungles, etc., present. These operational and logistical problems only increase as the area(s) of operations move further away from the aggressor. In addition, defensive neorealists assert that the second-strike capability afforded by either a state's nuclear arsenal or that of its allies, inhibits the ability of the aggressor state to conquer another. This is used as evidence that defensive capabilities ultimately trump offensive ones, and that they encourages states to employ defensive and restrained policies. Indeed, Robert Jervis states that when the security dilemma is tipped in defense's favour \\"international anarchy [is] relatively unimportant\\" as \\"status-quo states can make themselves more secure without gravely endangering others\\".Jervis 1978, p. 187. This does not mean however, that defensive neorealists deny that opportunities for state expansion exist, nor that states should not exploit these opportunities as they are presented. As Stephen Van Evera argues in Causes of War: Power and the Roots of Conflict, sometimes states that wish to maintain the status quo must become the aggressor in order to prevent later aggression against themselves or their allies.Van Evera 1999. This is especially relevant for states that lack protective geographical barriers, even if they employ policies that promote the status quo. Here, balancing behaviour is undertaken more abruptly, it is more likely to intimidate other states and offensive policies are more likely to be implemented. Defensive neorealists however, contend that a favourable offensive balance is the exception rather than the rule, and that unnecessary aggression and expansion is self-defeating and counterproductive. =Elite perceptions and beliefs= Defensive neorealists claim that elite perceptions and beliefs are key to the outbreak of conflict between states. Along with geography and the security dilemma, defensive neorealists believe these perceptions are a structural modifier, an anomaly that upsets the balance of power, rather than evidence of the fundamental offensive neorealist assumption that the anarchical structure of the international system encourages security through the increase of relative state power. These perceptions manifest in a number of ways and are often employed in an irregular way, which intimidates other states. They can lead elites to inflate threats in order to mobilise resources and promote expansion, or conversely, inhibit elites from recognising or rectifying their declining power in the international system due to domestic concerns being prioritised over international concerns.Schweller 2006. Elite perceptions, especially when dominated by groups such as the military, which have joined with other groups espousing an expansionist ideology, can lead to a state's overexpansion. This occurs because the multiple groups dominate a very centralised system and each enacts its often differing aims. Effective restriction and balancing of expansion is therefore difficult or ignored. Despite vast territorial gains, they are not effectively consolidated, the population is not subjugated or enfolded into the state narrative, resources are not effectively exploited, and the rapid expansion becomes unsustainable. If the elites realise their mistake, it is incredibly difficult to rectify their grand strategy due to the narrative sold both to its own members and to the general public, effectively condemning the state to defeat.Kupchan 1994. This is exemplified by the Japanese Empire's rapid expansion starting in the 1930s and its subsequent collapse. Criticism Despite defensive realism's significant contribution to international relations theory and its number of prominent proponents, such as Kenneth Waltz, Stephen Van Evera, and Charles L. Glaser, it has been criticised both by offensive realists and other scholars. A major point of contention is the difficulty states face in accurately assessing the offense- defense balance. This is because of war's uncertainty and because at a more basic level, the military equipment used to wage war is inherently ambiguous. Equipment is neither solidly defensive nor offensive in nature and its ambiguity only increases as the equipment's sophistication and capability develops. This is further compounded when state policies, strategy and relations are considered. Depending on the political context and history between the state(s) assessing and the state(s) assessed, some pieces of military equipment could reasonably be determined to be for offensive or defensive use, regardless of the reality. Defensive realism's critics assert that this entrenched ambiguity, even in the face of the realist assumption that states think rationally and strategically about how to survive, is too great a risk for states to chance. They assert that states will naturally assume the worst-case scenario to ensure their own security in the \\"self-help\\" environment, which realists assume dominates the anarchic international system. This view is summarised concisely by Stephen Walt: \\"If states cannot measure the offense-defense balance or distinguish between offensive and defensive capabilities, then security-seeking states cannot escape the security dilemma and cannot signal their peaceful intention in a convincing manner.\\"Walt 2002. Assuming the proposed dearth of clear signalling between states is as prevalent as defensive realism's critics would suggest, this clearly then, contests defensive realism's validity. Building on the offense- defense ambiguity, it has also been suggested that it is impossible to accurately gauge when a state has attained a satisfactory level of relative power. This can combine with unfavourable structural modifiers such as geography to contradict the idea that states can afford to wait for definitive signs of attack. One of defensive neorealism's main criticisms asserts that it is unable to theorise and make assumptions about the policies of specific states as offensive neorealism can.Toft 2005, p. 403.

In the , Seventeen Mile Rocks had a population of 2,720 people.  Geography  Seventeen Mile Rocks is located south-west of the Brisbane CBD on the Brisbane River. It is bounded to the north-east by the Brisbane River and to the west by Jindalee Creek. The north-west of the suburb is an industrial area () while the north-east is the Rocks Riverside Park (). The remainder of the suburb is residential apart from another industrial area in the south-west of the locality ().  History  alt= Man-made sandstone cairn at Seventeen Mile Rocks in the Brisbane River, circa 1940s The suburb Seventeen Mile Rocks is named after a collection of rocks of the same name () that marked a distance of from the mouth of the Brisbane River, as noted by John Oxley on 3 December 1823. They ran diagonally across the river from Counihan Road (see map). These rocks were partially removed in the 1860s to make the river more navigable. However, some of the rocks survived and were marked with beacons to warn shipping. Between 1960 and 1966 all of the remaining rocks were removed to widen the river and allow access for marine vessels to further reaches of the river. Seventeen Mile Rocks State School opened circa 1874. It closed on 1966. It was Goggs Road opposite the junction with Seventeen Miles Rocks Road () which is now within the suburb of Jindalee. Jindalee Home shopping centre is now on that site. A portion of Seventeen Mile Rocks comes from the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Wolston Estate is the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction. The suburb was previously an industrial one; but in recent years new housing estates have been developed greatly increasing the residential population. The major estate is Edenbrooke, while the newest is Verandah. The major road through the suburb is Seventeen Mile Rocks Road which links the suburb to Jindalee and the Western Freeway at the western end and Oxley at the eastern end The Western drive-in movie theatre was on the south- eastern corner of Seventeen Mile Rocks Road and Fremont Street (). It extended almost through to Argyle and Molesworth Streets (apart from a row of houses facing each of those streets). It operated from 10 November 1966 until 22 June 1988. It initially opened with a capacity of 500 cars but expanded that to 642 by 1971. It was replaced in the late 1980s by a housing estate. Several of the new estates also feature walking tracks and lakes. In the , Seventeen Miles Rocks had a population of 2,899 people. In the , Seventeen Mile Rocks had a population of 2,720 people.  Facilities  Rocks Riverside Park is located in Seventeen Mile Rocks. It is one of Brisbane's largest riverside parks. It features walking and cycling tracks, a basketball court, a flying fox, a climbing web as well as picnic facilities and playing fields. Seventeen Mile Rocks includes three Christian churches; the iSee Church, the 17 Mile Church and the Riverlife Baptist Church (previously the Kenmore Baptist Church on Kenmore Road, Kenmore).  Education  There are no schools in Seventeen Miles Rocks. The nearest primary schools are Darra State School in neighbouring Darra to the south, Corinda State School in Corinda to the east and Jindalee State School in Jindalee to the north-west.

Their prominence in the Century City skyline has been reduced in recent years with the addition of new skyscrapers that partially block their view. Nevertheless, the Century Plaza Towers remain the tallest buildings in Century City and the tallest skyscrapers in Southern California outside of downtown Los Angeles. The towers sit atop one of the world's largest underground parking garages with a capacity of roughly 5,000 cars. The Los Angeles Times reported that as of February 2020, the signature twin office skyscrapers are fully occupied for the first time. In popular culture In television, the towers were the headquarters of the fictional private detective Remington Steele, the main character of the eponymous NBC series, which ran from 1982 to 1987. Nearly every episode included an exterior establishing shot of the towers. The towers have also served as the backdrop for several television commercials, including adverts for Samsung, Buick, Volvo, and Kia Motors. In film, the towers were featured in 1988's Die Hard (shown at the end credits), 1990's Death Warrant, and 2011's The Green Hornet'‚Äô. They were also used as opening and establishing shots for the CBS series Family Law starring Oscar-nominated actress Kathleen Quinlan. The buildings were also used in Melrose Place as the office of Lexi Sterling's business, Sterling Advertising. They were also seen in Burke's Law. The buildings were used for the album cover of Yes‚Äôs 1977 album Going for the One. In 1979, Olivia Newton-John filmed the music video for the title track of her album Totally Hot here. In 1981 the buildings were used in a bumper of the silver ball for Nickelodeon. The buildings were shown under construction in a 1974 episode of Barnaby Jones entitled \\"Dark Legacy\\". In the 1990 TV movie, \\"The Great Los Angeles Earthquake\\" during 8.0 and 7.2 magnitude earthquakes both buildings sway violently, afterwards both buildings remain standing but are severely damaged.

Dungu's terrain is wooded savannah, and its climate is tropical. It is the principal town in Dungu Territory. It has a hospital, nursing school, high school, Internet cafe, and a cathedral‚Äîas it is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Doruma‚ÄìDungu. The town is divided into four main neighbourhoods: Uye (south), Mussa (south center), Ngilima (center) and Bamokandi (north). Dungu is served by Dungu-Uye Airport, which is just southeast of the town. Dungu Airport is northeast of Dungu. In 2004 its population was estimated at over 23,000. 2004 Urban Population map of the Democratic Republic of Congo The major tribe is the Azande, and the national language used locally is Lingala. Some people speak a dialect of Lingala called Bangala, which contains many words from Zande, Swahili, and other languages. Colonial History In 1942, the Belgian territorial administrator Schollaert was given the task of building a bridge across the Dungu River. Instead of building a two-lane bridge as ordered, he built a one-lane bridge. With the remaining bricks he built a medieval style castle with 40 rooms between the Dungu and Kibali rivers.

In September 2005 Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) entered Dungu Territory from Sudan and set up in Garamba National Park. Since October 2008, following attacks by the LRA, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res has had a team in Dungu to help with the wounded and the health needs of the displaced, soon followed by other international relief NGOs such as Solidarit√©s, Oxfam Quebec, Cesvi, Coopi, Danish Refugee Council and Medair.

Dungu: situation humanitaire d√©plorable pour plus de 100,000 d√©plac√©s internes Humanitarian Response to the LRA Crisis Following torrential rains in the Oriental Province in northern D.R. Congo in November 2012, which destroyed thousands of houses in Dungu, the MONUSCO Engineering Unit built an alternative road across the jungle to connect the town to the airfield, and thus facilitate humanitarian access to the area. The LRA crisis has affected the whole of Haut-Uele District, and Dungu is used as the main base of operations for most, if not all, international and local humanitarian organizations, including MONUC and the UN agencies. Although Medair, Terre Sans Fronti√®res, MSF Suisse and Solidarit√©s were present prior to the beginning of the LRA crisis in mid-September 2008, many non-governmental organizations set up bases and projects in various fields in January 2009. These NGOs are from Switzerland (Medair), Denmark (DRC ‚Äì Danish Refugee Council), Italy (Cooperazione Internazionale or COOPI and Cesvi), Canada (Oxfam Quebec, Terre Sans Fronti√®res), the United States (Mercy Corps) and the United Kingdom (Oxfam Great Britain); the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an international sovereign organisation, is also present. Local and national NGOs, such as Caritas DRC (known locally as Caritas D√©veloppement Congo) ADSSE and CDJP, are also active in Dungu. The United Nations has a good presence in Dungu, with most of the agencies and MONUC firmly established in the town since March 2009. Two peacekeeping battalions (Moroccan and Indonesian) ensure security as well as road maintenance, while agencies such as OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF, FAO, WFP and UNDP (through the Pooled Fund program) act as donors and coordinators of the humanitarian response. A detachment of Bangladesh Air Contingent (BANAIR) also operates under MONUSCO with 3 helicopters in Dungu.

He won a bronze medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City before winning a silver medal at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. He is the only Ugandan athlete to have won more than one Olympic medal. He also won a silver medal at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Early life Rwabwogo was born in Tororo, a town in the Eastern Region of Uganda. He took up boxing and joined the Kilembe Mines Boxing Center in the west of the country. Career =1968 Olympics= Rwabwogo had claimed the African flyweight title in the 1960s and was selected as part of the Ugandan boxing team for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. He was drawn against South Korean Seo Sang-yeong in his debut fight in the Olympics, winning a unanimous 5‚Äì0 decision. Further decision victories over American David Vasquez and Hungarian Tibor Badari followed, winning both 3‚Äì2, advanced Rwabwogo to the semi-final. Rwabwogo met Polish fighter Artur Olech who had won the silver medal in the event four years earlier at the 1964 Summer Olympics. The experienced Olech proved too strong for Rwabwogo, winning the fight in a 4‚Äì1 decision. Despite his defeat, Rwabwogo won the bronze medal in the event. He became the second athlete to win an Olympic medal in the nation's history, his teammate Eridadi Mukwanga had also guaranteed himself a medal two days earlier in the bantamweight division. Rwabwogo was however the first to receive his medal as Mukwanga had advanced in his weight class. Mukwanga went on to win the silver medal after losing the final. =1972 Olympics= At the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, Rwabwogo won the silver medal after losing to Englishman Dave Needham. He was chosen to represent Uganda again at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, winning his first round bout over Uruguayan Jorge Acu√±a by a 5‚Äì0 decision. He recorded his first TKO victory in an Olympic event in the second round, stopping British fighter Maurice O'Sullivan. He recorded a decision victory over Thailand's Chawalit On-Chim before recording a second TKO victory of the tournament by stopping Irishman Neil McLaughlin in the quarter-final. Having lost in the semi-finals four years earlier, Rwabwogo went one better in the 1972 games by defeating Cuban fighter Douglas Rodriguez in a 3‚Äì2 decision victory to reach the flyweight final. Rwabwogo met Bulgarian Georgi Kostadinov in the gold medal match on 10 September. Kostadinov was the stronger in the first two rounds but, in the third, Rwabwogo mounted a \\"heavy counter-offensive\\" in an attempt to recover. However, Kostadinov held out to win the gold, with Rwabwogo claiming silver. Rwabwogo's trainer would later claim that an injured right hand had impeded his fight and denied him victory. By winning silver, Rwabwogo became the only Ugandan athlete to win more than one Olympic medal in the nation's history. He is also one of only three fighters to have won more than one medal at flyweight in Olympic history, alongside Artur Olech of Poland and Bulat Zhumadilov of Kazakhstan. His silver medal victory briefly tied him with Mukwanga for Uganda's highest placed finish at an Olympic event until hurdler John Akii-Bua claimed the nation's first ever gold medal days later. Later life Rwabwogo was offered the chance to turn professional in the United States following the 1972 games but was persuaded to remain in Uganda by officials from that nation. After retiring from fighting, he took up other roles within boxing, coaching other fighters and becoming a referee. He remained in Kilembe, taking up a role as a sports officer at Kilembe Mines, the same club he had boxed at as a teenager. In 1981, Rwabwogo was a campaigner for Crispus Kiyonga and became a member of the National Resistance Movement. He ended his life working as a peasant farmer in relative poverty. He died while tending his garden in the village of Rugongo in the Kabarole District at the age of 59 in 2008, leaving behind 12 children. The poverty stricken nature of Rwabwogo's death caused shock in Uganda. A fundraising drive raised sh1.1m and included the donation of 50 metal sheets and two acres of land to construct a home for Rwabwogo's family.

Durosoir studied the violin with Joseph Joachim and Hugo Heermann in Germany before his first tour as a young virtuoso in 1899. In addition to giving the first performances of French music in Austria-Hungary and Germany (Saint-Sa√´ns, Faur√©, Lalo, Widor, Bruneau), he also gave the French premiere of the Strauss violin concerto in 1901. His career as a violinist was cut short by World War I. Durosoir served in the Fifth Division, which took part in some of the bloodiest battles of the war (Douaumont, the Chemin des Dames, and Eparges). At the encouragement of General Mangin, Durosoir formed a string quartet with his fellow soldiers Henri Lemoine (second violin), Andr√© Caplet (viola), and Maurice Mar√©chal (cello). After his demobilization in February, 1919, he began to compose at his home in southwest France. For the next thirty years he composed a host of works, including three string quartets, (1920, 1922 and 1933‚Äì34) a large piano sonata (Le Lys, 1921), a piano quintet (1925), an orchestral suite (Fun√©railles, 1930), and about twenty-five works of chamber music for various instrumental combinations. Isolated from Parisian musical trends, Durosoir forged a very personal style in the Romantic tradition, but with unusual features such as polyrhythms. In 1922 Andr√© Caplet wrote, \\"I will talk with enthusiasm to all my friends about your quartet, which I find a thousand times more interesting than anything with which the noisy group of newcomers overwhelms us.\\" From 1950 onwards illness prevented him from continuing to compose and he died in December 1955. Thanks to his son Luc Durosoir and Luc's wife Georgie, a renowned musicology professor at the Sorbonne, Durosoir's works have been published and the MEGEP chamber music competition was founded to encourage the revival of the genre. A book of Durosoir's letters has been published to much acclaim in France, and interest in the music is increasing amongst musicologists, performers and pedagogues. Biography =The Concert Violinist= At the age of 14, Lucien Durosoir enrolled in Conservatoire Sup√©rieur de Paris, where he studied with Henri Berthelier; however, after several months he was expelled for insolence toward its director, Ambroise Thomas. Durosoir continued his violin studies privately with Berthelier while at the same time learning composition with Charles Tournemire. In 1898, Edouard Colonne engaged him as first chair violinist for his Orchestra of the Concerts Colonne. He went to Germany, where he perfected his technique and interpretive skill under the violinists Joseph Joachim and Hugo Heermann. Starting in 1900, he undertook concert tours extending to central Europe, Russia, Germany, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There he played, for the first time, the violin repertory of contemporary French composers such as Saint-Sa√´ns, Lalo, Widor and Bruneau, and in Vienna in 1910, he premiered the Sonata in A Major for Violin and Piano by Gabriel Faur√©. While on tour in France he premiered modern German and Danish masterpieces: *Niels Gade's Violin Concerto in D Minor, Op. 56 at the Salle Pleyel in 1899 *Richard Strauss's Violin Concerto in D Minor, Op.8 His performances were all met with favorable reviews: *\\"captivates the public by the loftiness and spirit of his playing\\" (Neue Freie Press, 11 January 1910) *\\"all of these pieces were performed with the same nobility and beauty of execution\\"' (Wiener Mittags-Zeitung, 28 January 1910) *\\"He displayed, in the concerto of Max Bruch, the rarest qualities of sonority and musicality, and in the Dvo≈ô√°k concerto an astonishing style and virtuosity... Monsieur Lucien Durosoir, in this lovely performance, ranks among the foremost virtuosos of his time.\\" (Le Figaro, 19 May 1904) [reference: Les Archives biographiques contemporaines (Paris, sd. [vers 1911]), p. 219-220. Posters and concert programs from the Durosoir family archives, B√©lus, France] =The soldier= November 1903 concert program at the Berlin Sing-Akademie. When World War I broke out, Durosoir was 36. After a year fighting in the trenches, he became a stretcher- bearer and awaited nightfall before venturing out to collect the wounded. Durosoir came to the attention of General Mangin, a great music lover, who recruited him, along with the composer Andr√© Caplet and the young cellist Maurice Mar√©chal, to form a chamber music ensemble. The trio played for funeral services, for guests (such as visiting English officers and, more rarely, civilians) in the general's quarters, and in the barracks for the soldiers‚Äô entertainment. Their concerts featured all kinds of arrangements of orchestral works for piano and solo instruments. During this time the duties of Durosoir and Caplet also included caring for the carrier pigeons. The three spent these terrible years together, and their friendship was sealed in the trenches as well as in their music-making. The inspiration to compose increasingly seized Durosoir's imagination. He acquired scores and studied the style of Brahms, Beethoven, Haydn, and others. In 1915 Emma Debussy sent him Claude Debussy's √âtudes. Durosoir and Caplet were examining these when six bombs fell around their building. Thinking ahead to the end of the war, Durosoir wrote on 12 September 1916, \\"I begin to compose so as to become accustomed to managing the freer forms, and my efforts, I am convinced, will be fruitful.\\" During the periods of repose from his duties in the trenches, he continued his study of counterpoint and fugue with exercises \\"corrected\\" by Andr√© Caplet. [reference: Deux musiciens dans la Grande Guerre (Paris, Tallandier-Radio France, 2005; Mangin (G√©n√©ral), Lettres de guerre, 1914-1918 (Paris, Fayard, 1950)] =The composer= Durosoir returned to civilian life in February 1919. In 1921, the Boston Symphony Orchestra offered him the position of first chair violin. He accepted, and was on the point of leaving when an accident prevented his departure, and he had to give up his career as a violinist. From then until his death, he lived in retirement far from Paris and its artistic circles. On the basis of his academic work, reinforced by his personal study of scores and compositional exercises, he began composing, and crafted an individual and bold musical style independent from the mainstream. His works display neither perceptible influences nor overtly stated references. Nearly all of his works are headed by a quotation of contemporary poetry, or by a prose quotation of a philosophical nature. Andr√© Caplet wrote to him in 1922: \\"I will speak with enthusiasm to all my associates of your quartet, which find many times more interesting than all the products with which the group of flashy newcomers overwhelm us.\\" Lucien Durosoir composed around forty unpublished works, including pieces for varied ensembles, symphonic works and chamber music: string quartets, sonatas, trios, short piano works, numerous pieces for piano and solo instruments. After 1950, illness prevented him from composing, and he died in December 1955. =The music= As a result of his intentional isolation from the Parisian musical trends of the time, Durosoir's compositions have a unique character. While not outwardly programmatic, they are often preceded by some verses of poetry which serve as a threshold into his highly personal world of expression. His style is a lean and spare one that is marked by solid construction, sudden contrasts and avoidance of gratuitous ornament. Tonal with a harmonic palette enriched by non-chord tones and altered scales, the music shows a strong need for resolution that occasionally veers off toward regions of atonality. Similarly, the constraints imposed by regular meter are cast off by means of frequent metric changes and tempo alterations. Durosoir shows great imagination in the area of musical texture and the use of extended performance techniques (con sordino, sul ponticello, col legno, ricochet, harmonics), and consequently expressive indications are encountered in each melodic line. In short, the music of Lucien Durosoir avoids categorization with many of the \\"ism\\" labels (i.e.: impressionism, neoclassicism) that are commonly applied to music of the early twentieth century.

N. Sinha's statue at Satyendra Narayan Sinha Park,Patna The Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, declared a state of emergency on 25 June 1975 due to internal political disturbances. Accordingly, all fundamental rights enjoyed in the Indian Constitution were suspended. Political dissidents, newspaper reporters, opposition leaders who opposed emergency were jailed. Chhote Saheb, along with other prominent leaders, opposed this blatant misuse of state machinery. In 1977, during the emergency in India, he was made president of Bihar Janata Party and Chairman of State Election Committee. He worked together with premier colleagues of Janata Party like Morarji Desai, Chandra Shekhar Singh, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, Charan Singh, Jagjivan Ram, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Madhu Limaye, H. D. Deve Gowda, Inder Kumar Gujral, Raj Narain, George Fernandes and Karpuri Thakur and the movement was a grand success in Bihar. He motivated the youth and students to take an active role in politics, and ensured their representation in political affairs. During, the Bihar legislative assembly election 1977,a massive crowd of youth leaders and activists used to converge at his residence. Satyendra Narayan Sinha's political encouragement to the youths led to the emergence of then youth leaders of Janata Party like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Nitish Kumar, Ram Vilas Paswan, Subodh Kant Sahay, Kripanath Pathak, Ram Jatan Sinha, Jagdish Sharma, Thakur Muneshwar Nath Singh, Raghupati Singh and Narendra Singh. After the emergency was lifted on 21 March 1977, fresh general elections were held in India. The Congress Party, led by Indira Gandhi suffered a defeat at the hands of the Janata Party coalition of several small parties created in 1977 and the alliance came to power, headed by Morarji Desai, who became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. In Bihar, the Janata Party won all the fifty-four Lok Sabha seats in 1977 general elections under the mentorship of Jayaprakash Narayan and rose to power in Bihar assembly too. He struck by the Janata Party and preferred to be in opposition although he would have been considered a prize catch by the Congress party. = Return to Congress = He quit the party following differences with the then party president Chandra Shekhar Singh and returned to the Congress fold in 1984. The then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi came down to Patna to formally admit him back to the Congress party. = Chief Ministership = As the Chief Minister of Bihar, Chhote Saheb also held the portfolio of Education for the fourth term in his later years 1989‚Äì1990. In the same year, he conceived, the proposal to set up a NTPC's super thermal power project at Nabinagar in Bihar's Aurangabad district to then Prime Minister of India and Congress leader Rajiv Gandhi; but the project went into limbo as the following state governments failed to follow it. In 2007, Manmohan Singh's government finally put a stamp of approval on it. He is also credited for the establishment of the Indira Gandhi Planetarium cum Science Centre in Patna. Under his regime, Panchayati Raj system of governance was introduced in Bihar. In his autobiography Meri Yaadein, Meri Bhoolein, released by the then Bihar Governor Buta Singh in the presence of Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee (also former President of India), He accused his state colleagues of \\"fanning\\" the 1989 Bhagalpur violence to malign him, specifically mentioning his predecessor and former chief minister Bhagwat Jha Azad and the former speaker Shivchandra Jha. He didn't agree with the over- ruling of his order to transfer the then superintendent of police K S Dwivedi who had failed miserably to discharge his duties. The decision was not only an encroachment of the Constitutional right of the state government but also a step detrimental to ongoing efforts to ease tensions. When he stepped down from the post of Chief Minister of Bihar, Jagannath Mishra succeeded him. He recalled when he met Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi later on, he informed him about the \\"role of some Congress leaders\\" in the riots. The Prime Minister expressed surprise and said \\"so, the riots were motivated!\\" = Parliament of India = S. N.

N. Sinha's wife Kishori Sinha is a former Member of Parliament from Vaishali, and his daughter-in-law Shyama Singh is a former Member of Parliament from Aurangabad. His son, Nikhil Kumar, a former IPS official, has served as the Governor of the Indian state of Nagaland and also as the Governor of Kerala. S. N. Sinha wrote his autobiography Meri Yadein: Meri Bhoolein, which incorporates the experiences and perceptions of a leader of his eminence and stature. His official residence in Delhi, 28 Akbar Road, had consistently won awards for being one of the best kept bungalows in the national capital. Its grand garden continually won awards at all Delhi's flower shows and was one of capital's landmark gardens. Criticism Sinha is criticised for his lackadaisical approach towards handling of 1989 Bhagalpur violence. N.N Singh committee report tabled in Bihar legislative assembly made him responsible of taking no action and showing complete inactivation during one of the biggest human right violation which led to displacement of over 50000 muslims.The riots is said to have claimed the life of thousands of muslims, mostly poor weavers while the police and Congress administration under Sinha took no action.  Commemoration  The inaugural lecture of the annual Satyendra Narayan Sinha Memorial Lecture Series was delivered by Vice-President of India Shri Hamid Ansari in Patna. In 2014, the then Bihar CM announced to rename Magadh University of which Late Sinha was the founder as Satyendra Narayan Sinha Magadh University. The Children's Park in the capital Patna has now been rechristened as Satyendra Narayan Sinha Park and the foundation for installing a life-size statue of former Bihar CM was laid by Chief Minister Shri Nitish Kumar at a state function in 2015.

The 2540 was designed by IBM's Data Processing Division in Rochester, Minnesota, and was introduced in 1965. The 2540 could read punched- cards at 1000 cards per minute (CPM) and punch at 300 CPM. The 2540 was based on the design of the older, slightly slower, 1402. Description IBM 2540 card read/punch in an IBM System/370 Model 145 installation The 2540 attached to a System/360 multiplexer or selector channel through an IBM 2821 Control Unit. A standard 2540 processed standard IBM 80 column punched cards. The card reader (2540R) and card punch (2540P) devices were separately addressable and functioned independently. The 2540 normally read and punched EBCDIC data, called data-mode 1. =Card reader= On the right side of the device was the reader, consisting of an input hopper holding approximately 3100 cards, and three output stackers (right to left ‚Äì R1, R2, and RP3) each holding approximately 1350 cards. Cards could be directed to an output stacker under program control. =Card punch= On the left side of the device was the punch, with an input hopper holding about 1350 cards, and three output stackers (left to right ‚Äì P1, P2, and RP3) each holding 1350. The center stacker (RP3) was shared between the reader and the punch, but was not intended to be used by both at the same time. Cards could be directed to an output stacker under program control. The card was read after punching to ensure that the data was punched correctly. Special features * Column binary ‚Äì this feature, data-mode 2, allowed all possible combinations of holes to be read or punched in a column. * Punch-feed-read ‚Äì this feature allowed input cards to be read by the punch unit and data simultaneously punched into the same card. This feature was not normally supported by spooling software. * 51-column Interchangeable Read Feed ‚Äì this feature allowed the 2540 to read 51-column \\"stub\\" cards in addition to standard 80-column cards. Operator setup was required to change card size, so the two sizes could not be intermixed. Installation of this feature reduced the capacities of stackers R1 and R2 to around 800 cards, and reduced read speed to 800 CPM.

It is a subspecies of the more common wedge-tailed eagle. Description Drawing by Louisa Anne Meredith of the head of a wedge-tailed eagle from Tasmanian friends and foes : feathered, furred and finned (1880) Aquila is a genus of large eagles that have long, rounded wings with deeply emarginated tips. They also have very strong legs and claws and ear-shaped nostrils. The subspecies A. a. fleayi is the largest of the wedge-tailed eagles. A. a. fleayi has a total body length between 100 and 110 cm with wingspans of 1.9‚Äì2.3 m, and weighs 3.5‚Äì5.5 kg. Females are larger (longer with a much larger beak) and are about 15% heavier than the males. They become sexually mature at 4‚Äì6 years of age. The largest wingspan recorded for an eagle was that of the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, a female killed in 1931 had a wingspan of , and another female was measured barely smaller at . Fledged juveniles are tawny brown with a dark blond nape and dark tail and flight feathers. The plumage darkens after many months until it is almost black. The bases of adults' primary feathers are pale silver, giving a 'window' appearance when viewed from below. Males are sooty brown with a reddish-golden nape. Outside the breeding season, Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles are usually quiet, although they produce a range of specific, rather gentle calls. They are usually found in pairs or as a family. During the breeding season, aerial displays are a common sight. Behaviour Wedge- tailed eagles are territorial, top-order predators with very large home ranges which are evenly dispersed in suitable habitats. =Breeding= Wedge-tailed eagles generally pair for life and remain together throughout the year. When courting and pair-bonding, they perform spectacular aerial displays. Courtship usually starts in late June, from this time onwards there is a gradual increase in aerial displays and nest repairing behaviour which peaks in late August. During August, the month prior to egg laying, the nest is liberally adorned and lined with greenery. This behaviour continues throughout breeding and may even be exhibited by single adults in territories. One or two eggs (usually one) is laid in late August or early September. Eggs appear whitish- grey with a few brown spots and are approximately in size. The female will incubate the eggs for 43‚Äì45 days and during this time is fed by the male. For the first few weeks after hatching the chick is fed by the female. By six to eight weeks of age the chick is capable of feeding itself and both parents bring food direct to the nest. Chicks take up to 90 days to fledge, after which will remain near the nest for several weeks. Juveniles are dependent on their parents for food for at least three months and may accompany parent birds until the next breeding season. Juvenile birds disperse widely after abandoning their parents. =Diet= Wedge-tailed eagles are carnivorous birds of prey that hunt over a wide range of habitats, including open heath, pasture and grassland, but may also scavenge on carrion when available. They feed mainly on rabbits, hares, birds (such as nativehen), wallabies and possums. Immature birds that lack hunting experience are particularly dependent on carrion as a source of food, although adults will also feed heavily on carrion during winter. In rural Tasmania, the diet of A. a. fleayi has been recorded to consist of rabbits, hares and cats (which comprise approximately 45% of items consumed); wallabies, possums, echidnas and wombats (approximately 30%); birds (approximately 10%); sheep and goats (approximately 7.5%); and reptiles (approximately 5%) (the remaining 2.5% of the diet is composed of other items). Hunting technique The wedge-tailed eagle captures most of its live prey by sallying. This typically involves a bird launching itself from a perch and then attacking prey on the ground or, less frequently, in flight. Hunting usually takes place during the day, and prey is usually eaten where it is captured, except during the breeding season when much of the food is taken back to the nest and is fed to the young. Eagles typically do not bring carrion back for the nestlings to consume. Although it is capable of killing prey much larger than their own body weight, most prey items taken are much smaller (approximately 50% or less of the eagle's mass). Wedge-tailed eagles cannot carry more than about one third of their own body weight. Distribution and habitat =Distribution= A. a. fleayi is distributed throughout Tasmania with only very few sightings on King Island and the smaller islands of Bass Strait. The species forages in all habitats from coastal dunes to mountain peaks. There is no known movement between Tasmania and mainland Australia of wedge-tailed eagles, however a single bird was sighted over Curtis Island circa 1985. Although the species is capable of foraging in forest, the density of the sub-canopy and ground vegetation will influence the availability of prey. Eagle density is therefore understood to be lower in the western and southwestern areas of Tasmania (less than half that in the east), where forests tend to be lower and scrubbier. Densities of the species are highest in areas providing mosaics of forest, farmland, grassland, wetlands and rivers. Estimated densities range from a minimum of one pair per in western and south-western Tasmania to one pair per in eastern and northern regions. =Nesting habitat= Wedge-tailed eagle nesting habitat is generally restricted to predominantly closed canopy old-growth native forest, almost exclusively in tracts of tall eucalypt forest greater than in area. However, nesting habitat can range from rainforest to isolated eucalypts in Acacia forest. Trees selected for nesting are among the largest in the locality, typically greater than in height, with few exceptions. Nest trees normally occur on leeward slopes sheltered from prevailing strong winds. The top of the tree is usually lower than ground level of the top of the adjacent ridge. The territory of a wedge-tailed eagle pair can contain up to three or five nests with one being favoured each year. Eagles will return to previous nesting sites, with some nests having been used continuously for at least 50 years. Nests are usually spaced about apart, but they can be separated by more than in areas where habitat is patchy or restricted. Conservation Reasons for the decline of the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle are lower breeding success from disturbances of nests, loss of habitat, a small breeding population, a decrease in the number of mature individuals, and an unnaturally high mortality rate due to persecution and other factors. The wedge-tailed eagle is wholly protected and killing one is illegal. About 20% of the eagles occur on designated reserves. An increase in breeding success on private property was pursued through the establishment of individual agreements and management plans. Throughout Tasmania, 60 landowners were contracted and 20 made agreements. The vast majority of known nests (over 80%) occur on State Forest and private property. This is partly due to the majority of suitable eagle habitat occurring on State Forest and private land but also due to the majority of nest site searches conducted as a result of forestry activities. A. a. fleayi will not nest in areas that have high human densities, the eagles are very timid while breeding and are likely to desert a nest if disturbed. =Population trends= Tasmania's wedge-tailed eagles have less genetic variation than their mainland relatives and have been isolated from the mainland for 8,000-10,000 years, since the last trans-Bassian land bridge. No historical measures of population size in Tasmania are known, but records suggest that the eagle is widespread but uncommon. It may have benefited from rabbit plagues, but poisoning has killed numbers of eagles, along with persecution. Breeding success has decreased to the point where, on average, 95 pairs are successful each year. About 69% of territories had active nests or all nests were known to have produced at least one egg and 53% were successful in raising a fledging. Annual mortality rates are about 50% for juveniles, 30% for other immature birds, and 5% for adults. Tasmania has only 220 nesting territories. However, not all territories are occupied by two adults and replacement times for adults ‚Äòlost‚Äô from territories seems excessive, suggesting a dearth of non-territorial floaters and an adult population less than 440.

When they arrived at the bakery, the owner proceeded to loudly harangue the prime minister over payroll tax (a state tax) in front of the media, causing Keating to leave in embarrassment.

Built in Oakland, California USS Pinkney (APH-2) was laid down as Alcoa Corsair (MC hull 176), 3 June 1941, by the Moore Dry Dock Co., Oakland, California; launched 4 December 1941; sponsored by Miss Ruth Grove; designated for U.S. Navy use and assigned the name Mercy. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, she was renamed Pinkney, 13 August 1942; acquired, by the U.S. Navy, 27 November 1942; and commissioned the same day, Comdr. A. L. Hutson in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre Operations  Following extensive fitting out and shakedown, USS Pinkney, an Evacuation Transport, departed San Diego, California, for Pearl Harbor and the South Pacific Ocean, 27 January 1943. In mid-February, she arrived at Espiritu Santo, whence she sailed to Purvis Bay to deliver reinforcements and replacements to the veteran units of the fight for Tulagi and Gavutu. Throughout the remaining battles for the Solomon Islands, among them Munda, Vella Lavella, Shortlands, Bougainville, and the numerous engagements in the \\"Slot\\", she brought men, food and ammunition forward and evacuated casualties from field hospitals to better facilities on New Caledonia and in New Zealand. She also transported American and New Zealand nurses to and between various southwest Pacific Ocean hospitals. By August 1944, island hopping had carried the Allies to and past the Marshall Islands and Mariana Islands. On 8 September, USS Pinkney departed Guadalcanal for the Palaus, the next group en route to the Philippine Islands. On the 15th, she delivered her passengers, men of the 1st Marine Regiment, to LVTs, which took them on to the beaches at Peleliu. She then took up position 6,000 yards off the assault area to expedite offloading of equipment and embarkation of casualties. On the 20th she sailed for Manus Island, whence she returned to the Palaus, again and again, to evacuate the wounded. = Invasion of the Philippines = In early October, she returned briefly to the Solomon Islands, then sailed for Hollandia, then the Philippines. Into November, she evacuated Leyte casualties to Hollandia, Mantis, and New Caledonia. In December, she prepared for the Luzon invasion. On 9 January 1945, she landed Army troops on the Lingayen beaches, and, once again, assumed responsibilities for the care and evacuation of casualties, this time to Leyte. In late February, while en route to the Solomons, she was diverted to Guam, thence to Iwo Jima. On the 28th, she returned to Guam, disembarked her patients and began preparations for her last campaign, Okinawa. = Okinawa operations = On 1‚Äì2 April, USS Pinkney participated in the feints against southern Okinawa, then shifted to the Hagushi assault area where she landed U.S. Marine combatant and hospital units on the 10th. Casualties, from ships and from ashore, were soon filling her hospital wards. Caring for patients and expediting transferral of others to the hospital ship USS Samaritan, she dodged enemy shells and kamikazes until the 28th. = Struck by a kamikaze = Viewing the damage, with electrical cables and hoses from support ships across the hole. On that day, at 1730, a low-flying kamikaze was spotted closing the ship. Seconds later USS Pinkney was rocked by an explosion and the after-end of the superstructure was walled by a sheet of flame. Ammunition began to explode. Water lines, electrical conduits, and steam pipes ruptured. The crew immediately formed rescue and damage control parties. Live ammunition was thrown overboard. All but 16 patients, killed in the initial explosion, were transferred to safety. Rescue tugs and landing craft moved in to assist in fire fighting, but the flames continued for another three hours, by which time USS Pinkney had lost 18 of her crew and had taken on a heavy list to port. A jagged hole, 30 feet in diameter, extended from the bridge deck to the bulkhead deck. All wards in the amidships hospital area were burned out. = Return to Stateside for repairs = Temporary repairs took 8 days. On 9 May, USS Pinkney got underway for Saipan en route to the United States. She arrived at San Francisco, California, 8 June, and underwent repairs.  Post-War operations  On 21 October, sailed for the Far East again, this time to carry replacements and occupation troops to Tokyo and Sasebo and return with veterans. By February 1946, she had completed another U.S. West Coast‚ÄîFar East run. Inactivation followed and on 9 September she was returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission and simultaneously transferred to the Army Transportation Service.  Conversion to U.S. Army use  Converted to an AP by the Puget Sound Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., and renamed USAT Pvt. Elden H. Johnson, 31 October 1947, she remained with the Army Transportation Service (ATS) until returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission, thence to the U.S. Navy, 1 March 1950.  Conversion to MSTS use  Designated AP‚Äì184, she joined the newly formed Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) and was assigned a civil service crew. As an MSTS vessel, she plied the same waters, Atlantic Ocean‚ÄìMediterranean‚ÄìAdriatic Sea, as she had under ATS until mid-1951, when runs to Caribbean ports were added to her schedule.  Final decommissioning  As USNS Pvt. Elden H. Johnson (T-AP-184) she continued to serve the U.S. Navy until 1957. On 27 December, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet and her name was struck from the Navy List. Into 1970, she remained with the NDRF, berthed with the Hudson River group.

For much of its run, the series served as a vehicle for Gilbert Shelton's work, particularly Wonder Wart-Hog. For a period the title billed itself \\"the International Journal of Humor and Cartoon Art\\" and showcased the work of European cartoonists from a variety of countries. As time passed, the sensibility of the anthology changed from underground to alternative comics. For many years, the series was edited by Rip Off Press co- publisher Kathe Todd.  Publication history  The first ten issues of Rip Off Comix were standard comic book size and were published approximately every 6 months. From issue #11 onward Rip Off Comix was published magazine-size. The title suffered a four-year hiatus between issue #12 (1983) and the next issue, #14 (1987); issue #13 was skipped in the numbering. From that point forward the title was published quarterly until it was cancelled in 1991. As a result of skipping issue #13, even though the series ended with issue #31, only 30 issues were published in total. Running for 14 years, Rip Off Comix was the second-longest-running title of any published by Rip Off Press (trailing only The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers).Fox, M.

Shelton, Tony Bell, and Joe E. Brown, Jr. collaborated on the Wonder Wart-Hog storyline \\"Battle of the Titans,\\" chapters 1‚Äì5, in issues #8-12, a collaboration that spanned 20 years from the start to the finish of the story. (Wonder Wart-Hog's last appearance in the title was in issue #22, published in 1989.) Shelton's The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers were also frequently featured in early issues, appearing in issues #1‚Äì14, skipping only issue #7. Along with Shelton, Bill Griffith (with his ongoing strip \\"Griffith Observatory\\"), Ted Richards, Frank Stack, Joel Beck, and Harry Driggs were frequent contributors to early issues. One of Fred Schrier's last comics pieces appeared in issue #3 (Mar. 1978). Dave Sheridan was a regular contributor from issues #3‚Äì9. With issue #8 (Apr. 1981), Rip Off Comix opened the doors of the anthology to European contributors with a new feature called \\"Cartoonists of the World\\". That issue featured a section on British cartoonists, including Alan Moore, Leo Baxendale, Edwin Pouncey, Steve Moore, Edward Barker, and Terry Gilliam. Issue #9 highlighted \\"comix from France,\\" including Jean-Marc Reiser, Bernard Willem Holtrop, Florence Cestac, and Charlie Schlingo. Issue #10 had a special section on Spanish cartoonists, including Guillem Cifr√©, Juan Mediavilla, Miguel Gallardo, Sento, Marti Riera Ferrer (Mart√≠), Francesc Capdevila (Max), Joaquim Aubert Puigarnau (Kim), Nazario Luque, Javier Montesol, and Simonides. Issue #11 devoted a section to Dutch cartoonists, including Joost Swarte, Kamagurka, Peter Pontiac, and Evert Geradts. Shelton edited issues #11‚Äì12.

Rixey was built by the Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California. 11,500 tons. 450 x 62 x 23.6. 18 knots. Her keel was laid as Alcoa Cruiser (MC Hull 177) 3 June 1941 and intended for use as a bauxite and passenger ship for the Alcoa Steamship Company. Rixey was launched on 30 December 1941; sponsored by Miss Betty Hammond, and designated for Navy use and assigned the name Rixey after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Acquired by the Navy 30 December 1942; and commissioned the same day, Captain Allen Hobbs in command. With a complement of 460, and a troop capacity of 1,166 or a bed capacity of 700, Rixey was named in honor of Rear Admiral Presley Marion Rixey, MC, USN. The USS Rixey saw much combat throughout its deployment in the Second World War. Unlike traditional hospital ships, the Rixey was fitted with weapons for her defense; this allowed her to operate just off of the beaches where Marines engaged Japanese forces. The Rixey ability to be in harm's way gave wounded troops more expedient access to medical care. Decommissioned 27 March 1946 after three years and three months active commission; returned to the Maritime Commission and simultaneously transferred to the Army Transportation Service on 9 September 1946.

A wound to the bark, caused by pruning, insects, poor branch angles or natural cracks and splits, causes sap to ooze from the wound. Bacteria may infect this sap causing it to darken and stain the bark, eventually taking on a foamy appearance and unpleasant odor. This slimy ooze becomes toxic to the bark and eats into the tree. Additionally, the fermented sap attracts insects like flies, ants, and maggots.  Cause  Slime flux occurs when a wound is made in a tree trunk through things such as natural growth cracks, frost, insects, birds, lawn mowers, cat scratches, or pruning wounds, which causal bacteria can enter. Once inside the xylem, the internal pressure of the tree is raised due to bacteria fermenting and emitting a gas mixture of methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, raising the internal pressure of the tree from the normal range of 5 to 10 psi up to 60 psi. This accumulation of liquid and gas causes that part of the tree to have a damp, dark brown appearance known as wetwood. Eventually, the pressure will cause the sap and gasses to burst through the xylem and out of cracks in the trunk and ooze down the side of the tree. This sap flux may be further infected by other pathogens once exposed to the air such as air-borne bacteria, yeast, and fungi, at which point it is known as slime flux. = Causal agents = Causal bacteria for the initial wetwood varies depending on the species of tree. The bacteria are commonly found in water and soils. Enterobacter cloacae is a causal bacteria of wetwood in American Elms. Xanthomonas spp., Argobacterium spp., Acinetobacter spp., Corynebacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Edwardsiella spp., Klebsiella spp., Lactobacillus spp., Methanobacterium spp., Brevundimonas bullata, Paracoccus spp. and Luteimonas aestuarri have also been isolated from wetwood in various tree species. Species of Prototheca have been isolated from slime fluxes.  Treatment  There is no cure, but the bark of a tree is like skin. The wound should be disinfected with rubbing alcohol or a household bleach solution of one part bleach to nine parts water. The excess sap should be wiped from the tree to discourage hungry insects. With prompt and continuous treatment, the tree should survive. In the forest, practices that minimize wounding will reduce the spread of this disease. For urban trees, maintaining vigorous, healthy growing conditions (thorough watering, mulching around the base and adding compost to the drip line) and avoiding wounds will reduce the probability that trees will be affected by this disease. Removing bark from the affected area will reduce damage to an individual tree. = Background = Slime flux or more commonly known as Wet wood is a seepage of the wood that is unseen by the human eye. The seepage is typically a sour smell that comes from the trunk of the tree.  Significance  The slime flux disease causes a constant odor, and bleeding cankers on the base of the tree. Slime flux can eventually kill a tree. the bacteria and pathogens Can spread to surrounding trees. Oozing liquid is a sign that there has been an earlier injury. In some cases, as the outer wound calluses over and the internal methane production decreases, the slime flux may stop in a year or two. In other cases slime flux may reoccur year after year.

It is based on a fornaldarsaga. Summary The story starts as many fairytales do: the fair princess has been captured and imprisoned in a faraway castle, and the King commissions a hero, in this case √Ösmund, to rescue her. He and his brothers take the King's flagship Ormin Lange to the castle of the ogre Skomegyvri, where the princess is imprisoned. However, his brothers will not enter with him, so he goes alone. He finds the princess with relative ease walking through the castle, and immediately falls in love with her. But she is under a spell of the ogre, and believing that Skomegyvri is her mother, will not leave with him. He then takes her by force. On his way out, the ogre appears. They fight a long battle both physically and with curses and spells, but √Ösmund eventually kills Skomegyvri. The princess being free from the spell, they plunder the castle and return home with all the ogre's treasure.

The principal character is a strong female Dutch sleuth who solves mysteries in exotic locales. Franka has been translated into a variety of languages, including Danish, German, French and Spanish. Principal character Franka (Francesca Victoria), the lead character that the series is named after, is a young, attractive and adventurous female private investigator.Note that some references incorrectly describe her as an archaeologist, though she has no professional training, nor is interest in archeology a major element. She does however start the series working for a criminology museum (Album #1, 'Misdaadmuseum'), and later on has her own PI agency, supporting the private investigator assessment. She lives in a slightly fictionalised version of the Netherlands, and since 1993's Flight of the Atlantis has clearly been revealed as a resident of Amsterdam (before, she lived in the fictional 'Groterdam'). The cases she solves often take place in the worlds of art, antiquities, fashion and film, and also often feature exotic locales full of smugglers, pirates and other shady businessmen. Dominant women are a recurring theme of the series, similar to other Franco- Belgian comics series such as Yoko Tsuno. A single woman for long time, Franka acquired a male partner and love interest in the later volumes, the reformed art thief Rix. More often than not she is also accompanied by her dog Bars. Franka was not the main character in the very first adventure of the series (an eight-page story which makes up the first part of Volume #1, Het Misdaadmuseum). Instead, Jarko (who is an increasingly minor character in all later volumes) played the central role, and Franka is only a secretary in the Criminology Museum. However, by the second (main) story of the first volume, Franka has become a central character, though not yet as exclusively so as in the later volumes. Drawing style Franka is an example of the ligne claire style frequently associated with European comics, and Kuijpers' drawing style is noted for its high artistic standards, particularly clarity of line and accurate detail of elements like cars and buildings. The panels often contain additional little interesting or humorous details not relevant to the main storyline. The style of drawing has developed significantly from the early comics, in which for example the characters had large eyes and squat proportions, to the more realistic figure drawing of the middle volumes to the slightly more stylized, 'fashion-designer' look of the latest issues. Also changed were the visual depiction of females - the Franka of the later volumes is a much more sexual creature than in the early volumes, where she only had friends, but never partners. While the early volumes rarely show nakedness, all volumes play with erotic poses and later volumes show Franka and other characters naked. Sexual acts, however, are generally only hinted at, though, again, this becomes more explicit in the later volumes. Publications =Publication history= Franka originally appeared in the weekly comic magazine Pep which, in 1975, merged with Sjors into Eppo. Franka became one of the magazine's fixtures for the next eleven years (1984 being her one sabbatical-year). In 1988 Eppo became Sjors & Sjimmie but it took another year before Franka made her comeback. In 1992 she returned to annual appearances starting at the beginning of the year. After Sjors & Sjimmie (or Sjosji as it was known since 1994) ceased publication in 1999 Franka went on to become the subject of her own online magazine. In February 2009 Eppo was revived as a forthnightly magazine appealing to original readers as well as their offspring; Franka is one of several household names to be included. In January 2010, she was voted Dutch comic strip heroine of all time. From the 1990s onwards, Franka was also serialised in Veronica Magazine, the magazine of Veronica TV, which with weekly sales of over 1,000,000 was among the most widely circulated Dutch periodicals. Franka has also been published in German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Scandinavian languages, as well as in French (Spirou). Incidents from previous volumes are often referred to in the subsequent ones, although they can be read independently. =Albums in the official series= The following are the Dutch language editions.

As the Babylon station was conceived as a political and cultural meeting place, one of the show's many themes is the cultural and social interaction between civilizations. There are five dominant civilizations represented on Babylon 5: humans, the Narn, the Centauri, the Minbari and the Vorlons; and several dozen less powerful ones. A number of the less powerful races make up the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, which assembled as a result of the Dilgar War, which occurred 30 years before the start of the series. Main characters =Jeffrey Sinclair / Valen= Jeffrey Sinclair, played by actor Michael O'Hare, is the Commander of the Babylon 5 station in season 1. After one full season, O'Hare and series executive producer/creator J. Michael Straczynski made the mutual and amicable decision for the character and actor to depart as a regular.Original GEnie post Message 560 by Straczynski on Fri May 20, 1994 O'Hare subsequently reprised the character of Sinclair briefly in season two and a two-episode guest appearance in season three, enabling the show to wrap up loose ends. As a result of this departure, there are several minor inconsistencies between the first season and the remainder of the show, most visibly in \\"And the Sky Full of Stars\\" and \\"Babylon Squared\\". At O'Hare's personal request, the full reasons for his departure from the show were kept secret until after his death in 2012. The following year, Straczynski revealed that O'Hare struggled with delusions and paranoia due to mental illness, which ultimately prevented him from continuing to act. However, Straczynski emphasized that O'Hare's fans, particularly those of his role as Sinclair, had helped him cope with his struggle in ways medication never could. The character's backstory is given as having been born on Mars Colony. In an early episode of season one, Sinclair states that his family had been pilots \\"ever since the Battle of Britain\\" and Sinclair's father was a fighter pilot for EarthForce who participated in the Battle of Balos, the last engagement of the Dilgar Invasion. Sinclair continued the tradition and became a fighter pilot. Sinclair enlisted in EarthForce in 2237. During his time at EarthForce Academy, he met Catherine Sakai, with whom he had a relationship. After a year of living together, the two of them broke up, but continued to see each other off and on through 2258, when they became engaged. Sakai went missing in late 2259, while on a mission for the Rangers.Her disappearance is explained in this canon novel, To Dream in the City of Sorrows. The season one episode \\"By Any Means Necessary\\" establishes that Sinclair received Jesuit education as a young man. In 2240, Sinclair was promoted to fighter pilot, continuing a Sinclair family tradition that had extended as far back as the Battle of Britain. Less than a year later, Sinclair was promoted to squadron leader; due to his rapid rise through the ranks, the rumor of the day was that Sinclair was on the fast track to making Admiral. As squadron leader, Sinclair fought at the Battle of the Line, the last major battle in the Earth-Minbari War. During the course of the battle, his squadron was destroyed by the Minbari, and his fighter was badly damaged. In a last act of defiance, Sinclair attempted to ram one of the Minbari cruisers. He failed in this when he was captured by another Minbari cruiser for interrogation by the Grey Council. The Council's Triluminary detected Valen's DNA in Sinclair, so they assumed, to their profound shock, that he possessed the soul of Valen, a hero of the Minbari who led them to victory 1,000 years ago against the Shadows. It was concluded by the Grey Council that Minbari souls were being born into human bodies. The discovery of what Sinclair possessed led the Minbari to surrender and return Sinclair to his fighter, the memory of his time aboard the Minbari cruiser blocked (though this block would not be permanent and would break down years later). Sinclair ‚Äî and the Earth Alliance ‚Äî believed that he had blacked out from the acceleration. When Babylon 5 was brought into operation in 2257, Sinclair was selected by the Minbari to command the newly constructed station. He was selected over many more senior officers, including Colonel Ari Ben Zayn, all of whom had been vetoed by the Minbari (they had stipulated that they should approve the choice of Station Commander, as they had shared the cost of construction). In January 2259, Sinclair was reassigned as ambassador to Minbar, where he took command of the Rangers. He was succeeded at Babylon 5 by Captain John Sheridan. In 2260, Sinclair received a 900-year old letter from himself on Minbar, revealing that he was not the reincarnation of Valen, as the Grey Council believed, but in fact Valen himself. Armed with this knowledge, Sinclair took Babylon 4 back with him 1,000 years to aid the Minbari in their first war against the Shadows, and in so doing, fulfilled Minbari prophecy by becoming the One Who Was. It was here that Sinclair used the triluminary to transform himself into a Minbari, thus fulfilling the legend about Valen being \\"a Minbari not born of Minbari\\", also explaining why the triluminary responded so strongly to him during his interrogation by the Grey Council, as it had been programmed to respond to his DNA. =John Sheridan= * Bruce Boxleitner as Captain John Sheridan (seasons 2-5): Sinclair's replacement on Babylon 5 after his reassignment, and a central figure of several prophecies within the Shadow war. =Susan Ivanova= * Claudia Christian as Lt. Commander Susan Ivanova (seasons 1-4, guest season 5): Second in command to Babylon 5. =Michael Garibaldi= Michael Garibaldi was played by Jerry Doyle in seasons 1-5. He is named after the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi.Straczynski, J. Michael (Jms at B5), JMS: Origin of name Giribaldi, The J. Michael Straczynski Message Archive, 9/26/1994 In the first three seasons, Garibaldi serves as chief of security on board the space station Babylon 5. He holds the rank of Chief Warrant Officer. In season 4, during the Shadow War, Garibaldi is secretly subjected to mental reprogramming, which is triggered after the war. Garibaldi resigns from his job as chief of security to work as an independent investigator, helping people find what they had lost during the war. Increasingly, he comes into conflict with Babylon 5 staff. Eventually, Bester releases Garibaldi from his psychic conditioning by making subtle adjustments to Garibaldi's personality. Garibaldi starts drinking again in season 5. Eventually, his long-time lover Lise Hampton returns to Babylon 5 to help support him. They marry soon afterwards, and he leaves Babylon 5 to help her run Edgars Industries on Mars, one of the largest corporations on the planet. During the fifth and final season of Babylon 5 he was the Director of Covert Intelligence for the new Interstellar Alliance, a post similar to the present-day CIA Director. After the episode \\"Sleeping in Light\\" Garibaldi returns to his family on Mars. Upon arriving home, he finds that his daughter has won a tennis match. Garibaldi's life after Sheridan's departure is relatively peaceful. Series creator J. Michael Straczynski says that his ultimate fate would be much quieter than Garibaldi could have imagined. Three novels - the last book of the Psi Corp trilogy, and the last two books of the Centauri Prime trilogy - the authors explore the period between the end of Babylon 5 and Sheridan's \\"death\\" in 2281. =Delenn= Satai Delenn was played by Mira Furlan in seasons 1-5. She is the Minbari ambassador to Babylon 5. Delenn was originally conceived as being a male character (eventually destined to change into a female one) but played by a female actor, in order to give the character feminine mannerisms and therefore make him more \\"alien\\". The Babylon 5 pilot TV movie The Gathering was filmed with this in mind, but the computer alteration to Mira Furlan's voice to make it sound masculine wasn't convincing, so the idea was dropped and Delenn changed to being a female. The Minbari makeup used from then on gave Delenn a much more feminine appearance. When first appearing as the Minbari ambassador to Babylon 5, Delenn initially hides her status of being a leader of the Grey Council. At the start of the 2nd season, Delenn uses a special artifact to transform into a half-human, half-Minbari hybrid - initially treated with suspicion by humans and Minbari alike. Delenn was instrumental in also getting Sinclair to be stationed as the first Earth ambassador to Minbar, since unbeknownst to Sinclair initially, they chose him because he was the first human the Grey Council had any direct contact with during the Battle of the Line In season 2, Delenn and John Sheridan fall in love, which drives a further wedge between the Minbari religious and warrior castes, who soon break a thousand years of cooperation and begin a civil war against one another. After Sheridan and Babylon 5 break away from Earth, it is Delenn who rescues the station with a fleet of Minbari ships, but the cost of destroying the symbolic circle of the Grey Council. The religious and worker castes side with Babylon 5 and the Army of Light. Unfortunately, without the Grey Council keeping order, the divisions in Minbari society become so strong that civil war soon breaks out. It is later learned that Delenn herself is descended from Valen.\\"Atonement\\" Delenn is the \\"One who is,\\" representing both halves of the Minbari and human race merged, more literally merging in the marriage of Delenn and Sheridan. Together they become war leaders, with Delenn managing to bind together diverse planets and races into a great alliance. Sheridan was the \\"warrior\\", while she was the \\"spirit\\". This alliance ends the great war between the Shadow and Vorlon races, and ushers in the Third age for Mankind - a great time of growth and change. But after the Shadow War ended, both Delenn and Sheridan found their homeworlds embroiled in civil wars. Although her work had saved countless lives and ended the great war, she returned home to a world wrought with chaos and death. Delenn and the religious caste surrendered to the warrior clans. She then forced a showdown between herself and the new leader of the warrior caste. This would be a purification in which Delenn could sacrifice herself for her caste and for the Minbari people. With her sacrifice, the leadership of Minbar would continue to be held by the religious caste - not the warriors. Her old rival Neroon saved her life, however. And in his death cries he joined the religious caste, which returned to Delenn the balance of power. Delenn then gave control of the Grey Council to the worker caste, who had for many years stayed in the middle, as the religious and warrior castes simmered with disagreement. After John Sheridan refused to stand for re-election as President of the Interstellar Alliance, Delenn is chosen to succeed him. When she accepted the role, Sheridan takes command of the Rangers until his death; Delenn asks Ivanova to succeed him. =Stephen Franklin= Stephen Franklin was played by Richard Biggs in seasons 1-5. Franklin serves as the chief medical officer on the Babylon 5 space station. He first appeared in the episode \\"Soul Hunter\\". In the script of this episode, he was explicitly described as black. J. Michael Straczynski was adamant throughout the run of the series that Franklin be a true individual who could have been played by an actor of any race. Richard Biggs later expressed his gratitude at being able to play a role purely as an actor, not a black actor. Franklin has strong moral convictions. Although he spends most of the series in medlab saving lives, Franklin also sees his share of action and adventure during the series. He is an active participant in the Earth Alliance Civil War, where he aids the Mars Resistance in its fight to free the Mars colony from Earth control. During the war between the Centauri Republic and the Interstellar Alliance, he works with the telepath Lyta Alexander in investigating reports of Drazi atrocities against the Centauri on the Drazi homeworld. During the series's fifth and final season, Franklin resigns from his post at Babylon 5 to accept the position of \\"Head of Xenobiological Research\\" on Earth upon the retirement of Dr. Benjamin Kyle. He appears in the Crusade episode \\"Each Night I Dream of Home\\". J. Michael Straczynski has said that Franklin eventually dies while exploring an unknown planet, but has not revealed the details of exactly how or when he dies. When Biggs died in May 2004, Straczynski had been working on a Babylon 5 script titled The Memory of Shadows. Straczynski decided not to recast the Franklin character, and rewrote the script to remove him from the story. In the Babylon 5: The Lost Tales anthology, it is explained that both Franklin and G'Kar ‚Äì played by Andreas Katsulas who died in February 2006 ‚Äì had left to explore space beyond the \\"galactic rim\\". =Talia Winters= Talia Winter was portrayed by actress Andrea Thompson in season 1‚Äì2. Winters was a licensed, commercial telepath from Earth and a member of the Psi Corps organization. She was assigned to the Earth space station Babylon 5 in the year 2258 to serve as its second resident commercial telepath. Like all Psi Corps members, Winters' telepathic ability was numbered according to ability; Winters was classified as a P5, the level of most commercial telepaths. Typically, commercial telepaths were assigned to help two or more business parties broker deals, by monitoring their honesty during business negotiations. Talia Winters' telepathic abilities manifested at age five. As required by law, her parents immediately sent her to be raised, educated, and trained in her gifts by the Psi Corps. During this time Talia was also tested for telekinesis, but was disappointed to learn that she did not have enough to move even a penny. Over the years, Ms. Winters developed a strong loyalty to Psi Corps, and accepted an internship in the commercial telepath division. During this internship, she met and befriended Lyta Alexander, another P5 telepath who had transferred out of the Psi-Cop division. After completing her education, Winters entered the workforce as a commercial telepath. In 2258, Talia Winters arrived on Babylon 5 as its second resident commercial telepath. Her work on the station repeatedly brought her into contact with the command staff. Both of the station's commanding officers (Commander Jeffrey Sinclair and Captain John Sheridan) considered her a valuable ally despite her strong loyalty to Psi Corps. Security Chief Michael Garibaldi, who harbored a not-so-secret crush on Winters, was in frequent contact with her. Garibaldi would routinely flirt with her and show up in the stations' transport tubes just when she was about to board them. Although annoyed by his unsubtle advances, Winters remained friendly with him and used her Psi Corps connections to help him contact his former lover, Lise Hampton, during the riots on the Mars colony. Talia Winters's most complicated relationship was with Susan Ivanova, the station's second-in-command. Initially, Ivanova was hostile to Winters' arrival and refused to acknowledge her presence. She quickly discovered that Ivanova's mother was a telepath who, rather than joining the Corps and leaving her family, submitted to a decade's worth of drug injections which dampened her spirit along with her abilities. Ivanova blamed Psi Corps for her mother's suicide; her experience gave Talia her first opportunity to learn about the darker side of the Psi Corps. Also in 2258, Jason Ironheart arrived on the station in secret while on the run from the Psi Corps. The experiments he had participated in had strengthened his abilities to the point where he could telekinetically manipulate matter at the subatomic level. Ironheart gave his lover two gifts as he transformed into a being of pure energy: her own minor telekinetic abilities, substantially less powerful (and therefore less dangerous) than Ironheart's, and the ability to block the scans of P12 (the highest rated) telepaths. Winters put these new abilities to use the following year when Psi Cop Al Bester came to Babylon 5 to stop an underground railroad that Ironheart had set up for runaway telepaths. Her experience with the fugitive telepaths finally made her aware of how corrupt the Psi Corps had become. It was this epiphany that finally dissolved the tension between herself and Susan Ivanova; from that point on, the two women developed a mutual respect which later blossomed into a relationship. In 2259, dissident telepath Lyta Alexander learned of a Psi Corps sleeper program that the Psi Corps had hidden in her. Although she knew one such sleeper had been sent to Babylon 5 to spy on its command staff, she did not know the identity of the spy. Lyta traveled to Babylon 5 with the password that would activate the hidden personality. With the permission of Captain John Sheridan, Lyta sent the password into the minds of individuals among and close to the command staff. When she sent the password into Winters' mind, the hidden personality took full control of her psyche, effectively killing the Talia Winters that everyone had come to know. Talia became hostile and returned to Earth after the hidden personality took over. There were concerns among the stations' command staff over how much inside knowledge this new Ms. Winters could use against them. By that time, they had become convinced that then Vice President Clark had assassinated his predecessor with help from outsiders so he could assume the presidency, and they were clandestinely gathering evidence to that effect to ensure it was passed to members of the military who felt the same, and who could discreetly get it to the right hands. The staff had just agreed to bring Talia in on the operation, and were on the verge of doing so when Lyta had arrived to inform them of the sleeper. Garibaldi himself had mused that if Lyta had come one week later, they'd all be standing in front of a summary court martial board, if not worse. Psi Cop Bester hinted that she was dissected after arriving back on Earth, saying, \\"We learned some interesting things about Ms Winters in the course of her debriefing and dissect‚Äîthat is, examination.\\" =Vir Cotto= Vir Cotto was played by Stephen Furst in seasons 1-5. He is a Centauri male who was from a family of minor nobility. Vir first appears in the episode \\"Midnight on the Firing Line\\" as an assistant to Ambassador Londo Mollari. At the time, Vir was an embarrassment to his family, and his family arranged for him to be assigned to this position as a means of getting him as far away from them as possible. In the first two seasons, Vir proves himself to be an able assistant to Ambassador Mollari and also develops a friendship with Ambassador Lennier. Vir appears less frequently during the third season, since Stephen Furst had taken a role in a sitcom and couldn't appear in many episodes. This was explained in-universe as a reassignment as liaison to Minbar. Mollari arranges to have this happen in order to help Vir further develop in his career, but privately admits to Delenn that he does not want Vir around with the events - namely the Shadow War - that are soon to come. Vir Cotto remains an important character during the Shadow War arc, which comprises parts of season 3 and 4. Vir was once again used as a \\"moral counterpart\\" to Mollari towards the end of the Shadow War arc. Mollari has Vir come to Centauri Prime to assist in the assassination of Emperor Cartagia. The assassination plot goes astray, with Vir finally being the person to kill the Emperor. Following the Shadow War, Vir returns to Babylon 5. In season 4 and 5, he continues to act as Mollari's assistant, and as a representative of the Centauri to Babylon 5 when Mollari is back on Centauri Prime. When Mollari ascends to the throne as Emperor, he names Vir as the Ambassador to Babylon 5, by then an important position. Vir appears after the main series in \\"The Fall of Centauri Prime\\" trilogy of tie-in novels, and is Emperor of the Centuari Republic twenty years after the end of the Shadow War, as shown in \\"Sleeping in Light\\". =Lennier= Lennier was played by Bill Mumy in seasons 1-5. He is Minbari and acts as ambassadorial aide to Delenn throughout most of the series. Just as Delenn was an acolyte of Dukhat, Lennier was the faithful acolyte of Minbari Ambassador Delenn for five years. A member of the Third Fane of Chu'Domo of the religious caste and a fierce fighter, he later joined the Rangers. He had family aboard the Minbari flagship Black Star when it was destroyed by Babylon 5 commander John Sheridan. Though other Minbari felt much animosity towards Sheridan, as they felt he'd acted dishonorably in destroying it, Lennier held no hard feelings, apparently understanding why Sheridan had done it, despite having family on the Black Star when it was destroyed. In the episode \\"Day of the Dead,\\" Lennier is confronted by the ghost of Morden, the human who worked with the Shadows. Lennier, who had returned from training hoping to speak to a spirit as part of an alien religious observance, makes the mistake of asking Morden for wisdom. Morden predicts that Lennier will one day betray the Rangers. This encounter presages several later events in the series. Eventually it was revealed that Lennier was secretly in love with Delenn. However he explained to Marcus Cole that it was \\"not romantic love as you would understand it, something nobler.\\" Lennier did not act on his feelings due to her involvement with John Sheridan. Lennier did confess his feelings to her when he and Delenn were both trapped in hyperspace facing death, but Delenn, who had long known of his feelings for her, feigned that she hadn't heard his confession in order to spare him embarrassment. Lennier's feelings later caused his downfall. When Sheridan suffered an accident aboard a White Star (\\"Objects at Rest\\"), Lennier, seeing for the opportunity to remove his 'competition', refused to help him and fled, for a short moment leaving him for dead. Almost immediately after he realized the foolishness of his actions and did come back, but by then Sheridan had managed to rescue himself. Lennier ran away, deeply ashamed of what he had done, and was never heard from again, except for a final, untraceable call to Delenn in which he asked her and Sheridan for forgiveness. This would likely constitute his \\"Betrayal of the Rangers\\" as predicted by Morden. The series left Lennier's final fate unknown, although most of Morden's prophecies came true and there are hints in the series finale \\"Sleeping in Light\\" (during a sequence when the guests were remembering their fallen friends), that Lennier was killed in the Telepath War. This has been confirmed by J. Michael Straczynski in The Babylon 5 Scripts of J. Michael Straczynski TV Movies, in which he writes that both Lennier and Lyta Alexander were killed in the explosion of Psi Corps Headquarters in a major battle of the Telepath War. Straczynski had previously said of Lennier's death (in his commentary for \\"Sleeping in Light\\"): \\"That's a very sad story, and maybe I'll tell it some day.\\" =Elizabeth Lochley= Elizabeth Lochley was played by Tracy Scoggins in the fifth and last season of Babylon 5, replacing the previous commander of the station, John Sheridan, and filling the role of the character Susan Ivanova. She was also a semi-regular character in Crusade, where she has a romantic relationship with Matthew Gideon, the Captain of the Excalibur. Lochley featured prominently in the first volume of Babylon 5: The Lost Tales entitled \\"Voices in the Dark\\", released on DVD in July 2007. Due to a troubled youth, Lochley never consumed alcoholic beverages or other drugs from the moment she began her military career. After Captain Sheridan is relieved of his command, he requests Earth to assign Lochley as his replacement. Although she chose not to join Sheridan's rebellion against the corrupt government headed by Morgan Clark, he still trusted her judgment and ability. The show later reveals that Sheridan and Lochley had been married briefly after graduating from EarthForce Academy. While the marriage didn't work out, they still have a mutual respect and appreciation. She proved to be a strong and capable leader, finding solutions to many crises and coping with the ones that had no solutions. During the Brakiri Day of the Dead, in which the dead return for one night, the Brakiri on the station purchase a part of it for the night which includes Lochley's quarters. She is subsequently visited by Zoe, who confirms that she had in fact deliberately committed suicide by overdosing on drugs. Prior to this, nobody knew for sure if Zoe's death was an accidental overdose or a deliberate suicide. The series Crusade is set approximately five years after the events of the fifth season of Babylon 5 and show that she is still the Captain. In Babylon 5: The Lost Tales, Lochley is still in command of the station but now holds the rank of EarthForce Colonel. It is unknown whether she and Gideon are still intimate. During her communication with President Sheridan, Lochley says of Dr Stephen Franklin \\"Oh, I thought you'd heard. Doctor Franklin went with G'Kar, exploring beyond the Rim.\\" This was filmed in the last quarter of 2006, with actor Richard Biggs (Franklin) having died in 2004 and actor Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) having died in February 2006, several months prior to principal photography on The Lost Tales. Actor Tracy Scoggins, who portrays Lochley, admitted on the DVD commentary to having difficulty to delivering the line, at one point nearly breaking down in tears. The line was a subtle eulogy to both actors. =Marcus Cole= Marcus Cole was played by Jason Carter in the third and fourth seasons of the show. During his time on the series he was a leading member of the Rangers, a military force consisting of Humans and Minbari who served the \\"One\\", a triumvirate consisting of Jeffrey Sinclair / Valen, Delenn, and John Sheridan. The character's backstory is given as being born on the Arisia Mining Colony, where his family operated a relatively dangerous mining operation. His brother William had left the colony and become a Ranger on Minbar; he was killed by the Shadows while visiting Marcus on Arisia. Marcus was one of the few survivors (if not the only survivor) of the attack. Much of Marcus Cole's early background is told in the novel To Dream In the City of Sorrows by Kathryn Drennan. Marcus Cole joined the Rangers following the death of his brother, William, and at times he seems to have joined the Rangers as a form of guilt over his brother's death. Cole became close friends with Dr. Stephen Franklin. Defending Delenn during her transition to become \\"Ranger One\\", Cole engaged Neroon in a fierce one-on-one battle. Despite losing, and nearly being killed, he earned Neroon's respect, even getting Neroon to laugh warmly. It was also revealed on the show (episode: The Summoning) that Marcus Cole was a virgin, a character aspect which was a marked departure for a dashing hero role. However, the combination of his virginity and fighting skill once led him to (only half-jokingly) compare himself to Sir Galahad (A Late Delivery From Avalon). He fell in love with Susan Ivanova. However, the two did not become involved in the course of the television series. Some attribute this to Ivanova's previous history of disastrous romantic relationships, such as her relationship with Talia Winters. Later, after a devastating attack on Ivanova and Cole's White Star during the battle to reclaim Earth from the tyrannical government of President Clark, Cole took the severely injured Ivanova to Babylon 5. Using an alien execution device that takes one person's life-energy and transfers it to another, he sacrificed his life to save hers. His corpse was then preserved by Ivanova's request in cryogenic suspension in the future hope that he might be revived. This was actually not shown in the series, but in the credits of \\"Sleeping in Light\\". The credits showed each character as we first saw them and as we last saw them, and the last image of Cole showed a cryogenic capsule showing that he was preserved at Captain Ivanova's request. Cole's story concludes in \\"Space, Time & the Incurable Romantic\\", a short story written by JMS and published in Amazing Stories #602. It takes place hundreds of years after the series ends. Cole (still preserved in cryogenic suspension) is revived when the homeworld of those who built the life-energy transfer machine was found. He then proceeds to create a clone of Ivanova by enlisting one of Garibaldi's descendants to help him. Endowing it with her exact memories by stealing the scans done of her memory, he then strands them on a lush, fertile and uncharted world with the intent of living \\"happily ever after\\" together. There are significant moral questions raised by his actions in this story, but JMS has been quoted as \\"wishing to give the character the happy ending he deserves\\" while at the same time raising the type of ethical question for which Babylon 5 is famous. =Na'Toth= Na'Toth is the aide to Narn Ambassador G'Kar. She was played by Julie Caitlin Brown in the first season (a last-minute casting change after Susan Kellerman walked off the set). Due to problems with the extensive makeup and prosthetics required to turn her into a Narn, For the second season, Brown was replaced by Mary Kay Adams. Executive producer J. Michael Straczynski quickly became dissatisfied with Adams' more understated approach to the role, and Na'Toth was written out of the series after appearing in two more episodes. Brown returned to reprise the role in the fifth-season episode \\"A Tragedy of Telepaths\\". In The Babylon Files, a Babylon 5 guidebook, series creator Straczynski said he had considered having G'Kar have a \\"revolving-door\\" series of aides, akin to Murphy Brown. Na'Toth was the second aide to G'Kar, after his first aide Ko'Dath died in an airlock accident. When Na'Toth arrived, a member of the Narn assassins' guild was attempting to kill G'Kar at the behest of an old rival. G'Kar was eventually kidnapped by the assassin. Na'Toth went to the assassin and claimed to be his backup. She was then able to disable the pain device that had been placed on G'Kar, allowing G'Kar to defeat the assassin, who left the station before the assassin guild had him killed. Na'Toth went home to Narn at some point during the second season. She was on Narn when the Centauri used mass drivers to pluck asteroids out of orbit and bomb the Narn homeworld. Na'Toth was missing and presumed dead. In the fifth season, Na'Toth was found to be alive and imprisoned in the Centauri Royal Palace (\\"A Tragedy of Telepaths\\"). Londo Mollari and G'Kar smuggled her from the palace, and arranged for her to be sent back home to receive treatment for her injuries. Na'Toth did not appear in any further Babylon 5 television episodes or movies. The short story True Seeker, published in the July 2000 issue 23 of the Official Babylon 5 Magazine, depicts Na'Toth as living on Narn in the winter of 2269 and enjoying a state of celebrity. The book Out of the Darkness by Peter David suggested that as of 2278 Na'Toth was still alive and living on Narn. =Zack Allan= Zack Allan was played by Jeff Conaway. He regularly appeared in the show from season 2 onwards. During the second and third seasons of the series he was a security officer on the Babylon 5 station. In the fourth season, he was promoted to become Babylon 5's Security Chief and he retains that position through to the end of the series' fifth and final season. Briefly in season 2 and 3, Allan was a member of Nightwatch, a civilian para-police force created by Earth Alliance President Morgan Clark to expose and arrest \\"traitors to Earth\\". True to form, Zack joined Nightwatch for the bonus pay they offered, without paying much attention to their political views and fascist nature. However, he had the truth of their nature driven home when a shopkeeper accused of sedition for publicly criticizing Clark's presidency was physically dragged away from his store and imprisoned by Nightwatch officers in the episode, \\"The Fall of Night\\". After this experience Zack agreed to help Babylon 5's command staff, eventually playing a critical role in \\"Point of No Return\\" in leading the bulk of the station's Nightwatch into a trap set up to capture them. Allan was the second aide to B5 Chief of Security Michael Garibaldi from 2259-2261. Following Garibaldi's resignation as chief of security in season 4, Allan was appointed Chief of Security. He held the position for many years; except for a brief stint back on Earth, he remained there until the station was decommissioned in 2281. Because of this, he was the only one not to receive his invitation to Sheridan's farewell party in Sleeping in Light, though Allan would still meet Sheridan one more time as Sheridan took one last walk through the station. In Sleeping in Light, he walked with a noticeable limp, which has never been explained on screen. In the voiceover commentary of the episode, series creator J. Michael Straczynski explained that Zack was involved in heroic activity and lost his leg. In keeping with his previous experience with uniforms, it is suggested that the prosthetic he was supplied with never fit correctly. Later in the episode, after the aged and abandoned Babylon 5 was destroyed and the Drakh influence on Centauri Prime was exposed and eliminated, Zack joined the Rangers and became Centauri Emperor Vir Cotto's assistant. =Lyta Alexander= Lyta Alexander was played by Patricia Tallman. Lyta was introduced in the pilot episode \\"The Gathering\\" as a telepath assigned to the Babylon 5 space station by the Psi Corps, a fictional organization providing support to telepaths and monitoring their activity. However, she did not appear in the remainder of Season One due to a dispute concerning Tallman's salary.Tallman, Patricia.Pleasure Thresholds .2011 Lyta's role in the series was largely taken up by Andrea Thompson, who was cast as Talia Winters, a telepath who took over Lyta's responsibilities in the station. After Thompson left the series due to disagreements regarding the amount of screen time given to her character,http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-69 . Originally posted to newsgroup rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated on 2000-11-23. Lyta returned as a recurring character in Seasons Two and Three, after Capt. John Sheridan took over as station commander, and became a regular cast member from Season Four onward. Her character simply resumed the dramatic arc once intended for Thompson's. In the series' pilot, she is described as a sixth-generation telepath, although she points out that telepathy may have been running in her family undetected even earlier, since telepaths were not monitored before that generation. In the series it is stated that Lyta was trained by the Psi Corps, and that she briefly interned with the Psi Cops division.\\"Divided Loyalties,\\" Babylon 5. 1995-10-11. After an incident whilst accompanying Alfred Bester,\\"The Face of the Enemy,\\" Babylon 5. 1997-06-09. she transferred to commercial work. In 2257, she was assigned as Babylon 5's first commercial telepath.\\"The Gathering,\\" Babylon 5. 1993-02-22. Soon after arriving at the station, she scanned Vorlon Ambassador Kosh, in violation of the wishes of the Vorlon government, in order to try to discover the identity of his attacker. In Season Two, Lyta's experience with the Vorlon ambassador permanently changed her. She was recalled from her assignment a few weeks later and questioned regarding her encounter with Kosh. Interrogated for months by the Psi Corps, she eventually escaped and joined the Mars Resistance. While underground, she uncovered information regarding a mole among the Babylon 5 command staff, and returned to the station in late 2259 where she revealed Talia Winters as an unwitting mole for secret forces in EarthGov and Psi Corps. In season 3, Lyta travelled to the Vorlon homeworld, one of the few known humans to do so and live. There, she was modified by the Vorlons, given gill-like implants to allow her to breathe in a Vorlon environment, the ability to \\"carry\\" a Vorlon consciousness, and tremendously increased telepathic and psychokinetic powers. Even she did not initially realize the full potency of her new abilities. She returned to Babylon 5 as an aide to Ambassador Kosh.\\"Passing Through Gethsemane,\\" Babylon 5. 1995-11-27. In Season Four, Lyta was key to eventual resolution of the Shadow War on Coriana 6, serving as the vessel through which Sheridan and Delenn confronted the elder races and forced them to leave the galaxy.\\"Into the Fire,\\" Babylon 5. 1997-02-03. Immediately after the Shadow War, she was part of the expedition to the Shadows' homeworld of Z'ha'dum. Using unknown abilities and implanted instructions from the Vorlons, she triggered the destruction of the planet to spite Alfred Bester and to prevent Shadow technology from falling into the wrong hands.\\"Epiphanies,\\" Babylon 5. 1997-02-10. However, after the conclusion of the Shadow War, she found herself unwelcome and had difficulty finding employment. She would go on to play a decisive role in the end game of the Earth Civil War, triggering the Shadow-modified telepaths smuggled aboard Earth ships to disable the fleet at Mars.\\"Endgame,\\" Babylon 5. 1997-10-13. In Season Five, Alexander became romantically involved with Byron, revealing to the telepaths that they had been created by the Vorlons as weapons for their war with the Shadows. After Byron's death, Alexander was inspired by his cause to create a homeworld for telepaths, and became the leader of a movement sponsoring violent resistance against the Corps. Lyta also began to more thoroughly explore the abilities the Vorlons had given her. She was eventually arrested aboard Babylon 5 for supporting terrorism by John Sheridan.\\"Wheel of Fire,\\" Babylon 5. 1998-11-04. Alexander then struck a deal with Michael Garibaldi to help her avoid prosecution, as well as provide funding for her cause. Former Narn Ambassador G'Kar took her with him on a mission of exploration.\\"Objects in Motion,\\" Babylon 5. 1998-11-11. Lyta does not appear in any of the canonical material released since the end of the series. It is strongly implied in Crusade and some of the canonical novels that her actions (both on Babylon 5 in 2262 and afterward) led to the Telepath War of the mid-2260s, in which she was killed. According to Straczynski, Lyta was intended to appear in the Crusade episode \\"The Path of Sorrows\\" as part of a flashback, but Tallman's salary could not be negotiated. The scene as aired featured an unnamed telepath who died striking against the Psi Corps. Whether or not this was intended to be Lyta, Straczynski confirmed Lyta did die in such an attack. In the aforementioned script book, Straczynski wrote that both Lyta and Lennier were killed in the explosion of Psi Corps Headquarters in a major battle of the Telepath War. Hints about her death had also been stated by Straczynski in posts to the Babylon 5 newsgroup, and in the final novel of the Psi Corps Trilogy by J. Gregory Keyes.Keyes, J. Gregory. Final Reckoning: The Fate of Bester, p. 228. New York: Del Rey, 1999. =G'Kar= G'Kar is the Narn ambassador to Babylon 5 and was played by Andreas Katsulas in seasons 1-5. He makes his first appearance in The Gathering as a villainous diplomat opposite Londo Mollari, being constantly engaged in insidious, if petty and often comical schemes, usually driven by his hostility to his people's historical enemies, the Centauri, whom Londo represents. However, in the course of the series, he is transformed into a Messianic figure and the foremost spiritual leader of his people. The character last appears in Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers. =Londo Mollari= Londo Mollari was played by Peter Jurasik in seasons 1-5. As a member of one of the oldest Noble Houses of the Centauri Republic, he is the Centauri ambassador to Babylon 5. In the words of series creator J. Michael Straczynski, he is ‚Äúoverweight, prone to gambling constantly (null-pool is his favorite) and fond of women and drinks‚Äù. At the start of the series, Londo seems to be ineffective in his role as ambassador. As the events of the Shadow War come to a peak, Mollari is promoted to the position of advisor on planetary security. Later, with Cartagia dead and a Vorlon fleet en route to destroy Centauri Prime, Mollari is promoted to the position of Prime Minister, making him temporarily head of state until a new Emperor can be elected. Following the galactic war with the Shadows, Mollari eventually rises to become Emperor of the Centauri Republic, taking the title Emperor Mollari II, since another member of his family was Emperor in the past. Earth Alliance The Earth Alliance was a major galactic superpower in the Babylon 5 universe. The name of its military force is EarthForce. Earth Alliance had gained more technology than any other race in the known Babylon 5 universe: Dilgar, Narn, Centauri, Shadow, Minbari, and Vorlon tech all at one point in time. It was founded at the end of the twenty- first century, after the Third World War: first as a loose coalition of nations, then as a tight alliance of nearly every nation on Earth as well as Alliance-controlled colonies throughout the Galaxy, though colonial populations have had a history of independence-driven rebellion, especially Mars. The Alliance is a unicameral representative democracy under the leadership of an elected President with a strong military. In one second- season episode (\\"And Now For a Word\\"), the Alliance is said to consist of 24 outposts and colonies in over a dozen solar systems. Since the end of the Earth-Minbari War, the Alliance had prospered in interstellar trade, though some influential factions had become increasingly xenophobic and isolationist. Following the assassination of President Luis Santiago, the new President, Morgan Clark, formed Nightwatch (a pervasive secret police) and dissolved the Senate, turning Earth and her colonies into a totalitarian fascist state. =Ari Ben Zayn= Colonel Ari Ben Zayn (Gregory Martin) is an EarthForce Intelligence officer who investigated Commander Jeffrey Sinclair and his command staff in the Babylon 5 episode \\"Eyes\\". Colonel Ben Zayn's investigation was one of several conducted by Earth Force Internal Affairs as the events on Mars were putting the command staff of colonies and stations in question. Ben Zayn's interest was not of investigation, but one of asserting control as he was passed over for command of Babylon 5 in favour of Sinclair by the Minbari, which did not sit well with Ben Zayn. Ben Zayn's true intentions were discovered by his Psi Corps Military Specialist Harriman Gray, as Ben Zayn is a close friend of Psi Corps official Alfred Bester. He was defeated by Gray and Sinclair and sent back to Earth for investigation into his activities. =David Corwin= David Corwin (Josh Coxx) is a C&C; (Command and Control, or Observation Dome) worker. The character appears in seasons one through five, Thirdspace and The River of Souls. First credited as \\"Tech #1\\" he becomes Lt. JG David Corwin. He is later promoted to full Lieutenant. He occasionally fills in for the lack of a Second in Command in season five (see also B5 government). In River of Souls, which takes place after the station is returned to Earth Alliance jurisdiction, it is implied that he has been officially made XO. He is named for Norman Corwin. =Richard Franklin= General Richard Franklin is an EarthForce general. His sole screen appearance was in the episode \\"Gropos\\". Richard Franklin is the father of Babylon 5's chief of medical staff, Doctor Stephen Franklin. The relationship between father and son is strained, due to the General's Human-centric beliefs. Richard Franklin was often away from home as Stephen was raised. Franklin is the commander of the Earth Alliance 356th Infantry Division and is known by the nicknames \\"Old Firestorm\\", \\"Hero of the Canal Wars\\", \\"Scourge of Janos 7\\" and \\"Liberator of the African Block\\". =General William Hague= General William Hague is Chairman of EarthForce's Joint Chiefs of Staff and the first leader of the resistance against the authoritarian regime of Earth Alliance President Morgan Clark. Hague was able to escape the Sol system on board the EAS Alexander. EarthForce ships that remained loyal to Hague were hunted down and destroyed leaving only the Alexander. Hague was killed shortly after in a firefight with the EAS Clarkstown. He was replaced as the leader of the resistance by Captain John Sheridan. Foxworth portrays Hague in two episodes as a supporting role for John Sheridan as a contact in the underground resistance against Morgan Clark. Many of the characters mention his name on referring to the sub-arc regarding the resistance which lends importance to Hague's role offscreen. =General Robert Lefcourt= General Robert Lefcourt was portrayed by actor J. Patrick McCormack. General Lefcourt first appeared in Babylon 5: In the Beginning where he and another Earth Alliance official quizzed ambassador Londo Mollari about the Minbari. Despite being warned by Mollari to send only a single ship to make contact with the Minbari lest they are perceived as a threat, Lefcourt brashly asserted that the Earth Alliance had taken care of the Dilgar and it could take care of the Minbari as well. Mollari commented that this attitude was both arrogant and stupid however he did give all information that the Centauri held about the Minbari. Despite Mollari's warning General Lefcourt decided to send a small task force to the border of Minbari space. The expedition was led by the EAS Prometheus under the command of Captain Michael Jankowski. The task force unexpectedly encountered three Minbari warships, one of which contained the Grey Council. Jankowski initially refused to jump back into hyperspace, preferring to wait to the last moment so they could get as much information on the Minbari ships as possible. By the time Jankowski decided to jump the Earth ship's jump engines had been accidentally disabled by the Minbari. He then misinterpreted the meaning of the Minbari ships opening their gunports and panicked, ordering his ships to open fire. When the Minbari leader Dukhat was killed it led to the opening of hostilities between the Minbari and the Earth Alliance. Following this General Lefcourt and General Fontaine appear to lead EarthForce's losing effort against the Minbari. The pair are shown briefing EarthForce personnel after the initial Minbari attacks and again later when they show replays of Commander John Sheridan's victory over the Minbari flagship the Drala Fi'. Following this he gives Sheridan and Dr Stephen Franklin a mission to meet with a Minbari representative on a neutral planet to discuss peace. He tells Sheridan in no uncertain terms that if the Minbari want Earth's surrender then he is to give them it, to ensure the survival of the human race. Thirteen years after the end of the Earth-Minbari war the Earth Alliance had slipped into civil war with the now Captain John Sheridan leading a rebellion against the authoritarian regime of Earth Alliance President, Morgan Clark. Sheridan's fleet manages to overcome all EarthForce resistance before mounting an attack on the Sol System. General Lefcourt is selected by Clark to command a fleet of 35 Omega class destroyers who make their stand at Mars. He is selected not because of any particular loyalty to Clark but because of his belief that soldiers should not take up arms against their own government no matter the cause. Sheridan was also a pupil of his at the EarthForce academy and it was thought that he would know his tactics best. Taking command of the EAS Apollo he dismissed the ground attacks by the Mars resistance and a single White Star commanded by Marcus Cole as a diversion and refused to allow his fleet to turn back to take them on. Minutes later most of Lefcourt's fleet is disabled by Shadow altered telepaths and the rest are put out of action by Sheridan's White Star fleet. Security aboard the Apollo soon find and eliminate the telepath onboard but the ship remains adrift. General Lefcourt threatens the engineering crew to get the ship under control and when they finally manage to do so he orders them to Earth in pursuit of Sheridan's fleet. The Apollo made a timely arrival, and President Clark - in a final vindictive act before committing suicide - had ordered the planetary defence grid to fire on Earth. Sheridan's fleet managed to destroy all the platforms except one. With it about to fire on the North American seaboard, the EAS Agamemnon under Captain Sheridan's command was the only ship in range able to destroy it. The Agamemnon's weapon systems were inoperative, however, and Sheridan ordered the Agamemnon to ram the platform. Seconds before it would have. the Apollo exits hyperspace and destroys the final platform, General Lefcourt then welcomes Captain Sheridan home. =Jack= Jack was Michael Garibaldi's aide (Macaulay Bruton, who also portrays the character Tragedy in Season One \\"Eyes\\"), a recurring character in Seasons One and Two of Babylon 5. He is both implicated in, and explicitly involved in, events that lead to the death of Earth Alliance President Luis Santiago, and the \\"coming darkness.\\" Perhaps most powerfully, he shoots Garibaldi in the back at the end of Season One (\\"Chrysalis\\"), preventing Garibaldi from warning Sinclair in time about the assassination attempt on Santiago, resulting in it being successful. In the Season Two episode \\"Revelations\\", Garibaldi regains consciousness, and with the help of Talia Winters, Talia helps Garibaldi telepathically retrieve his memory of being shot, and sees Jack's reflection in a mirror. Jack is arrested by Lou Welch & station security, but President Clark personally contacts Captain Sheridan, and orders Sheridan to have Jack sent back to Earth. Enroute to Earth, the transport carrying Jack and all of the evidence regarding Garibaldi's attempted murder, is intercepted by a second unknown EarthForce transport (later found out to have been sent by President Clark's agents) and taken away to safety; his ultimate fate is unknown. Jack had connections with Psi Cop Alfred Bester & Psi Corps, as Jack was contacted telepathically by Bester & later gave Garibaldi the same salute that Bester gave Commander Sinclair in Season One \\"Mind War\\". =Susanna Luchenko= Susanna Luchenko (Beata Pozniak) becomes the President of the Earth Alliance following the overthrow and suicide of President Morgan Clark; Clark had assumed dictatorial powers. She plays a key role in ending Clark's oppressive policies, including ending his martial law decree, and restoring democracy to the Earth Alliance. Luchenko had previously represented the Russian Consortium in the Earth Senate. When she became President of the Earth Alliance, she appealed to the people of the Alliance to remain calm, and not to resort to committing acts of revenge against members of Clark's regime. She asked that people \\"listen to the better angels of their nature.\\" Luchenko said that the courts and legal system would investigate and prosecute those who committed crimes during Clark's presidency. When it was learned that the Drakh were preparing to destroy Earth, Captain Elizabeth Lochley of Babylon 5 convinced Luchenko to send a large fleet to confront the Drakh. Even though the Shadow planet killer the Drakh brought to destroy Earth was itself destroyed, the Drakh were able to successfully seed Earth's atmosphere with biological weapons. The weapons would kill every living thing on Earth in five years. Sheridan offered his support, and the full resources of the Interstellar Alliance to help combat the Drakh plague. At some point within the next few years the Excalibur was able to find a cure for the plague. Her only appearance is in the fourth season episode \\"Rising Star\\", although her name is mentioned in a number of fifth season episodes. =Benjamin Kyle= Doctor Benjamin Kyle was portrayed by Johnny Sekka. His only appearance was in the Babylon 5 pilot movie The Gathering. Kyle was a xenobiologist who was chosen by Commander Jeffrey Sinclair for assignment to Babylon 5 in 2257. He was given responsibility for Babylon 5 medical department and labs. He was aboard the station when an assassination attempt was made on Ambassador Kosh. Kyle was one of very few humans to see a Vorlon first hand when he was forced to open the encounter suit of Ambassador Kosh, while working to save the Vorlon dignitary's life. Kyle was subsequently reassigned to Earth by the Earth Alliance President to work as an expert on alien physiology. Dr. Stephen Franklin was assigned to Babylon 5 to assume the medical duties. He eventually assumed the position of head of Xenobiological Research at EarthDome. When he retired in 2262, he was again replaced by Dr. Stephen Franklin. =Lou Welch= Lou Welch (David L. Crowley) is a member of the station's security force. He served for several years on board Babylon 5, and was one of Michael Garibaldi's close friends. His first appearance was in the first season episode \\"Survivors.\\" He appears in several early Babylon 5 episodes, until his last on-screen appearance in the second season episode \\"Gropos.\\" (This is approximately the same time that the character of Zack Allan was introduced into the show.) Reintroduced in the novels, Lou Welch later dies on Centauri Prime when he is murdered by the Prime Candidates and the Drakh after being caught using a changeling net to gather information on Vir Cotto's behalf. = Luis Santiago = President Luis Santiago (still photo of Douglas Netter) was President of the Earth Alliance at the beginning of the series. His openness to peaceful relationships with alien races contrasts with that of Vice President Clark, who hid his xenophobic views until he became president after Santiago's assassination in 2259. When Santiago was elected no one had doubts as to his Genevan expertise as he had already served as Vice President under President Elizabeth Levy during the tumultuous Earth-Minbari War. After serving at least one term, Santiago was re-elected in 2258, defeating challenger Marie Crane. Santiago had strong policies on opening trade relations and discussions with alien races and fully supported the efforts of the space station Babylon 5\\\\. While some saw this as a good thing, Vice- President Clark secretly opposed this viewpoint and once he was in power began a propaganda war to increase xenophobic views of the Earth Alliance. Susan Ivanova comments during his reelection campaign that she does not intend to vote for Santiago because she believes a leader should have a strong chin, which Santiago lacks. He was approximately one year into his second term at the time of his assassination aboard EarthForce One, the Babylon 5 equivalent of Air Force One, at the beginning of 2259. The incident occurs near the jump point off Io, one of Jupiter's moons. An energy problem with EarthForce One's jump engines is registered and the craft explodes live on ISN (the CNN of Babylon 5's universe). A slight suspicion of foul play is hinted at by the ISN feed. The newscaster comments that the president is late making his New Years speech moments before the incident. Whether this is because an incident has already occurred on EarthForce One, with the explosion of the craft to cover any evidence, is unknown though it is later discovered Clark arranged the incident with help from The Shadows. Psi Corps The Psi Corps is an agency of the Earth Alliance responsible for all humans with telepathic or other para-psychological abilities anywhere within Earth-controlled space. All persons with Psi abilities are required to either join the Corps, face lifetime imprisonment, or submit to a lifetime of drug treatments to suppress their abilities. Prolonged treatment with these drugs has a depressing effect. Psi Cops are members of a para-military body enforcing laws related to telepaths and operates with few checks against their authority. The Corps was originally established to protect, nurture and train humans with Psi abilities, and to protect the mundane population from possible abuse or criminal activities by talented individuals. The Psi Corps' headquarters has hospitals, offices and a boarding school where young people possessing telepathic and telekinetic power (known colloquially in the series as teeps and teeks) can develop without the fear and persecution they would face among the normal population (referred to by psychics in the series as mundanes). At some point the Corps realized that it could not be controlled by any external authority, and the Corps developed into a fascist state-within-a-state, pursuing its own agenda using the Psi Cops and other means, and taking an active role in Earth politics. By the time of the pilot movie, Babylon 5: The Gathering, the Corps has degenerated to the point where many potential and former members prefer a life on-the-run as rogue psychics (referred to by the Corps as blips) to the safety and comfort of living and working under its wing. After the colony on Babylon 5 was forced to leave, Lyta Alexander began a crusade against the Psi Corps. Her actions led to a war in which rogue telepaths and non-telepaths fought the Psi Corps. The old Psi Corps was destroyed, and a new Psionic Monitoring Commission was built to replace it. Once the Telepath War was over, the Psionic Monitoring Commission dedicated itself to hunting down those members of the Corps who committed war crimes, such as Alfred Bester. Bester was eventually captured and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison with his abilities taken away by drugs. Many private schools were founded to educate telepaths; they met with mixed success. Telepaths were allowed a much wider range of options as far as their lives were concerned. Rather than having to join the Psi Corps, they were able to do almost anything they wanted. This included joining the Earth Alliance military and working for private organizations. =Alfred Bester= Alfred Bester was played by Walter Koenig. He is a senior Psi Cop and a recurring antagonist in the series. J. Michael Straczynski named the character after the science fiction writer Alfred Bester, since telepathy is a recurring theme in his work (most notably The Demolished Man, which partly may have inspired the Psi corps and the \\"death of personality\\" legal punishment in the Babylon 5 universe). When Bester first appeared in the Babylon 5 series, he was in pursuit of a powerful telepath named Jason Ironheart, who had been the victim of illegal genetic and drug experiments by the Psi Corps in an attempt to create a powerful supertelepath, a P20 or beyond. Bester didn't get along with the command staff, a point which continually occurred throughout the series. Bester eventually agreed to work with Captain John Sheridan at several points during the Shadow War particularly after the Shadows captured someone very close to Bester. However, after Michael Garibaldi was captured during an attack by the Shadows on the station, Bester was able to secretly recover and capture him in turn. Bester had become aware of an anti-telepath conspiracy, and decided to try to use Garibaldi to expose it. Bester subjected him to subtle reprogramming in order to use him as a sleeper agent. He exploited Garibaldi's inherent traits of paranoia and distrust of authority, correctly believing that the conspiracy would view Garibaldi as a prime recruit once alienated from his friends and work. The wealthy industrialist William Edgars, the plot's mastermind, believed that a civil war among humanity would be counterproductive no matter how totalitarian the current regime. Edgars insisted that Garibaldi draw out Sheridan before he would bring Garibaldi fully into his confidence. Garibaldi, not suspecting why he was so driven to find out the innermost secrets of the plot, betrayed Sheridan to agents of the corrupt President Clark. Edgars then revealed that his pharmaceutical company, Edgars Industries, had perfected a lethal virus which would attack telepaths' unique genes. Any infected telepath would quickly die without regular doses of the antidote they had also created. This would reduce telepaths to a slave race and avert the war which many normals and telepaths believed loomed on the horizon. After learning this, Garibaldi entered a fugue state, and alerted Bester and the Psi Corps. Bester came to Garibaldi, still locked in his robotic paralysis, and revealed the details of the brainwashing and the deception. Although tempted to kill Garibaldi, Bester instead removed the commands and left Garibaldi to cope with the realization that he had betrayed everyone he knew on all sides. The Corps murdered William Edgars and captured the only known samples of both the virus and antidote. It was later revealed that, even with the programming removed, Bester had left in place an 'Asimov', a type of mental block - adapted from the first of Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics (Bester stated that it had been adapted from the first two of Asimov's laws, but his explanation only covered the first law) - knowing that Garibaldi would likely murder him on sight if not prevented from doing so. Lyta Alexander eventually agreed to remove the block from Garibaldi's mind, once he had helped her destroy the Psi Corps. Following the Telepath War, Alfred Bester was wanted for war crimes that he committed. He was planned to appear in the Crusade episode \\"Value Judgments\\", written by Fiona Avery, on the run from the authorities and being sought by Garibaldi's agents. The episode would have shown him encountering the crew of the Excalibur, who require a powerful telepath to open a lock that responds to powerful telepathy. The episode would have ended with him escaping once again. After the TV series, he spent several years on the run before moving to Paris, France, where he fell in love with a local businesswoman named Louise. But Michael Garibaldi was relentless in his pursuit, and eventually tracked him down. Bester was brought before the war crimes tribunal, and was tried in France for his crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison and subjected to the Sleeper drugs that deprived him of his telepathic abilities. During that time, a statue was even made of the lost child of Fiona. He then spent the next 10 years in a maximum-security prison, and died shortly after the death of John Sheridan in 2281. The very day before his death, he finally accepted that he was indeed the 'lost child' of Matthew and Fiona Dexter, and his left fist finally reopened as a result. Even in death, Garibaldi pursued him. After Bester's funeral, Garibaldi went to the gravesite and hammered a wooden stake into the ground above Bester's coffin. This quite amused a departing watcher, who was fully aware of what Bester had done and been in life.Keyes, J. Gregory, Babylon 5: Final Reckoning - The Fate of Bester, Del Rey Books, 1999 =Jason Ironheart= Jason Ironheart appeared in the first season episode \\"Mind War\\". Ironheart is a former lover of Talia Winters when they were in the Psi Corps together. He volunteered for experimental treatments to enhance his telepathy, and to produce stable telekinetics. The experiments succeeded, but caused Ironheart's powers to increase to an uncontrollable level. He fled from Psi Corps to Babylon 5 where he set up an escape route for other rogue telepaths, but was pursued by Bester. Ironheart began to undergo destructive \\"mindquakes\\", releasing bursts of psychokinetic energy so powerful they threatened the station. As Ironheart realized that his abilities had grown too great to contain, he discorporated his physical form, but not before leaving Talia with a gift; enhanced telepathic shields, and even a bit of telekinesis of her own. He then turns to Sinclair and says, \\"Goodbye Commander. I will see you again, in a million years.\\" (This is a reference to the final episode of the fourth season.) =Byron Gordon= Byron Gordon was played by Robin Atkin Downes. He was introduced in the season 5 episode \\"No Compromises\\" as a strong telepath (P12 rating). Byron is shown arriving on the Babylon 5 station with a large contingent of rogue telepaths early in the year 2262. At this stage Byron is portrayed as a Gandhi-like figure; a leader of telepaths who seeks freedom from the Psi Corps and from mundanes, but that will only do so through passive resistance/physically non-violent means, though he does show himself to be mentally violent, using intimidation and blackmail against members of the alliance. In \\"The Paragon of Animals\\", Byron helps the new Interstellar Alliance by revealing treachery by the Drazi against the Enphili. John Sheridan offers Byron and his telepaths political asylum at Babylon 5. They are allowed to establish a small colony in Brown 3. In his early appearances in Season 5, Byron is shown as trying to maintain distance from conflict between his telepaths and the aggressive mundanes from \\"Down Below\\", the Psi Corps, and from being used as tools by the Interstellar Alliance. Key disputes come between Byron and Michael Garibaldi over his wish to employ Byron's telepaths as spies (\\"The Paragon of Animals\\" (episode 3)), and between the telepaths and the Earth Force/Psi Corps over their rogue status (\\"Strange Relations\\" (episode 6)). Ultimately, Byron agrees for two of his people to serve the Alliance, and Elizabeth Lochley negotiates for the telepaths to remain temporarily on the station. It is later revealed in \\"Secrets of the Soul\\" (episode 7) that Byron had trained with the Psi Corps. In fact, he had interned with the Psi Cops and was the prot√©g√© of the famous/infamous Alfred Bester. This later episode also revealed that he was part of Bester's elite Black Omega squadron, and had deserted after receiving orders to fire upon defenseless mundanes (non-telepaths). The Psi Corps Trilogy books by Gregory Keyes expand on this apparent crisis of conscience a little. Byron and his ship appear to have crashed or been lost around Venus, but this turns out to be a ruse to effect his desertion without raising suspicions. A second major shift in Byron's outlook occurs in as the result of a romantic relationship with telepath Lyta Alexander that evolves over several episodes of the television series. Lyta and Byron find comfort and acceptance in each other, however intimate moments (\\"Secrets of the Soul\\" (episode 7)) eventually unlock secrets of the Vorlons hidden deep within Lyta's mind. It is revealed to Byron that the Vorlons had generated telepaths as weapons in their war against the Shadows. Byron is shown as angered by this. As the Vorlons are no longer around to be blamed, he decides that the remaining races who had been \\"saved\\" by telepaths owe him and his people a new homeland. Furthermore, from comments of his in \\"The Paragon of Animals\\" and other episodes, it is clear that in his own way, he despises mundanes just as much as Bester does. In \\"In the Kingdom of the Blind\\" (episode 9), Byron threatens the members of the Interstellar Alliance with the revelation of their deepest secrets. The aim of this exercise is increased leverage to further his and his followers' goal of a new telepath homeworld. However, Byron's mental intimidation merely caused conflicts to rapidly escalate, and the Psi Corps is called in to arrest Byron and his followers. While many remained with Byron in a starvation protest sealed in their colony, a group of renegades take a more aggressive stance attacking station personnel and seizing hostages. Amongst the hostages are Garibaldi and Dr Franklin. In a story arc carried over several episodes (\\"A Tragedy of Telepaths\\" (episode 10)-\\"Phoenix Rising\\" (episode 11)) Byron is portrayed as distraught over killing in his name; this is not how he wanted the battle to be fought. With the aid of Lyta Alexander, he is able to free the hostages and kill the leader of the renegade telepaths. He surrenders under the condition that those who did not take part in the violence would be freed; the renegades and himself would turn themselves in to station security. While these terms are agreed to by Sheridan, the appearance of Alfred Bester during the surrender precipitates a shooting battle, during which many telepaths and security members are killed. Byron, not wanting to return to Psi Corps, fires into a chemical leak, causing an explosion and turning himself and the other renegades into martyrs. In the aftermath shown at the end of \\"Phoenix Rising\\", Lyta Alexander takes over Byron's mission for a telepath homeland or homeworld, and she becomes the leader of the telepath resistance. The actions of Byron's more aggressive followers along with Alfred Bester's own violence against them arguably form the opening moves of the Telepath War. Miscellaneous humans =William Edgars= William Edgars (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) is the founder and CEO of Edgars Industries, the fourth-largest Earth megacorporation and largest pharmaceutical research company on Mars. One of the richest men in the Earth Alliance, Edgars was a powerful member of the plutocracy that held great influence over EarthGov policy. With this influence threatened by President Clark's regime and its empowerment of the Psi Corps, Edgars conspired to gain a means of control over telepaths, and to ultimately neutralize them if necessary. He acquired a leftover Shadow-tech biological weapon through the black market, and developed it into a virus that infects telepaths, killing them unless they regularly take an antidote also produced by Edgars Industries. This plot was foiled and Edgars was murdered by the Psi Corps after the conspiracy was discovered by Michael Garibaldi, acting as an unwilling infiltration agent. William Edgars is survived by his wife, Lise Hampton, who is the sole known inheritor of his estate. =Lise Hampton= Lise Hampton (Denise Gentile) is Michael Garibaldi's love interest. She appears in seasons one through five. She is also known as Lise Hampton-Edgars and Lise Hampton-Edgars-Garibaldi. She first appears in part two of \\"A Voice in the Wilderness\\". Lise Hampton first met Garibaldi when he was stationed on Mars during the Earth-Minbari War; the pair began an on/off relationship that lasted until Garibaldi accepted the post of Chief of Security aboard Babylon 5. During the Mars Rebellion, Garibaldi becomes concerned about Lise's safety, and learns she has been injured during a riot; Garibaldi is heartbroken when he finds out Lise has married a man named Franz. Lise and Franz later divorce, and Lise marries wealthy industrialist William Edgars, founder and owner of Edgars Industries. When Edgars is murdered by Psi Corps, Lise inherits Edgars Industries, but goes on the run and turns to the Martian underworld for protection; the criminals take Lise hostage for ransom instead. Garibaldi and a group of Rangers rescue Lise. After the end of the Earth Alliance Civil War, Lise and Garibaldi are married and take joint ownership of Edgars Industries. A rogue faction of Edgars Industries executives hire an assassin to kill Lise and Garibaldi, but Garibaldi learns who is responsible and takes revenge. In the series finale, \\"Sleeping in Light\\", Garibaldi and Lise are still happily married and have a teenage daughter named Mary. =Brother Theo= Brother Theo is the leader of a group of Roman Catholic monks living on Babylon 5, who appear in a few episodes of season three. Brother Theo and his order of Cistercian Trappist monks (from New Melleray Abbey) first come to the station in the episode \\"Convictions\\". The group of monks wish to learn more about the varied aliens and their beliefs, and support that work by offering their services as computer experts and engineers. With permission from Church officials and the Babylon 5 command staff, they take up residence in the station. Brother Theo and his monks quickly prove their value when they help review security camera footage to catch a bomber who terrorized residents on the station. Next, Brother Theo appears in the episode \\"Passing Through Gethsemane\\", when he manages to soundly beat John Sheridan in a game of chess. Sheridan is introduced to Brother Edward (Brad Dourif) during the course of the game. Soon, Theo becomes concerned about Brother Edward when the monk begins reporting hearing voices and having flashbacks. Theo, not knowing too much about Edward's past, asks Sheridan and Garibaldi to look into his past. But at the same time Theo is doing the same, and before too long it is learned that Edward was actually the \\"Black Rose Killer,\\" a serial killer who preyed on women. After being convicted of the crimes, Edward had his mind wiped, and after being presumed dead in a fire had come to the Order with a new personality designed to want to serve society. The families of the victims of the \\"Black Rose Killer\\" are not satisfied, and want revenge. Using a Centauri telepath and the intercom system, they manage to break down the memory blocks, and one of the family members mortally wounds Edward. Before dying, Brother Edward is granted absolution by Brother Theo. After the trial and conviction of Brother Edward's killer, Theo takes the newly-mind-wiped man into the order as Brother Malcolm, having forgiven him for killing Edward. Brother Theo's final appearance was in the episode \\"And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place\\". After the station broke away from the Earth Alliance the monks remained on Babylon 5. Brother Theo had helped set up an intelligence network with other religious leaders, and helped bring several of them to Babylon 5 (under the pretext of a conference) to help smuggle this intelligence to the station's command staff. =Anna Sheridan= Anna Sheridan (Melissa Gilbert) was John Sheridan's wife. She served as a crew member aboard the Icarus, an Interplanetary Expeditions ship that set down on Z'ha'dum approximately two years before John Sheridan's assignment to Babylon 5. The Icarus and all hands were believed lost at some point during the expedition. In fact, the crew came into contact with the awakening Shadows and at least some crew were \\"changed\\" to suit the Shadows' needs. John Sheridan had lived with guilt over his wife's death as he believed himself partly responsible for her accepting a position on the Icarus. In 2260, Anna (or her body under Shadow control), who had up until that point been used as the living control center of a Shadow vessel, was sent by the Shadows to Babylon 5 to lure John Sheridan to Z'ha'dum. Both traveled there in the White Star. Anna dies (again) at Z'ha'dum when John Sheridan remotely activated the White Star, causing it to fall toward the Shadow compound, and then detonating two high-yield nuclear weapons (500 megatons each) on board the ship. =David Sheridan= David Sheridan was the son of the Interstellar Alliance President John Sheridan and his wife Delenn. Sheridan was named after his paternal grandfather David Sheridan. He did not appear in any of the Babylon 5 television episodes or made-for-television movies, but was featured in Out of the Darkness, the third novel in the canon Legions of Fire novel series. His existence was first established in the two- part \\"War Without End\\" episode from the third season of Babylon 5 when his father traveled forward in time briefly and was told by Delenn that they had a son. This foreshadowing served to alter the tone of the relationship between Sheridan and Delenn, which was at that point still developing. It also served as part of the motivation for Sheridan's actions at the end of the third season, which in turn resolved many of the major plotlines thus far in the show. The final episode of season four, \\"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars\\" contains a reference to an incident involving David, in a segment set one hundred years later, but does not detail the nature of this. Towards the end of the fifth and final season of Babylon 5, Delenn finally became pregnant with him. His birth takes place off-camera between the penultimate episode, \\"Objects at Rest\\", and the final episode, \\"Sleeping in Light\\", set some 19 years later. In \\"Sleeping in Light\\", we learn that David was in training with the Rangers at the time of his father's death. That was after the resolution of the trap set for him and his parents by the Drakh, who used Mollari as their unwilling agent. According to the DVD commentary for the final episode of Babylon 5, \\"Sleeping in Light,\\" Straczynski decided not to have David Sheridan appear in that episode, partly because he hadn't figured out how he wanted David to look, and partly because he feared that debuting an important character would detract from the story he wanted to tell in that episode. David Sheridan finally appeared in the Peter David novel Out of the Darkness as a main character, where he brings his story full circle by, under the control of the evil Drakh, luring his parents to Centauri Prime, thus creating the situation that his father stumbled into in \\"War Without End\\", and explaining the reference in \\"Deconstruction of Falling Stars\\". David is saved when the Drakh controlling him is killed, thus causing David's Keeper to wither and die. =Catherine Sakai= Catherine Sakai (Julia Nickson-Soul, credited as Julia Nickson) is the love interest of Commander Jeffrey Sinclair in the first-season episodes \\"The Parliament of Dreams\\", \\"Mind War\\" and \\"Chrysalis\\". The two have a long on-again, off-again relationship, though at the end of \\"Chrysalis\\" they announce their engagement. Sakai is an independent planet surveyor and operates the survey ship \\"Skydancer\\". G'Kar warns her against surveying Sigma 957, but she does not take his advice. She then becomes one of the first humans to come across the \\"First Ones\\", who make their home there. Her ship is damaged, and her death imminent, but she is rescued by a ship sent by G'Kar. =Morden= Morden was played by Ed Wasser. He is a recurring antagonist in the show and is arguably the face of the primary villains of the series during its first four seasons, as he often manipulates the series' other characters for the Shadows' sinister purposes. Morden serves as the spokesman on behalf of the Shadows, an ancient and incredibly powerful alien race whom he refers to as his \\"associates.\\" Although outwardly polite and gracious, he represents a dangerous hidden agenda. Any conversation is overheard by two or three cloaked Shadows, who accompany him at all times and work through him as seen both in the television series and in the novel Babylon 5: The Passing of the Techno-Mages - Invoking Darkness. Indoctrinated by the Shadows after his capture during an expedition to Z'ha'dum, the Shadows' homeworld, he has accepted to serve because of the Shadows' manipulation of his guilt of the death of his wife and child and because they promise to save his family who he believed were trapped in hyperspace. When pushed, Morden drops any pretense of friendliness, openly threatening anyone who presents any difficulty to his associates. Morden was killed and beheaded by Londo in 2261, during the efforts to expunge the Shadow influence from Centauri Prime. His head was placed upon a pike on the Centauri royal grounds, a gift from Londo to his aide, Vir Cotto, who mocks him in the exact manner he said he would, back when Morden had asked Vir what the latter wanted. He did, however, make a final appearance during the Brakiri holy day, the Day of the Dead, in 2262, in which the living are able to consult with apparitions of the dead. All the characters who answered the Shadow Question got exactly what they asked for, although Vir was the only one who was satisfied with the results. =Number One= Number One was portrayed by Marjorie Monaghan. Throughout the series, she is only referred to as Number One, until the last few episodes of season 5. Before getting the role of Number One, Monaghan had auditioned for Babylon 5 once or twice before. The producers asked her to read for the part based on her work on Space Rangers, where she had also worked with Claudia Christian (Susan Ivanova on B5) years earlier. Monaghan found it \\"interesting to play characters about whom certain things are hidden\\", like her then undisclosed name. Number One first appears in the season 4 episode \\"Racing Mars as the leader of the resistance movement on Mars. The names Number One, Number Two, etc. were used on Mars by the resistance to protect the identity of its leaders. Once there, Franklin manages to convince her to stop her fellow members from attacking civilian targets. She later becomes head of covert intelligence for the Interstellar Alliance. As she comes aboard the station in the episode \\"Objects in Motion\\", she experiences problems with her identicard and identifies herself as Tessa Holloran. After that Garibaldi, Franklin, and later Sheridan refer to her as Tessa and no longer as Number One. She remains on board the station in her new role, upon Sheridan's recommendation that she would have access to more resources at Babylon 5 rather than being on Minbar. Minbari  The Minbari are an advanced race, who are a galactic superpower just like the Earth-Alliance. Their homeworld is the planet Minbar. Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski named the planet and race after the Islamic pulpit known as a minbar. They were one of the military forces of the younger races in the previous Shadow War (the Vorlons being the main force) which took place roughly in the Earth year 1260 A.D. The Minbari were completely defeated by the Shadows in this first war and on the verge of total extinction but were saved by the Earth Babylon 4 station. The Minbari Federation is a caste society, its people divided into worker, warrior, and religious castes. The Minbari are led by the Grey Council, which contains nine representatives, originally three from each of the three castes. The council was disbanded by Ambassador Delenn as part of an effort to fight the Shadows. She later reorganized it, giving the Worker Caste (which had previously been caught in the middle of the power struggle between the Warrior and Religious castes) a substantial increase of power and influence. Minbari are humanoid, usually thin and pale, though considerably stronger in hand-to-hand combat than the average human of the same size; they are bald, with gray bony crests across the back of their heads. The first encounter between Minbari and Humans was a disaster - a misunderstanding led to Earth ships firing on Minbari ships, killing their leader Dukhat and precipitating the Earth-Minbari War. Shortly before reaching Earth, the Minbari surrendered and retreated. At the time the official reason for this reprieve was unknown. The Minbari do not believe in any individual God or gods. They instead believe that the universe itself is sentient and that it \\"broke itself into pieces to study every aspect of its being\\" as is stated in many episodes through the entire series. They use base- eleven mathematics\\"The Quality of Mercy\\", Babylon 5, orig. airdate 17 August 1994 and believe the number \\"3\\" to be sacred. =Branmer= Branmer is a deceased General (Shai Alit) who led the Minbari forces at the Battle of the Line. Branmer is not portrayed by an actor because his deceased body has been cremated. Branmer's father was a member of the Warrior Caste, his mother was from the Religious Caste. Because the mother's caste takes precedence in Minbari society, Branmer began life as a member of the religious caste. He was a close friend of Grey Council member Delenn. When the Earth-Minbari War began, Branmer became a General of the warrior caste. Branmer felt it was his religious duty to carry out the war against the humans. When the Grey Council ended the war, Branmer obeyed the order to stand down. In 2257, Branmer was on a diplomatic mission when he suddenly died. He had previously told Delenn that he had wished for a simple funeral followed by cremation. However, the clan he belonged to - the Star Riders - decided to take him on a lengthy journey home, which was seen as a most unusual move. The ship carrying Branmer's body soon arrived at Babylon 5. After lying in state over night, Branmer's first officer Neroon, followed by Delenn and the station's command staff, arrived at the place where Branmer's body was held. When Neroon opened the casket, Branmer's body was gone. It is discovered that Delenn had stolen the body and had Branmer cremated. She was going to explain his disappearance as a religious mystery, that his body had been physically taken away by the \\"Gods\\". This actually was an inconsistency in the plot, both earlier (\\"Believers\\") and later episodes had said that the Minbari did not believe in specific religious deities. (These events take place during the episode \\"Legacies\\".) =Draal= Draal was played first by Louis Turenne and later by John Schuck. In his first appearance in A Voice in the Wilderness, Draal was played by Louis Turenne. Feeling that he had no place in modern Minbari society, he set out to visit his former student Delenn on Babylon 5 one final time before leaving to go \\"to the sea.\\" During his visitation, the planet Epsilon III was experiencing geological instability, which threatened the orbital trajectory of the space station. It was discovered shortly thereafter that the planet housed a massive, globe-spanning mechanical system called the Great Machine, which was failing due to the terminal health of its supervisor, a lone alien named Varn. Because the Great Machine required a sentient mind to function as its central operating system, Varn's declining health was causing systematic failures that threatened the planet's integrity. Draal, reinvigorated by a sense of purpose and the opportunity to assist others in a way he no longer could on Minbar, gladly and willingly offered to take Varn's place as the custodian of the Great Machine. He then utilized the planet's defenses to destroy the violent separatists of Varn's species who had returned to take back its weapon systems. Once in place, Draal's presence restored the planet to a stable condition and warned all of Babylon 5 station personnel to refrain from landing on the surface; he intended to preserve Varn's mission to protect the advanced technology from misuse, and thus, barred anyone from journeying to the planet until they were ready. Draal indicated that the machine had a role to fill in some future event, and that he would come to them when ready. The next year, Draal appeared to Captain John Sheridan and put the Great Machine at the disposal of Sheridan and his allies in the fight against the Shadows. Louis Turenne was unable to reprise the role of Draal, so John Schuck was selected to play the role of Draal. The difference in appearance between the two men was explained by having the Great Machine restore Draal's health and appearance, making him appear 30 years younger. In the meantime Draal had discovered that he was not alone on the planet, that there were others there who helped take care of the Great Machine, one of them a being named Zathras. Draal would appear again in the episode Voices of Authority, again played by Schuck. This time he helped the crew of Babylon 5 make contact with an ancient race considered to be one of the First Ones. While interfaced with Draal's computer, Susan Ivanova found the evidence in the Great Machine that President Morgan Clark had indeed orchestrated the assassination of President Luis Santiago. After this appearance, Draal was mentioned from time to time in other episodes, but made no further appearances in the series. Schuck became unavailable due to commitments to a play, and producers did not want to cast a third actor for the role. J. Michael Straczynski has stated that he had other plans for the character, including an appearance in the first part of War Without End. When Babylon 5 declared independence from the Earth Alliance in the episode Severed Dreams, the crew used Draal's holographic systems to allow Sheridan to broadcast the declaration to residents and crew on board the station. Ivanova asked Sheridan if they should seek Draal's help in defending the station. Sheridan said it was their fight, not his, and that he wanted to keep Draal's alliance with the station a secret as long as possible. Later that year Draal used the Great Machine to expand the temporal rift in sector 14, where the Babylon 4 station had been. Doing so allowed John Sheridan and Jeffrey Sinclair to take the White Star back in time, and ensure that Babylon 4 entered the temporal rift and wound up 1,000 years in the past as was its destiny. Sinclair rode the station into the past, and became the Minbari leader Valen. Once Sheridan and the White Star arrived back in the present, Draal closed the rift so that no one else would become trapped in there. After the Vorlons and the Shadows left the galaxy, President Morgan Clark began a propaganda war against Babylon 5 and its crew. In order to counter this propaganda, Sheridan and Ivanova decided to broadcast their own reports on the atrocities of the Clark regime from the station's War Room. Because of the great distance from Babylon 5 to Earth, Ivanova enlists the assistance of Draal and the Great Machine to provide the massive power needed to enhance the broadcast signal across the divide. =Dukhat= Dukhat was portrayed by Reiner Sch√∂ne. He was first mentioned in the episode \\"Soul Hunter\\". His only appearances were in the movie In the Beginning and in the episode \\"Atonement\\" as flashbacks. Dukhat was the leader of the Minbari Grey Council when he was first introduced in the film In the Beginning. The Minbari considered him one of their greatest leaders, second only to the legendary Valen. In The Beginning reveals Dukhat as Delenn's mentor, and her eventual sponsor into the Grey Council, even though Dukhat belonged to the Warrior Caste and Delenn to the Religious Caste. Dukhat's administration of the Council was marked by growing fears of the reemergence of the ancient enemy of the Minbari, The Shadows. Many in the Gray Council refused to consider the possibility of the Shadows' return. In defiance, Dukhat ordered that the Council travel directly to the planet Z'ha'dum to investigate the rumors more closely. It was on this voyage that the Minbari first encountered humans. This first contact ended disastrously for both sides. The Minbari Warrior Caste soldiers who crewed the Council's flagship approached the Earth fleet with open gunports, a traditional gesture of respect. Realizing that humans would have no knowledge of this tradition, Dukhat ordered the gunports closed, but it was too late. Since the Earth ships could not jump away (due to an accidental side effect of the powerful Minbari scanners, which prevented Earth jump engines from working) and the human fleet commander was known to handle first contact situations rather badly, the humans believed that the Minbari were about to attack; they misinterpreted the Minbari gesture and opened fire. Dukhat was killed in the exchange, his death witnessed only by a grieving Delenn, whom Dukhat had trained. Delenn swore vengeance against the humans who had killed her master, and cast the deciding Council vote that began the Earth-Minbari War. In The Beginning also revealed that Dukhat had secret Vorlon advisors when Vorlons had not openly contacted the Minbari for a long time. =Neroon= Neroon is a portrayed by John Vickery. He was a recurring guest character throughout the series. Neroon was a member of the Minbari Warrior Caste from the Star Riders clan. During the storied Earth-Minbari War, Neroon fought against the humans and eventually became Alit (second in command) of a Minbari warship under the command of Shai Alit Branmer, a Minbari of mixed Religious- and Warrior-caste parentage, who was so incensed by what he perceived as the humans' unprovoked murder of Dukhat, the leader of the Grey Council, that he defied tradition and took up his father's caste, the Warrior caste. Neroon came to idolise Branmer but developed a distinct hatred and distrust of both humans and the Religious Caste. After Branmer's death, Neroon accompanied his body on a tour of Minbari-occupied space (in defiance of Branmer's final wishes to have a simple cremation ceremony and scattering his ashes in space over Minbar), and was ready to start the war again when the body suddenly went missing (Legacies). After the transformation of Delenn in 2259, he replaced her on the Grey Council, creating for the first time an imbalance of power between the castes. He was not impressed by the revelation of the Grey Council's secret and was angry at the years their leaders had been concealing the truth about the end of the war from the Minbari people. He blamed, or appeared to blame, the religious caste for this at that time, referring somewhat later to \\"the usual fanaticism we've come to expect from the religious caste\\". It took Delenn's honesty and willingness for self- sacrifice for the good of their people, and the revelation of the corruption rampant amongst his own caste's leadership, to make him change his mind (All Alone in the Night). At the climax of the Minbari Civil war, Delenn challenged the leader of the warrior caste to stand in the Starfire wheel, a dangerous energy field and a symbol of leadership. The head of the warrior caste ultimately surrendered and left the circle, but Delenn stayed, intending for the death of a religious caste member to end the war. Moved by her bravery, Neroon took her place in the wheel. Declaring that in his heart, he was always a member of the religious caste, he died and ended the war (Moments of Transition). Neroon was a complex character, a person of principle and courage who was deeply affected by his war service, a person of deep loyalties who was nonetheless eventually capable of seeing beyond these, who came to realize that the greatest courage is to admit when one is wrong, and to do whatever is necessary to make up for it, no matter the personal cost. When Delenn then restored the Grey Council, she held the leadership position of the Council open, stating: 'This place is reserved in memory of Neroon, until the day it is taken by the one who is to come'. Centauri  The Centauri Republic, once a mighty empire, has grown decadent and is in a slow decline. Their homeworld is Centauri Prime, a small Earth-like planet consisting of two large continents and several smaller islands divided by large oceans of water. The planet has a population of about 3.4 billion. The Centauri, a humanoid race similar in appearance to humans, are a proud and aristocratic people governed by an emperor and a nobility-driven senate called the Centaurum. The Centauri were the first alien race to openly contact humanity. The Centauri initially tried to convince the humans that they were a long lost colony of the Republic. This ruse failed once human scientists got access to Centauri DNA, but Centauri-Human trade and contact led to tremendous technological advancement and humanity's eventual rise as a major power. For instance, it was the Centauri who sold jumpgate technology to the Earth Alliance, allowing humanity to start colonizing interstellar space. Centauri males of high social status typically wear their hair in Peacock-tail shaped fans, the length and style of which are determined by relative social class. Low-class Centauri males have not been seen without helmets. Centauri females mostly or entirely shave their heads. In this episode Centauri emperor Turhan specifically states that Centauri females shave their heads, and his wives are shown to be completely bald.The Centauri Republic Factbook (op. cit., p. 8), which is non- canonical, incorrectly reports that only Centauri males grow hair at all. The social significance (if any) of complete versus almost-complete baldness on a female is not specified outright; however, in the televised episodes, older females are shown completely bald, and younger (up to the apparent human age range of the 30s, and often but not always unmarried) with ponytails. In this episode, the unmarried Centauri female Adira Tyree is shown to have a ponytail. In this episode, the youngest of Mollari's three Centauri wives has a ponytail, while the elder two are completely bald. In this episode, Vir Cotto's fianc√©e Lyndisty is shown to have a ponytail. The cardio-vascular system of Centauri includes two hearts instead of the single heart that humans have. The right heart is a solid mass of muscle which provides most of the force behind the body's blood circulation. The left heart is much more complex - this heart is made up of an intricate system of thousands of veins that help cleanse the blood in a manner similar to the human kidneys. The sexual organs of the Centauri are in a different location than the human sex organs. Male Centauri have six tentacle-like genital organs that extend out from the sides of the body and \\"fold\\" in over the solar plexus when not in use. The males can stretch the tentacles out to four feet. A popular Centauri meal is a dish called spoo, which mostly serves as a running gag in the show. Spoo comes from an animal of the same name which is \\"regarded as [one of] the ugliest animals in the known galaxy by just about every sentient species capable of starflight\\" according to character Emerson Briggs-Wallacewith. The government of the Centauri Republic is, despite it being called a republic, ruled by an Emperor and an assembly of Ministers and heads of various Houses that form the Centaurum. The Centauri Republic is reflective of many imperial cultures on Earth, although J. Michael Straczynski makes a specific comparison: \\"the British Empire once upon a time... It was a great military power. But slowly, as can happen, they grew content, and lazy, and gradually their own empire began to slip between their fingers\\". =Emperor Cartagia= Emperor Cartagia was played by Wortham Krimmer. He is mentioned by name early in the series, but his first on-screen appearance is in the fourth season episode The Hour of the Wolf. Cartagia was the nephew of Emperor Turhan. When Cartagia was installed as emperor in 2259 by a group of Centauri politicians led by Lord Refa and Londo Mollari, he acted as, essentially, a powerless figurehead; however, he gradually amassed near-absolute power. The scale of his self- aggrandizement and madness were exposed in early 2261, near the end of the Shadow War, when he willingly brought Centauri Prime to the brink of annihilation by the Vorlons in an effort to secure his place among the gods. When Turhan died while on a visit to Babylon 5, he left no direct heirs (as his son had also died recently in an \\"accident\\"). It was expected that his Prime Minister, Malachi, would be the next Emperor but he was assassinated by forces loyal to Lord Refa. Several Centauri houses then vied for the throne but were unable to secure a binding claim, enabling Cartagia, with the backing of Refa's agents, to accede. Serving largely as a figurehead for Refa and his agents, Cartagia was in favor of the military expansion of the Centauri, including the conquest of the Narn, and this quickly translated into the Narn- Centauri conflict of 2259. After defeating the Narn in a series of quick strikes aided by the Shadows and illegal mass drivers, Cartagia's government undertook military campaigns against other races bordering Centauri space. In early 2261, Cartagia had Babylon 5 Ambassador Mollari recalled to Centauri Prime and appointed him as Minister of Internal Security. At first, Cartagia merely seemed flamboyant and self-indulgent, with his shocking lower-class hairstyle and numerous hangers-on. It did not take long for Mollari to realize that Cartagia was dangerously insane, especially after he learned from Morden that Cartagia had allowed the Shadows, reeling from the events on Z'ha'dum, to establish a base on the Centauri homeworld. Mollari expressed his concerns to a member of the royal court, who explained that though the Centarum had tried to oppose Cartagia, all of his opposition had since disappeared, with the rumor being that Cartagia had hidden their heads in a secret room, where he spoke with them on a regular basis. Mollari later discovered this rumor to be true; it was also around this time that Londo learned that the Vorlons were destroying any planet with even the slightest taint of Shadow influence. When Londo informed Cartagia of this, he explained that the Shadows had agreed to reward his assistance by turning him into a deity. Cartagia then explained that the Vorlons would help his plans for deification by turning Centauri Prime into a massive inauguration pyre. Londo knew that, in order to protect his planet and its people, he would have to kill Cartagia. During these events, G'Kar was captured and brought to Centauri Prime, initially presented by the Emperor as a gift to Londo. Cartagia proceeded to have G'Kar tortured prior to being executed, having him lashed with an electro-whip and even having an eye removed because he didn't like the way the Narn looked at him. Londo secretly visited G'Kar in his cell during all this and came to an agreement: in return for G'Kar's assistance in his plot to assassinate Cartagia, Londo would end the Centauri occupation of Narn. As part of this plot, Mollari convinced Cartagia to take G'Kar to Narn and execute him there, thus allowing Mollari to draw the Emperor away from the royal court, leaving him more vulnerable. When they arrived on Narn, Cartagia planned to have G'Kar killed in front of local Narns to break their spirit. Mollari had arranged for the chains on G'Kar's restraints to be weakened, to distract Cartagia long enough for Londo to act. They would then secretly inject a poison into the Emperor which would cause his cardiovascular system to shut down nearly instantly. The plan came close to failure when Cartagia had G'Kar's chains replaced after noting that they looked \\"weak.\\" Despite this, G'Kar managed to break free and began fighting with the guards. In the commotion Mollari escorted Cartagia away from the fight and prepared to inject the poison into him. Cartagia went into a fit of rage about how this was not part of his destiny and reacting to being told to quiet down by Mollari, turned and punched him, knocking the device away. Cartagia grabbed Mollari in a stranglehold, ranting about how Mollari deserved to burn with the rest of the Centauri for failing to see his greatness. As Cartagia turned to walk away, he was injected with the poison by Vir Cotto, who had picked up the device while Londo and Cartagia struggled. Cartagia grabbed Vir by the throat, but was immediately overcome, falling insensible as he moaned that his dream of becoming a god would never be realized. Shortly after this, the Imperial guards found Cartagia, supported by Mollari and Vir. Mollari explained that the Emperor had collapsed and that he believed the Emperor's hearts had failed. Mollari kept his promise to G'Kar, by explaining to the court that Centauri dealings with the Narn have resulted in the deaths of two Emperors and that Cartagia would interpret this as a sign from the gods to leave. In the following days, as the Army of Light planned for its final assault upon the Vorlons and the Shadows, Mollari systematically removed the Shadow influence from Centauri Prime. He dealt first with the Shadow vessels on Centauri Prime by destroying the island they were on and then had Mr. Morden beheaded. Following the death of Emperor Cartagia, the Centauri government decided not to name a new Emperor right away, hoping to prevent the possibility of another Cartagia assuming the throne. Indeed, a long-serving minister, Virini, remarked the royal bloodline was not what it once was due to inbreeding, commenting that, \\"...when you reduce a family tree to a family bush, you can't hide as much underneath.\\" The Centarum selected Virini as their Regent, until such time as a new Emperor was selected. =Milo Virini= Milo Virini was played by Damian London. A member of the Centauri race, Virini is a Minister of the Centauri Imperial Court and later appointed Centauri Regent. He is only named on screen once during the episode In the Kingdom of the Blind. As Minister, Virini often served as an intermediary in the Centauri Imperial Court, relating the Emperor's orders to his ambassadors early in the series. He was flamboyant in manner and practised strict sobriety, his only vice. He had served for a great many years in the court: he could remember Lord Jano as a small child being entertained by the Emperor Turhan; Londo Mollari had known him since his first visit to the royal court. In the early part of the fourth season, he cautions Londo not to speak out against Emperor Cartagia after the arrival of the Shadow fleet on Centauri Prime. He claims (correctly, as the audience later finds out) that Cartagia has a desk upon which he has the heads of former cabinet ministers who disagreed with him, arranged in a row. After the assassination of Cartagia in The Long Night, Prime Minister Mollari informs him that he has been appointed Regent to the throne until the Centaurum clearly determine how to fill the vacuum of power in Epiphanies. However, by the end of Epiphanies Virini came under the control of the Drakh, who sought revenge upon the Centauri Republic for their part in the Shadow War and plotted the destruction of Centauri Prime. By In the Kingdom of the Blind, Virini has become very reclusive, allowing only his personal physician and a few trusted aides access. He had been found wandering the palace at night talking furtively to himself, took to heavy drinking, and once ordered a guard to kill him, claiming that he was not himself. Routine documents such as status reports on the fleet and other reports were all reclassified 'Top Secret' for the Regent's eyes only, contrary to standard protocols. The Drakh controlled Virini with a keeper, a parasitic life form that bonded to his shoulder and bent him to the will of the Drakh. Virini ordered the Centauri fleet to launch covert raids upon the shipping lines of members of the Interstellar Alliance to create unrest and distrust within the union. Ultimately this led to the Centauri war at the end of the fifth season, where the Narn and the Drazi devastated Centauri Prime. In the episode, The Fall of Centauri Prime, the Regent introduces Mollari to a Drakh. The Drakh explains that they were servants of the Shadows and they want revenge by isolating the Centauri. If Londo will not agree to serve them, the Drakh threatens to detonate fusion bombs all over the planet killing millions. Londo agrees, and the keeper leaves the Regent who then dies in Londo's arms. =Emperor Turhan= Turhan is the Emperor of the Centauri Republic until his death in 2259. The name Turhan comes from the first name of the actor who portrayed him, Turhan Bey. Turhan succeeded his father as Emperor of the Centauri Republic. In 2257 Turhan appointed Londo Mollari to be the ambassador to Babylon 5. In \\"The Coming of Shadows\\", Turhan found that his health was declining, and before he died he decided that he wanted to apologize to the Narn people for all the wrongs his people had done to them. Against the advice of his ministers, he traveled to Babylon 5 in 2259 to deliver this apology in person to G'Kar. He asked his Prime Minister and close friend Malachi (also named for the actor who portrayed him--Malachi Throne) to remain behind on Centauri Prime during this time. Shortly after arriving on Babylon 5, Turhan suffers a debilitating heart attack. It becomes apparent that Turhan would soon die from his condition. When he announced that he wanted to see a Vorlon before he died, Kosh fulfills this wish. Turhan asks Kosh \\"How will all this end?\\", Kosh cryptically replies, \\"‚Ä¶in fire.\\" Meanwhile, Lord Refa and Londo Mollari have gotten the Shadows to stage an attack on a Narn outpost. Lord Refa also has Malachi assassinated to remove a potential challenger from power. When told of the attack, Turhan whispers his last words to Londo Mollari: \\"You are both damned.\\" Emperor Turhan had no living heirs of his own, his son having predeceased him. With Malachi dead, there was no clear successor to the throne. Following Turhan's death, a number of Centauri families made challenges for the throne. Turhan's nephew, a young man named Cartagia, assumes the throne after Turhan's death. =Dius Vintari= Dius Vintari is the son of the Centauri Emperor Cartagia, and is the third in the line of succession to the Centauri throne, directly behind Vir Cotto, the assassin of Cartagia. According to Galen, he will become the Emperor of the Centauri Republic in 2291, succeeding Vir. Galen had a vision of a future in which Vintari, after becoming Emperor, would wage war on Earth and kill billions. Galen approaches President Sheridan to make appeal, and have him prevent this future by killing Vintari. Sheridan considers it, but after meeting the young man, decides instead to take him under his wing and bring him to Minbar, raising him as a son. This way, Sheridan hopes to turn him away from the destructive path Galen warned about by showing him a peaceful and trusting way of life. Furthermore, Sheridan confronts Galen, who is seemingly upset at the thwarting of his plan, and all but makes him admit that the Technomage's actual plan was to manipulate Sheridan into making the moral decision he made. =Antono Refa= Lord Antono Refa is played by William Forward. He is a regular guest character in the second and third seasons. Refa appears on Babylon 5 shortly after the only son of Emperor Turhan dies, leaving a gap in the line of succession for the Centauri throne. On his first visit, Refa makes it clear to Londo that he speaks for a group of Centauri politicians who are interested in making a move for the throne after the death of Turhan, whose health is in rapid decline. In an attempt to restore his wounded pride and prestige, Londo naively allies himself with Mr. Morden for assistance in dealing with problematic Narn military outposts, unaware that he is the intermediary for The Shadows. When The Shadows successfully destroy all their assigned targets, Londo's mysterious association with a powerful military force earns him tremendous political advancement in the Centauri Republic. Refa sees him and his \\"associates\\" as the tools necessary to complete the transition of power; while he initially believes Londo to be a fellow sympathizer, Londo's escalating reservations about Refa's ruthlessness in the Centaurum lead Refa to consider disposing of him once he has outlived his usefulness. Later, this group stages a coup when the ailing Turhan pays a visit to Babylon 5. The purpose of this visit, as Turhan sees it, is to ask for forgiveness and peace from the Narn ambassador, G'Kar, for the great abuses the Centauri had done to the Narn. Unfortunately, Turhan collapses before he can make this offer in person to G'Kar, though his message is relayed to G'Kar through Dr. Franklin. With Turhan now dying and his message of peace not delivered in public view of the Centauri and Narn, Refa's men take this opportunity to strike, ordering the assassination of Turhan's prime minister on Centauri Prime, while Refa and Londo, on Babylon 5, are present at the death of the Emperor. At the same time, the Shadows attack a Narn colony on Londo's behalf, restarting the Narn-Centauri War. When Refa informs Turhan of his and Londo's work, the Emperor's dying words to Mollari are \\"You are both damned,\\" which Refa considers a rather small price for immortality. With his political enemies out of the way, Refa and his associates install the mad Emperor Cartagia to power, and begin a protracted war against the Narn. Using Londo's agreement with the Shadows forces, Refa personally oversees the war. As the Narn forces begin to falter, Refa devises a masterstroke: to reconquer the Narn homeworld in a single, massive attack. When he learns that the Narn have diverted the majority of their fleet to destroy a vital supply post on Gorash 7, he needles Londo into tasking his Shadow forces to destroy the fleet so that the Centauri forces have a clear line of attack on the Narn homeworld. The Shadows obliterate the Narn fleet at Gorash 7, and the Centauri fleet arrives at the Narn homeworld with mass drivers: large ships that utilize asteroids for planetary bombardment. Refa cordially drafts the reluctant Londo into attending the assault on an escort vessel; the experience traumatizes Londo and, coupled with Refa's violation of multiple weapons treaties, he becomes disenchanted with their alliance. After 4 days of bombardment, the Narn unconditionally surrender. Following the Second Conquest of Narn, Londo dissolves his partnership with Morden to prevent further escalation. Undeterred, Morden approaches and re-establishes his business relationship with Refa, much to Londo's dismay, especially considering Refa then encourages Emperor Cartargia to engage in a dozen simultaneous and pointless wars with various neighboring powers. In an effort to prevent Lord Refa from continuing his relationship with the Shadows and to encourage a more rational military situation, Londo poisons (or at least claims to) Refa's drink during a meeting on Babylon 5 with a binary poison. He informs Refa that the second, activating dose of the poison will be clandestinely administered unless he stops the needless military campaigns and terminates his relationship with Morden; it will also be administered if he attempts to betray him in the future. Angrily, Refa agrees. Again, Morden comes to Londo, this time quite angry that Londo would interfere in his associates' activities in this way. However, Londo really wants nothing more to do with Morden, so when Londo gives him the brush off, Morden arranges for Londo to care again, by setting up the murder of Londo's true love, Adira. However, Morden takes this further, by poisoning her with a poison of Centauri origin, allowing Morden to convince Londo to place the blame on Lord Refa, whom Londo already knows is still upset about being \\"poisoned.\\" This, again, places Londo in association with Morden. Finally, though, Londo resolves to do something about Lord Refa, who has himself been inciting a feud between their two houses on Centauri Prime. In an elaborate plot staged to maximize Londo's political gain, Refa is lured to the Narn homeworld in expectations of capturing G'Kar, who is on Narn ostensibly looking for his old assistant, Na'Toth. However, the actual plan is to capture Refa, who was responsible for the decision to use mass drivers on Narn, and turn him over to G'Kar and his Narn associates, who, in addition to having several Narn prisoners released from Centauri custody to ensure their cooperation, were allowed by Londo to kill this Centauri without retaliation. Two of the reasons Londo has Refa killed are personal: the death of Adira Tyree (which, in fact, Refa was not involved with as the true culprit was Mr. Morden) and the murder of Prime Minister Malachi (which Refa committed to ensure the enthronement of Cartagia). In the end, with orders from G'Kar to leave the Centauri's head unmarked for identification, Lord Refa is chased down by G'Kar's Narn associates and beaten to death. On Babylon 5, Londo presents evidence of Refa's \\"betrayal\\" of the Centauri to the visiting Centauri minister, gaining prestige in the royal court and ridding himself of Lord Refa. Footage of Refa's death at the Narn's hands is intercut with a Baptist prayer service on Babylon 5, which includes a hymn called \\"There's No Hiding Place Down here\\"‚Äîabout the inevitability of the punishment of a fleeing sinner. William Forward asked J. Michael Straczynski \\"Why me?\\" Why was his character being killed off? Straczynski told him \\"If he hadn't done such a good job, this wouldn't have happened, because no one would've cared about the character.\\" Dilgar The Dilgar were a race depicted in the show as an aggressive, warlike society who initiated a sudden and unexplained campaign of conquest against all neighboring worlds between 2229 and 2232. Regarding all alien species as little more than animals, the Dilgar slaughtered entire populations and ruthlessly enslaved the few survivors. A coalition between The League of Non-Aligned Worlds and the Earth Alliance reversed the Dilgar's advances and ultimately blockaded them on their homeworld. This victory established Earth, previously considered a newcomer, as an interstellar power. The cause of the Dilgar's abrupt attacks was revealed when their sun went supernova, wiping out almost the entire species. Only a single civilian colony on the planet Planthos survived the war and cataclysm. In the episode Deathwalker, a Dilgar survivor of the war appears on the Babylon 5 station in the year 2258 and is revealed to be Jha'Dur, known to many races as \\"Deathwalker\\" because of the many extravagant war crimes she committed. Following the war, Jha'Dur secretly entered the service of the \\"Wind Swords\\", a particularly militant Clan of the Minbari Warrior Caste. She came to Babylon 5 to establish her people's legacy via an immortality serum, claiming that it was so that all races could be indebted to the Dilgar for immortality. However, it is revealed that the immortality serum required the death of a sentient being to work: Deathwalker intended to increase war, bloodshed and other atrocities among the other races. She nearly accomplished her plan: an alliance of races attempted to employ her to refine a version of the serum that did not require murder; however, her Minbari flyer was destroyed by a Vorlon warship as she was leaving Babylon 5. The Dilgar are depicted as humanoid with pointed ears similar to Vulcans. They are designed to have somewhat longer eyes than the eyes of species such as Humans, Centauri, Minbari, Narn etc. Their pupils are vertically elongated similar to those of cats. The bridge of their nose is widened and goes up the forehead, making a v-shape rise in the forehead. The tips of their eyebrows are pointed, similar to Centauri eyebrows. =Jha'dur / Deathwalker= Jha'dur is a Dilgar specialist in biochemical, biogenetic, and cyber-organic weaponry, and was responsible for many of the atrocities committed by the Dilgar during the Dilgar war. Her activities earned her the epithet \\"Deathwalker\\". After the war, Jha'dur was sheltered by the Wind Swords, a militant clan of Minbari warriors, in exchange for her services as a weapons expert. When the war began, the Wind Swords approached the Grey Council and offered them devastating weapons that Jha'dur had developed in the preceding two decades. These weapons were never used against the humans, by order of the Grey Council. The Wind Swords concealed Jha'dur's existence from the other species until 2258, when she left Minbar and traveled to Babylon 5 with one of the fruits of her research: an experimental drug that retarded the aging process in humanoids, conferring immortality on whoever used it. A key ingredient in the drug could not be synthesized; it had to be extracted from living beings. The resulting genocidal wars would be her vengeance on Earth and the League for the extinction of her people. In the episode \\"Deathwalker\\", as Jha'dur's ship prepared to embark for Earth, a Vorlon warship arrived and destroyed it, vaporizing Jha'dur and the only existing sample of the drug. When asked why they killed her, Ambassador Kosh replied cryptically that the younger species were not ready for immortality. With the death of Jha'dur, the last trace of the Dilgar was erased from the galaxy. Narn  Another \\"young race\\" like humanity, the Narn Regime were previously occupied and enslaved by the Centauri, and bear them deep ill-will because of the brutal methods of control employed. Narns are widely perceived to be primitive and barbaric, a stereotype the Centauri engendered during their occupation. The Narn are led by the Kha'Ri council. Their religion venerates philosopher prophets, and most Narn draw strength from various different holy writings, the most noted being The Book of G'Quan. Narns are tall and have a stocky build; they are bald, with a yellowish complexion, mottled with brown and/or green spots. Although they appear reptilian, they are in fact marsupial and at least presumably mammalian, in nature. =Ta'Lon= Ta'Lon (Marshall R. Teague, credited as Marshall Teague) is a Narn soldier and pilot who encountered Captain John Sheridan when they were both captured and held aboard a Streib vessel. After being forced into brief gladiatorial combat, they helped each other to escape and Ta'Lon returned to the Narn homeworld to recover from his wounds. He later arrived on Babylon 5 serving as a bodyguard to the representative of the Centauri-occupied Narn government, a position he soon left, and remained on the station becoming a member of the Narn Resistance and lieutenant to Citizen G'kar. Upon G'kar's decision to resign as Ambassador to Babylon 5, it was Ta'Lon whom he selected as the new representative of Narn. As a matter of his sworn soldierly duty, Ta'Lon carries a Ka'tok, a ceremonial sword greatly resembling a katana that once drawn cannot be sheathed before drawing blood. Grasping the sword's hilt and unsheathing it only an inch is threat enough to discourage most foes. He is also known to draw the sword to add emphasis and dramatic effect to his statements despite knowing he then has to cut into his own hand to fulfill his duty to the sword. =Ko'Dath= Ko'Dath (Mary Woronov) is the aid to Narn ambassador, G'Kar, in the first season episode \\"Born to the Purple\\". Two episodes later it is revealed she died in an offscreen airlock accident, and she is replaced by Na'Toth. The character of Ko'Dath was originally intended to be a main character, and was named in the opening credits of \\"Born to the Purple\\" (in place of Na'Toth's credit). However, actress Mary Woronov had severe difficulties with the required prosthetic appliances and refused to wear the provided red contact lenses, and resigned after just one episode. Ko'Dath was hastily killed off as a result. Vorlon  The Vorlons are an ancient and technologically advanced race, one of the last of the First Ones. Little is known of Vorlon history, but they are known to have played a significant role in defeating the Shadows in the previous great wars over the past million years. For thousands of years, Vorlons have been observing and manipulating younger races, creating the telepaths of various species, including Humanity, who, for the most part, were initially created as weapons for the Vorlon's Wars with The Shadows. Little is known about their appearance. When interacting with other races they wear complex encounter suits that completely hide their true appearance. When Ambassador Londo Mollari of the Centauri Republic observed an unsuited Vorlon, he claimed to have not seen anything at all. Show creator J. Michael Straczynski has said about this that: \\"Londo saw what he said he saw.\\" At least one Babylon 5 novel contradicts Straczynski's statement, saying that Mollari saw a very bright ball of energy.David, P. Babylon 5: Legions of Fire - Out of the Darkness, Del Rey; 1st ed edition (October 31, 2000) =Kosh Naranek= Kosh Naranek was the Vorlon ambassador to Babylon 5 from 2257 until his death. He was physically played by producer Jeffrey Willerth, and the voice for the character was provided by Ardwight Chamberlain. Babylon 5's producer and creator, J. Michael Straczynski, has noted that Naranek is a title, not part of a name. Depicted as one of the older members of his species, Kosh Naranek was well regarded by the Vorlon Empire. The plot of the series pilot entailed Kosh's arrival, humanity's first contact with a Vorlon, and an attempt on his life by a member of the Wind Swords, a militant section of the Minbari warrior caste. Disguising himself as station Commander Jeffrey Sinclair, the would-be assassin poisoned Kosh. The Vorlon government prohibited opening Kosh's encounter suit. The Vorlon Government seemed to assume he would die, and demanded that both his body be returned and Commander Sinclair be sent to the Vorlon Homeworld for trial. With Sinclair's prompting, Doctor Benjamin Kyle decided to risk treating Kosh, which meant opening the encounter suit. Determining that a cure would be impossible without knowing where the poison entered the Vorlon, Dr. Kyle convinced newly arrived Psi Corps telepath Lyta Alexander to scan the Vorlon. Despite the very strict Psi Corps rules in such cases, Lyta performed the scan. Kosh's recovery was assured as the Minbari assassin was cornered. After Sheridan pleaded with Kosh for help against the Shadows, Kosh finally authorized the Vorlons to intervene, albeit in a limited capacity. Even so the Vorlon involvement turned the tide of that battle. The Shadows later broke into Kosh's chamber and murdered him in an act of reprisal. As Kosh was dying, Sheridan had a dream in which Kosh appeared to him in the form of Sheridan's father. As the dream ended and Sheridan woke, he realized that it was Kosh speaking to him and that he had been attacked. While most of Kosh perished in the attack, a small part managed to break off and hid within Sheridan. This portion would later be revealed during Sheridan's resurrection on Z'ha'dum. The last parts of Kosh's essence, finally released from Sheridan, would perish while fighting Ulkesh (Kosh II) with assistance from Lorien and Lyta Alexander. Others =Lorien= Lorien appears at the start of season four and again in the last episode of the show. He is played by Wayne Alexander. Alexander was also seen in Babylon 5 as Mr. Sebastian from the second season episode \\"Comes the Inquisitor\\" and as Drakh from the fifth season episode \\"The Fall of Centauri Prime\\". Lorien made his first appearance in the episode \\"The Hour of the Wolf\\". Lorien makes the statement that he is not a First One but rather the First One, belonging to a nearly immortal race of great wisdom and power, and, according to himself, the first being to achieve sentience in the universe. It was his race that discovered and nurtured many of what the Humans and Minbari refer to as the First Ones, including the Vorlons and the Shadows. In the millennia after most of the First Ones left the galaxy, Lorien came to reside on Z'ha'dum, and it is his continued presence there that draws the Shadows to return every time they are driven off. However, in late 2260, during the final Shadow War, Capt. John Sheridan of Babylon 5 comes to Z'ha'dum to parley with the Shadows. After this meeting ends poorly, with Sheridan exploding nuclear warheads within the Shadow capital city and leaping into a gorge, Sheridan ends up stuck between life and death in the depths of Z'ha'dum. During this dream state, Sheridan meets Lorien, and near the end of the ensuing discussion on life, death, and the universe, Lorien asks Sheridan a question: As Lorien lulls him to embrace death, this is the question Sheridan answers. Freed from the fear of death, Sheridan lets go, and Lorien in turn imbues Sheridan with a part of his own life force, returning Sheridan to life. Together they depart Z'ha'dum for Babylon 5, where Sheridan, presumed dead, arrives in time to prevent a rebellion among the alliance races. During the remnant of the Shadow War, Lorien becomes Sheridan's constant companion, serving as counselor, teacher, and ally. It is partly with Lorien's assistance that Sheridan is able to defeat the Vorlon ambassador Ulkesh after the Vorlon involvement in the Shadow War begins. Most critical, however, is Lorien's role in bringing about the end of the Shadow War in 2261, by providing a stage for Sheridan and Delenn to speak to both the Shadows and the Vorlons, and showing the alliance races the truth behind the war. In the end, beseeched by the Vorlons and the Shadows as if by children to their father, Lorien agrees to leave the galaxy with them and the remaining First Ones, ushering in a new era in the galaxy. However, Lorien reappears a last time, in 2281, when Sheridan returns to Coriana 6 during the last hours of his life, as he was enjoined by Kosh to do. =Zathras= Zathras is the name shared by a group of characters, all portrayed by Tim Choate. There were ten of these characters who appeared on several episodes throughout the series. The name of Zathras' species and homeworld were never revealed; in \\"War Without End\\", Zathras is seen living on Epsilon III and helping take care of the Great Machine with one other member of his race, although there is no evidence that this is their actual homeworld. The oldest Zathras is the oldest living (110 years old) caretaker of the Great Machine, in the service of the mysterious and messianic \\"The One\\" when first appearing. A slightly shaggy, slightly hunchbacked humanoid, Zathras is prone to deadpan delivery of somewhat cryptic, somewhat humorous, generally self-pitying statements, such as \\"Zathras is used to being beast of burden to other people's needs. Very sad life. Probably have very sad death. But, at least there is symmetry.\\", or \\"No one ever listens to poor Zathras, no, he's quite mad, they say. It is good that Zathras does not mind, has even grown to like it.\\" These speech patterns were patterned after J. Michael Straczynski's Polish-born grandmother's uneasy grasp of English.Introduction to the episode \\"Babylon Squared\\" in Volume 2 of The Scripts of J. Michael Straczynski He also refers to himself in the third person, although sometimes instead of himself, he refers to his brothers, as the story mentions that Zathras is one of 10 different brothers whose names all sound nigh- indistinguishably like 'Zathras'. This fact is revealed by a younger brother of the first Zathras ‚Äî the second Zathras to be seen ‚Äî who may appear twice, as \\"War Without End\\" features Tim Choate in a dual role as two Zathrases discussing the condition of the great machine. It is explained that the way to differentiate one Zathras from another is to listen to the inflection of the name. However, as he demonstrates the differences to Ivanova, she (and the audience) are unable to detect any difference between one and the others, though it may simply be due to humans lacking the aural sensitivity to detect the subtle differences in the inflections. The first Zathras travelled 1,000 years into the past on Babylon 4 with Jeffrey Sinclair, who (during the trip) transformed into the Minbari religious figure Valen in order to help the Minbari defeat the Shadows. The fate of the first Zathras is not fully known following the Minbari's acceptance of Sinclair as Valen, but Zathras does appear in the comic In Valen's Name and appears to act as Valen's assistant. In the comic, Rashok, a Minbari, attempts to speak to Valen, and Zathras prevents Rashok from doing so and is strong enough to overpower Rashok. Zathras appears to be of some importance as he states, \\"If Valen can listen to Zathras... you can listen to Zathras!\\" Rashok also refers to Zathras as Valen's \\"helpmate\\". The comic also shows how quickly Zathras' behavior can shift, as he goes from attacking Rashok to offering to make him a snack.

These environmental challenges are believed to be caused in part by unsustainable levels of production, consumption and advertising related to the imperfect exchange of information in market economies. Therefore, preorder economy theory advocates using the Internet as the means to coordinate all production with existing consumer desires, so that almost nothing is made which does not have someone ready to buy it.

History The Fischer sisters were 15 and 17 years old in 1963. Sally Gordon, also 17, was a friend and neighbor (another source says that all three were sisters). The Fischers' father was Carl Fischer, composer of standards such as Billie Holiday's \\"You've Changed\\" and \\"We'll Be Together Again,\\" sung by Frankie Laine. Carl Fischer was also Laine's musical director and arranger for 10 years. Their mother, Terry Sr., sang with the big bands of the day, ultimately becoming the first girl singer with the Stan Kenton Orchestra. Their grandmother and her three sisters played the vaudeville circuit as the Locus Sisters. Carol and Terry Fischer and Sally Gordon made their first recordings singing on demos produced by Mike Post. A school friend of Terry Fischer's, Post would occasionally have the Fischer sisters and Sally Gordon provide back-up vocals on sessions at Gold Star Studios. It was there that Kim Fowley, the in-house record producer at Chattahoochee Records, heard the trio and offered to record them on their own single. =\\"Popsicles and Icicles\\"= Billed as the Murmaids, the Fischer sisters and Sally Gordon recorded five tracks for Fowley: \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" (written by David Gates, the future founder and front man of the band Bread), and four other tracks ‚Äì \\"Blue Dress\\", \\"Bunny Stomp\\", \\"Comedy and Tragedy\\", and \\"Huntington Flats\\" ‚Äì each of which served as a B-side for one of the pressings of \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\". According to lead vocalist Terry Fischer, the Murmaids completed the tracks for an album release \\"a couple of weeks after we recorded the single.\\" The vocal arrangements for the Murmaids sessions were by Skip Battin. \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" began receiving airplay in Los Angeles in October 1963, breaking nationally in November, and reaching its peak at No. 3 on Billboard and Cash Box on charts dated 11 January 1964.Joel Whitburn, Top 40 Hits. . The song also spent three weeks at number two on the Middle-Road Singles (now called Adult Contemporary) chart. The Music Vendor chart ranked \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" at No. 1 for the week of 18 January. Music Vendors next No. 1 was \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" by the Beatles, \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" is sometimes cited as the last No. 1 of the pre-British Invasion rock and roll genre. In the UK, \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" was released on Stateside Records, with \\"Comedy and Tragedy\\" as the B-side. The tune did not chart, however, possibly due to unfamiliarity with the term popsicles, which in Britain are called \\"ice lollies\\". \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" did afford the Murmaids a hit in Australia (where popsicles were known as \\"icy poles\\") via a W&G; Records release (backed by \\"Comedy and Tragedy\\"), which reached No. 12 in February 1964. \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" was ranked No. 31 on Cash Boxs \\"Top 100 Chart Hits of 1964\\".\\"Top 100 Chart Hits of 1964\\", Cash Box, December 26, 1964. p. 12.

And that's all we did. At that time we got a statement from the record company charging us an exorbitant amount of money against royalties...Everyone else got paid. Kim Fowley got paid. The musicians got paid. We were paid nothing.\\" There was an album. Terry: \\"A couple of weeks after we recorded the single, we went in and recorded an album which we never heard until about five years ago. We never heard it at that time and that was over forty years ago.\\" In fact, Chattahoochee released two further singles off The Murmaids album‚Äî\\"Heartbreak Ahead\\" and \\"Wild and Wonderful\\"‚Äîand subsequently used the Murmaids name for at least two singles which did not feature any of the three \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" singers. The vocalists on these latterday Murmaids singles have been identified as Cathy Brasher‚Äîa solo act on the Chattahoochee roster‚Äîand Yvonne Young. Fowley said the Murmaids joined with Jackie DeShannon to form the Chattahoochee act the Lady-Bugs, whose cover of \\"How Do You Do It?\\", the Gerry and the Pacemakers 196 UK No. 1, lost out to the US re-release of the original in the summer of 1964. However, Fischer does not mention any involvement of any of the original Murmaids in that recording. In 1968, Liberty Records used the Murmaids name for the release of a single version of the Traffic song \\"Paper Sun\\". The vocalist on \\"Paper Sun\\" was Sally Gordon. That was the last \\"Murmaids\\" single release. Later history of Carol and Terry Fischer and Sally Gordon After \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" completed its chart run, Terry Fischer and Sally Gordon went off to college‚ÄîGordon going to Oregon‚Äîwhile Carol Fischer continued with high school. In 1969 Terry Fischer recorded as a member of The Carnival. whose self-titled album on Liberty was produced by Bones Howe; the Carnival also featured Janis Hansen and Jose Suares. both former members of S√©rgio Mendes and Brasil '66. Subsequently, Terry Fischer had a prolific career as a background vocalist with television appearances on Kraft Music Hall, The Merv Griffin Show, the Jerry Lewis Telethon and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and live work with Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorm√©, Don Rickles, Sonny and Cher and Tina Turner. Terry Fischer's career highlight came in 1977: while working as a percussionist and vocalist supporting Fabian in Lake Tahoe, she was spotted by sax player Sam Butera and invited to sing with Sam Butera and the Witnesses on their gig opening Frank Sinatra's Ol' Blue Eyes is Back Tour. Carol Fischer married John Morell, a prolific session guitarist. The couple have two sons, Justin and Christoph, who are both musicians. In 1995, Collectables Records issued a Golden Classics remastered CD of \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" featuring the original trio. In 1998, the Fischer sisters reformed The Murmaids with a third singer, Cynthia Perry (replaced by Petra Rowell, then replaced by Suzi Robertson), debuting the new act at a \\"Legends of Rock 'n Roll\\" show in Los Angeles in October of that year. They subsequently released a CD called The Murmaids Splash Back. Terry Fischer died on 28 March 2017 at age 70 from Parkinson's disease.

A set of Hit Stix consists of 2 drum sticks which are tethered to a small amplifier by audio cables. When the drum sticks are thrust forward in mid air, mimicking actual drum playing, a snare drum sound effect is produced. A rapid succession of thrusts produces a drum roll. It is a common misconception that Hit Stix are meant to be hit against another surface. In fact, the sounds are produced simply by the motion of drumming and do not need to come in contact with any surface in order to produce a sound. The Nasta company went public in 1987, and Hit Stix was its first television-advertised product. The Hit Stix instrument retailed for around $20 in 1980. Hit Stix was succeeded by Hit Stix 2, which incorporates sound selection via sliders on each drum stick. The left stick adjusts the tone while the right selects either snare, tom, bass drum or phaser. The latter instrument was capable of producing 44 different percussive sounds. Both incarnations feature a yellow and orange color scheme and a belt clip which allows the drummer to wear the amplifier on his or her hip. The amplifier requires one 9-volt battery and has a wheel for volume control.

The objective of the fortifications was to prevent the taking of key areas by an enemy‚Äînot only Germany but also Hungary and Poland‚Äîby means of a sudden attack before the mobilization of the Czechoslovak Army could be completed, and to enable effective defense until allies‚ÄîBritain and France, and possibly the Soviet Union‚Äîcould help. History With the rise of Hitler and his demands for unification of German minorities, including the Sudeten Germans, and return of other claimed territories‚ÄîSudetenland‚Äîthe alarmed Czechoslovak leadership began defensive plans. While some basic defensive structures were built early on, it was not until after conferences with French military on their design that a full scale effort began. A change in the design philosophy was noticeable in the \\"pillboxes\\" and larger blockhouses similar to the French Maginot line when the massive construction program began in 1936. The original plan was to have the first stage of construction finished in 1941‚Äì1942, whilst the full system should have been completed by the early 1950s. Construction was very rapid, and by the time of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, there were completed in total 264 heavy blockhouses (small forts or elements of strongholds) and 10,014 light pillboxes, which means about 20 percent of the heavy objects and 70 percent of the light objects. Moreover, many other objects were near completion and would have been functional at least as shelters despite missing certain heavy armaments in some structures.Ji≈ô√≠ Ho≈ô√°k, Are√°l ƒåeskoslovensk√©ho Opevnƒõn√≠ Darkoviƒçky, Pruvodce, 1995 After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia border regions as a result of the Sudeten Crisis, the Germans used these objects to test and develop new weapons and tactics, plan, and practise the attacks eventually used against the Maginot LineHalter 2011. and Belgium's forts, resulting in astounding success. After the fall of Belgium, France and the Low Countries, the Germans began to dismantle the \\"Bene≈° Wall\\", blowing up the cupolas, or removing them and the embrasures, some of which were eventually installed in the Atlantic Wall. Later in the war, with the Soviet forces to the east collapsing the German front, the Germans hurriedly repaired what they could of the fortifications, often just bricking up the holes where the embrasures once were, leaving a small hole for a machine gun. The east‚Äìwest portion of the line that ran from Ostrava to Opava which is a river valley with a steep rise to the south, became the scene of intense fighting. It is unknown how vital those fortifications were to German defense, but after hurried patching of some buildings leaving holes for machine-gun nests they were used against the Soviet advance from 17 to 26 April 1945. During World War II the Germans had removed many armored parts like domes, cupolas and embrasures from the majority of the objects. Some objects became subjects of German penetration shells or explosives testing and are heavily damaged. In the post-war period, many of the remaining armoured parts were scrapped as a result of a loss of their strategic value and general drive for steel. After the war they were further stripped of useful materials, and then sealed. A couple of the large underground structures continued to be used long after as military hardware storage, and some still are to this day, by the once again independent Czech Army. Design N-D-S 73 Je≈ô√°b, part of fortress Dobro≈°ov near N√°chod The basic philosophy of the design was a mutual defensive line, that is, most of the firepower was directed laterally from the approaching enemy. The facing wall of all the fortifications, large and small, was the thickest, covered with boulders and debris, and covered again with soil so even the largest caliber shells would have lost most of their energy before reaching the concrete. The only frontal armament was machine gun ports in cupolas designed for observation and anti-infantry purposes. Any enemy units that tried to go between the blockhouses would have been stopped by anti-tank, anti-infantry barricades, machine gun and cannon fire. A few of the larger blockhouses, or artillery forts, had indirect fire mortars and heavy cannon mounts. Behind the major structures were two rows of smaller four-to-seven-man pillboxes that mirrored their larger relatives, with a well protected front and lateral cross fire to stop any enemy that managed to get on top of the fort, or come up from behind. Most of the lines consisted of just the smaller pillboxes. The \\"light objects\\" were simple hollow boxes with one or two machine gun positions, a retractable observation periscope, grenade tubes, hand-operated air blower, and a solid inner door at 90 degrees to a steel bar outer door. The machine gun was mounted near the end of the barrel, so that the port hole was only large enough for the bullets and a scope to see through, unlike most other designs where a large opening is used. A heavy steel plate could be slid down to quickly close the tiny hole for added protection. The \\"heavy objects\\" were infantry blockhouses very similar to the southern part of the Maginot Line, but with substantial improvements. Just like the pillboxes, the cannons and machine guns were pivoted at the tip, and this time fully enclosed, protecting the occupants from all but the heaviest of cannons. The fortresses had a full ventilation system with filtration so even chemical attacks would not affect the defenders. Besides grid power, a two-cylinder diesel engine provided internal power. These fortifications also had full toilet and wash basin amenities, a luxury compared to its French counterpart casemates ‚Äì however, these facilities were designed to be used only during the combat. While largely hollow with a few concrete walls as part of the structure, each chamber was further divided into smaller rooms by simple brick and mortar walls, with a last gap at the ceiling filled with tarred cork, since construction of a few of the casemates stopped before the internal walls were finished.Josef Durƒç√°k, Pohraniƒçn√≠ opevnƒõn√≠ (Border Fortifications), AVE Opavska 1998.  Current state  K-S 5 U potoka Today almost all of the remaining light objects are freely accessible. Some of the heavy objects are also accessible, others may be rented or sold to enthusiasts. A certain number were turned into museums and very few into depots. The \\"Haniƒçka\\" Artillery Fort was being rebuilt into a modern shelter for the Ministry of Interior between 1979 and 1993, but declared unneeded in 1995. A museum has been created here. Many of the open museums are located between Ostrava and Opava, close to the present Polish border which had been the German border before World War II. Of the eight artillery forts that were either completed or under construction by September 1938, six now function as museums while two are still used by the military.

Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in these club, but only membership. Each club member (socio) has a vote to elect democratically the club president and board of directors. The club president cannot invest his own money into the club and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through merchandise sales, television rights and ticket sales. This means that each club is owned by its own registered supporters. FC Barcelona has over 150.000 socios, Real Madrid counts over 100.000 socios, Athletic Club over 40.000 and Osasuna over 15.000. Atl√©tico Madrid: major shareholders are the Gil Marin family which owns 50% of the shares, these used to belong to former club president Jes√∫s Gil y Gil; israeli businessman Idan Ofer, 33%; current president Enrique Cerezo 10% and the chinese Wanda Group a 2%. Eibar: more than 11.130 shareholders located across 65 countries due to a crowdfunding campaign in 2014. There is no major shareholder with an owenership over 5%.

Shabani moved to Sweden when he was four years old. Then his family moved to Bergen, before they settled down in Fredrikstad in 1999. Shabani is a local player from the club Trosvik in Fredrikstad, who have raised several Fredrikstad players, Tarik Elyounoussi and Lasse Staw are some of the most notable ones. Shabani played his first official match for Fredrikstad in the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup Final, where Fredrikstad beat Sandefjord 3‚Äì0. In the 2007 season, he managed to get three red cards in three different competitions in four days. His first sending-off came in a Norwegian Premier League match, then next day for Fredrikstad's reserve team in the Norwegian Second Division.

Snow Francis Huntington Snow (June 29, 1840 ‚Äì September 21, 1908) was an American professor and chancellor of the University of Kansas (KU), and he became prominent through the discovery of a fungus fatal to chinch bugs and its propagation and distribution. Born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, he was the son of Benjamin and Mary B. (Boutelle) Snow, and one of his paternal ancestors, Richard Warren, was a member of the Mayflower company. He was married on June 8, 1868, to Jane Appleton Aiken. Snow attended the Fitchburg high school in preparation for Williams College, where he graduated in 1862, standing first in his class. After teaching one year as principal of the Fitchburg high school he entered the Andover Theological Seminary, completing its course of study in 1866. This same year he received his master's degree from Williams. He would later receive a Ph.D. from Williams in 1881, and the degree of LL.D. from Princeton University in 1890. He was a member of the college fraternity Delta Upsilon, and of the honorary societies Sigma Xi and Phi Beta Kappa at KU. After leaving Andover Seminary he preached for a while, although not regularly installed as pastor. \\"He served two seasons with the Christian commission at the front of the Union army, being present at Lee's surrender.\\" In 1866 he was elected to the first faculty of the University of Kansas as professor of mathematics and natural sciences. During the first year he spent in Lawrence, Kansas, he preached almost every Sunday in nearby pulpits. In 1870 Snow became professor of natural history, and during the next decade he organized the collecting expeditions which resulted in the natural history museum at the university. Snow was the curator of all the natural history collections until 1891, when he hired his former student, Lewis Lindsay Dyche, to curate the zoological collections; the entomological and botanical collections were curated by Snow. Despite an early affinity for botany, Snow's primary research was in entomology. This is because shortly after Snow came to Kansas, James A. Carruth was appointed as state botanist, and he decided not to duplicate Carruth‚Äôs work. The R.L. McGregor Herbarium at KU houses over 500 of Snow's botanical specimens, but many of his early specimens were sent to Carruth‚Äôs herbarium and eventually lost. Adapted from a longer manuscript entitled \\"History of the University of Kansas Herbarium, 1866‚Äì1990\\" by R.L. McGregor. In the entomological collection there are more than 200 species of insects discovered by him. Snow started the first scientific publication of the university, The Observer of Nature, and for some years he was editor of the scientific journal Psyche. He made frequent contributions to the university bulletins and reports and to the Kansas Academy of Science, of which he was a founder and president. Throughout his connection with the university he made and published systematic meteorological reports. In 1886 the legislature appropriated $50,000 for the erection of a new building designed by John G. Haskell which was named Snow Hall of Natural History in his honor. Seriously deteriorated by 1915, the original limestone building was demolished in 1934, and salvaged stone was used on the university's Military Science Building. The new Snow Hall was opened in 1930. In 1890 the university received a bequest from his uncle, William B. Spooner, with which Spooner library and the chancellor's residence were erected. Snow was the fifth chancellor of the university from 1890 until 1901. Snow died at Delafield, Wisconsin on September 21, 1908. He was survived by his wife and four of his five children.

She wrote the book Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress. This book is considered the seminal piece of literature dealing with the effects of growing up as a military brat. In writing the book, Wertsch, a reporter by training, interviewed over 80 military brats and documented the patterns she found in the ways military children are raised, and the ways they continue to be affected, both positively and negatively, well into adulthood. Early life Born into a career Army family, Mary Brightwell Edwards, as she was then named, lived in 20 houses and attended 12 schools by the time she was 18. She has one brother, David, born in 1940. Their father. David Lincoln Edwards (USMA, 1936), took the family overseas on assignments to West Germany in the early 1950s and to France in the early 1960s, where Mary attended a French school for two years (the Lycee Internationale, also known as SHAPE School, then in St. Germain-en- Laye, France). Bases where she lived growing up include Ft. Myer, Virginia; Ft. Bragg, North Carolina; and Ft. Monroe, Virginia. She graduated from the College of William & Mary in 1973 with a B.A. in philosophy, and began a career in journalism. She worked for two newspapers in Virginia, doing investigative reporting, feature writing, and a column, before moving to San Francisco and Chicago to pursue other projects. In 1985 she married James V. Wertsch, Ph.D. They have two sons. Wertsch now lives in St. Louis, where her husband is on the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis. She is routinely interviewed and invited to speak on the subject of military brats. She collaborates with Marc Curtis of the Military Brat Registry to present workshops for military brats around the country and on annual cruises. She is the founder and president of Brightwell Publishing, the first publishing house dedicated to books and films that explore and strengthen military brat cultural identity, and writes The Military Brat Blog. Book and Other Writing Wertsch wrote the book Military Brats: Legacies of Growing Up Inside the Fortress (1991) that studied and analyzed the lives of 80 American military brats. Through this process, her book identifies military brats as a hidden American subculture, and details patterns in this population along sociological and psychological lines. Wertsch is currently writing a second book that also discusses military brats, but includes discussion of other types of Third culture children as well. She has stated that the new book will focus on Third culture children and the experience of \\"Belonging\\" as this relates to outsider feelings held widely by this population. Operation Footlocker Wertsch, along with Reta Jones Nicholson and Gene Moser, was also behind the inspiration for Operation Footlocker. Operation Footlocker is a mobile monument for military brats, and is currently managed by the Museum of the American Military Family in Albuquerque, New Mexico. There have been as many as three footlockers that travel around the country to brat organizations and gatherings.

When the locker is filled, it is emptied and the contents are safely stored in the MAMF museum archives, and brought out for exhibits honoring the millions of children who have been and will be shaped by this unique way of life. Documentary In 2006, Army brat and filmmaker Donna Musil completed a documentary film based largely on the research and analysis presented in Wertsch's book, and funded by small monetary and in-kind contributions from military brats to her non-profit organization, Brats without Borders. Musil's film, Brats: Our Journey Home, has been enthusiastically received by military brats nationwide, and is considered a major boost to the military brat cultural identity movement. Brightwell Publishing Wertsch is also the founder and CEO of a small publishing house, Brightwell Publishing, that focuses on publishing the works of military brat authors.

The castle is located in Fukuyama Park in Fukuyama, Hiroshima near Fukuyama Station. Overview The castle was built on a hill on the Fukuyama plain and it was the capital of Bingo Fukuyama Han. Construction was started in 1619 during the Genna era, and was completed in 1622. The castle was erected by Mizuno Katsunari, one of the first Tokugawa hereditary vassals, on order by the Tokugawa sh≈çgun. The castle stood seven stories tall, and was surrounded by double moats which provided an inlet to the Seto Inland Sea. The Mizuno clan maintained control over the castle from its construction until 1700. Fukuyama Castle was one of the tenshu that survived the Meiji Restoration, however it suffered extensive damage from Allied attacks in World War II; most buildings of the castle were destroyed. Most of the dry stone was later removed, and Fukuyama Station was built very near where the castle stood. The main tower was rebuilt with concrete in 1966.

Career =Cork City= Born in Cambridge, Murray initially signed for Cork City on loan in 2002, under former manager Liam Murphy, from Peterborough United. One year later, he signed permanently for Cork. During his time on Leeside, he scored vital goals in European competition against Malm√∂ FF in the UEFA Intertoto Cup (2004), Apollon Limassol in the UEFA Champions League qualifier in 2006 and FC Haka in the UEFA Cup in 2008. He is Cork's highest scorer in European competition. He was booked twice in their run during the 2006 UEFA Champions League qualifiers, once for an imitation of an Apollon Limassol player diving, and secondly during Cork's home game against Crvena Zvezda,http://www.rte.ie/sport/2006/0726/corkcity.html when over-eagerly recovering a ball from an opposition player for a throw-in. This saw him miss the away leg in the Marakana, with his replacement being the untested Brian O'Callaghan. In 2005, Murray was the captain of the League of Ireland Championship winning team that won the title on the last day against Derry City. Murray's displays in the League of Ireland attracted interest from abroad, his name being linked with English Championship and League One clubs. During the 2008 campaign, with Murray an ever-present at the heart of the Cork defence, Cork kept 31 clean sheets in all competitions. In January 2010, the continuing degradation of his relationship with Cork City chairman Tom Coughlan and incoming manager Roddy Collins - including the removal of his captaincy to be given to recurrent City signing George O'Callaghan - resulted in a mutual cancellation of his contract with Cork City. Murray admitted that money was a factor in his move; the continuous waiting for payment from the nearly bankrupt club placing strain upon his family life. =Shamrock Rovers= He signed for Shamrock Rovers on 5 February 2010, and made his debut that night as a second-half substitute in a pre-season friendly win over Shelbourne. He was appointed captain in February 2010. In his two seasons at Rovers he won 2 League of Ireland Premier Division titles, the Setanta Cup and played in the group stages of the Europa League. He played in 14 European games for Rovers where he was captain in all 8 games in the Hoops' historic 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Europa League campaign. Murray was released in January 2012. =Return to Cork City= Murray signed for Cork City once again on 19 January 2012. It was announced that he would also regain his Captaincy. Murray retired after the 2015 season at the age of 33, after a total of 10 years at the club, scoring 19 times in 307 league appearances.

It involves a large number of lay and monastic practitioners and is led by at least one High Lama. It is regarded as a very powerful practice, and is said to act as a remedy to the negative forces at work in the world, and to promote inner personal peace, peace within the community and world peace. Tibetan Buddhists traditionally regard attendance at a drubchen as producing the same benefit as practising alone for seven years. The practice requires prayers and the drubchen mantra to be recited by practitioners for twenty-four hours a day throughout the period of the retreat.

Its companion light, La Vieille, is 260 metres to the north-east. At a meeting on 5 June 1886, the lighthouse commission decided to construct a new tower near the La Vieille lighthouse, which was itself then in progress. Construction began in 1887, but had to be halted quickly because the ship necessary for its construction, \\"La Confiance\\", was in use elsewhere. The works, always in summer, were resumed in 1893 and completed in 1896. The octagonal turret is supported on a cylindrical base, these two parts being mounted on reinforced concrete. The whole rises to about 9.50 meters above the highest seas. On December 4, 1896, a violent storm broke over the tower which was \\"beheaded\\". Reconstruction work was completed in 1909 due to many difficulties. The first tests took place in 1910. On August 31, 1911, a permanent green fixed light, burning oil, was installed.

SkidLo. Retrieved on 4 October 2013. The given name is a cursive Êñá and not a ‰πã. born November 14, 1974) is an American citizen born in Taiwan who perpetrated the shooting at Bard College at Simon's Rock on December 14, 1992, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He murdered one student and a professor, and wounded four people, before he surrendered to police. He is currently serving two life sentences without the possibility of parole.  Background  Lo was born in Tainan, Taiwan, to Chia Wei Lo, a fighter pilot, and Lin Lin Lu, a violin teacher, both Mainland Chinese immigrants to Taiwan. The Lo family moved to the United States in spring 1981, living in a suburban neighborhood in Rockville, Maryland while Chia Wei Lo was assigned to a diplomatic post in Washington, D.C. While living in Maryland, the 7-year-old Lo became a violinist with the Montgomery County Youth Orchestra. His family returned to Taiwan in 1983, after Chia-Wei relinquished his position that year. The family later settled in northwest Billings, Montana, in summer 1987. His parents later managed the Great Wall Chinese restaurant at Grand Avenue in Billings. He attended Lewis & Clark Junior High School in Billings for seventh to eighth grade, before attending Billings Central Catholic High School for his freshman and sophomore year. Lo was a violinist in the Billings Symphony Orchestra beginning at age fourteen. He attended the Aspen Music Festival in 1990 and studied under the prominent violin teacher Dorothy DeLay. Lo had a GPA of 3.56 in his sophomore year. In April 1991, Lo was accepted by Simon's Rock College of Bard in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and given the W.E.B. DuBois minority scholarship, beginning fall classes that September. He had wanted to attend a boarding school to estrange himself from his father. While attending Simon's Rock, Lo expressed racist and fascist beliefs. He wrote an essay arguing for segregation of homosexuals to prevent the spread of AIDS, and denied the historicity of the Holocaust. Other students reported being uncomfortable with these beliefs. The shooting On the morning of December 14, 1992, Simon's Rock receptionist Teresa Beavers searched a package addressed to Lo from the North Carolina company Classic Arms, and found 7.62 caliber ammunition inside the package.FindLaw.com article on shooting She notified college residence directors, and called for an investigation of Lo's dormitory. Residence director Katherine Robinson went to Lo's dormitory and asked Lo if she could see the contents of the package. Lo refused and Robinson informed the associate dean of students. Robinson returned to Lo's dormitory with her husband and searched his room, but found no weapons or ammunition. Lo told them the ammunition was a Christmas gift for his father; Lo was sent to the dean's office, and later the dean dismissed him, suspecting he was not possessing any weapons on the school campus. Reports were inconsistent, as other students had made complaints about Lo stockpiling ammunition in his dormitory. Chris Lucht, associate dean, had allegedly refused to investigate. That night, an anonymous person phoned school officials, claiming that Lo was armed with weapons and was going to kill members of the Robinson family. The caller identified himself as another student with whom Lo had dinner that night. The Robinsons contacted the college provost, Ba Win, and went with their children to stay at Win's home in Lee, Massachusetts. There they called the dean to locate Lo; no precaution was taken, however, and the police were never notified. Lo was hiding the ammunition which he had ordered two days earlier. On December 14, at around 10:00 a.m. Lo travelled by taxi to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and purchased a SKS semi-automatic rifle at Dave's Sporting Goods store. The shooting began at approximately 10:20 p.m. in the school security area. He shot Teresa Beavers twice in the abdomen, and later fatally shot a Spanish language teacher √ëacu√±√°n S√°ez while he was driving his Ford Festiva. Lo then left the security area and entered the library. Inside he killed student Galen Gibson and wounded another student. He left the library and walked towards an adjacent dormitory where he wounded two freshmen students. Lo's rifle jammed and he dropped his weapon before he walked to the student union building and phoned police to tell them of his actions. Lo surrendered to police without further incident. Those killed in the shooting were student Galen Gibson, 18, and teacher √ëacu√±√°n S√°ez, 37. Gibson was a poetry major from Gloucester, Massachusetts, while S√°ez was an Argentine-born Spanish professor. Those wounded were the receptionist Teresa Beavers, 40, and students Thomas McElderry, 19, Joshua A. Faber, 17, and Matthew Lee David, 18. In the February 22, 2013, PBS Need to Know show titled \\"After Newtown\\" (see Newtown Mass Murder) the journalist Maria Hinojosa reported, \\"In fact, in an interview with Newsweek in 2007 after 32 people were killed in the Virginia Tech shootings ... Wayne Lo said: 'The fact that I was able to buy a rifle in 15 minutes, that's absurd. I was 18. I couldn't have rented a car to drive home from school, yet I could purchase a rifle. Obviously a waiting period would be great. Personally, I only had five days left of school before winter break ... If I had a two-week waiting period for the gun, I wouldn't have done it.'\\" PBS Need to Know transcript February 22, 2013  Imprisonment  Lo's month-long trial took place at the Berkshire County House of Corrections in Pittsfield. Although claims were made by the media prior to the trial regarding Lo's supposed racist beliefs, he was never charged with a hate crime, and the racism accusations were never substantiated. Instead, the focus turned to his mental state at the time of the shooting as Lo made an insanity plea. His psychiatrists testified that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, while a court-appointed psychiatrist attributed Lo's actions merely to narcissistic personality disorder. The jury agreed with the prosecution, and Lo was found guilty on all 17 charges against him, and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences without possibility of parole.Wayne Lo Interview, Serial Killer Calendar Lo spent nine months at a maximum security facility at Walpole, Massachusetts, from February to November 1994. He was later transferred to MCI-Norfolk, a medium security prison in Norfolk, Massachusetts. Aftermath In 1999, Gregory Gibson, the father of victim Galen Gibson, wrote Gone Boy: A Walkabout, a detailed book recounting the shooting. The book spurred correspondence between Gibson and Lo, which was detailed in a New York Times article, as well as a German TV documentary film. In December 2017, Lo was interviewed by Gibson. In the video, Lo explains how easy it is to legally obtain a semi-automatic rifle in the United States. Lo wore a sweatshirt with the name of the New York City hardcore punk band Sick of It All during the shooting. This spurred the band to issue press releases denouncing Lo's crimes. The journalist Chuck Klosterman wrote a passage in his book, Killing Yourself to Live, (pages 133‚Äì134) in which Wayne Lo writes Klosterman a letter from prison contemplating what questions might have been raised if Lo were arrested wearing a T-shirt with the bands Poison or Warrant instead of Sick of It All. The Simon's Rock College of Bard shooting is detailed in chapter two of the book Ceremonial Violence: A Psychological Explanation of School Shootings by Jonathan Fast. The controversy surrounding Lo's chapter and the book arose after Gibson published an article regarding allegations of plagiarized passages taken directly from Gone Boy: A Walkabout.http://hubertsfreaksspeak.blogspot.com/2008/12/sr-porn.html Lo has his own website, SkidLo.net.http://www.skidlo.net/ The website is co-owned by Lo and his friend Zachary Godwin. It was established to help the victims of Lo's rampage. On the site, those interested may purchase drawings, paintings, and embroidered art made by Lo. All the proceeds are donated to The Galen Gibson Fund. Currently, Skid Lo is the largest contributor to the fund. SkidLo.net received much public attention after the Virginia Tech massacre. Subsequently, the Berkshire County District Attorney, David F. Capeless, tried to pass legislation banning such items from being sold by inmates after he became aware of the website's existence. Others fought for the site's right to exist by citing the First Amendment right of free speech. Another controversy was raised when there were accusations that the money was not being donated to the scholarship fund. Several newspapers and television stations later confirmed that Gibson was in fact receiving money from SkidLo.net. Lo was an inspiration for the 2019 feature film Cuck by director Rob Lambert. Rob rode the school bus with Wayne while they both lived in Billings, MT.

The bonus rule was a rule instituted by Major League Baseball in 1947 that prevented teams from assigning certain players to farm teams. The rule stipulated that when a major league team signed a player to a contract in excess of $4,000 ($ today), the team was required to keep that player on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons. Any team that failed to comply with the rule lost the rights to that player's contract, and the player was then exposed to the waiver wire. Once a player remained with the team for two full seasons, he could be assigned a farm team without repercussions. The rule went through several variations until it was finally abolished in 1965, when the Major League Baseball draft was initiated.  History of the rule  In the late 1930s and early 1940s, major league franchises found themselves bidding against one another for the services of young players. These engagements subsided when World War II broke out. When the war ended, the bidding wars resumed. This competition for the best amateur athletes resulted in skyrocketing signing bonuses. In 1947, Major League Baseball implemented the bonus rule. The rule prevented the wealthiest teams from signing all of the best players and from stashing those players in their farm systems. Additionally, the bonus market was weakened as a result of inhibited competition. In return, this limited labor costs. The legitimacy of the rule was challenged several times after it was initially implemented. In December 1950, the rule was rescinded. In 1952, a committee chaired by Branch Rickey revived the rule. It was this iteration of the rule that stated a team had to place the players who met the bonus rule criteria on the major league roster immediately. Furthermore, the player had to remain on the roster for two years from the signing date. Although the players were signed as a result of their potential, some players were not able to succeed. In an extreme case, pitcher Tom Qualters was on the active roster of the Philadelphia Phillies for all of 1953 and 1954, but pitched only 1/3 of an inning in one game of the 1953 season, and did not get into a game at all in 1954. Qualters did not appear in his second major league game until 1957, and never recorded a victory as a big league pitcher. The New York Yankees worked out a deal with the Kansas City Athletics where the Athletics signed Clete Boyer to a contract. The Athletics used Boyer sparingly for the two years they had him. Then, just days after the first date at which the Athletics could send Boyer down to the minor leagues, they traded him to the Yankees as the player to be named later from a trade the previous winter. This trade did not sit well with the owners of the other American League teams. They claimed that the Yankees had used the Athletics to hold Boyer. However, the deal was allowed by the league. Incidents like the Clete Boyer trade showed how the bonus rule could be circumvented. Rumor also spread that teams were ignoring the rule and bribing players. In 1958, both leagues voted to rescind the rule. In addition, they rescinded it retroactively. This eliminated the major league roster requirement for the players signed in 1957. After the league added four new teams (the Angels and Senators, followed by the Colt .45s and Mets), the bonus rule was reintroduced in 1962. The difference between the new version of the rule and the previous one was that a player had to spend just one full season on the roster instead of two seasons. Franchises were also allowed one exception, a \\"designated player\\" who could play in the minor leagues but would still count against the major league team's 25-man active roster. In June 1965, the Major League Baseball draft was introduced. Each drafted player was required to negotiate with the team that selected him. This brought an end to the bonus rule.  Bonus babies  Bonus babies were the group of amateur baseball players who went straight to the major leagues between the years 1947 and 1965 and received a signing bonus in excess of $4,000. The bonus rule prevented the player from spending time in the Minor League Baseball system that was, and is, the training ground for most professional baseball players in the United States, and came under criticism because it often caused such a player to languish on a major league bench instead of gaining experience in the minors.  Hall of Fame  Five of the 1947‚Äì1965 bonus babies had produced Hall of Fame careers: Al Kaline, Harmon Killebrew, Sandy Koufax, Roberto Clemente and Catfish Hunter. Of the five, only Killebrew, a bonus baby for the Washington Senators, saw any minor league service time once his mandatory bonus baby period expired. Kaline, Koufax, and Hunter never played in the minor leagues. Clemente was signed by the Dodgers who attempted to hide him in the minors, but was discovered by a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates and drafted by them in 1955.

The novel continues the story of Tatiana Metanova and her husband Alexander Barrington.  Plot  Four years have gone by since World War II has ended; and Tatiana and Alexander are married and living a life together with their son, Anthony. Yet, they are strangers to each other. Having been separated from each other for years, they do not know each other anymore. They live a satisfactory life, with Alexander working as a lobster-man - coming home each day smelling of fish. Tatiana is now known to outsiders as 'Tania'. They move from place to place. After Alexander confesses to why he was so cold to her, they reconcile and move houses. Finally living in a place that they've dreamed of, Tatiana's friend Vikki phones her to say that the USA government is looking for Alexander. Fearing for her husband's safety, she does not tell him. Finding out himself somehow, he goes to Washington to make everything right - also finding out that his supposedly executed mother \\"is still alive\\" in a concentration camp. Realising though, that he has been tricked by an enemy, he does not go to search for her. He meets Tom Richter - a lieutenant colonel - and earns himself a job in Yuma as a captain of the Military Intelligence arm of the U.S. Army. Time passes by, and the family moves to Phoenix.

It can be seen to be the Soviet Union's version of the Marshall Plan, which for political reasons the Eastern European countries would not be able to join without leaving the Soviet sphere of influence. Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov rejected the Marshall Plan (1947), proposing instead the Molotov Plan‚Äîthe Soviet-sponsored economic grouping which was eventually expanded to become the Comecon.\\"CNN Cold War - Profile: Vyacheslav Mikhaylovic Molotov\\". The Molotov Plan was symbolic of the Soviet Union's refusal to accept aid from the Marshall Plan, or allow any of their satellite states to do so because of their belief that the Marshall Plan was an attempt to weaken Soviet interest in their satellite states through the conditions imposed and by making beneficiary countries economically dependent on the United States (Officially, one of the goals of the Marshall Plan was to prevent the spread of Communism). The plan was a system of bilateral trade agreements which also established Comecon to create an economic alliance of socialist countries.\\"World History Study Guide - 17.2 The Cold War between 1945 and 1947\\". This aid allowed countries in Europe to stop relying on American aid and therefore allowed Molotov Plan states to reorganize their trade to the Soviet Union instead.\\"A Look back at the Marshall Plan\\".

Originally designed to carry quarried stone in horse-drawn wagons, it became part of an ambitious plan to link the Lancashire coast to the heart of Yorkshire. The plan failed, and the line closed to passengers in 1930 and to goods in 1967. Early history The Preston and Longridge Railway Company was set up in 1836 to build a tramway from the newly opened Tootle Heights Quarry in Longridge to Preston. The 6¬Ω-mile (10¬Ω km) single-track line was opened on 1 May 1840, with crude passenger facilities at , and in Preston.Suggitt, p.49; Till, p.88; Welch, p.21; Pattinson, p.5; Hunt, p.117 Wagons were horse-drawn from Preston uphill to Longridge. Wagons ran by gravity in the opposite direction as far as Ribbleton, which was then a village just outside Preston. Horses were used for the final two miles (3 km) to Deepdale. Longridge ashlar sandstone was widely used in the region, for example in the building of Lancaster Town Hall, Bolton Town Hall, Preston railway station and Liverpool Docks.Suggitt, p.49; Till, p.89; Pattinson, p.5 Development In 1846, the Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway (FP&WRR;) Company was set up. It had an ambitious plan to link Fleetwood on the Lancashire coast to Leeds and Bradford in Yorkshire. It would link the existing Preston and Wyre Joint Railway to the Longridge line in Preston, and build a new line from via Ribchester, Hurst Green and Clitheroe to Skipton, where it would join the proposed Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway. The line would give Lancashire passengers access to the spa towns of Harrogate and Knaresborough, and beauty spots such as Bolton Abbey. Reciprocally, it would give Yorkshire passengers access to the seaside resorts of Fleetwood and Blackpool. Freight trains would carry cattle from Craven Valley, and stone from quarries near Clitheroe as well as from Longridge. Stonyhurst College would be within a mile of the line and would be able to use it to bring in supplies as well as pupils.Till, p.91; Suggitt, p.49 The P&LR; was duly leased to the FP&WRR.; The line was adapted for steam and the first steam-hauled train ran on Whit Monday 1848.Till, p.91; Suggitt, p.50; Pattinson, p.5 Miley Tunnel In 1850, a double-track extension was built connecting to the existing line a few hundred yards east of the terminus. The line passed via the Miley Tunnel under the north part of Preston and connected to the Preston and Wyre Joint Railway very close to that line‚Äôs original terminus at . The extension was initially used for goods only.Hunt, p.117; Suggitt, p.50 The first work on the Grimsargh to Skipton line was the excavation of a short cutting (which still exists) south of Hurst Green (at ), but then the project was abandoned. In 1852, the FP&WRR; Company collapsed. The Preston and Longridge Railway acquired the engines and rolling stock of the collapsed company in lieu of owed rental fees.Till, p.92 and p.98 However, in 1856 a reformed Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway Company purchased the line. The line through Miley Tunnel was opened to passengers, with new stations at each end, at on Deepdale Road and at . The original terminus was closed to passengers but continued to be used for goods.Till, p.101; Suggitt, p.50 By 1866, the plan to extend the line to Yorkshire had been revived. Fearing that the rival Midland Railway would buy the line to gain access to Preston, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) bought the line instead. From the following year, the line was owned jointly by the L&YR; and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR).Till, p.101; Suggitt, p.51 In 1885, Maudland Bridge Station was closed and passenger trains ran on to the adjacent LNWR main line to Preston Station, allowing connections to other railway lines for the first time.Suggitt, p.51; Hunt, p.117 Whittingham Hospital branch In June 1889, a private branch line was opened northwards from to Whittingham Asylum two miles (3 km) away. As well as supplies, hospital staff and visitors were carried free of charge in converted goods brake vans. Trains (as many as twelve per day) were timed to connect with passenger trains at Grimsargh. The locomotives used on the hospital branch were industrial types with the exception of the ex-London, Brighton and South Coast Railway no. 357, Riddlesdown, which was purchased in February 1948 from British Railways for ¬£745. The hospital line continued to operate long after the main branch closed to passengers in 1930. The hospital trains were now timed to connect with bus services at Grimsargh. The line eventually closed on 29 June 1957.Suggitt, p.56; Pattinson, p.138 Decline In 1918 there was another plan to extend the railway from Longridge to Yorkshire along the Loud and Hodder valleys to Whitewell, Tosside, Wigglesworth and Hellifield, but the plan was never implemented.Till, p.100; Suggitt, p.52 This plan was revived once more in 1924 in connection with the Stocks Reservoir scheme and a Light Railway Order was confirmed on 19 March, however no further action was taken.Bowtell, p. 30-31 By 1930 the popularity of bus travel caused the line to close to passengers. The line to Longridge remained open to goods traffic until November 1967.Till, p.101; Suggitt, p.52; Pattinson, p.15; Welch, p.21 Goods traffic continued to use part of the line as far as the Courtaulds factory at Red Scar,Hunt, p.117 until the last train worked by class 25 diesel, number 25 142 on Friday 8 February 1980.Hilbert, p.44 The Gamull Lane bridge over the line at was subsequently removed.Potter, p.46 All that now remained of the whole line was a Y-shaped link between the West Coast Main Line and coal yards at the site of the original Deepdale Street terminus.Suggitt, p.53 This, too, was closed in the 1990s, although the tracks for this section were never taken up. Remains The track through Miley Tunnel, though rusty and overgrown, still exists., Exploration of tunnel, taken from NWEX.CO.UK The line‚Äôs route in Preston between Blackpool Road and Red Scar is now a cycle path and footpath. It is planned to extend the path to Grimsargh.Preston to Longridge Disused Railway , Lancashire County Council website, accessed 15 June 2007 In Longridge, a portal to a blocked-off tunnel under Higher Road that led to Tootle Heights Quarry is a Grade II listed building. The station buildings at and still survive.Suggitt, p.55; Pattinson, p.90 and p.19; Mitchell et al., p.27 In 2003, the Preston City Link Canal Trust was formed with a plan to reopen part of the Lancaster Canal to a new marina to be constructed in the vicinity of the former Maudland Bridge railway station. One option being considered was to reopen the Longridge line as far as Deepdale or Ribbleton, the line passing by viaduct over the new marina.Broom, E. \\"Answer to Preston‚Äôs transport problems?\\", Lancashire Evening Post 12 February 2007, accessed online 18 June 2007; \\"Preston City Link Canal Trust\\" accessed 13 June 2007 In 2010, light rail manufacturer Trampower UK opened negotiations to use a segment of the former route as a tram demonstrator line. Initially, Trampower UK would use the line from the Miley Tunnel portal to Ribbleton,(26 March 2010), \\"Tram system demo could be in place soon\\", Lancashire Evening Post, Preston, accessed 2011-08-04 however their long term ambition is to provide a service on the line from the M6 Junction 31A to Preston city centre.

Previously, the superfamily Pseudopimelodoidea was sister to superfamilies Sisoroidea + Loricarioidea. However, some evidence has shown this family, along with Pimelodidae, Heptapteridae, and Conorhynchos, may form a monophyletic assemblage, which contradicts the hypothesis that the former family Pimelodidae that included these families is a polyphyletic group. Distribution The Pseudopimelodidae are restricted to fresh water in South America, from the Atrato River in Colombia to Argentina in the R√≠o de la Plata. Description These catfishes have wide mouths, small eyes, and short barbels. Their bold markings lead them to be commonly known as bumblebee catfishes or dwarf marbled catfishes. B. acanthochiroides grows to 80.0 cm (31 in) TL. However, most species are smaller; species of the genus Microglanis rarely exceed 70 mm(2.8 in) SL and are never over 80 mm (3.1 in) SL.

Detail with one of the tondi. Adoration of the Magi by Domenico Ghirlandaio. The Ospedale degli Innocenti (; 'Hospital of the Innocents', also known in old Tuscan dialect as the Spedale degli Innocenti) is a historic building in Florence, Italy. It was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, who received the commission in 1419 from the Arte della Seta. It was originally a children's orphanage. It is regarded as a notable example of early Italian Renaissance architecture. The hospital, which features a nine bay loggia facing the Piazza SS. Annunziata, was built and managed by the \\"Arte della Seta\\" or Silk Guild of Florence. That guild was one of the wealthiest in the city and, like most guilds, took upon itself philanthropic duties. Today the building houses a small museum of Renaissance art with works by Luca della Robbia, Sandro Botticelli, Piero di Cosimo and an Adoration of the Magi by Domenico Ghirlandaio. Fa√ßade The fa√ßade is made up of nine semicircular arches springing from columns of the Composite order. The semicircular windows bring the building down, earthbound and is a revival of the classical style, no longer a pointed arch. In the spandrels of the arches there are glazed blue terracotta roundels with reliefs of babies designed by Andrea della Robbia suggesting the function of the building. There is an emphasis on the horizontal because the building is longer than it is tall. Above each semicircular arch is a tabernacle window (a rectangular window with a triangular pediment on the top). The building reveals a clean and clear sense of proportion. The height of the columns is the same as the width of the intercolumniation and the width of the arcade, making each bay a cube. The building's simple proportions reflect a new age, one of secular education, and a sense of great order and clarity. Similarly, the height of the entablature is half the column height, as is appropriate for a clear- minded society. Children were sometimes abandoned in a basin which was located at the front portico. However, this basin was removed in 1660 and replaced by a wheel for secret refuge. There was a door with a special rotating horizontal wheel that brought the baby into the building without the parent being seen. This allowed people to leave their babies, anonymously, to be cared for by the orphanage. This system was in operation until the hospital's closure in 1875. Building history The Foundling Hospital was constructed in several phases and only the first phase (1419‚Äì1427) was under Brunelleschi's direct supervision. Under Brunelleschi's supervision he managed to lay the foundations, raise the main walls, finish off the basement with a cryptoporticus beneath the cloister walks, and the lower part of the front facing loggia. Later phases added the attic story (1439), but omitted the pilasters that Brunelleschi seems to have envisioned, and expanded the building by one bay to the south (1430). Colored terracotta medallions by Andrea della Robbia can be seen in the spandrels of the arches, the so-called \\"Infants\\", which were put up in 1485. Despite the popularity today of these medallions, they were not the original intentions of Brunelleschi. If it had been up to Brunelleschi, the medallions would have remained empty. The vaulted passageway in the bay to the left of the loggia was also added later. Since the loggia was started before the hospital was begun, the hospital was not formally opened until 1445.Eugenio Battisti. Filippo Brunelleschi. (New York: Rizzoli, 1981). *See also: Howard Saalman. Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings. (London: Zwemmer, 1993). Design Brunelleschi's design was based on Classical Roman, Italian Romanesque and late Gothic architecture. The loggia was a well known building type, such as the Loggia dei Lanzi. But the use of round columns with classically correct capitals, in this case of the Composite Order, in conjunction with a dosserets (or impost blocks) was novel. So too, the circular arches and the segmented spherical domes behind them. The architectural elements were also all articulated in grey stone and set off against the white of the walls. This motif came to be known as pietra serena (Italian: serene stone). Also novel was the proportional logic. The heights of the columns, for example, was not arbitrary. If a horizontal line is drawn along the tops of the columns, a square is created out of the height of the column and the distance from one column to the next. This desire for regularity and geometric order was to become an important element in Renaissance architecture.Michele Furnari. Formal Design in Renaissance Architecture: from Brunelleschi to Palladio. (New York: Rizzoli, 1995). The Tondi Above each column is a ceramic tondo. These were originally meant by Brunelleschi to be blank concavities, but around 1490 Andrea della Robbia was commissioned to fill them in. The design features a baby in swaddling clothes. A few of the tondi are still the original ones, but some are nineteenth century copies. The insignia of the American Academy of Pediatrics is based on one of the tondi. Piazza Santissima Annunziata The Foundling Hospital defines the eastern side of the Piazza Santissima Annunziata, the other two principal facades of which were built later to imitate Brunelleschi's loggia. The piazza was not designed by Brunelleschi, as is sometimes reported in guide books. The west fa√ßade, the Loggia dei Servi di Maria, was designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Elder in the 1520s. It was built for the mendicant order, the Servi di Maria, but is today a hotel. The north side of the piazza is defined by the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata, the Basilica of the Most Holy Annunciation. Though the building is much older, the facade was added in 1601 by the architect Giovanni Battista Caccini. The equestrian statue of Ferdinand I of Tuscany was made by the noted sculptor Giambologna and placed there in 1608. The fountain was added in 1640. History of the hospital Men's cloister; there was a different one for women. Women's cloister The Ospedale degli Innocenti was a charity institution that was responsible for the welfare of abandoned children. It represented social and humanistic views of Florence during the early Renaissance. It can also explain how investors used Florence's charitable institutions as savings banks: A relationship between charity and Italian city-states can be depicted by using the Innocenti as a case study. Furthermore, the hospital remains as a significant place with a statement of compassion and care besides its unpleasant downfalls. The Innocenti was responsible for the care of abandoned children and provided them with the ability to rejoin society. The first infant abandoned was on February 5, 1445, ten days after opening. Babies were received, wet nursed and weaned. Masters were hired to teach reading and writing to boys. Boys were taught skills according to their abilities. Girls were considered to be the weaker sex, fragile and most vulnerable. They were sent to mistresses who taught them how to sew, cook and other occupations expected for women. The hospital provided dowries for the girls, and they had the option of getting married or become nuns. In the late 1520s, an extension was built to the south along the Via de' Fibbiai. This was intentionally for women who did not marry or become a nun. In 1552, Vincenzo Borghini was appointed spedalingo (superintendent) of the Innocenti. He was employed by Cosimo de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Borghini's education as a Benedictine monk molded the lives of children in the hospital. Borghini, after five months of becoming superintendent, wanted to get hold of the hospital's operai to eliminate wet nurses who defrauded the hospital. One of the main issues was that wet nursing increased the number of pregnancy. Some would resort to feeding the infants with cow or goat's milk. Mothers would sometimes abandon their own children to feed a child from the hospital. Others would even abandon their own children at the Innocenti, get hired as a wet nurse, and end up feeding their own child with pay. There was also continuation of salary from the hospital after the death of an infant. There were three major years of great famine, 1556‚Äì57, 1567 and 1569‚Äì70. This was due to an imbalance between population and agricultural capacity. It was very difficult to reduce cost while balancing high admissions. During the sixteenth century, an increase in population impacted the Innocenti as well as high wheat prices. In 1557, there were also problems with maintaining supplies of grain since flooding occurred in the Innocenti's storehouse. The hospital suffered from financial debt. The main problem was trying to balance expenses and revenues. Cosimo and Francesco had an unstable organization between private charity and finance and constantly over withdrew money. They had used the Innocenti as their personal charitable institution savings banks. The hospital's debt increased from 300,000 to 700,000 lire, however, its annual operating expenses were minimal (100,000 lire). Seventy-five percent of the hospital's debts were amounts owed to investors. The consequences of the debt led to the dismissal of girls and boys. Borghini requested that the children be given to high status people of good reputation. Boys were dismissed at the age of eighteen. Girls were tried to be placed in noble families with increased dowries for those who wanted to marry. Women who did not become nuns nor married were trained for trade and manual labor.  Legacy  According to one scholar (), the building \\"is considered to be the first pure Early Renaissance structure.\\" In E. M. Forster's 1908 novel A Room with a View, Lucy expresses her preference for \\"the Della Robbia babies\\" over Giotto in Chapter 2, and she later purchases several photographs of \\"some Della Robbia Babies\\" in Chapter Four.

McMackin directed over seventy- three films between 1912 and 1916 directing films such as When Empty Hearts Are Filled and The Altar of Ambition in 1915 working with actors such as Harry von Meter, Louise Lester, Vivian Rich and David Lythgoe. His career reached its height in 1916 where in that year alone he directed thirty short films. Early life Archibald Paul McMackin was born in Lake City, Iowa. He had one older brother named Lawrence. His father was Dr. William McMackin and his mother was Mary Isabelle Myers. With the death of MacMackin's father in 1900, the family faced extreme financial hardship. At the age of 12, MacMackin moved in with his maternal grandparent (M.C. Myers), his aunt (Luma Myers), and his bachelor uncle (George Myers) in Salem, Illinois, while Mary set out to establish her eldest son Lawrence in a business. Film career MacMackin got connected to the motion picture studios in Chicago. In 1909 he was in charge of buying new stories for Essanay Studios. He would put advertisements in periodicals directed at writers telling authors what type of stories Essanay was currently purchasing and giving his name and the studio address for the budding authors to send their submissions. In May 1913, a portion of the Essanay film company moved from Chicago to Ithaca, New York ‚Äì among them was MacMackin who was now working as an assistant director. The head of Essanay in Ithaca was Theodore Wharton. Ithaca was chosen because Wharton wanted to make college films and hoped to film at the university. Ithaca was also chosen due to the scenic waterfalls and natural gorges around it which photographed well. A final requirement for early film making was direct sunlight in which to photograph even indoor scenes; this was provided by a glass-domed stadium owned by the college which became the film studio. Francis X. Bushman and Beverly Bayne appeared as the stars in the Essanay films being filmed in Ithaca. David Hargen was the camera operator and Al Tracey was the property manager. MacMackin directed his first film, The 'Lemon', starring Whitney Raymond in 1912. The following year he directed two films including The Way Perilous, and produced four of which he also directed. In 1915, he directed thirty six films, serving as a writer for six. By 1917, MacMackin had directed seventy-four pictures and was working at Edward Small Inc. in New York City where he lived with his family. He worked as a writer on his final film, the 1920 comedy The Rookie's Return, starring Douglas MacLean. Many of his works were connected with Frank Borzage.Book on Franze Borzage, p. 362 Later career During the 1930s, Archer MacMackin took a job with the WPA traveling throughout the United States giving week-long workshops on how to construct marionettes, write scripts, and give puppet shows. Archer also wrote a book about the art of puppetry, Puppetry: Training Course Manual, in 1941 which was published in a mimeographed book which was then bound. Personal life MacMackin divorced his first wife Grace in 1920. In 1930, MacMackin moved to Des Moines, Iowa, and worked as a landscaper. He married his second wife Cora Ida Cushion in 1942. She had three children from a previous marriage that MacMackin helped to raise. During this marriage, MacMackin and his new family lived in Eddyville, Iowa. MacMackin and Cushion divorced in 1955. MacMackin (along with his second wife) later converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He would go on to write a play concerning the Restored Gospel. Death MacMackin died on February 8, 1961, in Des Moines. He and his mother are buried beside each other in the Promise City Cemetery in Wayne County, Iowa.

The Aldrich has no permanent collection and is the only museum in Connecticut that is dedicated solely to the exhibition of contemporary art. The museum presents the first solo museum exhibitions by emerging artists, significant exhibitions of established and mid-career artists whose work is under recognized, thematic group exhibitions exploring topics in contemporary art and society, and newly commissioned work. History The museum building prior to its expansion The Aldrich was founded in 1964 by Larry Aldrich (1906‚Äì2001) with the purpose of being one of the first truly contemporary art museums in the United States. Using money he raised from selling his own art collection (which included works by Picasso, Mir√≥, Chagall, Paul Klee, and others), Mr. Aldrich bought an 18th-century former church and general store known as \\"Old Hundred\\" and converted it into the Larry Aldrich Museum. The museum was originally located in the historic \\"Old Hundred\\" building on Main Street in Ridgefield, Connecticut, constructed in 1783 by Joshua King and James Dole, two lieutenants in the Revolutionary War. During its history the building has served as a grocery and hardware store, a residence, a church, and now houses The Aldrich's administrative offices. The museum, whose original board of trustees included Alfred Barr, Joseph Hirshhorn, Philip Johnson, and Vera List, was renamed The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in 1967. To better focus on its founding mission to exhibit only the very newest art, the museum's board voted in 1981 to deaccession the museum's permanent collection. Mr. Aldrich stayed active and involved with the museum until his death in 2001, shortly prior to which The Aldrich's board of trustees, with their chairman emeritus in attendance, had voted to proceed with a major renovation and expansion. Groundbreaking took place in April 2003, and the galleries reopened to the public in June 2004 with a new name, The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. The new building was designed by architect Charles Mark Hay, design principal at Tapp√© Associates, Boston, and is based on an abstraction of traditional New England architecture. The facility received a design award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Exhibitions The Aldrich Museum features works by national and international emerging and mid-career artists. Larry Aldrich said in a 1986 interview: \\"Almost all the well-known American artists you can think of have been seen here at early stages of their careers. Among them Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Cy Twombly.\\" Additional notable names include: Eva Hesse, Ann Hamilton, Robert Smithson, Jack Whitten, Olafur Eliasson, Huma Bhabha, KAWS, Mark Dion, and Shazia Sikander.

Recent themed exhibition series include Portraiture and Collaborations (2011) and Found (2012). Education The Aldrich Museum has numerous educational programs for adults, teens, children, and families, According to its website, the programs and materials are designed \\"to help people think in new directions by focusing on the process of looking at and analyzing contemporary art with the hope that these skills translate to the everyday lives of our viewers\\". Interior view of the museum's central hall In 1993, former director Harry Philbrick, while director of education, started The Aldrich Museum‚Äôs currently discontinued Student Docent Program. Student Docents from local schools were trained to lead their classmates through the galleries while discussing contemporary art and concepts like structure, content, form, symbolism, abstraction and metaphor. Students also got to see the installation process of the exhibitions on view and meet the artists. In an interview with The New York Times Philbrick said: \\"It begins to get them to think critically about the process‚Äîmaking the work of art and hanging an exhibition. They know there's a real live human being who makes these things, and can relate what they learn to a work of art.\\" The program was adopted by museums across the United States.

Early years and background Prior to entering politics, Hickey was a metal fabricator prior to 1982 and subsequently he was a milk vendor. In 1981 he was elected as a Councillor of the City of Cessnock. Political career He was Minister for Mineral Resources from April 2003 to August 2005, and was Minister for Local Government between 2005 and 2007. On 7 November 2006, he admitted to having been fined four times in recent years for speeding: *$590 in October 2006 for being more than over the limit *$225 in August 2005 for being more than over the limit *$127 in 2003 *$118 in 2002 The Premier, Morris Iemma resisted calls to sack him as result. He was quoted as saying: :I'm disappointed that it happened. Like any other motorist, no one is above the law, whether you are a minister, a member of Parliament or a member of the general public. He has apologised, I've accepted that. Is it a sackable offence? No, but I am very disappointed that it has happened. He's suffering public humiliation as a result. In an interview with the Newcastle Herald, published on 10 July 2010, Hickey claimed that he was not the father of a child born in February 2009 to an unnamed parliamentary staff member. A month later, on further questioning by the media, Hickey admitted that he had lied about his relationship with the parliamentary staff member and admitted that the 18-month-old child was his. In a dramatic day of lying about his relationship, Hickey initially decided to resign, but after speaking with the Premier Kristina Keneally, he issued a statement stating that he would be seeking re-election. Hickey's initial claims were made in order to protect the mother's career and his family. Under mounting political and personal pressure, on 6 September 2010 Hickey announced his decision to not seek re-election at the 2011 state election, citing personal reasons.

It was developed in 2004 by physicist John Skilling. Background Bayes' theorem can be applied to a pair of competing models M_1 and M_2 for data D, one of which may be true (though which one is unknown) but which both cannot be true simultaneously. The posterior probability for M_1 may be calculated as: : \\\\begin{align} P(M_1\\\\mid D) & = \\\\frac{P(D\\\\mid M_1) P(M_1)}{P(D)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{P(D\\\\mid M_1) P(M_1)}{P(D\\\\mid M_1) P(M_1) + P(D\\\\mid M_2) P(M_2)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\frac{P(D\\\\mid M_2)}{P(D\\\\mid M_1)} \\\\frac{P(M_2)}{P(M_1)} } \\\\end{align} Given no a priori information in favor of M_1 or M_2, it is reasonable to assign prior probabilities P(M_1)=P(M_2)=1/2, so that P(M_2)/P(M_1)=1. The remaining Bayes factor P(D\\\\mid M_2)/P(D\\\\mid M_1) is not so easy to evaluate, since in general it requires marginalizing nuisance parameters. Generally, M_1 has a set of parameters that can be grouped together and called \\\\theta, and M_2 has its own vector of parameters that may be of different dimensionality, but is still termed \\\\theta. The marginalization for M_1 is : P(D\\\\mid M_1) = \\\\int d \\\\theta \\\\, P(D\\\\mid \\\\theta,M_1) P(\\\\theta\\\\mid M_1) and likewise for M_2. This integral is often analytically intractable, and in these cases it is necessary to employ a numerical algorithm to find an approximation. The nested sampling algorithm was developed by John Skilling specifically to approximate these marginalization integrals, and it has the added benefit of generating samples from the posterior distribution P(\\\\theta\\\\mid D,M_1). It is an alternative to methods from the Bayesian literature such as bridge sampling and defensive importance sampling. Here is a simple version of the nested sampling algorithm, followed by a description of how it computes the marginal probability density Z=P(D\\\\mid M) where M is M_1 or M_2: Start with N points \\\\theta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\theta_N sampled from prior. for i=1 to j do % The number of iterations j is chosen by guesswork. L_i := \\\\min(current likelihood values of the points); X_i := \\\\exp(-i/N); w_i := X_{i-1} - X_i Z := Z + L_i\\\\cdot w_i; Save the point with least likelihood as a sample point with weight w_i. Update the point with least likelihood with some Markov chain Monte Carlo steps according to the prior, accepting only steps that keep the likelihood above L_i. end return Z; At each iteration, X_i is an estimate of the amount of prior mass covered by the hypervolume in parameter space of all points with likelihood greater than \\\\theta_i. The weight factor w_i is an estimate of the amount of prior mass that lies between two nested hypersurfaces \\\\\\\\{ \\\\theta \\\\mid P(D\\\\mid\\\\theta,M) = P(D\\\\mid\\\\theta_{i-1},M) \\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{ \\\\theta \\\\mid P(D\\\\mid\\\\theta,M) = P(D\\\\mid\\\\theta_i,M) \\\\\\\\}. The update step Z := Z+L_i w_i computes the sum over i of L_i w_i to numerically approximate the integral : \\\\begin{align} P(D\\\\mid M) &= \\\\int P(D\\\\mid \\\\theta,M) P(\\\\theta\\\\mid M) \\\\,d \\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int P(D\\\\mid \\\\theta,M) \\\\,dP(\\\\theta\\\\mid M) \\\\end{align} In the limit j \\\\to \\\\infty, this estimator has a positive bias of order 1 / N which can be removed by using (1 - 1/N) instead of the \\\\exp (-1/N) in the above algorithm. The idea is to subdivide the range of f(\\\\theta) = P(D\\\\mid\\\\theta,M) and estimate, for each interval [f(\\\\theta_{i-1}), f(\\\\theta_i)], how likely it is a priori that a randomly chosen \\\\theta would map to this interval. This can be thought of as a Bayesian's way to numerically implement Lebesgue integration.

Applications Since nested sampling was proposed in 2004, it has been used in many aspects of the field of astronomy. One paper suggested using nested sampling for cosmological model selection and object detection, as it \\"uniquely combines accuracy, general applicability and computational feasibility.\\" A refinement of the algorithm to handle multimodal posteriors has been suggested as a means to detect astronomical objects in extant datasets. Other applications of nested sampling are in the field of finite element updating where the algorithm is used to choose an optimal finite element model, and this was applied to structural dynamics. This sampling method has also been used in the field of materials modeling. It can be used to learn the partition function from statistical mechanics and derive thermodynamic properties. Dynamic nested sampling Dynamic nested sampling is a generalisation of the nested sampling algorithm in which the number of samples taken in different regions of the parameter space is dynamically adjusted to maximise calculation accuracy. This can lead to large improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to the original nested sampling algorithm, in which the allocation of samples cannot be changed and often many samples are taken in regions which have little effect on calculation accuracy. Publicly available dynamic nested sampling software packages include: * dyPolyChord: a software package which can be used with Python, C++ and Fortran likelihood and prior distributions. dyPolyChord is available on GitHub.The dyPolyChord dynamic nested sampling software package on GitHub * dynesty - a Python implementation of dynamic nested sampling which can be downloaded from GitHub.The dynesty nested sampling software package on GitHub Dynamic nested sampling has been applied to a variety of scientific problems, including analysis of gravitational waves, mapping distances in space and exoplanet detection.

It is the result of merging several sections of previously existing roads, autopistas and autov√≠as after the 2004's renaming of primary highways managed by the Generalitat de Catalunya. According to this new denomination, the first number (C-31) indicates that is a southwest-northeast highway (parallel to the Mediterranean Sea coastline), while the second number (C-31) indicates that is the closest to the Mediterranean Sea. The whole path for this highway is split in several points and has some gaps in its path, i.e. has \\"missed sections\\". This is due to either the sections are not constructed yet or either they are managed by the Spanish government and hence not renamed yet. All sections suffer from heavy traffic and are often jammed, specially on working days' mornings and on summer months. Southern section (El Vendrell-South Barcelona) The C-31's southern section has two clearly distinguished subsections: The first corresponds to the former C-246 road, also known as Costes del Garraf. It starts at the intersection with the N-340 at El Vendrell and runs parallel to the Mediterranean Sea coastline passing through several coastal towns such as Calafell, Cubelles (Charlie Rivel's birth town), Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ and Sitges, and across the Garraf Massif coast it finishes at Castelldefels. The second subsection corresponds to the former C-246 autov√≠a, also known as Autovia de Castelldefels. It connects Castelldefels with Barcelona's Gran Via and Pla√ßa d'Espanya passing close to major cities such as El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat and to the Barcelona International Airport. North Barcelona section (North Barcelona-Montgat) This C-31's section corresponds to a part of the former A-19 autopista, also known as Autopista del Maresme, which was the first autopista ever in Spain (1969). It starts at Barcelona's Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries and runs parallel to the coastline passing through the city of Badalona and finishing at the intersection with the B-20 and the C-32, at Montgat. This highway section should continue over the actual N-II, at the comarca of Maresme, but since this road is managed by the Spanish government, it has not been renamed yet. Costa Brava's section (Santa Cristina d'Aro-Figueres) This section corresponds to the former C-253 and C-252 roads. It starts at the end of the Autovia C-65, at Santa Cristina d'Aro and runs parallel to the coastal line (Costa Brava) passing or by-passing the towns of Castell-Platja d'Aro, Palam√≥s, Palafrugell, Pals, Torroella de Montgr√≠, Verges and Viladamat before ending at Figueres.

Anal vibrators differ from other types of vibrators in that they have a flared base to prevent possible loss in the rectum. The average size of an anal vibrator is smaller than vibrators intended for vaginal penetration and may vary from 4-6 inches long and about 1 inch wide. As well as other vibrators designed for external and internal stimulation, anal vibrators are usually battery operated: the batteries may be inside the unit or connected by wire to a power pack. Unlike anal dildos, such as butt plugs, anal probes and anal beads, vibrating anal toys may produce various stimulating effects: rotating, vibrating or pulsating, and can have different speed or vibration levels to regulate and adjust the vibrator to various sensations. Types of anal vibrators * Vibrating anal probes Anal probes, with vibrating effect are smaller than usual butt plugs‚Äìabout the size of a finger, which make them a very helpful anal toy for beginners. Anal probe vibrators may be narrower because their main function is to slide and vibrate. * Vibrating butt plugs Vibrating butt plugs are made to stay inside the anus to create fullness and vibrating stimulation at the same time. Their advantage is that they can be simply left in for anal stimulation during solo or partners' sex to receive multiple enhancements. * Vibrating anal beads and balls Vibrating beads and balls are a number of small beads or balls joined together through a long retrievable cord to a power control.

The first Skyship 600 made its maiden flight on 6 March 1984.. By August 1987 a further six had been built and flown.\\"SkyShip 600\\" Airship Heritage Trust. The Skyship 600 is similar in appearance to, but larger than, the Skyship 500. Airship Industries collapsed in 1990. Westinghouse Electric's defense arm had taken over the US Navy's airship programme in which Airship Industries was a partner and bought the military marketing rights and intellectual rights to the Skyship designs from the official receiver. Slingsby Aviation, which was the principal subcontractor to Airship Industries bought other assets, marketing rights and intellectual property for civil versions along with the type certificates. Westinghouse purchased the Skyship 600S demonstrator, Airship International ‚Äì who were to market the civil design in the Americas ‚Äì bought two unfinished Skyships and Skyship 600-02, and took over the equipment of Airship Industries US arm. The type certificates for the Skyship 600 series was purchased from Westinghouse Airships in 1994 by American company Global Skyship Industries, transferred to Skycruiser Corporation in 2004 and changed hands again in 2012 to Skyship Services.FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet for Skycruiser Skyship 600 Use Most Skyship 600s have been used for advertising purposes, like 600-05 which flew in 2006-7 as \\"Spirit of Dubai\\". A purpose built Skyship was used to promote the Division Bell tour by Pink Floyd in 1994 until the ship's destruction. Pieces of the craft used by Pink Floyd became souvenirs. In December 2007, a Skyship 600 was leased by supporters of US presidential candidate Ron Paul to fly with the banner \\"Who is Ron Paul? Google Ron Paul\\". Others have been used for surveillance purposes, including during the 2004 Summer Olympics. The first Skyship, No 600-01 registered G-SKSC, was used for trials with the French Navy. The 2.2 tonne-payload fifth built (600-05) was sold to a Canadian mining company for aerial survey work. Design The envelope is fabricated from polyester cloth, coated inside with saran film for gas retention and outside with polyurethane loaded with titanium dioxide for durability. The gondola is a kevlar-reinforced moulding, suspended from the top of the envelope by kevlar cables. The pilot controls elevators and rudders on the tail surfaces by fore-aft and lateral movement of a yoke, via a manual, cable-operated system. In response to Airship Industries intent to enter the military market, Marconi did start on a system using fibre optics to carry the control signals to electrical actuators. This could reduce pilot workload, make control response more precise but be resistant to electrical interference.. Skyships are equipped with a pair of ballonets, one forward and one aft comprising a maximum of 27% of the envelope's gross volume. Ballonets are air-filled compartments within an airship that compensate for the expansion and contraction of the helium, thereby maintaining envelope pressure. They can be filled, or partially filled, with air. Emptying of air is done through four valves under the envelope. The valves open automatically as the ship climbs; air is released, the ballonets collapse and the helium expands. During descent, air from the propeller ducts, and/or electric fans is used to inflate the ballonets, and keep the envelope from collapsing. The ballonets can be independently filled by using shut-off dampers in the air supply trunking. Through differential inflation a measure of pitch trim can be obtained. Earlier models were propelled by two Porsche 930 turbocharged piston engines, but some have been modified with Textron Lycoming IO-540 engines. One important feature of this series is thrust-vector control. The ducted propellers can be swivelled in the vertical plane upwards and downwards, providing vertical thrust for use in takeoff, landing and hovering. =Spirit of Dubai ‚Äì The Palm= Spirit of Dubai ‚Äì The Palm was one of three Skyship 600 aircraft operated by Airship Management Services of Greenwich, CT, USA. These ships are now the world's largest currently operating non-rigid airships.the Zeppelin NT is a larger airship, but is a semi-rigid design. The airship, N605SK (s/n 1215-05) was built by Airship Industries in Cardington, UK and first flew as G-SKSJ in November 1986.SkyShip 600 Airship Heritage Trust It is currently owned and operated by Skycruise Switzerland AG. Airship Industries went into administration in 1990 and it was divided up between Slingsby and (for military uses) Westinghouse Corporation. In November 2006, the ship was leased and decorated with new artwork and flown under the name Spirit of Dubai. It was planned to make a publicity tour from London to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The journey was being undertaken to promote a new land development, The Palm Jumeirah in Dubai. The journey was planned to take in landmarks including Big Ben, the London Eye and Tower Bridge in London, Stonehenge and the White Cliffs of Dover in England, the Eiffel Tower and Palace of Versailles in Paris, the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Pisa and the Colosseum in Rome, the Parthenon in Athens, and the Great Pyramids in Egypt. The airship made it to the island of Crete. The next leg of the journey was planned to go through Egypt. However, for reasons unexplained, the Egyptian authorities refused to grant permission for the airship to make the trip. In the spring of 2007 the ship returned to Europe for use in sightseeing. Prior to its departure from London, the aircraft was used for sightseeing tours in Switzerland under its owner/operator company name Skycruise Switzerland. Successor Ten Skyship 600s have been built and a successor, the Skyship 600B, has been planned. Although ATG received two orders for the Skyship 600B, a higher-performance version of the 600, in its early years, it sold the type certificate for the 600 to Julian Benscher of Global Skyship.

Life Buxtorf was born in Basel, where he also died. Before the age of thirteen he matriculated at the University of Basel, and in December 1615 graduated as Master of Arts there. He went to Heidelberg, where he continued his studies under David Pareus, Abraham Scultetus, Johann Heinrich Alting, and others. In 1618 he attended the synod of Dort, where he formed friendships with Simon Episcopius, Ludwig Crocius, and others. He succeeded his late father, in the chair of Hebrew at the university; he gained an almost equal reputation, in the same domain, and was considered a chip off the old block. Although he received offers from Groningen, Leyden, and other places, he preferred to retain his position at Basel. He was four times married, and in his latter years experienced many sorrows. Like his father, Buxtorf maintained relations with several learned Jews. He employed Abraham Braunschweig to purchase Hebrew books for him; and for many years he corresponded with the scholarly Jacob Roman of Constantinople regarding the acquisition of Hebrew manuscripts and rare printed works. Buxtorf was also engaged in the sale of Hebrew books; among his purchasers being the commercial representative of Cardinal Richelieu, Stella de Tery et Morimont, who occasionally sojourned at Basel, and Johann Heinrich Hottinger at Zurich, with whom Buxtorf was on terms of close friendship. He also frequently furnished Hebrew books to the Zurich library. Buxtorf corresponded not only with Jacob Roman and Leon Siau of Constantinople (the latter of whom afterward embraced Christianity and became physician-in-ordinary to a Transylvanian prince), but with the teacher Solomon Gai, and with the friend of the latter, Florio Porto of Mantua, both of whom were commissioned by Buxtorf to purchase Hebrew books in Italy; with the learned rabbi Menahem Zion Porto Cohen of Padua, whom Buxtorf did not treat in a very friendly manner; with Manasseh b. Israel; David Cohen de Lara of Hamburg; Jacob Abendana of Amsterdam, for whose \\"Miklol Yofi\\" he wrote an approbation; Isaac Abendana, brother of the foregoing; Joseph Delmedigo, with whom he was personally acquainted; and many others. Works Buxtorf prepared new editions of several of his father's works [especially the \\"Tiberias\\"]; and, as in the case of the \\"Concordance\\" and the \\"Talmudic-Rabbinical Lexicon,\\" completed and prepared for publication those that had been left unfinished. Nineteen years after the death of his father he became involved in a controversy with Louis Cappel regarding the antiquity of the Hebrew vowel- signs; and although the question was one purely historical, it nevertheless contained a substratum of dogma, and in a number of polemical writings was conducted with great intensity and bitterness on both sides. The following original works of Buxtorf were published: *De Lingu√¶ Hebraic√¶ Origine et Antiquitate (Basel, 1644; not as Herzog, 1643) *Florilegium Hebraicum Continens Elegantes Sentencias, Proverbia, Apophthegmata: ex Optimis Quibusque Maxime vero Priscis Hebr√¶orum Scriptoribus Collectum et . . . Alphabetice Dispositum (Basel, 1648). *Tractatus de punctorum origine, antiquitate, et authoritate, oppositus Arcano puntationis revelato Ludovici Cappelli (1648), defending the authenticity of the vocalization \\"JEHOVAH\\". It was written to defend and elaborate upon a similar book by his father, Johannes Buxtorf Sr., entitled, Tiberias, sive Commentarius Masoreticus (1620 and 1664), arguing against Elias Levita's view of the late origin of the Hebrew vowel points.In Awe of Thy Word, G.A. Riplinger p.434 Especially noteworthy also are Buxtorf's Latin translations of the \\"Moreh\\" of Maimonides, \\"Doctor Perplexorum\\" (Basel, 1629), and the \\"Cuzari\\" of Judah ha-Levi, \\"Liber Cosri\\" (Basel, 1660). Buxtorf also wrote a long series of dissertations on the writings of Abravanel, among which may be mentioned \\"De Sive de Excitii Poena,\\" \\"De Longa Vita Primorum Parentum,\\" \\"De Statu et Jure Regio,\\" \\"De Mosis Nomine.\\" All these first appeared singly, and then either as \\"Dissertaciones Philologo-Theologic√¶\\" (Basel, 1662), or in Ugolino's \\"Thesaurus\\" (xxv.); while several others, such as \\"De Lepra Vestimentorum et √Üdium,\\" \\"De Poesi Veteri Hebraica in Libris Sacris Usitata,\\" \\"De Principio Anni,\\" etc., were appended to the translation of the \\"Cuzari.\\" Bibliography *Revue Etudes Juives, viii.74-95, xiii.260-276.

She remains the only woman ever executed in South Australia and is buried between the outer and inner prison walls. It has been argued that she may have been a victim of domestic violence and suffered from battered spouse syndrome.The information in this article comes from the book \\"Dead Woman Walking\\" detailing the research of Allan Peters, the South Australian Police Historical Societies historian. Life Born 20 April 1848, Elizabeth and her family lived in Burra Burra in South Australia. In January 1852, Elizabeth's father joined the Victorian gold rush and the family moved to Ballarat, taking residence in a tent on the goldfields. At the age of four years Elizabeth's mother moved to Adelaide leaving Elizabeth to be raised by her father. In 1855 seven-year-old Elizabeth was raped and left for dead by an itinerant Indian. Two years later her father died of consumption. In 1865 after receiving news that her mother was alive and looking for her, Elizabeth travelled to Moonta in South Australia and moved in with her mother and stepfather. She taught Sunday school at the Wesleyan Church. Thomas Woolcock Thomas Woolcock emigrated from Cornwall and settled in Moonta with his wife and two children in 1865. His wife and one son contracted a fever and died the following year. Widowed and with a young son also named Thomas to care for he took on Elizabeth as a housekeeper. Elizabeth's stepfather disliked Woolcock and heard rumours that there was more than a work relationship between them and threatened to cripple Elizabeth if she continued seeing him. Woolcock, to avoid gossip married her in the cottage's front parlour.Since the trial, the area surrounding Thomas Woolcock's cottage has been known locally as \\"Poison Flats\\". The cottage has been restored by its current owner and occupant and apart from minor changes the cottage has remained much as it was in the 1870s. The cottage has had a reputation for being haunted since Woolcock's death, however the current owner has never experienced anything out of the ordinary and has named the cottage \\"Serenity\\". Woolcock turned out to be a heavy drinker, a bully and a wife- beater. Elizabeth attempted to leave him several times but he continued to find her and bring her back to Moonta. Depressed and feeling alone, since her mother and stepfather moved to Adelaide, Elizabeth attempted suicide. She was given Morphine to help with insomnia and melancholy. The situation improved somewhat when Woolcock took in a boarder whose presence lessened the abuse she suffered but eventually the two men had a dispute and the boarder left. Not long after he left, the family dog died after being poisoned and Thomas suspected the boarder and reported him to the Police. Around this time Elizabeth was seeking medication, mainly morphine, for her ailments but the chemist refused to prescribe any and she resorted to sending her stepson to pharmacies with notes. She visited a chemist, claiming she needed morphine to \\"get ink stains out of a skirt\\" then claimed it was for scurf in her hair. Her desperation to acquire drugs became common knowledge in the community. Woolcock's death A month after the dog died, Woolcock became ill with stomach pains and nausea, Elizabeth called in three doctors over the following weeks who each diagnosed different illnesses and prescribed different medications. Dr Bull prescribed syrup and pills laced with a third of a grain of Mercury each (21 mg), for a sore throat but Woolcock became considerably worse and Elizabeth then called in Dr Dickie who diagnosed a gastric disorder and prescribed Rhubarb tablets and cream of tartar which had no effect. Finally Dr Herbert treated him for excessive 'Salivation by Mercury'. Dr Herbert's treatment worked and Woolcock was improving but two weeks later he could no longer afford Dr Herbert's fees so returned to Dr Dickie who resumed the treatment for a gastric problem. When his condition failed to improve Elizabeth suggested returning to Dr Bull but, according to neighbors and friends who were present and later testified at her trial, Woolcock replied: \\"I certainly don't want Dr Bull again, as it was his medicine that made me bad in the first place\\". At 3 am on 4 September 1873, Thomas Woolcock died. Dr Dickie initially stated his patient had died from \\"pure exhaustion from excessive and prolonged vomiting and purging\\". Woolcock's cousin, Elizabeth Snell, suggested to the doctor that as everyone knew Woolcock's wife had been getting \\"Morphia\\" she could have poisoned him with it and rumours of foul play began spreading. An inquest was ordered. =Inquest and trial= The inquest was opened in the front parlour of Woolcock's cottage. Dr Dickie testified on the drugs taken by the deceased and the chemist, Mr Opie, testified regarding Elizabeth's attempts to get Morphine. Elizabeth stated she had nothing to gain from her husband's death. An autopsy was ordered and performed in the cottage that day while Elizabeth waited outside. The next day the inquest resumed at the Moonta courthouse where Dr Dickie described the state of the body and suggested that mercury poisoning was a strong probability, Dr Herbert concurred. Dr Bull admitted prescribing pills with mercury but insisted Woolcock only took one. Police told the inquest that they had exhumed the Woolcock's dead dog and found the body too contained large traces of mercury (which was a known treatment for Ringworm). Several jars considered 'poison' were found in the cottage and the jury decided that Woolcock was poisoned by his wife and Elizabeth was arrested. Elizabeth pleaded not guilty and the trial in Adelaide was a sensation with crowds filling Gouger Street outside the Supreme Court. Elizabeth was provided with an inexperienced lawyer who failed in court against the accomplished Crown Solicitor, Richard Bullock Andrews QC, who argued that Elizabeth had poisoned the dog as an experiment, the ringworm powder was the means and that motive was an affair with the boarder. Defendants at this time were barred from testifying on their own behalf so Elizabeth was unable to answer the accusations. Following a three- day trial the jury, after deliberating for 20 minutes, found her guilty with a recommendation for mercy on account of her youth. The plea for mercy was declined by Governor Anthony Musgrave and she was sentenced to death. =Execution and confession= On 30 December 1873, dressed in a white frock and carrying a posie of fresh flowers, Elizabeth gave a letter to be opened after her death to her minister, the Reverend James Bickford, and then walked calmly to the gallows. The letter, describing her life, was badly written with poor spelling and inaccuracies including even getting her own age wrong: > The last Statement and confession of Elizabeth Woolcock to Mr. Bickford. > Sir I was Born in the Burra mine in Provence of South Australia in the year > 1847 my parents names were John and Elisabeth Oliver they were Cornish they > came to this Couleney in 1842 but they went to Victoria in 1851.

Evidence of innocence Experts agree that Elizabeth's \\"confession\\" was religiously inspired and prompted by a desire for salvation with an exaggeration of her sins. Police historian Allan Peters says she was \\"more interested in impressing the Reverend than setting the record straight\\". It is unlikely that Elizabeth was having an affair and she had nothing to gain from Woolcock's death.Although suffering from domestic violence and possibly battered spouse syndrome the mores of the day, no income and a stepson to care for would have meant her enduring a more difficult life as a widow. That she cared for him while he was ill was evidenced by his lack of bed sores and witnesses testified that Elizabeth showed no ill will towards her husband. The dog was treated for Ringworm with Mercury laced powder and could have died from Mercury poisoning after licking the powder on its body. Woolcock's symptoms were consistent with Tuberculosis and Dysentery, both of which were found at autopsy, and Typhoid, although this was not found. Woolcock's organs, removed at autopsy, had been left unattended and exposed to the air for 24 hours before they were examined which could have compromised the diagnosis. It was never proven at trial that Woolcock had died of Mercury poisoning or that Elizabeth had administered it. Dr Bull prescribed Mercury laced syrup and tablets which would have killed Woolcock if he had taken more than Bull testified to. Bull had been a drug addict himself for 30 years and consumed Atropine, Sulphuric Ether, Chloroform and Opium in large and frequent doses. He was reportedly in a \\"drug be-fuddled state\\" when treating Woolcock and several witnesses testified that Thomas has told them that it was Bull's medicine that had made him so sick. Dr Bull was committed to a psychiatric hospital after the trial and committed suicide several months later. Two recently discovered letters sent by Samuel Way to relatives in England shortly before he was appointed Chief Justice of South Australia were commentary on the now lost report into the hanging commissioned by the government of the day and headed by his brother Dr Edward Way. Edward he wrote, concurred with the analytical chemist that the evidence on administration of the poison was \\"unreliable\\" and that the \\"medical evidence mistaken\\". The implication is that she did not poison Woolcock and that even if she had been guilty she did not receive justice based on the available evidence. =Application for posthumous pardon= After 30 years of research, Police historian Allan Peters in January 2009 applied to the State Attorney general Michael Atkinson for a Posthumous Pardon. In 2010, Peters together with daughter Leeza, distributed petitions throughout the Copper Coast and online, urging people to sign and support a posthumous pardon for Elizabeth.Petition for Posthumous Pardon for Elizabeth Woolcock What's On Moonta Moonta and District Progress Association 26 October 2010Petition for posthumous pardon Yorke Peninsula Country Times 28 September 2010 The signed petitions along with detailed documentation and evidence was delivered to the Governor of South Australia Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce on 28 September 2011.

The series ran for one season with 13 episodes produced, but only 6 episodes were aired by The WB before the series was cancelled. Plot The premise of the series was that the three members of the fictional band named The Problem find, and are unable to rid themselves of, a magical amulet that allows them to see and communicate with ghosts. Each episode featured the trio reluctantly completing the unfinished business of the ghosts that they encounter in order to allow the ghosts move on to the next world. Much of the humor of the series came from The Problem wanting to develop their career instead of helping ghosts, and that the trio almost invariably are viewed as, at best, mentally unbalanced by those who cannot see or hear ghosts. Episodes Broadcast All 13 episodes were aired in Canada on YTV with its first run between September 15 and December 8, 2001. The entire series was often shown on the Trouble channel in the UK.

Mountain rescue services in England and Wales operate under the association of Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MREW), formerly called Mountain Rescue Council of England & Wales. The association has a number of regional mountain rescue teams, each of which is an independent charity. The team members are highly trained volunteers who are called out by the police. MREW is a member of the International Commission for Mountain Rescue (Internationale Kommission f√ºr Alpines Rettungswesen (IKAR- CISA)). Overview The Battenburg markings used by mountain rescue Voluntary mountain rescue teams in England and Wales are independent charities whose members are highly trained volunteers who are called out by the police. The police are legally responsible for land based search and rescue but generally lack the resources to discharge this function effectively. Individual teams are normally known as an MRT (mountain rescue team) but some use the term SRT (search and rescue team) or MS&RT; (mountain search and rescue team). Individual teams are members both of the MREW and of their regional association (which is also represented at MREW). Neither MREW nor the regional associations have authority over the individual teams but provide an opportunity to discuss and agree standards, training and equipment. MREW does provide some equipment funding for MRTs both from its own funds and via a small government grant, but teams have to finance their own running costs through charity fund-raising or sponsorship. MRTs in England and Wales receive no direct government funding. The government provides access by teams to Ordnance Survey mapping. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service has three teams ‚Äì one in Scotland, one in England and one in Wales ‚Äì and as part of the military is wholly government funded. They have primary responsibility for aircraft crashes on high ground, but also respond to civilian calls for assistance from hikers and climbers. Although the primary focus of mountain rescue is to locate and evacuate injured and/or lost persons in upland environments, teams also undertake a wide range of roles which may differ from team to team: * missing person searches in lowland areas where access or terrain is difficult; * support to NHS ambulance services for difficult casualty evacuation; * support to government agencies/emergency services in flood and heavy snowfall; * support to government agencies/emergency services at major incidents; * swift water rescue; * animal rescue. Urban search and rescue is currently undertaken by the fire and rescue services as part of their statutory enablement, but at least one mountain rescue team has chosen to train in this field. Each team has its own primary area of responsibility but frequently deploy outside these areas in support of other teams. Cave rescue has its own umbrella organisation, the British Cave Rescue Council, but some teams operate as both cave rescue teams and mountain rescue teams. There are also regional organisations dedicated to the training of search dogs and their handlers. England has two associations, the Search and Rescue Dog Association England SARDA(E) and the Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dog Association (LDMRSD). Wales also has two associations the Search and Rescue Dog Association Wales (SARDA Wales) responding to incidents in North Wales and the Search and Rescue Dog Association South Wales (SARDA South Wales).

It is the last and second most important tributary of the Ogoou√© River, the first being the Ivindo River. It initially flows down from the Chaillu Mountains, along the border with Congo, and then turns northwest, flowing through the towns of Fougamou, Sindara and Mouila before flowing into the Ogoou√©. Etymology The river name, Ngouni√©, is a French rewording of \\"Ngugni\\", which was originally used by Vili language speakers in the Samba Falls/Imperatrice Falls area in the mid-1800s to call the northern border of their district, \\"Nsina-Ngugni\\". When Robert Bruce Napoleon Walker and Paul Du Chaillu arrived in the area, they wrote down \\"Ngouyai\\" or \\"Nguny√©\\". The Gisir and Punu language speakers of Gabon know the river as \\"Durembu-du-Manga\\", while the Apindji, Eviya and Tsogo speakers know it as Otembo-a-Manga. The Kele speakers know it as \\"Melembye-a-Manga\\". The first part of these names means \\"body of water\\" in the given languages, and \\"manga\\" refers to dwarf palm trees which grow along its bank. Geography Ngouni√© River The Ngouni√© River, with a basin area of about , is the second largest tributary of the Ogoou√© River. It rises in the Chaillu Mountains. For , the river has a south and then west flow, and forms a border with Congo. At the Polo River confluence, it changes direction, heading northwest, before passing through three waterfalls. It then establishes a floodplain within a valley between the Moukande Mountains and the Massif due Chaillu. After meandering for more than on the valley floor, it joins the Ogoou√© prior to Lambar√©n√©. Development in the floodplain occurs mostly in the areas between Lebamba and Mouila, and again from the Fougamou area to the Ogoou√© at Lambarene. Conservatively, the estimated valley flood land area is approximately . The left bank is characterized by sandy clay soils. The Ngouni√© River Valley is formed between the forest-covered Du Chaillu Hills and the Ikoundou Mountains, and has grassy vegetation. The region within this valley is also known as Ngouni√©. Its tributaries include Louetsi√©, which passes through Lebamba and Mbigou; Ikoy, whose main tributary are the Ikobe River and the Oumba River; Doll√©, which passes through Ndend√©; as well as the Ogoulou, Ngongo and Ovigui rivers. Imperatrice Falls (also known as Samba Falls, or Empress Eug√©nie Falls), are approximately in height. They are located in a river bend in the Ngouni√© Province, from Fougamou. Here, the Ngouni√© measures approximately in width and contains small islands. This is within the Peneplain Chaillu, which features granite gneiss and hills as well as rocky bays. Climate The climate is characterized by its equatorial humidity. The average temperature varies between . The relative humidity is commonly greater than 80%. Annual rainfall is measured around . Wet seasons occur during September‚ÄìDecember and March‚ÄìMay. Power development The hydro-power potential of the Ngouni√© River has been proposed to be tapped by a hydroelectric project located on the Empress Eug√©nie Falls. The project is planned as a 56 MW run-of-the-river scheme with four units 14 MW capacity each. Two additional units of 14 MW have also been planned for completion in 2015, thus taking the total installed capacity of the station to 84 MW. The project utilizes the main Empress Eug√©nie waterfall of about and a series of rapids in a river length of , creating a total head of for power generation.

The Ottoman rule was scattered and covered mostly the southern territories of the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary, namely almost the entire region of the Great Hungarian Plain (except the northeastern parts) and Southern Transdanubia. History The political situation around 1572: The Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (Royal Hungary), Principality of Transylvania, and Ottoman eyalets The political situation around 1683: The Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (Royal Hungary), Imre Th√∂k√∂ly's Principality of Upper Hungary (existed between 1682-1685), Principality of Transylvania, and Ottoman eyalets (Budin Eyalet, Varat Eyalet, Eƒüri Eyalet, Teme≈üvar Eyalet, Kanije Eyalet, Uyvar Eyalet) The 1881 map of Hungary showing the boundaries of the almost completely destroyed Hungarian settlement areas during the Ottoman occupation of Hungary By the sixteenth century, the power of the Ottoman Empire had increased gradually, as did the territory controlled by them in the Balkans, while the Kingdom of Hungary was weakened by the peasants' uprisings. Under the reign of Louis II Jagiellon (1516‚Äì1526), internal dissentions divided the nobility. Instigating war by feigned diplomatic insult, Suleiman the Magnificent (1520‚Äì1566) attacked the Kingdom of Hungary and captured Belgrade in 1521. He did not hesitate to launch an attack against the weakened kingdom, whose smaller, badly led army (approximately 26,000 Hungarian soldiers compared to 45,000 Ottoman soldiers) was defeated on 29 August 1526 at the Battle of Moh√°cs. Thus he became influential in the Kingdom of Hungary, while his semi-vassal, named John Z√°polya, and his enemy Ferdinand I both claimed the throne of the Kingdom. Suleiman went further and tried to crush Austrian forces, but his Siege of Vienna in 1529 failed after the onset of winter forced his retreat. The title of king of Hungary was disputed between Z√°polya and Ferdinand until 1540. After the seizure of Buda by the Ottomans in 1541,Melvin E. Page, Colonialism: an international social, cultural, and political encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2003, p. 648 the West and North recognized a Habsburg as king (\\"Royal Hungary\\"), while the central and southern counties were annexed by the Ottoman Sultan and the east was ruled by the son of Z√°polya under the name Eastern Hungarian Kingdom which after 1570 became the Principality of Transylvania. Whereas a great many of the 17,000 and 19,000 Ottoman soldiers in service in the Ottoman fortresses in the territory of present-day Hungary were Orthodox and Muslim Balkan Slavs, Southern Slavs were also acting as akƒ±ncƒ±s and other light troops intended for pillaging in the territory of present-day Hungary.Inalcik Halil: \\"The Ottoman Empire\\" Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary In these times, territory of present-day Hungary began to undergo changes due to the Ottoman occupation. Vast lands remained unpopulated and covered with woods. Flood plains became marshes. The life of the inhabitants on the Ottoman side was unsafe. Peasants fled to the woods and marshes, forming guerrilla bands, known as the Hajd√∫ troops. Eventually, the territory of present-day Hungary became a drain on the Ottoman Empire, swallowing much of its revenue into the maintenance of a long chain of border forts. However, some parts of the economy flourished. In the huge unpopulated areas, townships bred cattle that were herded to south Germany and northern Italy - in some years they exported 500,000 head of cattle. Wine was traded to the Czech lands, Austria and Poland.http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/hunspir/hsp25.htm The defeat of Ottoman forces led by Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha at the Second Siege of Vienna in 1683, at the hands of the combined armies of Poland and the Holy Roman Empire under John III Sobieski, was the decisive event that swung the balance of power in the region. Under the terms of the Treaty of Karlowitz, which ended the Great Turkish War in 1699, the Ottomans ceded to Habsburgs much of the territory they had previously taken from the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Following this treaty, the members of the Habsburg dynasty administered a much enlarged Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (previously they controlled only area known as \\"Royal Hungary\\"; see Kingdom of Hungary (1526‚Äì1867)). In the 1540s the total of the four principal fortresses of Buda (2,965), Pest (1,481), Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r (2,978) and Esztergom (2,775) were 10,200 troops.Ottoman Warfare 1500-1700, Rhoads Murphey, 1999, p.227 The number of Ottoman garrison troops stationed in Ottoman Hungary vary, but during the peak period in the mid-16th century it rose to between 20,000 and 22,000 men. As a force of occupation for a country the size of Hungary, even confined to central portions it was a rather low-profile military presence in much of the country and a relatively large proportion of it was concentrated in a few key fortresses.Ottoman Warfare 1500‚Äì1700, Rhoads Murphey, 1999, p.56 In 1640 when the front remained relatively quiet, 8,000 Janissary supported by an undocumented number of local recruits was sufficient to garrison the whole of the Eyalet of Budin. Administration Ottoman soldiers besiege Estolnibelgrad (probably Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r) in Hungary. The territory was divided into Eyalets (provinces), which were further divided into Sanjaks, with the highest ranking Ottoman official being the Pasha of Budin. At first, Ottoman- controlled territories in present-day Hungary were part of the Budin Eyalet. Later, new eyalets were formed: Teme≈üvar Eyalet, Zigetvar Eyalet, Kanije Eyalet, Eƒüri Eyalet, and Varat Eyalet. Administrative centers of Budin, Zigetvar, Kanije and Egir eyalets were located in the territory of present-day Hungary, while Teme≈üvar and Varat eyalets that had their administrative centers in the territory of present-day Romania also included some parts of present-day Hungary. Pashas and Sanjak-Beys were responsible for administration, jurisdiction and defense. The Ottomans' only interest was to secure their hold on the territory. The Sublime Porte (Ottoman rulers) became the sole landowner and managed about 20 percent of the land for its own benefit, apportioning the rest among soldiers and civil servants. The Ottoman landlords were interested mainly in squeezing as much wealth from the land as quickly as possible. Of major importance to the Sublime Porte was the collection of taxes. Taxation left little for the former landlords to collect; Most of the nobility and large numbers of burghers emigrated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (\\"Royal Hungary\\") province. Wars, slave-taking, and the emigration of nobles who lost their land caused a depopulation of the countryside. However, the Ottomans practiced relative religious tolerance and allowed the various ethnicities living within the empire significant autonomy in internal affairs. Towns maintained some self-government, and a prosperous middle class developed through artisanry and trade. At least one ethnic Hungarian became Grand Vizier, the highest governmental office in the Ottoman Empire: Hadƒ±m S√ºleyman Pasha. Ethnic changes during the Ottoman rule As a consequence of the 150 years of constant warfare between the Christian states and Ottomans, population growth was stunted, and the network of ethnic Hungarian medieval settlements, with their urbanized bourgeois inhabitants, perished. The ethnic composition of the territory that had been part of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary was fundamentally changed through deportations and massacres, so that the number of ethnic Hungarians in existence at the end of the Ottoman period was substantially diminished. The economic decline of Buda the capital city during the Ottoman conquest characterized by the stagnation of population. The population of Buda was not larger in 1686 than two centuries earlier in the 15th century. The Ottomans allowed the Hungarian royal palace to fall into ruins. The Ottomans later transformed the palace into a gunpowder store and magazine, which caused its detonation during the siege in 1686. The Christian Hungarian population significantly shrank in the next decades, due to them fleeing to the Habsburg-ruled Royal Hungary. The number of Jewish and Gypsy immigrants became dominant during the Ottoman rule in Buda. Holy League took Buda after a long siege in 1686 The Hungarian inhabitants of cities moved to other places when they felt threatened by the Ottoman military presence. Without exception, in the cities that became Ottoman administrative centers the Christian population decreased. The Hungarian population remained only in some cities, where the Ottoman garrisons were not installed. From the early 17th century, Serbian refugees were the ethnic majority in large parts of Ottoman-controlled Hungary. That area included territories between the great rivers Sava, Drava, and the Danube‚ÄìTisza Interfluve (the territory between the Danube and Tisza rivers). According to modern estimations, the proportion of Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin was around 80% at the end of the 15th century, and non- Hungarians hardly were more than 20% to 25% of the total population.Hungary. (2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 11 May 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica OnlineHistorical World Atlas. With the commendation of the Royal Geographical Society. Carthographia, Budapest, Hungary, 2005. CM The Hungarian population began to decrease at the time of the Ottoman conquest, The decline of the Hungarians was due to the constant wars, Ottoman raids, famines, and plagues during the 150 years of Ottoman rule. The main zones of war were the territories inhabited by the Hungarians, so the death toll depleted them much faster than other nationalities. The three parts of Hungary; the Habsburg Hungary, Ottoman Hungary and Transylvania, experienced only minor differences in population increase in the 17th century.Ottoman Warfare 1500‚Äì1700, Rhoads Murphey, 1999, p.173-174 ≈± =Immigration= According to data presented in the most authoritative studies, the collective population of all three regions grew from about 3.5 million inhabitants at the close of the 16th century to about 4 million by the close of the 17th century. This increase was before the immigration to Hungary from other parts of the Habsburg Empire.Ottoman Warfare 1500‚Äì1700, Rhoads Murphey, 1999, p.254 The Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars of the 17th century were fought intermittently and affected populations occupying a much narrower band of territory. Thus wartime dislocations in Hungary do not seem to have seriously affected mortality rates among the general civilian population. The breakdown of social order and other economic links between contiguous regions that is associated with prolonged warfare of the medieval pattern was largely absent in Ottoman warfare of the 17th century. The most severe destructions were experienced during the Hungarian time of troubles, when between 1604 and 1606 the worst effects of the controlled confrontation between Ottoman-Habsburg forces were magnified many times over by Hungary's descent into civil war during the Bocskay rebellion. Hungary's population in the late 16th century was in Ottoman Hungary 900,000, in Habsburg Hungary 1,800,000 and 'free' (Transylvania) Hungary 800,000, making a total of 3,500,000 inhabitants for the whole of Hungary. The population growth in Ottoman Hungary during the 17th century was slight: from 900,000 to approximately 1,000,000 inhabitants, a rate similar to that experienced in Royal Hungary and Transylvania. Culture Despite the continuous warfare with the Habsburgs, several cultural centres sprang up in this far northern corner of the Empire. Examples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, seen in the famous centres of Constantinople and Edirne, were also seen in the territory of present-day southern Hungary, where mosques, bridges, fountains, baths and schools were built. After the Habsburg reclamation, most of these works were destroyed and few survive to this day. The introduction of Turkish baths, with the building of the Rudas Baths, was the beginning of a long tradition in the territory of present-day Hungary. No less than 75 hammams (steam baths) were built during the Ottoman age. =Muslim schools= In the seventeenth century, 165 elementary (mekteb) and 77 secondary and academic theological schools (medrese) were operating in 39 of the major towns of the region. The elementary schools taught writing, basic arithmetics, and the reading of the Koran and of the most important prayers. The medreses carried out secondary and academic training within the fields of Muslim religious sciences, church law and natural sciences. Most medreses operated in Budin (Buda), where there were twelve. In Pe√ßuy (P√©cs) there were five medreses, Eƒüri had four. The most famous medrese in Ottoman-controlled territory of present-day Hungary was that of Budin (Buda), built by the Serb Mehmed-pasha Sokoloviƒá during his seventeen years of governing (1566‚Äì1578). In the mosques, people not only prayed, but were taught to read and write, to read the Koran, and prayers. The sermons were the most effective form of political education. There were numerous elementary and secondary schools besides the mosques, and the monasteries of the Dervish orders also served as centers of culture and education. The spread of culture was supported by the libraries. The school library of Mehmed-pasha Sokoloviƒá in Budin (Buda), contained, besides Muslim religious sciences, other literature, works on oratory, poetry, astronomy, music, architecture, and medical sciences. =Religion= The mosque of Pasha Qasim in P√©cs, now used as a Catholic church Minaret of Eger The Ottomans practiced relative religious tolerance, and Christianity was not prohibited. Islam was not spread by force in the areas under the control of the Ottoman Sultan,The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 135-144 however, Arnold concludes by quoting a 17th-century author who stated: > Meanwhile he [the Turk] wins [converts] by craft more than by force, and > snatches away Christ by fraud out of the hearts of men. For the Turk, it is > true, at the present time compels no country by violence to apostatise; but > he uses other means whereby imperceptibly he roots out Christianity...The > preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir > Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 136 The relative religious tolerance of the Ottomans enabled Protestantism in Hungary (such as the Reformed Church in Hungary) to survive against the oppression of the Catholic Habsburg-ruled Hungarian domains. There were approximately 80,000 Muslim settlers in Ottoman-controlled territory of present-day Hungary; being mainly administrators, soldiers, artisans and merchants of Crimean Tatar origin. The religious life of the Muslims was supervised by the mosques that were either newly built or transformed from older Christian churches. Payment for the servants of the mosques, as well as the maintenance of the churches, was the responsibility of the Ottoman state or charities. Besides Sunni Islam, a number of dervish communities also flourished including the bektashis, the halvetis, and the mevlevis. The famous G√ºl Baba monastery of Budin (Buda), sheltering 60 dervishes, belonged to the bektasi order. Situated close to the janissaries camp, it was built by Jahjapasaz√°de Mehmed Pasha, the third begler bey (governor) of Budin. Gul Baba's tomb (t√ºrbe) is to this day the northernmost site of Islamic conquest.Christina Shea, Joseph S. Lieber, Erzs√©bet Bar√°t, Frommer's Budapest & the Best of Hungary, John Wiley and Sons, 2004, p 122-123 Another famous monastery of its time was that of the halveti dervishes. Built around 1576 next to the t√ºrbe of Sultan S√ºleyman I the Magnificent (1520‚Äì1566) in Sigetvar (Szigetv√°r), it soon became the religious and cultural centre of the area. A famous prior of the zavije (monastery) was the Bosnian ≈†ejh Ali Dede. The monastery of Jakovali Hasan Pa≈°a in Pe√ßuy (P√©cs) was another famous location. Its most outstanding prior was Mevlevian dervish Pe√ßevi Arifi Ahmed Dede, a Turk and native of Pe√ßuy. By the end of the sixteenth century, around 90% of the inhabitants of Ottoman Hungary were Protestant, most of them being Calvinist.

It was originally transmitted on 23 October 1977.http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/dadsarmy/list.html phill.co.uk episode list Synopsis Frazer gleefully counts up his profits for the week as he plans to use most of it to invest in more gold sovereigns, many of which he keeps in a box. Doctor Macavity unexpectedly drops in to inform Frazer that one of his patients will soon need Frazer's services (i.e. he has died) and accidentally knocks over the box, revealing Frazer's secret stash. Doctor Macavity informs Mainwaring of Frazer's hoard at the bank the next day, worried that any theft or loss of the gold would have devastating effects on Frazer's health. Mainwaring agrees that Frazer should not keep the sovereigns in his house and resolves to convince the stingy Scotsman to sell them and buy an annuity at the bank (furiously denouncing Wilson's suggestion that Mainwaring is motivated by the fact that he, as bank manager, would profit from this). Deciding to raise the matter subtly, Mainwaring gives the whole platoon a lecture about how they should keep their money and valuables in the bank, again insisting that any profit for him is not part of the issue. Unfortunately, Frazer sees through Mainwaring's hints and rushes off, vowing he will never let anyone, least of all Mainwaring, get his gold. Word of Frazer's hidden wealth soon spreads and is discussed at length in Hodges' grocer shop by Hodges, Verger Yateman and Vicar Farthing (who wants to persuade Frazer to donate towards restoring the church). Frazer then misses parade, prompting the platoon to go looking for him (as this involves going to several pubs, Wilson ends up severely drunk) - after they come back unsuccessful, Frazer defiantly phones Mainwaring, saying he will hide the sovereigns where nobody will ever find them. Inspired by Pike remembering a film about a miser who buried his gold, Mainwaring assigns some of the platoon to stake out Frazer's house, certain he will do it that night. Much later, Frazer is spotted leaving his house by both the platoon and Hodges (who's out on air raid patrol). Followed secretly by the platoon, Frazer buries the box in the local graveyard. After he leaves, Mainwaring and the others dig up the box and attempt to break it open, only to be caught by the Vicar, the Verger and Hodges (who also followed Frazer), who insists their actions are illegal. Mainwaring agrees to settle the matter the next day. At the Home Guard parade the next day, Mainwaring convinces Frazer to give him the key to the box, lecturing him that the ease with which they found the box proves that Frazer is better off entrusting his sovereigns to the bank (although Mainwaring also reluctantly agrees to let the Vicar take a small donation). When Mainwaring unlocks the box though, it turns out to contain a brick, revealing that Frazer hid his hoard elsewhere. Frazer mockingly suggests that the Vicar accept the brick as a donation and runs from the room, vowing to the last that Mainwaring will never get his gold.

This does not go down well with Hodges and his ARP wardens, however, as they have been planning the same thing. Plot At the town meeting, the council are trying to organise the events that will take place in order to celebrate Saint George's Day. After a vote, it is decided that the Home Guard and the ARP will share the grand finale. Both Mainwaring and Hodges are reluctant to reveal what they each will be doing for the event. Later that day, Mainwaring is in his office with Wilson and Pike. Mainwaring tells them of his plan to celebrate St. George's Day by staging a fight between St. George and a dragon, representing Britain's fight against Hitler. Mainwaring reveals that he will be playing St. George. During the rehearsal of the fight, Mainwaring is finding it quite difficult to manoeuver in a real suit of armour, but is persistent stating \\"that if out ancestors could wear it, so can I\\". After falling off the horse a number of times, he eventually gives up and agrees to let Godfrey's sister knit him a suit of armour. Meanwhile Pike is told to dress up as a Squander Bug using a costume his mother made him, but finally gets out of this and becomes a herald instead. As the platoon are about to get their staged fight underway, the ARP interrupt them, as they too are staging the fight between St. George and the dragon, with Hodges as St. George. As things take a turn for the worse, Hodges challenges Mainwaring to a duel, which he accepts. The two dragons also face off, with Jones at the head of one and the Vicar at the head of the other. Wilson tells Pike that they \\"ought to do something\\" and with that, Pike shoots Hodges' horse in the backside with his herald's trumpet/pea-shooter, causing it to rear up and throw Hodges off. The Home Guard dragon eventually defeats the ARP dragon, and Mainwaring salutes the cheering crowd from his horse. Notes #The episode references the legend of St George and the Dragon. However it throws a peculiar twist on it by having St George fight St George and the dragon fight the dragon.

It was originally transmitted on 2 October 1977. In this episode, longtime rivals Captain Mainwaring and ARP Warden Hodges join forces to give the townsfolk a fright.  Plot  It is now a few years into the war, and after being told to 'keep the noise down' during firing practice, Mainwaring and Wilson discuss how Complacency is setting in amongst the townsfolk, and how people are seeing them as 'Geriactric Fusiliers'. As they discuss it, they are interrupted by ARP Warden Hodges who is in tears after Mr Blewitt verbally attacked him for trying to do his job, and how people don't seem to be taking the war seriously. Remembering the national reaction after the Platoon were recently mistaken for enemy agents during a training exercise (see Ring Dem Bells), Mainwaring decides to get his platoon to masquerade as fifth columnists in \\"very sinister clothes\\" to shake everyone up and become appreciated again, and to prevent a repeat of last time he informs the Colonel at GHQ of the plan, called \\"Operation Wake-Up\\". Taking pity on him, Mainwaring invites Hodges to join them which he gratefully accepts. He and his men (except Godfrey, who stays at the church hall to act as their contact man) meet up at their \\"secret base\\", although things get out of hand with disguises: Pike is dressed as an American Gangster, Frazer is in his undertaker attire, and Jones (going completely too far) comes as a nun. The Platoon and Hodges begin roaming the countryside, acting menacingly. Their efforts to frighten the locals are unsuccessful at first despite their attempts to put on foreign accents, mostly because people recognise them from their civilian jobs (Bank Employees, Butcher etc). However, when at last they finally do manage to cause some concern with their talk of \\"blowing up an aerodrome\\", the frightened locals send out for the Home Guard. With Mainwaring's platoon being obviously absent from their post, the neighbouring Eastgate platoon under Captain Square are called out, using Jones's van ‚Äî which is still at the church hall ‚Äî as transport. Tracking Mainwaring down to the disused flourmill they are using as their base, he and his men open fire, covering them in flour. The episode ends with Mainwaring and Square exchanging insults.

In the war there were numerous reports that German parachutists were disguising themselves as nuns, something referenced several times in the series. #At the \\"Six Bells\\" country pub, one character describes Dover as being about 20 miles away. Later this pub is described as five miles from Walmington, on the Dymchurch road.

Old timers referred to them as Konda Kar√°va another clan of the Karava similar to the Suriya clans Kurukulasuriya, Warnakulasuriya, Mihindukulasuriya, Bharathakulasuriya, Manukulasuriya, Arasakulasuriya and K√≥n Kar√°vas. Konda came to mean hair in Sri Lanka only after the 15th century Kotte period. Prior to that hair was referred to in the Sinhala language as kes, varalasa, dhammilla or muhulasa. The name Konda has been preserved to date in Sri Lankan Karava family names such as Vira Konda √Årachchige, Vadana Konda √Årachchige, Vira Konda Patabendige and other such names. The Kurukula Charithaya (part I 235) reproduces a copper sannasa given by King Vijayabahu, probably Vijayabahu VI, to a Konda Perumal at a time when Perumal denoted a prince. It also lists the Konda Kaurava family names: Konda Perumal √Årachchig√© from Koggala and Kuru Vira Kaundan, Periya Kondan, Sina Kondan, Sella Kondan, Vira Kondan, Kuru VIra Kondan, Kondag√©, Vira Kondag√©, Maha Kondag√©, Punchi Kondag√© and Sella Kondag√© from other parts of Sri Lanka. The prevalence of the name Konda in various parts of South India suggests that a significant group of Kondas of considerable importance lived in mediaeval South India. Similar to the other South Indian Kshatriya clans the Kondas too may have claimed descent ultimately from the Mahabharata Kauravas. The name Konda had been widely used in the Pandya kingdom and the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa refers to Punkonda, Khuddakancha Kunda and Kanga Konda in connection with the 12th century Pandyan invasion by the General of Par√°kramab√°hu the Great (Mahavamsa 76.94, 76.140, 76.171 & 76.184 ). Parantaka I, the Chola King who defeated the joint Sri Lankan and Pandyan armies had assumed the victory title Dorai Eelam Kondai on that account and therefore it appears that Kondai meant conqueror. Andhra Region Chola Adithya‚Äôs victory over Kondai Mandalam shifted the balance of power between the Pallavas and Cholas and was the beginning of the Chola empire. The Pallavas and Cholas were Kshatriyas connected by intermarriage and both dynasties claimed connections to the Mahabharata kings. Konda has also been used in place names such as Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh and an inscription of the Sri Lankan King Sahasamalla states that he had spent two years in a place called Gangaikondapattana in India (EZ II 225). And, two South Indian inscriptions by a Pandyan ruler named K√≥nerimel Kond√°n say that he had a camp at Gangakondapattana (Annual report on South Indian Epigraphy 125 ). The name Gangai in the above two inscriptions from the Ramnad district of India; Chodaganga of the Mahavansa account of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pandya invasion referred to above; the word Ganga in the names of Sri Lankan Rulers Chodaganga and Gangavasa Kalyanavati etc. point to the highly interconnected nature of mediaeval royal families in India and Sri Lanka. The Kudumirissa inscription of Sri Lanka refers to a clan known as Kaundinya gothra and the Galgan√© copper sannasa refers to Par√°kramab√°hu s√°mi‚Äôs ancestry as ‚Äú Sakala dig vijayavaliya ransa Konda Par√°kramab√°hu piriven s√°mi\\". Ulakkonda is a village in Gangapalatha, Udunuvara and Muthukeliy√°va a hilly site in Ulakkonda, far removed from the pearl producing coast, brings to mind the mutukuda (pearl umbrellas) and other insignia of the Karavas. Maluvawatta lies to the east of Ulakkonda and nearby is an ancient Bo tree with a legend that it was planted by a Brahmin in ancient times. As such Ulakkonda may well have been an abode of Konda nobles in the past (Sahithya 72). Two Kaur√°las in a village named Kondagama in Tumpan√©, have signed a deed in AD 1761 as witnesses (Gazetteer I 468), further documenting the Konda and Kar√°va linkage of the past. The Pattini cult in Sri Lankan history is associated with the Karavas brought back on king Gajabahu I‚Äôs Indian invasion, and as expected an old Pattini Devale is still there in the village known as Kondadeniya (Gazetteer II 528). The Rajavaliya narrates that a King named Edirimanasuriya ruled from a city in Sri Lanka known as Mundakondapola (Rajavaliya 234). Mundakondapola is situated 8 miles from Kurunegala on the Puttlam road, in the Hatara Korale, the old ‚ÄòKuru country‚Äô (parana Kuru Rata) of the Karavas. An old Sinhala verse which sings the praise of a king from Murakondaya who was deified as Irual Band√°ra says that he was from the Suryawansa, the Kshatriya Solar dynasty (Ceylon the Portuguese Era I 142). A contemporary of this Edirimanasuriya was the Karava King of Jaffna, Ethirimanasingham (AD 1592 - 1615). Ethirimanasingham was a king of the Singhe Dynasty of Jaffna, from which the Karava families of Tisseveerasinghe, Puvirajasinghe, Puvimanasinghe and Philip descend (Singhe Dynasty of Jaffnapattanam 19). The Karava Patangatim Domingo Corea also known as Edirimanasuriya was appointed by king Dharmapala in the 16th century to rule this region. Therefore, King Edirimanasuriya of Mundakondapola too appears to have been a regional Karava King, a Konda Kar√°va, possibly from the Kshatriya Keerawella family of the Hatara Korale. As such it appears that Konda in mediaeval India and Sri Lanka was a branch of the interrelated South Indian Kshatriya families which were spread in the Chola, Pandya and Pallava kingdoms and Sri Lanka. Over the centuries the Kondas have virtually been forgotten and traces of the Kondas remain only in a few place names and in Kar√°va family names.

Layouts can roughly be divided into three categories: front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive. Many different combinations of engine location and driven wheels are found in practice, and the location of each is dependent on the application for which the vehicle will be used. Front-wheel-drive layouts  FF layout = Front engine, front-wheel drive = The front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout (abbreviated as FF layout) places both the internal combustion engine and driven wheels at the front of the vehicle. This is the most common layout for cars since the late 20th century. = Mid-engine, front-wheel drive = Some early front-wheel drive cars from the 1930s had the engine located in the middle of the car. = Rear-engine, front-wheel-drive = A rear-engine, front-wheel-drive layout is one in which the engine is between or behind the rear wheels, and drives the front wheels via a driveshaft, the complete reverse of a conventional front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicle layout. This layout has only been used on prototype and concept cars.  Rear-wheel drive layouts  FR layout MR layout = Front-engine, rear-wheel drive = The front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout (abbreviated as FR layout) is one where the engine is located at the front of the vehicle and driven wheels are located at the rear. This was the traditional automobile layout for most of the 20th century, and remains the most common layout for rear-wheel drive vehicles. = Mid-engine, rear-wheel drive = The mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout (abbreviated as MR layout) is one where the rear wheels are driven by an engine placed just in front of them, behind the passenger compartment. In contrast to the rear-engined RR layout, the center of mass of the engine is in front of the rear axle. This layout is typically chosen for its low moment of inertia and relatively favorable weight distribution. = Rear-engine, rear-wheel drive = The rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout (abbreviated as RR layout) places both the engine and drive wheels at the rear of the vehicle. In contrast to the MR layout, the center of mass of the engine is between the rear axle and the rear bumper. Although very common in transit buses and coaches due to the elimination of the drive shaft with low-floor bus, this layout has become increasingly rare in passenger cars. The Porsche 911 is notable for its continuous use of the RR layout since 1963. Four- wheel drive layouts  F4 layout Drivetrains where power can be sent to all four wheels are referred to as either four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive (AWD). = Front-engine, four-wheel drive = The front-engine, four- wheel drive layout (abbreviated as F4 layout) places the engine at the front of the vehicle and drives all four roadwheels. This layout is typically chosen for better control on many surfaces, and is an important part of rally racing as well as off-road driving. Most four-wheel-drive layouts are front-engined and are derivatives of earlier front-engine, rear-wheel-drive designs. = Mid-engine, four-wheel drive = The mid-engine, four-wheel drive layout (abbreviated as M4 layout) places the engine in the middle of the vehicle, between both axles and drives all four road wheels. Although the term \\"mid- engine\\" can mean the engine is placed anywhere in the vehicle such that the centre of gravity of the engine lies between the front and rear axles, it is usually used for sports cars and racing cars where the engine is behind the passenger compartment. The motive output is then sent down a shaft to a differential in the centre of the car, which in the case of an M4 layout, distributes power to both front and rear axles. = Rear-engine, four-wheel drive = The rear-engine, four-wheel drive layout (abbreviated as R4) places the engine at the rear of the vehicle, and drives all four wheels. This layout is typically chosen to improve the traction or the handling of existing vehicle designs using the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RR). For example, the Porsche 911 added all-wheel drive to the existing line-up of rear-wheel drive models in 1989.

He is remembered for his polemic work Pugio Fidei (c. 1270). In 1250 he was one of eight friars appointed to make a study of oriental languages with the purpose of carrying on a mission to Jews and Moors. He worked in Spain as a missionary, and also for a short time in Tunis. A document bearing his signature and dated July 1284 shows that he was at that time still living. Biography He was born in the first half of the 13th century at Subirats in Catalonia; and died after 1284. It is speculated that he could have been of Jewish origin. In 1250 he was selected by the provincial chapter, sitting in Toledo, to study Oriental languages at a Dominican school which had been founded for the express purpose of preparing its pupils to engage in polemics against Jews and Moors. Subsequently he lived for a long time in a monastery at Barcelona. Censorship of the Talmud In March 1264, he was commissioned, with the Bishop of Barcelona, Raymond of Penyafort, and two other Dominicans, Arnau de Segarra and Pere Gener, to examine the Hebrew manuscripts and books which the Jews, by order of the king, were to submit to them, and to cancel passages deemed offensive to the Christian religion. This is the first instance of Dominican censorship of the Talmud in Spain. Their report was not severe, however, since Mart√≠ declared that many passages were confirmatory of the truth of Christianity, and that the Talmud should not be burned entirely (Pugio Fidei, ii.14, ¬ß8). Polemic literature Mart√≠ was the author of two anti-Jewish books, one of which, the Capistrum Judaeorum, first published in 1990. His refutation of the Koran is lost. There is at Bologna a manuscript of his Capistrum Judaeorum, aimed at the errors of the Jews; and at Tortosa a manuscript containing Explanatio simboli apostolorum ad institutionem fidelium which has a marginal note that it was edited \\"a fratre Ro Martini de ordine predicatorum\\". Mart√≠'s work was for a long time the chief source for Dominican polemics. The Pugio Fidei His chief work, the Pugio Fidei, was lost for a long time, but was finally brought to light by Justus Scaliger, and edited by Joseph de Voisin of the Sorbonne (d. 1685), with many notes, under the title Pugio Fidei Raymundi Martini Ordinis Pr√¶dicatorum Adversus Mauros et Jud√¶os (Paris, 1651). The work treats of God's omniscience, the Creation, immortality, and the resurrection of the dead, and attempts to show the falsity of the Jewish religion; the latter part of the work is valuable on account of its extracts from the Talmud, the Midrash, and other sources. This work was used by Porchetus de Salvaticis at the beginning of the 14th century in his Victoria Porcheti adversus impios Hebreos (printed 1520), by Hieronymus de Sancta Fide in his Hebraeomastix and elsewhere, and was plagiarized by Petrus Galatinus. About 1620 Fran√ßois Bosquet discovered in the Collegium Fuxense (the Coll√®ge de Foix in Toulouse) a manuscript of the Pugio, and it was from this and three other manuscripts that de Voisin edited the work. Better known than this edition is its reprint by J. B. Carpzov (Leipzig and Frankfurt, 1687), with the anti-Jewish preface Introduction in Theologiam Judaicam. Knowledge of Hebrew literature Mart√≠ has been accused of forgery because of his quotations from Genesis Rabbah, which were not otherwise known; but Leopold Zunz defends him against this charge (Gottesdienstliche Vortr√§ge der Juden p. 300). Mart√≠ was widely read in Hebrew literature, quoting not only from Talmudic and Midrashic works, but from Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, Maimonides, and ·∏≤im·∏•i. His fundamental views, which he attempts to substantiate by his citations, are that Jesus is announced in rabbinical literature as the Messiah and Son of God; that the Jewish laws, although revealed by God, are abrogated by the advent of the Messiah. Another prominent aspect of his contribution was the enumeration and rejection of the \\"tikkune soferim\\", alleged corrections made by Jewish scribes on the Biblical text. Mart√≠ directly and publicly charged these emendations upon the Hebrew scribes as \\"willful corruptions and perversions introduced by them into the sacred text.\\"Oliver Turnbull Crane, \\"Tikkun Sopherim\\", Hebraica, The University of Chicago Press, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Jul., 1887), pp. 233, 234.

Definition  Supernumeraries rehearse a scene of Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlo The term's original use, from the Latin supernumerarius, meant someone paid to appear on stage in crowd scenes or in the case of opera as non-singing small parts. The word can still be found used for such in theatre and opera. It is the equivalent of \\"extra\\" in the motion picture industry. Any established opera company will have a supernumerary core of artists to enhance the opera experience. The Metropolitan Opera (Met) in New York and the Washington National Opera are known for their high profile and seasoned supernumeraries. The WNO saw its supernumerary golden age under the direction of English actress Jennifer Crier Johnston, who was supernumerary director for eight years (1998‚Äì2006). Ms. Johnston appeared in classic Hollywood movies such as My Fair Lady, The Unsinkable Mollie Brown, The Americanization of Emily, and The Sound of Music. The Washington Times ran an exhaustive article on supernumeraries in November 2002, in which a Jennifer Johnston describes in detail the fine craft of a supernumerary in the opera. The WNO has had some major supernumerary personalities on stage such as U.S. Supreme Court Justices Ginsburg and Kennedy who made their last appearance in the opening of Strauss comedic opera Die Fledermaus. New, promising, and exciting supernumeraries at the Washington National Opera include: Marlene Hall, David Brindley, Michael Walker, Emily Cohen, Eric Schultz, Felipe Lagos, Victor Yager, John Tinpe, Rey Rivera, Samantha Smith, Liam McKenna, and Toni Smiley. Other long time famed supernumeraries include Fernando Varisco, Karl Moeller, Patrizia DiZebba, Harry Spence, Peter Whitten, Alex Riley, Gary Nooger, and Alain Letort. In 2005 Walker, Yager and Varisco were invited by the well known opera director Cindy Oxberry, who has been assistant director for the WNO for over 10 years, to work in a brand new production of The Washington Savoyards' The Mikado. Oxberry's style and force were obvious in these performances and the Washington Post agreed that \\"The Savoyards fully captured the energy of Arthur Sullivan's inimitable melodiousness and the thrust of William Schwenck Gilbert's satiric dialogue, riddled -- perhaps a little too obviously -- with updated political jabs.\\"The Savoyards' 'Mikado.' Washington Post, November 2005. Typical supernumerary work  Supernumeraries are usually amateur character artists who train under professional direction to create a believable scene. They almost become part of the props and give a sense of credibility to scenes where crowds, court assistants, lackeys, peasants or a variety of period characters are needed. Ms. Johnston's style emerged through her experiences in Hollywood and the British theater and she coached all of her supernumeraries until the character, the movements, pose and demeanor matched the period of the opera being presented. Rehearsals can last from two weeks to several months depending on the complexity of the performances. Some operas require over 50 supernumeraries. Work is assigned according to the ability to look the part and in many cases by the costume size since many of the productions are borrowed from other major opera houses. The Varisco- Johnston style of \\"supering\\" emphasizes an understated performance that doesn't \\"steal focus from the main actors\\" but it is still vibrant and effusive. Other styles have evolved like the method acting of Yager and Walker. The repertory at any established opera house certainly includes operas with many supernumeraries. Setting a record, with 227 supers, was a new production of Prokofiev's War and Peace, which had its last performance of the season on March 19, 2006. Other operas at the Met and other great opera houses awash in supers include Aida (the triumphal march with 165) and Puccini's La Boh√®me (the Caf√© Momus scene with 125), according to Fran√ßois Giuliani, press director of the Met. (Those numbers do not include soloists, members of the chorus and dancers.) But the chance of being a super is pretty much limited to those with experience and \\"people who can take direction,\\" said Bob Diamond, administrator of supernumeraries at the Met. \\"We don't take people off the street,\\" he added. It is commonly accepted that an opera will use ten men as extras for every woman. \\"That's opera, and we have no control,\\" Mr. Diamond said. The commitment in terms of time can range from as little as one two-hour rehearsal and a dress rehearsal‚Äîbut supers do have to agree to take part in a minimum number of performances‚Äîto as much as five hours a day for four or five weeks for, say, a newly staged opera.Paul Freireich. 'Being a Super at the Met.' The New York Times, February 26, 2007 Supernumerary work keeps evolving as operas evolve. There has been a merger of techniques used in Broadway, movies and opera. A good illustration of this type of merging is seen for the second time at the WNO 2006 Fall opera season with the presentation of Puccini's Madama Butterfly, wherein Polish director Mariusz Treli≈Ñski, originally a movie director, presented his innovative production which used an extensive cast of supernumeraries as Japanese fishermen, Yamadories and live statues. The Washington Blade took notice of these statues and described them effectively: \\"A wall of Japanese statues come to life and drop flower petals from the heights of the opera stage at Pinkerton‚Äôs impending return...\\"Greg Marzullo. 'Operatic greatness.' The Washington Blade. November 10, 2006 Having said this, directors sometimes take too many artistic liberties with some operas and the final result is not what is to be expected. This can be illustrated with Marta Domingo's production of La Traviata presented at the Washington National Opera in May 2004. Supernumerary Varisco played the part of death during the last act, and this is what the Washington Post said about this supernumerary character: > Stage director Marta (\\"Mrs.\\") Domingo seems to have taken the Hippocratic > oath as her inspiration for this \\"Traviata\\": She does no harm. Her > conception is pretty generic, though‚Äîballrooms and sickbeds, bright lights > and heavy curtains‚Äîand the few directorial \\"touches\\" I could discern (the > shadow of death marching by with a scythe outside Violetta's window) were > not especially effective. Imagine a production, any production, of \\"La > Traviata\\" and you'll probably have a pretty good idea of this one.Tim Page. > 'Traviata' 1.0 WNO Stages Verdi's Original Version. Washington Post. May 10, > 2004 Supernumeraries can add a very dramatic effect when they are properly used in grand opera productions such as Aida and Le Cid. The logistics of managing such a corps require a supernumerary coordinator with experience and talent. In the case of Le Cid, supernumeraries had to be trained for six weeks by a professional stunt expert in the art of medieval fighting brought from Spain specifically for this purpose. Opera critics can note the effect of a sizeable supernumerary corps: > The stage layout is sensible but compelling--a set of ascending stairs > running deep upstage, sometimes topped by a very impressive squadron of > cavalry in full armor. Crosses, gates and moving side panels delineate > different scenes. De Ana uses his very large chorus, supplemented by > athletic supernumeraries, with precision: They move quickly, creating > striking tableaux that bristle with bellicose energy.Philip Kennicott.

Career =Brazil= Alex Terra began his professional career at Fluminense where he won numerous trophies in the Brazilian top flight. His performances with Fluminense won him a loan transfer to Portugal's C.D. Nacional, and later to Ponte Preta in the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B, where he scored 19 times in 24 games. His fine form in the S√©rie B saw him return to the top flight with a transfer to Goi√°s. In 2008 due to a serious injury on his left knee he was not able to play the entire season while he was at Goi√°s, and in February 2009, Alex managed to secure a deal with Portuguesa, but he did not pass the medical tests and did not sign with them. In March, he signed a one-year deal with Bahia, where he did not live up to the club's expectations of him, and was released by the club in June. Alex signed a short-term deal with Rio Branco in February 2010, in order to play the remainder of the Campeonato Paulista season. He played in eight games and scored one goal against Palmeiras. Rio Branco were eventually relegated to the second division of the Campeonato Paulista. =Australia= At the completion of his stint with Rio Branco, on 10 May 2010 it was announced that he would be joining new A-League franchise Melbourne Heart, for their inaugural 2010‚Äì11 season. He made his competitive debut for the Heart in the club's first A-League match, in which it was defeated one‚Äìnil by the Central Coast Mariners. He made himself a fan favourite through his pace and flair, in addition to scoring important and spectacular goals, including the winning goal against crosstown rivals Melbourne Victory in the first-ever Melbourne derby, and a stunning bicycle- kick goal against Perth Glory. The latter was cited by many publications as the goal of the season, and was recognised by Fox Sports as one of the best goals in A-League history. He managed to play in 20 matches and score four goals for the season, despite persistent injuries hampering him throughout.

Early career He started his career at the age of 9 appearing on a children's television talent show called Swallow's Juniors and appeared as a regular on that show for the next five years. At the age of 10 he made his first recording on a 78rpm acetate, \\"Lucky Devil\\"/\\"If Irish Eyes Were Shining\\". He was performing in Sunday afternoon pop shows at Melbourne's Festival Hall at the age of 14 and at 16 he was signed to a record contract with Ivan Dayman's Sunshine label (whose roster included top singers such as Normie Rowe and Tony Worsley). This led to regular appearances on Melbourne's teen TV show, \\"The GO Show\\". Australian pop star From 1965 to 1967, he released ten 45 records in Australia, of which seven made the Top 40, the most successful of which were a cover of Conway Twitty's Speechless (The Pick Up), and a rousing version of Solomon Burke's Stupidity. He was backed by Melbourne band The Phantoms on all these recordings. He then recorded two singles with the band Grandmas Tonic as lead vocalist. His last two singles, once again under his own name, were for the Astor label although he was still backed on them by Grandma's Tonic,(ex-members of Tony Worsley's backing band 'The Fabulous Blue Jays'). May 1968 saw him join the vocal trio 'The Virgil Brothers', Australia's answer to The Walker Brothers. The Virgil Brothers released two singles in Australia in 1968, \\"Temptation 'Bout to Get Me\\" (a Top 5 hit) and \\"Here I Am\\". They then relocated to the UK where they recorded their third single, When You Walk Away with producer David McKay. He then quit the trio which broke up soon after.The Virgil Brothers, MILESAGO: Australasian Music & Popular Culture 1964-1975. With The New Seekers In 1970, not long after the Virgil Bros had dissolved, he joined the second line- up of The New Seekers. Recommended by Melbourne radio DJ Stan Rofe. This line- up was their most successful and enduring and during his time with them they had a string of international hits, such as Melanie Safka's \\"What Have They Done to My Song Ma\\", Delaney & Bonnie's \\"Never Ending Song of Love\\" and \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\". In 1972, The New Seekers came second representing the UK, in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Beg, Steal or Borrow\\", on which he duetted with his then girlfriend Lyn Paul. As well as sharing vocals in The New Seekers he was a talented songwriter and contributed many songs to their albums which included ballads such as \\"I Can Say You're Beautiful\\" and \\"Lay Me Down\\" and more uptempo numbers like \\"Boom Town\\" and \\"Cincinnati\\". Later career and life He quit The New Seekers, apparently disillusioned with lack of monetary rewards, in 1973 and resumed his solo career, as a singer-songwriter. He continued working in the UK until 1981, during which period he issued five solo singles, including a cover of The Easybeats \\"Friday on My Mind\\", and one album, Skin Deep. During this time in the UK he also recorded advertising jingles for Ribena and Sugar Puffs, provided the vocal for a children's single, \\"Jungle Ted and the Laceybuttonpoppers\\" and did backing vocals on Lyn Paul's UK Top 40 solo single, \\"It Oughta Sell A Million\\". In 1975 Glen Wheatley asked Peter to join the Little River Band as lead vocalist, but at this stage Peter wanted to make his way as a solo performer and declined the offer. By 1976, with the backing of David Mackay, Peter had secured a recording with RCA and his first single, released on 13 August 1976, was a version of the Easybeats' Friday on My Mind. This failed to chart, as did his follow up single, Skin Deep. His album, also entitled Skin Deep, released in 1977, included a variety of musical styles and six songs penned by Peter, but this too failed to provide him with solo success. It was around this time that Peter met the love of his life, Jane Garner, who later became his wife. Two singles were issued on the independent Limelight label in 1980: the first of these was a cover of Peter McCann's US hit \\"Do You Wanna Make Love\\". This song, ironically, had also been covered two years earlier by The New Seekers with Peter Doyle's replacement, Danny Finn, on lead vocal. Peter returned to Australia in 1981 to work with a band called Standing Room Only. In 1982, ex-Wings drummer, Steve Holly, invited him to join the group Regis in the US, where he worked for the next five years. Returning to Australia in 1987, Doyle regularly performed on the club circuit. From 1991 to 1993, he was a member of the Ram Band in Melbourne, providing vocals, played bass and keyboards. He appeared with The Ram Band on the \\"Living Legends Live Benefit Concert\\" Filmed and Recorded at The Palace Entertainment Complex St Kilda in May 1992. Four original songs written by John van Boxtel and recorded by Doyle on his 4-track tape deck at his home in 1991 are the last known original new song demos he performed. His musical career was curtailed when he suffered ill-health later in the 1990s. Death He died in Castlemaine, Victoria, of throat cancer, on 13 October 2001.

A middle to lower order right-handed batsman and a medium- fast right-arm bowler, Tony Brown was a successful county cricketer with Gloucestershire County Cricket Club for 20 years and was county captain between 1969 and 1976. Initially used primarily as an opening bowler for a county that had traditionally relied heavily on spin bowling, Brown took more than 100 wickets in both the 1959 and 1962 seasons and formed an effective new-ball partnership with the England Test player David Smith, used before the Test spin trio of David Allen, John Mortimore and Sam Cook were brought into action. Later in his career, his batting developed significantly, and he passed 1,000 runs in the 1964 season. He was also an excellent close fielder, and in 1966, playing for Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, he held seven catches in an innings, equalling the world record for a fielder set in 1957 by Micky Stewart. In his first-class cricket career, he scored more than 12,000 runs and took more than 1,200 wickets, holding 493 catches. As an administrator, he succeeded Grahame Parker as Secretary of Gloucestershire on his retirement from first-class cricket in 1976. In 1981 he became Secretary of Somerset. In 1984 he was appointed Manager of the England Team that toured India and Australia in 1984/85 when the Test Series v India was won 2‚Äì1, by the team captained by David Gower and the ODI Series by 4‚Äì1; India were World ODI Cup Champions at that time. He was also Manager of the England Tour which toured West Indies in 1986. In 1988 he succeeded Brian Langley as Administration Secretary of the then TCCB (Test and County Cricket Board), now ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) until his retirement in 1997. He was Chairman of Cricket at Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 1999 until 2007 and President of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 2008 to 2011, when he was succeeded by his former team-mate, David Allen.

Governor of Khurasan When Muhammad's father Tahir ibn Abdallah died in 862, the caliph wanted to replace him with Tahir's brother Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, but after the latter refused he appointed Muhammad as governor. The caliph however did not grant Muhammad other titles usually reserved for the Tahirid governor of Khurasan, such as the military governorship of Iraq and Baghdad (sahib al- shurta), but instead gave them to Muhammad ibn Abdallah.; ; ; . When he became governor, Muhammad was still young and rather inexperienced. Only two years after he succeeded his father, Tabaristan was lost to a Zaydi revolt under Hasan ibn Zayd ibn Muhammad, and the Tahirids were unable to recover the province. In 867 the Saffarid amir of Sistan, Ya'qub al-Saffar, took Herat and imprisoned its Tahirid governor. An army was dispatched under the Samanid Ibrahim ibn Ilyas to stop Ya'qub, but was defeated, after which Muhammad was forced to come to terms. During this time Muhammad also tried to gain the offices in the West that had been given to his uncle Muhammad. After the latter died in 867 his brother 'Ubaydallah had taken over the offices. In opposition to Ubaydallah, Muhammad sent another uncle, Sulayman ibn 'Abdallah, as his representative in Iraq, and Sulayman was able to gain the posts at the expense of Ubaydallah, although the latter would eventually recover them.; ; ; . The weakness of Muhammad's rule in Khurasan would eventually lead to the end of Tahirid rule there. In 873 the Saffarid Ya'qub marched on Muhammad's capital, Nishapur. Muhammad refused to flee and was captured by the Saffarids. For three years he remained in captivity, but was freed by caliphal forces after the Saffarids were defeated at the Battle of Dair al-'Aqul in 876. After he was freed the caliph reinvested him with the governorship of Khurasan, although Muhammad never asserted his authority there. Several anti-Saffarid partisans in Khurasan, such as Ahmad al-Khujistani and Rafi' ibn Harthama, placed Muhammad's name in the khutba in areas they managed to control, but Muhammad never exercised any actual authority over them.; ; ; ; . Later life After being freed by the caliph, Muhammad took up residence in Baghdad and from there attempted to gain the offices held by Ubaydallah ibn Abdallah. This conflict between the two Tahirids would continue for several years. In 879 the Saffarid Ya'qub died and was succeeded by his brother Amr bin Laith. Amr reached an agreement with the caliph and was invested with Khurasan, replacing Muhammad. As the governor of Khurasan, Amr now asserted the rights formally held by the Tahirids to nominate his representative for the offices in the West; his choice fell on 'Ubadydallah. Amr also used his influence to have Muhammad arrested for allegedly supporting Khujistani, although there was little evidence to support this.; ; . Muhammad regained caliphal favor when the peace between the caliphate and the Saffarids fell out in around 884. He was made governor of Baghdad in place of 'Ubaydallah and regained the title of governor of Khurasan, though as before he was never able to reestablish his rule in that province.; ; Muhammad's tenure as governor/sahib al-shurtah of Baghdad is somewhat ambiguous. Al-Tabari, v. 37: p. 148, reports that in 885 al-Husayn ibn Isma'il was the sahib al-shurtah as Muhammad's deputy. In 886 Muhammad brought an end to a riot against Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Ta'i, who had been blamed for a food shortage in the city; v. 37: p. 151. In 889 Ahmad was imprisoned; al-Tabari mentions here that he been in charge of the shurtah prior to his arrest; v. 37: p. 157. He died sometime around 910.; .

This is the Wainwright summit of the fell. Rosthwaite Fell is a fell in the English Lake District. It is situated some due south of Keswick and south of the village of Rosthwaite in Borrowdale. Rosthwaite Fell also has loose connections to the Scafell group of fells. The fells name derives from the Old Norse language and means ‚ÄúThe peak above the clearing with a heap of stones‚Äù with ‚Äúhreysi‚Äù meaning a heap of stones and ‚Äúthveit‚Äù meaning a clearing. Topography Rosthwaite Fell reaches a height of 612 m (2,008 ft) at its highest point, which is commonly known as Rosthwaite Cam. It also has a subsidiary top, Bessyboot (550 m, 1,804 ft ), which lies 800 metres north of the main summit. Alfred Wainwright took Bessyboot as the summit of the fell for his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. Dovenest Crag, which lies 500 metres south west of the summit, is generally considered to be a part of Glaramara and is covered in that article. The fell's boundaries are clearly defined to the north, west and east by valleys and streams. The western side falls to Borrowdale and the infant River Derwent, the eastern flank descends to the Langstrath valley and its beck while the northern slopes go down to the Stonethwaite valley. To the south, Rosthwaite Fell is linked to the higher and better known fell of Glaramara by a marshy and undulating ridge which goes over several subsidiary tops on the way. Rosthwaite Fell is craggy and steep on the three sides that descend to valleys and there is no simple and appealing route of ascent. This, combined with the fact that there are many more attractive climbs in the area, makes the fell a quiet and unfrequented place. Geology Because of its unique geology, Rosthwaite Fell was declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1985 over an area of 230 hectares. With the English Nature web site saying: \\"The extensive crags and rock outcrops within this site provide outstanding exposures of a thick succession of volcanic rock-layers representing a large proportion of the important episode of volcanic activity which generated the Borrowdale Volcanic Group during the middle Ordovician Period of geological history, about 460 million years ago. A wide variety of different rocktypes are present and well exposed within the site. This is an important site as a reference section for detailed geological study and is of historical interest as an area where certain volcanic rock-types were first recognised.\\" Ascents Rosthwaite Fell can be climbed from Stonethwaite or from the Borrowdale road between Seatoller and Rosthwaite. The latter route goes up Combe Gill for a kilometre before striking steeply up the gill's eastern flank to gain the top of the fell. The Stonethwaite route uses Stanger Gill as a guide up to a height of almost 500 metres from where it is a simple walk to the summit of Bessyboot. A mild scramble also allows the north ridge to be ascended starting behind Chapel Farm and keeping west of the locally named Papelay Crag. Summits The fell's two main summits, Rosthwaite Cam and Bessyboot, are divided by a depression with a height of around 500 metres which contains the charmingly named Tarn at Leaves, a small mountain lake with a length of approximately 100 metres. The summit rocks of Rosthwaite Cam require some mild scrambling to reach the highest point.

Plot The National Health Service is having problems, and the Goodies are disgusted with the poor services. In a frustrated response to their criticisms, the National Health Service suggests to them that they study medicine and become doctors themselves in order to improve things. As a result, the Goodies become doctors. They pass all the tests -- including beer drinking and nurse chasing. Later, Graeme develops a special tonic and the Goodies sell it at a medicine show. They also set up their own eccentric outdoor hospital, performing X-rays (one scene shows Graeme being frightened and running away at the sight of a skeleton emerging from behind the X-ray machine) and operations, as well as setting bones and delivering babies. The Goodies become obsessed with curing people, and collect patients from all over, including a patient from the back of an ambulance. Soon, all of Britain is cured by Graeme's tonic. Even a mummy, in a museum, is brought back to life by Graeme's tonic. When the Goodies later become ill, they discover that curing the nation from sickness has unexpected disadvantages.

Like many of the early karateka he first trained in judo before starting karate in 1969 at the Blackfriers club in London, where he trained under Keinosuke Enoeda, Hirokazu Kanazawa, KatoDave Hazard Born Fighter John Blake Publishing 2007 p35 and Takahashi.< In 1977 Hazard went to Japan where he studied in Japan Karate Association (JKA) instructor classes under Masatoshi Nakayama. In 1982 Mick Dewey formed the South of England Karate Union (SEKU). Dewey had been good friends with Hazard for many years and in 1985 invited Hazard to join himself and Mervyn O'Donnell in The South of England Karate Union. At this time Hazard lived in Leyton, East London, and Dewey arranged for him to join the Brighton Karate Club (Dewey had formed the club with Phil Elliott in 1974). Hazard accepted the invitation and moved from London to Brighton where he ran the club for nineteen years, serving as Technical Director and Grading Examiner to SEKU until he left and moved to Nottingham. Later The 'South of England Karate Union' was renamed The Shotokan of England Karate Union. The Brighton Karate Club is now run by Jess Lavender a 7th Dan. Hazard later left SEKU and is now the chief instructor of an international association in the form of the Academy of Shotokan Karate, which he founded in 2003,< feeling in need of an environment that would allow him personally to evolve his approach to Shotokan Karate-Do. He is assisted within the ASK by senior instructors and karate-ka like Jeff Westgarth, Jess Lavender, Paul Herbert and Juli Pops. He is also the former kata coach for the English national squad, due to the restructuring of the EKGB. He brings to many training courses his expertise in kata and their applications to differing situations. Early years David Frederick Hazard was born in Bow, London, England, in 1952. His father's family owned a road haulage company and a public house, while his mother's family worked in the docks. At first the family lived in the upper two rooms of a four-room terraced house in Stepney, with a shared outside toilet. When Dave was seven the family moved Harlow new town in Essex, to a house with two inside toilets, space for everyone and a garden. A few years later when Dave was about thirteen however his parents separated and his mother took the children back to the east end of London to a flat in Leyton. While his mother worked hard to support them he went to Ruckholt Manor Secondary School, an old and tough place. Refusing to join a gang he was picked on by both sides. After a bad beating by a group of boys one day his mother took him round to their houses so that he could fight and beat them one at a time, after which he had little more trouble.Dave Hazard Born Fighter John Blake Publishing 2007 p15 Not being a model student he had a regular Friday afternoon appointment with the headmaster for a caning. On one occasion the drama teacher challenged Dave to a fight for disrupting his classes and gave him a beating. The following day he took Dave out to the pub for a beer and advised him to use his brains constructively. On another occasion a teacher who had beaten a boy about the head causing temporary blindness was thrown out of a second floor window by older boys, breaking his legs and hips.Dave Hazard, Born Fighter, John Blake Publishing 2007, p.22 Working Hazard left school aged sixteen and became an apprentice hairdresser in an old fashioned barbers shop where he became skilled at cutting hair. While working in another barbers shop a customer told him about Blackfriars karate club where there were Japanese instructors. In August 1969 he went to watch his first session, with Keinosuke Enoeda teaching assisted by Kato, and decided he wanted to become as good as a yellow belt he watched there.Dave Hazard Born Fighter John Blake Publishing 2007 p36 In 1972 Dave passed his first Dan grading. At the following training session he was still wearing a brown belt and Enoeda swapped belts with him, telling him to keep the black belt with Enoeda's name embroidered on it.Dave Hazard Born Fighter John Blake Publishing 2007 p65 Not long afterwards he was selected for the English national team.Dave Hazard Born Fighter John Blake Publishing 2007 p70 By the time Blackfriars dojo closed, the building being needed for a different use, Hazard had risen from beginner to run the club. As a professional instructor Hazard taught a girl called Katy at Goldsmiths College karate club who was known as \\"Ee-ee\\" because of her squeaky kiai. Kate Bush was later seen on television singing her high pitched hit song \\"Wuthering Heights\\" with dance moves that Hazard said appeared to come from karate.Dave Hazard Born Fighter John Blake Publishing 2007 p114 As well as also working as a doorman Hazard worked in a number of jobs including auto-electrics with his uncle and steel fixing, putting concrete reinforcing bars in place.Dave Hazard Born Fighter John Blake Publishing 2007 p110 Training in Japan In 1977 Hazard travelled to Japan to train with the top masters, where he was invited to train in the JKA Instructors Class. On leaving London he was surprised to find Tomita waiting at the airport to see him off. He had met Tomita when he had first come to England and now Tomita was repaying him. Training at the JKA headquarters in Ebisu, Tokyo he was recommended by Enoeda to study the technique of Mikio Yahara who was of similar build. The two of them got on well and trained hard against each other. Joining SEKU In April 1982 twenty clubs in the south of England, led by Mick Dewey of Portsmouth club decided to leave the KUGB and formed a new association, The South of England Karate Union. When clubs from northern England later joined this was changed to The Shotokan of England Karate Union. In 1985, with SEKU growing, Dewey asked his old friend Hazard to join the organisation as Technical Director. To be a SEKU grading examiner Hazard needed to have his own club, so he moved from London to Brighton where he took over the running of Brighton Karate Club, building it into an elite dojo training black and brown belts almost exclusively. At SEKU Hazard started an instructors' class on the lines of that he had trained in Japan, to improve quality and uniformity of teaching. Founding the Academy of Shotokan Karate In 2003, after nineteen years with SEKU (technical director since 1985), Hazard left to set up his own federation the Academy of Shotokan Karate (ASK). ASK is an international organisation founded to promote excellence in Shotokan karate as a martial art rather than as a sport.Shotokan Karate Magazine Issue 97 October 2008 Emphasis is placed on study of the kata and their applications in self-defence. This direction was approved by the late Keinosuke Enoeda, whose principles are continued by the federation. The founding clubs were mostly former members of SEKU and were joined by clubs from Ireland and Canada. The association's competitions are held biennially in Nottingham, England. The first competition was attended by Enoeda's widow, who was presented with a photograph of her husband from the 1960s which she had not seen before. At the 2006 Shobu Ippon international competition at Guildford Spectrum a five-man ASK kumite team, all from Kihaku Dojo, won the inter federation team fight, and the federation has placed high in the Shobu-ippon medal table in subsequent years. The Grading Examiner and Senior Instructor for the South of England is Jess Lavender who took over Hazard's Brighton Dojo, after Hazard relocated to Nottingham.

Many members of these bands played significant parts during the time of political change Wende in 1989. The bands came from a broad range of musical genres, especially Punk, Blues, Wave, Indie and Electronic music. Radio DJ Lutz Schramm introduced the other bands to a wider audience in his show Parocktikum on East Germany's youth radio station DT 64 (now Sputnik/MDR). In 1988 the East German record label AMIGA released a sampler called \\"Kleeblatt Nr. 23 - Die anderen Bands\\". A year later another sampler was released, named after the radio show their music was first aired in: \\"Parocktikum\\". Having been limited to self-produced records and (sometimes illegal) gigs, both the radio show and the samplers offered a great opportunity for alternative bands to promote their material. The old system prevented free performances, only bands with an \\"Einstufung\\" (rating) were able to have an official approved gig. From 1990 on several samplers with alternative bands from the former GDR were released. Most of the bands are now defunct, but some like Dekadance, Freygang and Herbst in Peking still exist.

Bernard represented Scotland twice, with both appearances coming in 1995. Career He was born in Edinburgh but moved to Manchester as a small child in the mid-1970s, and grew up as a Hearts supporter. Bernard started his career with Oldham Athletic, and is remembered for scoring the equaliser in the famous 3‚Äì2 win over Sheffield Wednesday in only his second game for the club during the 1990‚Äì91 season when the Latics sealed the Second Division title and returned to the First Division after a 68-year exile. He was soon a regular player in the Boundary Park midfield, helping them achieve survival in the First Division in 1991‚Äì92 and the new FA Premier League in 1992‚Äì93. He helped them reach the FA Cup semi-finals in the 1993‚Äì94 campaign, and when the Latics took the lead over Manchester United with an extra time goal by Neil Pointon, it looked as though Bernard and his teammates were on their way to the club's first ever FA Cup final. However, a late equaliser by United's Mark Hughes forced a replay, which the Latics lost 4‚Äì1 at Maine Road. They were relegated on the final day of the season after only managing a 1‚Äì1 draw with Norwich City. He played a total of 112 league games for the Latics, scoring 18 goals.

He was also arguably, for almost half a century, the best doubles rackets player in the world. At one time he owned and ran a nightclub, and as a result was charged with ‚Äúkeeping or managing a brothel‚Äù, but was acquitted. Life He was born close to Lord's and was educated at Eton. His father committed suicide; his mother was an international ice hockey player.\\"Tom Pugh, cricketer - obituary\\" Retrieved 19 February 2016. Whilst doing his National Service and serving on HMS Adamant, he suffered a breakdown and was taken to a mental hospital in Portsmouth. He bought and ran the nightclub King Sauna in Chelsea, formerly a closed down gay club, which was raided by the police and exposed by the News of the World. He was charged under the Sexual Offences Act, but was found not guilty. He subsequently ran a flower business, imported karaoke machines and ran karaoke evenings in both Florida and London. In the early 1960s he was short-listed to be the first actor to play James Bond, having come to the attention of the producers through having appeared in television cigarette advertisements, but Sean Connery was preferred. His first wife, the model Kitty Green, also had a James Bond connection, in 1965 having a small part in Thunderball. His second wife was Misty Ramsawak, from Trinidad and Tobago. He had two sons by his first wife and a daughter by his second. Cricket Tom Pugh was a right-handed batsman who played in 80 first-class matches between 1959 and 1962, including 76 for Gloucestershire whom he captained in 1961 and 1962. He shared a record second-wicket stand for Gloucestershire of 256 with Tom Graveney versus Derbyshire at Chesterfield in 1960, scoring 137. In the 1960 season as a whole, he scored 1,011 runs at an average of 21.51. At the end of the 1960 season, Pugh, whose batting according to The Daily Telegraph \\"hardly surpassed old Etonian standards\\" was controversially appointed captain of Gloucestershire. According to the Times, Graveney, whom he replaced, was not forewarned; the change was made because professionals were not regarded as suitable leaders. Graveney promptly resigned and joined Worcestershire. Pugh's first season as captain in 1961 was spoilt by injury: he broke his jaw and missed 18 games. He ducked into a full toss from David Larter and not only suffered a broken jaw but was also given out lbw for a duck. In April 1962, Pugh organised a tour to Bermuda during which the county played a soccer match against the island team with Stanley Matthews guesting for Gloucestershire. On the three-week tour the county team played ten cricket matches against local teams. Pugh played in every match in 1962, but his batting returns were modest, and he averaged only 15 in County Championship matches. He was sacked from the captaincy at the end of the 1962 season, despite the fact that Gloucestershire finished fourth in the table and won nine out of the last 15 matches. Gloucestershire won 14 matches under Pugh's captaincy in that season.\\"GLOUCESTERSHIRE CRICKET SADDENED BY THE DEATH OF FORMER CAPTAIN TOM PUGH\\" Retrieved 20 February 2016 They have never won as many matches in a season since. He was bitter about his sacking, and refused to attend reunions of former players. He was a nephew of the former Lancashire captain Peter Eckersley, and also of John Pugh who played for Warwickshire. He represented Middlesex Young Cricketers and was recommended to Gloucestershire by Percy Fender.Professional Cricketers Association: Obituaries Retrieved 19 February 2016. Rackets In rackets, Pugh won the Public Schools Doubles for Eton in 1955 with Lord Chelsea, and was runner up in the Amateur Singles in 1967 and 1970. He won the Noel Bruce Cup (Old Boys Doubles) for Eton six times between 1962 and 1986 with James Leonard (1962, 1963 and 1965), David Norman (1964) and Willie Boone (1984 and 1986). With Willie Boone he also won the Amateur Doubles in 1975, 1976 and 1977, having first won it with JR Thompson in 1966. He won the Combined Services Past and Present Singles in 1959, 1961 and 1965, and dominated the doubles for many years, winning with Lieutenant Commander Peter Kershaw (1958 and 1959), his brother Tim (1963, 1967 and 1972) and Geoffrey Atkins (1976, 1982, 1983 and 1984).

Graveney was a lower order left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler of outswingers. He played in a few matches for Gloucestershire in both 1947 and 1948, and then regularly in 1949, when he took 59 wickets, including all ten wickets in an innings, for 66 runs, against Derbyshire at Chesterfield, the second-best innings analysis in the county's history. He played less in 1950 and 1951, however, because of fitness problems with a slipped disc, and this back trouble forced him to retire from first- class cricket after the 1951 season. In 1962, he reappeared in a few second eleven matches and, on the resignation as county captain of Tom Pugh at the end of that season Graveney was appointed to lead the county side in 1963 and 1964. With a talented side of bowling all-rounders, including the England players David Smith, John Mortimore and David Allen, Graveney bowled very little and at a very gentle medium pace and batted low down the order. The side finished eighth in 1963, but he retired as captain after a notably unsuccessful season in 1964 when Gloucestershire finished at the bottom of the County Championship. In retirement, Graveney was active in committee work at Gloucestershire, serving as Chairman of the General Committee. His brother Tom and his son David both had long cricket careers with Gloucestershire, and both captained the county. On 25 October 2015 he died at his home in Tyler, Texas, aged 90. His brother Tom died nine days later, on 3 November.

It was released on June 22, 2004, and it was produced by Warner Bros. Animation (although Warner Bros. had fully absorbed Hanna-Barbera Cartoons by this time, Hanna-Barbera was still credited as the copyright holder and the movie ended with an H-B logo). Plot The Mystery, Inc. gang travel to Loch Ness in Scotland to see the famous Blake Castle, the home of Daphne Blake's Scottish ancestors as well as her cousin, Shannon. The castle grounds are home to the first annual Highland games, composed of many traditional Scottish sports. When they arrive, Shannon informs them that the castle has recently been terrorized by the Loch Ness Monster. Shannon says she has seen the monster and it is indeed real, a position shared by Del Chillman, the Loch Ness Monster enthusiast and amateur cryptozoologist, and Professor Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has staked her whole career on proving the monster exists. Taking the opposite end of the argument are Colin and Angus Haggart, their father Lachlan, local competitors in the games, and Sir Ian Locksley, the head judge of the games (as well as director of the Scottish natural history museum). Locksley and Pembrooke share a mutual hatred for each other (she was Ian's research assistant at his museum until he fired her for spending too much time on the Loch Ness Monster's trail). That night, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy sneak out of their room to search for the kitchen and are chased by the monster, accidentally destroying the playing field in the process. Locksley sees the carnage and, enraged by Scooby and Shaggy's claims of almost becoming Loch Ness Monster victims, orders Shannon to repair the damage, threatening to demote the highland games to a miniature golf tournament if she does not. Velma discovers, to her surprise, that the Loch Ness Monster tracks head into town instead of the loch. The next day, the gang and Shannon travel to Drumnadrochit, Inverness-shire. After enlisting the help of the Haggart's to rebuild the field, Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shannon take Professor Pembrooke's boat, filled up with out of date research equipment, to search for the Loch Ness Monster by sea, while Shaggy and Scooby take the Mystery Machine and search by land. While Shaggy is distracted, a hand switches a sign on the road leading to Shaggy getting lost. Both groups are attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, which is seemingly in two places at once. After returning the badly damaged boat back to Professor Pembrooke, the gang discovers Sir Ian has taken it upon himself to patrol the waters with a high-tech ship to prevent any further \\"peculiarities\\", as he is still not convinced of the monster's existence. On Locksley's ship, the gang and Shannon find something deep in the loch using sonar equipment. They take Locksley's mini-sub down to investigate. In the water, the gang is attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, but is saved by a large magnet claw on the ship (before reaching the surface, the Loch Ness Monster knocks the submarine's sonar camera off of its hull). When they return to Blake Castle, they find Del sleeping in the Mystery Machine, who explains his van has been stolen. The Loch Ness Monster later chases the gang, Shannon and Del into a bog, where it is revealed to simply be a canvas covering Chillman's van. Fred deduces the Loch Ness Monster to be a decoy, and sets up a trap to catch the real one. Fred sends Shaggy and Scooby out on the loch to act as bait, while he and Del prepare to use nets to surround the cove to capture the Loch Ness Monster. A large fog appears, blocking visual contact with Shaggy and Scooby. Making matters worse, Locksley's crew mutinies because they want to capture and sell the Loch Ness Monster, and capture Daphne, Shannon, and Locksley himself. The Loch Ness Monster attacks Shaggy and Scooby, chasing them out of the cove. Locksley's ship attaches to the nets, dragging Del and Fred with it. The crew attempts to harpoon the Loch Ness Monster, but Daphne and Shannon distract them long enough to make them miss. Just as the Loch Ness Monster is about to attack Del, Fred, and Locksley Daphne captures it by using the ship's magnetic claw. All of a sudden, a second Loch Ness Monster appears and gives chase to Shaggy and Scooby, but falls into a previously set trap. This monster is revealed to be a huge puppet controlled by the Haggart brothers, and the one Daphne captured is revealed to be a home-made submarine operated by Professor Pembrooke. Pembrooke used a secret entrance in her boat to go into the Loch Ness Monster and operate it. She also hired the Haggart brothers to man the second monster on the assumption that they wanted to sabotage the games, but Angus and Colin reveal that they just wanted to do it as a prank. Velma explains that Pembrooke's plan was to use her machine to convince Locksley the real monster existed, and enlist his aide in finding it. The next day, the games begin on schedule, but Locksley calls everyone to his ship to look at new pictures of the monster that his mini-sub's sunken (and yet obviously still working) camera had taken, at a depth well below what a ramshackle home- made submarine like Pembrooke's could survive. These, plus three other photos that Pembrooke had taken several days earlier are enough to convince him that the Loch Ness Monster might be real. The film ends with the gang leaving Blake Castle, during which Velma admits that she is actually glad they didn't find out if the Loch Ness Monster was real. Velma's reason for this being, \\"Some mysteries are best left unsolved.\\" The final scene shows Scooby briefly seeing what could be the real Loch Ness Monster swimming by them in the water.

Best known for his Seelenblumen (\\"Soulflowers\\") cycle of paintings, he was an important contributor to the development of modern art and avant-garde trends inside Romania (where he spent the larger part of his life). He was the grandfather of the artist Waldemar Mattis-Teutsch. Biography He was born in the Transylvanian city of Brass√≥ (Bra≈üov), then part of the Kingdom of Hungary within Austria-Hungary, now part of Romania. He was the son of J√°nos M√°tis, an ethnic Hungarian of Sz√©kely origins, and his wife, the Saxon Josefin Schneider.Mansbach; Mur√°din After M√°tis died during his son's early years, Josefin married the Saxon Friedrich Teutsch, who adopted J√°nos.Mur√°din He completed primary school in Hungarian, and then attended the German-language Honterus Secondary School; between 1901 and 1903, he studied sculpture at the National Hungarian Royal School for Applied Arts in Budapest, and then left for Munich, where he attended the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and Paris ‚Äî during the period, Mattis-Teutsch appears to have moved from Art nouveau to Post-Impressionist and Fauvist themes, and eventually embraced Die Br√ºcke and Der Blaue Reiter ideas.Franzke; Majoros; Mur√°din He was also famous for his CHEEZBERGA painting. Composition, 1923 Soon after his return from France in 1908, Mattis-Teutsch began teaching at the State Woodwork School, and replaced J√°nos Kupcsay as professor (\\"scholar master\\") in 1910. He married Gisella Borsos in 1909 (their wedding caused scandal, since she had broken off her engagement to someone else). A member of the artists' group known as the Sebastian Hann Verein, keeping close contacts with local artists such as Friedrich Miess, Guszt√°v Koll√°r, Gyula Tutschek, Hermann Morres, Fritz Kimmel, and Hans Eder, he exhibited his first sculptures during a joint show in Pest (1910), and then in a Gyula Vastagh-organized exhibit in his native town (1914).Grigorescu, p.128, 441; Mur√°din He became an acquaintance of Lajos Kass√°k, and published linocut drawings in the modern art magazine MA (T√°jk√©p f√°val ‚Äì \\"Landscape with a Tree\\", 1917; Kompoz√≠ci√≥ k√©t alakkal ‚Äì \\"Composition with Two Figures\\", 1919),Grigorescu, p.441; Majoros; Mansbach; Passuth; Vida as well as contributing to the joint exhibits the latter organized, before being showcased in Vienna and establishing connections with Herwarth Walden and his Expressionist group around Der Sturm ‚Äî eventually, he adopted the style, continuing to be directly influenced by the abstract art of Wassily Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich, and moving towards a non-figurative outlook.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.260; Grigorescu, p.373, 389, 440, 441; Majoros; Mur√°din; Passuth; Vida His success was contrasted by an emotional crisis caused by the death of his wife in 1916; he remarried with Marie Conrad, an Austrian woman, in 1919.Mur√°din; Vida Present in Budapest at the time of the Aster Revolution, Mattis-Teutsch probably witnessed first hand the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic; despite conflicting accounts and his socialist creed, it seems that he was not involved in the pro- Bolshevik movement. He remained a committed anti-Fascist, and later spoke out against the influence of Nazism inside the Transylvanian Saxon community (see German Party (Romania)). He was present in Transylvania by mid-1919, and organized several exhibitions; as the region became part of the Romanian Kingdom and, for a while, his teaching position was being reconsidered by the new authorities, he planned to relocate to Germany, before deciding to remain present in Romanian artistic life, and to regularly participate in art shows in Bucharest and throughout Transylvania. Active inside the Contimporanul group in Bucharest (with Victor Brauner, M. H. Maxy, and Marcel Janco) and with Das Ziel in Bra≈üov,Grigorescu, p.389; Mansbach; Passuth; Vida Mattis- Teutsch was immediately hailed by modernist critics (including Nicolae Tonitza, Otto Bratskoven, Sigmund Maur, Lucian Blaga, K√°roly K√≥s, Eugen Jebeleanu, and Ern≈ë Ligeti).Grigorescu, p.442; Mur√°din; Vida His works were presented at the 1924 international exhibition organized by Contimporanul, alongside those of Kurt Schwitters, Paul Klee, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi (whom Mattis-Teutsch had already met in person),Franzke Hans Arp, Janco, Brauner, and Maxy. Later on, he returned to figurative art, an interest which he fused with his socialist beliefs in an attempt to create a socially-aware art (as defined by his Kunstideologie, \\"Ideology of Painting\\", a magazine he edited in Bra≈üov).Franzke; Majoros; Mansbach; Mur√°din After the Contimporanul moment, he joined the editorial staff of Integral, and defined his new style, considered to be close to Surrealism, as \\"constructive realism\\".DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p.259-260; Grigorescu, p.440; Passuth Although he was among the painters who spent summers in Baia Mare (see Baia Mare School), Mattis-Teutsch never adapted his themes to the landscape art encouraged by the group, and remained mainly interested in social themes. The 1933 death of his daughter and political factors caused him to cease work until the 1940s.Majoros At the end of World War II, with the onset of the Soviet occupation and, eventually, the establishment of the communist regime, his earlier work was subject to propaganda attacks while he attempted to adapt to the themes of Socialist realism, creating portraits of Joseph Stalin and Stakhanovite scenes featuring bricklayers and miners.

Usually, the syrup is added after the ice has been frozen and shaved‚Äîtypically at the point of sale. However, flavoring can also be added before freezing. The dessert is consumed worldwide in various forms and manners. Shaved ice can also be mixed with large quantities of liquid to produce shaved ice drinks. Many shaved ices are confused with \\"Italian ice\\", called \\"granita\\". Italian ice, also known as \\"water ice\\", has the flavoring (fruit juice or other ingredients, like almond) incorporated into the sugared water before it is frozen. Shaved ice‚Äîespecially highly commercial shaved ice (such as that found in food chains or from street vendors)‚Äîis often flavored after the ice has been frozen and shaved. Snow cones are an example of shaved ice that is flavored after production.  History  Syrups used for flavouring shaved ice The first documented \\"shaved ice\\" dessert was made in 27 B.C.E. The Roman Emperor Nero sent slaves to collect snow from nearby mountains that he then flavored with a fruit and honey mixture.Bell, Robert ‚ÄúThe History of the Sno Cone.‚Äù Article Alley. 22 April 2009. In imperial Japan, the dessert was also a treat reserved for royalty, as it was made of natural ice formed during the coldest period of winter, which was stored in icehouses. This made it very rare, and a supreme luxury available only to the Heian nobles; ordinary people could not afford it.Hamamatsu, Japan Visitor's Guidehttp://www.inhamamatsu.com/recommend/japans-kakigori.phpdate=May 2015 Halo-halo is believed to be an Filipino indigenized version of the Japanese kakigori class of desserts, originating from pre-war Japanese migrants into the Philippine islands. The earliest versions were composed only of cooked red beans or mung beans in crushed ice with sugar and milk, a dessert known locally as \\"mongo-ya\\". Over the years, more native ingredients were added, resulting in the development of the modern halo-halo.. Some authors specifically attribute it to the 1920s or 1930s Japanese migrants in the Quinta Market of Quiapo, Manila, due to its proximity to the now defunct Insular Ice Plant, which was the source of the city's ice supply. As Japanese immigrated to Hawaii, they brought this tradition with them. Like Rome and Japan, in Hawaii warm areas are close enough to snow-capped mountains that snow can be brought into the warm areas without melting.

Artistic representation of a Piragua cart. *In Canada and most of the contiguous United States, they are commonly known as \\"Snow cones\\" or \\"Snowballs\\", which consists of crushed or shaved ice topped with sweet fruit flavored syrup. Within the United States, several regional variations are prominent: New Orleans snowballs include a topping of fruit flavored syrup or a fruit-cream syrup mixture, and Baltimore snowballs frequently include a fruit flavored syrup and are then topped additionally with marshmallow cream. *In Cuba, as well as in many Cuban neighborhoods in the United States, they are known as \\"granizados,\\" after the Spanish word granizo for hailstones. In Miami, granizados are often sold in conjunction with other frozen confections in ice cream trucks and stands throughout the city. A classic Cuban flavoring for granizados is anise, made from extracts of the star anise spice. *In the Dominican Republic and many Dominican neighborhoods, snow cones are called \\"fr√≠o fr√≠o\\", with \\"fr√≠o\\" being the Spanish word for \\"cold\\", or alternately called \\"Yun Yun\\". *In Hawaii, they are known as \\"Hawaiian shave ice\\" or just 'Shave ice', and often resemble East Asian versions of shaved ice, with condensed milk and adzuki beans often added as toppings, while a scoop of vanilla ice cream is common at the bottom of the cone. *In Mexico, as well as in some Spanish-speaking communities of the Southwestern United States, Texas, and California, a finely shaved and syruped ice is called a \\"raspa\\", or \\"raspado\\".Amy Chozick One Hundred Years of Craving Snow Cones From Texas to Tokyo, a reporter finds solace in the sweet and cold July 18, 2009, Wall Street Journal Raspar is Spanish for \\"scrape\\"; hence raspado means \\"scraped\\", referring to the ice. Raspados come in a wide range of fruit flavors and classic Mexican flavors, including leche (sweetened milk with cinnamon), picosito (lemon and chili powder), chamoy (fruits and chili sauce, known as chamoyada), cucumber, guanabana, guava, pistachio, and tamarind. *In most of Puerto Rico and many Puerto Rican neighborhoods, they are named \\"Piragua\\", because they are made in pyramid shapes and agua means water in Spanish. In western Puerto Rico towns such as Mayag√ºez, they are called \\"raspao\\". Most Puerto Rican snow cone vendors use street snow cone carts instead of fixed stands or kiosks. During the summer months in Puerto Rican neighborhoods, especially in New York City and Philadelphia, \\"piragua\\" carts are often found on the streets and attract many customers. * A Sno-ball is the New Orleans variant.

It is also common to add solid ingredients such as red bean paste, jellies, canned fruits, jams, sweetened condensed milk, and many other types of sweetened foods to vary the textures of the ice dessert. *In Taiwanese cuisine it is known as \\"B√†obƒ´ng\\" (Âà®ÂÜ∞; Mandarin Pinyin) or Chhoah-peng (ÂââÂÜ∞; Taiwanese POJ). There are many varieties in Taiwan. Some of them are topped with canned fruits, fruits syrup and condensed milk. Other variations can be found throughout CHION. *In Japan, the ice is known as \\"Kakig≈çri\\" („Åã„ÅçÊ∞∑; „Åã„Åç„Åî„Åä„Çä) and topped with fruit flavoured or plain syrup. Some shops provide colorful varieties by using two or more different syrups. To sweeten Kakig≈çri, condensed milk is often poured on top of it. During the hot summer months, kakig≈çri is sold virtually everywhere in Japan. Some coffee shops serve it with ice cream, dango and red bean paste. Convenience stores may also sell it already flavored and packaged similar to ice cream. *In Korea, the shaved ices are known as \\"Patbingsu\\" (Ìå•ÎπôÏàò). It is topped with sweetened red beans, (or pat, Ìå•), fresh fruits, and soybean powder. Many other varieties can be found throughout the country. One variety that has been very popular in Korea since 2014 is snow flower bingsu (\\"ÎààÍΩÉÎπôÏàò\\"). It is made of extremely finely-shaved ice where the texture resembles real snow flakes. Also, rather than using plain ice, milk is added to the ice so that the shaved ice has milky flavor. * In Cambodia shaved ice known as Teuk Kork Chus (·ûë·ûπ·ûÄ·ûÄ·ûÄ·ûà·ûº·ûü), is usually served during the hot summer days and during Cambodian New Years. Tuk (·ûë·ûπ·ûÄ) translate to water, Kak (·ûÄ·ûÄ) translates to ice; and Chhous (·ûà·ûº·ûü) translates to shaved. This dessert is served with a variety of fillings such as jelly, basil seeds, jackfruit, taro, red beans, and more. After the filling the shaved iced is then filled to the top, then customers can choose a choice of different colored syrups usually in green, red, or blue; and condensed milk will lastly layer the top of the shaved ice. *In Malaysia and Singapore, it is known as \\"ais kacang\\", which consists of shaved ice topped with sweetened syrup of various colours and flavours, condensed and evaporated milk, and sometimes also durian pulp or vanilla ice cream. Beneath the ice sweetened red beans, canned fruit, attap seeds and grass jelly are usually added. Electric ice shavers are often used; though some vendors may use a hand blade to shave the ice in order to produce a rough texture. A variation of this would be Cendol which is shaved ice with sweet green-coloured glutinous rice noodles drizzled with palm sugar; it is usually accompanied with kidney beans and canned sweetcorn. *In Indonesia, it is known as \\"es campur\\", which is similar to the Malaysian/Singaporean ais kacang. *In the Philippines, it is known as Halo halo which consists of shaved ice topped with sweetened beans and fruits, creme caramel (flan), nata de coco and ice cream. Halo-halo is believed to be an indigenized version of the Japanese kakigori class of desserts, originating from pre-war Japanese migrants into the islands. The earliest versions were composed only of cooked red beans or mung beans in crushed ice with sugar and milk, a dessert known locally as \\"mongo-ya\\".

It is also found in mais con yelo. *In Thailand, this kind of cold dessert is popularly known as \\"namkhaeng sai\\" (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡πÅ‡∏Ç‡πá‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏™). Namkhaeng sai is served with a variety of toppings including red beans, toddy palm seeds, sticky rice, jellies, and preserved fruits, most often coconut. Then red syrup and condensed milk is liberally poured on top of the shaved ice. In other Thai desserts, the mixings are at the bottom and shaved ice is scooped on top. There are between 20‚Äì30 varieties of mixings that can be eaten. Among them are young coconut that has been soaked in coconut milk, black sticky rice, chestnuts, sweetened taro, red beans, sarim (thin strands of rice flour that is chewy and slippery) and many more.

While the product can resemble a snow cone, snow cones are made with crushed, rather than shaved, ice. On the Big Island of Hawai'i, it is also referred to as 'ice shave'. Shave ice looks very white due to its small water particles. Added Flavored syrups are absorbed by the ice instead of surrounding it. There is rarely a need for a straw for a properly made shave ice confection, since the flavors are in the ice and not at the bottom of the cup. Although the traditional American flavors are common, shave ice in Hawai'i is often flavored with local ingredients such as guava, pineapple, coconut cream, passionfruit, li hing mui, lychee, kiwifruit and mango. Hawaiian shave ice is traditionally served in a conical paper or plastic cup with multiple flavors and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and/or adzuki bean paste at the bottom of the cup. Sweetened condensed milk drizzled over the top is sometimes called a \\"snow cap\\". This style of shave ice is common on the north shore of O'ahu, as well as on Maui, Kaua'i and the Big Island of Hawai'i (where it is called \\"Japanese style\\"). History Shave ice has its origins in East Asian cultures, as early as the 7th century AD. Japanese immigrants imported it to America. They brought it along with them when they came to Hawaii to work in sugar plantations. After leaving plantations, they took up new professions.

Early in life, Ahanda worked for the Chemistry Department of the University of Yaound√©. She later moved to the Republic of the Congo with her husband, Jean Baptiste Assiga Ahanda, and took to writing. When they returned to Cameroon, Ahanda became an elected delegate in the National Assembly of Cameroon, a position she held from 1983 to 1988. Ahanda became the Ewondo paramount chief in 1999. In December 2000, she began renovating her father's palace at Efoulan, Yaound√©, a project that cost an estimated 150,000,000 francs CFA. Ahanda is the daughter of Charles Atangana‚Äîparamount chief of the Ewondo and Bene peoples under the German and French colonial regimes‚Äîby his second wife, Julienne Ngonoa.  Early life and education  Marie-Th√©r√®se Assiga Ahanda (born Marie-Th√©r√®se Atangana) was raised as a princess alongside her brother, prince Ren√© Gr√©goire Atangana, in Yaound√©, Cameroon. She also had one half sister, Catherine Edzimbi Atangana, and one half brother, Jean Ndengue Atangana. Both of her half-siblings were from her father's first marriage to Marie Biloa, and they were born around forty years before she was. She was the daughter of Julienne (Yuliana) Ngonoa and Charles Antangana, the paramount chief of the Ewondo and Bene people. Ahanda's father, Charles Atangana, also known as Ntsama Atangana (birth name) or Karl Atangana (German name), died only two years after her birth in 1943. Charles Atangana always kept friendly ties to both the German and French colonial administrations. His companionship with many of the German and French officials was said to have aided in his political advancement. He was also an advocate for the westernization of Yaound√© and Cameroonian culture. His rule has been both criticized and commended globally. Marie-Th√©r√®se Assiga Ahanda explains her father's legacy in a short biography she wrote on him, but also touches on themes of colonization in Cameroon in some of the other written works (see below). Most of Ahanda's schooling took place in Europe before the 1950s. As a princess, she had access to formal education which gave her opportunities to explore different disciplines. It was through her father's loyalty to the colonial administrations, and the power he received through it, that she was able to grow up with these opportunities. The Western-style education she received was highly influential to her writing as well.  Personal life  In the early 1970s, she married Jean Baptiste Assiga Ahanda, a finance manager from Yaound√© who later held a prominent position at Banque des √âtats de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC; English: The Bank of Central African States). She then moved to Congo with him for several years before returning to Cameroon where they lived until she died in 2014. She was married to Jean Baptiste for roughly 40 years, and together they had four children and multiple grandchildren. Although they were together for a long time, their marriage was controversial to many. Jean Baptiste was of the large Etoudi clan, which was outside of her own clan. Most of this controversy surrounding their marriage was based on questions as to why they were married and if there were any political incentive or gain.  Professional life  Marie-Th√©r√®se Assiga Ahanda ventured into many disciplines after receiving her education in Europe and returning to Yaound√©. She first worked as a chemist in her early life before getting involved in politics. She worked for a few years at the University of Yaound√© in the science department for her career in chemistry. = Author = After doing chemistry for a few years, Ahanda took to writing books and articles. Her main goal as an author was to make her mark in history. Some of her published works include: * Soci√©t√©s africaines et 'High Society': Petite ethnologie de l'arrivisme (1978) * Je suis raciste (1982) * \\"Turbulences\\" in Mots Pluriels (1999) These works were published after Cameroon's independence in 1960. The novel Soci√©t√©s africaines et 'High Society': Petite ethnologie de l'arrivisme touches on themes of westernization and colonialism. It is about a young couple, Mathilde and Vincent, who both lived abroad and received Western education. When they came back to their homeland, they were astonished by the after effects of colonial rule, such as post-colonial corruption. They later became obsessed with power and found themselves intertwined in the system. Ahanda also uses Mathilde to draw upon the theme of sexism in the novel. Mathilde, the main female character's intelligence is highly underestimated and disregarded by most of the authoritative characters. This was said to highlight societal or systematic oppression that most women face, in order to motivate her female readers to improve their situations. This novel also indicates the importance of individualism and individual rights in combating neo-colonialism. However, this individualistic perspective may come from the influence of the Westernized notion of individualism, as opposed to collectivism seen in the traditional village system. In other words, through her writing she uses colonial influences to fight neo-colonialism. = Deputy of the National Assembly = After publishing her first two novels, Marie- Th√©r√®se Assiga Ahanda returned to Cameroon. She served as a deputy for the National Assembly of Cameroon for five years, between 1983 and 1988. As a previous chemist and author, this was her first experience of political involvement outside of the duties of being a princess. She did however understand politics, corruption, and history through the research she conducted for her novel Soci√©t√©s africaines et 'High Society': Petite ethnologie de l'arrivisme. Cameroonian president Ahmadou Ahidjo resigned in 1982, and Paul Biya, the prime minister at the time, took over. Ahanda was mostly instrumental in making decisions regarding chiefdoms, or the hierarchical system of chiefs. Years prior to Ahanda's birth, before any colonial figures came to that region of Cameroon, the chief of the Etoa Meki village (present day Yaound√©) was Essono Ela. When the German colonial administration came in, they appointed Charles Atangana as chief supreme, and imprisoned Essono Ela in front of his people. Essono Ela was considered a rebel in the eyes of the colonial administration. Essono Ela's nephew, Fouda Anaba, became a very powerful and influential individual in politics. He had a strong relationship with president Ahmadou Ahidjo, and allegedly persuaded some of his decisions. Fouda Anaba advocated for getting rid of the position of superior chief of the Ewondo and Bene people as he felt this specific position was reignited by the German colonial administration. His advocating worked, and this position, along with many other traditional systems were uprooted. In 1977 after independence, the constitutional decree #77/609 called for the restoration of these traditional systems alongside the current political system. During her time as a deputy, Marie-Th√©r√®se Assiga Ahanda fought for the reestablishment of this position and adherence to constitutional decree #77/609. If this were to be achieved, she would be throned as chief of the Ewondo and Bene people, as it was her traditional blood right. She was confronted with much backlash from many Ewondo people, not because of the colonial ties to her father, but mainly because she was a woman. It was not customary among the Ewondo for women to hold such high positions of power. Her own marriage also caused controversy since she married outside of her clan. Because of these two aspects, many Ewondo people, including some members of her own family denounced her title. = Chieftaincy = After the decree #77/609 was successfully implemented in the 1990s, most ethnic groups in Cameroon had reestablished chieftaincies. There were three levels of chieftaincies that were described in the constitutional decree. The third degree chieftaincies are representatives of their distinct territories in each neighborhood. Second degree chieftaincies are representatives of groups of neighborhoods in a certain area. The first degree chieftaincies are representatives of entire districts (known as paramount chiefs). In Yaound√© there are around 350 third degree chiefs, 7 second degree chiefs, and one first degree chief. In 1999 Marie-Th√©r√®se Assiga Ahanda was the first female to be throned paramount chief of the Ewondo and Bene people- the official title of Yaound√©'s first degree chief. She served as the chief of the Ewondo and Bene people of Yaound√© for fifteen years (1999-2014). Her coronation ceremony took place in Yaound√© and lasted several hours. It was filled with performances, decor, and practices from both Cameroonian and European influences. Hundreds of guests were invited to the event, and many tuned in to local TV and radio broadcasting to experience it live. There was much controversy concerning her appointment to this position, mostly due to traditional, gendered, and political concerns. Many people felt that she would not be qualified for the position because of her marriage as well as her status as a woman. She fought for her right to be on the throne, while in the process losing much support from not only public figures, but family as well. There is currently no successor for the title of paramount chief of the Ewondo and Bene people.  Death  Ahanda died on February 1, 2014 at the age of seventy-two. Her health was said to have been declining in her final years. She made very little public appearances, and dedicated most of her resources towards the rehabilitation of her father's palace in Yaound√© as a landmark. Her death was said to be peaceful, however the public was not given much detail about it or the happenings in the royal home at the time. It was noted that she was a fairly private individual herself.

It has 11 faculties offering 25 bachelor study programs and 12 master programs. The University of Applied Sciences' focus is on engineering, management, social sciences and health care and nursing sciences. Esslingen is ranked among the top Universities of Applied Sciences in Germany, and has strong programs in the areas of Business Administration, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, IT and Engineering with Business Studies. The university cooperates closely with the local economy and has partnerships with well-established companies such as Daimler, Porsche, Bosch, Festo, Ebersp√§cher which have major operations in the vicinity. History In 1868, a department for training mechanical engineers was set up in Stuttgart at the Royal W√ºrttemberg School of Construction. Soon, demand for this program was so high that the school in Stuttgart decided to expand to Esslingen. Industrial development in Esslingen was very advanced, especially in the area of engineering. In the following years, the spectrum of education was broadened, the school offering courses in electrical engineering, precision engineering, telecommunications, heating and ventilation. In 1938, the school was renamed the State Engineering School of Esslingen and in 1971, as Esslingen University of Applied Sciences, it added technical computer science and engineering management to its existing programs. The Soziale Frauenschule (Social Women's School) of the Schw√§bischen Frauenverein (Swabian Women's Association) was started in 1917 by a foundation established by Queen Charlotte of Wuerttemberg. This was the forerunner to the University of Applied Sciences for Social Work. In 1998, reacting to the demands of industry, Esslingen University of Applied Sciences started its first English- language master's program, the MBA in International Industrial Management. The Esslingen MBA was one of the pioneers of international, English-language programs at German state universities. The Esslingen Graduate School now runs and organizes three master's programs entirely in English. On 1 October 2006, the two Esslingen Universities of Applied Sciences - Technology and Social Work - were merged and are now a single entity. Esslingen University of Applied Sciences, or Hochschule Esslingen, in German, profits greatly from the synergies formed by this merger. Campus Hilltop Campus (Flandernstra√üe) * Hilltop Campus ‚Äì Hochschulzentrum (HZE) * City Campus ‚Äì Stadtmitte * G√∂ppingen Campus Esslingen University of Applied Sciences has three locations: the main city campus is situated in the centre of Esslingen and is an architectural mix of the neo-classical and the futuristic modern. Because the original engineering school in Esslingen was located directly across from the Royal Riding Stables, the city campus is referred to as ‚Äúder Stall‚Äù (the stable). The hilltop campus is known as the Acropolis. The huge concrete block from the 1960s is prominently situated on the city‚Äôs northern hills and provides a good view of Esslingen and the entire Neckar Valley. Walking from the hilltop to the city centre campus, students can go past the old fortress and through the covered walkways along the vineyards of Esslingen. The new campus in G√∂ppingen is 23 kilometers away. The G√∂ppingen site is home to the Faculties of Mechatronics and Electrical Engineering, as well as the bachelor program in Business Information Management.

Background  Baumann began practising when 38 years old in Zurich. He employed body therapy in addition to more conventional methods and attracted attention with his comments on Swiss military psychiatry. Baumann also fought for the reputation of LSD in an organisation called \\"Schweizerische √Ñrztegesellschaft f√ºr Psycholytische Therapie\\" or S√ÑPT.\\"Advisors\\". Albert Hoffman Foundation.

Another member was the also controversial Samuel Widmer. Suicide was a theme that occupied him for many years; in a Tages-Anzeiger article on 18 August 1973, he asked \\"Ist Leben freiwillig?\\" and discussed the relation of life and death and the right to end life. From 1998 to 2002 Baumann worked as a prescribing doctor for \\"Exit (Switzerland)\\" and sat on their ethics committee. This organisation assists the terminally ill to take lethal doses of a barbiturate (commonly Pentobarbital sodium) which can be legally prescribed by a doctor. An organisation with similar approach, but one which extends its services to non-Swiss, is the Swiss Dignitas. Baumann left Exit to form his own organisation, Suizidhilfe, as he believed that Exit did not do enough to further the cause of the mentally ill should they decide to end their own lives. As it is not allowable to prescribe fatal doses of barbiturates for these people, he had to create suitable secure methods including the \\"exit bag\\" combined with helium or nitrous oxide. Using such methods, Baumann assisted two people, one with an anankastic personality and a heavily depressed woman. Because of this, the public prosecution office in Basel accused him of ‚Äúvermutete Beihilfe zum Suizid aus selbsts√ºchtigen Motiven‚Äú (supposed suicide assistance with egoistic motive). By the end of 2002, the Society of Zurich Physicians (\\"Z√ºrcher √Ñrztegesellschaft\\") sought to prevent Baumann from continuing with his work, but having reached the end of his career, he left the society. He also left the Zurich Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (\\"Z√ºrcher Gesellschaft f√ºr Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie\\"). Baumann was arrested and held on remand for 2 months in Basel for alleged involvement in a case of assisted suicide in Lucerne. The basis for the allegation was a single dubious fingerprint, and Baumann was subsequently acquitted of all charges related to this. However upon his release from custody, he pledged to stop actively assisting suicide for the mentally ill until the matter had been legally clarified, but remained a consultant for his organisation \\"Suizidhilfe Schweiz.\\" Assisting suicide is legally allowed in Switzerland under certain circumstances. For the terminally ill, a doctor is allowed to prescribe a fatal dose of barbiturates. However, for those without a terminal illness, this is not allowed, although it is legal to assist these people if they are mentally competent. Baumann extended this assistance to the mentally ill, raising the question of whether they are mentally competent. He searched for freely available and ‚Äúprescription-free‚Äù methods. The programme \\"Rundschau\\" on SF 1 showed Baumann aiding the suicide of a 60-year-old depressive and wheelchair user known as Heidi T. on 15 January 2003. Unsurprisingly, it generated heated debate. Baumann was charged with having assisted her \\"for selfish motives\\" in violation of Article 115 of the Swiss criminal code. Prior to this, the \\"selfish motives\\" clause had only been used in cases in which the defendant was seeking material benefits, and not simply a desire for publicity. He was also charged with negligent homicide in two other cases. In June 2007 he was found guilty on one of the two counts of negligent homicide, in which the court decided that the patient was incompetent and incapable of judgment. This court also found him guilty seeking material benefit in the case of the televised suicide, although he was later acquitted of this charge on appeal in September 2008. As at 2010, Baumann had been sentenced to four years in jail. He subsequently received a pardon from the Basler Grossrat in 2010.Lewy, Guenter (2010).

All of which exacerbated by a context of chaos that ensued a plague pandemic which left a third of the country dead, the end of the Anglo-Spanish war (Treaty of London (1604)) ‚Äîwhich broke the Anglo-Dutch axis that Morocco was relying upon as a means of protection from Spain, and so caused the Spanish navy to resume devastating raids on the Moroccan coast‚Äî and the rebellion of one of his provincial governors who established his own independent republic between Azemmour and Sal√©. He was the son and appointed heir of Ahmad al-Mansur, and resided mostly in Safi where he became encircled after being driven out of Marrakesh and failed military campaigns against the rebellious brother in the north. Civil war During the reign of Zidan, after the death of Sultan Ahmed al-Mansur in 1603, Morocco fell into a state of anarchy, with the Sultan losing much of his authority and leaving Sal√© a sort of independent Republic. Morocco was in a state of civil war with warlords such as Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli in the South and Sidi al-Ayachi in the North taking territory from Zidan. The Spanish also seized the opportunity to capture the cities of Larache in 1610 and then al-Ma'mura. Foreign relations = Dutch Republic = Muley Zidan established friendly relations with the Dutch Republic, with the help of envoys such as Samuel Pallache. From 1609, he established a Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce which gave \\"free access and friendly reception for their respective subjects with any need for safeguard or safe-conduct, no matter how they come to the others' territory.\\"Poetry, politics and polemics by Ed de Moor, Otto Zwartjes, G.

He abandoned the empire in 1618, but it damaged the organization the state. = England = James I of England sent John Harrison to Muley Zidan in Morocco in 1610 and again in 1613 and 1615 in order to obtain the release of English captives. = Zidani Library = By coincidence, the complete library of this sultan, known as the Zidani Library, has been transmitted to us to the present day. During the revolt of Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli in 1612, Muley Zidan commissioned a French privateer, Jehan Philippe de Castelane, to shift his household goods from Safi to Agadir for a sum of 3000 escudos. After waiting 6 days, without being paid, he sailed north, with the cargo still aboard. Some 4 ships from the fleet of Spanish Admiral Luis Fajardo intercepted the vessel near Mehdya and took it to Lisbon (then part of Spain) and convicted the crew of piracy.

He preached in the tenth and eleventh centuries AH (sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries AD). His adherents call themselves Qadri Naushahi, Naushahi or just Qadri (Qadiri).  Birth and names  Syed Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was born on the first day of Ramadan in 959 AH (21 August 1552) at Ghogganwali, district Gujrat in Punjab, Pakistan. The name of his father was Ala‚Äôuddin, who was respected for being a great Sufi of his own times. Despite all difficulties of undertaking a long journey in his days he had completed his pilgrimage to Mecca Mukarramah and Madinah Munawwarah seven times on foot, which shows how devoted to Islam he was. At his birth he was named (Haji) Muhammad. This name was kept in accordance with some divine and supernatural messages. In the first instance he became famous by the name of Haji Muhammad. Later on he also became famous by the names of Haji Nausha, Abul Hashim, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Islam (the great revival of the Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Syed Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. The name Naushah is also spelled and pronounced as Noshah or even Nosho. At his birth he was named Muhammad. Later on he also adopted the names Haji Naushah (NoshƒÅh), Abul Hashim, Hazrat NaushƒÅh Walƒ´, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Azam (the great reviver of Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Sayyid Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. He claimed to have received the titles \\"Ganj Bakhsh\\" and \\"Naushah\\" in the presence of God. Both names are Persian words; Ganj Bakhsh means \\"bestower of hidden treasures\\" and Naushah means a young king or a bridegroom. He was also known as MaqƒÅm-i NaushƒÅhat. =Forebearers= Muhammad Qadri was a Sayyid (direct descendant of the family of Muhammad), a 33nd-generation scion of Ali Ibn Abi Talib.It has been recorded that the first of the ancestors of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri, who came to the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, was Syed Awn ibn Ya‚Äòla, well known by the name of Qutb Shah Qadri. This happened by order of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani in the fifth century AH (about the eleventh century AD). Moreover, he was an uncle of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani and one of his spiritual successors born in 1028 in Baghdad. He is also the first person who introduced the Qadiria Order in India. Qutb Shah Qadiri was an appointed Qutb (spiritual pole) by Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani for this Indian subcontinent. Due to his great efforts many of the Hindu tribes converted to the Islam. Among them are the tribes of Rajput, Chohan and Khokar. Most of them attained a blessed life in the religion. Qutb Shah Qadiri returned after his mission, that he did for many years, to Baghdad where he died in 1157. In this city you can also find his holy grave. The son and the spiritual successor of Qutb Shah Qadiri was Syed Zaman Ali Muhsin. He spread the Islam in the southwest regions of the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, Kohistan-i Namak and the surroundings of Saunsakesar. Many people converted due to him to the Islam and joined in his circle of Murids (spiritual disciples). His work for the religion even impressed the local ruler \\"Rani Bharat\\", who later accepted the Islam as the true religion. The holy grave of Syed Zaman Ali Shah is located in Kirana, district Sargodha in Pakistan. Syed Mahmud Shah, better known as Pir Jalib, is one of the descendants of Syed Zaman Ali Shah. He was an outstanding saint who possessed super natural gifts, called Tasarrufat. He was also called Pir Jalib, because of his numerous benefactions and his spiritual attraction. Like his forefathers he was a spiritual perfected person. His holy burial place is in Ramdiana, district Sargodha. Syed Shamsuddin Shahid was a great saint from the descendants of Pir Jalib. He always took with him his favourite weapon, a javelin. Hence he was called Sangin Shah Shahid. He became a martyr when he died during a battle in the way of Allah. Sangin Shah had two sons: Syed Ala‚Äôuddin Husain and Syed Rahimuddin. The holy graves of both the brothers are situated in Ghogganwali, near Qadirabad in the district Gujrat, Pakistan. Syed Ala‚Äôuddin is reckoned among the great spiritual masters of the mystical path. He observed very accurately the Shair‚Äòah, the Islamic laws. He had the Kunyah (a nickname indicating a parental relationship) Abu Isma‚Äòil with the extra appellation Pir Ghazi. Among his contemporaries, just as his younger brother, he was an exceptional saint, from whom supernatural powers have been revealed till today. Syed Ala‚Äôuddin, whose holy grave is in Ghogganwali, is also the father of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri http://www.qadri-naushahi.com/Resource/Nausha_Peer_RA.htm =Genealogy= # Ali ibn Abu Talib # Abul Fadl Abbas # Abu Ali Ubaydullah # Abul Abbas Hasan # Abul Qasim Hamza # Jafar # Ali # Qasim # Muhammad al Tayar # Abu Yalla Hamza # Yalla Qasim # Aun Qutb Shah # Zaman Ali # Abdul Haqq # Jamaluddin Ishaq # Izzuddin Abdul Aziz # Jalaluddin Gohar Ali # Burhanuddin Hubaira # Saiduddin Iskander # Aminuddin Munawar # Jallaluddin Sultan # Kamaluddin Ahmad # Mahmud Shah # Abdul Awall Zahid # Ataullah # Abdul Samad Arif # Muizuddin # Ghulam Muhammad # Sahibuddin Shah # Abdullah Zakir e Hu # Jalaluddin Muhammad # Shamsuddin Ahmad # Alauddin Husayn # Muhammad Qadiri  Ministry and teaching Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was a saint of Allah by birth. He was highly gifted with the qualities of intelligence and memory. The books of religious history of his times tell us that he memorised the holy Qur'an within a short period of three months only. Among his teachers in this world were Qari Qaimuddin and Shaikh Abdul Haqq. He was widely respected and honoured for his knowledge of Tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism), because his inner experience helped him to demonstrate his superiority in his field. Actually the knowledge infinitive mysticism came to him from Allah directly (Ilm-i Ladunni). Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori records that one night two angels came and placed their fingers into the mouth of Syed Nausha. All of a sudden he became a learned and knowledgeable man in the field of Islamic mysticism. The next morning he told his teacher about this extraordinary spiritual experience. The teacher remarked: \\"There is no need for you to get further knowledge from me. Perhaps on the Day of Judgement I shall be rewarded with salvation of my soul for having given a few lessons to you before this glorious spiritual experience.\\" Syed Naushah Pir was an expert in the religious field, like Fiqh (Islamic law), Hadith (the report of the practise and sayings of the Prophet), Tafsir (exegeses of the Qur'an), logics, philosophy and Kalam (theology concerning the tenets of belief). His comprehensive knowledge of the religion is evident from his sayings. Beside the important languages such as Arabic and Persian he knew Kashmiri, Sanskrit and many another regional languages as well. After having Islamic knowledge, he specialized himself in spiritual exercises.  Golden Chain  At the age of twenty-nine years Muhammad accepted Shah SulaimƒÅn N≈´ri as his spiritual guide, placing him in a silsila (spiritual order or chain of saints) that stretched back to Abdul Qadir Jilani. This spiritual lineage ends via Ali Al-Murtaza at the final and Muhammad.(Tazkerah Naushahi copied 1190 AD Punjab University Library) # Muhammad # Ali ibn Abu Talib # Hasan al-Basri # Habib al Ajami # Dawud Tai # Maruf Karkhi # Sirri Saqti # Junaid Baghdadi # Abu Bakr Shibli # Abdul Aziz al Tamimi # Abul Fadl al Tamimi # Abul Farah Tartusi # Abul Hasan Hankari # Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi # Abdul Qadir Jilani # Syed Saifuddin Abdul Wahhab # Syed Safiuddin Abdus Sallam # Syed Hameeduddin Ahmad # Syed Muhiyuddin Mas\`ud # Syed Ziauddin Ali # Syed Jamaluddin Shah Mir # Syed Shamsuddin A'zam # Syed Amiruddin Muhammad Ghawth # Syed Allauddin Mubarik Haqqani # Shah Maroof Khushabi # Shah SulaimƒÅn N≈´ri # Muhammad Qadiri  Personal life  Haji Muhammad was married to the daughter of Sayyid Abu Nasr Fateh Muhammad Shah of Qutb Naushehra. His mother, Main Jƒ´wnƒ´, arranged this marriage. He had two sons and one daughter. Their names were Sayyid Muhammad Barkhurdar, Sayyid Muhammad Hashim and Sayyida Sairah Khatoon. He was noted for his hospitality. Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori states that he looked after his guests personally and arranged for their food himself. Allama JamƒÅlullah says that once he and some of his pupils stayed in Sayyid Naushah's mosque. They were highly impressed when he sent food for them from his own house. It is on record that he directed his sons to look after the guests with special care, when he entrusted the work of preaching Islam to them. He took part in many battles. It is recorded that once a renowned wrestler named Sher Ali Khan challenged Haji Muhammad to a trial of strength. Muhammad pressed Khan's hand so powerfully that blood came out of the wrestler's fingers. The wrestler fell down at his feet and begged to be forgiven. He usually spent his time in the mosque in teaching the holy Qur'an, leading the prayers five times a day and leading additional Nafl prayers by the riverside in the night. Haji Muhammad attempted to put the Sunnah in practice as precisely as possible. He said: > \\"My way of life is the Sharƒ´'ah of the Prophet. My way of the Tarƒ´qah is the > Sharƒ´'ah of the Prophet. The way of life of the Prophet implies also my way > of life. To walk through the Sharƒ´'ah is like walking on an illuminated > way.\\" By day Muhammad always wore a big woollen sheet, as prescribed by the Sunnah. This piece of cloth is named bhoora in the Punjabi language, hence he was also called Bhoorawala Pir. Today, followers of his order also wear the bhoora.  Literary works  There are many works of Sayyid NaushƒÅh Ganj Bakhsh. As time passes they are compiled and published from manuscripts. At present there are five books of poetry and prose: *KulliyƒÅt-i NaushƒÅh: (Urdu poetry) consisting of 76 Risala's and 2400 verses. *KulliyƒÅt-i NaushƒÅh: (Punjabi poetry) In this work 126 Risala's of about four thousand verses are alphabetically arranged. *Ma‚ÄòƒÅrif-i Tasawwuf: (Persian poetry) dealing with assignments on the spiritual path. *MawƒÅ'iz-i NaushƒÅh Pƒ´r: (Punjabi prose) comprises delivered speeches and advices. *Ganj-ul-AsrƒÅr (\\"the treasure of mysteries\\"): a short Risala in prose ascribed to him. According to Professor Ahmed Qureshi the following books are also written by Sayyid Naushah Pir: Diwan Urdu, Diwan Punjabi (two poems in respectively Urdu and Punjabi) and Mathnawi-ye Ganj (\\"The Mathnawi of Naushah Ganj Bakhsh\\"). Quotations \\"O friend, withdraw yourself from the world.\\" \\"If you don't, you have once to do that.\\" \\"Don't spoil your time of life.\\" \\"Leave the fame of the world behind you.\\" \\"O my true friend, follow your Murshid (guide).\\" \\"Do this in sincere surrendering in the heart with belief.\\" \\"Commemorate the Kalima, so that you will not lose it.\\" \\"The sufferings of this world and the last moment [death].\\" \\"You can only prevail by this!\\"  Death  Haji Muhammad died of natural causes on Monday, the fifteenth of the Islamic month Rabƒ´ 'ul-Awwal 1064 AH, aged one hundred and one. This date corresponds to Monday the eighteenth May 1654 A.D. He was buried in the village named Naushehra in Gujrat. His body was later interred at Ranmal Sharif in Gujrat. His grave is open to the public. The part of land on which his grave has been buried, belongs to the territory of Ranmal Sharif. The number of plot was formerly 220 and at the present 84/1. Due to flooding in 1757 his body was transferred from its original burial site. According to tradition, when his coffin surfaced, his body was entirely intact, even his shroud was unharmed. After being damaged again by the river Chenab his coffin was finally moved to the west of Sahanpal Sharif. In 1950 this new tomb was damaged by rain. Consequently, the supports subsided and cracks appeared in the tomb. His death anniversary ('Urs) is held at this place every year again. Urs starts on 2nd Thursday of Har (Bikrami Calendar), which falls in the last 10 days of June and usually lasts 3 days. Thursday and Friday for men and Saturday for women.  Successors A number of his sons and disciples carried his spiritual succession. In consequence, the QƒÅdirƒ´ NaushƒÅhƒ´ Order now includes many sub-branches carrying the name of his successors, such as BarkhurdƒÅrƒ´ Naushahƒ´, HƒÅshimƒ´ NaushƒÅhƒ´, SuchyƒÅrƒ´ NaushƒÅhƒ´ and Noushahi PAK REHMANI. For instance, the current head of the Naushahi Hashmi order is Shaykh Sayyid Mahroof Hussain Shah Naushahi Hashmi Qadiri, who founded the Sufi organisation Jamiyat Tabligh ul Islam in 1962 in the United Kingdom.

This condition mainly affects males, although females may have mild features of the syndrome. Signs and symptoms People with Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome often have distinctive facial features, such as widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a small nose, a long area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), and a widow's peak hairline. They frequently have mild to moderate short stature during childhood, but their growth usually catches up with that of their peers during puberty. Hand abnormalities are common in this syndrome and include short fingers (brachydactyly), curved pinky fingers (fifth finger clinodactyly), webbing of the skin between some fingers (cutaneous syndactyly), and a single crease across the palm. Other abnormalities in people with Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome include heart defects and a split in the upper lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Most males with Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome have a shawl scrotum, in which the scrotum surrounds the penis instead of hanging below. Less often, they have undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). The intellectual development of people with Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome varies widely. Some may have mild learning and behavior problems, while others have normal intelligence. In rare cases, severe intellectual disability has been reported.  Genetics  X-linked recessive inheritance. Mutations in the FGD1 gene are the only known genetic cause of Aarskog-Scott syndrome. The FGD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) another protein called Cdc42, which transmits signals that are important for various aspects of development before and after birth. Mutations in the FGD1 gene lead to the production of an abnormally functioning protein. These mutations disrupt Cdc42 signaling, leading to the wide variety of abnormalities that occur in people with Aarskog-Scott syndrome. Only about 20 percent of people with this disorder have identifiable mutations in the FGD1 gene. The cause of Aarskog-Scott syndrome in other affected individuals is unknown. Pathophysiology The Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome is due to mutation in the FGD1 gene. FGD1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates Cdc42, a member of the Rho (Ras homology) family of the p21 GTPases. By activating Cdc42, FGD1 protein stimulates fibroblasts to form filopodia, cytoskeletal elements involved in cellular signaling, adhesion, and migration. Through Cdc42, FGD1 protein also activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade, a pathway that regulates cell growth, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation. Within the developing mouse skeleton, FGD1 protein is expressed in precartilaginous mesenchymal condensations, the perichondrium and periosteum, proliferating chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. These results suggest that FGD1 signaling may play a role in the biology of several different skeletal cell types including mesenchymal prechondrocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The characterization of the spatiotemporal pattern of FGD1 expression in mouse embryos has provided important clues to the understanding of the pathogenesis of Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome. It appears likely that the primary defect in Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome is an abnormality of FGD1/Cdc42 signaling resulting in anomalous embryonic development and abnormal endochondral and intramembranous bone formation. Diagnosis Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the FGDY1 gene. Genetic counseling is indicated for individuals or families who may carry this condition, as there are overlapping features with fetal alcohol syndrome. Other examinations or tests can help with diagnosis. These can include: detailed family history * conducting a detailed physical examination to document morphological features * testing for genetic defect in FGDY1 * x-rays can identify skeletal abnormalities * echo cardiogram can screen for heart abnormalities * CT scan of the brain for cystic development * X-ray of the teeth * Ultrasound of abdomen to identify undescended testis Treatment Similar to all genetic diseases Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome cannot be cured, although numerous treatments exist to increase the quality of life. Surgery may be required to correct some of the anomalies, and orthodontic treatment may be used to correct some of the facial abnormalities. Trials of growth hormone have been effective to treat short stature in this disorder. Prognosis Some people may have some mental slowness, but children with this condition often have good social skills. Some males may have problems with fertility. History The syndrome is named for Dagfinn Aarskog, a Norwegian pediatrician and human geneticist who first described it in 1970, and for Charles I. Scott, Jr., an American medical geneticist who independently described the syndrome in 1971.

Biography Mariana Victoria was born at the Royal Palace of Queluz, near Lisbon. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Mariana Victoria of Spain, a daughter of Philip V of Spain. Her grandmother Mariana went to Spain in 1777 to discuss an alliance with her brother Charles III of Spain. While there, she helped to bring about the marriage of Mariana Victoria and the Spanish king's younger son, Infante Gabriel, her mother's first cousin. They married by proxy on 12 April 1785 at the Ducal Palace of Vila Vi√ßosa. The couple met for the first time at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez on 23 May and had another nuptial ceremony. The royal couple had three children, of whom two died young. At the birth of her last child, Infante Carlos, she and her husband were in residence at Gabriel's private residence, the Casita del Infante at El Escorial.

Early life and education Winifred Holt was born in New York on 17 November 1870, the daughter of Henry Holt and Mary Florence West Holt. Her father was a wealthy publisher, and her maternal grandfather was financier James Selby West. Her sister Edith married surgeon Joseph Colt Bloodgood. Holt was educated at the Brearley School in New York. She took lessons in sculpture, anatomy, and drawing during a visit to Florence in 1894. Career With her father's encouragement, Holt assisted at a settlement house the Bowery district of New York for several years, while also attending plays, concerts and opera performances. On another visit to Italy, in 1901, she and her sister Edith observed a group of blind students at a concert, engrossed by the music. In 1903 they started New York's Ticket Bureau for the Blind, and Winifred devoted the rest of her life to assisting blind people. She campaigned for New York's first census of blind residents. She worked for sight-saving measures for babies and schoolchildren, and against firecrackers: \\"She urges that patriotism may be taught the rising generation without such ruthless sacrifice as 600 children losing their sight on one day, in the celebration of our national independence,\\" reported a 1913 profile. The New York Association for the Blind was founded at the Holt's home in 1905. The organization is today known as Lighthouse International. In 1913 the first \\"Lighthouse\\" center opened in New York City, a six-story building modeled on a settlement house, and dedicated by President William Howard Taft. Lighthouse centers assisted blind people in education, vocational training, job placement, and recreation. She opened similar centers in many other cities in the United States, and then in other countries, including Italy, Japan, China, and Brazil. She attended international conferences on blindness in Edinburgh in 1908 and in London in 1914. In 1914 she was awarded a gold medal by the National Institute of Social Sciences, for her contributions to social welfare work. During and after World War I, Holt spent eighteen months in France, where she met with blinded veterans and worked towards rehabilitation and vocational opportunities for them.

It opened in stages, in 1861 and 1863. It was built on the broad gauge and had steep gradients, including a rope worked incline near Briton Ferry. Always short of money, it was worked by a coal company for some years and then by the Great Western Railway from 1908. It was absorbed by that company in 1923. A tunnel collapse in 1947 closed the western section of the network, but by then it was connected to an alternative route via Port Talbot. A local passenger service was operated between 1918 and 1930, continuing for the use of miners until 1964. The line closed completely in 1970. Beginnings System map of the South Wales Mineral RailwayTowards the end of the 18th century, collieries began to be developed in the Cymmer district were opened. Coal was carried to wharves on the Bristol Channel on the backs of pack animals, although a stone-block sleeper tramroad, the Glyncorrwg Mineral Railway, took coal from the Blaen Cregan colliery to the Neath Canal at Aberdulais. The Glyncorrwg Mineral Railway was abandoned in 1861; it had been in a series of financial difficulties. By this time the South Wales Railway had opened its line, in 1850; it was a broad gauge trunk railway connecting the area between Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot with the merging railway network of the associated Great Western Railway. (The companies amalgamated in 1863.) In the upper areas of the Afan Valley pits were being developed, and needed a means of transport to the forges further down the Afan Valley, and at Neath, as well as to docks on the Bristol Channel. The first successful proposal for a railway to connect with the mineral resources of the Afan Valley was the Briton Ferry Dock and Railway. It was necessary to bring the mineral output to waterborne transport, and a wharf at Briton Ferry was to be developed for the purpose. The Briton Ferry Dock obtained its authorising Act on 3 July 1851. SWMR authorised In fact the scheme was not progressed, and in the 1853 session of Parliament, a successor scheme, the South Wales Mineral Railway (SWMR) was authorised by Act of 15 August 1853.According to Awdry, and Barrie and Baughan, Simmonds and Morgan. Smith says 10 August 1853. Viscount Villiers was a majority owner of the existing dock at Briton Ferry and he was a leading promoter of the SWMR. It was to be on the broad gauge, linking with the newly opened South Wales Railway, and the engineer was Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Capital authorised was ¬£120,000.Clive Smith, Bygone Railways of the Afan, Alun Books, Port Talbot, 1982, , pages 17 to 21D S M Barrie, revised Peter Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1994, , pages 190 to 192Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens, 1990, , page 45H Morgan, South Wales Branch Lines, by Ian Allan Ltd, Shepperton, 1984, , pages 108 to 110Robin G Simmonds, A History of the Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company and the South Wales Mineral Railway Company: volume 1: 1853 - 1907, Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2012, , pages 145 to 149 The new company had difficulty in raising subscriptions for shares, and this significantly delayed the start of construction. At a general meeting on 16 September 1854 it was announced that the company had failed to induce owners of property along the line to take the remaining shares. A proposal had been received from the Glyncorrwg Coal Company to take up the unallotted capital, provided it was granted a lease at a rental which would ensure a dividend of 5 per cent. This was approved, and the South Wales Mineral Railway (Lease) Act of 25 May 1855 ratified a lease for up to ninety-nine years to ten gentlemen trading under the name of the Glyncorrwg Coal Company. The lease was finalised on 4 January 1856. Construction and first opening After several changes of prospective contractor, work on construction was begun in October 1857. A series of reports of imminent opening were given to the shareholders, until finally it opened prior to a shareholders' meeting in September 1861.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II, 1863-1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931, pages 443 and 444 The line turned north- west across the South Wales Railway main line, crossing over it by a bridge. There was a backshunt to reach the actual dock operated by the Briton Ferry Floating Dock Company. There was a mile double-track inclined plane, known as Ynys y Maerdy, to descend to that area from the hills; the remainder of the line was single track. Construction was completed in stages from the Briton Ferry end. It reached Argoed, short of the tunnel on 1 September 1861. Coincidentally Briton Ferry Dock opened on 22 August 1861, and this prompted the directors of the SWMR to seek an Act to connect its railway to the new dock from a point near the original line's junction with the SWR. Some requested provisions were refused but the Act received the Royal Assent on 1 August 1861.Simmonds, pages 153 and 154 The original line was open throughout on 10 March 1863. It was miles long. The line had a tunnel 1,109 yards in length at Gyfylchi, near Tonmawr. Gradients were as steep as 1 in 22 quite apart from the incline. Access to Briton Ferry Dock was available from June 1863. On 29 July 1864 the SWMR obtained Parliamentary authorisation for some extensions at the upper end of the line. Financial problems and gauge conversion In 1869 the Glyncorrwg Coal Company was wound up for non-payment of rents. As it was the lessor of the SWMR this posed a significant threat, but the Glyncorrwg Colliery Co Ltd was quickly formed to take over the activities of the defunct company. It was induced also to take over the working of the SWMR and an agreement to do so was signed on 23 March 1870.Simmonds, pages 156 to 158 In February 1871 the GWR decided to convert its South Wales Railway lines to narrow (standard) gauge. In an 1872 Act the GWR included powers to make arrangements with six South Wales railway companies affected by the change of gauge. The Bill contained a clause authorising the GWR to make arrangements with the affected smaller companies, although without actually referring to compensation. The SWMR petitioned against the Bill, but the result was that when the Bill was passed, there was no mention of the SWMR. The SWMR had to bear the cost itself, as did the Glyncorrwg Colliery Co (for its own lines). The line was closed from 1 May to 4 June 1872 for the gauge conversion. The directors at first decided to sell the four broad gauge engines leased to the Glyncorrwg Colliery Co., but in the event one was retained and converted to narrow gauge. The Glyncorrwg Colliery Co spent ¬£14,599 on the new locomotives and converting the SWMR; SWMR capital expenditure on gauge conversion amounted to ¬£4,585. By November 1873 considerable financial liabilities had accrued, amounting to ¬£35,000. An SWMR Act of 1874 was given the Royal Assent on 16 July 1874 authorising ¬£22,210 of new preference shares for the conversion of the arrears of dividends and to issue ¬£35,000 of debentures. The September 1876 general meeting was informed that three collieries on the line had closed due to the state of the coal trade in South Wales, and by the following March only two collieries were working, Glyncorrwg and Corrwg Fechan. The Glyncorrwg Colliery Co was not now in a financial position to continue the working agreement it went into liquidation. Robert Smith, manager of the Glyncorrwg Colliery Co, was appointed liquidator and continued to work the colliery and the railway. It was reported at the general meeting held in September 1877 that the quantity of coal carried was so small it would not cover the working expenses. On 23 August 1877, Mr T J Woods, the secretary, informed the directors that he had been appointed receiver of the SWMR. A new Glyncorrwg Colliery Co Ltd was registered on 13 March 1880 with the same objects as the 1869 company, but this time with a capital of ¬£78,000. Port Talbot Railway In 1898, on 14 November, the Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company opened its line from Tonmawr, connecting with the SWMR, to a dock at Port Talbot. By this time the 30-year lease by the Glyncorrwg Coal Company had expired and the PTD&R; took over the working of the line, and adopted the Blaenavon and Whitworth branches. Control by the GWR The SWMR was being worked by the Glyncorrwg Colliery Co and effectively funded by it as working costs increased and income remained at best static. This could not go on indefinitely, as the Glyncorrwg company itself was not greatly profitable. On 8 October 1908 the SWMR, the PTR&D; and the Glyncorrwg company agreed a working arrangement, which included the Great Western Railway which was now working the PTR&D.; The GWR would fund the liquidation of the SWMR historic debt and from 1 January 1908 was considered to have had running powers.These dates and the manner of the change are described slightly differently in Morgan.Simmonds, page 170 As the network of the SWMR and the PTR&D; was now under unified control, the GWR increasingly used the PTR&D; route to bring mineral traffic down from Tonmawr. This avoided the use of the incline at Briton Ferry, which limited loads of trains. The cable worked incline was closed on 1 June 1910. Instead coal was then transported from Glyncorrwg to Port Talbot via the Gyfylchi Tunnel to Tonmawr. Passengers Passengers had been carried on the line from about 1865, but almost certainly not in passenger carriages and not with Board of Trade sanction. Simmonds says that it was \\"condoned\\" in the 1880 working agreement, and that in the week ending 31 December 1886, 1,053 passengers had been conveyed between Cymmer and Ynysmaerdy Incline Top, from where it was a two- mile walk to Neath.Simmonds, pages 164 and 165 The mines at Glyncorrwg were difficult to man because there was inadequate housing there, and most of the colliers lived in Cymmer. There had been several requests to run a miners' service but sanction had repeatedly been refused by the Board of Trade. In December 1916 the Blaencorrwg Colliery co asked the Boardof Trade to authorise such a service, and now that the war effort demanded the production of coal, a different view was taken in January 1917. The service started on 5 March 1917, running from Cymmer to Glyncorrwg, Blaencorrwg and North Rhonda Halt. The trains were propelled up the rising gradient, and they were operated by the Port Talbot company Glyncorwg South Pit reopened in 1919 and in November 1920 South Pit Halt was added to the station list.Robin G Simmonds, A History of the Port Talbot Railway & Docks Company and the South Wales Mineral Railway Company: volume 2: 1894 - 1971, Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2013, , pages 365 and 367 There were four services in each direction, five on Saturdays. The passenger service was discontinued on 22 September 1930. After the closure to public services, workmen's trains continued until 1958, after which the colliers service only ran between Glyncorrwg and North Rhondda Halt. In 1963 the service was further shortened back to South Pit Halt, and finally closed completely after 30 October 1964. Grouping and after On 1 January 1923, the South Wales Mineral Railway company was subject to the process called the \\"grouping\\". The Railways Act 1921 had mandated that four new large railway companies, the \\"groups\\" would be created, and nearly all the existing railways of Great Britain would be merged into one or other of them. There was to be a new Great Western Railway; the old one was naturally the largest constituent. The South Wales Mineral Railway had been worked by the Great Western Railway since 1908, so that the company itself was merely a financial entity. Its issued capital was stated to be ¬£250,000, and its income for the year 1921 was ¬£2,744, no doubt simply a lease charge. Its route length was declared to be 13 miles, and five locomotives were handed over to the new Great Western Railway.Peter Semmens, History of the Great Western Railway: 1: Consolidation, 1923 ‚Äì 1929, George Allen and Unwin, London, 1985, Studio Editions reprint 1990, , page 37 The terms were ¬£10 cash for ¬£100 SWMR ordinary stock, and ¬£25 cash for ¬£100 SWMR preference stock.Simmonds, volume 2, page 386 On 13 July 1947, there was a partial collapse of the Gyfylchi tunnel, and the section of line from there to Abercregan sidings near Cymmer district was closed. All goods and mineral traffic from Glyncorrwg was then taken to Port Talbot over the former Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway line, reached by a double reversal at Cymmer. The stub branch was subsequently known as the North Rhondda branch. Mineral traffic continued on the section between Abercregan Sidings and Cymmer Junction until August 1970, when the entire former SWMR network ceased to operate. Locomotives =Broad gauge= The Glyncorrwg Coal Company provided four or five different locomotives to work the South Wales Mineral Railway. One or two were withdrawn after a couple of years and little is known about them. Princess was a small 0-4-0ST tank engine built by Manning Wardle and Company in 1863 (works no. 74). It was converted to standard gauge as an 0-6-0ST. Glyncorrwg and another, which name is unknown, were a pair of Manning, Wardle 0-4-2ST locomotives. Glyncorrwg was built in 1864 (works no. 116). In 1872 it was sold to Roland Brotherhood, an engineer at Chippenham, who then sold it on to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It lost its name and became No. 110, changing to 2058 when it became the property of the Great Western Railway in 1876. It was finally withdrawn in 1881. The second 0-4-2ST was built in 1866 (works no. 136) but in 1869 went to work on the Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway where it was named Newquay. In 1874 the line passed to the Cornwall Minerals Railway, being withdrawn by them in 1877. =Standard gauge= In 1902 there were five standard gauge locomotives, all 0-6-0 saddle tanks. Nos. 1 to 4 were built at the GWR's Wolverhampton railway works in 1872/1873 and these may have been standard GWR 645 Class locomotives. No. 5 was built by Black, Hawthorn & Co in 1891 (works no. 1028).K P Plant, The South Wales Mineral Railway, at the Industrial Railway Record http://www.irsociety.co.uk/Archives/25/south_wales_mineral_railway.htm Topography =Location list= * Briton Ferry; * Ynysymaerdy Incline; * Tonmawr Junction; * Gyfylchi Tunnel; * Cymmer; opened 28 March 1918; Cymmer Corrwg from 1926; closed 22 September 1930; miners' use before and after public opening, about 1880 to 2 November 1964; * Nantewlaeth Colliery Halt; unadvertised miners' halt; in use at least 1945 to 1954; * Glyncorrwg; by 1865; open to public 28 March 1918; closed 22 September 1930; miners use before and after public opening, about 1880 to 2 November 1964; * South Pit Halt; not advertised miners' halt; open after 1928; closed 2 November 1964; at first Glyncorrwg South Pits, later South Pits; * North Rhondda Halt; miners; sometimes known as Blaencorrwg Halt; opened 27 August 1923; closed March 1963; * Glyncorrwg Colliery.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002R A Cooke, Atlas of the Great Western Railway, 1947, Wild Swan Publications Limited, Didcot, 1997 Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, Notes References External links * South Wales Mineral Railway Category:Early Welsh railway companies Category:Great Western Railway constituents Category:7 ft gauge railways Category:Railway companies established in 1853 Category:Railway lines opened in 1863 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1908 Category:Broad gauge (7 feet) railway locomotives Category:Closed railway lines in Wales Category:Standard gauge railways in Wales ","title":"South Wales Mineral Railway"},{"id":"7966569","text":"Aegilops bicornis (syn.

In fact, it was unable to raise the necessary capital and was loss- making from the time of opening the first short section of its line in 1860, and it was in receivership for much of its life. It eventually reached Llandyssil in 1864, but was not extended further during its independent existence. Its station at Carmarthen became the focus of several independent cross-country railways which made junctions with it, and for a time the toll charges for the short distances used by their trains was useful income, but the line never became solvent and it sold its concern to the Great Western Railway in 1882. The GWR eventually extended from Llandyssil to Newcastle Emlyn, which improved the use of the line somewhat. Meanwhile, another railway was built to Cardigan from Whitland, and the C&CR; line did not extend beyond Newcastle Emlyn. Passenger trains ceased operating on the Newcastle Emlyn branch in 1952 and on the rest of the line in 1965 apart from access to the creamery north of Pencader until 1973. The exception is the short stub into Carmarthen town that diverges from the through-line from Swansea and is used by all passenger trains serving Carmarthen. South Wales Railway System map of the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway The Great Western Railway opened its line between London and Bristol in 1841. A branch to Gloucester and Cheltenham was built by the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway. The GWR encouraged the formation of what was to become the South Wales Railway to build a line from near Gloucester through Cardiff and Swansea to Fishguard. The South Wales Railway obtained the Royal Assent on 4 August 1845. The line opened progressively: from Swansea (Landore) to Carmarthen on 11 October 1852 and to Haverfordwest and Neyland on 2 January 1854. Radically changed economic conditions put reaching Fishguard in abeyance.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: vol I: 1833 - 1863: part II, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927 The position of the town of Carmarthen on the River Towy and the hills to the west of the town made the design of a through railway difficult, and the decision was taken to pass south of Carmarthen. The SWR built a station adjacent to the Pensarn to Cwmffryd road (now A484). In common with the Great Western Railway, the South Wales Railway was a broad gauge line. The South Wales Railway later merged with the Great Western Railway and became for all practical purposes part of the Great Western on 1 January 1862.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I part 1: 1833 - 1863, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 434 Bold ideas Connection to a railway hugely improved the economic prosperity of a town, enabling goods to be brought in and out cheaply. The terrain north and west of Carmarthen was in need of a railway connection and the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway was planned. The first promoters of the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway planned to build a line from Carmarthen to Cardigan, and build a new deep-water port there, opening up shipping routes from west Wales. In 1853 this scheme was widened to include a line to Kidwelly and Cross Hands, connecting the mining and quarrying on Mynydd Mawr. Late in that year, it became plain that these ambitions were beyond the expected financial resources of the company, and a more modest scheme, to build from Carmarthen to Newcastle Emlyn, was formulated.M R C Price, The Gwendraeth Valleys Railway: Kidwelly to Mynydd-y-Garreg, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1997, Authorisation Accordingly, a Bill for the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway went to Parliament, but proposing a line only as far as Newcastle Emlyn, a distance of 26 miles, at this stage. The Bill obtained the Royal Assent on 1 July 1854, with share capital of ¬£300,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The company was to build its own \\"Carmarthen\\" station closer to the town than the SWR station, and a bridge was needed to cross the River Towy. The line was to be to the broad gauge, consistent with the gauge of the South Wales Railway.D S M Barrie, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1994, E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931Brief History of the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway at the Disused Stations website, http://www.disused- stations.org.uk/n/newcastle_emlyn/Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway at John Speller's Web Pages http://spellerweb.net/rhindex/UKRH/GreatWestern/Broadgauge/Cardigan.htmlTom Ferris, Lost Lines of Wales: Aberystwyth to Carmarthen, Graffeg Press, 2016, The Act permitted the raising of capital, but actually securing commitment to investing proved difficult; an extension of time was authorised during 1856 but it was not until March 1857 that enough money had been raised to start work. The engineer was Joseph Cubitt. In 1859, the Company considered altering its track gauge from broad gauge to standard gauge (at the time referred to as narrow-gauge), to reduce costs. This was opposed by the South Wales Railway, which feared that it would encourage a connection with a rival with standard gauge lines. A Bill authorising this was passed in the House of Commons but the C&CR; withdrew the proposal on receiving certain working undertakings from the SWR, and continued construction in the authorised broad gauge. First openings The short distance from the junction with the SWR (Myrtle Hill Junction) to the C&CR; Carmarthen station was opened on 1 March 1860; the South Wales Railway station was renamed Carmarthen Junction on the same day.Stations at Carmarthen, in Railway Magazine, April 1961, page 294 It had been intended to open on 1 November 1859 but the mode of the junction was objected to by the SWR engineer. This was followed by opening of the line as far as Conwil on 3 September 1860; there was an intermediate station at Bronwydd Arms. The C&CR; relied on the SWR to work its line, and friction developed when the C&CR; claimed that the charges for this were excessive. Whatever the truth of that, the C&CR; was not earning enough to pay the working expenses and the service was suspended after only four months' operation, on 31 December 1860. There were outstanding debts to the SWR which the C&CR; was unable to pay, and the SWR seized ¬£1,343 worth of rails and sold them. The C&CR; now determined to work the line itself, and hired two 4-4-0 tank engines; it reopened its line on 12 August 1861.The Disused Stations history gives 15 August 1861. Construction further northwards was difficult; Pencader tunnel was especially troublesome. Work had started in the Spring of 1857, but in the Autumn of 1861 the contractor abandoned the workings, and a substitute contractor had to be found. The Company obtained Parliamentary authorisation for a revival of the powers to build to Newcastle Emlyn on 29 July 1862 and for an extension to Cardigan, by Act of 1 July 1863. The Company was hopelessly insolvent and never managed to construct either of these sections in its own right. The line was opened as far as Pencader on 12 October 1863, but difficulty with the passenger authorisation was hinted at: > Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway: A further portion of this Company's line > was opened for mineral traffic to Pencader on the 12th instant [12 October > 1864], and obtaining the permission of the Board of Trade the Directors will > open the line for passenger traffic up to that point. Considerable progress > has been made with the works on the section between Pencader and Llandissil > [sic], and it appears that every effort is being made by Mr. Holden, the > contractor, to complete the line for traffic up to the latter place as soon > as possible.Birmingham Daily Post: 29 October 1863, accessed at the British > Newspaper Archive, subscription required Evidently \\"obtaining the permission of the Board of Trade\\" proved difficult, and the line from Conwil to Pencader was opened to passenger traffic on 28 March 1864, with an intermediate station at Llanpumpsaint. MacDermot says that this opening \\"was made in defiance of the Board of Trade, who ordered a postponement, but do not appear to have taken any effective steps to enforce their order\\".It seems not to be possible to confirm MacDermot's remarkable assertion.MacDermot, volume II, page 344 The line was opened onwards to Llandyssil on 3 June 1864. There were four trains each way daily, generally to and from the South Wales Railway station at Carmarthen Junction. Ambitious plans but financial difficulties Undeterred by its financial situation the Company now obtained an Act to build from Kidwelly to Velindre in 1864 and from Kidwelly to Pontyberem in 1865, accessed in the Gwendraeth Fach and Gwendraeth Fawr valleys respectively. There were considerable mineral deposits at these locations, chiefly limestone in the former case. The finances of the C&CR; were so confused that it was found impossible to proceed, and a Shareholders' Meeting was held on 11 July 1866 to agree to the separation of the scheme from the C&CR.; A Bill was prepared: > for authorizing the construction of the Carmarthen and Cardigan (Kidwelly > branch) as a separate undertaking, and for that purpose to raise 100,000l > [¬£100,000] of capital... It also appears that 70,000l was [already] > authorized to be raised by the Carmarthen and Cardiganshire [sic] Company's > Kidwelly Branch Act of 1865, but the affairs of the Carmarthen and Cardigan > Railway being so involved, it was found impossible to construct the Kidwelly > branch unless entirely separated from the general undertaking.The Times > Newspaper, 11 July 1866 Financial mismanagement was clearly to blame: > Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway: A few days ago reference was made to the > financial position of this company.

The shareholders agreed with the separation of the Gwendraeth branches, and a separate company, the Gwendraeth Valleys Railway, was incorporated on 20 June 1866, to build the line to Mynydd-y-Garreg in the Gwendraeth Fach, and the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway was formed from an amalgamation of the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway and the Burry Port company, also adopting the powers for the Gwendraeth Fawr line on 30 April 1866.Raymond E Bowen, Burry Port and Gwendreath Valley Railway and its Antecedent Canals: volume 1: the Canals, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2001, R W Miller, The Burry Port & Gwendreath Valley Railway and its Antecedent Canals: Volume Two: The Railway and Dock, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2009, Declining to take on new liabilities was all very well, but it did not improve the trading losses and existing indebtedness. Interest payments on bank loans of three-quarters of a million pounds could not be sustained, and the company went into receivership in November 1864, continuing to trade under administration. Llanelly Railway and Dock Company The Llanelly Railway and Dock Company had built a line from Llanelly towards the Amman Valley and later extended it to Llandeilo. In 1864 it opened a line from Llandeilo to Carmarthen, actually making a junction with the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway at Abergwili Junction, about a mile north of Carmarthen. The Llanelly line was narrow gauge (later referred to as standard gauge) and by arrangement laid additional rails from Abergwili Junction to Carmarthen C&CR; station to enable their trains to run. Llanelly goods trains started running on this section on 13 November 1864 and passenger trains from 1 June 1865. Through a series of political machinations, the Carmarthen section of the Llanelly Railway and Dock company eventually became part of the London and North Western Railway in 1891.Michael Denman, Railways Around Llanelli: A History of the Railways of East Carmarthenshire, Published by The Wider View, Huntingdon, 2000, Gwyn Brynant Jones and Denis Dunstone, The Origins of the LMS in South Wales, Gomer Publishers, Llandysul, 1999, Manchester and Milford Railway Conwil railway station (1962) In 1860 the Manchester and Milford Railway received the Royal Assent to build a line from Pencader to Llanidloes, and the following year a branch to Aberystwyth was proposed; these lines were to join the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway at Pencader. However the Manchester and Milford Railway was a narrow (standard) gauge line, so through-running at Pencader would not be possible. In fact, the M&MR; was riven by indecision and lack of money, and it had to seek an amending Act for a time extension, which it achieved in 1865. By then Parliament considered the broad gauge to be a \\"general irritant\\"J S Holden, The Manchester & Milford Railway, Oakwood Press, Blandford, 1979, and the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway was to be obliged to lay a third rail (to enable narrow gauge trains to run) between Pencader Junction and Carmarthen, and to grant running powers to the M&MR.; Failing compliance the M&MR; would be entitled to lay the additional rails itself. Seeing this as an unfriendly incursion, the C&CR; applied for running powers over the M&MR; to Aberystwyth, but this was turned down by Parliament. The M&MR; line from Pencader to Lampeter was opened on 1 January 1866 but the mixed gauge rails had not been laid; accordingly, Davies and Beeston, the M&MR;'s contractor, were instructed to lay the necessary rails; they received ¬£20,000 of M&MR; shares for their trouble. While the work was proceeding there was an exchange station called Pencader Junction, a short distance north of Pencader C&CR; station. The M&MR; opened its line from Lampeter to Strata Florida on 1 September 1866, and on to Aberystwyth on 12 August 1867. The mixed gauge track between Pencader Junction and Carmarthen was \\"ready\\" in August 1866 and M&MR; goods trains started running through from 1 November 1866. Passenger train operation was delayed because of the difficulty in obtaining Board of Trade approval for passenger operation, which was not received until February 1868.Some sources state that passenger trains of the M&MR; started running through on 1 November 1867 but Holden is adamant that this is erroneous. In the meantime, southbound mixed (goods and passenger) M&MR; trains detached their passenger coaches at Pencader and re-attached them on the northbound journey., In any case, the M&MR; passenger trains ceased running south of Pencader in 1872. Pembroke and Tenby Railway The line between Pembroke and Tenby had opened in 1863, and in 1866, extended to Whitland on the South Wales Railway main line. The P&TR; was a narrow (standard) gauge railway. The Company had ambitious intentions of linking with the Manchester and Milford Railway, thus forming a through railway from the manufacturing districts of Lancashire to its own harbour at Pembroke Dock. This would require a narrow gauge connection between Whitland and Carmarthen. The GWR main line was still broad gauge at this time and the GWR did not welcome the competition; after a strained period of negotiation, the GWR converted one track of its line between Whitland and Carmarthen to accommodate the P&TR; trains. The P&TR; built a west-to-north curve at Carmarthen, known as the P&T; Loop, enabling direct running into the C&CR; station. Goods traffic on the route started in June 1868, and passenger traffic started in August 1869. This arrangement was not the great advance the P&TR; had hoped for, as the through traffic from the M&MR;, itself in poor financial health, was not great, although the Llanelly Dock and Railway contributed more, having a better northward connection via Llandeilo. The C&CR; demanded a toll payment equivalent to four miles running for the P&TR; trains which only used 48 chains of C&CR; track, adding to the difficulties faced by the P&TR.;M R C Price, The Pembroke and Tenby Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1986, Out of receivership The C&CR; was released from receivership in 1867, aided by the income from toll charges received from the vesting railways. Gauge conversion The GWR converted the gauge of the South Wales Railway line to standard gauge on 12 May 1872. The C&CR; was obliged to convert its remaining broad gauge section, the three miles from Pencader to Llandyssil, as well. This was completed on 1 June 1872 at which time broad-gauge operation elsewhere in Wales had already ceased: the C&CR; ran the last broad gauge trains in Wales. Sale to the Great Western Railway In September 1869 a new company was formed, encouraged by the C&CR;, to extend the line to Newcastle Emlyn and later to continue to Cardigan, but once again inadequate finance was forthcoming. In desperation the C&CR; made an approach to the London and North Western Railway, inviting them to acquire the C&CR; and build the extension to Newcastle Emlyn, but the LNWR saw this as a remote and unprofitable outpost and declined. In 1881 the C&CR; line was leased to the GWR, and on 1 July 1882 the C&CR; was absorbed by the GWR. An alternative route to Cardigan The Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway had long given up any hope of reaching Cardigan, and after acquisition by the Great Western Railway the GWR too was unwilling to complete the connection. In 1869 the Whitland and Taf Vale Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation to build a branch line from Whitland to quarries around Glogue; it opened as far as Glogue in 1873, but soon saw the advantage in extending to Cardigan. Changing its name to The Whitland and Cardigan Railway it completed the line in 1886, at which time the GWR worked the trains. The GWR absorbed it in 1890, so that Cardigan was reached by GWR branch line from Whitland instead of from Carmarthen.M R C Price, The Whitland and Cardigan Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1976, Brief History of the Whitland & Cardigan Railway on Disused Stations Website at http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/cardigan/index.shtml Under the Great Western Railway With a GWR branch line to Cardigan built, there was now no point in considering extending the C&CR; route that far; the GWR committed itself to build the extension of the former C&CR; line on to Newcastle Emlyn, but even this was a low priority for the company, and it was not until 1 July 1895 that the extension line was opened. The GWR established an omnibus service from Newcastle Emlyn to Cardigan. The Manchester and Milford Railway was leased by the Great Western Railway in 1906 and absorbed by it in 1911. The Carmarthen to Aberystwyth line then became the main line, and the Newcastle Emlyn line operated as its branch. Carmarthen stations The GWR main line trains called at Carmarthen Junction station and connections were available there to the former C&CR; station. In 1895 there were 14 GWR trains each way between the Junction and the Town station.The C&CR; station is often referred to as the \\"Town\\" station for convenience, but it was always officially known simply as \\"Carmarthen\\".Bradshaw's Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland, December 1895, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, The C&CR; station was closer to the town but was neither well constructed nor convenient, and the GWR took the opportunity to build a better station a short distance to the south, opening it on 1 July 1902. The old P&TR; loop had been reduced to sidings status when P&TR; trains stopped running through to Carmarthen, and it was now reopened as a running line. Through GWR trains on the main line now made a station call at the improved Town station, reversing there to continue their journey. The Junction station closed on 30 September 1926.According to Barrie; Quick gives 27 September 1926; the authoritative anonymous writer in the Railway Magazine of 1961 gives 27 September 1928. The Town station was greatly extended and enhanced in 1930 - 1931, and the River Towy bridge, dating from 1858 was reconstructed. The new bridge was constructed alongside the old bridge, and consequently, considerable permanent way alterations at each end were necessary. The opportunity was taken to remodel and improve the facilities at Carmarthen station; increased passenger and milk platform accommodation was provided, as well as extensive carriage cleaning facilities and resignalling. The station was \\"rapidly developing as the largest railway centre in West Wales\\".R Tourret, GWR Engineering Work, 1928 - 1938, Tourret Publishing, Abingdon, 2003, Closure Although the Newcastle Emlyn branch (as it had become) was busy and popular in the 1930s, the thinly scattered population of the area served by the station and the low level of economic activity made the railway loss-making after World War II. Nationalisation of the railways took place in 1948 and the GWR lines were part of the Western Region of British Railways. Closure of the Pencader to Newcastle Emlyn passenger service to stem financial losses was considered, and the branch closed to passengers after the last train on 13 September 1952. A limited goods service continued, but it too was discontinued on 28 September 1973. The Carmarthen to Pencader section of the C&CR; was now part of the main line to Aberystwyth. Although designated a main line, it was a long and difficult route connecting Carmarthen and Aberystwyth with relatively limited intermediate population centres. In the 1950s holiday trains to the Butlin's Holiday Camp at Pwllheli traversed the route,For example, the Summer 1960 public timetable for the Western Region of British Railways shows this train running on high summer Saturdays only at 10.10 am from Swansea to Pwllheli, calling (on the C&CR;) at Carmarthen and Pencader; it reversed at Aberystwyth and again at Dovey Junction and arrived at Penychain (for the holiday camp) at 4.56 pm and Pwllheli at 5.5 pm. The southbound train ran from Penychain (10.18 am) to Carmarthen (3.55 pm) only, following the same route. but in the economic conditions prevailing in the 1960s, it too came under review. The line closed to passengers on 22 February 1965.Peter Dale, Pembroke, Cardigan and Montgomery's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2007, The main line continued to serve a creamery at Pont Llanio near Llanddewi Brefi, which survived until 1970; milk trains also used the Aberayron branch as far as a creamery at Green Grove near Felin Fach, which remained in service until 1973.James Page, Forgotten Railways: South Wales, David & Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1979, The South Wales Railway station at Carmarthen Junction having long since closed, the 1931 \\"Town\\" station located on the C&CR; line is the only Carmarthen station, and it remains in use at the present day: all passenger trains (except certain Fishguard boat trains that omit a Carmarthen stop) use it. The short section from Myrtle Hill Junction to the station is the only section of the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway network still in use.

After the line was converted to standard gauge in 1872, they were sold to the South Devon Railway and Cornwall Railway respectively, although the locomotives for both these railways were worked as a common pool. They were both rebuilt with saddle tanks. In 1876, they became the property of the Great Western Railway and carried the numbers 2134 and 2135. Magpie was withdrawn in 1889 but Heron lasted until the gauge conversion. It worked the last broad gauge train from Tavistock to Plymouth Millbay railway station on 20 May 1892 before pulling the empty carriages to Swindon railway works for dismantling. The locomotives were named after birds.

Etna was sold to the South Devon Railway in 1868, and Hecla followed when the gauge was converted in 1872. They received the numbers 2132 and 2133; at some time Etna received a new saddle tank and its name was lost. They both survived until the end of the broad gauge in 1892. The locomotives were named after volcanoes. See Mount Etna and Hekla.

Nepenthes surigaoensis was formally described by Elmer in the March 27, 1915 issue of Leaflets of Philippine Botany.Nepenthes surigaoensis Elmer. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). Elmer made the following comments about the species in its type description: > Found among the moss laden cold and windy forested ridge at altitude along > the newly cut trail from lake Danao to the summit of mount Urdaneta or Masay > as the natives call it.

This was supported by Stewart McPherson in his 2009 monograph, Pitcher Plants of the Old World, which included an extensive morphological description of the species. Nepenthes surigaoensis has in the past been mistaken for a hybrid. In Yasuhiro Fukatsu's \\"The List of Nepenthes species and Hybrids\\", published in 1999, N. surigaoensis was said to represent a cross between N. alata and possibly N. merrilliana (a hybrid that has been called N. √ó merrilliata). Description An aerial offshoot from an old climbing stem with lower pitchers borne on long tendrils, found on Mount Masay Nepenthes surigaoensis is a climbing plant growing to a height of 5 m. The stem, which may be branched, is up to 1.25 cm in diameter and has internodes up to 14 cm long. It often scrambles through vegetation, sometimes leaning against slanted tree trunks, but may also grow prostrate along the ground. No infraspecific taxa of N. surigaoensis have been described. =Leaves= Leaves are coriaceous and petiolate. The lamina (leaf blade) varies in shape from linear to slightly lanceolate. It reaches up to 40 cm in length by 5 cm in width. It has an acute or obtuse apex and a slightly attenuate base that narrows to form a winged petiole. This petiole is strongly decurrent down the stem. In some specimens the laminar margins may meet the midrib at different points along its length, resulting in asymmetrical apices located up to 4 mm apart; this is also common in N. merrilliana. Another trait shared by these two species is the occasional difference in size between the laminar halves, with one being clearly wider than the other. The tendrils of N. surigaoensis are among the longest in the genus, reaching up to 120 cm. A typical lower pitcher from Mount Masay =Pitchers= Rosette and lower pitchers are typically wholly cylindrical or ellipsoidal, but may be slightly swollen in the basal portion. They can reach 24 cm in height by 9 cm in width, although they are more commonly up to 16 high by 7.5 cm wide. A pair of fringed wings up to 20 mm wide runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup, with filaments up to 16 mm long. The peristome is more-or-less cylindrical and up to 2.5 cm wide, becoming broader towards the sides and rear. It bears ribs up to 1.5 mm high and spaced up to 2 mm apart, which terminate in very narrow teeth up to 2.5 mm long. The peristome is elongated into a very short neck at the rear, where the two peristome lobes are typically separated by a gap of several millimetres. Its outer margin is recurved and may be slightly undulate. The pitcher lid or operculum varies in shape from elliptic to ovate and measures up to 8 cm in length by 6 cm in width. It does not bear any appendages on its lower surface. An unbranched spur measuring up to 22 mm in length is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers are broadly infundibular in the basal third to half of the pitcher cup and cylindrical to slightly swollen in the upper portion. They are smaller than lower pitchers, reaching 15 cm in height by 6.5 cm in width. Aerial pitchers are noted for retaining highly developed wings, which may be up to 15 mm wide with fringe elements up to 13 mm long. The peristome is rarely crenellated in upper pitchers. Otherwise, aerial traps are morphologically similar to their terrestrial counterparts. =Inflorescence= Nepenthes surigaoensis has a racemose inflorescence. It measures up to 40 cm in length and has a maximum basal diameter of 6 cm, flowers included. The peduncle itself is up to 18 cm long, whereas the rachis reaches up to 25 cm. Most flowers are borne in pairs on partial peduncles measuring up to 8 mm in length, with pedicels up to 16 mm long. The first flowers bear narrow bracts. Tepals are oblong and up to 5 mm long. They are noted for occasionally being of unequal width. The androphore is up to 6 mm long by 1 mm wide. =Indumentum and colouration= The majority of mature plants on Mount Masay bear an indumentum of coarse orange to brown hairs (‚â§1.8 mm long) on the pitchers and tendrils. Most of the remainder of the vegetative parts are more- or-less glabrous. Further field work is needed to determine whether this indumentum is typical of the species as a whole. The stem and tendrils are yellow to green, as is the midrib, although the latter may also be a very light orange (particularly the basal portion near the stem). The lamina is always green, even in young leaves; this feature separates N. surigaoensis from N. merrilliana. Rosette and lower pitchers are generally green, yellow, or light orange, but can turn wholly red with age. The inner surface of the pitcher is yellow to orange, often blotched with purple or black. The lid and peristome colours often match the rest of the pitcher exterior, although the latter can be as dark as purple in older traps. Upper pitchers are typically of a lighter pigmentation, being predominantly yellowish-green, occasionally with traces of red or purple speckles on the inner surface. Ecology Nepenthes surigaoensis is endemic to the Philippine island of Mindanao. It is presently known from only two locations: the Mount Masay massif of the Mabaho Range in northern Mindanao and a \\"minor peak\\" of the Pantaron Range in central Mindanao. Gronemeyer, T. 2009. Hochland Nepenthes auf Mindanao. Das Taublatt 63: 18. Further populations of this species may be present in the Diuata Mountains and other adjacent highland areas. Recent field observations place the altitudinal distribution of N. surigaoensis at 800‚Äì1200 m above sea level, although Elmer's original description gives an elevation of approximately 1750 m (\\"5750 feet\\" in the original). Nepenthes surigaoensis grows terrestrially on mountain ridges. It appears to be restricted to lower montane forest, where it is found in shady conditions among dense vegetation up to 8 m high. Stewart McPherson has suggested that the exceptionally long tendrils of this species are an adaptation to its dense habitat. They allow the lower pitchers to rest on the ground even when produced on higher parts of the stem, thus maximising their chances of catching insect prey. No natural hybrids involving N. surigaoensis have been recorded. Current knowledge of this species is insufficient to properly assess its conservation status. In 2009, Stewart McPherson described the populations from the two known localities as \\"widely distributed, numerous and seldom visited\\". Copper extraction operations in the Mabaho Range are restricted to lower elevations and therefore do not represent a direct threat to this species. Related species Nepenthes surigaoensis is very closely allied to N. merrilliana, with which it was long considered conspecific. It can be distinguished from this species on the basis of its strongly decurrent leaves (as compared to the amplexicaul to slightly decurrent laminae of N. merrilliana), smaller pitchers borne on extremely long tendrils, and coarse indumentum covering the tendrils and pitchers. The pitchers themselves are morphologically very similar, although N. surigaoensis differs in that its aerial traps often retain fringed wings. There are also a number of ecological differences between the two species. Whereas N. surigaoensis is only known from shady lower montane forest, N. merrilliana is commonly associated with more open sites where it is exposed to strong or direct sunlight. Altitudinal distribution is another distinguishing feature; N. merrilliana is a true lowlander growing from sea level to 900 m, and is often found below 500 m. Nepenthes surigaoensis also bears close affinities to N. bellii. It is not easily confused with this species, however, because it is much larger in all respects, particularly in the size of its pitchers and inflorescence. References * Co, L. & W. Suarez 2012.

History At above sea level, Chisbury hillfort is the highest point in Little Bedwyn parishCrowley, 1999, pages 50-69 and encloses an area of about .Pevsner & Cherry, 1975, page 174 Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age artefacts have been found in the area, but the hillfort was most probably built in the late Iron Age in the 1st century AD. The hillfort was re-used in the Anglo-Saxon times as a burh, cited in the Burghal Hidage document which lists the fortifications of Wessex from that time. St. Martin's chapel, on the eastern edge of the hillfort, seems to have been built in the early part of the 13th century. There are written records of it from 1246 onwards and its surviving architecture is contemporary with that period. The windows have the remains of good-quality tracery in a style that suggests they were made in the latter part of the 13th century. Between 1496 and 1518 St. Martin's lacked a priest, but it was served again from 1518 until 1547. Thereafter St. Martin's lapsed from use for worship and was turned into a barn. It was re-roofed in the 19th century but in 1998 its condition was semi-ruinous. The hillfort and chapel were designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1925. Chisbury Manor farmhouse, also within the hillfort site, is a two-storey brick building from the mid 18th century. Knowle Farm, about northwest of Chisbury, has a 14th-century chapel which is now an outbuilding of the farmhouse. A blocked ogee-headed north window and the surround of the east window are the only surviving features.Pevsner & Cherry, 1975, page 463 The farmhouse is a brick-built Georgian house of five bays dated 1735.

He plays primarily as a centre back. An Algerian international, Bella√Ød was part of the Algeria squad at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. As of June 2013, he has one cap. Personal Bella√Ød was born in Bobigny, France, to a Tunisian father and an Algerian mother. Career =Early life= Bella√Ød began his career playing for his local side Red Star Saint-Ouen. During his time as a youth player there, he was teammates with Abou Diaby. In 1999, he was selected to attend the Clairefontaine academy. There, he trained alongside Diaby, Hatem Ben Arfa, and Ricardo Faty and often spent the week training there, while playing with Red Star on the weekends. Following his stint at Clairefontaine, he joined RC Strasbourg. =Strasbourg= Bella√Ød joined Strasbourg in 2002 and quickly asserted himself into the youth academy. He was a part of the Strasbourg youth squad that made it to the finals of the Coupe Gambardella in 2003, before losing to 4‚Äì1 to Rennes. He made his professional debut on 9 November 2004 in a Coupe de la Ligue match against Troyes AC starting the match in the left back position. Strasbourg won the match 3‚Äì1 and eventually went on to win the cup. That league cup appearance was his only appearance that season. Bella√Ød was subsequently promoted to the senior squad for the 2005‚Äì06 season. He proceeded to make his Ligue 1 debut on 17 September 2005 in a match against RC Lens coming on as a substitute in the 70th minute. The match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. He appeared consistently as a starter for the rest of the season. He scored his first professional goal and only goal that season in the UEFA Cup against Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. Unfortunately for Bella√Ød, due to primarily focusing on their European aspirations, Strasbourg finished 2nd from bottom, thus being relegated to Ligue 2. The following season, Strasbourg achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 with Bella√Ød playing in 31 matches and scoring two goals. His return to Ligue 1 was both positive and negative as Bella√Ød's performances gained the attention of several clubs, most notably Italian side Roma and Spanish giants Real Madrid, but the club still suffered relegation, which led the player to ponder his future. =Move to Germany= On 4 July 2008, it was announced that Bella√Ød and Strasbourg had agreed to a move to German club Eintracht Frankfurt. The player agreed to a four-year contract, while the transfer fee was priced at ‚Ç¨2.5 million. He was given the number 19 shirt and made his Bundesliga debut in their opening league match against Hertha Berlin. Eintracht would lose the match 0‚Äì2. Bella√Ød has since made 21 more appearances in the league. =Back to Strasbourg= On 31 August 2009, the French defender left Eintracht Frankfurt and signed for RC Strasbourg on loan until the end of the season. =Loan to Boulogne= After a half-year with his former club RC Strasbourg the club loaned him out to US Boulogne without consulting Eintracht Frankfurt, but at the request of the player Eintracht approved the transfer. International career Bella√Ød has been a France youth international since childhood receiving caps with all of France's youth teams beginning with the U-15s all the way to the U-21s. He was also eligible to play for Tunisia and Algeria, subject to FIFA approval. On 4 May 2010, Bella√Ød was called up to the Algeria preliminary World Cup 2010 squad. He made his debut on 28 May 2010 as a starter in a friendly against the Republic of Ireland, but did not play in the tournament.
